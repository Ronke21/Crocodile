<doc id="145531" wikidata="Q7531823" url="?curid=145531" title="List of locations associated with Arthurian legend">
<text>The following is a list and assessment of sites and places associated with King Arthur and the Arthurian legend in general. Given the lack of concrete historical knowledge about one of the most potent figures in British mythology, it is unlikely that any definitive conclusions about the claims for these places will ever be established; nevertheless it is both interesting and important to try to evaluate the body of evidence which does exist and examine it critically. The earliest association with Arthur of many of the places listed is often surprisingly recent, with most southern sites&#x27; association based on nothing more than the toponymic speculations of recent authors with a local prejudice to promote.

==Burial places==

*Mount Etna, the burial place of King Arthur according to Flouriant et Florete, Guillem de Torroella and Gervase of Tilbury. 
*Wormelow Tump, Herefordshire, the burial place of King Arthur&#x27;s son Amr according to local legend; the mound was flattened to widen the road in 1896.
*It has been suggested that the burial place of Tristan is in Douarnenez (in the island named Ile Tristan) and that of King Marc on the Menez-Hom, a small hill in the parish of Dineault.
*Another contender for Arthur&#x27;s resting place is the Eildon Hills, Roxburghshire.
*Amidst the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey are tombstones claiming to mark the final resting place of Arthur and Guinevere. Glastonbury, which was once surrounded by water, is believed by some to be the Isle of Avalon, the place where the dying Arthur was destined to be healed; if this is the case, it follows that Arthur would be brought to the abbey to receive medical attention. However, Arthur&#x27;s wounds were fatal, and therefore he was buried near the abbey, south of the Lady Chapel. It is said that in the 12th century, monks who wanted to raise money for the abbey dug up two sets of bones (presumably Arthur&#x27;s and Gwynevere&#x27;s) from that location and moved them into the abbey in order to attract pilgrims. The bones were supposedly unearthed within a large oak coffin inscribed with the words, &quot;Here lies Arthur buried in Avalon.&quot;
*Richmond Castle. In the tale of Potter Thompson, Arthur and his knights sleep in a hidden cavern under the castle built by Alan Rufus.

==Arthur&#x27;s courts==
The following are real places which are clearly identifiable in historical texts and which are mentioned in Arthurian legend and romance as being places used by Arthur to hold court. In the romances, Arthur, like all medieval monarchs, moves around his kingdom.

*Caerleon-on-Usk in Newport, southern Wales. From Geoffrey of Monmouth.
*London, Geoffrey of Monmouth.
*Quimper, from the Lancelot-Grail romance.
*Carlisle, Cumberland, on the western edge of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall (assuming Carlisle is really the &quot;Carduel&quot; of the romances).
*Carhaix, &quot;Les premiers faits du roi Arthur&quot;.
*Cardigan, from Chrétien de Troyes.
*St David&#x27;s, one of Arthur&#x27;s three courts in the Welsh Triads.
*Stirling is named in Beroul&#x27;s 12th-century &quot;Romance of Tristan&quot;.

===Unidentified sites===
*Celliwig, Cornwall. Perhaps the earliest known description of a location of an Arthurian court (also in the Welsh Triads). Kelly Rounds near St Mabyn, Cornwall, is cited as one of the potential sites.
*Pen Rhionydd, Arthur&#x27;s northern court in the Welsh Triads. Possibly near Stranraer in Rheged.

====Camelot====

Various places have been identified as the location of Camelot, including many of those listed above. Others include:

* Tintagel Castle, Cornwall, where there is evidence of high-status buildings in the 5th and 6th centuries. A sea cave below the castle is known as Merlin&#x27;s Cave.
* Winchester, Hampshire, is specifically identified as Camelot by Thomas Malory. William Caxton, in his preface to Malory&#x27;s book, said that the Round Table itself was at Winchester Castle, and that anyone who wished to see it could go there.
* Camelon, near Falkirk, which was spelled Camelo prior to the 19th century.
* Cadbury Castle, Somerset, an Iron Age hill fort referred to as a location for Camelot by John Leland in 1542. &quot;At the very south end of the church of South-Cadbyri standeth Camallate, sometime a famous town or castle... The people can tell nothing there but that they have heard Arthur much resorted to Camalat...&quot; A well on the ascent is known locally as Arthur&#x27;s Well, and the highest part of the hill is known as Arthur&#x27;s Palace, these names being recorded as early as the late 16th century.
* Colchester, a town in Essex (or its Roman antecedent Camulodunum), has been cited as one of the potential sites of Camelot. Though the name &quot;Camelot&quot; may be derived from Camulodunum (modern Colchester), the Iron Age capital of the Trinovantes, and later the provincial capital of Roman Britannia, its location close to England&#x27;s east coast – and thus very close to the earliest Anglo-Saxon settlements – places it in the wrong Anglo-Saxon kingdom.
* The ex-Roman fort of Camboglanna on Hadrian&#x27;s Wall.
* Campus Elleti in Glamorgan.
* Caerwent.
** Llanmelin hill fort near Caerwent.
* Camelford, Cornwall.
* Camaret, Brittany, France.
* Saltwell Park in Gateshead.
* Viroconium, Shropshire.
* Chard, Somerset.
* Graig-Llwyn near Lisvane.
* Camlet Moat near Trent Park, by Enfield Chase, London.
* Slack, near Huddersfield; the Romans had a fort named Cambodunum here making the kingdom Elmet.
* Cadbury Camp, Somerset.
* Roxburgh Castle in the Scottish Borders, proposed by Alistair Moffat in his work &quot;Arthur and the Lost Kingdoms&quot;.
* Chester Castle.

==Avalon==
* Isle of Aval in Brittany
* Glastonbury in England
* Sicily
* The Isle of Arran
* The city of Avallon in France
* The North Pole (according to the theories of William F. Warren)

==Reputed Arthurian battle sites==
Twelve of Arthur&#x27;s battles were recorded by Nennius in &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;.
*Battle at the mouth of the river Glein (1st battle), possibly River Glen, Northumberland or River Glen, Lincolnshire.
*Battles of the river Dubglas (2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th battles) in the region of Linnuis. Guesses for the river include the River Trent or the Ancholme. An alternative northern site is the Devil&#x27;s Water at Linnels on Hadrian&#x27;s Wall or the River Douglas, near Wigan. However, the strategic location of the River Douglas in Glen Douglas in Lennox, near the portage at Arrochar from Loch Long (&quot;the Loch of the Ships&quot;) to Loch Lomond, overlooked by Ben Arthur, make it the most likely location.
*Battle of the river of the Bassas (6th battle). Probably a reference to the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth, although possibly also relates to the middle River Witham at Bassingham, the homestead of Bassa&#x27;s people. An alternative northern location is at Bassington on the River Aln in Northumbria, not far from the River Glen.
*Battle of Cat Coit Celidon (7th battle), possibly Caledonian Woods in the Scottish Lowlands.
*Battle of Fort Guinnon (&quot;the White Fort&quot;) (8th battle). Possibly the Binchester Roman fort. Or Wedale in southern Scotland.
*Battle of the City of the Legion (9th battle) Hypothesized sites for this battle include:
**Caerleon, also, according to Geoffrey of Monmouth, the site of Arthur&#x27;s court and Guinevere&#x27;s convent
**Carlisle
**Chester
**York
*Battle of Tribruit (the 10th battle), possibly the mouth of the river Avon near Bo&#x27;ness, Scotland, or near Dumfries.
*Battle of Agned (the 11th battle), probably near Edinburgh as &quot;Mount Agned&quot; was another term for Edinburgh, although possibly at the Roman fort Bremenium, near Rochester, Northumberland
*Battle of Mons Badonicus c. AD 496 (12th battle). The date, location, and contestants of this battle are a matter of considerable debate. Hypothesized sites for Mons Badonicus include:
** Bowden Hill in Linlithgow
** Mynydd Baedan in South Wales
**Badbury Rings, Dorset, an Iron Age hill fort
**Bath or Solsbury Hill near Bath, suggested by Geoffrey of Monmouth
**Buxton, Derbyshire, a hilltop town and the site of a Roman Bath
**Liddington Castle, Wiltshire
**Bardon Hill, Leicestershire
*Battle of Camlann (Arthur&#x27;s last and fatal battle) possibly fought in South Somerset or at Camboglanna near the western section of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. Alternatively, it has been speculated that could have been fought at Camelon in Falkirkshire or Cwm Llan on Snowdon.

==Places with other associations to Arthurian legend==
*Alderley Edge in Cheshire. Legend has it that beneath the hill in a cavern stretching the outcrop of sandstone, King Arthur and the knights of the round table lie sleeping.

*Mount Etna, related to Morgan le Fay.
* Lothian – King Lot

<text>Michael Kenji Shinoda (; born February 11, 1977) is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, and graphic designer. He co-founded the rock band Linkin Park in 1996 and is the band&#x27;s co-lead vocalist, as well as rhythm guitarist, keyboardist, primary songwriter and producer. Shinoda later created a hip-hop-driven side project, Fort Minor, in 2004. He has also served as a producer for tracks and albums by artists such as Lupe Fiasco, Styles of Beyond, and the X-Ecutioners.

Shinoda is also the co-founder of Machine Shop Records, a California-based record label. Outside of music, Shinoda is an artist and graphic designer. He has painted several pieces of artwork, some of which have been featured in the Japanese American National Museum. In 2018, Shinoda released his debut solo album &quot;Post Traumatic&quot;, which consists of 18 songs about his feelings following the death of Chester Bennington, his Linkin Park bandmate.

==Early life==
Michael Kenji Shinoda () was born on February 11, 1977, in the Panorama City neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, and raised in Agoura Hills. His father is Japanese-American. He has a younger brother named Jason, and he was raised as a liberal Protestant. Shinoda&#x27;s mother encouraged him to take classical piano lessons when he was six. By 13, he expressed the desire to move toward playing jazz, blues, and hip hop. He later added the guitar and rap-style vocals to his repertoire during his middle school and high school years.

Shinoda attended Agoura High School with future Linkin Park bandmates Brad Delson and Rob Bourdon. The three formed the band Xero and began to make a more serious attempt to pursue a career in the music industry. After graduating high school, Shinoda enrolled in the Art Center College of Design of Pasadena to study graphic design and illustration. He attended classes with DJ and turntablist Joe Hahn. While studying at the Art Center College of Design, he experienced a form of identity crisis. Years later, he told an interviewer:

Shinoda graduated in 1998 with a Bachelor of Arts in Illustration and obtained a job as a graphic designer.

==Career==
===Linkin Park===

Shinoda founded Linkin Park with Rob Bourdon and Brad Delson in 1996. They eventually brought in turntablist Joe Hahn, bassist Dave Farrell, and vocalist Mark Wakefield. The earliest incarnation of the band was called Xero. The band was limited in resources and originally produced and recorded music in Shinoda&#x27;s bedroom, which resulted in the release of a four-track demo tape, entitled &quot;Xero&quot;, in 1997. When the band was unable to find a record deal, Wakefield and Farrell left the band to pursue other musical interests, though Farrell&#x27;s departure turned out to be temporary. The band later recruited Chester Bennington and successfully landed a record deal with Warner Bros Records. Linkin Park&#x27;s first studio album, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; went on to become a breakthrough success and helped the band attain international success.

Shinoda is closely involved in the technical aspects of the band&#x27;s recordings; over the subsequent releases, that role continued to expand. Shinoda, with guitarist Brad Delson, engineered and produced the band&#x27;s &quot;Hybrid Theory EP&quot;, and performed similar roles in the recording of &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;. He has contributed to the instrumental and lyrical composition on most of Linkin Park&#x27;s songs. Though Bennington primarily served as Linkin Park&#x27;s lead vocalist, he occasionally shared the role with Shinoda. Bennington had a higher pitched and emotional style of singing, whereas Shinoda has a baritone hip-hop style delivery. Shinoda organized and oversaw the band&#x27;s first remix album &quot;Reanimation&quot; in 2002, contributing his own production of remixes that he made in his home studio for &quot;Crawling&quot; and &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot;. Shinoda collaborated with graffiti artist DELTA, graphic designer Frank Maddocks, and bandmate Joe Hahn to prepare &quot;Reanimation&quot;″s artwork. Mike also collaborated with the Flem, Delta, James R. Minchin III, Nick Spanos, and Joe Hahn for the artwork of the band&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Meteora&quot;. Shinoda also produced the album, with his bandmates and Don Gilmore which was his first production experience. By the release of the Jay-Z and Linkin Park collaborative mashup EP, entitled &quot;Collision Course&quot; in 2004, Shinoda&#x27;s involvement in the creation of the albums continued to grow. He produced and mixed the album, which won the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in 2006. 
The band released their next album, &quot;Minutes to Midnight&quot;, on May 14, 2007. On this album, Shinoda shared a production credit with longtime producer Rick Rubin. This album was also the first time that Shinoda, best known for his rapping, sang a featured vocal (even though he sang backing vocals for their previous two albums). Shinoda sang in the songs &quot;In Between&quot; and the B-side song, &quot;No Roads Left&quot;, as well as rapping and singing in the songs &quot;Bleed It Out&quot; and &quot;Hands Held High&quot;. Despite the rarity of Shinoda-fronted singing tracks, music magazine &quot;Hit Parader&quot; ranked him at number 72 of the Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time.
Shinoda and Rubin again shared a production credit for Linkin Park&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;A Thousand Suns&quot;, which was released on September 14, 2010. This album featured more of his singing than rapping. Shinoda raps in three tracks, specifically &quot;When They Come for Me&quot;, &quot;Wretches and Kings&quot; and second single &quot;Waiting for the End&quot;, while he sings on numerous songs (specifically verses), such as third single &quot;Burning in the Skies&quot;, &quot;Robot Boy&quot;, &quot;Blackout&quot;, fourth single &quot;Iridescent&quot; and lead single &quot;The Catalyst&quot;. Bennington and Shinoda sang simultaneously together on &quot;The Catalyst&quot;, &quot;Jornada del Muerto&quot; and &quot;Robot Boy&quot;, while &quot;Iridescent&quot; features all band members singing together.

Linkin Park released their fifth album, &quot;Living Things&quot;, on June 26, 2012. This album was stated as more &quot;rap-centric&quot; by Shinoda compared to the previous two albums. Whereas there were tracks like &quot;Skin to Bone&quot;, &quot;Roads Untraveled&quot; and &quot;Castle of Glass&quot; which featured the singing vocals by Shinoda and had folk music, influenced by the works of Bob Dylan, as well as the inspirations of Dylan. Allmusic described Shinoda&#x27;s work for the album as, &quot;a fitting soundtrack for aging rap-rockers who are comfortable in their skin but restless at heart&quot;. &quot;Recharged&quot;, which is a remix album consisting remixes of original songs from &quot;Living Things&quot;, was released on October 29, 2013. Shinoda used his EDM experience he got from Avicii while working on the track &quot;Wake Me Up&quot;, and also from Steve Aoki while working on &quot;A Light That Never Comes&quot;, to remix some songs for the album. Shinoda reinterpreted songs like &quot;Castle of Glass&quot; and &quot;Victimized&quot;. He also worked with his old friends like DJ Vice and Ryu for the album.
In 2014, Shinoda worked with Delson to produce the band&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;The Hunting Party&quot;, which was released on June 17, 2014. The album is the first one to have featuring artists like Page Hamilton of Helmet, Rakim, Daron Malakian of System of a Down, and Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine. The first single of the album, &quot;Guilty All the Same&quot;, is the first non-remix song by the band to feature rap by a guest artist instead of Shinoda.

The pre-production of their seventh studio album began in mid-2015 during The Hunting Party Tour by Shinoda on his phone. In 2017, Shinoda again worked with Delson on the production of &quot;One More Light&quot;. The album is the first to feature other songwriters rather than the band itself. The album overall includes mainly singing rather than rapping from Shinoda; Good Goodbye&quot; is a song that features rapping from Shinoda, Stormzy and Pusha T. Following Chester Bennington&#x27;s death months later, the band cancelled their tour in support of the album and went on an indefinite hiatus.

In September 2024, along with fellow band members of Linkin Park, Shinoda announced they would be collaborating with new co-vocalist Emily Armstrong and drummer Colin Brittain for their next new album, &quot;From Zero&quot;.

===Fort Minor===

In 2004, Shinoda formed a side project called Fort Minor, which he used as an avenue to further showcase his hip-hop background. He explained the origin of the project&#x27;s name in an interview stating,

Shinoda began recording songs for this side project following the release of Collision Course in November 2004. &quot;Fort Minor: We Major&quot; was a mixtape by Shinoda and DJ Green Lantern to promote his upcoming studio album. &quot;The Rising Tied&quot;, the debut album of Fort Minor, was released in November 2005. Robert Hales directed its first video &quot;Petrified&quot;, which was released the previous month.
Fort Minor&#x27;s debut album, titled &quot;The Rising Tied&quot;, was released on November 22, 2005. The album featured musical collaborations from Styles of Beyond, Lupe Fiasco, Common, Black Thought of the Roots, John Legend, Holly Brook, Jonah Matranga, and Celph Titled. Jay-Z, who had previously collaborated with Linkin Park on the 2004 album &quot;Collision Course&quot;, also served as the album&#x27;s executive producer. Shinoda told Corey Moss of MTV News that he imposed on himself a requirement to play all the instruments and write all the lyrics to the album, except for the strings, percussion, or choir parts. &quot;The Rising Tied&quot; was positively received by critics. The album&#x27;s most successful single, &quot;Where&#x27;d You Go&quot;, peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Other songs like, &quot;Petrified&quot; and &quot;Remember the Name&quot; gained popularity when they were used as the soundtrack for NBA Overtime on TNT. Another track, &quot;Kenji&quot;, describes the experiences of a Japanese-American family during the Japanese American internment of World War II.

Due to the success of &quot;Where&#x27;d You Go&quot; during the week of April 26, 2006, sales of &quot;The Rising Tied&quot; increased by 45 percent, and the album chart position went up 89 positions to No. 104 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.&quot; &quot;Where&#x27;d You Go&quot; was awarded Ringtone of the Year at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards. In mid August 2006 Fort Minor performed at the Summer Sonic 2006 alongside Linkin Park.

In November 2006, Fort Minor released a video for &quot;Where&#x27;d You Go.&quot; Shinoda has stated he felt the video was a nice wrap-up for Fort Minor. Also in November, Shinoda stated that Fort Minor would go on an indefinite hiatus, because of his dedication to Linkin Park. In the &quot;Billboard&quot; One-hit Wonders of the 2000s, Fort Minor (along with Holly Brook and Jonah Matranga) were listed at No. 19, due to the success of &quot;Where&#x27;d You Go&quot; (since it was Fort Minor&#x27;s only single that reached the top 25). In an interview in 2014, Shinoda stated that there could be a possible Fort Minor album in 2015.

On June 21, 2015, Shinoda officially confirmed Fort Minor&#x27;s return with a status update and the release of a new single, &quot;Welcome&quot;. Fort Minor also appeared as the musical guest on the TBS late-night talk show &quot;Conan&quot; on Monday, June 22. Fort Minor also appeared on a few shows during Linkin Park&#x27;s touring schedule.

===Solo work===
On January 25, 2018, Shinoda released the &quot;Post Traumatic&quot; EP, featuring three songs about his own feelings in the aftermath of Chester Bennington&#x27;s death on July 20, 2017. Shinoda released the EP under his own name instead of under his side-project, Fort Minor.

On March 8, 2018, Shinoda announced through social media that he was working on a new solo album. He also added that he was in Los Angeles filming a music video and also invited fans to appear in the video, including a map of the old Tower Records in Hollywood, California. Shinoda performed in Los Angeles on May 12 as part of Identity LA, marking one of his first performances since Bennington&#x27;s death. On March 28, 2018, the 2018 Reading &amp; Leeds Festivals roster was announced, with Shinoda included. He performed on August 25 and 26 as part of the Reading &amp; Leeds Festivals, joining artists and bands such as Post Malone, Panic! at the Disco, Dua Lipa, Brockhampton, and Travis Scott; Fall Out Boy, Kendrick Lamar, and Kings of Leon were headlining the event. The next day, Shinoda released two new songs, &quot;Crossing a Line&quot; and &quot;Nothing Makes Sense Anymore,&quot; from his upcoming studio album, &quot;Post Traumatic&quot; which was released on June 15. On March 29, 2018, Shinoda did an interview with KROQ where his single “Crossing a Line” was debuted on the radio. On April 26, 2018, Shinoda released a song, &quot;About You,&quot; featuring hip hop artist, Blackbear. About a month later he revealed that he would be releasing a new song called &quot;Running From My Shadow&quot; which featured Grandson. Another single was released just a few weeks after &quot;Running From My Shadow&quot; was released. The new single, &quot;Ghosts&quot;, was released on June 7, 2018, 6 days before the release of &quot;Post Traumatic&quot;.

On October 30, 2019, Shinoda announced that he would be releasing a new single, &quot;Fine&quot;, two days later, on November 1.

In March 2020, Shinoda began sharing new musical content by live streaming from his home studio. He called these tracks, &quot;CoronaJams&quot;, after the COVID-19 pandemic. Shinoda later released these tracks over three separate albums beginning in July: &quot;Dropped Frames, Vol. 1&quot;, &quot;Dropped Frames, Vol. 2&quot;, and &quot;Dropped Frames, Vol. 3&quot;.

On February 19, 2021, Shinoda released a single titled &quot;Happy Endings&quot;. The song features guest vocals from Iann Dior and Upsahl. Shinoda also remixed the Deftones song &quot;Passenger&quot; which earned him a Grammy at the 2022 Grammy Awards for the category of Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical. On March 10, 2023, in the midst of re-releasing Linkin Park&#x27;s &quot;Meteora&quot; to celebrate its 20th anniversary, Shinoda released a new solo single titled &quot;In My Head&quot; as part of the soundtrack to the film &quot;Scream VI&quot;. The pop rock song contains a feature appearance from Kailee Morgue. Shinoda also produced and co-wrote &quot;Still Alive&quot;, a song recorded by Demi Lovato which also appears in the film. On October 6, 2023 Shinoda released a new track titled &quot;Already Over&quot;. Soon after, on December 1, 2023 &quot;The Crimson Chapter&quot; EP was released, containing multiple remixed versions of &quot;Already Over&quot;, &quot;In My Head&quot; and a remix of &quot;Fine&quot;.

===Art and painting===

Shinoda has had a hand in most artistic facets of Linkin Park&#x27;s imagery, including the group&#x27;s album artwork, band merchandise, web design, and on-stage production art. He designed the cover art for Styles of Beyond&#x27;s debut album, &quot;2000 Fold&quot;, Saukrates&#x27; debut album, &quot;The Underground Tapes&quot;, and DJ Frane&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Frane&#x27;s Fantastic Boatride&quot;, all released in 1999. He has also worked on several art projects throughout his career.

In 2003, he did a collaborative &quot;remix&quot; shoe for DC Shoes, remixing the &quot;Clientele&quot;. He reworked the colors and materials for the shoe, and additionally designed all the packaging and print advertisements. The following year, he also designed a customization of a Kid Robot &quot;Munny&quot; doll for a charity auction. Later in 2008, Shinoda partnered with DC Shoes again on a second DC Remix Series project. The new collaboration featured a &quot;great juxtaposition of Shinoda&#x27;s unique influences: accomplished artist versus recording-breaking musician, American upbringing versus Japanese heritage.&quot; The MS/DC limited edition remix has two different versions – Xander and Pride. Roughly 2000 pairs of the limited edition shoes were made available for purchase when the sneaker was released on August 1, 2008.

In 2004, Shinoda created a series of ten paintings which became the basis of the Fort Minor debut album, &quot;The Rising Tied&quot;. That series became the backbone for the packaging of the album, and was featured in Shinoda&#x27;s first public art show &quot;Diamonds Spades Hearts &amp; Clubs&quot;. In addition to the ten Fort Minor pieces, the show also featured thirteen more original works and five collaborative pieces. &quot;Diamonds Spades Hearts &amp; Clubs&quot; opened at Gallery 1988 on Sunday, November 19, 2006. Later that year, Shinoda founded a college scholarship at Art Center College of Design to benefit future illustration and graphic design students. Named the Michael K. Shinoda Endowed Scholarship, it is awarded based on financial need and merit. The scholarship was awarded for the first time in 2006. The scholarship fund is made possible through the sale of his original artwork on his website, art shows and his DC Shoes projects.

On July 11, 2008, Shinoda&#x27;s second public art show &quot;Glorious Excess (BORN)&quot; premiered at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. The show included nine new pieces, with an exclusive signing on opening night. The show served as part one of the two-part &quot;Glorious Excess&quot; series, with the second installment &quot;Glorious Excess (DIES)&quot; due at JANM on August 22, 2009. Shinoda commented on the inspiration behind the &quot;Glorious Excess&quot; series, stating, &quot;It Got to a point where the pervasiveness of &#x27;celebrity news&#x27; concerned me. It seemed like it has jumped out of its niche into places where it doesn&#x27;t belong. I would be watching the news, and thinking, &#x27;of all the things going on in the world right now, why are they covering so-and-so&#x27;s breakup?&#x27; It didn&#x27;t make sense to me. Add to that the fact that I&#x27;m supposed to somehow &#x27;belong&#x27; to that celebrity group—and I really don&#x27;t feel like I do in a lot of ways—and you can see how the topic started to become really interesting to me. The Glorious Excess (BORN) show was my way of diving into those topics, trying to find answers. It follows a central &#x27;celebrity&#x27; character, who is filthy rich, slightly violent, and famous without any particular skill or talent.&quot;

On November 6, 2014, Shinoda and Hahn painted an artwork on the Berlin Wall.

===Other musical activities===

Shinoda has also served as a music producer for several other artists and groups. In 2002, Shinoda and Joe Hahn collaborated with the X-Ecutioners to produce and perform on their single &quot;It&#x27;s Goin&#x27; Down&quot;. Later in 2002, Shinoda and Brad Delson established their own record label, Machine Shop Recordings. He helped produce Lupe Fiasco&#x27;s 2006 release,&quot; Food &amp; Liquor&quot;. He extensively worked with Styles of Beyond between 2009 and 2012 to help produce &quot;Reseda Beach&quot;, which also features his instrumental and vocal contribution. In addition albums, Shinoda scored the MTV VMA&#x27;s in 2005 and also worked with Ramin Djawadi to score the video game, &quot;Medal of Honor: Warfighter&quot;. In 2011, he collaborated with Joseph Trapanese to compose the score for the American release of &quot;The Raid: Redemption&quot;.

In 2004, he released a remixed single and animated music video of the 1990 Depeche Mode single, &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot;. In 2005, Shinoda hosted the &quot;Rock Phenomenon&quot; mixtape/remix CD with DJ Vlad and Roc Raida. The CD is the first (and to date, only) in DJ Vlad&#x27;s &quot;Rock Phenomenon&quot; series (which itself is a spin-off of Vlad&#x27;s &quot;Rap Phenomenon&quot; mixtape series), and features a mashup of Linkin Park&#x27;s &quot;Papercut&quot;, and David Banner&#x27;s &quot;Like a Pimp (Remix)&quot;. For the 2006 Grammy awards, Shinoda and Brad Delson assembled the mashup track of &quot;Numb/Encore&quot; and &quot;Yesterday&quot; by the Beatles to be performed live by rapper Jay-Z, Linkin Park and former Beatles singer Paul McCartney. Shinoda teamed up with former bandmate Mark Wakefield to record and release a single, &quot;Barack Your World&quot;, in October 2008.

Shinoda contributed to the music for the CNN original documentary television series, &quot;This Is Life with Lisa Ling&quot;. Shinoda contributed the title theme for American television series &quot;Into the Badlands&quot;. Shinoda also created and provided the theme song for Noor Tagouri&#x27;s &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Job&quot;.

==Other ventures==
===Machine Shop Records===

As Linkin Park succeeded in multi-platinum record sales, Warner Music Group granted Shinoda his own record label in 1999. It was first known as &quot;The Shinoda Imprint&quot;. He and bandmate Brad Delson together worked on the label in 2004 and renamed it to Machine Shop Records. The label signed several artists through late 2007.

===Philanthropy===

Music for Relief is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization dedicated to providing aid to survivors of natural disasters and the prevention of such disasters through environmental programs. Music for Relief was founded by Linkin Park in response to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Since its inception in 2005, Music for Relief has raised over $8 million for the victims of various natural disasters, including the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the October 2007 California wildfires, cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh, the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, hurricane Sandy, and typhoon Haiyan.

==Musical style and influences==
Shinoda was greatly inspired by both rock and hip-hop acts when he was a child. He grew up listening to Boogie Down Productions, Public Enemy, N.W.A, and Juice Crew, and later Nine Inch Nails, Deftones, the Roots and Aphex Twin. Other influences and favorites of Shinoda&#x27;s include Led Zeppelin, Run-DMC, the Beatles, Rage Against the Machine, Purity Ring, Arctic Monkeys and Santigold. In an interview about his work with Linkin Park as their sound evolved over time from heavy metal toward a more electronic approach, Shinoda explained in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that &quot;We want to hopefully move even more into being able to make more substantial music. We&#x27;re definitely paying attention to the substance and the nuance, and we hope to make something that&#x27;s really cutting edge and really different.&quot;

In an &quot;Impericon&quot; interview, Shinoda stated his &#x27;non-definitive&#x27; top three bands of all time to be Nine Inch Nails, Led Zeppelin, and Creedence Clearwater Revival.

Various critics have compared Shinoda&#x27;s rapping style to that of fellow rapper Eminem. A reviewer for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; noted that Shinoda&#x27;s vocals were &quot;flowing like Eminem on Ambien&quot; An editor for &quot;Uncut&quot; stated that &quot;The Rising Tied&quot; was &quot;bound to please fans of Linkin Park and Eminem alike.&quot; Jo Timbuong of &quot;The Star&quot; compared &quot;Where&#x27;d You Go&quot; to Eminem&#x27;s song &quot;When I&#x27;m Gone&quot;, noting the former as &quot;more melancholic.&quot; A reviewer of the &quot;Scripps Howard News Service&quot; stated that Shinoda&#x27;s rapping is &quot;a smidge closer to Eminem than he is to Vanilla Ice.&quot;

==Personal life==
Shinoda is a third-generation Japanese American (). His grandfather and aunt were both interned in a Japanese-American internment camp during World War II.

Shinoda married author Anna Hillinger in 2003; together, they have three children.

Shinoda was awarded with the Japanese American National Museum&#x27;s Award of Excellence in 2006.

<text>&quot;A World of Difference&quot; is the twenty-third episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Arthur Curtis is a successful businessman planning a vacation to San Francisco with his loving wife Marian. After arriving at his office and talking with his secretary Sally, he finds that his telephone is not functional and, hearing someone yell &quot;cut&quot;, he discovers his office is a movie set on a sound stage. He is told that Arthur Curtis is merely a character he is playing, and that his real identity is Gerald Raigan, a movie star who is caught in the aftermath of a brutal divorce from his hostile ex-wife Nora, his own alcoholism and a declining career. Apparently his behavior has been deteriorating for some time and the studio is fed up with him, thinking that he is simply faking mental illness to avoid his responsibilities. The director warns Raigan/Curtis that he will likely be fired if he leaves, but Raigan/Curtis ignores him and departs the studio to go home. Outside, he is nearly hit by a car driven by Nora, who demands the money awarded her from their divorce settlement, though Raigan/Curtis insists he doesn&#x27;t know who Nora is. They leave together in the car.

Raigan/Curtis tries in vain to locate Arthur Curtis&#x27;s house, and mistakes a little girl for his daughter and grabs her — causing her to flee in terror. Nora drives him to their supposed real home. Inside, he meets Brinkley, his (Raigan&#x27;s) agent, who tells him that if he fails to continue work that day, he will drop him as a client. Curtis still protests that he is not Raigan, and tries to call his workplace, but the operator cannot find any listing of it. Brinkley believes that he is having a nervous breakdown, and shows him the shooting script of a movie called &quot;The Private World of Arthur Curtis&quot;. He then tells Raigan/Curtis that the movie is being canceled due to his current outburst and his ongoing issues.

Raigan/Curtis rushes back to the set, which is being dismantled, and pleads not to be left in the miserable world of Gerald Raigan. His office miraculously reappears as it was before, just as Marian arrives. Sally gives him his plane tickets. As Raigan/Curtis hears echoes of the workers dismantling the studio, he embraces Marian and desperately tells her that he never wants to lose her; and that they should leave for their vacation immediately. They then quickly exit his office and head to the airport. Meanwhile, in the other world, Brinkley shows up on the set to find that Raigan has vanished. Some of the crew saw him return to the set, but no one saw him leave. Perplexed, Brinkley wonders where Raigan might have gone. As the set is taken apart, the &quot;Arthur Curtis&quot; script lies amidst a cluttered desk, waiting to be thrown away. An airplane is seen, having just taken off and vanishing into thin air, hinting that Raigan/Curtis escaped into the world he wanted.

<text>Bradford Philip Delson (born December 1, 1977) is an American musician. He is the lead guitarist and one of the founding members of the rock band Linkin Park.

==Early life==
Delson was born and raised in Agoura Hills, California. He attended Agoura High School with his friend, Mike Shinoda. Delson played the trumpet, and later began playing the guitar when he was 12 years old. He enjoyed listening to Guns N&#x27; Roses and Metallica. He played in the rock band Relative Degree with drummer Rob Bourdon, but the group disbanded after their first live show.

Delson attended UCLA, where he was roommates with bassist Dave Farrell for three years. He majored in communication studies, and later interned for Jeff Blue, then the vice president of A&amp;R for Zomba Music. Blue shared his insight and experience on the music industry with Delson, while also giving him constructive feedback on musical projects. Delson graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in communication studies from UCLA in 1999. He considered attending law school after graduation but instead pursued a career as a professional musician.

==Music career==
===Linkin Park=== 

Delson, alongside Mike Shinoda and Rob Bourdon, founded Xero, the earliest incarnation of Linkin Park, in 1996. The band soon recruited vocalist Mark Wakefield, bassist Dave Farrell, and turntablist Joe Hahn. After Wakefield left Xero, Delson turned to his former boss Jeff Blue from Zomba Music to help find a replacement. Blue introduced the band to Chester Bennington, who successfully auditioned and became the band&#x27;s full-time vocalist. Blue later became the vice president of A&amp;R for Warner Bros. Records, and helped the band sign a record deal.

Delson played guitar on all eight of Linkin Park&#x27;s albums. He also played bass on &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; when Farrell temporarily left Linkin Park to tour with another band. After the release of &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, Delson was closely involved with the production and creative direction of Linkin Park&#x27;s sound alongside Shinoda. The two co-produced &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; (2014) and &quot;One More Light&quot; (2017). While working on &quot;The Hunting Party&quot;, record producer Rick Rubin encouraged Delson to showcase his guitar playing by including more guitar solos compared to the band&#x27;s previous albums. Delson commented on the new approach, &quot;On the last few records I certainly played guitar in the studio, but I&#x27;d been focusing on other instruments… But these songs are all about rediscovering the guitar and having a lot of fun with it.&quot; He also oversaw the band&#x27;s business operations, including their marketing and finance, alongside bandmates Farrell and Bourdon. 

Delson and Linkin Park entered a seven-year hiatus following the sudden death of Chester Bennington in 2017. The band announced their reunion with new members in September 2024, and the band&#x27;s eighth album, &quot;From Zero&quot;, was released in November, which Delson co-produced. Delson later revealed that he would not be joining the band on tour, preferring to work in the studio and behind the scenes. Alex Feder performs in his place, but Delson remains an official member of the band, and states that he is not ruling out a return to touring in the future.

===Machine Shop Records===

Delson and Shinoda founded their own record label, Machine Shop Records, in 2001. Delson explained his rationale behind founding his own record label, commenting, &quot;Too many people in the music industry tried to preserve the status quo instead of embracing innovation.&quot;

== Discography ==
=== With Linkin Park ===

* &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; (2000)
* &quot;Meteora&quot; (2003)
* &quot;Minutes to Midnight&quot; (2007)
* &quot;A Thousand Suns&quot; (2010)
* &quot;Living Things&quot; (2012)
* &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; (2014)
* &quot;One More Light&quot; (2017)
* &quot;From Zero&quot; (2024)

== Playing style and equipment ==

Delson has stated that he &quot;doesn&#x27;t like to show off&quot;, and that he attempts to play his guitar so that it sounds as though it were the keyboard or strings so as to seamlessly fit in with the band&#x27;s hip-hop- and electronica-style compositions. Delson has also stated that he likes to produce a gritty, &quot;sampled&quot; feel with his sound. Although a self-described &quot;fervent opponent of guitar leads,&quot; he started performing solos in the &quot;Minutes to Midnight&quot; era after his bandmates encouraged him to do so. Delson performs guitar solos on the tracks &quot;What I&#x27;ve Done&quot;, &quot;In Pieces&quot;, and &quot;The Little Things Give You Away.&quot; Delson also played many solos on Linkin Park&#x27;s 6th studio album &quot;The Hunting Party&quot;.

Delson typically performs while wearing a pair of Shure brand headphones, in order to protect his hearing.

Delson&#x27;s equipment includes the following:

=== Amplifiers and current rig ===
For the first two albums, he used Mesa/Boogie Dual Rectifiers and modified Marshall 1959SLP reissue heads live and in the studio, but during the recording of &quot;Minutes to Midnight&quot; Delson decided not to use much of his old equipment to give him a new sound. Delson used several vintage and rare amplifiers such as Soldano SLOs, Marshall JCM 800, Mesa Boogie Dual Rectifier, a 1972 50-watt Hiwatt Custom, a Bogner Uberschall, and an extremely rare Bo Diddley amplifier with an onboard tape delay that was probably made for Diddley by Watkins (WEM). During live performances, Delson relies on several Randall MTS Modules to recreate the sound from these different amplifiers.

In 2014, the Randall rig was eventually phased out for a Fractal Axe-FX II setup, which is run direct into the PA system and a Matrix GT1000FX power amp. The only analog effect pedals being used are a Devi Ever Shoegazer fuzz, Electro-Harmonix H.O.G., and a Boss NS-2 Noise Suppressor.

<text>&quot;Long Live Walter Jameson&quot; is episode 24 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

==Opening narration==
The narration continues after the camera cuts to an elderly man seated among the students during Jameson&#x27;s lecture.

==Plot==
Walter Jameson, a college professor, is engaged to a young doctoral student named Susanna Kittridge. Susanna&#x27;s father, Sam Kittridge, another professor at Jameson&#x27;s college, becomes suspicious of Jameson because he does not appear to have aged in the twelve years they have known each other and seems to have unrealistically detailed knowledge of some pieces of history that do not appear in texts. Jameson at one point reads from an original Civil War diary in his possession. Later, Kittridge spots the diary&#x27;s author, Major Hugh Skelton, in a Mathew Brady Civil War photograph and finds Jameson looks exactly like Skelton.

After Kittridge presents these pieces of evidence, Jameson ultimately reveals his real life history. Agelessness (but no immunity to injury) was imparted to him by an alchemist more than 2,000 years ago. Jameson does not know what was done to him, only that the alchemist was gone when he recovered, and he then stopped aging. Soon, he had to become a constant refugee. He tells Kittridge he has learned from living for so long that the point of death is to make life meaningful. He keeps a revolver in his desk drawer, but does not have the courage to use it.

Realizing that if Jameson marries his daughter, she will grow old, and Jameson will eventually abandon her in order to keep his secret, Kittridge refuses permission for Jameson to marry his daughter. Jameson defies him by proposing to Susanna that they immediately elope. Kittridge vows to expose Jameson, but he reminds Kittridge that no one will believe him.

Briefly stopping at his study, Jameson is accosted by a woman named Laurette, who identifies him as Tom Bowen, her husband. Laurette claims she cannot allow Jameson to abandon Susanna as he abandoned her years ago. She discovers Jameson&#x27;s pistol lying on his desk and shoots him. Shortly after Bowen leaves, Kittridge enters Jameson&#x27;s study and finds him bleeding, but seemingly at peace. Jameson rapidly ages and collapses on the floor. Susanna enters the house. Kittridge tries to stop her from seeing the aged Jameson, saying only that he is gone. He is unable to keep her out of the room, but inside she discovers only an empty suit of clothes with a white substance near the collar and sleeves. When Susanna asks what is on the floor, the professor replies, &quot;Dust, only dust.&quot;

==Closing narration==
==Makeup effects==
The scenes of Walter Jameson&#x27;s aging were performed by using an old movie-making trick. Age lines were drawn on actor Kevin McCarthy&#x27;s face in red make-up. During the beginning of the scene, red lighting was used, bathing the scene in red and hiding the age lines. As the scene progressed, the red lights were turned down and green lights were brought up. Under the green lights, the red age lines were prominent. The lighting changes were unseen by the audience because it was filmed in black-and-white. A subsequent episode, &quot;Queen of the Nile&quot;, used a similar effect.

==Home media==
For the DVD release Kevin McCarthy returned to record an audio commentary for the episode, revealing that he never met Rod Serling and that, aside from &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot;, his appearance in this episode generated the most fan mail he ever received.

<doc id="145540" wikidata="Q1339044" url="?curid=145540" title="Aldus Corporation">
<text>Aldus Corporation was an American software company best known for its pioneering desktop publishing software. PageMaker, the company&#x27;s most well-known product, ushered in the modern era of desktop computers such as the Macintosh seeing widespread use in the publishing industry. Paul Brainerd, the company&#x27;s co-founder, coined the term &quot;desktop publishing&quot; to describe this paradigm. The company also originated the Tag Image File Format (TIFF) file format, widely used in the digital graphics profession.

Aldus was founded by Brainerd (who also served as chairman of the company&#x27;s board), Jeremy Jaech, Mark Sundstrom, Mike Templeman, and Dave Walter. It was founded in Seattle in 1984 and was acquired by Adobe Systems a decade later.

The company was named after 15th-century Venetian printer Aldus Manutius.

==History==
PageMaker was released in July 1985 and relied on Adobe&#x27;s PostScript page description language. For output, it used the Apple LaserWriter, a PostScript laser printer. PageMaker for the PC was released in 1986.

In 1988, Aldus released an illustration program, FreeHand, which was licensed from Fontographer developer Altsys. FreeHand competed directly with Adobe Illustrator, which had been released a year earlier. The rivalry continued for years, even after Adobe acquired Aldus in 1994, because FreeHand was not included, but Adobe eventually acquired Freehand in 2005 with its acquisition of Macromedia. FreeHand MX was the last version offered by Adobe but is no longer sold or updated.

In early 1990, Aldus bought Silicon Beach Software, acquiring many consumer titles for the Macintosh, including SuperPaint, Digital Darkroom, SuperCard, Super3D, and Personal Press (later renamed Adobe Home Publisher). Silicon Beach was located in San Diego, California, and became the Aldus Consumer Division.

In 1993, Aldus bought After Hours Software and incorporated its products, TouchBase Pro and DateBook Pro, into the Aldus Consumer Division. In the same year, it acquired Company of Science and Art (CoSA).

In September 1994, Adobe purchased Aldus for $446 million. At that time, PageMaker was steadily losing market share to QuarkXPress, but Adobe was still five years from launching their own desktop publisher, InDesign. In 2001, after two major releases under Adobe, PageMaker was discontinued and users were urged to switch to the two-year-old InDesign.

Aldus developed the TIFF and OPI industry standards. The three founders of Visio Corporation left Aldus in 1990 to create the product which later became known as Microsoft Office Visio.

===Company name===
Paul Brainerd and the other Aldus partners named the company after Aldus Pius Manutius, a renowned fifteenth-century Venetian pioneer in publishing known for standardizing the rules of punctuation and also presenting several typefaces, including the first italic. Manutius later founded the first modern publishing house, the Aldine Press.

<text>Barry William Zito (born May 13, 1978) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played 15 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants. His pitching repertoire consisted of a curveball (his strikeout pitch), a four-seam fastball, a two-seam fastball, a circle changeup, and a cutter–slider.

Zito attended the University of California, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles Pierce College, and the University of Southern California. Drafted three times while in college, Zito signed with the Athletics when they chose him in the first round of the 1999 MLB draft. A year later, he was in the major leagues, finishing sixth in American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award voting. He struggled to begin the 2001 season but improved greatly down the stretch, finishing the year with an 11–1 win–loss record over his final two months. He won 23 games (while only losing five) in 2002 and won the Cy Young Award. His record was only 14–12 in 2003, but he still made the All-Star team for the second year in a row. In 2004, he had his worst season, going 11–11 with a career-high 4.48 earned run average. He became Oakland&#x27;s Opening Day starter in 2005 and finished fifth in the AL with 171 strikeouts. In 2006, he made the All-Star team and posted a 15–1 record when receiving two or more runs.

Following his seventh season with the Athletics, Zito signed a seven-year deal with the Giants in December 2006. It was the largest contract ever given to a pitcher. He posted double-digit wins in his first three seasons, and in 2010 he helped San Francisco win their first championship since 1954. However, he struggled the last month of the season and was left off the postseason roster. After sitting out much of the 2011 season with a foot and ankle injury, he returned in 2012 and flourished, finishing with a 15–8 record, his best season in a Giants uniform. The same October, Zito helped lead the Giants to their second World Series title in San Francisco history over the Detroit Tigers by going 2–0 with a 1.69 ERA in three postseason starts. In his first World Series start, he outdueled Tigers&#x27; ace Justin Verlander in Game 1, setting the stage for San Francisco&#x27;s sweep to their seventh World Series title in franchise history. Zito struggled in 2013 but received a standing ovation from the fans in his final appearance as a Giant. Following that year, he became a free agent, and after sitting out the 2014 season he returned to the Athletics for 3 games in 2015 before retiring. Zito, a philanthropist, founded &quot;Strikeouts for Troops&quot;, a national non-profit that provides the comforts of home and lifts the spirits and morale of injured troops as well as offering support to military families.

==Early life and education==
Zito was born May 13, 1978, in Las Vegas, Nevada, to Roberta (née Rosser; 1943–2008) and Joe Zito (1928-2013). He is of Italian descent. His parents were a show-business couple working for singer and pianist Nat King Cole and he had two sisters who were 9 and 13 years older than Barry. His family moved to San Diego, California, to help him concentrate on his baseball career after he showed signs of promise from a very young age. Not knowing much about baseball, his father began reading books about pitching strategy and even stopped working to help coach his son. At the age of 12, Randy Jones, a former Cy Young Award winner, was hired by his father to give him lessons at $50 an hour. He transferred from El Cajon&#x27;s Grossmont High School, where he was the star pitcher, to University of San Diego High School, a Roman Catholic private school for his senior year. Zito received many league honors there, posting an 8-4 record with a 2.92 ERA, while racking up 105 strikeouts in just 85 innings.

==College career==
Zito then attended UC Santa Barbara where he earned Freshman All-America Honors with 125 strikeouts in innings. In his sophomore season, Zito transferred to Los Angeles Pierce College so that he could be eligible for the Major League Baseball draft. At Pierce, he posted a 2.62 earned run average (ERA), went 9–2 with 135 strikeouts in 103 innings, and was named to the all-state and all-conference teams. He then transferred to the University of Southern California (USC), where he was a first-team All-America selected by &quot;USA Today Baseball Weekly&quot;, &quot;Collegiate Baseball&quot;, and &quot;Baseball America&quot;. With a 12–3 record, a 3.28 ERA, and 154 strikeouts in innings, Zito was named Pac-10 Pitcher of the Year.

Zito also played in the Cape Cod Baseball League, a summer wooden bat league that showcases the nation&#x27;s top amateur prospects. He led the Wareham Gatemen to the league championship in 1997 and was named a league all-star and led the team to a runner-up finish in 1998.

==Professional career==
===Drafts and minor leagues===
Zito was taken by the Seattle Mariners in the 59th round (1,586th overall) of the 1996 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft, and in the third round (83rd overall) by the Texas Rangers in 1998, but did not sign with either team. In the 1999 draft, he was selected by the Oakland Athletics with the ninth pick of the first round, and signed for a $1.59 million bonus.

In 1999, Zito began his professional career with the Visalia Oaks, Oakland&#x27;s A team. He went 3–0 with a 2.45 ERA in eight starts. He struck out 62 in innings. Zito was promoted to the Midland RockHounds and went 2–1 with a 4.91 ERA to finish the AA schedule. He then got one start for the AAA Vancouver Canadians (PCL), allowing a lone run with six strikeouts in six innings.

Zito began the 2000 season in AAA with the Sacramento River Cats (the Canadians franchise had moved to Sacramento). He pitched innings in 18 starts, going 8–5 with a 3.19 ERA, 91 strikeouts, and 41 walks.

===Oakland Athletics (2000–2006)===
====2000====
Zito made his major league debut on July 22, 2000, against the Anaheim Angels wearing #53. He allowed one run in five innings, and got the win. In his next start, Zito went seven innings while giving up three runs to the Boston Red Sox. Zito continued to have great success early in his rookie season. In his third career start, he went seven innings and gave up one run against the Toronto Blue Jays. On September 10, Zito pitched his first complete game shutout against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He threw 110 pitches, struck out eight, and allowed five hits. During September, he went 5–1 with a 1.73 ERA. Zito finished with a 7–4 record and a 2.72 earned run average in 14 starts. Despite his late start to the season, Zito still received a vote for the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award voting, finishing in a 4-way tie for sixth place with Steve Cox, Adam Kennedy and Mark Redman.

Zito made his postseason debut in Game 4 of the AL Division Series (ALDS) against the New York Yankees. He went innings, struck out 5, walked 2, and allowed an earned run. Zito earned the win, outpitching Roger Clemens. However, the Yankees would win the series, 3–2, and would go on to win their third straight World Series.

====2001====
In 2001, Zito Switched his uniform number to 75 (which he would wear throughout the rest of his career) and finished third in the American League (AL) in strikeouts per nine innings (8.61), fourth in strikeouts (205), sixth in wins (17), eighth in ERA (3.49), and tenth in winning percentage (.680). Zito became the sixth lefty aged 23 or younger since 1902 to strike out at least 200 batters in a season. After a great rookie season, Zito struggled through the early part of the 2001 season, posting a 6–7 record with a 5.01 ERA in his first 22 starts. However, he rebounded nicely and by August, he was putting up good pitching numbers. Zito was named Pitcher of the Month in August, going 5–1 with a 1.02 ERA. Zito won Pitcher of the Month again in September, going 6–0 with a 1.89 ERA. During those last two months of the season, Zito went a combined 11–1 with a 1.32 ERA, best in baseball.

The Athletics made the postseason and again played the Yankees in the ALDS. Zito pitched in Game 3 against Mike Mussina. He went eight innings, striking out six, walking one, and allowing an earned run. But Zito took the loss as the Yankees won the game, 1–0. The Yankees would end up taking the series, 3–2.

====2002====
In 2002, Zito became one of the best pitchers in baseball. On May 8, Zito signed a 4-year, $9.3 million contract extension, keeping him in Oakland through at least the 2005 season, with a club option for the 2006 season. On June 22, Zito won his 10th game of the season. It was the earliest that an A&#x27;s pitcher had reached the 10-win mark since Bob Welch got there on June 15, 1990. Zito was named to the All-Star team for the first time in his career. On July 18, he went innings while giving up no runs against the Angels. That win gave Zito a team-record 16th straight win at home. Zito again faced the Angels in his next start and produced similar results. He went innings and gave up just one run. That win gave Zito the most wins by an AL pitcher (14). Zito would become the AL&#x27;s first 15-game winner when he beat the Rangers. On August 23, Zito recorded his 18th win of the season, giving him one more than his previous career-high of 17, in a game against the Detroit Tigers.

On August 28, Zito earned his 19th win of the season against the Kansas City Royals. However, he lost his bid for a perfect game in the sixth inning when Neifi Pérez singled with one out. Zito gave credit to Pérez. &quot;I wasn&#x27;t pitching to maintain a no-hitter or something&quot;, Zito said. &quot;I left the ball up over the middle to Pérez, and he hit it up the middle. It was a good piece of hitting.&quot;

On September 8, Zito became the first pitcher in the AL to win 20 games when he pitched seven innings and allowed no earned runs against the Minnesota Twins. &quot;I&#x27;m not pitching for the Cy Young&quot;, Zito said. &quot;I&#x27;m pitching to get the Oakland A&#x27;s into the playoffs and to the World Series.&quot; In his next start, against the Seattle Mariners, Zito took a no-hitter into the eighth inning before John Olerud singled to leadoff the inning. Seattle manager Lou Piniella said if he could vote for the Cy Young Award winner, &quot;It would go to that young man who pitched for the Oakland team. There are other deserving pitchers, but [Zito] has won 21 games and he competes well.&quot;

In his last start of the season, Zito went six innings and allowed just a run against the Texas Rangers. In his last 10 starts, Zito went 8–0, boosting his chances of winning the AL Cy Young Award. &quot;Barry pitched another gem&quot;, said Oakland manager Art Howe. &quot;He&#x27;s certainly had a Cy Young-type season. He&#x27;s just been steady all season long.&quot; Zito was a part of the A&#x27;s 20 consecutive game winning streak in 2002.

In Game 3 of the ALDS, Zito went six innings and gave up three earned runs against the Twins, earning the win. However, the Twins defeated the Athletics in five games, making the Athletics the first team to lose the deciding game of a series three years in a row.

Zito won the AL Cy Young Award with a 23–5 record, narrowly defeating Pedro Martínez in the voting. He led the league with 23 wins, was second in winning percentage (.821), and third in both ERA (2.75) and strikeouts (182). Zito&#x27;s 23 wins were the most by an AL left-hander since Frank Viola had 24 wins for Minnesota in 1988. Zito also allowed a .185 average to opposing hitters, the lowest in the AL. Martínez, who had led the AL in ERA (2.26), strikeouts (239), and winning percentage (.833), became the first pitcher since the introduction of the award to lead his league in each of the three categories and not win the award. Zito became the first A&#x27;s pitcher to win the Cy Young Award since Dennis Eckersley did it in 1992. Zito was also named AL TSN Pitcher of the Year.

====2003====
In 2003, Zito started with a win against the Mariners. He went 6 innings and allowed an earned run, an RBI single by Olerud in the first inning. In his next start, Zito went 7 innings, struck out 7, walked 4, and allowed one run against Texas. He became only the fifth A&#x27;s pitcher to win 10 straight games, the first since Welch in 1990. On April 18, Zito went nine innings, allowing six hits and no runs in a start against the Rangers. Zito improved to 9–0 in his career against Texas. After the game, Texas manager Buck Showalter said, &quot;I got the feeling he made it look pretty easy. When he has that kind of command, you can see what happens.&quot; Zito struggled in his second-to-last start before the All-Star Break on July 8. He allowed seven earned runs and 15 hits against the Devil Rays. The 15 hits allowed were a career-high. Devil Rays manager Piniella was stunned by Zito&#x27;s bad start. He said, &quot;If you&#x27;d have told me we&#x27;d get 15 hits off Zito in five or six innings, I would have looked at you a little funny.&quot; Nevertheless, Zito bounced back in his next start. He went eight innings without surrendering a run against the Baltimore Orioles. Zito was again named to the All-Star team, the second time he has been named to the team.

In 2003, Zito was seventh in the AL in ERA (3.30). He had a 14–12 record and 146 strikeouts over a career-high innings pitched.

In Game 2 of the ALDS against the Red Sox, Zito went seven innings, striking out nine, walking two, allowing one earned run, and earning the win in Oakland&#x27;s 5–1 triumph. In Game 5, Zito went six innings and allowed four earned runs, taking the loss as the Red Sox won the game and the series.

====2004====
In 2004, Zito struggled and posted the worst numbers of his career at the time. Zito went 2–3 with a 6.83 ERA in April. On May 28, facing Cliff Lee, he threw eight shutout innings but received a no-decision in a 1–0 loss to the Cleveland Indians. He threw eight shutout innings of four-hit ball in a 5–0 victory over the Devil Rays on August 21. Oakland manager Ken Macha would have let him throw a complete game, but Zito said, &quot;I was worrying about being fresh for the next game. I didn&#x27;t want to end up [throwing] 115–120 [pitches], so I took advantage of the situation and shut it down.&quot; On September 12, he threw seven shutout innings and had 10 strikeouts, earning the win in a 1–0 victory over the Indians. For the season, he went 11–11 with a 4.48 ERA. That was his only year with the Athletics that his ERA was more than 4.00. He still finished 10th in the league in strikeouts with 163.

====2005====

Following the departure of Tim Hudson and Mark Mulder, Zito was given his first Opening Day assignment in 2005. He allowed four runs over six innings in a 4–0 loss to the Orioles on April 4. In 2005, Zito again struggled in April, going 0–4 with a 6.60 ERA. In his first 16 starts of the campaign, he was 3–8 with a 4.41 ERA. However, Zito pitched better the rest of the season. He had a streak of 14 consecutive starts from May 17 through July 25 (and 20 out of 21 through August 30) in which he gave up fewer hits than innings pitched. From June 28 through August 4, he earned the win in eight consecutive starts. On June 6, Zito allowed two runs in six innings in a 2–1 loss to the Washington Nationals. During the game, he collected his first major league hit, against Tony Armas Jr. Zito was named Pitcher of the Month in July, going 6–0 with a 2.51 ERA. In 35 starts, Zito went 14–13 with a 3.86 ERA. Zito&#x27;s 35 starts were the most in Major League Baseball that season, demonstrating his durability as a pitcher. He also had 171 strikeouts, good for fifth in the league.

====2006====
In 2006, Zito went innings and allowed seven earned runs on Opening Day (April 3) against the Yankees. It was the shortest outing of his career. However, Zito quickly rebounded from that bad start. On June 1, he allowed four hits over seven innings in a 4–0 victory over the Twins. During the game, he recorded his 1,000th career strikeout by punching out Lew Ford. On July 2, Zito and Brandon Webb both allowed one run through eight innings before Zito gave up two unearned runs while only getting two outs in the ninth; Webb threw a complete game as the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Athletics 3–1. When the All-Star Break rolled around, Zito was 8–6 with a 3.29 earned run average. He was named to the 2006 All-Star Game. On August 25, Zito earned his 100th career win when he defeated the Rangers 9–3. He had a no-hitter going into the eighth inning, but Mark DeRosa singled to lead it off. In 35 starts (first in the league again), he had a 16–10 record, a 3.83 ERA, and 151 strikeouts. Zito was tied for eighth in the league in wins, he ranked tenth in ERA, and he was third in innings pitched (221). He had the eighth-lowest run support of AL pitchers (4.97) but had a 15–1 record if he received at least two runs of support.

Zito helped the Athletics reach the postseason. In Game 1 of the ALDS, he allowed one run and four hits over eight innings, outdueling Johan Santana and earning the win in a 3–2 victory over the Twins and setting the stage for an Oakland sweep. Zito did not fare as well in Game 1 of the AL Championship Series (ALCS) against the Tigers, allowing five runs over innings in a 5–1 defeat. The Tigers went on to sweep the Athletics in four games.

Zito replaced his agent Arn Tellem with Scott Boras in July 2006. Zito was a focal point of the 2006 trade deadline, and was widely rumored to be headed to the Mets in a potential deal for prospect Lastings Milledge. Susan Slusser of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote that if the Mets were unwilling to trade Milledge, the Athletics might be interested in Aaron Heilman and John Maine. However, Athletics&#x27; general manager Billy Beane decided to keep Zito for the rest of the season.

===San Francisco Giants (2007–2013)===
====2007====

Following his seventh season with the Athletics, Zito signed a seven-year deal with the San Francisco Giants worth $126 million, plus an $18 million option for 2014 with a $7 million buyout. Zito&#x27;s contract on December 29, 2006, became the highest for any pitcher in Major League history at the time.

During spring training in 2007, he and Barry Bonds made shirts that read &quot;Don&#x27;t ask me, ask Barry&quot; with an arrow pointing to the other Barry. By all accounts, Zito and Bonds got along well during their short time as teammates, and Zito made a point of saying he would stand by Bonds through onslaughts from the media.

In his first start as a member of the Giants, Opening Day (April 3), Zito went five innings and allowed two earned runs against the San Diego Padres. He would take the loss. In his next start, Zito struggled. He went six innings but allowed eight earned runs against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Zito would earn his first win as a member of the Giants in his next start on April 16 when he went six innings, gave up three hits, and allowed no runs to the Colorado Rockies. &quot;I&#x27;ve been trying to have a good game&quot;, Zito said. &quot;You can&#x27;t try to do anything. You either do or you don&#x27;t. I tried to get too fine with my pitches. I wasn&#x27;t aggressive.&quot;

On May 18, Zito made his return to Oakland as a Giant. He lasted only four innings and gave up seven runs while walking seven, including two bases-loaded walks. The A&#x27;s beat the Giants, 15–3.&lt;ref name=&quot;5/18/07-recap&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He faced his old team again on June 9, this time in San Francisco. Zito pitched four innings while giving up three earned runs on nine hits in a 6–0 defeat.&lt;ref name=&quot;6/09/07-recap&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Zito made his first Major League relief appearance on August 5 against the Padres due to an early exit by starter Noah Lowry and an overworked bullpen. He pitched a scoreless seventh inning.&lt;ref name=&quot;8/05/07-recap&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He recorded his first career run batted in (RBI) two days later against the Nationals&#x27; Mike Bacsik, in the same game that Barry Bonds hit his record-breaking 756th career home run.&lt;ref name=&quot;8/07/07-recap&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After Zito&#x27;s start on August 12, his ERA was 5.13. Over his final nine starts, he posted the fifth-best ERA in the NL, at 3.10. He also had a 3–2 record. He admitted that he had put pressure on himself to perform because of the large contract and was learning that he just needed to be himself. Zito also said that it had been difficult for him to adjust to a new league, team, and ballpark. On the final day of the season, in Los Angeles against the Dodgers, Zito allowed two runs on five hits and had four strikeouts in an 11–2 win. For the first time in his career, Zito had a losing record, as he finished the season at 11–13. He failed to reach 200 innings () for the first time since 2000 and posted a career-high 4.53 ERA.

====2008====
Zito began the 2008 season as the oldest starter and the veteran presence in the Giants&#x27; starting rotation. In April, Zito went 0–6 with a 7.53 ERA and 11 strikeouts. He was the third pitcher in the last 52 years to go 0–6 before May 1. On April 28, the Giants moved him to the bullpen. Zito did not make an appearance out of the bullpen and returned to the rotation on May 7 against the Pittsburgh Pirates. In that game, Zito allowed five hits and two earned runs over five innings and took the loss, his seventh of the season. On May 23, Zito collected his first win of the 2008 season against the Florida Marlins. On June 13, Zito became the first pitcher to record 10 losses in the Major Leagues following a 5–1 loss to Oakland. His 5.1 walks per nine innings pitched for the season, 51.5% first-pitch-strike percentage, and 14 sacrifice flies allowed, were all the worst in the majors. Beginning June 25, Zito saw some improvement, as he posted an 8–6 record for the rest of the season to go along with a 4.33 ERA. He finished the year 10–17 with a career-high 5.15 ERA and 120 strikeouts. His 17 losses led the National League and were the second-worst total in San Francisco history (Ray Sadecki lost 18 games in 1968).

====2009====
The 2009 season seemed to mark a rebound in Zito&#x27;s pitching performance. Though starting the season 0–2 with an ERA of 10, Zito ended the season with an ERA of 4.03. His ERA would have been 3.74 had it not been for his first two starts. Though going only 10–13 in the season, Zito&#x27;s record was much more the fault of his spotty run support (the second-lowest in the major leagues) than his performance on the mound. On June 21, Zito pitched a no-hitter through six innings against Texas before giving up a home run to Andruw Jones in the seventh inning. He won the game, his fourth win of the season. On July 7, Zito pitched what could be considered his best game of the season. He pitched 8 innings against the Florida Marlins, allowing one run on four hits, striking out six, and walking one. He won the game, his fifth win of the season.

====2010====
Zito started the 2010 season by pitching six shutout innings against the Houston Astros to earn a win; it was the first time he had won his season-opening start since 2003. On April 24, Zito stifled the St. Louis Cardinals, throwing eight shutout innings with ten strikeouts for his third victory of the season, en route to starting the season 5–0 for the first time in his career. It was the best start by a Giants&#x27; pitcher since 2004 when Lowry started 6–0. On June 12, 2010, Zito earned his first win against his former team, the Athletics, which gave him victories against every MLB team. Zito is one of eighteen pitchers to record a win against all 30 MLB teams, and the first pitcher to accomplish the feat while only with two clubs.

Through June 12, Zito was 7–2 with a 3.10 ERA. After a strong start to the season, Zito regressed down the stretch, going 2–12 with a 4.97 ERA the rest of the way. He finished the season 9–14 with a 4.15 ERA, snapping a streak of nine straight seasons in which he had 10 or more wins. In a rotation featuring Tim Lincecum, Matt Cain, Jonathan Sánchez, and Madison Bumgarner, Zito was the odd man out for the playoffs. He was left completely off the Giants&#x27; 25-man active roster for the postseason. Zito worked out throughout the playoffs so that he would be ready to join the roster in case of an injury, but he was never needed and remained on the secondary squad. The Giants won the 2010 World Series in five games over Texas, and he received his first World Series ring.

====2011====
Early in the 2011 season, Zito experienced his first trip to the disabled list after an injury to his right foot during a fielding play. His replacement, Ryan Vogelsong, excelled, but Zito was able to rejoin the rotation when he returned in June because Sánchez was placed on the disabled list with left biceps tendinitis. Zito pitched well in his first few starts back, pitching well against the Tigers, Chicago Cubs, and Padres en route to three Giants wins, but later resumed his struggle, going 0–3 with a 10.91 ERA over his next three starts. He returned to the disabled list after aggravating his right foot injury; ironically, his trip to the DL made room for Sánchez to return to the rotation. On August 13, Zito injured his right ankle on another fielding play in a Triple-A rehab start, sidelining him for another month. Zito returned from the DL on September 11 but was used out of the bullpen for the rest of the year; he posted a 9.00 ERA over his final four games. In a career-low 13 games (nine starts), he had a 3–4 record, a career-high 5.87 ERA, 32 strikeouts, and 24 walks in a career-low innings.

====2012====
After struggling mightily during spring training in which he threw with a new crouched delivery, Zito began the 2012 season with a start against the Rockies on April 9. He threw arguably one of the best games of his career, throwing a complete-game shutout while giving up just 4 hits in the 7–0 Giants victory. It was his first shutout since 2003 when he was a member of the Oakland Athletics. In a June 3 home game matchup with the Cubs, Zito pitched four-hit shutout ball into the ninth inning for a 2–0 Giants win and brought his season ERA below 3.00. In earning the win, Zito earned his 150th career win, becoming the 246th pitcher to hit the mark. Zito had a hand in the Giants&#x27; second road shutout win of the season when he pitched seven innings, allowing three hits and recording four strikeouts, in a July 17 game versus the Atlanta Braves. The win pushed his season record to 8–6. Zito would go on to finish the season with a 15–8 record, his most wins in a season with the Giants, while sporting a 4.15 ERA.

Zito faced off against the Reds in Game 4 of the National League Division Series (NLDS) on October 10 and struggled, being pulled in the third inning after allowing two runs. However, the Giants went on to win 8–3. The Giants, after losing the first two games of the series, became the first team to rally from a 2–0 deficit with both losses at home in an NLDS, winning 3 straight road games to win the series in five games. On October 19, 2012, Zito rebounded and pitched arguably the best game of his career, tossing 7 shutout innings against the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 5 of the National League Championship Series (NLCS), earning the win. It was his first postseason win since 2006 and according to Zito himself, was the biggest win of his career. That same day, Zito inspired the Twitter hashtag &quot;#rallyzito&quot;, which, behind the efforts of Giants fans, was trending worldwide on the social networking site. The Giants, after trailing 3–1 in the series, prevailed in seven games.

On October 24, 2012, Zito pitched in the first World Series of his career. As the Game 1 starter, Zito earned the win, outpitching Detroit&#x27;s Justin Verlander by tossing innings of one-run ball. Zito added an RBI single en route to an 8–3 Giants win. The Giants went on to sweep the Tigers in the World Series, and Zito went 2–0 with a 1.69 earned run average in the postseason.
Zito did not lose a single game after August 2 against the Mets, and San Francisco won his last 14 starts.

====2013====
On April 5, 2013, during the Giants&#x27; home opener, Zito held the Cardinals scoreless over seven shutout innings, earning the 1–0 win. He followed this performance with seven more shutout innings and some personal offensive contribution at the plate against the Rockies in a 10–0 win to complete a 3-game series sweep. It was the Giants&#x27; 16th straight victory in a row in games started by Zito (including the 2012 regular season and postseason), the longest such streak by a Giants pitcher since 1936 by Hall of Fame left-handed pitcher Carl Hubbell. However, Zito struggled for the rest of the season, going 2–10 with a 6.24 ERA after April 21 and losing his rotation spot a couple times late in the year.

On September 25, manager Bruce Bochy decided to give Zito one final start with the Giants as a tribute to his tenure with the team. Zito responded by allowing two runs (one earned) over five innings and earning the win in a 7–4 victory over the Dodgers. However, because Zito was removed between innings during the Dodger game, Bochy sent him in to pitch in relief in the final game of the year so that Giants&#x27; fans could give him a standing ovation. Zito entered with two outs in the eighth inning on September 29 and struck out Mark Kotsay (playing his final game) as the Giants beat the Padres 7–6. He finished the 2013 season at 5–11 with a 5.74 ERA in 30 games, 25 of which were starts. Following the season, Zito took out a full-page ad in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; thanking Giants fans for their support. The Giants declined Zito&#x27;s 2014 option, buying it out for $7 million.

===Second stint with the Athletics (2015)===

After taking a year off from baseball, Zito signed a minor league contract to return to the Athletics on February 16, 2015. In spring training, Zito competed for a role on the Athletics&#x27; 25-man roster, possibly as a long reliever. On April 4, 2015, Zito accepted an assignment to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds. Zito&#x27;s Nashville teammates lauded him for embracing the Triple-A lifestyle and for his commitment to the team: charting pitches between starts, coaching first base, and even buying dinner for the entire team on his birthday. Zito spent the entire season with Nashville, including about a month on the disabled list with left shoulder tendinitis. He was activated on the next-to-last day of the season on which he pitched one scoreless inning of relief. In 24 appearances (22 starts), he accrued an 8–7 record with a 3.46 ERA and 91 strikeouts.

Zito revealed in an interview that he had learned the Athletics would not be bringing him up to the major league club in September. However, following a season-ending injury to Jesse Chavez, Oakland purchased Zito&#x27;s contract from Triple-A on September 16, placing him on the major league roster. Zito made his first major league appearance of the season on September 20, pitching an inning in relief. On September 26, 2015, Zito started for the Athletics against Hudson and the Giants in a matchup that was arranged as a tribute to the A&#x27;s &quot;Big Three&quot; of the early 2000s. Both pitchers received lengthy standing ovations from the sold-out Coliseum crowd (which included the third Big Three member, Mulder) upon leaving the game.

On October 19, 2015, Zito announced his retirement from baseball in an article for &quot;The Players&#x27; Tribune&quot;.

==Pitching style==

Zito&#x27;s fastball hovered between and . He augmented it with a circle changeup and a curveball that he used as a strikeout pitch. His curveball was voted the best in the Major Leagues in a player poll conducted by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in 2005. Alex Rodriguez once stated that he had never seen anything like Zito&#x27;s curveball, commenting: &quot;It&#x27;s such a high one, and it drops three to four feet. You might as well not even look for it because you&#x27;re not going to hit it.&quot;

In mid-2004, Zito added a two-seam fastball and a cutter–slider hybrid to his arsenal. In the 2009 season, this cutter-slider became a prominent part of his repertoire, being used more frequently than his changeup. Zito&#x27;s diminished velocity at the start of the 2007 season (his fastball velocity slowed to ) and loss of command were the key mechanical reasons for his struggles that year, as he more often got behind in the count and had to rely more on his fastball. During the 2009 season, Zito made changes to his delivery, lowering his arm slot from an over the top angle to a three-quarters delivery. This change helped his fastball velocity go back up to the range as well as sharpening the break of his curveball. However, in 2011, he was once again in the range with his fastball. In 2012, Zito relied mostly on his two-seam fastball and cutter and reduced his reliance on the four-seamer, which was the slowest four-seamer in MLB among starting pitchers that year, at .

Addressing his finesse pitching style, Zito said, &quot;My fastball is set up by my offspeed, that&#x27;s no secret. So if I can command my fastball to both sides of the plate and throw most of my offspeed for strikes, I&#x27;ll get them to miss the barrel. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going for.&quot;

==Legacy==
From 2000 through 2004 with the Athletics, Zito, Hudson, and Mulder were known as the &quot;Big Three.&quot; Of the three, Zito had the highest single-season win total and was the only one to win the Cy Young Award. Zito&#x27;s .618 winning percentage is 10th all-time in Athletics history. His 6.896 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched ranks seventh, his 1,096 strikeouts rank eighth, and his 222 games started rank 10th. Zito also holds a couple more dubious positions on Oakland&#x27;s list: his 148 home runs allowed rank fifth, and his 65 hit by pitches rank fourth (although he trails Eddie Plank, Chief Bender, and Rube Waddell in that category). Zito&#x27;s .821 winning percentage in 2002 is tied with Bender&#x27;s in 1910 for 10th among Athletics&#x27; single-season totals. His 8.608 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched in 2001 rank seventh, and his 205 strikeouts in 2001 are tied for 10th (with Dave Stewart&#x27;s 1987 total and Todd Stottlemyre&#x27;s 1995 total).

Zito&#x27;s regular-season performance with the Giants was less successful; he went 63–80 with a 4.62 ERA. However, he had significantly more playoff success with them. Aided by his contributions in 2010, the team won its first World Series since 1954. Zito did not pitch in the playoffs that year, but did pitch in the 2012 postseason, saving the Giants&#x27; season by pitching them to a Game 5 victory in the NLCS against the Cardinals and then outdueling Tigers&#x27; ace Justin Verlander in Game 1 of the 2012 World Series. The Giants went on to win their second World Series in three years.

As a hitter, Zito batted .102 with 11 RBI. His 35 career hits were all singles, putting him 2nd on the all-time list of most plate appearances (418) without an extra-base hit.

==Music career==
Zito started playing guitar in 1999 to pass the time on road trips. He had not considered music as a profession until his sister, Sally Zito, asked him to play guitar in her band which he played with during the offseason from 2000 to 2007. He began writing songs in preparation for a career after baseball. His 2015 comeback bid found him playing the majority of the season in Nashville, Tennessee, the home of country music. He used his time off to learn from the city&#x27;s music industry professionals and to pursue songwriting. Zito released his first EP, titled &quot;No Secrets&quot;, on January 27, 2017. The collection contains six songs either written or co-written by Zito. He later co-wrote and sang vocals for a theme song for the Nashville Sounds, titled &quot;That Sound&quot;.

In 2020, Zito competed in season three of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Rhino&quot;.

On September 26, 2024, Zito sang The Star Spangled Banner before the start of the Oakland Athletics final home game.

==Personal life==

Zito became engaged to former Miss Missouri Teen USA and former Miss Missouri USA Amber Seyer in April 2011, and they were married on December 3, 2011. His father, Joe Zito, who died June 19, 2013, at the age of 84, composed and arranged music for Nat King Cole in the early 1960s (ca.1961–64) and arranged for the Buffalo Symphony Orchestra. Zito&#x27;s mother Roberta was a musician who sang in a choral group known as The Merry Young Souls and with Nat King Cole and his band. Zito is also a musician. He plays guitar, and he co-wrote the song &quot;Butterflies&quot; that was used in the Eddie Murphy film &quot;A Thousand Words&quot;. Zito&#x27;s maternal aunt was married to television actor Patrick Duffy.

Zito and wife Amber gave birth to their first child, a son named Mars, in July 2014. They adopted their second child, a son named Mercer Joseph Zito, in May 2017. A third child, a son named Rome, was born in February 2020. A fourth son, Rockwell, was born in September 2024. 

Zito is known for his idiosyncrasies and his offbeat personality. Early in his career, Zito dyed his hair blue. He earned the nicknames &quot;Planet Zito&quot; and &quot;Captain Quirk&quot; when with Oakland. Zito says he likes the way his uniform number 75 looks because the 7 and the 5 are like a &quot;shelf&quot; to hold the name &quot;Zito&quot; up. He surfs and practices yoga. He has done yoga poses in the outfield, and meditated before games. Zito practices Transcendental Meditation and supports the David Lynch Foundation. Zito has said, however, that he believes terms such as &quot;flaky&quot; or &quot;hippie&quot; have been applied to him by people who do not know him well enough to know better.

Zito was raised in a &quot;spiritual, metaphysical type church&quot; that was founded by his grandmother and that his mother, Roberta, who died in 2008, formerly preached at. In 2001, Zito espoused a universal life force that he credited with his midseason turnaround. He said that he discovered this force by reading &quot;Creative Mind&quot; by Ernest Holmes.

However, in August 2011, Zito became a Christian, saying he &quot;committed to Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior.&quot; Zito explained that God got his attention through his being left off the 2010 Giants postseason roster and a car accident and freak foot injury in early 2011. He got a tattoo (his only one) of a golden calf on the inside of his right bicep as a reminder for him to &quot;not worship false idols&quot; and to remember that God comes first. Zito said that his wife is a Christian as well. In 2019, Zito wrote &quot;Curveball: How I Discovered True Fulfillment After Chasing Fortune and Fame&quot;, a memoir book about his life and his conversion to Christianity. Zito has said, “Having placed my full identity into my baseball career for most of my life, only to have it stripped away during the 2010 World Series run is what led me to discover my true identity. Not in a game, but in Jesus Christ.”

In 2003, Zito portrayed a United States Navy petty officer in an episode of &quot;JAG&quot; on CBS. Zito&#x27;s character, a pitcher, faced assault charges after hitting a Marine with a ball during the annual Navy-Marine all-star baseball game.

==Activism==
===Philanthropy===
Zito founded the charity &quot;Strikeouts For Troops&quot;. The charity provides the comforts of home and works to lift the spirits and morale of injured US troops and offers support to military families. In 2010, Zito announced that he would donate $1,500 for every strikeout in the Giants–Padres game on September 11. There were a total of 14 strikeouts in the game.

<doc id="145550" wikidata="Q20726474" url="?curid=145550" title="Flechette">
<text>A flechette or flèchette ( ) is a pointed, fin-stabilized steel projectile. The name comes from French (from \&quot;&quot;), meaning &quot;little arrow&quot; or &quot;dart&quot;, and sometimes retains the grave accent in English: flèchette. They have been used as ballistic weapons since World War I. Delivery systems and methods of launching flechettes vary, from a single shot, to thousands in a single explosive round. The use of flechettes as antipersonnel weapons has been controversial; however in war is not prohibited by the Geneva Convention.

==Air-dropped==

The weapons were designed to be dropped from an aircraft. They contained no explosive charge but as they fell they developed significant kinetic energy making them lethal and able to easily penetrate soft cover such as jungle canopy, several inches of sand or light armor.

During World War I, flechettes were dropped from aircraft to attack infantry and were able to pierce helmets.

Also during World War II, a version of the flechette with feathers was dropped, and now resides in the Imperial War Museum.
Later the U.S. used Lazy Dog bombs, which are small, unguided kinetic projectiles typically about in length, in diameter, and weighing about . Lazy Dog munitions were simple and cheap; they could be dropped in huge numbers in a pass. Though their effects were often no less indiscriminate than other projectiles, they did not leave unexploded ordnance (UXO) that could be active years after a conflict ended. Lazy Dog projectiles were used primarily during the Korean and Vietnam Wars.

==Small-arms ammunition==

The excellent ballistic performance and armor-piercing potential of flechettes have made the development and integration of this class of munition attractive to small-arms manufacturers. A number of attempts have been made to field flechette-firing small arms.

Work at Johns Hopkins University in the 1950s led to the development of the direct injection antipersonnel chemical biological agent (DIACBA), where flechettes were grooved, hollow pointed, or otherwise milled to retain a quantity of chemical or biological warfare agent to be delivered through a ballistic wound. The initial work was with the nerve agent VX, which had to be thickened to deliver a reliable dose. Eventually this was replaced by a particulate carbamate. The US Biological Program also had a microflechette to deliver either botulinum toxin A or saxitoxin, the M1 biodart, which resembled a 7.62 mm rifle cartridge. The USSR had the AO-27 rifle as well as the APS amphibious rifle, and other countries have their own flechette rounds.

A number of prototype flechette-firing weapons were developed as part of the long-running Special Purpose Individual Weapon (SPIW) project. The Steyr-Mannlicher ACR rifle was a prototype flechette-firing assault rifle built for the US Army&#x27;s Advanced Combat Rifle program of 1989–90.

A variation of the flechette addressing its difficulties is the SCMITR, developed as part of the Close Assault Weapon System, or CAWS, project. Selective-fire shotguns were used to fire flechettes designed to retain the exterior ballistics and penetration of standard flechettes, but increase wounding capacity through a wider wound path.

===Shotguns===
During the Vietnam War the United States employed 12-gauge combat shotguns using flechette loads. These plastic-cased shells were issued on a limited trial basis during the Vietnam War. Cartridges manufactured by the Western Cartridge Company contained 20 flechettes, each long and weighing ; Federal Cartridge Company rounds contained 25. The flechettes were packed in a plastic cup with granulated white polyethylene to maintain alignment with the bore axis, and supported by a metal disk to prevent penetration of the over-powder wad during acceleration down the bore. The tips of the flechettes were exposed in the Federal cartridges, but concealed by a conventional star crimp in WCC&#x27;s cartridges. The flechettes demonstrated flatter trajectories over longer ranges than spherical buckshot, but combat effectiveness did not justify continued production.

==Rocket and artillery use==
Smaller flechettes were used in special artillery shells called &quot;beehive&quot; rounds (so named for the very distinctive whistling buzz made by thousands of flechettes flying downrange at supersonic speeds) and intended for use against troops in the open – a ballistic shell packed with flechettes was fired and set off by a mechanical time fuse, scattering flechettes in an expanding cone.

During the Vietnam War 105 mm howitzer batteries and tanks (90 mm guns) used flechette rounds to defend themselves against massed infantry attacks. The ubiquitous 105 mm M40 recoilless rifle was primarily used as an anti-tank weapon. However, it could also be used in an anti-personnel role with the use of flechette rounds. The widely used Carl Gustaf 8.4 cm recoilless rifle also uses an Area Defence Munition designed as a close-range anti-personnel round. It fires 1,100 flechettes over a wide area. The US Air Force used rockets with WDU-4/A flechette warheads.

The 70 mm Hydra 70 rocket currently in service with the US Armed forces can be fitted with an anti-personnel (APERS) warhead containing 1,179 flechettes. They are carried by attack helicopters such as the AH-64 Apache and the AH-1 Cobra.

===Israel-Palestine conflict===
Israeli authorities have reportedly used flechettes in Gaza since at least 2001. In 2001, Israeli officials stated that &quot;The Israeli military obtained these weapons from the USA after the 1973 war and we have thousands of old shells in warehouses.&quot; 

=== Russo-Ukrainian war ===

Flechettes have been used during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, where samples of the projectiles were recovered in the mass graves in Bucha. A witness described munitions bursting overhead and littering the area with 3 cm flechettes. A British munitions expert reviewed photographs of the flechettes and concluded that they likely came from a 122 mm 3Sh1 artillery round. A speaker for the Ukrainian Ground Forces stated that Ukraine&#x27;s military does not use shells with flechettes.

<doc id="145551" wikidata="Q15912661" url="?curid=145551" title="Racial policy of Nazi Germany">
<text>The racial policy of Nazi Germany was a set of policies and laws implemented in Nazi Germany under the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler, based on pseudoscientific and racist doctrines asserting the superiority of the putative &quot;Aryan race&quot;, which claimed scientific legitimacy. This was combined with a eugenics program that aimed for &quot;racial hygiene&quot; by compulsory sterilization and extermination of those who they saw as &quot;Untermenschen&quot; (&quot;sub-humans&quot;), which culminated in the Holocaust.

Nazi policies labeled centuries-long residents in German territory who were not ethnic Germans such as Jews (which in Nazi racial theory were emphasized as a Semitic people of Levantine origins), Romani (an Indo-Aryan people originating from the Indian subcontinent, historically colloquially referred to derogatorily as &quot;Gypsies&quot;), along with the vast majority of Slavs (mainly ethnic Poles, Serbs, Ukrainians, Russians, Belarusians, etc.), and most non-Europeans as inferior non-Aryan subhumans (under the Nazi appropriation of the term &quot;Aryan&quot;) in a racial hierarchy that placed the &quot;Herrenvolk&quot; (&quot;master race&quot;) of the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; (&quot;people&#x27;s community&quot;) at the top.

The racial policy of the Nazi Party and the German state was organized through the Office of Racial Policy, which published circulars and directives to relevant administrative organs, newspapers, and educational institutes.

==Historical origins of Nazi racial theories and policies==
Adolf Hitler himself along with other members of the Nazi Party in the Weimar Republic (1918–1933) were greatly influenced by several 19th- and early 20th-century thinkers and proponents of philosophical, onto-epistemic, and theoretical perspectives on ecological anthropology, scientific racism, holistic science, and organicism regarding the constitution of complex systems and the theorization of organic-racial societies. In particular, one of the most significant ideological influences on the Nazis was the 19th-century German nationalist philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte, whose works had served as an inspiration to Hitler and other Nazi Party members, and whose ideas were implemented among the philosophical and ideological foundations of Nazi-oriented Völkisch nationalism.

==Basis of Nazi policies and the constitution of the Aryan Master Race==

The Aryan master race conceived by Adolf Hitler and the other Nazis graded humans on a scale of pure Aryans to non-Aryans (who were viewed as subhumans). At the top of the scale of pure Aryans were Nordic-type Germans and other Nordic-Aryan Germanic and Northern European peoples, including the Dutch, Scandinavians, and the English. Latins were held to be somewhat inferior, but were tolerated; and the French were thought to have a suitable admixture of Germanic blood.

The feeling that Germans were the Aryan &quot;Herrenvolk&quot; (Aryan master race) was widely spread among the German public through Nazi propaganda and among Nazi officials throughout the ranks, in particular when the Reichskommissar of Ukraine Erich Koch said:

The Nazis considered the Slavs as Non-Aryan &quot;Untermenschen&quot; (&quot;sub-humans&quot;) who were to be enslaved and exterminated by Germans. In countries where these people lived, there were according to Nazis small groups of non-Slavic German descendants. These people underwent a &quot;racial selection&quot; process to determine whether or not they were &quot;racially valuable&quot;, if the individual passed they would be re-Germanised and forcefully taken from their families in order to be raised as Germans. This secret plan Generalplan Ost (&quot;Master Plan East&quot;) aimed at expulsion, enslavement and extermination of most Slavic people. Nazi policy towards them changed during World War II as a pragmatic means to resolve military manpower shortages: they were allowed, with certain restrictions, to serve in the Waffen-SS, in spite of being considered subhumans. Nazi propaganda portrayed people in Eastern Europe with an Asiatic appearance to be the result of intermingling between the native Slavic populations and Asiatic or Mongolian races as sub-humans dominated by the Jews with the help of Bolshevism. At the bottom of the racial scale of non-Aryans were Jews, ethnic Poles, ethnic Serbs and other Slavic people, Romani, and black people. The Nazis originally sought to rid the German state of Jews and Romani by means of deportation (and later extermination), while black people were to be segregated and eventually eliminated through compulsory sterilization.

Volkisch theorists believed that Germany&#x27;s Teutonic ancestors had spread out from Germany throughout Europe. Of the Germanic tribes that spread through Europe, the theorists identified that the Burgundians, Franks, and Western Goths joined with the Gauls to make France; the Lombards moved south and joined with the Italians; the Jutes made Denmark; the Angles and Saxons made England; the Flemings made Belgium; and other tribes made the Netherlands.

Nazi racial beliefs of the superiority of an Aryan master race arose from earlier proponents of a supremacist conception of race such as the French novelist and diplomat Arthur de Gobineau, who published a four-volume work titled &quot;An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races&quot; (translated into German in 1897). Gobineau proposed that the Aryan race was superior, and urged the preservation of its cultural and racial purity. Gobineau later came to use and reserve the term Aryan only for the &quot;German race&quot; and described the Aryans as &#x27;la race germanique&#x27;. By doing so he presented a racist theory in which Aryans—that is Germans—were all that was positive. Houston Stewart Chamberlain&#x27;s work &quot;The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century&quot; (1900), one of the first to combine Social Darwinism with antisemitism, describes history as a struggle for survival between the Germanic peoples and the Jews, whom he characterized as an inferior and dangerous group. The two-volume book &quot;Foundations of Human Hereditary Teaching and Racial Hygiene&quot; (1920–21) by Eugen Fischer, Erwin Baur, and Fritz Lenz, used pseudoscientific studies to conclude that the Germans were superior to the Jews intellectually and physically, and recommended eugenics as a solution. Madison Grant&#x27;s work &quot;The Passing of the Great Race&quot; (1916) advocated Nordicism and proposed using a eugenic program to preserve the Nordic race. After reading the book, Hitler called it &quot;my Bible&quot;.

Racist author and Nordic supremacist Hans F. K. Günther, who influenced Nazi ideology, wrote in his &quot;Race Lore of German People&quot; (&quot;Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes&quot;) about the danger of &quot;Slavic blood of Eastern race&quot; mixing with the German and combined virulent nationalism with Antisemitism. Günther became an epitome of corrupt and politicized pseudo-science in post-war Germany. Among the topics of his research were attempts to prove that Jews had an unpleasant &quot;hereditary smell&quot;. While one of the most prominent Nazi writers, Günther still was not considered the most &quot;cutting edge&quot; by Nazis.

The July 1933 Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring—written by Ernst Rüdin and other theorists of &quot;racial hygiene&quot;—established &quot;Genetic Health Courts&quot; which decided on compulsory sterilization of &quot;any person suffering from a hereditary disease.&quot; These included, for the Nazis, those suffering from &quot;Congenital Mental Deficiency&quot;, schizophrenia, &quot;Manic-Depressive Insanity&quot;, &quot;Hereditary Epilepsy&quot;, &quot;Hereditary Chorea&quot; (Huntington&#x27;s), Hereditary Blindness, Hereditary Deafness, &quot;any severe hereditary deformity&quot;, as well as &quot;any person suffering from severe alcoholism&quot;. Further modifications of the law enforced sterilization of the &quot;Rhineland bastards&quot; (children of mixed German and African parentage).

The Nazi Party wanted to increase birthrates of those who were classified as racially elite. When the Party gained power in 1933, one of their first actions was to pass the Law for the Encouragement of Marriage. This law stated that all newly married couples of the Aryan race could receive a government loan. This loan was not simply paid back, rather a portion of it would be forgiven after the birth of each child. The purpose of this law was very clear and simple: to encourage newlyweds to have as many children as they could, so that the Aryan population would grow.

==Racial policies regarding the Jews, 1933–1939==
Approximately 525,000 Jews were living in Germany in 1933 (0.75% of the entire German population). Discrimination against Jews began immediately after the national seizure of power in 1933. The Nazi Party used populist antisemitic views to gain votes. Using the &quot;stab-in-the-back legend&quot;, they blamed poverty, the hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic, unemployment, and the loss of World War I and surrender by the &quot;November Criminals&quot; all on the Jews and &quot;cultural Bolsheviks&quot;, the latter considered to be in a conspiracy with the Jews. German woes were attributed to the effects of the Treaty of Versailles. In 1933, persecution of the Jews became active Nazi policy. This was at first hindered by the lack of agreement on who qualified as a Jew as opposed to an Aryan; this caused legislators to balk at an antisemitic law for its ill-defined terms. Bernhard Lösener described it as &quot;total chaos&quot;, with local authorities regarding anything from full Jewish background to Jewish blood as defining a Jew; Achim Gercke urged Jewish blood. Those of mixed descent (&quot;Mischlinge&quot;) were especially problematic in their eyes. The first antisemitic law was promulgated with no clear definition of a Jew. Finally, the criterion was set at three or four Jewish grandparents; two or one rendered a person a &quot;Mischling&quot;.

On April 1, 1933, the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses was observed throughout Germany. Only six days later, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service was passed, banning Jews from government jobs. It is notable that the proponents of this law, and the several thousand more that were to follow, most frequently explained them as necessary to prevent the infiltration of damaging, &quot;alien-type&quot; (&quot;Artfremd&quot;) hereditary traits into the German national or racial community (&quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;). These laws meant that Jews were now indirectly and directly dissuaded or banned from privileged and superior positions reserved for &quot;Aryan Germans&quot;. From then on, Jews were forced to work in more menial positions, becoming second-class citizens or to the point that they were &quot;illegally residing&quot; in Nazi Germany.

In the early years of Nazi rule, there were efforts to secure the elimination of Jews by expulsion; later, a more explicit commitment was made to extermination. On August 25, 1933, the Nazis signed the Haavara Agreement with Zionists to allow German Jews to emigrate to Palestine in exchange for a portion of their economic assets. The agreement offered a way to leave an increasingly hostile environment in Nazi Germany; by 1939, 60,000 German Jews (about 10% of the Jewish population) had emigrated there. Thereafter, Nazi policy eventually changed to one of total extermination. Nazi doctrine culminated in the Holocaust, or so-called &quot;Final Solution&quot;, which was made official at the January 1942 Wannsee Conference.

===Nuremberg Laws===


Between 1935 and 1936, persecution of the Jews increased apace while the process of &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; (lit.: &quot;standardisation&quot;, the process by which the Nazis achieved complete control over German society) was implemented. In May 1935, Jews were forbidden to join the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; (the armed forces), and in the summer of the same year, anti-Semitic propaganda appeared in shops and restaurants. The Nuremberg Laws were passed around the time of the great Nazi rallies at Nuremberg; on September 15, 1935, the &quot;Law for the Protection of German Blood and Honor&quot; was passed. At first this criminalised sexual relations and marriage only between Germans and Jews, but later the law was extended to &quot;Gypsies, Negroes and their bastard offspring&quot;; it became punishable by law as &quot;Rassenschande&quot; or racial pollution. After this, the &quot;Reich Citizenship Law&quot; was passed, and was reinforced in November by a decree; it included only people of &quot;German or related blood&quot;, which meant that all Jews were stripped of their citizenship and their official title became &quot;subjects of the state&quot;. This meant that they were deprived of basic citizens&#x27; rights, e.g. the right to vote. This removal of citizens&#x27; rights was instrumental in the process of anti-semitic persecution: the process of denaturalization allowed the Nazis to exclude—&quot;de jure&quot;—Jews from the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; (&quot;national community&quot;), thus granting judicial legitimacy to their persecution and opening the way to harsher laws and, eventually, extermination of the Jews. Philosopher Hannah Arendt pointed out this important judicial aspect of the Holocaust in &quot;The Origins of Totalitarianism&quot; (1951), where she demonstrated that to violate human rights, Nazi Germany first deprived human beings of their citizenship. Arendt underlined that in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, citizens&#x27; rights actually preceded human rights, as the latter needed the protection of a determinate state to be actually respected.

The drafting of the Nuremberg Laws has often been attributed to Hans Globke. Globke co-authored several aspects of the laws, such as the ordinance which legally required Jews with non-Jewish names to take on the additional first names Israel or Sara, along with the official legal commentary on the Reich Citizenship Law.

In 1936, Jews were banned from all professional jobs, effectively preventing them from having any influence in education, politics, higher education, and industry. There was now nothing to stop the anti-Jewish actions that spread across the German economy.

Between 1937 and 1938, new laws were implemented, and the segregation of Jews from the &quot;German Aryan&quot; population was completed. In particular, Jews were punished financially for being Jewish.

From March 1, 1938, government contracts could not be awarded to Jewish businesses. On September 30, &quot;Aryan&quot; doctors could only treat &quot;Aryan&quot; patients. Provision of medical care to Jews was already hampered because Jews were banned from being doctors.

On August 17, Jews with first names of non-Jewish origin were legally required to add &quot;Israel&quot; (males) or &quot;Sara&quot; (females) to their names, and a large letter &quot;J&quot; was to be printed on their passports on October 5. On November 15, Jewish children were banned from going to state-run schools. By April 1939, nearly all Jewish companies had either collapsed under financial pressure and declining profits, or been persuaded to sell out to the government, further reducing their rights as human beings; they were, in many ways, effectively separated from the German populace.

The increasingly totalitarian regime that Hitler imposed on Germany allowed him to control the actions of the military. On November 7, 1938, a young Polish Jew named Herschel Grynszpan attacked and shot German diplomat Ernst vom Rath in the German embassy in Paris. Grynszpan&#x27;s family, together with more than 12,000 Polish-born Jews, had been expelled by the Nazi government from Germany to Poland in the so-called &quot;Polenaktion&quot; on October 28, 1938. Joseph Goebbels ordered retaliation. On the night of November 9, the SS and SA conducted &quot;the Night of Broken Glass&quot; (&quot;Kristallnacht&quot;), in which at least 91 Jews were killed and a further 30,000 arrested and incarcerated in Nazi concentration camps. After the start of the war, and the conquest of numerous European countries, the Jewish population was put into ghettos, from which they were shipped to death camps where they were murdered.

===Jewish responses to the Nuremberg Laws===
After the promulgation of the Nuremberg Laws, the &quot;Reichsvertretung der Deutschen Juden&quot; (Representation of the German Jews) announced the following:

===Influence of American segregationist laws===
The Nazi&#x27;s had already barred Jews from having a role in Germany society as Lawyers, Civil Servants and Teachers with the 1933 Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service and led a systemic boycott of Jewish businesses (in addition to expulsion or exclusion from other professions, or the right to own stocks) before the 1935 Nuremberg Laws were proposed but were looking for a means of codifying in a legal sense the exclusion of Jews (and other &quot;non-Aryan&quot; minorities) from both citizenship of the Reich, and therefore strip fundamental protections from the population.

James Q. Whitman, Professor of Law at Yale University, stated in his book &quot;Hitler’s American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law&quot; that both historic US precedence and Jim Crow Era laws were openly discussed by Nazi party officials and lawyers as examples of how to legislate for racial segregation and against miscegenation that ultimately resulted in the Nuremberg Laws and the stripping of citizenship from German Jews with the Reich Citizenship Law.

==Sinti and Roma==

Nazi Germany began persecution of the Romani as early as 1936 when they began to transfer the people to municipal internment camps on the outskirts of cities, a prelude to the deportation of 23,000 Gypsies to concentration camps. &quot;Pure-blooded&quot; Gypsies were considered by the Nazis to be Aryan. Roughly ten percent of Gypsies were considered to be racially pure.

Heinrich Himmler suggested creating a &quot;Gypsy Law&quot; to separate Gypsies from the German people:

However, although many laws during Nazi Germany persecuted the Gypsies, a specific &quot;Gypsy Law&quot;, although talked about often, was never enacted by the Nazis.

==Afro-Germans==
In &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, Hitler described children resulting from marriages to African occupation soldiers as a contamination of the Aryan race &quot;by Negro blood on the Rhine in the heart of Europe.&quot; He thought that &quot;Jews were responsible for bringing Negroes into the Rhineland, with the ultimate idea of bastardizing the white race which they hate and thus lowering its cultural and political level so that the Jew might dominate.&quot; He also implied that this was a plot on the part of the French, saying the population of France was being increasingly &quot;negrified&quot;.

The number of black people in Germany when the Nazis came to power is variously estimated at 5,000 to 25,000. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington, D.C., &quot;The fate of black people from 1933 to 1945 in Nazi Germany and in German-occupied territories ranged from isolation to persecution, sterilization, medical experimentation, incarceration, brutality, and murder. However, there was no systematic program for their elimination as there was for Jews and other groups.&quot;

Prior to Hitler coming to power, black entertainers were popular in Germany, but the Nazis banned jazz as &quot;corrupt negro music&quot;.

Of particular concern to the Nazi scientist Eugen Fischer were the &quot;Rhineland Bastards&quot;: mixed-race offspring of Senegalese soldiers who had been stationed in the Rhineland as part of the French army of occupation. He believed that these people should be sterilized in order to protect the racial purity of the German population. At least 400 mixed-race children were forcibly sterilized in the Rhineland by 1938. This order only applied in the Rhineland. Other African Germans were unaffected. Despite this policy, there was never any systematic attempt to eliminate the black population in Germany, though some black people were used in medical experiments, and others mysteriously disappeared.

According to Susan Samples, the Nazis went to great lengths to conceal their sterilization and abortion program in the Rhineland. Hans Massaquoi describes his experience as a half-African in Hamburg, unaware of the Rhineland sterilizations until long after the war. Samples also points to the paradoxical fact that African-Germans actually had a better chance of surviving the war than the average German. They were excluded from military activity because of their non-Aryan status, but were not considered a threat and so were unlikely to be incarcerated. Samples and Massaquoi also note that African-Germans were not subjected to the segregation they would have experienced in the United States, nor excluded from facilities such as expensive hotels. However, they both state that downed black American pilots were more likely to become victims of violence and murder from German citizens than white pilots.

==Policies regarding Poles, Russians, and other Slavs==
As early as 1925, Hitler suggested in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; that the German people needed &quot;Lebensraum&quot; (&quot;living space&quot;) to achieve German expansion eastwards (&quot;Drang nach Osten&quot;) at the expense of the &quot;inferior Slavs&quot;. Hitler believed that &quot;the organization of a Russian state formation was not the result of the political abilities of the Slavs in Russia, but only a wonderful example of the state-forming efficacity of the German element in an inferior race.&quot;

After the invasion of the Soviet Union, Hitler expressed his future plans for the Slavs:

Nazi ideology viewed the Slavic peoples as non-Aryan &quot;Untermenschen&quot; (&quot;sub-humans&quot;), who were targeted for enslavement, expulsion and extermination. The racial status of Slavs during the Third Reich was inconsistent over time. Hitler viewed the Slavs as &quot;a mass of born slaves who feel the need of a master&quot;. Nazi propaganda portrayed the Germanic peoples as &quot;heroes&quot; in contrast to the Jewish and Slavic &quot;sub-humans&quot;. Nazi propaganda depicted Eastern Europe as racially mixed &quot;Asiatic&quot; that was dominated by the Jews with the aid of Bolshevism. The Nazis considered some people in Eastern Europe to be suitable for Germanization (they were presumed to be of German descent); if they were considered racially valuable they were to be re-Germanized and forcefully taken from their families to Germany and raised as Germans.

The final version of &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot;, essentially a grand plan for ethnic cleansing, was divided into two parts: the &quot;Kleine Planung&quot; (&quot;Small Plan&quot;), which covered actions which were to be taken during the war, and the &quot;Grosse Planung&quot; (&quot;Big Plan&quot;), which covered actions to be undertaken after the war was won (to be carried into effect gradually over a period of 25–30 years). The Small Plan was to be put into practice as the Germans conquered the areas to the east of their pre-war borders. The individual stages of this plan would then be worked out in greater detail. In this way, the plan for Poland was drawn up at the end of November 1939.

The plan envisaged removal of the majority of the population of conquered counties, with very small and varied percentages of the various conquered nations undergoing Germanisation, expulsion into the depths of Russia, and other fates, the net effect of which would be to ensure that the conquered territories would be Germanized. Himmler declared during the Germanization process that no drop of German blood would be lost or left behind to mingle with any &quot;alien races&quot;. The &quot;Wehrbauer&quot; (&quot;soldier-peasants&quot;) would settle in a fortified line to prevent civilization arising beyond and threatening Germany.

The Nazis issued the Polish decrees on 8 March 1940 which regulated the working and living conditions of Polish laborers (Zivilarbeiter) used during World War II in Germany. The decrees set out that any Pole &quot;who has sexual relations with a German man or woman, or approaches them in any other improper manner, will be punished by death.&quot; The Gestapo were extremely vigilant about sexual relations between Germans and Poles and pursued any case relentlessly where this was suspected. There were similar regulations used against the other ethnic groups brought in from Eastern Europe, including the death penalty for sexual relations with a German person. During the war, hundreds of Polish and Russian men were executed for their relations with German women.

Heinrich Himmler, in his secret memorandum &quot;Reflections on the Treatment of Peoples of Alien Races in the East&quot; dated 25 May 1940, expressed his own thoughts and the future plans for the populations in the East. Himmler stated that it was in the German interest to discover as many ethnic groups in the East and splinter them as much as possible, find and select racially valuable children to be sent to Germany to assimilate them and restrict non-Germans in the General Government and conquered territories to four-grade elementary school which would only teach them how to write their own name, to count up to 500 and to obey Germans. Himmler believed the Germanization process in Eastern Europe would be complete when &quot;in the East dwell only men with truly German, Germanic blood&quot;.

After the launch of Operation Barbarossa in 1941, Nazi Germany officially described the military invasion as a &quot;European crusade against Bolshevism&quot; in the international arena. On the other hand, Nazi propaganda targeting domestic audiences vigorously depicted the war against Soviet Union as a racial struggle of Aryans against &quot;Jewish and Slavic &quot;untermenschen&quot;&quot; to annihilate &quot;Judeo-Bolsheivism&quot;. Reich Security Main Office (RSHM) proliferated conspiratorial, racist propaganda themes that identified &quot;Jewishness with Bolshevism&quot; and vilifiied Slavs as &quot;untermenschen&quot;. These tropes were key elements of Nazi ideology and propaganda throughout World War II.

==Other &quot;non-Aryans&quot;==

Though the laws primarily targeted Jews, other &quot;non-Aryan&quot; people were subject to the laws, and to other legislation concerned with racial hygiene. The term &quot;Aryan&quot; was never fully defined—it was too imprecise and ambiguous; a number of judicial and executive decisions made attempts over time to clarify the concept. Outside of Europe, North African Arabs were by definition non-Aryan because of their &quot;African origins&quot;, but according to Alfred Rosenberg&#x27;s racial theories (&quot;The Myth of the Twentieth Century&quot;), some of the Berbers, particularly the Kabyles and the Rif, were to be classified as Aryans. The Nazis portrayed Swedes, the Afrikaners – who are white European descendants of Dutch-speaking Boers in South Africa – and higher-degree Northern/Western Europeans of South America (mainly from Uruguay, Brazil and Argentina) as ideal &quot;Aryans&quot; along with the German-speaking peoples of Greater Germany and Switzerland (the country was neutral during the war). The Roma (Gypsies), who, while considered originally Aryan, were deemed a threat to the Aryan race because of their racial mingling.

==Iranians==

Beginning in 1933, Nazi leadership made efforts to increase their influence in Iran, and they financed and managed a racist journal, &quot;Iran-e Bastan&quot;, co-edited by a pro-Nazi Iranian, Abdulrahman Saif Azad. This and other chauvinistic publications in the 1930s were popular among Iranian elites, as they &quot;highlighted the past and the pre-Islamic glories of the Persian nation and blamed the supposedly &#x27;savage Arabs and Turks&#x27; for the backwardness of Iran.&quot; The Nazis advocated the common Aryan ancestry of Iranians and Germans. As a result, in 1936 the Reich Cabinet issued a special decree exempting Iranians from any restrictions to the Nuremberg Racial Laws on the grounds that they were &quot;pure&quot; Aryans. Various pro-Nazi publications, lectures, speeches, and ceremonies, also drew parallels between Reza Shah, Hitler, and Mussolini to emphasize the charismatic resemblance among these leaders.

Nazi ideology was most common among Persian officials, elites, and intellectuals, but &quot;even some members of non-Persian groups were eager to identify themselves with the Nazis&quot; and a supposed Aryan race. In 1934, the Nazis celebrated the Ferdowsi millennial celebration in Berlin, in which the Nazi government declared that the German and Persian people share membership in a common Indo-Germanic race. Hitler declared Iran to be an &quot;Aryan country&quot;; the changing of Persia&#x27;s international name to Iran in 1935 was done by the Shah at the suggestion of the German ambassador to Iran as an act of &quot;Aryan solidarity&quot;. Also, Hitler personally promised that if he defeated the Soviet Union, he would return all of the Persian land taken by Russians during the Russo-Persian Wars. Even in 1939, Germany provided Iran with the so-called German Scientific Library. The library contained over 7,500 books selected &quot;to convince Iranian readers... of the kinship between the National Socialist Reich and the Aryan culture of Iran&quot;.

In 1936, the Nazi Office of Racial Politics, in response to a question from the German Foreign Ministry, classified non-Jewish Turks as Europeans, but &quot;left unanswered the question of how to think about the obviously non-European Arabs, Persians, and Muslims.&quot; Later that year, ahead of the Summer Olympic Games in Berlin, the Nazis responded to questions from the Egyptians by saying that the Nuremberg racial laws did not apply to them, and after the Iranian ambassador to Berlin &quot;assured German officials that &#x27;there was no doubt that the Iranian, as an Aryan,&#x27; was &#x27;racially kindred (&quot;artverwandt&quot;) with the Germans,&quot; the German Foreign Ministry &quot;assured the Iranian Embassy in Berlin that the correct distinction between was not between &quot;Aryans and non-Aryans&quot; but rather between &quot;persons of German and related blood on one hand and Jews as well as racially alien on the other.&quot; Iranians were classified as &quot;pure-blooded Aryans&quot; and thus were excluded from the Nuremberg Laws. Following the passage of the Nuremberg Laws in 1935, the Expert Advisor for Population and Racial Policy redefined &quot;Aryan&quot; as someone who is &quot;tribally&quot; related to &quot;German blood&quot;. Therefore, the official declaration by the Nazi state of Iranians being Aryans effectively rendered them as being &quot;of kindred blood&quot; to the Germans.

==Turks and Turkics==

=== Turks ===
In 1935, a half-Turkish half-German man named &quot;Johannes Ruppert&quot; was forced to leave the Hitler Youth, due to the belief that as the son of a Turkish man he was not a full Aryan as required by the Reich Citizenship Law. Ruppert sought assistance from the Turkish Embassy in Berlin to clarify how “the Aryan question” affected his case. The Turkish Embassy brought the matter to the attention of the German Foreign Ministry. In a note of December 20, 1935, a Foreign Ministry official wrote that &quot;opening up the Aryan question in relation to Turkey is extraordinarily undesirable as well as dangerous for our relations with Turkey&quot;. However, in January 1936, Foreign Ministry wrote a memo to the Nazi Party Office of Racial Policy, writing that it was &quot;essential that determination of whether the Turks are Aryan be decided as soon as possible&quot;, so that the Foreign Ministry could give &quot;a satisfactory answer&quot; to the Turkish Embassy&#x27;s repeated questions about the issue, since there had been individual cases, that is, others in addition to Ruppert, in which &quot;German citizens with Turkish mixed-blood had run into difficulties with the state and the [Nazi] Party due to their origins&quot;. The classification of Turks as &quot;non-Aryans&quot;, in keeping with Nazi racial theories, led to foreign policy complications, because the Nazis considered the Turkish government as a potential ally. Consequently, the racial theories had to be &quot;modified&quot; to some degree in accordance with foreign policy requirements. On April 30, 1936, Nazi Office for Racial Policy released a circular which stated that the Turks were &quot;Europeans&quot; while explaining that Turkish citizens of Jewish background would still be considered Jews and Turks of &quot;colored origin&quot; would be considered non-European. Some Turkish and international newspapers, such as the Swiss &quot;Le Temps&quot; and the Turkish &quot;Republique&quot;, reported at the time that the Turks had been recognized as an &quot;Aryan nation&quot; and that they were exempt from the Nuremberg laws. Turkish newspaper &quot;Akşam&quot; published an article with the headline &quot;The Turks are Aryans!&quot;. Such reports were picked up by other international newspapers, as well as by some modern scholarship, however the claim that the Turks had been recognized as an &quot;Aryan nation&quot; and that they were exempt from the Nuremberg laws was a hoax. Nazi officials themselves disputed these reports by publishing a press release which stated that they were unfounded. The Nazis classified some Turks as &quot;European&quot; and not as &quot;Aryans&quot; and the decision had no practical consequences. In addition, this decision was designed to appease Turkey from a foreign policy standpoint, although, from a racial standpoint, Nazi officials did not believe that the Turks were neither European nor Aryan.

In May 1942, a writer in the official journal of the Nazi Office for Racial Policy, &quot;Neues Volk&quot;, replied to a father&#x27;s question caused by his daughter&#x27;s relationship with a Turkish man, about whether racial differences between Germans and Turks meant that a marriage should not take place. The reply read:

Although the Nazi leadership agreed with the content of the reply, they criticized the journal for publishing it, because, in a foreign policy point of view, it was really clumsy (&quot;denkbar ungeschickt&quot;) to publish before defeating the British in Middle East. For example, Franz von Papen, the German ambassador to Turkey, informed the German Foreign Ministry that the publication of this text &quot;has serious foreign policy considerations&quot;. He noted that such statements could aid &quot;our Anglo-Saxon opponents&quot; in their &quot;propaganda against us&quot; and asked the Office of Racial Politics not to publish such things in the future. On May 16, 1942, Franz Rademacher, director of the Office of Jewish Affairs in the German Foreign Ministry, wrote to Walter Gross, the founder and editor of the magazine, that he &quot;had no objection to the content of the information from a racial-political viewpoint but that it was &quot;from a foreign policy standpoint, really clumsy” and &quot;a political blunder&quot; that would have &quot;embarrassing and awkward foreign policy implications&quot;. Nazi officials sought to prevent miscegenation between Turks and Germans and, if necessary, sought to imprison or deport the &quot;offending&quot; Turkish man.

=== Crimean Karaites ===
The Crimean Karaites, Turkic speakers following Karaite Judaism, managed to get a declaration from the Reich Agency for the Investigation of Families that they were not to be considered of Jewish religion and their racial classification should be done individually. However, not every Nazi officer or soldier were aware of the official position and a small number Karaites were murdered by German troops in Russia, as if they were Jews. The majority of the Karaites fared much better than the Turkic-speaking Jews, the Krymchaks.

== Norwegians ==
In Norway, the Nazis favored and promoted children between Germans and Norwegians, in an attempt to raise the birth rate of Nordic Aryans. Around 10,000–12,000 war children (&quot;Krigsbarn&quot;) were born from these unions during the war. Some of them were separated from their mothers and cared for in so-called &quot;Lebensborn&quot; clinics (&quot;Fountain of Life&quot; clinics).

==Finno-Ugrics==
The Finns had a debatable position in the Nazi racial policies, as they were considered a part of the &quot;Eastern Mongol race&quot; with the Sámi people in traditional racial hierarchies. Finland did not have Lebensborn centres, unlike Norway, although Finland had tens of thousands of German soldiers in the country. Archival research however has found out that 26 Finnish women were in contact with the Lebensborn program for unspecified reasons.

In 1941 Nazi Germany established the Reichskommissariat Ostland to administer the conquered territories of the Baltic region. The colonial department in Berlin under Minister Alfred Rosenberg (born in Tallinn in 1893) looked on Estonians favorably as Finno-Ugrics and thus as &quot;Aryans&quot;, Generalkommissar Karl-Siegmund Litzmann authorized a &quot;Landeseigene Verwaltung&quot;, or local national administration. As Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Finland participated in the invasion primarily to recover the territories it was forced to cede to the USSR after the Moscow Peace Treaty which ended the Winter War between the Finns and the Soviets. Owing to Finland&#x27;s substantial military contribution on the northern flank of the Eastern Front of World War II, Hitler decreed in November 1942 that &quot;from now on Finland and the Finnish people be treated and designated as a Nordic state and a Nordic people&quot;, which he considered one of the highest compliments that the Nazi government could bestow upon another country. Hitler stated in private conversation that:
After their first conflict with the Russians, the Finns applied to me, proposing that their country should become a German protectorate. I don&#x27;t regret having rejected this offer. As a matter of fact, the heroic attitude of this people, which has spent a hundred of the six hundred years of its history in fighting, deserves the greatest respect. It is infinitely better to have this people of heroes as allies than to incorporate it in the Germanic Reich—which, in any case, would not fail to provoke complications in the long run. The Finns cover one of our flanks, Turkey covers the other. That&#x27;s an ideal solution for me as far as our political protective system is concerned.

==East Asians==


In &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, Hitler expressed his praise for the Japanese&#x27;s acceptance of European civilization and his rejection of the assimilation of Chinese into Germany:
The foundation of actual life is no longer the special Japanese culture, although it determines the color of life-because outwardly, in consequence of its inner difference, it is more conspicuous to the European-but the gigantic scientific-technical achievements of Europe and America; that is, of Aryan peoples. Only on the basis of these achievements can the Orient follow general human progress. They furnish the basis of the struggle for daily bread, create weapons and implements for it, and only the outward form is gradually adapted to Japanese character.
What they mostly meant by Germanization was a process of forcing other people to speak the German language. But it is almost inconceivable how such a mistake could be made as to think that a Negro or a Chinaman will become a German because he has learned the German language and is willing to speak German for the future, and even to cast his vote for a German political party.

The need to maintain working relations with Japan and China forced the Nazis to back off from some of their previous racial rhetoric. In his &quot;Political Testament&quot; of 1945, Hitler claimed that &quot;I have never regarded the Chinese or the Japanese as being inferior to ourselves. They belong to ancient civilisations, and I admit freely that their past history is superior to our own. They have the right to be proud of their past, just as we have the right to be proud of the civilisation to which we belong.&quot; Since 1926, Germany had supported the Republic of China militarily and industrially. Germany had also sent advisers such as Alexander von Falkenhausen and Hans von Seeckt to assist the Chinese, most notably in the Chinese Civil War and China&#x27;s anti-communist campaigns. Max Bauer was sent to China and served as one of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s advisers. Around this time, Hsiang-hsi Kung, the Republic of China Minister of Finance, visited Nazi Germany and was warmly welcomed by Hitler on June 13, 1937. During this meeting, Hitler, Hermann Göring, and Hjalmar Schacht bestowed upon Kung an honorary doctorate degree, and attempted to open China&#x27;s market to German exports. In order to attract more Chinese students to study in Germany, Hitler, Göring, and Schacht earmarked for 100,000 reichsmarks for Chinese students studying in the universities and military academies of Nazi Germany after they persuaded a German industrialist to set aside the money for that purpose. Moreover, Kung, in favor of commercial credits, politely refused a generous international loan offer by Adolf Hitler. The most famous of these Nazi-trained Chinese officers was Chiang Wei-kuo, the son of Republic of China President Chiang Kai-shek, who studied military strategy and tactics at a Kriegsschule in Munich, and subsequently achieved the rank of lieutenant and served as an officer in the Wehrmacht on active combat duty in Europe until his return to the Republic of China during the later years of World War II. In fact, in the early days, the Nazis did not persecute the Chinese and allowed the Chinese to go to Germany to study or become military officers. This was because China did not become a warring country with Germany, and the countries still maintained normal exchanges, and the two sides had trade and military cooperation. And Germany can obtain cheap raw materials from China. However, during World War II, after China joined the Allies, Nazi Germany also oppressed and harmed the Chinese living in Germany. The Gestapo launched the Chinesenaktion (China action) on May 13, 1944. 129 Chinese citizens were arrested, of which at least 17 Chinese died from Gestapo shooting or forced labor.

Due to Nazi Germany&#x27;s recognition of Japanese as &quot;Aryans of the East&quot; Hitler had allowed Japanese soldiers to study in Nazi German military academies and serve in the Nazi German Wehrmacht as part of their combat training. Hitler had supported the Empire of Japan as early as 1904, when during the Russo-Japanese War it had defeated the Russians, which he considered a defeat for Austro-Slavism. He made a number of other statements expressing his respect and admiration for the Japanese in his book &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;.

Although of a separate and different evolutionary race, the Imperial Japanese were considered by Nazi ideologists such as Himmler as having sufficiently superior qualities as did German-Nordic blood to warrant an alliance. Himmler, who possessed a great interest in, and was influenced by, the anthropology, philosophies and pantheistic religions of East Asia, mentioned how his friend Hiroshi Ōshima, the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, believed that the noble castes in Japan, the daimyo and the samurai, were descended from gods of celestial origin, which was similar to Himmler&#x27;s own belief that &quot;the Nordic race did not evolve, but came directly down from heaven to settle on the Atlantic continent.&quot;

Initially, the Japanese were still subject to Germany&#x27;s racial laws, which – with the exception of the 1935 Nuremberg Laws that specifically mentioned Jews – generally applied to all &quot;non-Aryans&quot;. However, since Japanese were given &quot;Aryans of the East&quot; status, these racial laws were applied to them in a lenient manner as compared to other &quot;non-Aryans&quot; who were not granted &quot;Aryan&quot; status by Adolf Hitler. The Nazi German government began enacting the laws after taking power in 1933, and the Japanese government initially protested several racial incidents involving Japanese or Japanese-Germans that year which were then resolved by the Nazi high command by treating their Japanese allies leniently in these disputes. Especially after the collapse of Sino-German cooperation and Chinese declaration of war on Germany, Chinese nationals faced prosecution in Germany. Influential Nazi anti-Semite Johann von Leers favored excluding Japanese from the laws due both to the alleged Japanese-Aryan racial link and to improve diplomatic relations with Japan. The Foreign Ministry agreed with von Leers and sought several times between 1934 and 1937 to change the laws, but other government agencies, including the Racial Policy Office, opposed the change.

Then in October 1933, German Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath issued an exemption to and Japanese from the racial laws. Additionally, in April 1935 another Nazi decree stated that racial discrimination cases involving Aryans of the East (aka. Japanese) that might jeopardize German diplomatic relations—i.e., Japanese—would be dealt with individually. Decisions on some cases sometimes took years, with those affected unable to obtain jobs or interracially marry, primarily because the German government preferred as much as possible to avoid giving exemptions. The German government often exempted more German-Japanese than it preferred in order to avoid a repeat of the 1933 controversies, and in 1934 it prohibited the German press from discussing the race laws when Japanese were involved to avoid any diplomatic problems with China or Japan.

==Germanization between 1939 and 1945==

Nazi policy stressed the superiority of the Nordic race, a sub-race of the white European population defined by the measurement of the size and proportions of the human body models of racial difference. From 1940 the Nazi authorities in the General Government (occupied Poland) divided the population into different groups. Each group had different rights, food rations, allowed strips in the cities, separated residential areas, special schooling systems, public transportation and restricted restaurants. Later adapted in all Nazi-occupied countries by 1942, the Germanization program used the racial caste system of reserving certain rights to one group and barred privileges to another. Ethnic Poles were believed by Hitler to be &quot;biologically inferior race&quot; that could never be educated or elevated through Germanization. In 1940, Hitler approved of a plan regarding the Germanization of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, he estimated around half of the Czech population were suitable for Germanization but made clear that the &quot;mongoloid&quot; types and Czech intelligentsia were not allowed to be Germanized.

During the occupation of Poland, the Nazi government kidnapped children with Nordic racial characteristics. Those classified as &quot;racially valuable&quot; were sent from to the German Reich to be adopted and raised as Germans, while those who failed the tests would be used in slave labor or murdered in medical experiments.

Nordicist anthropometrics was used to &quot;improve&quot; the racial make-up of the Germanized section of the population, by absorbing individuals into the German population who were deemed suitably Nordic.

Germanization also affected the Sorbs, the minority Slav community living in Saxony and Brandenburg, whose Slavic culture and language was suppressed to absorb them into German identity. Tens of thousands suffered internment and imprisonment as well, to become lesser-known victims of Nazi racial laws. Similarly, the Nazis considered the people living in the Goralenvolk area to be descended from ethnic Germans and were therefore classified as Aryans.

<doc id="145554" wikidata="Q890057" url="?curid=145554" title="Body modification">
<text>Body modification (or body alteration) is the deliberate altering of the human anatomy or human physical appearance. In its broadest definition it includes skin tattooing, socially acceptable decoration (&quot;e.g.&quot;, common ear piercing in many societies), and religious rites of passage (e.g., circumcision in a number of cultures), as well as the modern primitive movement.

Body modification is performed for a large variety of reasons, including aesthetics, sexual enhancement, rites of passage, religious beliefs, to display group membership or affiliation, in remembrance of lived experience, traditional symbolism such as axis mundi and mythology, to create body art, for shock value, and as self-expression, among other reasons.

== Background ==
What counts as &quot;body modification&quot; varies in cultures. In western cultures, the cutting or removal of one&#x27;s hair is not usually considered body modification. Body modification can be contrasted with body adornment by defining body modification as &quot;the physical alteration of the physical body [...] can be temporary or permanent, although most are permanent and modify the body forever&quot;.

== Biohacking ==

Biohacking, also referred to as &quot;bodyhacking,&quot; represents a subculture of individuals experimenting with the integration of technology and biology to enhance human capabilities. This movement, pioneered by figures like Kevin Warwick, involves practices ranging from inserting magnetic implants for sensory augmentation to developing DIY bionic prosthetics. While some advances, such as brain-connected prosthetic limbs and sensory vests for the deaf, push the boundaries of art and medicine, biohacking remains a controversial field due to ethical concerns and health risks. Advocates believe it could revolutionize human potential, yet its adoption is limited by the challenges of commercial viability and mainstream acceptance.

<doc id="145555" wikidata="Q5318442" url="?curid=145555" title="XOR swap algorithm">
<text>In computer programming, the exclusive or swap (sometimes shortened to XOR swap) is an algorithm that uses the exclusive or bitwise operation to swap the values of two variables without using the temporary variable which is normally required.

The algorithm is primarily a novelty and a way of demonstrating properties of the &quot;exclusive or&quot; operation. It is sometimes discussed as a program optimization, but there are almost no cases where swapping via &quot;exclusive or&quot; provides benefit over the standard, obvious technique.

==The algorithm==
Conventional swapping requires the use of a temporary storage variable. Using the XOR swap algorithm, however, no temporary storage is needed. The algorithm is as follows:
X := Y XOR X; // XOR the values and store the result in X
Y := X XOR Y; // XOR the values and store the result in Y
X := Y XOR X; // XOR the values and store the result in X
Since XOR is a commutative operation, either X XOR Y or Y XOR X can be used interchangeably in any of the foregoing three lines. Note that on some architectures the first operand of the XOR instruction specifies the target location at which the result of the operation is stored, preventing this interchangeability. The algorithm typically corresponds to three machine-code instructions, represented by corresponding pseudocode and assembly instructions in the three rows of the following table: 

In the above System/370 assembly code sample, R1 and R2 are distinct registers, and each operation leaves its result in the register named in the first argument. Using x86 assembly, values X and Y are in registers eax and ebx (respectively), and places the result of the operation in the first register. In RISC-V assembly, value X and Y are in registers X10 and X11, and places the result of the operation in the first register (same as X86)

However, in the pseudocode or high-level language version or implementation, the algorithm fails if &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; use the same storage location, since the value stored in that location will be zeroed out by the first XOR instruction, and then remain zero; it will not be &quot;swapped with itself&quot;. This is &quot;not&quot; the same as if &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; have the same values. The trouble only comes when &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; use the same storage location, in which case their values must already be equal. That is, if &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; use the same storage location, then the line:

X := X XOR Y

sets &quot;x&quot; to zero (because &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot; so X XOR Y is zero) &quot;and&quot; sets &quot;y&quot; to zero (since it uses the same storage location), causing &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; to lose their original values.

==Proof of correctness==
The binary operation XOR over bit strings of length formula_1 exhibits the following properties (where formula_2 denotes XOR):

* L1. Commutativity: formula_3
* L2. Associativity: formula_4
* L3. Identity exists: there is a bit string, 0, (of length &quot;N&quot;) such that formula_5 for any formula_6
* L4. Each element is its own inverse: for each formula_6, formula_8.

Suppose that we have two distinct registers codice_1 and codice_2 as in the table below, with initial values &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; respectively. We perform the operations below in sequence, and reduce our results using the properties listed above.

=== Linear algebra interpretation ===
As XOR can be interpreted as binary addition and a pair of bits can be interpreted as a vector in a two-dimensional vector space over the field with two elements, the steps in the algorithm can be interpreted as multiplication by 2×2 matrices over the field with two elements. For simplicity, assume initially that &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are each single bits, not bit vectors.

For example, the step:

X := X XOR Y

which also has the implicit:

Y := Y

corresponds to the matrix formula_9 as
:formula_10
The sequence of operations is then expressed as:
:formula_11
(working with binary values, so formula_12), which expresses the elementary matrix of switching two rows (or columns) in terms of the transvections (shears) of adding one element to the other.

To generalize to where X and Y are not single bits, but instead bit vectors of length &quot;n&quot;, these 2×2 matrices are replaced by 2&quot;n&quot;×2&quot;n&quot; block matrices such as formula_13

These matrices are operating on &quot;values,&quot; not on &quot;variables&quot; (with storage locations), hence this interpretation abstracts away from issues of storage location and the problem of both variables sharing the same storage location.

==Code example==
A C function that implements the XOR swap algorithm:
void XorSwap(int *x, int *y) 
 if (x == y) return;
 *x ^= *y;
 *y ^= *x;
 *x ^= *y;

The code first checks if the addresses are distinct and uses a guard clause to exit the function early if they are equal. Without that check, if they were equal, the algorithm would fold to a triple codice_3 resulting in zero.

The XOR swap algorithm can also be defined with a macro:

#define XORSWAP_UNSAFE(a, b) \
 ((a) ^= (b), (b) ^= (a), \
 (a) ^= (b)) /* Doesn&#x27;t work when a and b are the same object - assigns zero \
 (0) to the object in that case */
#define XORSWAP(a, b) \
 ((&amp;(a) == &amp;(b)) ? (a) /* Check for distinct addresses */ \
 : XORSWAP_UNSAFE(a, b))
==Reasons for avoidance in practice==
On modern CPU architectures, the XOR technique can be slower than using a temporary variable to do swapping. At least on recent x86 CPUs, both by AMD and Intel, moving between registers regularly incurs zero latency. (This is called MOV-elimination.) Even if there is not any architectural register available to use, the codice_4 instruction will be at least as fast as the three XORs taken together. Another reason is that modern CPUs strive to execute instructions in parallel via instruction pipelines. In the XOR technique, the inputs to each operation depend on the results of the previous operation, so they must be executed in strictly sequential order, negating any benefits of instruction-level parallelism.

===Aliasing===
The XOR swap is also complicated in practice by aliasing. If an attempt is made to XOR-swap the contents of some location with itself, the result is that the location is zeroed out and its value lost. Therefore, XOR swapping must not be used blindly in a high-level language if aliasing is possible. This issue does not apply if the technique is used in assembly to swap the contents of two registers.

Similar problems occur with call by name, as in Jensen&#x27;s Device, where swapping codice_5 and codice_6 via a temporary variable yields incorrect results due to the arguments being related: swapping via codice_7 changes the value for codice_5 in the second statement, which then results in the incorrect codice_5 value for codice_6 in the third statement.

==Variations==
The underlying principle of the XOR swap algorithm can be applied to any operation meeting criteria L1 through L4 above. Replacing XOR by addition and subtraction gives various slightly different, but largely equivalent, formulations. For example:
void AddSwap( unsigned int* x, unsigned int* y )
 *x = *x + *y;
 *y = *x - *y;
 *x = *x - *y;


Unlike the XOR swap, this variation requires that the underlying processor or programming language uses a method such as modular arithmetic or bignums to guarantee that the computation of codice_11 cannot cause an error due to integer overflow. Therefore, it is seen even more rarely in practice than the XOR swap.

However, the implementation of codice_12 above in the C programming language always works even in case of integer overflow, since, according to the C standard, addition and subtraction of unsigned integers follow the rules of modular arithmetic, i. e. are done in the cyclic group formula_14 where formula_15 is the number of bits of codice_13. Indeed, the correctness of the algorithm follows from the fact that the formulas formula_16 and formula_17 hold in any abelian group. This generalizes the proof for the XOR swap algorithm: XOR is both the addition and subtraction in the abelian group formula_18 (which is the direct sum of &quot;s&quot; copies of formula_19).

This doesn&#x27;t hold when dealing with the codice_14 type (the default for codice_15). Signed integer overflow is an undefined behavior in C and thus modular arithmetic is not guaranteed by the standard, which may lead to incorrect results.

The sequence of operations in codice_12 can be expressed via matrix multiplication as:
:formula_20

== Application to register allocation ==

On architectures lacking a dedicated swap instruction, because it avoids the extra temporary register, the XOR swap algorithm is required for optimal register allocation. This is particularly important for compilers using static single assignment form for register allocation; these compilers occasionally produce programs that need to swap two registers when no registers are free. The XOR swap algorithm avoids the need to reserve an extra register or to spill any registers to main memory. The addition/subtraction variant can also be used for the same purpose.

This method of register allocation is particularly relevant to GPU shader compilers. On modern GPU architectures, spilling variables is expensive due to limited memory bandwidth and high memory latency, while limiting register usage can improve performance due to dynamic partitioning of the register file. The XOR swap algorithm is therefore required by some GPU compilers.

<text>A corset is a support garment worn to hold and train the torso into the desired shape and posture. They are traditionally constructed out of fabric with boning made of whalebone or steel, a stiff panel in the front called a busk which holds the torso rigidly upright, and some form of lacing which allows the garment to be tightened. Corsets, also known as stays, were an essential undergarment in European women&#x27;s fashion from the 17th century to the early 20th century. In the 17th and 18th centuries they had a conical, straight-sided shape. This eventually evolved into the more curvaceous 19th century form. By the beginning of the 20th century, shifting gender roles and the onsets of World War I and II (and the associated material shortages) led the corset to be largely discarded by mainstream fashion.

Since the corset fell out of use, the fashion industry has extended the term &quot;corset&quot; to refer to garments which mimic the look of traditional corsets. These modern designs may feature some amount of lacing or boning, but generally have very little, if any, effect on the shape of the wearer&#x27;s body. Elasticated garments such as girdles and waist trainers are still worn today and serve a similar purpose in shaping the waist or hips, although they lack the rigidity of corsets. A corset brace is a type of orthotic resembling a traditional corset, used to support the lower back in patients with mild to moderate back pain.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;corset&quot; is a diminutive of the Old French word &quot;cors&quot; (meaning &quot;body&quot;, and itself derived from the Latin &quot;&quot;): the word therefore means &quot;little body&quot;. The craft of corset construction is known as &quot;corsetry&quot;, as is the general wearing of them. (The word &quot;corsetry&quot; is sometimes also used as a collective plural form of corset). Someone who makes corsets is a &quot;corsetier&quot; or &quot;corsetière&quot; (French terms for a man and for a woman maker, respectively), or sometimes simply a &quot;corsetmaker&quot;.

In 1828, the word corset came into general use in the English language. The word was used in &quot;The Ladies Magazine&quot; to describe a &quot;quilted waistcoat&quot; that the French called &quot;un corset.&quot; It was used to differentiate the lighter corset from the heavier stays of the period.

==Uses==
===Fashion===
As the form and purpose of the corset constantly evolved throughout its time as a standard undergarment, there is no way to definitively state how it was worn. While the original purpose of stiffened undergarments was to avoid creasing more costly, highly adorned outer garments, the most common and well-known use of corsets is to slim the body and make it conform to a fashionable silhouette. 

==== 16th and 17th centuries ====

In the Tudor period, corsets, known then as &quot;bodies&quot;, were worn to achieve a tubular straight-up-and-down shape, which involved minimizing the bust. These bodies, worn by women and men, were common into the 16th and 17th centuries and achieved their stiffened shaping with materials including steel, wood, or whalebone. They were constructed of two parts and fastened at the sides. Bodies evolved into the stays of the 17th century. Stays shaped the body to fit the desired silhouette, which, for example, in the 1780s resembled an inverted cone shape. They an also ensured good posture and the appearance of smooth contours – the central aim of such undergarments of this period, rather than exaggerating the bust and waist.

==== 19th century ====
During end of the 1700s up until the 1820s, in reflection of the neoclassical style of dress, the demi-corset or short stays became popular, as the empire line of fashionable gowns did not require support or shaping to the waist. These garments ended at or just above the waist, supporting the bust without providing shaping to the rest of the torso. 
For men, corsets were sporadically used to slim the figure. From around 1820 to 1835—and even until the late 1840s in some instances—a wasp-waisted figure (a small, nipped-in look to the waist) was also desirable for men; wearing a corset sometimes served to achieve this. However, by the mid-1800s onward, men&#x27;s corsets fell out of favor, and were generally considered effeminate and pretentious.

After the early 1800s, the wasp waist silhouette came into vogue for women, and the advent of steel eyelets and boning allowed for stronger, more durable corsets that could create greater reductions in waist size. This period saw the creation of the curvaceous, nipped-in corsets that we most commonly associate with the term &quot;corset&quot; today.

During the 19th century, all infants generally wore some kind of stiffened waistband, and female children were transitioned to the corset at some point before or during adolescence. In some cases, mothers started their daughters wearing corsets in early childhood. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the practice in its Fashion section in 1881.

An &quot;overbust corset&quot; encloses the torso, extending from just under the arms toward the hips. An &quot;underbust corset&quot; begins just under the breasts and extends down toward the hips. A &quot;longline corset&quot;—either overbust or underbust—extends past the iliac crest, or the hip bone. A longline corset creates the appearance of a longer torso and narrower hips. This style was common during the 1910s, when slim hips came into vogue, and later evolved into the elasticated girdle. A &quot;standard&quot; length corset stops short of the iliac crest. Some corsets, in very rare instances, reach the knees. A shorter kind of corset that covers the waist area (from low on the ribs to just above the hips), is called a &quot;waist cincher&quot;. A corset may also include garters to hold up stockings; alternatively, a separate garter belt may be worn.
A corset supports the visible dress and distributes the weight of large structural garments, such as the crinoline and bustle. At times, a corset cover is used to protect outer clothes from the corset and to smooth the lines of the corset. The original corset cover was worn under the corset to provide a layer between it and the body. Corsets were not worn next to the skin, possibly due to difficulties with laundering these items during the 19th century, as they had steel boning and metal eyelets that would rust. Light linen or cotton shifts (also called chemises) were worn beneath corsets to absorb sweat and protect the corset and wearer from each other, and also to function as underwear and protect other garments from the wearer and their sweat. The corset cover was generally in the form of a light chemisette, made from cotton lawn or silk. Modern corset wearers may wear corset liners for many of the same reasons. Those who lace their corsets tightly use the liners to prevent burn on their skin from the laces.

===Fetish ===

Aside from fashion and medical uses, corsets are also used in sexual fetishism, most notably in Bondage/Discipline/Sado-Masochism (BDSM). In BDSM, a submissive may be required to wear a corset, which would be laced very tightly and restrict the wearer to some degree. A dominant may also wear a corset, often black, but for entirely different reasons, such as aesthetics. A specially designed corset, in which the breasts and vulva are exposed, can be worn during &quot;vanilla sex&quot; or BDSM activities. Dress historian David Kunzle argues in his work &quot;Fashion and Fetishism&quot; that historical usage of the corset had a fetishistic dimension as some wearers reported feeling sexual pleasure from the use of the garment, and the corseted waist was highly sexualized by men and women alike.

===Medical===
A corset brace is a lumbar support that is used in the prevention and treatment of lower-back pain. They can also be prescribed to patients healing from spinal surgery. A corset brace resembles a historical corset, but is typically made with elastic fabric and plastic boning to allow for more flexibility. Metal boning may be used if more rigidity is needed. Artist Andy Warhol was shot in 1968 and never fully recovered; he wore a corset for the rest of his life.

==Construction==

Corsets are typically constructed of a stiff material, such as buckram, structured with boning (also called ribs or stays) inserted into channels in the cloth or leather. In the 18th and early 19th century, thin strips of baleen (also known as whalebone) were favoured for the boning. Plastic is the most commonly used material for modern corsets and the majority of poor-quality corsets. Spring and/or spiral steel or synthetic whalebone is preferred for stronger and generally better quality corsets. Other materials used for boning have included ivory, wood, and cane.

Corsets are held together by lacing, usually (though not always) at the back. Tightening or loosening the lacing produces corresponding changes in the firmness of the corset. Depending on the desired effect and time period, corsets can be laced from the top down, from the bottom up, or both up from the bottom and down from the top, using the bunny ears lacing method. Victorian corsets also had a buttoned or hooked front opening called a busk. If the corset was worn loosely, it was possible to leave the lacing as adjusted and take the corset on and off using the front opening. (If the corset is worn snugly, this method will damage the busk if the lacing is not significantly loosened beforehand).

=== Manufacture and design ===
In the 1660s, the manufacture of stays, as they were known during the period, began to emerge as its own profession in France. These craftsmen were known as staymakers. The work was specialized and generally considered men&#x27;s work, although women often assisted in the construction process sewing together pieces cut and fitted by men. Women were excluded from staymaker&#x27;s guilds, and the work was considered too strenuous for women to do correctly.

By the 19th century, corsets became one of the first garments to be manufactured in factories via assembly line. Each step was performed by a different group of people, often children. Heavy or messy work was done in house, such as cutting the fabric pieces and japanning the steels to prevent rust, and lighter work, such as sewing the bones in place, was taken home by piece workers, generally women who enlisted their children to help them. Workers in corset factories were among the most poorly-paid in London, and frequently could not make enough to meet their daily living expenses.

Although the corsetmaking industry was dominated by men, a number of woman designers and inventors became known for their work in this field. Among them included Roxey Ann Caplin, who consulted her physician husband to create corsets with respect to modern knowledge of female anatomy. The field of corsetmaking was one in which new designs were continually submitted and patented, often with the desire to create ever stronger or stiffer corsets that were less likely to break.

=== Comfort ===
In the past, a woman&#x27;s corset was usually worn over a chemise, a sleeveless low-necked gown made of washable material (usually cotton or linen). It absorbed perspiration and kept the corset and the gown clean. In modern times, a tee shirt, camisole, or corset liner may be worn. In the late Victorian period, as anxiety around the health effects of corseting increased, the &quot;health corset&quot; became popularized, typically featuring woolen lining and other features such as elasticated panels or steel watch springs instead of steel strips for boning. 

==Waist reduction==
Prior to the invention of the steel eyelet in 1827, the corset primarily served to smooth the lines of the torso and support the posture. Steel eyelets as well as steel boning and busks allowed wearers to lace their corsets significantly more tightly without damaging the garment, and created the wasp-waisted shape now associated with the corset. Nineteenth century writing on female beauty emphasized the importance of a small, round waist, an exaggeration of the difference between the male and female figure. The corset was the primary tool used to achieve this figure.

Dress historian David Kunzle estimates that the average corseted waist size of the 1880s was approximately , with an uncorseted waist size of about . He argues that extreme reduction - tightlacing - was largely the domain of middle to lower-middle-class women hoping to increase their station in life, although the amount of reduction that constituted &quot;tightlacing&quot; was never precisely defined. A corseted waist of was considered &quot;standard&quot; and one of &quot;severe&quot; but not unheard of. Beauty writer Arnold Cooley complained that that while natural waist sizes were generally around 28 to 29 inches, most women did not allow themselves to exceed 24 inches, and that sizes of 22-20 inches were seen in &quot;deluded victims of fashion and vanity.&quot; Statistics from 1888 indicate that the average waist size had decreased over the past 25 years, attributed to tightlacing itself as well as the lowered respiration and food intake permitted by corset usage. 

Modern wearers are unlikely to achieve the same degree of reduction that was recorded in historical usage. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, corset training was usually begun during adolescence or even before. The slimmest waist sizes on record should be contextualized with the fact that they were seen in teenage girls, and were likely to have been reserved for special occasions such as dances.

Until 1998, the Guinness Book of World Records listed Ethel Granger as having the smallest waist on record at . After 1998, the category changed to &quot;smallest waist on a living person&quot;. Cathie Jung took the title with a waist measuring . Other women, such as Polaire, also have achieved such reductions: in her case. Empress Sisi of Austria was known to have a very slender waist at 16 inches.

== Health effects ==

The negative physical effects of corseting have become widely known, including a variety of myths. For example, the idea that Victorian women frequently underwent rib removal to achieve a smaller waist is baseless. However, wearing a corset does affect a number of bodily functions and can be deleterious to the wearer&#x27;s health, especially when worn regularly over a long period of time; during the Victorian era stays were typically begun at or before the onset of puberty, with reported ages ranging from 7 to 13.

=== Respiration ===
Moderately laced corsets have been demonstrated to reduce lung capacity anywhere from 2 to 29%, with an average of 9%, and can cause an increase in shortness of breath during moderate exercise such as dancing. In a study of 16 subjects, those with smaller-than-average (&gt;32.5 in) waists were found to experience a greater reduction of lung capacity, but those with above-average waist sizes had more difficulty recovering to their initial lung capacity after the corset was removed; this replicated the results of historical studies. Based on such studies as well as modern accounts of corset usage, accounts of fainting due to corset usage are thought to be credible. Dances were often a reason to lace a corset unusually tight, which combined with exercise could lead to shortness of breath.

Doctors warned corseted women against &quot;everything that [was] worthy of the name exercise&quot; to avoid strain, although some guides were written on light calisthenics to be done by young women who would presumably be wearing corsets. Typical exercises included stretching, dance steps, and skipping, largely focusing on moving the limbs and balancing. As women&#x27;s social freedom increased during the second half of the 19th century, sport corsets began to be sold, designed for wear while bicycling, playing tennis, or horseback riding. These designs typically incorporated some form of elastic panelling or mesh.

Corsets were widely thought to contribute to tuberculosis. Prior to the advent of germ theory, some thought corsets directly caused the disease, as women were significantly more likely to contract and die from the disease than men in this era. Others thought corsets contributed to TB deaths due to impairment of lung function. 

=== Muscular wasting ===
Corsets are known to contribute significantly to muscle wasting in the core and back when worn over long periods of time. Although they temporarily relieve back pain, muscle atrophy due to disuse will lead to increased lower-back pain and eventually reliance on the corset to stand upright without pain. Forceps delivery was standard during this period, which could be due to atrophy of the abdominal muscles caused by lifelong corset usage.

=== Skeletal deformities ===
Skeletal analyses have found that the usage of corsets had a significant effect on the form of the spine, ribs, and hips. This change was permanent when the corset was used in early childhood and adolescence; modern wearers who begin usage in adulthood may see some temporary changes. The consequences of this change are not fully agreed upon by researchers. Underdevelopment of the pelvic inlet may have contributed to difficulties in birth.

=== Pelvic floor and reproductive health ===
A significant source of the controversy surrounding corsets was their ability to affect the reproductive system due to the downward pressure created by displacement of organs. One Doctor Lewis writes in an 1882 edition of &quot;The North American Review&quot;:

This quote alludes to problems with the reproductive organs experienced by women who tightlaced, and demonstrates the difficulties of explaining this issue due to Victorian taboos around discussing sexuality. Reformist and activist Catharine Beecher was one of the few to defy propriety norms and discuss in any detail the gynecological issues resulting from lifelong corset usage, in particular uterine prolapse. Corsets were usually worn during pregnancy, often as long as possible, to suppress and disguise the appearance of the growing fetus. Obstetrician and writer Alice Bunker Stockham campaigned against the widespread practice of wearing corsets during pregnancy, writing sardonically: &quot;The corset should not be worn for two hundred years before pregnancy.&quot; Feminist historian Leigh Summers theorized that some of the moral panic came from the common but unspeakable idea that tightlacing could be used to induce an abortion. Doctors often attributed the difficult births many Victorian women experienced to corsets, widely believing that &quot;primitive&quot; women who wore less restrictive garments had less painful births and were overall healthier and more vigorous. 

Modern skeletal analyses indicate that corseting, particularly during pre-puberty (most girls began in early or pre-adolescence), led to underdevelopment of the pelvic inlet, which is consistent with reported difficulties in birth, although studies into this topic have been mixed. Surgery Professor Arthur Cleland of Glasgow reported that it was common, upon autopsy, to find atrophied ovaries in women who were upper class, shop assistants, or household servants, but not in those considered &quot;rough&quot; working class.

==== Prolapse ====
Uterine prolapse was a condition likely exacerbated by regular corset usage. Both rectal and uterine prolapse occurred at a higher incidence during the Victorian era than today, with occurrences declining as the corset fell out of fashion. An 1888 doctor reported that “uterine derangement had increased fifty percent within the last fifteen years as a result of tight clothing, corsets and high heels.&quot; This era saw the development of a number of pessaries and other devices patented to support the prolapsed uterus, the insertion of which frequently led to further complications; the topic was a subject of wide professional discussion among gynecologists.

=== Miscellaneous ===
Corset wearing is known to decrease the size of the stomach and constrict intestinal motility, potentially leading to constipation or indigestion. The downward pressure on the pelvic floor can also lead to urinary incontinence, similar to that experienced during pregnancy. Friction and pressure from the corset may also cause abrasions or bruising of the skin. The pressure exerted by a corset may have also negatively affected kidney function, potentially contributing to hypertension. The displacement of fat caused by a corset may lead to distension in the lower abdomen that persists when the corset is removed, an effect that can be exacerbated by the muscular weakness caused by corset usage.

Chlorosis is a now-outdated term which referred to a disease thought to be caused directly by corsets, the symptoms of which correspond to what is now called hypochromic anemia. The illness, also known as green sickness, was associated with the onset of menarche and fell under the umbrella of &quot;female complaints&quot;: problems attributed to the increasing demands that puberty brought onto the frail female body. The physician Frederick Parkes Weber posited that the disease may have been caused by corset wearing, noting that the illness never appeared in boys, that fat rather than thin girls were more likely to experience it, and that prolonged bed rest seemed to resolve the symptoms, while trips to the sea (during which corsets would still be worn) did not.

== History ==
For nearly 500 years, bodies, stays, or corsets with boning made of reeds, whalebone, or metal were a standard part of European women&#x27;s fashion. Researchers have found evidence of the use of corsets in the Minoan civilization of early Crete.

===16th and 17th centuries===
In the late 16th century, what would later be known as the corset was called &quot;a pair of bodys.&quot; It consisted of a simple bodice, stiffened with boning of reed or whalebone. A busk made of wood, horn, whalebone, metal, or ivory further reinforced the central front and created an upright posture. It was most often laced in the back, and was, at first, a garment reserved for the aristocracy. Later, the term &quot;pair of bodies&quot; would be replaced with the term &quot;stays&quot; and was generally used during the 17th and 18th centuries. Stays shaped the upper torso into a cone or cylinder shape. In the 17th century, tabs (called &quot;fingers&quot;) at the waist were added.

===18th century===
Stays evolved in the 18th century, during which whalebone was used more, and increased boning was used in the garment. The shape of the stays changed as well. While they were low and wide in the front, they could reach as high as the upper shoulder in the back. Stays could be strapless or use shoulder straps. The straps of the stays were generally attached in the back and tied at the front.

The purpose of 18th century stays was to support the bust and confer the fashionable conical torso shape, while drawing the shoulders back. At that time, the eyelets were reinforced with stitches and were not placed across from one another, but staggered. That allowed the stays to be spiral laced. One end of the stay lace was inserted into the bottom eyelet and knotted, and the other end was wound through the eyelets of the stays and tightened on the top. &quot;Jumps&quot; were a variant of stays, which were looser, had no boning, and sometimes had attached sleeves, like a jacket. Women of all levels of society wore stays or jumps, from ladies of the court to street vendors.

Corsets were originally quilted waistcoats, which French women wore as an alternative to stiff stays. They were only quilted linen, laced in the front, and unboned. That garment was meant to be worn on informal occasions, while stays were worn for court dress. In the 1790s, stays began to fall out of fashion. That coincided with the French Revolution and the adoption of neoclassical styles of dress. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, some men were known to wear corsets, particularly the widely mocked dandies.

===19th century===
In the early 19th century, when gussets were added for room for the bust, stays became known as corsets. They also lengthened to the hip, and the lower tabs were replaced by gussets at the hip and had less boning. In the 1820s, fashion changed again, with the waistline lowered to almost the natural position. That was to allow for more ornamentation on the bodice, which, in turn, saw the return of the corset to modern fashion. Corsets began to be made with some padding, for a waist-slimming effect, and more boning. Some women made their own, while others bought their corsets. Corsets were one of the first mass-produced garments for women. They began to be more heavily boned in the 1840s, and the shoulder straps were eliminated. By 1850, steel boning became popular.

With the advent of metal eyelets in 1827, tightlacing became possible. The position of the eyelets changed. They were situated opposite one another at the back. The front was fastened with a metal busk. The corsets of the 1850s–1860s were shorter, because of a change in the silhouette of women&#x27;s fashion, with the advent of the hoop skirt or crinoline. After the 1860s, as the crinoline fell out of style, the corset became longer, to shape the abdomen, exposed by the new lines of the princess or cuirass style.

In 1855, a woman named Frances Egbert had trouble with her corsets, due to the front steel pieces constantly breaking as a result of strain. Consequently, her husband, Samuel Barnes, designed &quot;reinforced steels&quot; for Egbert&#x27;s corsets. Barnes filed a patent for the invention 11 years later, and Egbert collected the royalties on this patent for 15 years following his death. Following the case of &quot;Egbert v. Lippmann&quot;, the US Supreme court deemed Barnes&#x27;s and Egbert&#x27;s patent as &quot;public&quot;.

=== Corset controversy and dress reform ===

The new practice of tight-lacing instigated widespread controversy. Dress reformists claimed that the corset was prompted by vanity and foolishness, and harmful to health. The reported health risks included damaged and rearranged internal organs, compromised fertility; weakness and general depletion of health. Those who were pro-corset argued that it was required for stylish dress and had its own unique pleasures; dress historian David Kunzle theorized that some enthusiastic fans of tightlacing may have experienced sexual pleasure when tightlacing, or by rubbing against the front of the corset, which contributed to the moral outrage against the practice.

The corset controversy was also closely tied to notions of social Darwinism and eugenics. The potential damage to the uterus, ovaries, and fetus was frequently pointed to as a danger to the race; i.e., the European race. Western women were thought to be weaker and more prone to birth complications than the ostensibly more vigorous, healthier, &quot;primitive&quot; races who did not wear corsets. Dress reformers exhorted readers to loosen their corsets, or risk destroying the &quot;civilized&quot; races. On the other hand, those who argued for the importance of corsets cited Darwinism as well, specifically the notion that women were less evolved and thus frailer, in need of the external support of a corset.

The reformers&#x27; critique of the corset was one part of a throng of voices clamoring against tightlacing. Doctors counseled patients against it and journalists wrote articles condemning the vanity and frivolity of women who would sacrifice their health for the sake of fashion. Although for many, corseting was accepted as necessary for health, propriety, and an upright military-style posture, dress reformers viewed tightlacing, especially at the height of the era of Victorian morality, as a sign of moral indecency.

American women active in the anti-slavery and temperance movements, with experience in public speaking and political agitation, advocated for and wore sensible clothing that would not restrict their movement, although corsets were a part of their wardrobe. While supporters of fashionable dress contended that corsets maintained an upright, &quot;good figure&quot;, and were a necessary physical structure for a moral and well-ordered society, dress reformers maintained that women&#x27;s fashions were not only physically detrimental, but &quot;the results of male conspiracy to make women subservient by cultivating them in slave psychology&quot;. They believed a change in fashions could change the position of women in society, allowing for greater social mobility, independence from men and marriage, and the ability to work for wages, as well as physical movement and comfort.

In 1873, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward wrote:

Despite those protests, little changed in fashion and undergarments up to 1900. The majority accepted corsets as necessary on some level, and relatively few advocated for it to be abandoned entirely. The primary result of the dress reform movement was the evolution, rather than elimination, of the corset. Because of the public health outcry surrounding corsets and tightlacing, doctors took it upon themselves to become corsetieres. Many doctors helped to fit their patients with corsets to avoid the dangers of ill-fitting corsets, and some doctors even designed corsets themselves. Roxey Ann Caplin became a widely renowned corset maker, enlisting the help of her husband, a physician, to create corsets which she purported to be more respectful of human anatomy. Health corsets and &quot;rational corsets&quot; became popular alternatives to the boned corset. They included features such as wool lining, watch springs as boning, elastic paneling, and other features purported to be less detrimental to one&#x27;s health.

In the 1890s, Inès Gaches-Sarraute designed the straight-front corset in response to her patients&#x27; gynecological issues which were attributed to wearing corsets. The design was intended to reduce pressure on the abdomen and improve overall health. The new S-curve silhouette created by this design quickly caught on among fashion houses in the early 20th century. The style was worn from 1900 to 1908.

===Early 20th century===

The corset reached its longest length in the early 20th century. At first, the longline corset reached from the bust down to the upper thigh. There was also a style of longline corset that started under the bust, and necessitated the wearing of a brassiere, a style that was meant to complement the new silhouette. It was a boneless style, much closer to a modern girdle than the traditional corset. From 1908 to 1914, the fashionable narrow-hipped and narrow-skirted silhouette necessitated the lengthening of the corset at its lower edge. Meanwhile, as bras began to catch on in the 1910s, fewer and fewer corsets included bust support. The fashionable corsets of this period covered the thighs and changed the position of the hips, making the waist appear higher and wider and the hips narrower, forecasting the &quot;flapper&quot; silhouette of the 1920s. The new fashion was considered uncomfortable, cumbersome, and required the use of strips of elastic fabric. The development of rubberized elastic materials in 1911 helped the girdle replace the corset.

In 1910, the physician Robert Latou Dickinson published &quot;Toleration of the corset: Prescribing where one cannot proscribe&quot;, in which he investigated the medical effects of corsets, including the displacement and deformation of internal organs. He found that, while some women could wear these garments without apparent harm, the vast majority of users sustained permanent deformations and damage to their health. The purportedly healthier S-line corsets still restricted costal breathing and exerted pressure downwards on the pelvis.

The longline style was abandoned during World War I, in part to save materials for the war effort. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, there was a brief revival of the corset in the form of the waist cincher sometimes called a &quot;waspie&quot;. This was used to give the hourglass figure as dictated by Christian Dior&#x27;s &quot;New Look&quot;. However, use of the waist cincher was restricted to haute couture, and most women continued to use girdles. Waspies were also met with push-back from women&#x27;s organizations in the United States, as well as female members of the British Parliament, because corsetry had been forbidden under rationing during World War II. The revival ended when the New Look gave way to a less dramatically shaped silhouette.

=== Late 20th century ===
By the 1960s, the advent of hippie culture and youth rebellion led the wasp-waisted silhouette to fall out of favor. Feminist activists protested against the restrictive nature of Dior&#x27;s designs. In 1968 at the feminist Miss America protest, protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a &quot;Freedom Trash Can.&quot; These included girdles and corsets, which were among items the protestors called &quot;instruments of female torture&quot;. The 1960s and 1970s saw the rise of popular fitness culture, and diet, plastic surgery (modern liposuction was invented in the mid-1970s), and exercise became the preferred methods of achieving a thin waist. The sexual revolution of the 1960s and 70s brought with it midriff-revealing styles like the crop top, and many women chose to forgo supportive undergarments like girdles or corsets, preferring a more athletic figure.

The corset has largely fallen out of mainstream fashion since the 1920s in Europe and North America, replaced by girdles and elastic brassieres, but has survived as an article of costume. Originally an item of lingerie, the corset has become a popular item of outerwear in the fetish, BDSM, and Goth subcultures. In the fetish and BDSM literature, there is often much emphasis on tightlacing, and many corset makers cater to the fetish market.

Outside the fetish community, living history reenactors and historic costume enthusiasts still wear stays and corsets according to their original purpose to give the proper shape to the figure when wearing historic fashions. In this case, the corset is underwear rather than outerwear. Skilled corset makers are available to make reproductions of historic corset shapes or to design new styles.

Since the late 1980s, the corset has experienced periodic revivals, all which have usually originated in haute couture and have occasionally trickled through to mainstream fashion. Fashion designer Vivienne Westwood&#x27;s use of corsets contributed to the push-up bust trend that lasted from the late 1980s throughout the 1990s. Those revivals focused on the corset as an item of outerwear rather than underwear. The strongest of the revivals was seen in the Autumn 2001 fashion collections and coincided with the release of the film &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;, in which the costumes featured many corsets as characteristic of the era. Another fashion movement, which has renewed interest in the corset, is the steampunk subculture that utilizes late-Victorian fashion shapes in new ways. In the early 2020s, corset-inspired tops and dresses began to trend as part of the regencycore aesthetic, inspired by television series like &quot;Bridgerton&quot; and &quot;The Gilded Age&quot;. These designs typically do not incorporate any form of boning.

=== Popular culture ===
Modern historical fiction films and TV shows such as &quot;Bridgerton&quot; have renewed interest in corsets while also drawing attention to potential health risks as actresses including Emma Stone, Cara Delevingne, and Simone Ashley have complained about discomfort wearing them during the course of their careers.

==Special variants==
There are some special types of corsets and corset-like devices which incorporate boning.

===Corset dress===
A corset dress (also known as hobble corset because it produces similar restrictive effects to a hobble skirt) is a long corset. It is like an ordinary corset, but it is long enough to cover the legs, partially or totally. It thus looks like a dress, hence the name. A person wearing a corset dress can have great difficulty in walking up and down the stairs (especially if wearing high-heeled footwear) and may be unable to sit down if the boning is too stiff.

Other types of corset dresses are created for unique high fashion looks by a few modern corset makers. These modern styles are functional as well as fashionable and are designed to be worn with comfort for a dramatic look.

===Neck corset and collar===

A neck corset is a type of posture collar incorporating stays and it is generally not considered to be a true corset. This type of corset and its purpose of improving posture does not have long term results. Since certain parts of the neck are being pulled towards the head, a band in the neck, called the platysmal band, will most likely disappear. Like the neck corset, a collar serves some of the same purposes. The neck collar can be worn to allow minimal neck movement after road accidents, and is more accessible and cheap than physiotherapy. However, neck corsets and collars are more often used as a fashion statement or as an element of BDSM rather than physiotherapy.

<text>Prophase () is the first stage of cell division in both mitosis and meiosis. Beginning after interphase, DNA has already been replicated when the cell enters prophase. The main occurrences in prophase are the condensation of the chromatin reticulum and the disappearance of the nucleolus.

== Staining and microscopy ==
Microscopy can be used to visualize condensed chromosomes as they move through meiosis and mitosis.

Various DNA stains are used to treat cells such that condensing chromosomes can be visualized as the move through prophase.

The giemsa G-banding technique is commonly used to identify mammalian chromosomes, but utilizing the technology on plant cells was originally difficult due to the high degree of chromosome compaction in plant cells. G-banding was fully realized for plant chromosomes in 1990. During both meiotic and mitotic prophase, giemsa staining can be applied to cells to elicit G-banding in chromosomes. Silver staining, a more modern technology, in conjunction with giemsa staining can be used to image the synaptonemal complex throughout the various stages of meiotic prophase. To perform G-banding, chromosomes must be fixed, and thus it is not possible to perform on living cells.

Fluorescent stains such as DAPI can be used in both live plant and animal cells. These stains do not band chromosomes, but instead allow for DNA probing of specific regions and genes. Use of fluorescent microscopy has vastly improved spatial resolution.

== Mitotic prophase ==
Prophase is the first stage of mitosis in animal cells, and the second stage of mitosis in plant cells. At the start of prophase there are two identical copies of each chromosome in the cell due to replication in interphase. These copies are referred to as sister chromatids and are attached by DNA element called the centromere. The main events of prophase are: the condensation of chromosomes, the movement of the centrosomes, the formation of the mitotic spindle, and the beginning of nucleoli break down.

=== Condensation of chromosomes ===
DNA that was replicated in interphase is condensed from DNA strands with lengths reaching 0.7 μm down to 
0.2-0.3 μm. This process employs the condensin complex. Condensed chromosomes consist of two sister chromatids joined at the centromere.

=== Movement of centrosomes ===
During prophase in animal cells, centrosomes move far enough apart to be resolved using a light microscope. Microtubule activity in each centrosome is increased due to recruitment of γ-tubulin. Replicated centrosomes from interphase move apart towards opposite poles of the cell, powered by centrosome associated motor proteins. Interdigitated interpolar microtubules from each centrosome interact with each other, helping to move the centrosomes to opposite poles.

=== Formation of the mitotic spindle ===
Microtubules involved in the interphase scaffolding break down as the replicated centrosomes separate. The movement of centrosomes to opposite poles is accompanied in animal cells by the organization of individual radial microtubule arrays (asters) by each centriole. Interpolar microtubules from both centrosomes interact, joining the sets of microtubules and forming the basic structure of the mitotic spindle. Plant cells do not have centrosomes and the chromosomes can nucleate microtubule assembly into the mitotic apparatus. In plant cells, microtubules gather at opposite poles and begin to form the spindle apparatus at locations called foci. The mitotic spindle is of great importance in the process of mitosis and will eventually segregate the sister chromatids in metaphase.

=== Beginning of nucleoli breakdown ===
The nucleoli begin to break down in prophase, resulting in the discontinuation of ribosome production. This indicates a redirection of cellular energy from general cellular metabolism to cellular division. The nuclear envelope stays intact during this process.

== Meiotic prophase ==
Meiosis involves two rounds of chromosome segregation and thus undergoes prophase twice, resulting in prophase I and prophase II. Prophase I is the most complex phase in all of meiosis because homologous chromosomes must pair and exchange genetic information. Prophase II is very similar to mitotic prophase.

=== Prophase I ===
Prophase I is divided into five phases: leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, diplotene, and diakinesis. In addition to the events that occur in mitotic prophase, several crucial events occur within these phases such as pairing of homologous chromosomes and the reciprocal exchange of genetic material between these homologous chromosomes. Prophase I occurs at different speeds dependent on species and sex. Many species arrest meiosis in diplotene of prophase I until ovulation. In humans, decades can pass as oocytes remain arrested in prophase I only to quickly complete meiosis I prior to ovulation.

==== Leptotene ====

In the first stage of prophase I, leptotene (from the Greek for &quot;delicate&quot;), chromosomes begin to condense. Each chromosome is in a diploid state and consists of two sister chromatids; however, the chromatin of the sister chromatids is not yet condensed enough to be resolvable in microscopy. Homologous regions within homologous chromosome pairs begin to associate with each other.

==== Zygotene ====
In the second phase of prophase I, zygotene (from the Greek for &quot;conjugation&quot;), all maternally and paternally derived chromosomes have found their homologous partner. The homologous pairs then undergo synapsis,a process by which the synaptonemal complex (a proteinaceous structure) aligns corresponding regions of genetic information on maternally and paternally derived non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosome pairs. The paired homologous chromosome bound by the synaptonemal complex are referred to as bivalents or tetrads. Sex (X and Y) chromosomes do not fully synapse because only a small region of the chromosomes are homologous.

The nucleolus moves from a central to a peripheral position in the nucleus.

==== Pachytene ====
The third phase of prophase I, pachytene (from the Greek for &quot;thick&quot;), begins at the completion of synapsis. Chromatin has condensed enough that chromosomes can now be resolved in microscopy. Structures called recombination nodules form on the synaptonemal complex of bivalents. These recombination nodules facilitate genetic exchange between the non-sister chromatids of the synaptonemal complex in an event known as crossing-over or genetic recombination. Multiple recombination events can occur on each bivalent. In humans, an average of 2-3 events occur on each chromosome.

==== Diplotene ====
In the fourth phase of prophase I, diplotene (from the Greek for &quot;twofold&quot;), crossing-over is completed. Homologous chromosomes retain a full set of genetic information; however, the homologous chromosomes are now of mixed maternal and paternal descent. Visible junctions called chiasmata hold the homologous chromosomes together at locations where recombination occurred as the synaptonemal complex dissolves. It is at this stage where meiotic arrest occurs in many species.

==== Diakinesis ====
In the fifth and final phase of prophase I, diakinesis (from the Greek for &quot;double movement&quot;), full chromatin condensation has occurred and all four sister chromatids can be seen in bivalents with microscopy. The rest of the phase resemble the early stages of mitotic prometaphase, as the meiotic prophase ends with the spindle apparatus beginning to form, and the nuclear membrane beginning to break down.

=== Prophase II ===
Prophase II of meiosis is very similar to prophase of mitosis. The most noticeable difference is that prophase II occurs with a haploid number of chromosomes as opposed to the diploid number in mitotic prophase. In both animal and plant cells chromosomes may de-condense during telophase I requiring them to re-condense in prophase II. If chromosomes do not need to re-condense, prophase II often proceeds very quickly as is seen in the model organism Arabidopsis.

==Prophase I arrest==
Female mammals and birds are born possessing all the oocytes needed for future ovulations, and these oocytes are arrested at the prophase I stage of meiosis. In humans, as an example, oocytes are formed between three and four months of gestation within the fetus and are therefore present at birth. During this prophase I arrested stage (dictyate), which may last for decades, four copies of the genome are present in the oocytes. The adaptive significance of prophase I arrest is still not fully understood. However, it has been proposed that the arrest of oocytes at the four genome copy stage may provide the informational redundancy needed to repair damage in the DNA of the germline. The repair process used appears to be homologous recombinational repair Prophase arrested oocytes have a high capability for efficient repair of DNA damages. DNA repair capability appears to be a key quality control mechanism in the female germ line and a critical determinant of fertility.

== Differences in plant and animal cell prophase ==

The most notable difference between prophase in plant cells and animal cells occurs because plant cells lack centrioles. The organization of the spindle apparatus is associated instead with foci at opposite poles of the cell or is mediated by chromosomes. Another notable difference is preprophase, an additional step in plant mitosis that results in formation of the preprophase band, a structure composed of microtubules. In mitotic prophase I of plants, this band disappears.
== Cell checkpoints ==
Prophase I in meiosis is the most complex iteration of prophase that occurs in both plant cells and animal cells. To ensure pairing of homologous chromosomes and recombination of genetic material occurs properly, there are cellular checkpoints in place. The meiotic checkpoint network is a DNA damage response system that controls double strand break repair, chromatin structure, and the movement and pairing of chromosomes. The system consists of multiple pathways (including the meiotic recombination checkpoint) that prevent the cell from entering metaphase I with errors due to recombination.

<text>An ensign is a maritime flag that is used for the national identification of a ship. It is the largest flag and is generally flown at the stern (rear) of the ship while in port. Depending on the ship&#x27;s origin, it may sometimes be identical with a jack on the bow of the ship when in a port. Jacks are more common on warships than on merchant ships.

==Etymology==
The Middle English is derived from the Latin word .

==Vexillology==
Vexillologists distinguish between three varieties of ensigns:
*A state ensign or government ensign (usage symbol ) is worn by government vessels of official government agencies or civilian equipped auxiliary ships.

*A naval ensign (usage symbol ) is worn by a country&#x27;s navy as a war flag for military ships. The term &quot;war flag&quot; is used irrespective of if a given country is at war. Large versions of naval ensigns called battle ensigns are used when a warship goes into battle. The ensign differs from the jack, which is additionally flown from a jackstaff at the bow of a vessel if they are at the port.

*A civil ensign (usage symbol ) is worn by merchant and pleasure vessels. The merchant maritime flag or civil ensign is, therefore, the specific flag for the Merchant navy of a country, unless the (private) owners are authorized to use another. The commercial flag was created to allow these private individuals to declare their nationality. Some countries have a specific yacht ensign for recreational boats without declared cargo, which differs from the regular ensign. Merchant flags can only be flown by ships that are not ships of war, ships of state, auxiliary ships or yachts. These ships do not represent an extraterritorial area, but rather belong to a private person or similar and thus do not represent the state itself. This means that the use of the national or even state flag is normally forbidden.

Some countries like the United States and France use just one flag as an ensign and also as a jack, while lacking special cantons and transparent identification. All ships of the seagoing services of the United States Government except for the United States Coast Guard fly the national flag as their ensign, although the ships of some agencies also fly an agency flag as a distinctive mark.

Countries like Ukraine, Italy, Russia, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Japan use different ensigns. These are strictly regulated and indicate if the vessel is a warship, a merchant ship, a ship under contract to carry mail, or a yacht, for example.

The national flags of several Commonwealth countries originated in the ensigns of the United Kingdom. Some of these national flags include those of Australia, New Zealand and several island nations. It is also very likely that the Grand Union Flag, from which the flag of the United States developed, was strongly influenced by either the British Red Ensign or the flag of the British East India Company.

==Usage==
In nautical use, every boat uses a flag belonging to a specific Nation to indicate its organizational membership. This flag signifies the home port of the ship owner and that taxes for ship-related income are paid there. Flagging out always means that the relevant laws of the country apply on the ship. This includes employment contracts, safety regulations, stamp duty or value-added taxes.

In most countries, especially in Europe and the countries of the Commonwealth of Nations, it is common for the ensign to display additional information, like whether it is a civil, state or military flag.

Ensigns are usually at the stern flagstaff when in port, and may be shifted to a gaff (if available) or mast amidships when the ship is under way, becoming known as a &quot;steaming ensign&quot;.

A boat flag is also often used as guest country flag and is flown on the boat when navigating in foreign waters or entering another country&#x27;s port.

==Air ensigns==
With the creation of independent air forces and the growth in civil aviation in the first half of the 20th century, a range of distinguishing flags and ensigns were adopted. These may be divided into air force ensigns (often light blue in color, such as the Royal Air Force Ensign) and civil air ensigns.

==Heraldic ensigns==
In heraldry, an ensign is an ornament or sign, such as the crown, coronet, or mitre, borne above the charge or arms.

<text>Kenya Airways Ltd., more commonly known as Kenya Airways, is the flag carrier airline of Kenya. The company was founded in 1977, after the dissolution of East African Airways. Its head office is located in Embakasi, Nairobi, with its hub at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.

The airline was owned by the Government of Kenya until April 1995, and it was privatised in 1996, becoming the first African flag carrier to successfully do so. Kenya Airways is currently a public-private partnership. The largest shareholder is the Government of Kenya (48.9%), with 38.1% being owned by KQ Lenders Company 2017 Ltd (in turn owned by a consortium of banks), followed by KLM, which has a 7.8% stake in the company. Private owners hold the rest of the shares; shares are traded on the Nairobi Stock Exchange, the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange, and the Uganda Securities Exchange.

The airline became a member of SkyTeam in June 2010 and is also a member of the African Airlines Association since 1977.

==History==
===Early years===
Kenya Airways was established by the Kenyan government on 22 January 1977, following the break-up of the East African Community and the consequent demise of East African Airways (EAA). On 4 February 1977, two Boeing 707-321s leased from British Midland Airways inaugurated operations, serving the Nairobi–Frankfurt–London route. On internal and regional flights, the carrier deployed aircraft formerly operated by the EAA consortium, such as one Douglas DC-9-52 and three Fokker F-27-200s. In late 1977, three Boeing 707s were acquired from Northwest Orient. The following year, the company formed a charter subsidiary named Kenya Flamingo Airlines, which leased aircraft from the parent airline in order to operate international passenger and cargo services. Aer Lingus provided the company with technical and management support in the early years.

===1980s–1990s: Expansion and privatisation===

In July 1980, the airline had 2100 employees and a fleet of three Boeing 707-320Bs, one Boeing 720B, one DC-9-30 and three Fokker F-27-200s. At this time, Addis Ababa, Athens, Bombay, Cairo, Copenhagen, Frankfurt, Jeddah, Kampala, Karachi, Khartoum, London, Lusaka, Mauritius, Mogadishu, Rome, Salisbury, Seychelles and Zürich were among the airline&#x27;s international destinations, whereas domestic routes radiated from Nairobi to Kisumu, Malindi, Mombasa and Mumias. A Nairobi–Bombay nonstop route was launched in 1982 using Boeing 707-320Bs. A year later, the company commenced serving Tanzania while flights to Burundi, Malawi and Rwanda were launched in 1984. Capacity on the European routes was boosted in November 1985 with the incorporation of an Airbus A310-200 leased from Condor. Kilimanjaro was first served in March 1986. That year, the airline ordered two Airbus A310-300s. Kenya Airways was the first African carrier to acquire the type and was the first wide-bodies ordered by the company. Funded with a loan, the delivery of these two aircraft took place in and September 1986. They flew on the Kenya–Europe corridor, and permitted Kenya Airways to return the A310-200 to the lessor. In early 1988, the carrier ordered two Fokker 50s; for domestic routes, the airline received the first of these aircraft at the end of the year. Also in 1988, the lease of a third A310-300 was arranged with the International Lease Finance for a ten-year period; the aircraft joined the fleet in November 1989. Leased from Ansett Worldwide, the first Boeing 757-200 was received in January 1990, whereas a third Fokker 50 was acquired in the same year. By late 1991, two Boeing 737-200s had been leased from Guinness Peat Aviation.
In 1986, &quot;Sessional Paper Number 1&quot; was published by the Government of Kenya, outlining the country&#x27;s need for economic development and growth. The document stressed the government&#x27;s opinion that the airline would be better off privately owned, thus resulting in the first privatisation attempt. The government named Philip Ndegwa as chairman of the board in 1991, with specific orders to make the airline a privately owned company. In 1992, the &quot;Public Enterprise Reform&quot; paper was published, giving Kenya Airways priority among national companies in Kenya to be privatised. Ndegwa was succeeded by Isaac Omolo Okero. In September 1992, Brian Davies was appointed as the new managing director of the company. Davies had been previously hired to carry out a study of viability on privatisation, working for British Airways&#x27; Speedwing consulting arm. Swissair was the first company to provide Kenya Airways with privatisation advice. In the fiscal year 1993 to 1994, the airline produced its first profit since the start of commercialisation. In 1994, the International Finance Corporation was appointed to assist in the privatisation process, which effectively began in 1995. A large aviation industry partner was sought to acquire 40% of the shares, with another 40% reserved for private investors and the government keeping the remaining stake. The government would absorb almost  million in debts and would convert another  million it provided in loans into equity; after reorganisation, the company would have a debt of approximately  million. British Airways, KLM, Lufthansa and South African Airways were among the airlines expressing interest in taking a stake in Kenya Airways.

KLM was awarded the privatisation of the company, which restructured its debts and made a master corporation agreement with KLM, which bought 26% of the shares, becoming the largest single shareholder since then. Shares were floated to the public in March 1996, and the airline started trading in the Nairobi Stock Exchange. The Government of Kenya kept a 23% stake in the company, and offered the remaining 51% to the public; however, non-Kenyan shareholders could hold a maximum 49% share of the airline. Despite 40% of the shares being kept by foreign investors following privatisation (including KLM 26% stake), top management positions were held by Kenyans. Following the takeover, the government of Kenya capitalised  million, while the airline was awarded a  million loan from the International Finance Corporation to modernise its fleet. In a deal worth  million, two Boeing 737-300s were ordered in July 1996.

===2000s–2010s===
In January 2000, the airline experienced its first fatal accident when an Airbus A310 that had been bought new in 1986 crashed off Ivory Coast, shortly after taking off from Abidjan. By the same year, the fleet consisted of four Airbus A310-300s, two Boeing 737-200 Advanced and four Boeing 737-300s. At this time the company had a staff of 2,780, including 400 engineers, 146 flight crew and 365 cabin crew. From its main hub at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, scheduled services were operated to Abidjan, Addis Ababa, Amsterdam, Bujumbura, Cairo, Copenhagen, Dar es Salaam, Douala, Dubai, Eldoret, Entebbe/Kampala, Harare, Johannesburg, Karachi, Khartoum, Kigali, Kinshasa, Lagos, Lilongwe, Lokichoggio, London, Lusaka, Mahe Island, Malindi, Mombasa, Mumbai, and Zanzibar. In 2002, an order for Boeing 777-200ERs was placed with Boeing; an additional aircraft of the type was acquired in November 2005. In March 2006, Boeing 787-8s were ordered; the first two examples would be delivered in and the rest in . The original Boeing 787 order was amended months later to include more aircraft of the type. The first Embraer 190 joined the fleet in December 2010.

In June 2012, the company announced the issuance of rights worth KSh.20 billion/=, aimed at increasing capital to support expansion plans. Following the allocation of shares, KLM increased their stake in the company from 26% to 26.73%, while the Kenyan government boosted their participation into the company from 23% to 29.8%, becoming the largest shareholder. In April 2012, the airline launched a plan named &quot;Project Mawingu&quot; (the Swahili word meaning &quot;Clouds&quot;) to add 24 destinations by 2021, including the start of services to Australia and North and South America, and expanding its presence in Asia as well. In October 2013, the airline stated that it will add six new destinations every year, following the delivery of Boeing 777s and 787s the carrier has on order.

Operational results for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 showed substantial losses. The rapid expansion of the fleet and routes (dubbed &quot;Project Mawingu&quot;) was cited as the primary cause of the downturn. Fuel-price hedging and the 1996 agreement with KLM, considered intrusive in the running of the flag carrier, took secondary blame. Corrective measures were taken to improve the financial and operational position of the airline and avert insolvency. 
The route partnership with KLM was deemed profitable thus, kept. However, the parties agreed to amend some features of the deal that hurt KQ -IATA code for Kenya Airways. Two Boeing B737-700 were sold and five newer, leased airliners were sub-leased to improve cash flow. Efforts to financially re-position the carrier were successful at the end of 2017. In a complex deal, stakeholders agreed to convert close to half a billion US dollars in equity loans, changing the ownership structure. The government of Kenya, the biggest lender, saw its holdings rise from 29.8% to 48.9% while that of KLM was diluted from 26.7% down to 7.8%. A consortium of local banks, through a special-purpose vehicle called: &quot;KQ Lenders Company 2017 Ltd.&quot;, ended up with 38.1%. The latter entity is obligated with a loan from the above local banks for US$225 million; this amount, in turn, is guaranteed by the government. The airline&#x27;s employees, through a shareholding scheme, and others own the remaining 5.2%. The Government of Kenya issued a guarantee for a further US$525 million debt owed to Import-Export Bank of the United States, financier of the newer Boeing planes of its fleet. 
In a bid to recover their exposure, syndicated leaseholders and banks unsuccessfully fought these measures to restructure the carrier&#x27;s ownership.

An outline of a plan to restore profitability was disclosed in a March 2018 interview given by the CEO and the chairman of the company. The turnaround operation will include route expansion, pursuing the high-end segment of the market, on partnerships and joint ventures with other airlines. The carrier plans to add up to twenty new destinations in Africa, Europe and Asia in the next five years. Five sub-leased aircraft are to re-join the fleet by the end of 2019 to facilitate this move. Preparations are underway to roll out an economy-plus class to target the business and high-end leisure travellers. Direct flights to luxury tourism destinations in the Indian Ocean are also planned. Talks are underway with South African Airways regarding route-sharing and aircraft-maintenance collaboration; this is the other focus of the turnaround scheme. In December 2018 Kenya Airways revealed plans to start flights between Nairobi and Windhoek, Namibia.

=== 2020s and the current state of recovery. ===
The airline announced plans to undergo a $1 billion restructuring in 2021 to help it recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Upon announcing major losses in 2022, the carrier announced plans to cut ties with the Kenyan government by the end of 2023.

In 2024, Kenya Airways has demonstrated a strong performance turnaround, marking its first profit since 2013, a significant milestone driven by its Project Kifaru strategy. This plan emphasizes operational excellence, financial discipline, and an enhanced customer experience. For the first half of the year ending June 2024, the airline reported a net profit of Ksh513 million, a major improvement from the Ksh21.7 billion loss reported during the same period last year The airline’s profit after tax saw a remarkable 102% improvement, highlighting the success of the ongoing recovery strategy. Passenger numbers grew by 10% to 2.54 million, with an expanded capacity leading to a revenue increase of 22% to Ksh91 billion, The airline’s capacity, measured in Available Seat Kilometers (ASKs), increased by 16% to 7.991 billion ASKs, while Revenue Passenger Kilometers (RPKs) improved by14%.though cost management remains a challenge as operating expenses rose alongside growth in service capacity.

== Kenya airways move towards sustainability ==
Kenya Airways (KQ) has launched three key sustainability initiatives under its strategic recovery plan, Project Kifaru, aimed at ensuring long-term business viability and environmental responsibility. These include:

# Pyro-Diesel Plant: Produces 700-1,000 liters of diesel daily, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, cutting fuel expenses, and lowering carbon emissions.
# Water Bottling Plant: Produces 4,500 liters daily, decreasing water procurement costs, enabling potential sales, and enhancing financial sustainability.
# Msafiri House Transformation: Converts a property into a centralized Operations Control Centre to streamline flight and fleet management, improve team collaboration, and reduce operational costs. It also adds training facilities to generate additional revenue.

These projects align with KQ&#x27;s goals of reducing its environmental footprint, improving operational efficiency, and fostering community development through job creation. CEO Allan Kilavuka emphasized the airline&#x27;s commitment to sustainability, customer focus, and Africa&#x27;s prosperity through responsible corporate practices.

Kenya Airways’ Water Bottling Plant, with a daily capacity of 4,500 liters, will &quot;reduce reliance on external suppliers and significantly lower water procurement costs while generating additional revenue through potential water sales.&quot; Similarly, the Pyro-Diesel Plant, producing 700–1,000 liters of diesel daily, &quot;will make a tangible impact on our operational costs, reducing fuel expenses and decreasing the environmental footprint of our ground operations,&quot; said George Kamal. These initiatives demonstrate Kenya Airways&#x27; dual commitment to sustainability and financial prudence. As Kamal emphasized, &quot;We are not just cutting costs for short-term gains; we are building a more resilient and sustainable future for Kenya Airways.&quot; Furthermore, the scaling up of these plants is expected to &quot;create additional employment opportunities,&quot; underscoring the airline&#x27;s dedication to community development and environmental responsibility.

<text>In mathematics, a quadric or quadric surface is a generalization of conic sections (ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas). In three-dimensional space, quadrics include ellipsoids, paraboloids, and hyperboloids. 

More generally, a quadric hypersurface (of dimension &quot;D&quot;) embedded in a higher dimensional space (of dimension ) is defined as the zero set of an irreducible polynomial of degree two in variables; for example, &quot;D&quot;1 is the case of conic sections (plane curves). When the defining polynomial is not absolutely irreducible, the zero set is generally not considered a quadric, although it is often called a &quot;degenerate quadric&quot; or a &quot;reducible quadric&quot;.

A quadric is an affine algebraic variety, or, if it is reducible, an affine algebraic set. Quadrics may also be defined in projective spaces; see , below.

==Formulation==
In coordinates , the general quadric is thus defined by the algebraic equation
:formula_1

which may be compactly written in vector and matrix notation as:

:formula_2

where is a row vector, &quot;x&quot;T is the transpose of &quot;x&quot; (a column vector), &quot;Q&quot; is a matrix and &quot;P&quot; is a -dimensional row vector and &quot;R&quot; a scalar constant. The values &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;P&quot; and &quot;R&quot; are often taken to be over real numbers or complex numbers, but a quadric may be defined over any field.

== Euclidean plane ==
As the dimension of a Euclidean plane is two, quadrics in a Euclidean plane have dimension one and are thus plane curves. They are called &quot;conic sections&quot;, or &quot;conics&quot;.
== Euclidean space ==
In three-dimensional Euclidean space, quadrics have dimension two, and are known as quadric surfaces. Their quadratic equations have the form
:formula_3
where formula_4 are real numbers, and at least one of , , and is nonzero.

The quadric surfaces are classified and named by their shape, which corresponds to the orbits under affine transformations. That is, if an affine transformation maps a quadric onto another one, they belong to the same class, and share the same name and many properties.

The principal axis theorem shows that for any (possibly reducible) quadric, a suitable change of Cartesian coordinates or, equivalently, a Euclidean transformation allows putting the equation of the quadric into a unique simple form on which the class of the quadric is immediately visible. This form is called the normal form of the equation, since two quadrics have the same normal form if and only if there is a Euclidean transformation that maps one quadric to the other. The normal forms are as follows:
:formula_5
:formula_6
:formula_7
:formula_8
where the formula_9 are either 1, –1 or 0, except formula_10 which takes only the value 0 or 1.

Each of these 17 normal forms corresponds to a single orbit under affine transformations. In three cases there are no real points: formula_11 (&quot;imaginary ellipsoid&quot;), formula_12 (&quot;imaginary elliptic cylinder&quot;), and formula_13 (pair of complex conjugate parallel planes, a reducible quadric). In one case, the &quot;imaginary cone&quot;, there is a single point (formula_14). If formula_15 one has a line (in fact two complex conjugate intersecting planes). For formula_16 one has two intersecting planes (reducible quadric). For formula_17 one has a double plane. For formula_18 one has two parallel planes (reducible quadric).

Thus, among the 17 normal forms, there are nine true quadrics: a cone, three cylinders (often called degenerate quadrics) and five non-degenerate quadrics (ellipsoid, paraboloids and hyperboloids), which are detailed in the following tables. The eight remaining quadrics are the imaginary ellipsoid (no real point), the imaginary cylinder (no real point), the imaginary cone (a single real point), and the reducible quadrics, which are decomposed in two planes; there are five such decomposed quadrics, depending whether the planes are distinct or not, parallel or not, real or complex conjugate.

When two or more of the parameters of the canonical equation are equal, one obtains a quadric of revolution, which remains invariant when rotated around an axis (or infinitely many axes, in the case of the sphere).

==Definition and basic properties==
An &quot;affine quadric&quot; is the set of zeros of a polynomial of degree two. When not specified otherwise, the polynomial is supposed to have real coefficients, and the zeros are points in a Euclidean space. However, most properties remain true when the coefficients belong to any field and the points belong in an affine space. As usual in algebraic geometry, it is often useful to consider points over an algebraically closed field containing the polynomial coefficients, generally the complex numbers, when the coefficients are real.

Many properties becomes easier to state (and to prove) by extending the quadric to the projective space by projective completion, consisting of adding points at infinity. Technically, if
:formula_19
is a polynomial of degree two that defines an affine quadric, then its projective completion is defined by homogenizing into
:formula_20
(this is a polynomial, because the degree of is two). The points of the projective completion are the points of the projective space whose projective coordinates are zeros of .

So, a &quot;projective quadric&quot; is the set of zeros in a projective space of a homogeneous polynomial of degree two.

As the above process of homogenization can be reverted by setting :
:formula_21
it is often useful to not distinguish an affine quadric from its projective completion, and to talk of the &quot;affine equation&quot; or the &quot;projective equation&quot; of a quadric. However, this is not a perfect equivalence; it is generally the case that formula_22 will include points with formula_23, which are not also solutions of formula_24 because these points in projective space correspond to points &quot;at infinity&quot; in affine space.

===Equation===
A quadric in an affine space of dimension is the set of zeros of a polynomial of degree 2. That is, it is the set of the points whose coordinates satisfy an equation
:formula_25
where the polynomial has the form
:formula_26
for a matrix formula_27 with formula_28 and formula_29 running from 0 to formula_30. When the characteristic of the field of the coefficients is not two, generally formula_31 is assumed; equivalently formula_32. When the characteristic of the field of the coefficients is two, generally formula_33 is assumed when formula_34; equivalently formula_35 is upper triangular.

The equation may be shortened, as the matrix equation
:formula_36
with
:formula_37
The equation of the projective completion is almost identical:
:formula_38
with
:formula_39

These equations define a quadric as an algebraic hypersurface of dimension and degree two in a space of dimension .

A quadric is said to be non-degenerate if the matrix formula_35 is invertible.

A non-degenerate quadric is non-singular in the sense that its projective completion has no singular point (a cylinder is non-singular in the affine space, but it is a degenerate quadric that has a singular point at infinity).

The singular points of a degenerate quadric are the points whose projective coordinates belong to the null space of the matrix .

A quadric is reducible if and only if the rank of is one (case of a double hyperplane) or two (case of two hyperplanes).

==Normal form of projective quadrics==
In real projective space, by Sylvester&#x27;s law of inertia, a non-singular quadratic form &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) may be put into the normal form

:formula_41

by means of a suitable projective transformation (normal forms for singular quadrics can have zeros as well as ±1 as coefficients). For two-dimensional surfaces (dimension &quot;D&quot; = 2) in three-dimensional space, there are exactly three non-degenerate cases:

:formula_42

The first case is the empty set.

The second case generates the ellipsoid, the elliptic paraboloid or the hyperboloid of two sheets, depending on whether the chosen plane at infinity cuts the quadric in the empty set, in a point, or in a nondegenerate conic respectively. These all have positive Gaussian curvature.

The third case generates the hyperbolic paraboloid or the hyperboloid of one sheet, depending on whether the plane at infinity cuts it in two lines, or in a nondegenerate conic respectively. These are doubly ruled surfaces of negative Gaussian curvature.

The degenerate form
:formula_43
generates the elliptic cylinder, the parabolic cylinder, the hyperbolic cylinder, or the cone, depending on whether the plane at infinity cuts it in a point, a line, two lines, or a nondegenerate conic respectively. These are singly ruled surfaces of zero Gaussian curvature.

We see that projective transformations don&#x27;t mix Gaussian curvatures of different sign. This is true for general surfaces.

In complex projective space all of the nondegenerate quadrics become indistinguishable from each other.

==Rational parametrization==
Given a non-singular point of a quadric, a line passing through is either tangent to the quadric, or intersects the quadric in exactly one other point (as usual, a line contained in the quadric is considered as a tangent, since it is contained in the tangent hyperplane). This means that the lines passing through and not tangent to the quadric are in one to one correspondence with the points of the quadric that do not belong to the tangent hyperplane at . Expressing the points of the quadric in terms of the direction of the corresponding line provides parametric equations of the following forms.

In the case of conic sections (quadric curves), this parametrization establishes a bijection between a projective conic section and a projective line; this bijection is an isomorphism of algebraic curves. In higher dimensions, the parametrization defines a birational map, which is a bijection between dense open subsets of the quadric and a projective space of the same dimension (the topology that is considered is the usual one in the case of a real or complex quadric, or the Zariski topology in all cases). The points of the quadric that are not in the image of this bijection are the points of intersection of the quadric and its tangent hyperplane at .

In the affine case, the parametrization is a rational parametrization of the form
:formula_44
where formula_45 are the coordinates of a point of the quadric, formula_46 are parameters, and formula_47 are polynomials of degree at most two.

In the projective case, the parametrization has the form 
:formula_48
where formula_49 are the projective coordinates of a point of the quadric, formula_50 are parameters, and formula_51 are homogeneous polynomials of degree two.

One passes from one parametrization to the other by putting formula_52 and formula_53 
:formula_54

For computing the parametrization and proving that the degrees are as asserted, one may proceed as follows in the affine case. One can proceed similarly in the projective case.

Let be the quadratic polynomial that defines the quadric, and formula_55 be the coordinate vector of the given point of the quadric (so, formula_56 Let formula_57 be the coordinate vector of the point of the quadric to be parametrized, and formula_58 be a vector defining the direction used for the parametrization (directions whose last coordinate is zero are not taken into account here; this means that some points of the affine quadric are not parametrized; one says often that they are parametrized by points at infinity in the space of parameters) . The points of the intersection of the quadric and the line of direction formula_59 passing through formula_60 are the points formula_61 such that
:formula_62
for some value of the scalar formula_63 This is an equation of degree two in formula_64 except for the values of formula_59 such that the line is tangent to the quadric (in this case, the degree is one if the line is not included in the quadric, or the equation becomes formula_66 otherwise). The coefficients of formula_67 and formula_68 are respectively of degree at most one and two in formula_69 As the constant coefficient is formula_70 the equation becomes linear by dividing by formula_64 and its unique solution is the quotient of a polynomial of degree at most one by a polynomial of degree at most two. Substituting this solution into the expression of formula_72 one obtains the desired parametrization as fractions of polynomials of degree at most two.

===Example: circle and spheres===

Let consider the quadric of equation
:formula_73
For formula_74 this is the unit circle; for formula_75 this is the unit sphere; in higher dimensions, this is the unit hypersphere.

The point formula_76 belongs to the quadric (the choice of this point among other similar points is only a question of convenience). So, the equation formula_62 of the preceding section becomes
:formula_78
By expanding the squares, simplifying the constant terms, dividing by formula_64 and solving in formula_64 one obtains
:formula_81
Substituting this into formula_61 and simplifying the expression of the last coordinate, one obtains the parametric equation
:formula_83

By homogenizing, one obtains the projective parametrization
:formula_84

A straightforward verification shows that this induces a bijection between the points of the quadric such that formula_85 and the points such that formula_86 in the projective space of the parameters. On the other hand, all values of formula_87 such that formula_88 and formula_89 give the point formula_90

In the case of conic sections (formula_91), there is exactly one point with formula_92 and one has a bijection between the circle and the projective line.

For formula_93 there are many points with formula_94 and thus many parameter values for the point formula_90 On the other hand, the other points of the quadric for which formula_96 (and thus formula_97) cannot be obtained for any value of the parameters. These points are the points of the intersection of the quadric and its tangent plane at formula_90 In this specific case, these points have nonreal complex coordinates, but it suffices to change one sign in the equation of the quadric for producing real points that are not obtained with the resulting parametrization.

==Rational points==
A quadric is &quot;defined over&quot; a field formula_99 if the coefficients of its equation belong to formula_100 When formula_99 is the field formula_102 of the rational numbers, one can suppose that the coefficients are integers by clearing denominators.

A point of a quadric defined over a field formula_99 is said rational over formula_99 if its coordinates belong to formula_100 A rational point over the field formula_106 of the real numbers, is called a real point.

A rational point over formula_102 is called simply a &quot;rational point&quot;. By clearing denominators, one can suppose and one supposes generally that the projective coordinates of a rational point (in a quadric defined over formula_102) are integers. Also, by clearing denominators of the coefficients, one supposes generally that all the coefficients of the equation of the quadric and the polynomials occurring in the parametrization are integers.

Finding the rational points of a projective quadric amounts thus to solving a Diophantine equation.

Given a rational point over a quadric over a field , the parametrization described in the preceding section provides rational points when the parameters are in , and, conversely, every rational point of the quadric can be obtained from parameters in , if the point is not in the tangent hyperplane at .

It follows that, if a quadric has a rational point, it has many other rational points (infinitely many if is infinite), and these points can be algorithmically generated as soon one knows one of them.

As said above, in the case of projective quadrics defined over formula_109 the parametrization takes the form
:formula_110
where the formula_111 are homogeneous polynomials of degree two with integer coefficients. Because of the homogeneity, one can consider only parameters that are setwise coprime integers. If formula_112 is the equation of the quadric, a solution of this equation is said &quot;primitive&quot; if its components are setwise coprime integers. The primitive solutions are in one to one correspondence with the rational points of the quadric (up to a change of sign of all components of the solution). The non-primitive integer solutions are obtained by multiplying primitive solutions by arbitrary integers; so they do not deserve a specific study. However, setwise coprime parameters can produce non-primitive solutions, and one may have to divide by a greatest common divisor to arrive at the associated primitive solution.

===Pythagorean triples===
This is well illustrated by Pythagorean triples. A Pythagorean triple is a triple formula_113 of positive integers such that formula_114 A Pythagorean triple is &quot;primitive&quot; if formula_115 are setwise coprime, or, equivalently, if any of the three pairs formula_116 formula_117 and formula_118 is coprime.

By choosing formula_119 the above method provides the parametrization
:formula_120 
for the quadric of equation formula_121 (The names of variables and parameters are being changed from the above ones to those that are common when considering Pythagorean triples).

If and are coprime integers such that formula_122 the resulting triple is a Pythagorean triple. If one of and is even and the other is odd, this resulting triple is primitive; otherwise, and are both odd, and one obtains a primitive triple by dividing by 2.

In summary, the primitive Pythagorean triples with formula_123 even are obtained as
:formula_124 
with and coprime integers such that one is even and formula_125 (this is Euclid&#x27;s formula). The primitive Pythagorean triples with formula_123 odd are obtained as
:formula_127
with and coprime odd integers such that formula_128

As the exchange of and transforms a Pythagorean triple into another Pythagorean triple, only one of the two cases is sufficient for producing all primitive Pythagorean triples up to the order of and .

== Projective quadrics over fields ==

The definition of a projective quadric in a real projective space (see above) can be formally adapted by defining a projective quadric in an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional projective space over a field. In order to omit dealing with coordinates, a projective quadric is usually defined by starting with a quadratic form on a vector space.

===Quadratic form===
Let formula_129 be a field and formula_130 a vector space over formula_129. A mapping formula_132 from formula_130 to formula_129 such that

: (Q1) formula_135 for any formula_136 and formula_137.

: (Q2) formula_138 is a bilinear form.
is called quadratic form. The bilinear form formula_139 is symmetric&quot;.&quot;

In case of formula_140 the bilinear form is formula_141, i.e. formula_139 and formula_132 are mutually determined in a unique way.
In case of formula_144 (that means: formula_145) the bilinear form has the property formula_146, i.e. formula_139 is
&quot;symplectic&quot;.

For formula_148 and formula_149
(formula_150 is a base of formula_130) formula_152 has the familiar form
: formula_153 and

: formula_154.

For example:

: formula_155

=== &quot;n&quot;-dimensional projective space over a field ===
Let formula_129 be a field, formula_157,
:formula_158 an -dimensional vector space over the field formula_159
:formula_160 the 1-dimensional subspace generated by formula_161,
: formula_162 the &quot;set of points&quot; ,
: formula_163 the &quot;set of lines&quot;.
:formula_164 is the -dimensional projective space over formula_129.
:The set of points contained in a formula_166-dimensional subspace of formula_167 is a &quot;formula_168-dimensional subspace&quot; of formula_169. A 2-dimensional subspace is a &quot;plane&quot;.
:In case of formula_170 a formula_171-dimensional subspace is called &quot;hyperplane&quot;.

=== Projective quadric ===
A quadratic form formula_132 on a vector space formula_158 defines a &quot;quadric&quot; formula_174 in the associated projective space formula_175 as the set of the points formula_176 such that formula_177. That is,
: formula_178

Examples in formula_179.:
(E1): For formula_180 one obtains a conic.
(E2): For formula_181 one obtains the pair of lines with the equations formula_182 and formula_183, respectively. They intersect at point formula_184;

For the considerations below it is assumed that formula_185.

=== Polar space ===
For point formula_186 the set
: formula_187
is called polar space of formula_188 (with respect to formula_132).

If formula_190 for all formula_191, one obtains formula_192.

If formula_193 for at least one formula_191, the equation formula_190is a non trivial linear equation which defines a hyperplane. Hence

:formula_196 is either a hyperplane or formula_197.

=== Intersection with a line ===
For the intersection of an arbitrary line formula_198 with a quadric formula_199, the following cases may occur:
:a) formula_200 and formula_198 is called &quot;exterior line&quot;
:b) formula_202 and formula_198 is called a &quot;line in the quadric&quot;
:c) formula_204 and formula_198 is called &quot;tangent line&quot;
:d) formula_206 and formula_198 is called &quot;secant line&quot;.

Proof:
Let formula_198 be a line, which intersects formula_209 at point formula_210 and formula_211 is a second point on formula_198.
From formula_213 one obtains
formula_214
I) In case of formula_215 the equation formula_216 holds and it is
formula_217 for any formula_218. Hence either formula_219
for &quot;any&quot; formula_218 or formula_221 for &quot;any&quot; formula_218, which proves b) and b&#x27;).
II) In case of formula_223 one obtains formula_224 and the equation
formula_225 has exactly one solution formula_226.
Hence: formula_227, which proves c).

Additionally the proof shows:
:A line formula_198 through a point formula_229 is a &quot;tangent&quot; line if and only if formula_230.

=== &quot;f&quot;-radical, &quot;q&quot;-radical ===
In the classical cases formula_231 or formula_232 there exists only one radical, because of formula_140 and formula_139 and formula_132 are closely connected. In case of formula_144 the quadric formula_174 is not determined by formula_139 (see above) and so one has to deal with two radicals:

:a) formula_239 is a projective subspace. formula_240 is called &quot;f&quot;-radical of quadric formula_174.
:b) formula_242 is called singular radical or &quot;formula_132-radical&quot; of formula_174.
:c) In case of formula_140 one has formula_246.

A quadric is called non-degenerate if formula_247.

Examples in formula_179 (see above):
(E1): For formula_180 (conic) the bilinear form is
formula_250
In case of formula_140 the polar spaces are never formula_252. Hence formula_253.
In case of formula_144 the bilinear form is reduced to
formula_255 and formula_256. Hence formula_257
In this case the &quot;f&quot;-radical is the common point of all tangents, the so called &quot;knot&quot;.
In both cases formula_258 and the quadric (conic) ist &quot;non-degenerate&quot;.
(E2): For formula_181 (pair of lines) the bilinear form is formula_260 and formula_261 the intersection point. 
In this example the quadric is &quot;degenerate&quot;.

=== Symmetries ===
A quadric is a rather homogeneous object:

:For any point formula_262 there exists an involutorial central collineation formula_263 with center formula_188 and formula_265.

Proof:
Due to formula_266 the polar space formula_196 is a hyperplane.

The linear mapping

: formula_268

induces an &quot;involutorial central collineation&quot; formula_263 with axis formula_196 and centre formula_188 which leaves formula_174 invariant.
In the case of formula_140, the mapping formula_274 produces the familiar shape formula_275 with formula_276 and formula_277 for any formula_278.

Remark:
:a) An exterior line, a tangent line or a secant line is mapped by the involution formula_263 on an exterior, tangent and secant line, respectively.
:b) formula_280 is pointwise fixed by formula_263.

===&quot;q&quot;-subspaces and index of a quadric ===
A subspace formula_282 of formula_169 is called formula_132-subspace if formula_285

For example: points on a sphere or lines on a hyperboloid (s. below).

:Any two &quot;maximal&quot; formula_132-subspaces have the same dimension formula_287.

Let be formula_287 the dimension of the maximal formula_132-subspaces of formula_174 then
:The integer formula_291 is called index of formula_174.

Theorem: (BUEKENHOUT)
:For the index formula_28 of a non-degenerate quadric formula_174 in formula_169 the following is true:
::formula_296.

Let be formula_174 a non-degenerate quadric in formula_298, and formula_28 its index.
: In case of formula_300 quadric formula_174 is called &quot;sphere&quot; (or oval conic if formula_91).
: In case of formula_303 quadric formula_174 is called &quot;hyperboloid&quot; (of one sheet).

Examples:
:a) Quadric formula_174 in formula_306 with form formula_180 is non-degenerate with index 1.
:b) If polynomial formula_308 is irreducible over formula_129 the quadratic form formula_310 gives rise to a non-degenerate quadric formula_174 in formula_312 of index 1 (sphere). For example: formula_313 is irreducible over formula_106 (but not over formula_315 !).
:c) In formula_312 the quadratic form formula_317 generates a &quot;hyperboloid&quot;.

=== Generalization of quadrics: quadratic sets ===
It is not reasonable to formally extend the definition of quadrics to spaces over genuine skew fields (division rings). Because one would obtain secants bearing more than 2 points of the quadric which is totally different from &quot;usual&quot; quadrics. The reason is the following statement.

:A division ring formula_129 is commutative if and only if any equation formula_319, has at most two solutions.

There are &quot;generalizations&quot; of quadrics: quadratic sets. A quadratic set is a set of points of a projective space with the same geometric properties as a quadric: every line intersects a quadratic set in at most two points or is contained in the set.

<text>Richard Dixon Oldham FRS (; 31 July 1858 – 15 July 1936) was a British geologist who made the first clear identification of the separate arrivals of P-waves, S-waves and surface waves on seismograms and the first clear evidence that the Earth has a central core.

==Life==

Born on 31 July 1858 to Thomas Oldham, a Fellow of the Royal Society and geologist, Oldham was educated at Rugby School and the Royal School of Mines.
In 1879 Oldham became an assistant-superintendent with the Geological Survey of India, working in the Himalayas. He wrote about 40 publications for the Survey on geological subjects including hot springs, the geology of the Son Valley and the structure of the Himalayas and the Ganges plain. His most famous work was in seismology. His report on the 1897 Assam earthquake went far beyond reports of previous earthquakes. It included a description of the Chedrang fault, with uplift up to 35 feet and reported accelerations of the ground that had exceeded the Earth&#x27;s gravitational acceleration. He also included accounts of earth-waves that could be seen travelling across the plain, and of waterspouts. During the cold season following the earthquake, the Survey carried out a re-triangulation of part of the area that had been initially surveyed in 1860. They found displacements of up to 12 feet both in distances and heights, substantially larger than could be due to errors. This was one of the earliest reports of such a re-survey.
Oldham&#x27;s most important contribution to seismology was the first clear identification of the separate arrivals of different groups of waves, as detected by seismograms at distant locations. In the report of the 1897 earthquake he presented data, mainly from stations in Italy, that showed three phases. The first to arrive, the P or Primary waves, were compression waves, which he referred to as condensational. Next came the S or Secondary waves, with lateral movement, which he referred to as distortional. The third phase was of large undulations. The times of arrival of these phases indicated that the first two had travelled through the body of the earth, while the third were surface waves. Since these observations agreed with theory for elastic waves, they showed that the Earth could be treated as elastic in studies of seismic waves.

In subsequent papers, Oldham compared data from numerous earthquakes, with seismic observations at different distances from the epicentre. He found a discontinuity in the travel times for the S-waves at about 120° angular distance from the earthquake, suggesting refraction by a dense core with a diameter of about 0.4 that of the earth. Oldham was not the first to suggest that the earth had a dense core, but he provided the first direct evidence of its existence and size.

In 1903, Oldham resigned from the GSI due to ill-health and returned to the United Kingdom, living in Kew and various parts of Wales. He continued to be active in the field, publishing papers on earthquakes in Guatemala and California.

In 1908 Oldham was awarded the Lyell Medal, in 1911 made a Fellow of the Royal Society, and from 1920 to 1922 served as the President of the Geological Society of London. Later in his life he became interested in the geography and history of the Rhône delta. He died on 15 July 1936.

<text>Inge Lehmann (13 May 1888 – 21 February 1993) was a Danish seismologist and geophysicist who is known for her discovery in 1936 of the solid inner core that exists within the molten outer core of the Earth. The seismic discontinuity in the speed of seismic waves at depths between 190 and 250 km is named the Lehmann discontinuity after her. Lehmann is considered to be a pioneer among women and scientists in seismology research.

==Early life and education==
Inge Lehmann was born on 13 May 1888 and grew up in Østerbro, a part of Copenhagen, Denmark. Her mother, Ida Sophie Tørsleff, was a housewife; her father was experimental psychologist Alfred Georg Ludvik Lehmann (1858–1921), a pioneer in the study of experimental psychology in Denmark. The Lehmann family had its roots in Bohemia; the Danish branch included barristers, politicians and engineers. Inge Lehmann&#x27;s paternal grandfather laid out the first Danish telegraph line (1854) and her great-grandfather was Governor of the National Bank. Her mother&#x27;s father, Hans Jakob Torsleff, belonged to an old Danish family with a priest in every generation. Members of the Tørsleff family were well-known public leaders and activists in the women&#x27;s rights movement. Inge&#x27;s cousins were the Minister of Trade, the chair of the Danish Women&#x27;s Society, and the leader of the Danish Girl Scouts. Her younger sister Signe, who was a single mother, rose to popularity as a school superintendent.

Lehmann&#x27;s parents enrolled both her and her sister at Fællesskolen in 1904, a liberal and progressive school that offered the same curriculum to both boys and girls, a practice uncommon at the time. This was unusual as most schools at the time separated boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; education. The principles of gender isolation went much deeper for girls who were education-oriented. It was thought to be damaging to expose girls to mental exhaustion throughout puberty. Males were believed to be more biologically adapted for such activities and therefore, allowed to take the high school entrance exam and start upper-secondary education (high school) at 15 years old, whereas females were not allowed to do so. This policy remained in effect until 1903.

This school was led by Hanna Adler, Niels Bohr&#x27;s aunt, a pioneering woman scholar and firm believer in gender equality. A year after earning her degree, Adler launched her school, inspired by innovative teaching practices in the US. Many of her female co-graduates, who were not eligible for many of the positions accessible to their male peers, were hired by Adler to teach. Women were prohibited from working in universities at the time, and the vast majority of female college graduates searched for employment as elementary schoolteachers despite obtaining degrees that allowed them to teach at the upper-secondary (high school) level. Lehmann credited her father and Hanna Adler as the most significant influences on her intellectual development.

At age 18, Lehmann achieved a first rank mark in the entrance exam for Copenhagen University. In 1907, she started her studies in mathematics, chemistry and physics at the University of Copenhagen. She continued her studies of mathematics in Cambridge from 1910 to 1911 at Newnham College. There, Lehmann faced gender-based adversities, not being allowed to fully participate in her studies, nor to achieve higher positions of education. As a result, Lehmann had a mental breakdown during her first year in 1911, and in 1912 returned to Denmark. Lehmann served as an actuarial assistant from 1911 to 1918 without attending school. She developed good computational skills in an actuary office she worked in for a few years until she resumed her studies at Copenhagen University in 1918. She completed the candidata magisterii degree in physical science and mathematics in two years, graduating in 1920. This was significant, since this degree was mostly given to male students. After a short period of time, studying mathematics at the University of Hamburg, in 1923 she accepted a position at Copenhagen University as an assistant to J.F. Steffensen, the professor of actuarial science.

Lehmann had a younger sister, Harriet, who became an actress. Inge Lehmann lived by herself all her adult life. She broke off an engagement in March 1917 and decided to remain unmarried, in order to pursue an academic career, which was not an unusual choice at the time.

Lehmann once complained to her nephew Niels Groes about the incompetence of her male colleagues, and wrote him: &quot;You should know how many incompetent men I had to compete with—in vain.&quot;

==Career==
In 1925, Lehmann was assigned to be the assistant of seismologist Niels Erik Nørlund. She took an interest in his field, and she began studying it on her own. She was chosen as a delegate for Denmark to attend the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics in 1927—a role she filled another eight times over the next forty years. By 1928, Lehmann obtained a &quot;magister scientiarum&quot; in seismology, and she was appointed head of the Geodætisk Institut&#x27;s seismological department the same year. In this position, she was responsible for overseeing the operation of three seismographic observatories, two of which were in Greenland. She personally operated the one in Copenhagen, producing reports based on its readings. Though it was not part of her job, Lehmann also engaged in research at the facility.

In 1929, Lehmann studied the Murchison earthquake which struck on the South Island of New Zealand. She analyzed the seismic data from the earthquake and noticed that there were waves of significant amplitude recorded in the Russian cities of Sverdlovsk and Irkutsk, both unexpected locations. Lehmann noticed after reviewing the data from the earthquakes that there were waves emanating from the earthquakes, which were called seismic waves. They were unexpected locations due to the theory that S-waves and some P-waves are deflected by the core creating a shadow area in which waves are not able to pass through. The waves seemed to pass through that area to reach Russia. This led to her discovering that there is a spherical core of solid material at the Earth&#x27;s centre.

Lehmann was the first to interpret P-wave arrivals as reflections from an inner core. Lehmann observed seismic waves from earthquakes, leading her to hypothesize that the Earth&#x27;s core consisted of two parts: &quot;a solid metal core surrounded by an outer liquid core, overturning the accepted theory of an entirely liquid core&quot;. She published these findings in a paper titled &quot;&quot; (1936), Prior to 1936, scientists believed that the Earth&#x27;s core was a single, massive molten sphere. However, many global observations did not analytically add up until Lehmann reached the heart of the issue. The theory she developed was that the Earth consisted of 3 shells: the mantle, outer core and inner core. Lehmann inferred that the core wasn&#x27;t homogeneous; rather, there is a smaller core that exists that is surrounded by the outer core. She deduced that waves travel faster in the smaller core, but the waves can be reflected off if it arrived tangentially. Her theory allows for another wave deflection at the extra boundary and this accounts for the direction and location in which the waves emerge. Other leading seismologists of the time, such as Beno Gutenberg, Charles Richter, and Harold Jeffreys, adopted this interpretation within two or three years, but it took until 1971 for the interpretation to be shown correct by computer calculations. She continued her work during World War II, though international collaboration was limited.

When American geologist Maurice Ewing visited her station in 1951, he invited Lehmann to work at the Lamont Geological Observatory, now called the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, that he ran at Columbia University. She was invited there to study the seismic wave &#x27;Lg&#x27;, which was a new seismic wave being researched by Maurice Ewing and Professor Frank Press. She studied there for a few months in 1952, after her retirement from the Royal Geodetic Institute.

She retired from her position as head of the Geodætisk Institut&#x27;s seismological department in 1953, giving her more time to conduct research over the following decades. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Lehmann traveled to North America several times and visited different seismological observatories throughout the United States and Canada. She became a prominent member of the community at the University of California, Berkeley, one of her most frequent stops. During the 1960s, Lehmann was able to explore more of the Earth using new technologies made specifically for detecting nuclear bombs during the Cold War.

While in the United States, Lehmann collaborated with Maurice Ewing and Frank Press on investigations of the Earth&#x27;s crust and upper mantle. During this work, she discovered another seismic discontinuity, which is a step-change increase in the speed of seismic waves at depths between 190 and 250 km. This discontinuity was named the Lehmann discontinuity after her. Francis Birch noted that the &quot;Lehmann discontinuity was discovered through exacting scrutiny of seismic records by a master of a black art for which no amount of computerization is likely to be a complete substitute.&quot;

Lehmann was also involved in the creation of the International Seismological Centre from 1961 to 1967.

==Awards, honours, and legacy==
Lehmann&#x27;s discoveries continue to play a vital role in geophysics. Her groundbreaking work provided the basis for modern seismic imaging techniques, which have become essential for exploring Earth&#x27;s interior and monitoring nuclear tests. The seismic discontinuities she identified, including the Lehmann discontinuity, have been key to advancing our understanding of Earth&#x27;s thermal history. Decades after her passing, her contributions remain a cornerstone of geophysical research.

Lehmann received many honours for her scientific achievements, among them are

* the Harry Oscar Wood Award in 1960, 
* the Emil Wiechert Medal in 1964, 
* the Gold Medal of the Danish Royal Society of Science and Letters 1965,
* the Tagea Brandt Rejselegat in 1938 and 1967, 
* her election as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1969, 
* the William Bowie Medal in 1971, which she was the first woman to ever win the award, and 
* the Medal of the Seismological Society of America in 1977. 
* honorary doctorates from Columbia University in 1964 and from the University of Copenhagen in 1968, as well as numerous honorific memberships.

Lehmann was also elected to the fellowship of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1936, and later became an Associate of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1957.

Because of her contribution to geological science, in 1996, the American Geophysical Union established the annual Inge Lehmann Medal to honour &quot;outstanding contributions to the understanding of the structure, composition, and dynamics of the Earth&#x27;s mantle and core.&quot; The medal has been given out annually ever since, and includes a portrait of Lehmann on the front.

The asteroid 5632 Ingelehmann was named in Lehmann&#x27;s honour. In 2015, a species of beetle was named after her on the hundredth anniversary of women&#x27;s suffrage in Denmark:&quot;Globicornis (Hadrotoma) ingelehmannae&quot;. In the same year, on the 127th anniversary of her birth, Google dedicated its worldwide Google Doodle to Lehmann.

A memorial dedicated to Lehmann was installed on Frue Plads in Copenhagen on 15 May 2017, designed by Danish artist, Elisabeth Toubro. The monument consists of a 8.8 m tall black diabase and patinated bronze. It is one of six portrait busts stood in front of the University of Copenhagen.

She will appear on a 2028 Danish krone banknote.

<text>DEF CON (also written as DEFCON, Defcon, or DC) is a hacker convention held annually in Las Vegas, Nevada. The first DEF CON took place in June 1993 and today many attendees at DEF CON include computer security professionals, journalists, lawyers, federal government employees, security researchers, students, and hackers with a general interest in software, computer architecture, hardware modification, conference badges, and anything else that can be &quot;hacked&quot;. The event consists of several tracks of speakers about computer and hacking-related subjects, as well as cyber-security challenges and competitions (known as hacking wargames). Contests held during the event are extremely varied and can range from creating the longest Wi-Fi connection to finding the most effective way to cool a beer in the Nevada heat.

Other contests, past and present, include lockpicking, robotics-related contests, art, slogan, coffee wars, scavenger hunt, and Capture the Flag. Capture the Flag (CTF) is perhaps the best known of these contests and is a hacking competition where teams of hackers attempt to attack and defend computers and networks using software and network structures. CTF has been emulated at other hacking conferences as well as in academic and military contexts (as red team exercises).

Federal law enforcement agents from the FBI, DoD, United States Postal Inspection Service, DHS (via CISA) and other agencies regularly attend DEF CON. Some have considered DEF CON to be the &quot;world&#x27;s largest&quot; hacker conference given its attendee size and the number of other conferences modeling themselves after it.

== History ==
DEF CON was founded in 1993, by then 18-year-old Jeff Moss as a farewell party for his friend, a fellow hacker and member of &quot;Platinum Net&quot;, a FidoNet protocol based hacking network from Canada. The party was planned for Las Vegas a few days before his friend was to leave the United States, because his father had accepted employment out of the country. However, his friend&#x27;s father left early, taking his friend along, so Jeff was left alone with the entire party planned. Jeff decided to invite all his hacker friends to go to Las Vegas with him and have the party with them instead. Hacker friends from far and wide got together and laid the foundation for DEF CON, with roughly 100 people in attendance.

The term DEF CON comes from the movie &quot;WarGames&quot;, referencing the U.S. Armed Forces defense readiness condition (DEF CON). In the movie, Las Vegas was selected as a nuclear target, and since the event was being hosted in Las Vegas, it occurred to Jeff Moss to name the convention DEF CON. However, to a lesser extent, CON also stands for convention and DEF is taken from the letters on the number 3 on a telephone keypad, a reference to phreakers. The official name of the conference includes a space in-between DEF and CON.

Though intended to be a one-time event, Moss received overwhelmingly positive feedback from attendees, and decided to host the event for a second year at their urging. The event&#x27;s attendance nearly doubled the second year, and has enjoyed continued success. In 2019, an estimated 30,000 people attended DEF CON 27.

 For DEF CON&#x27;s 20th Anniversary, a film was commissioned entitled &quot;DEF CON: The Documentary&quot;. The film follows the four days of the conference, events and people (attendees and staff), and covers history and philosophy behind DEF CON&#x27;s success and unique experiences.

 In January 2018, the DEF CON China Beta event was announced. The conference was held May 11–13, 2018 in Beijing, and marked DEF CON&#x27;s first conference outside the United States. The second annual DEF CON China was canceled due to concerns related to COVID-19.

 In 2020, due to safety concerns over COVID-19 the DEF CON 28 in-person Las Vegas event was cancelled and replaced with DEF CON Safe Mode, a virtual event planned for the same August 6–9 dates as DC 28.

In 2021, DEF CON 29 was held on August 5–8 in-person in Las Vegas and virtually (via Twitch and Discord). In-person attendees were required to wear masks in conference areas and to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination. Attendees with verified vaccine records (verified by a 3rd party) were given a wristband which was required for entry into the conference areas.

== Components ==

===Handles===
Attendees at DEF CON and other Hacker conferences often utilize an alias or &quot;handle&quot; at conferences. This is in keeping with the hacker community&#x27;s desire for anonymity. Some known handles include DEF CON founder Jeff Moss&#x27; handle of &quot;Dark Tangent&quot;. A notable event at DEF CON is DEF CON 101 which starts off the conference and may offer the opportunity for an individual to come up on stage and be assigned a handle by a number of members of the community.

===Badges===
A notable part of DEF CON is the conference badge, which identifies attendees and ensures attendees can access conference events and activities. The DEF CON badge has historically been notable because of its changing nature, sometimes being an electronic badge (PCB), with LEDs, or sometimes being a non-electronic badge such as a vinyl record. Conference badges often contain challenges or callbacks to hacker or other technology history, such as the usage of the Konami Code in the DEF CON 24 badge, or the DEF CON 25 badge reverting to the look of the DEF CON 1 badge. DEF CON Badges do not (generally) identify attendees by name; however, the badges are used to differentiate attendees from others. One way of doing this has been to have different badges, a general conference attendee (HUMAN) badge, a Staff member (GOON), Vendor, Speaker, Press, and other badges. In addition, individuals and organizations have begun creating their own badges in what has become known as badgelife. These badges may be purchased in many cases, or earned at the conference by completing challenges or events. Some badges may give the holder access to after hours events at the conference. In 2018, the evolution of this came with what was termed &quot;shitty addon&#x27;s&quot; or SAOs. These were miniature (usually) PCBs that connected to the official and other badges that may extend functionality or were just collected.

===Villages===
Villages are dedicated spaces arranged around a specific topic. Villages may be considered mini conferences within the con, with many holding their own independent talks as well as hands-on activities such as CTFs, or labs. Some villages include Aerospace Village, Car Hacking Village, IoT Village, Recon, Biohacking, lockpicking, ham radio, and the well known Social Engineering and vote hacking villages. In 2018 the vote hacking village gained media attention due to concerns about US election systems security vulnerabilities.

===Internal Conferences===
DEF CON has its own cultural underground which results in individuals wanting to create their own meetups or &quot;cons&quot; within DEF CON. These may be actual formal meetups or may be informal. Well known cons are:
* Queercon, a meetup of LGBTQ community.
* Linecon, any long line has the potential to turn into a con.
* QuietCon, a meetup to hang out or talk quietly away from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the conference attendees.

===Workshops===
Workshops are dedicated classes on various topics related to information security and related topics. Historical workshops have been held on topics such as Digital Forensics investigation, hacking IoT devices, playing with RFID, fuzzing and attacking smart devices.

=== Fundraising ===
Since DEF CON 11, fundraisers have been conducted for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). The first fundraiser was a dunk tank and was an &quot;official&quot; event. The EFF now has an event named &quot;The Summit&quot; hosted by the Vegas 2.0 crew that is an open event and fundraiser. DEF CON 18 (2010) hosted a new fundraiser called MohawkCon.

== Contests ==
Within DEF CON there are many contests and events which range from, Capture the Flag, Hacker Jeopardy, Scavenger Hunt, Capture the Packet, Crash and Compile, and Hackfortress to name a few.

===Black Badge===
The Black Badge is the highest award DEF CON gives to contest winners of certain events. Capture the flag (CTF) winners sometimes earn these, as well as Hacker Jeopardy winners. The contests that are awarded Black Badges vary from year to year, and a Black Badge allows free entrance to DEF CON for life, potentially a value of thousands of dollars.

In April 2017, a DEF CON Black Badge was featured in an exhibit in the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of American History entitled &quot;Innovations in Defense: Artificial Intelligence and the Challenge of Cybersecurity&quot;. The badge belongs to ForAllSecure&#x27;s Mayhem Cyber Reasoning System, the winner of the DARPA 2016 Cyber Grand Challenge at DEF CON 24 and the first non-human entity ever to earn a Black Badge.

=== Capture the flag ===
The first instance of the DEF CON CTF was held in 1996, at the 4th DEF CON, and has been held since then every year. It&#x27;s one of the few CTF in the attack/defense format. The prize of the winning team is a couple of black badges.
==== Capture the Flag History ====
In 1996, the first DEF CON CTF was organized, with a couple of servers for participants to hack, and judges to decide if a machine has been hacked, and award points accordingly.

In 2002, the company Immunix took part in the game under the moniker &quot;immunex&quot;, to benchmark the security of their Linux-based operating system, with modifications including StackGuard, FormatGuard, OpenWall&#x27;s non-executable stack, SubDomain (the ancestor of AppArmor), ... Confident in their defense capabilities, they even opened access to their servers to other teams, and even spent some time taunting them. The team got the second place, and all their services deployed on their Immunix stack were never compromised. It was also the first year the contest had an organiser-provided services infrastructure connected to a real-time scoreboard.

In 2003, the game had become so popular that a qualification round was introduced, with the previous winner automatically qualified.

In 2008, the Sk3wl of Root team took advantage of a bug in the game (privilege dropping and forking were inverted), allowing them to have such a massive lead that they spent most of the CTF playing Guitar Hero.

In 2009, it was announced that &quot;Diutinus Defense Technology Corp&quot; (DDTEK) would be the new organisers, but nobody knew who they were. It was revealed at the end of the game that the team playing as sk3wl0fr00t was the organizer. &quot;Hacking the top hacker contest seemed like a fun way to introduce ourselves to CTF organization. The yells of &quot;bullshit&quot; from CTF teams during the DEF CON 17 awards ceremony were very gratifying.&quot; said vulc@n, a member of DDTEK, on the topic.

In 2011, the team &quot;lollerskaters dropping from roflcopters&quot; used a 0day in FreeBSD (namely CVE-2011-4062) to escape jails, causing havoc in the game&#x27;s infrastructure.

In 2016, the 15th edition of the CTF was done in partnership with the DARPA, as part of its Cyber Grand Challenge program, where teams wrote autonomous systems to play the game without any human interaction.

In 2017, the Legitimate Business Syndicate came up with their very own CPU architecture called cLEMENCy: a middle-endian with 9 bits bytes CPU. With its specifications released only 24 hours before the beginning of the CTF, it was designed with the explicit goals of both surprising the teams, and leveling the playing field by breaking all their tools.

==Groups==
DEF CON Groups are worldwide, local chapters of hackers, thinkers, makers and others. DEF CON Groups were started as a splinter off of the 2600 meetup groups because of concerns over politicization. Local DEF CON groups are formed and are posted online. DEF CON Groups are usually identified by the area code of the area where they are located in the US, and by other numbers when outside of the US e.g., DC801, DC201. DEF CON Groups may seek permission to make a logo that includes the official DEF CON logo with approval.

==Notable incidents==
Following are a list of high-profile issues which have garnered significant media attention.
== Entertainment references ==
* DEF CON was also portrayed in &quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Three of a Kind&quot; featuring an appearance by The Lone Gunmen. DEF CON was portrayed as a United States government–sponsored convention instead of a civilian convention.
* A semi-fictionalized account of DEF CON 2, &quot;Cyber Christ Meets Lady Luck&quot;, written by Winn Schwartau, demonstrates some of the early DEF CON culture.
*A trip to DEF CON for a hacker showdown figures into the plot of &quot;The Signal&quot;. Director William Eubank came to Las Vegas and screened the film at DEF CON Movie Night.
* A fictionalized version of DEF CON called &quot;EXOCON&quot; is the setting for the climax of &quot;Jason Bourne&quot;, the fifth film of the &quot;Bourne&quot; film series. The primary antagonist of the film, a fictionalized CIA director, played by Tommy Lee Jones, is a keynote speaker at the event, mimicking DEF CON 20&#x27;s controversial keynote speaker, NSA director Keith B. Alexander.
* In the &quot;Mr. Robot&quot; Season 3 opener &quot;eps3.0_power-saver-mode.h&quot; Elliot and Darlene visit a qualifying tournament for the DEF CON Capture the Flag (CTF) contest. Sharp-eyed viewers will notice DEF CON&#x27;s smiley-face-and-crossbones mascot Jack among the set decorations.
* Documentarian Werner Herzog included DEF CON in his 2016 film &quot;Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World&quot;, a film described as a &quot;playful yet chilling examination of our rapidly interconnecting online lives&quot;.

<doc id="145581" wikidata="Q413766" url="?curid=145581" title="Fibronectin">
<text>Fibronectin is a high-molecular weight (~500-~600 kDa) glycoprotein of the extracellular matrix that binds to membrane-spanning receptor proteins called integrins. Fibronectin also binds to other extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen, fibrin, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (e.g. syndecans).

Fibronectin exists as a protein dimer, consisting of two nearly identical monomers linked by a pair of disulfide bonds. The fibronectin protein is produced from a single gene, but alternative splicing of its pre-mRNA leads to the creation of several isoforms.

Two types of fibronectin are present in vertebrates:
* soluble plasma fibronectin (formerly called &quot;cold-insoluble globulin&quot;, or CIg) is a major protein component of blood plasma (300 μg/ml) and is produced in the liver by hepatocytes.
* insoluble cellular fibronectin is a major component of the extracellular matrix. It is secreted by various cells, primarily fibroblasts, as a soluble protein dimer and is then assembled into an insoluble matrix in a complex cell-mediated process.

Fibronectin plays a major role in cell adhesion, growth, migration, and differentiation, and it is important for processes such as wound healing and embryonic development. Altered fibronectin expression, degradation, and organization has been associated with a number of pathologies, including cancer, arthritis, and fibrosis.

== Structure ==
Fibronectin exists as a protein dimer, consisting of two nearly identical polypeptide chains linked by a pair of C-terminal disulfide bonds. Each fibronectin subunit has a molecular weight of ~230–~275 kDa and contains three types of modules: type I, II, and III. All three modules are composed of two anti-parallel β-sheets resulting in a Beta-sandwich; however, type I and type II are stabilized by intra-chain disulfide bonds, while type III modules do not contain any disulfide bonds. The absence of disulfide bonds in type III modules allows them to partially unfold under applied force.

Three regions of variable splicing occur along the length of the fibronectin protomer. One or both of the &quot;extra&quot; type III modules (EIIIA and EIIIB) may be present in cellular fibronectin, but they are never present in plasma fibronectin. A &quot;variable&quot; V-region exists between III14–15 (the 14th and 15th type III module). The V-region structure is different from the type I, II, and III modules, and its presence and length may vary. The V-region contains the binding site for α4β1 integrins. It is present in most cellular fibronectin, but only one of the two subunits in a plasma fibronectin dimer contains a V-region sequence.

The modules are arranged into several functional and protein-binding domains along the length of a fibronectin monomer. There are four fibronectin-binding domains, allowing fibronectin to associate with other fibronectin molecules. One of these fibronectin-binding domains, I1–5, is referred to as the &quot;assembly domain&quot;, and it is required for the initiation of fibronectin matrix assembly. Modules III9–10 correspond to the &quot;cell-binding domain&quot; of fibronectin. The RGD sequence (Arg–Gly–Asp) is located in III10 and is the site of cell attachment via α5β1 and αVβ3 integrins on the cell surface. The &quot;synergy site&quot; is in III9 and has a role in modulating fibronectin&#x27;s association with α5β1 integrins. Fibronectin also contains domains for fibrin-binding (I1–5, I10–12), collagen-binding (I6–9), fibulin-1-binding (III13–14), heparin-binding and syndecan-binding (III12–14).

== Function ==
Fibronectin has numerous functions that ensure the normal functioning of vertebrate organisms. It is involved in cell adhesion, growth, migration, and differentiation. Cellular fibronectin is assembled into the extracellular matrix, an insoluble network that separates and supports the organs and tissues of an organism.

Fibronectin plays a crucial role in wound healing. Along with fibrin, plasma fibronectin is deposited at the site of injury, forming a blood clot that stops bleeding and protects the underlying tissue. As repair of the injured tissue continues, fibroblasts and macrophages begin to remodel the area, degrading the proteins that form the provisional blood clot matrix and replacing them with a matrix that more resembles the normal, surrounding tissue. Fibroblasts secrete proteases, including matrix metalloproteinases, that digest the plasma fibronectin, and then the fibroblasts secrete cellular fibronectin and assemble it into an insoluble matrix. Fragmentation of fibronectin by proteases has been suggested to promote wound contraction, a critical step in wound healing. Fragmenting fibronectin further exposes its V-region, which contains the site for α4β1 integrin binding. These fragments of fibronectin are believed to enhance the binding of α4β1 integrin-expressing cells, allowing them to adhere to and forcefully contract the surrounding matrix.

Fibronectin is necessary for embryogenesis, and inactivating the gene for fibronectin results in early embryonic lethality. Fibronectin is important for guiding cell attachment and migration during embryonic development. In mammalian development, the absence of fibronectin leads to defects in mesodermal, neural tube, and vascular development. Similarly, the absence of a normal fibronectin matrix in developing amphibians causes defects in mesodermal patterning and inhibits gastrulation.

Fibronectin is also found in normal human saliva, which helps prevent colonization of the oral cavity and pharynx by pathogenic bacteria.

== Matrix assembly ==
Cellular fibronectin is assembled into an insoluble fibrillar matrix in a complex cell-mediated process. Fibronectin matrix assembly begins when soluble, compact fibronectin dimers are secreted from cells, often fibroblasts. These soluble dimers bind to α5β1 integrin receptors on the cell surface and aid in clustering the integrins. The local concentration of integrin-bound fibronectin increases, allowing bound fibronectin molecules to more readily interact with one another. Short fibronectin fibrils then begin to form between adjacent cells. As matrix assembly proceeds, the soluble fibrils are converted into larger insoluble fibrils that comprise the extracellular matrix.

Fibronectin&#x27;s shift from soluble to insoluble fibrils proceeds when cryptic fibronectin-binding sites are exposed along the length of a bound fibronectin molecule. Cells are believed to stretch fibronectin by pulling on their fibronectin-bound integrin receptors. This force partially unfolds the fibronectin ligand, unmasking cryptic fibronectin-binding sites and allowing nearby fibronectin molecules to associate. This fibronectin-fibronectin interaction enables the soluble, cell-associated fibrils to branch and stabilize into an insoluble fibronectin matrix.

A transmembrane protein, CD93, has been shown to be essential for fibronectin matrix assembly (fibrillogenesis) in human dermal blood endothelial cells. As a consequence, knockdown of CD93 in these cells resulted in the disruption of the fibronectin fibrillogenesis. Moreover, the CD93 knockout mice retinas displayed disrupted fibronectin matrix at the retinal sprouting front.

==Role in cancer==
Several morphological changes has been observed in tumors and tumor-derived cell lines that have been attributed to decreased fibronectin expression, increased fibronectin degradation, and/or decreased expression of fibronectin-binding receptors, such as α5β1 integrins.

Fibronectin has been implicated in carcinoma development. In lung carcinoma, fibronectin expression is increased especially in non-small cell lung carcinoma. The adhesion of lung carcinoma cells to fibronectin enhances tumorigenicity and confers resistance to apoptosis-inducing chemotherapeutic agents. Fibronectin has been shown to stimulate the gonadal steroids that interact with vertebrate androgen receptors, which are capable of controlling the expression of cyclin D and related genes involved in cell cycle control. These observations suggest that fibronectin may promote lung tumor growth/survival and resistance to therapy, and it could represent a novel target for the development of new anticancer drugs.

Fibronectin 1 acts as a potential biomarker for radioresistance and for pan-cancer prognosis.

FN1-FGFR1 fusion is frequent in phosphaturic mesenchymal tumours.

== Role in wound healing ==
Fibronectin has profound effects on wound healing, including the formation of proper substratum for migration and growth of cells during the development and organization of granulation tissue, as well as remodeling and resynthesis of the connective tissue matrix. The biological significance of fibronectin &quot;in vivo&quot; was studied during the mechanism of wound healing. Plasma fibronectin levels are decreased in acute inflammation or following surgical trauma and in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Fibronectin is located in the extracellular matrix of embryonic and adult tissues (not in the basement membranes of the adult tissues), but may be more widely distributed in inflammatory lesions. During blood clotting, the fibronectin remains associated with the clot, covalently cross-linked to fibrin with the help of Factor XIII (fibrin-stabilizing factor). Fibroblasts play a major role in wound healing by adhering to fibrin. Fibroblast adhesion to fibrin requires fibronectin, and was strongest when the fibronectin was cross-linked to the fibrin. Patients with Factor XIII deficiencies display impairment in wound healing as fibroblasts don&#x27;t grow well in fibrin lacking Factor XIII. Fibronectin promotes particle phagocytosis by both macrophages and fibroblasts. Collagen deposition at the wound site by fibroblasts takes place with the help of fibronectin. Fibronectin was also observed to be closely associated with the newly deposited collagen fibrils. Based on the size and histological staining characteristics of the fibrils, it is likely that at least in part they are composed of type III collagen (reticulin). An &quot;in vitro&quot; study with native collagen demonstrated that fibronectin binds to type III collagen rather than other types.

== &quot;In vivo&quot; vs &quot;in vitro&quot; ==
Plasma fibronectin, which is synthesized by hepatocytes, and fibronectin synthesized by cultured fibroblasts are similar but not identical; immunological, structural, and functional differences have been reported. It is likely that these differences result from differential processing of a single nascent mRNA. Nevertheless, plasma fibronectin can be insolubilized into the tissue extracellular matrix &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot;. Both plasma and cellular fibronectins in the matrix form high molecular weight, disulfide-bonded multimers. The mechanism of formation of these multimers is not presently known. Plasma fibronectin has been shown to contain two free sulfhydryls per subunit (X), and cellular fibronectin has been shown to contain at least one. These sulfhydryls probably are buried within the tertiary structure, because sulfhydryls are exposed when the fibronectin is denatured. Such denaturation results in the oxidation of free sulfhydryls and formation of disulfide-bonded fibronectin multimers. This has led to speculation that the free sulfhydryls may be involved in formation of disulfide-bonded fibronectin multimers in the extracellular matrix. Consistent with this, sulfhydryl modification of fibronectin with N-ethylmaleimide prevents binding to cell layers. Tryptic cleavage patterns of multimeric fibronectin do not reveal the disulfide-bonded fragments that would be expected if multimerization involved one or both of the free sulfhydryls. The free sulfhydryls of fibronectin are not required for the binding of fibronectin to the cell layer or for its subsequent incorporation into the extracellular matrix. Disulfide-bonded multimerization of fibronectin in the cell layer occurs by disulfide bond exchange in the disulfide-rich amino-terminal one-third of the molecule.

== Fibronectin genetic variation as a protective factor against Alzheimer&#x27;s disease ==
A specific genetic variation in Fibronectin gene was shown to reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in a multicenter, multiethnic genetic epidemiology and functional genomics study. This effect is believed to be through enhancing the brain&#x27;s ability to clear the toxic waste and protein accumulation through the blood–brain barrier.

== Interactions ==
Besides integrin, fibronectin binds to many other host and non-host molecules. For example, it has been shown to interact with proteins such fibrin, tenascin, TNF-α, BMP-1, rotavirus NSP-4, and many fibronectin-binding proteins from bacteria (like FBP-A; FBP-B on the N-terminal domain), as well as the glycosaminoglycan, heparan sulfate.

Fibronectin has been shown to interact with:
* CD44
* COL7A1,
* LPA,
* IGFBP3,
* TNC, and
* TRIB3.

<text>Iolanda Cristina Gigliotti (; 17 January 1933 – 3 May 1987), professionally known as Dalida (, ; ), was an Italian naturalized French singer and actress. Leading an international career, Dalida has sold over 140 million records worldwide. Her best known songs include &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;Darla dirladada&quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;Bang Bang&quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot; and &quot; featuring spoken word by Alain Delon.

Initially an actress, she made her debut in the film &quot;A Glass and a Cigarette&quot; by Niazi Mustapha in 1955. A year later, having signed with the Barclay record company, Dalida achieved her first success as a singer with &quot;Bambino&quot;. Following this, she became the top-selling recording artist in France between 1957 and 1961. Her music charted in many countries in Europe and Latin America. She collaborated with singers such as Julio Iglesias, Charles Aznavour, Johnny Mathis and Petula Clark.

Although she made a few films during her career as a singer, she effectively reconnected with cinema with &quot;The Sixth Day&quot;, a film by Youssef Chahine released in 1986. In France, although the film was hailed by critics, it was a commercial failure.

Dalida was deeply disturbed by the suicide of her partner Luigi Tenco in 1967. Despite this, she forged ahead with her career, forming the record label International Show with her brother Orlando, recording more music and performing at concerts and music competitions. After struggling with bouts of depression for many years, Dalida committed suicide by drug overdose on 3 May 1987.

== Early years ==
=== Childhood in Cairo ===

Dalida was born Iolanda Cristina Gigliotti in Cairo, Kingdom of Egypt, on 17 January 1933. Her father Pietro Gigliotti (1904–1945) and mother Filomena Giuseppina (; 1904–1971) were born in Serrastretta, Calabria, Italy. Pietro studied music at school and played the violin in taverns; Giuseppina was a seamstress. By birth, Dalida automatically gained Italian nationality through &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; of both Italian parents.

Unable to make a living in their hometown, the young couple moved to the Shubra district of Cairo the year they were married, where, between the births of Iolanda&#x27;s older brother Orlando (1930–1992) and younger brother Bruno (1936), the Gigliotti family became well established in the community. In addition to earnings from Giuseppina&#x27;s work, their social status benefited when Pietro became primo violino at Cairo&#x27;s Khedivial Opera House, and the family bought a two-storey house.

At 10 months old, Gigliotti caught an eye infection and had to wear bandages for 40 days. Her father would play lullabies on the violin to soothe her. She underwent eye operations between the ages of three and five. Having to wear glasses throughout elementary school, for which she was bullied, she later recalled: &quot;I was enough of it, I would rather see the world in a blur than wear glasses, so I threw them through the window.&quot; Gigliotti attended the Scuola Tecnica Commerciale Maria Ausiliatrice, an Italian Catholic school located in northern Shubra.

In 1940, Allied forces took her father and other Italian men from their quarter to the Fayed prison camp in the desert near Cairo. When Pietro was released in 1944, he returned home a completely different person, so violent that Gigliotti and other children in the neighbourhood were scared of him. She later recalled, &quot;I hated him when he beat me, I hated him especially when he beat my mom and brothers. I wanted him to die, and he did.&quot; Gigliotti was twelve when Pietro died of a brain abscess in 1945.

=== Modelling, acting ===

In her teen years, Gigliotti developed an interest in acting due to her uncle&#x27;s job as a projectionist for a local cinema, and often participated in school performances at the end of the semester. She graduated in 1951, and began working as a copy typist in a pharmaceutical company the same year. While required to work to financially help her family, Gigliotti still had acting ambitions.

Shortly thereafter, her best friend Miranda encouraged her to compete in Miss Ondine, a minor Cairo beauty pageant which she entered on the assurance that it was just for fun and that her mother would not find out. When Gigliotti unexpectedly won second prize and Miranda won second runner-up, they were photographed and the photographs were published in newspapers and . The next day, when her mother found out, she forcibly cut Gigliotti&#x27;s hair short. Eventually, her mother relented and Gigliotti left her job to start modelling for Donna, a Cairo-based fashion house.

Three Egyptian film directors cast Gigliotti in their productions: Marco de Gastyne cast her in &quot;The Mask of Tutankhamun&quot; (1954) and Niazi Mostafa cast her in a supporting role in &quot;A Glass and a Cigarette&quot; (1954), on posters for which she appears with her newly adopted stage name Dalila because, as she explained in 1968, &quot;it was a very frequent name in Egypt and I liked it a lot.&quot;

=== Relocation to Paris and decisive 421 dice game ===

On 25 December 1954, Dalila left Egypt for Paris. Her first residence was a room in an apartment belonging to Gastyne&#x27;s friend, the impresario Vidal. She met with a number of directors and auditioned for movie roles, but failed each time. Vidal relocated her to a smaller apartment, where her first neighbour was the actor Alain Delon (who at this time was still unknown to the wider public), with whom she had a brief relationship.

Dalila&#x27;s difficulty in finding acting work throughout 1955 led her to try singing. Vidal introduced her to Roland Berger, a friend and professor who agreed to give her singing lessons seven days per week for a low fee. He was strict and used to yell, with Dalila responding even more loudly. Their lessons sometimes ended with her slamming the door, but she always returned the next day. Seeing her progress, Berger arranged for her to perform in the cabaret on Champs-Élysées, where she was spotted by Jacques Paoli, the director of another cabaret, . Paoli engaged her for a series of performances that proved to be popular, and Dalila received her first attention from the public in France, among whom was Bruno Coquatrix, the director of Olympia, who invited her to perform in his singing contest . Coquatrix later said: &quot;[H]er voice is full of colour and volume, and has all that men love: gentleness, sensuality and eroticism.&quot; Dalila was also spotted by author and screenwriter Alfred Marchand, who advised to change her name to Dalida, since her pseudonym too closely resembled the Biblical character as depicted in the movie &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;. She immediately followed the advice.

On 9 April 1956, Dalida participated in the singing contest , performing &quot;&quot;. Prior to the competition, Eddie Barclay, the owner of the largest record label in France, Barclay, and , the artistic director of the newly established radio station Europe n°1, met in Bar Romain (now ) and discussed what to do that evening. Barclay wanted to watch a film, whereas Morisse wanted to attend the singing competition, which was being held at Olympia Hall, then the largest venue in Paris. They settled their disagreement by playing 421, a dice game, which Morisse won. Together with their friend Coquatrix, they were greatly impressed after Dalida won the contest, and arranged a meeting with her. This event was later revisited in biopics and books, and became regarded as fateful for Dalida&#x27;s career. The three men went on to play a large part in launching her career.

== Career ==

=== &quot;Les années Barclay&quot; – The Barclay years ===

==== First contract and overnight success with &quot;Bambino&quot; ====

After the performance in , Morisse handed Dalida his card so that they could meet in his office as soon as possible, which she accepted without hesitation. A few days later, on the second floor of the building at 26 , she performed &quot;&quot;, a recent hit by Amália Rodrigues, humming the a cappella verses and tapping her fingertips on a corner of Morisse&#x27;s desk. Visibly satisfied, he demanded that she work on minor imperfections before a new audition in front of Eddie Barclay in person. On 2 May 1956 in Barclay&#x27;s office at 20 , Dalida signed a renewable one-year contract, with a modest percentage on record sales, with the promise of increasing it if the expected success was accomplished. While Morisse was responsible for radio promotion, Coquatrix had developed a strategy to grab the headlines. He planned to promote her through a series of concerts, including two concerts at the Olympia, two weeks in Bobino, and a tour of the provinces.

Her first song &quot;Madona&quot; was recorded in June and was first released in August on an EP with three other songs. &quot;Madona&quot; was played on 28 August 1956 on Radio Europe n°1, which was Dalida&#x27;s first radio appearance. The record achieved sufficient success and was followed by a second EP, Le Torrent, a month later, which received an equally encouraging welcome. Dalida continued performing live throughout the latter part of 1956, while her promoters worked on developing a song that would make her a star; Morisse asked lyricist Jacques Larue to write a French language version of &quot;, the winning song at the recent inaugural , which would become &quot;.

&quot;&quot; was released in early December only as a promo single, but quickly received more public interest than all of her previous recordings. Morisse started to heavily promote it and it was placed as the first track on Dalida&#x27;s debut album , which was issued at the end of the same month. The album was immediately followed by a third EP titled . After debuting at number seven in January 1957, &quot;Bambino&quot; reached number one and went on to become the biggest-selling and one of the most beloved pop standard hits of the 1950s in France, Belgium, Canada and Switzerland. As the song knocked Doris Day&#x27;s &quot;Whatever Will Be, Will Be&quot; off the top of the French charts, women began to emulate Dalida&#x27;s makeup, resulting in an explosion of Rimmel sales, while men saw in her a talent, sensuality and sexiness. Coquatrix then named her &quot;the first sex-symbol of the song&quot;. &quot;Bambino&quot; was Dalida&#x27;s first number-one hit, and through 1957 it became the longest-running number one in world history, with a total of 39 consecutive weeks, a record that it still holds. It made Dalida an overnight star and gave her her first gold disc, the very first time that such an award had been received by a woman, on 19 September 1957 for sales of over 300,000. As the French music industry was then still in the background, &quot;&quot; was described in 2007 by Bertrand Dicale of Le Figaro as &quot;a launch that announced what will happen in the coming decades ... a start of really modern times where singer is more important than song&quot;. Promoting it in early 1957, Dalida also made her first TV appearance, and her contract was immediately extended for four years. Then she also received her first criticism from a journalist: &quot;On stage, Dalida appears in beauty and warmth, highlighted by a presentation of extreme sobriety.&quot;

==== First Olympia concert, new success with &quot;Gondolier&quot;, tourings and return to film ====

On the night of 27 February 1957, Dalida held her first concert at the Olympia, as the opening act for Charles Aznavour, and was widely applauded. Then, in April, she performed a successful two-week series of concerts at Bobino, and in the summer a fan club was established, the first such club to be devoted to a female artist. As well as live performances, the prolonged success of &quot;&quot; through 1957 was followed with new recordings such as &quot;Miguel&quot; and &quot;, which eventually replaced &quot; as number one in France in October. Dalida came back to the Olympia in September as the opening act for Gilbert Bécaud; the newly renovated Olympia having just acquired its red neon facade sign. A future iconic symbol of the hall, Bécaud and Dalida became the first two names to appear on it. After her second success there, Dalida released her second album &quot;Miguel&quot; and returned to the studio in mid-October to record what was to become one of her old standards, &quot;&quot;. Staying in the top ten for eight months, it earned Dalida a second gold disc.

Dalida&#x27;s experimentation with exotica resulted in &quot;&quot;, released for Christmas 1957. For this exotic song with accentuated vocals, Dalida delivered a TV appearance where, while sailing an imaginary gondola, the shoulder strap of her dress fell down. The reappearance of this video in the 1970s made the moment notable, and the public started to consider it iconic that Dalida dared to do such a thing on television during such a conventional time in society. Nevertheless, &quot; debuted at number one in both the French and Canadian charts, where it spent four months, remaining in the top twenty for almost a year and becoming her biggest hit since &quot;. Its B side &quot;&quot; also proved popular, reaching number one in Canada. Dalida then also started to perform more frequently in France, Belgium and Luxembourg.

By the end of April 1958, a radio programmer heard Dalida recording &quot;&quot; in Barclay&#x27;s Hoche studios in Paris. After immediately asking for a copy of the tape and broadcasting it, the radio station was swamped with phone calls from people asking for the number of the disc and when it would be available. As the song replaced &quot;Gondolier&quot; as number one in France, Dalida scored a still-current chart record in France of five songs simultaneously in the top ten. It was followed by her receipt of RMC&#x27;s singer of the year award, which she went on to win for six consecutive years. In June she embarked upon her first &quot;&quot; tour (Tour de France with Dalida), with a daily appearance in the city hosting each stage of the 1958 Tour de France, which she repeated several time in future decades. She also performed in Algiers during the summer, supporting the morale of French soldiers fighting the Algerian War, and held a new series of galas in France and Belgium that regularly ended with two hours of autograph signing. During this summer Dalida released her third album , and also recorded several new songs such as &quot;, &quot; and &quot;; all of which were sales successes, each earning Dalida a gold disc. With &quot;, Dalida started French rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and also paved the way for foreign rock artists to enter the market, such as Paul Anka.

In late 1958, Dalida returned to film in her first on-screen role in four years, playing the supporting role of a singer-spy in the mystery film . A few months later, she appeared alongside Eddie Barclay in , both starring as themselves. These two B movies were also used for promotion of her three songs &quot;, &quot;, and &quot;, and were released in September 1958 and March 1959, respectively.

On 9 October, she again performed at Bobino, this time for three weeks as the headline performer, where she promoted her latest releases &quot;, which peaked in the charts the same week, and &quot;. Topping the charts in January 1959, where it remained over most of the winter, &quot; proved to be an ultimate holiday hit in France and Belgium, as Dalida could be seen promoting it on a Christmas-themed television set. The record&#x27;s B side &quot;&quot; also achieved success, topping the Canadian charts. According to her biographer Catherine Rihoit, her live television appearances &quot;got her into the palms of society, keeping her position as a favorite singer of all age groups in the francophonie&quot;, and marked an era of late 1950s television shows. On 26 December 1958 Dalida was in New York with Morisse where they met Norman Granz, the American impresario of Ella Fitzgerald, who invited her to Hollywood and offered a fifteen-year contract to launch her career in the United States. She quickly rejected the offer, saying that she wanted to focus on her musical career in France where she was already well known with a secure fan base.

==== &quot;Am Tag als der Regen kam&quot; and international recognition; best selling singer in Europe ====

Dalida toured extensively in 1959, playing sold-out dates in France, Egypt, Italy and Germany. As her fame spread outside France, she started to record songs in other languages to cater for these new audiences. She understood five languages and interpreted her songs in eleven languages: German, Egyptian Arabic, English, Lebanese Arabic, Spanish, French, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese and Dutch. In February, during a TV appearance, she performed her recent version of &quot;. On 2 March, the Minister of informations awarded her, alongside Yves Montand, with the Bravos du music hall, the most prestigious music award in France, as the most popular singer in France. During the summer, she covered her own recordings &quot; and &quot; &quot; in Flemish as &quot;&quot; and &quot; &quot;, respectively, the only time in her career that she sang in Flemish.

In late summer, Dalida was back in the studio to record her first major international hit. In the period from 1958 to 1959, &quot; was recorded in three languages, propelling Dalida straight into the top three in six different European countries. The German-language version &quot; topped the German charts for ten weeks in September and October, earning her another gold disc. It was the best-selling record of the year in Germany, and remains one of the most successful songs in the history of the country. During the closing night of the Berlin Film Festival on 28 September 1959, she was presented with a Golden Lion award by RTL as the best-selling musical artist of the year in Germany, and was saluted with a fanfare playing the verses of &quot;&quot;. The song was her first international hit, reaching half a million accumulated copies and remaining one of her greatest successes in Germany.

During the course of 1959, Dalida scored five Top 10 hits in French charts, most notably &quot; and &quot;; both of which earned gold discs. In Italy, RAI awarded her with and Golden Wolf awards as the best-selling musical artist of the year in the country. These were her first two foreign awards and furthered her international recognition. Dalida also performed in successful sold-out concerts in Berlin, Athens and Cairo, delivering a sentimental performance in front of a crowd in the Rivoli cinema that she frequented as a child. On 23 September 1959, Dalida sang in a successful three-week run at Parisian , where a jukebox was installed in recognition of her being dubbed &quot;Mademoiselle Jukebox&quot;, the most listened-to artist on jukeboxes in France. By the end of the year, she had released her fifth and sixth albums, and &quot;Love in Portofino&quot; (titled after her hit song &quot;Love in Portofino&quot;), and had already sold three and a half million records, the highest sales of all European artists.

==== &quot;Les Enfants du Pirée&quot; and &quot;Itsi bitsi petit bikini&quot;; transition to yé-yé and first Olympia concert residency ====

Dalida began 1960 with &quot;&quot;, which became a chart-topper in France and Belgium in February. She then embarked upon her first world tour and reached the summit of the charts again with &quot; in April. Her third release of the year &quot; brought Dalida huge commercial success, becoming her second biggest international hit after &quot;&quot;. It reached the top two in six European countries and in Canada, topping the charts in three of them. After its debut at the top of the French charts in June 1960, where it remained for 20 weeks, it became the first song by a French singer to sell over one million copies internationally, and the expression (&quot;hit of the summer&quot;) was invented after its success. Dalida eventually recorded it in five different languages and made a video to be shown on TV, . With a harbor theme, it showed Dalida singing and lying on a fishing net with a wind machine blowing, and journalist Jacques Chancel called it &quot;the first video in France that really made a shift from the era of outdated videos&quot;.

The success was followed by her second Italian award and a Golden Wolf as the best-selling musical artist of the year. Back in France, Dalida was not pleased by the emergence of the new musical style yé-yé, as the new singers would only briefly occupy the charts and then disappear. Also, since the appearance of new radio programs for youth such as , both music-hall songs and singers, such as Dalida, began to be regarded as obsolete. Dalida realized that she would have to make a drastic change to retain her image, and in September she covered the US hit &quot;. Now one of her signature songs, it became the first big yé-yé hit in France and became the second song to receive the title , displacing &quot; from the top of the charts. Securing her position as a leading singer in France, &quot;&quot; introduced Dalida to a whole new generation of young fans. Topping the charts across Western Europe and in Canada, the record was also her second to sell over a million and gained her a thirteenth golden disc.

This success was followed by &quot;Milord&quot;, a number one in Austria, Germany and Italy, after which her first album issued solely for the Italian public was named. Dalida then completed a year-long world tour, performing in countries across Europe, in Canada and in several Arab states. In December, she issued an EP collecting four of the best-known holiday carols in French, and her New Year&#x27;s show broke the record for a TV audience, with nearly six million viewers.

In January 1961, Dalida covered The Drifters&#x27; &quot;Save the last dance for me&quot; as &quot;&quot;, reaching the top two. It remained her biggest French hit of the year as she undertook another year-long world tour, which started in Tehran on 18 February in front of the Iranian royal family in their Sa&#x27;dabad Palace. With a total of almost 200 dates, the last leg of the tour included Dalida&#x27;s first own concert residency at the Olympia, which started on 6 December. Due to her recent love affair, her divorce from Morisse and her new yé-yé direction, several critics announced this to be &quot;attestment of an end and downfall of Dalida&quot;. Dalida &quot;brought the house down&quot; according to Beuve-Méry of ; the month-long show was a sell-out success, with the first night being broadcast live by Radio Europe N°1. Among other musicians who attended, she was congratulated by Édith Piaf, who told her: &quot;You are a winner, like me. After me, it will be you.&quot; Dalida also set the record for the largest public attendance and the longest-running concert residency at the Olympia, with a total of 52,000 spectators over the course of 30 days, a record that she would break herself in 1981. At the very end of the year, on 30 December, Dalida completed her world tour at the Ancienne Belgique in Bruxelles, Olympia&#x27;s Belgian equivalent.

During 1961, Dalida issued a set of new Italian songs on the EP, and also scored several top ten hits internationally such as &quot; and &quot;. In April &quot;Pépé&quot; became a number one hit both in Austria and Germany, while &quot;24 mille baisers&quot; charted separately in Austria and France. She also issued two albums and . During the spring in Italy, Dalida signed with film director Giorgio Simonelli and revived her film career with the first film in which she plays the main role. Originally titled , it was revoiced and retitled for a French audience as , after one of the soundtrack songs. The movie also features several other recordings by Dalida, including the posthumously released &quot;&quot;. In contrast to her other previous movies, was not a commercial failure, with the moderate gross income eventually surpassing the low budget. Rihoit wrote: &quot;sealing her appearance of the early 60&#x27;s, since it is also her first color film, all the power and acting potential that Dalida carries in herself and transmits to the screen is clearly visible&quot;.

==== &quot;La Leçon de Twist&quot;, &quot;Le Petit Gonzales&quot;, exhaustive tours and scopitones ====
After a short break Dalida was back on tour, this time starting in Canada where &quot; had reached number one. On 5 February, on the popular French youth TV program , Dalida performed her latest yé-yé release &quot;&quot;. Accompanied on the piano by then leading French teen idol Johnny Hallyday, he also taught Dalida the dance moves, about what she said: &quot;he really showed himself, the most friendly of teachers of this new rhythm&quot;. The performance caused a sensation, rocketing her track straight to the top of French and Belgian charts. &quot; was followed by another success in the same genre &quot;, with the lyrics &quot;Oh dad, buy me a jukebox, to listen to Elvis Presley, Les Chaussettes Noires, and Johnny Hallyday – And Dalida? But what is she doing here, they still listen to her?&quot;, Dalida was making a joke at her own expense referring to the current situation in France where the young people were fond of young singers, despite her success during the yé-yé era. The record spent two weeks at number one during the spring.

From April to July Dalida toured Italy and Vietnam. In Saigon, her popularity led to traffic congestion when she performed, but the local authorities interrupted her show during a rendition of &quot;&quot; because the song was considered to be a political act. In May Dalida was back at the top of the international charts with &quot;&quot;, a cover of &quot;Speedy Gonzales&quot;, which peaked in France, Belgium, Canada and Spain the following month and remains known as &quot;one of the most memorable and nostalgic recordings of the yé-yé era&quot;, according to in 1987. The album of the same name was issued later in the year.

Although Dalida had filmed her first scopitone in 1961 for the song &quot;, starting a series of music videos that were followed by almost all yé-yé newcomers, her best critically and commercially received scopitone was recorded in September 1962 for the song &quot;, in which she paid tribute to the Allies&#x27; disembarkation in Normandy on 6 June 1944. Under the direction of the young Claude Lelouch, who later became one of the most acclaimed French directors, Dalida dressed as a soldier and walked through a war-torn forest in the middle of bombing accompanied by real scenes from the Second World War. This unusual image of Dalida found an audience and was a hit in cafes. Alongside Dalida&#x27;s performance of the song on 26 September, in front of a crowd of 2,000 people on the first floor of the Eiffel Tower, &quot;&quot; topped charts in France for two weeks and earned her another gold disc.

==== More concentration on concerts, shift to pop; &quot;Eux&quot;, &quot;Amore scusami&quot; and first platinum disc ====

Dalida spent 1963 making live appearance all over the world and dedicating herself more to the young Canadian public, as yé-yé was experiencing its greatest success in France during this period. Her world tour was a success, with sold-out concerts in Europe from Portugal to Poland, Canada, Asia, Fort-de-France, Latin America and Arabian countries. In Algeria, she became the first artist to appear since the proclamation of independence. Dalida also dedicated the late summer period to filming, spending three months in Hong Kong filming in the B movie in which she starred alongside Serge Gainsbourg. Although the movie was a commercial flop, Dalida received favorable reviews.

In January 1963 at Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, Dalida was awarded with the Oscar Mondiale del Successo dei Juke Box award for the most listened artist on jukeboxes in Europe. Later the same month, she made a shift from yé-yé in covering Ben E. King&#x27;s &quot;Stand by Me&quot; as &quot;, which was followed by an equally melancholic string of recordings such as &quot;, a summer number one hit in Canada, and &quot; which subsequently peaked at number two in Argentina and was recorded in five languages. &quot; was awarded the Oscar mundial du success du disque for the most international sales by a French artist in 1963, and Dalida named her fourteenth studio album after it.

The 1963 world tour was extended into 1964 with only a few short breaks. The French leg of the tour started on 11 April 1964, during which Dalida traveled 30,000 kilometers solely by car over its five-month run, and had a public attendance in excess of 200,000. &quot;The most iconic moment of the tour&quot;, according to her brother Orlando, was a concert at Draguignan on 14 August when &quot;Dalida appeared with blond hair for the first time, and shocked the crowd that that didn&#x27;t recognize her at first glance&quot;. After the concert in Pont-sur-Yonne on 2 September, Dalida accepted the offer of local truck drivers to become their godmother of honor. The tour was followed by a concert residency in the Olympia two days later when Dalida and other celebrities, Charles Aznavour, Françoise Hardy, Johnny Hallyday and Sylvie Vartan, were conveyed to the entrance of the Olympia by the same drivers on open trucks, forming a parade through the streets of Paris. The event generated even more interest in the sold-out three-week residency, which had already received a huge amount of media coverage. During the television transmission of the crowd at the entrance, a teenage fan said: &quot;We can hardly wait for her [Dalida] to appear, we&#x27;ve been screaming for an hour and the atmosphere is so crazy&quot;, upon which the reporter turned to the camera, saying &quot;the whole of Paris came to see [the parade], only in front of the Olympia there are at least 2,000 people waiting in the street&quot;.

As Dalida was recording simultaneously with her concerts during the course of 1964, releases such as &quot;, &quot; and &quot; were poorly promoted on TV, eventually only entering the top twenty. &quot; had peaked at number six in Canada earlier in the year, but on finishing the tour in November, Dalida returned to the studio to record &quot;, an orchestral sentimental pop ballad, which was a completely new genre in her repertoire. The song was rush-released and swiftly became s hit at the end of the year, earning Dalida another gold disc, the first in two years following &quot;. Following the success of &quot;&quot;, an album of the same name was released on 17 September. Dalida was awarded with a platinum disc for surpassing sales of over 10 million records since her debut in 1956. Specifically created for her, this was the first time in the music industry that the term &quot;platinum disc&quot; had been used.

Refusing to perform at Sanremo Music Festival, Dalida instead released the EP &quot;Sanremo 65&quot; that included her latest Italian top ten hit &quot;. With new performances at Bobino and in the following months, Dalida was in the top ten in France and Belgium with a cover of Rita Pavone&#x27;s &quot; that gained huge interest among children. The B side &quot;&quot;, written and composed by Charles Aznavour, peaked at number six in Turkey and was applauded by , who wrote &quot;Sainte Totoche enters the calendar&quot; as it &quot;evokes the women neglected by their husbands&quot;. Back on world tour in 1965, Dalida held concerts in Fort-de-France where she was welcomed by more than 20,000 enthusiastic Martinicans. France-Antilles reported that &quot;only the President of the Republic had an ovation of this scale, during his visit in March 1964&quot;. The next day, Dalida herself rewarded Juliana Brown, the winner of the &quot;Dalida Song Contest&quot; which had brrn established in her honour. In a poll conducted by IFOP on 24 April 1965 Dalida was voted the favourite French singer of the decade, ahead of Édith Piaf.

==== &quot;La Danse de Zorba&quot; and &quot;Il silenzio&quot; ====

In June 1965, Dalida recorded &quot;&quot;, a song from the 1964 movie &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot;, which became her biggest international success since &quot;&quot; in early 1961. The song found Dalida in seven international charts, entering the top three in six and topping the chart in two countries. Surpassing a million copies, it also earned Dalida two more golden discs; in France, and in Brazil, where it was also awarded with the Cico Viola award for the best-selling record of the year. With Dalida making daily appearances on television dancing a sirtaki to the song in the summer of 1965, &quot;&quot; became one of the year&#x27;s , alongside Christophe&#x27;s &quot;Aline&quot; and Hervé Villard&#x27;s &quot;.

During the summer, Dalida performed in Morocco and Algeria, played a supporting role in the Italian comedy movie alongside Ugo Tognazzi and, making her debut, Romina Power, and released one of her first records in single format, &quot;.

In October, the song &quot; was released on her fourth EP of the year. It was also a chart-topping hit in Europe, Canada and Latin America, reaching number one in France and Italy, where it was the best-selling record of the year, beating &quot; and receiving a gold certification. Accompanying it were &quot; and &quot;, which were also well received in Belgium and Canada. The success of &quot;&quot; concluded the most successful year in Dalida&#x27;s career to date and produced the album of the same name, which collected the year&#x27;s releases.

1966 was marked by an extensive year-long world tour that started on 13 February in Paris, and ended on 31 December in Toulouse. With more than 150 dates, Dalida toured Canada, Latin America, Arab states and Europe. The year debuted with a number-one hit in Latin America, &quot;El Cordobés&quot;, which was a product of a collaboration with bullfighter Manuel Benítez, to whom Dalida dedicated the song as they had a brief affair. In the same period, Dalida also started employing family members, with her cousin Rosy as her secretary, and brother Bruno as her artistic director. By the end of year, they had produced the successful Italian album and three more EPs. &quot;&quot; did not achieve commercial success, but became one of her first power ballads, being based on experiences in her own life, and became a commercial success in the US when recorded by Cher as &quot;The Way of Love&quot;. In contrast, &quot;Bang Bang&quot; was a number one hit in Argentina and Italy, where it was also the best-selling record of the year. &quot; charted internationally and was accompanied by Dalida delivering energetic live performances with a tambourine. Dalida also returned to the wide screen, with a supporting role in the satirical French movie that included the unreleased song &quot;. During the summer in Rome, she was introduced to the new avant-garde singer-songwriter Luigi Tenco on an RAI set and they sang &quot;&quot; as a duet. Later in September, her Italian managers suggested that she participate with Tenco in the next Sanremo Music Festival. Although in previous years she has turned down the festival, this time she accepted as she was in a secret relationship with Tenco.

==== Sanremo and Olympia 67; &quot;The new Dalida is born!&quot; ====

With &quot;Mama&quot; in January 1967, Dalida had success in France and Turkey, and was back at the top of the Italian charts later the same year. &quot;&quot;, written and composed by Tenco, was released alongside as it had been chosen as their competing song for the Sanremo Music Festival. The festival premiered on 26 January and they both separately sang their own version. Under the influence of stage fright and alcohol, Tenco delivered a poor performance, while Dalida concluded the evening with an ovation, but eventually they were eliminated in the first round. The following night ended tragically when Tenco was found dead by Dalida in their hotel room. It was reported that a suicide note explained that he had taken his life owing to the elimination from the contest, as a protest against the corruption and bribery of the jury, but major suspicion of the involvement of the mafia emerged. Although the public did not know anything of their relationship, the event greatly affected Dalida and her next concert in Boulogne-Billancourt scheduled for 31 January was cancelled. The following week on 7 February, she appeared on the TV show , dedicating her rendition of &quot;&quot; to Tenco. Wearing the same dress that she had been wearing when she found his body, the performance was highly sentimental but indicated nothing of an emerging depression. On 26 February, Dalida attempted to take her life, ended up in hospital and spent five days in a coma. The truth was revealed about her involvement with Tenco, leaving her worldwide public stunned. Her career was put on hiatus for three months.

Returning to television on 8 June, on the verge of tears she made her first TV appearance after four months, interpreting &quot;&quot;, a cover of Tom Jones&#x27; &quot;Green, Green Grass of Home&quot;. With the lyrics &quot;I was afraid that everything would be foreign to me, but nothing seems changed, it&#x27;s good to open the gates of my house&quot; the song was directly dedicated to her return to life, pointing at her Montmartre house. At the same time, her Italian album became a chart success and &quot;&quot; topped several international charts, earning Dalida another gold disc. She also organized a four-month-long comeback tour from June to September, again performing daily in the cities hosting the stages of the Tour de France. The late summer period brought a re-release of &quot; from 1959, and a new recording &quot;, the French version of &quot;&quot; by Tenco. In September, Dalida issued her first compilation album &quot;De Bambino à Il silenzio&quot;, collecting her hits from 1956 to 1965, which was also one of the first greatest hits albums.

On the night of 5 October, Dalida premiered her third Olympia concert residency, which ran for a month. New songs such as &quot;, &quot; and &quot;&quot; marked a new direction in her career, orientating her repertoire towards more profound lyrics. Dressed in a long white dress that she would always wear on tours in future years, Dalida once again achieved a huge triumph at the venue. She was nicknamed Saint Dalida by the press. In , wrote: &quot;Dalida killed Mademoiselle Bambino. The new Dalida is born!&quot;.

==== &quot;Le Temps des fleurs&quot; ====

After competing for four months in , then the most popular TV show in Italy, in January 1968 Dalida won with &quot;Dan dan dan&quot; that reached number two in the country. Dalida also came back to film for her first main role in five years, in Italian romantic drama , acting as stewardess Judy alongside Alberto Lupo. The movie was a minor success, but as it was filmed in colour and several of her new songs appeared in, it provided critically acclaimed music video for her latest Italian chart topper and gold certified &quot;&quot;. After the filming, Dalida embarked upon a two-year-long world tour that extended until early 1970. With more than 300 live performances it was Dalida&#x27;s longest tour up to that moment and, as a part of it, in summer 1968 she participated in a popular Italian summer festival and won the main prize. In 1969, during the third leg that started on 9 January in Milan, for the first time in career Dalida performed in Yugoslavia and in Africa. After Gabon in December and in Tahiti in January 1970, the tour ended in Iran in February.

&quot; and &quot; were minor hits of early 1968, but in September Dalida came back to huge success in France with &quot;&quot;. It was an instant number one hit with a fair chart performance in several other countries, eventually being recorded in two more languages. The EP was reissued for five more times, a personal record for Barclay, receiving gold certificate and an album of the same name was released. With an issue in single format, &quot;&quot; also announced the end of a long EP era.

On 5 December 1968, in Paris city hall , Dalida received the Medal of the president of the Republic from hands of General de Gaulle who summarised the &quot;success, kindness and modesty of this woman&quot; saying: &quot;By giving you this medal, I wanted to honor a quality, a great lady of France.&quot; In France, she remains the only person from show-business to receive such distinction. During same event, Dalida became a Parisian citizen of honor, receiving the Medal of the city of Paris by the Council of Paris, and was also named &quot;the Godmother of Montmartre &quot;, the old name for poor children of the neighborhood where she lived.

Spending 1969 on tour and private travellings to India, Dalida released several less successful recordings like &quot;, &quot; and &quot;&quot;, all poorly promoted on TV and radio attracting some success in Turkey and France. &quot;Oh Lady Mary&quot; was released in autumn and remained her last Italian hit. Returning to German TV, Dalida danced casatchok on her new song &quot;&quot;, which was followed with release of three new albums: , and , a sales topper in Poland. Dalida was also awarded with MIDEM, award for the best selling artist of the year in Italy, and her first Radio Luxembourg singer of the year award, which she went on to win for several more times.

=== &quot;Les années Orlando&quot; – The Orlando years ===

Dalida and her brother Orlando were already planning for some time to form their own record house as a vehicle to release and to control her musical output. Dalida&#x27;s last record released under Barclay label was , an EP released on 15 April 1970. On 1 July Dalida signed a contract International Shows, recently established by Orlando, making him one of only several independent producers of French show business. Their first record &quot;Darla dirladada&quot; was also the first success of a very long series. Already played on radios for a month, the Greek folklore song was released as single on 15 July. &quot;Darla dirladada&quot; was an overnight hit, selling 75,000 copies within the first week and setting a record for largest weekly sales in France. The song became Dalida&#x27;s another , staying three weeks atop of French sales charts during summer and gaining gold certification in a month. Soon after, Dalida released her second record under her new label, &quot;&quot;, a cover of &quot;What Have They Done to My Song Ma&quot;, reflecting a drastic change of her repertoire in past years. It was a moderate sales success, but it won her second Radio Luxembourg award. That was followed with &quot;Pour qui pour quoi&quot;, her last record in EP format, and , the first album issued under International Show.

In October 1971, Dalida intended to book herself at Olympia for her big Parisian comeback after four years. Bruno Coquatrix did not believe in her change of style and refused to produce the show so Dalida rented and paid the venue by herself. On 24 November, announced by posters thirty meters long and four meters high on the Champs-Élysées, Dalida premiered a sold-out three-week-long concert residency, with Mike Brant as opening act. Dalida again triumphed, with public and critics plebiscite new repertoire nicknaming her &quot;the queen of the theater&quot; and &quot;a modern Phaedra&quot;. Seeing the success, Coquatrix offered &quot;Dali&quot; to return whenever she wants &quot;without having to pay a single cent&quot;. Premiere night was both recorded on video and as live album &quot;Olympia 71&quot;, published a year later alongside , while the video was first issued in 2012.

Through 1971 and 1972 Dalida held a series of successful worldwide concerts in Asia, Canada, Europe, Lebanon and Latin America. She continued to choose her new songs only for their poetic value, but still paid less attention to their commercial promotion, again traveling to Asia to develop a better understanding of herself. Each time Dalida would appear on TV performing &quot;, &quot; or &quot;&quot;, as Jacques Pessis said: &quot;masses of crazed fans were chanting &#x27;Dali&#x27; for the first time, their new nickname for her. She shaped her early 1970s image without even trying... just expressing natural emotions she carried in that period&quot;. Inspired by &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, Dalida also experimented with religious themes in songs &quot;Jésus bambino&quot; and &quot;Jésus Kitsch&quot;. She came back to high sales in September 1972 with &quot;&quot;, a cover of &quot;Godfather&quot;″s title song. Peaking at number two and with over one-half million copies sold, it became a gross hit in France by the end of year and received gold certificate.

==== &quot;Paroles, paroles&quot; and &quot;Je suis malade&quot; ====

In late 1972, Dalida recorded duet &quot; with her longtime friend Alain Delon whom she picked on her own. The lyrics, based on the original Italian version &quot;, tell a story of a man offering a woman &quot;caramels, candies and chocolate&quot; and repeats &quot;you are so beautiful&quot;, to what she answers with &quot;&quot; (&quot;words, words&quot;) indicating that his words are nothing but hollow. The single released on 17 January with B-side &quot;&quot;, topped charts in France, Japan, Mexico and Portugal, and had a fair performance in several other countries. Receiving a triple gold certification, it also spawned a dozen of international covers, inspiring foreign singers to record it in their native languages. Dalida and Delon never performed the song live, but Dalida performed for TV and concerts using his voice in playback. In the future decades, &quot;&quot; went on to become one of the most notable songs in France, and a signature track of Dalida. The expression &quot;paroles, paroles&quot; also entered everyday language, used &quot;to evoke those who make promises and never keep them&quot;.

In late July, Dalida released another song that went to become her signature track: &quot;&quot;. The writer of the song Serge Lama recorded and released it earlier that year, but it did not receive any attention until it was spotted by Dalida who later mentioned: &quot;when I saw it on television for the first time, I cried and I knew I have to record it&quot;. Dalida&#x27;s intention to popularise Lama rather than getting a profit from song made her issue it as a B-side to single &quot;. After the release and two performances, her version became a hit, but Lama&#x27;s original also drew public attention. Dalida&#x27;s gestures and facial expressions while performing &quot; were a natural expression of her personal connection to lyrics that deal with abandonment and despair. The renditions of the song during the future years left a huge impact on French society and shaped an image of Dalida, described by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; as &quot;ultimate drama queen&quot;. Both Lama and composer of the song Alice Dona frequently credited solely Dalida for being the one who made the song a success, and for boosting Lama&#x27;s career. Eventually, covered by several singers mostly as tribute to Dalida, &quot;&quot; also became a song frequently sung at competitions.

==== 1973–1975: Zenith – &quot;Gigi&quot; and &quot;18 ans&quot; ====

By the end of 1973, Dalida released the promotional single A-side &quot; with B-side &quot;. In that same time, she released the album &quot;Julien&quot; that gathers most of her 1973 songs. The song &quot; quickly started gaining success and it was again released in the beginning of 1974 but as B-side to single A-side &quot;. &quot;Il venait d&#x27;avoir 18 ans&quot; peaked number 3 in Québec, number 4 in Belgium, number 13 in Germany,″ and number 37 in Italy while &quot;&quot; beat the record held by Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot; from 1966 for the most sold single in Benelux and charted number 4 in France and number 1 in Switzerland, number 2 in Netherlands, number 1 in Flanders, number 3 in Québec, number 2 in Spain and number 59 in Italy. The first performance of both songs was during her concerts in Olympia 1974. The whole four weeks were sold out and a triumph for the singer and was followed again with a live album, &quot;Olympia 75&quot;.

=== 1975–1980: Disco period ===
In February 1975, French music critics awarded the singer with the (French Recording Academy Award). Touring from 1974 to 1975 would follow this period of unprecedented sales. During 1975, she released duet &quot;&quot; with her partner Richard Chanfray. This single peaked number 16 in France.

At the end of 1975, Dalida released a new album that gathered some songs from singles released in 1974 and 1975 plus some new material. Most of the songs were from the same genre except for the disco-genre song &quot;&quot;. This song, released as a single in January 1976, reached number 1 on the French charts and was both first disco hit in France and disco hit in French language. Achieving that, Dalida holds the title of &quot;the inventor of French disco&quot;. Around the same time, the popularity of variety shows increasing in France and Dalida started making television appearances on a weekly basis there and across Europe.

Following her disco success, in mid-1976 she released a new album with newly recorded songs, most of them disco. The most notable one was &quot;&quot; (number 7 in France and number 10 in Turkey). 1977 was a successful year for Dalida both in her private and professional life. She released three albums. One of them was live &quot;Olympia 77&quot;, released following her again four-week triumph at Olympia in 1977. The other two were albums with completely new songs. &quot;&quot; became the first ever Egyptian folk hit in the world. Originally sung in Egyptian Arabic, the song was translated into French, Italian, and German. Part of the lyrics are based on an old Egyptian folk song about homesickness and celebrating the Egyptian nation.

Dalida continued touring the world, including the US, for the second time since the 1950s, by playing two nights in New York City&#x27;s Carnegie Hall in November 1978. &quot;The New York Times&quot; review of the Carnegie Hall concert praised Dalida&#x27;s performance and noted its intimacy and intensity after she began to converse midway through it, revealing her personality. Most of the audience were French citizens. The concerts were almost sold out, but nevertheless, it was another triumph for her. Due to the concert, she was offered for the second time a contract to perform in the US, but she refused it again. In February, during her 1977 Canada tour, an obsessed fan tried to kidnap her by using a hammer but did not succeed.

Other hit performances of Dalida include &quot;The Lambeth Walk&quot;, sung in English and French, and aforementioned &quot;, released in 1973 achieving success in 1977. In 1979, Dalida recorded her biggest disco hit, &quot;, written by Toto Cutugno. The song was a smash hit, peaking at number 1 on the French charts. By the end of 1979, she released the semi-biographical song &quot; where she, through music, speaks about herself in a humorous way. Her debut of 1980 was marked by the release of a big disco hit, &quot;. Then she released the album &quot;Gigi in Paradisco&quot;, named for the title song, which was a sequel to her previous hit &quot;&quot;.

In 1979, Dalida met Lester Wilson. Agreeing to work together he became her choreographer for the upcoming spectacle in the Paris , booked for January 1980. In total, Dalida performed for three hours per day for fifteen days with ten costume changes and twelve dancers in front of an audience of around 90,000 people. At , the largest playing venue in Paris and one of the biggest in France, there was much the same triumph as in Olympia.

Following the spectacle, Dalida released the double live album and organized a new European tour and a small World tour. She toured in the whole Western and Eastern Europe except Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. Also, she held concerts in Brazil, the US and Canada. When she came back, she organized a tour across the whole of France delivering more than 20 sold-out concerts monthly across the French towns and cities. In 1980, problems in her private life appeared again and were reflected in the song &quot;&quot;.

==== 1981–1987: Diva trademark years ====

Dalida left disco and started singing slower, moody, deep-minded songs with typical 1980s instruments.
From March to April 1981, she gave a month of sold-out concerts at the Olympia in Paris, emulating her successful 1980 tour. Her last concert of April 1981 at the Olympia became her last concert at that venue, because the following year, the Olympia went bankrupt (it re-opened in 1989). On the night of her inaugural performance, she became the first singer to be awarded a diamond disc, in recognition of her record sales which had reached 45 million. Olympia was followed up by the release of her last named Olympia album, &quot;Olympia 81&quot;, but this time, it was not recorded live. She refused to be a model for &quot;Marianne&quot; of France. Instead of disco, Dalida started to record dance songs, which had soon replaced disco in French clubs. At the end of 1981, she starred in a New Year TV spectacle called &quot;Special Dalida&quot;. She co-hosted and sang her songs.

At the beginning of 1982, she had many TV appearances singing still unreleased songs, followed by the release of a new dance album, &quot;Special Dalida&quot;. The most remembered songs of the album are the dance songs &quot;, &quot; and the moody &quot;. Dalida was growing older, yet she launched a new world tour in 1982, spending most of the years from 1982 to 1984 playing sold-out concerts Rio de Janeiro to Europe and Asia. She made a lot of TV appearances in the 1980s almost every second week. In the summer of 1982, during the FIFA World Cup, like many other singers, Dalida released a song for the French team, &quot; (#17 in France).

In the first part of 1983, she released several songs, the most notable being &quot;&quot;. The dance-pop song has very profound lyrics and has remained a big hit, one of the signature tracks by Dalida. Most of her songs of 1983 were gathered on her album released in mid-1983, , which also featured such singles as &quot;Lucas&quot; and &quot;Bravo&quot;.

By the beginning of 1984, her personal difficulties escalated again; she could not dedicate as much time to her career as she would have wanted. However, she recorded a new collection of mainly dance songs including &quot; and &quot;. In mid-1984, she recorded the album &quot;Dali&quot;, a collection of all her songs released that year. To promote the album, a television special was later released on VHS named ; it was filmed in 1984, and directed by the then highly rated Jean-Christophe Averty. It includes Dalida singing in seven languages and dancing her way through a huge number of her earlier hits with the best video effects available at the time and wearing more than 40 outfits from the best French and international fashion designers, maintaining her &quot;Glamour&quot; and &quot;DIVA&quot; trademarks gained during the disco era in the late seventies.

She successfully engaged to keep the new radio station NRJ on air through her connections.

Dalida&#x27;s eye problems returned. She underwent two major eye operations in 1985 and put her career on hold as the stage lights started to become difficult for her to endure. She released &quot;&quot;, a cover of George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Last Christmas&quot;. In early 1985, Dalida occasionally performed live and made numerous TV appearances. When her eyes recovered in mid-1985, she accepted the role of a young grandmother in the Youssef Chahine film &quot;The Sixth Day&quot;. The latter would become a commercial failure in France despite very favorable media criticism, especially from intellectuals. Little more than 50,000 entries would be made. As she always wanted to become an actress, she temporarily disregarded her singing career and fully devoted herself to the movie. She returned to France to promote it in late 1985.

In 1986, she released with more new recordings and some singles from the album, which became her last album. &quot; and &quot; were songs that failed to hit the charts upon their release. She did promote the album but not as well as she used to do previously, due to issues in her private life which had never been worse since 1967. Dalida, therefore, began spending more and more time alone at home or going out with friends to pass the time, further neglecting her career. Dalida ceased to create new material in the recording studio, instead devoting herself to perform concerts. Once again organising a lot of concerts on a monthly basis and singing her previously known hits, Dalida was then known for the amazing &quot;show&quot; performances, wearing her wardrobe from 1980 to 1982. She sang glamorous disco-dance songs from same period such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Gigi in paradisco&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Monday, Tuesday...&quot;, &quot;.

By the beginning of 1987, Dalida was falling into a severe depression. A vacation offered no relief, and despite her struggles, she managed to mask her pain, giving the glamorous appearance of someone who still loved life. Although no new songs had been recorded, she toured internationally from Los Angeles to the Middle East. Being part of the music spotlight in 1978, many of her songs appeared daily on TV, as well as many notable TV appearances on talk shows from 1986 to 1987. Her last live TV appearance was at the César Awards night of March 7 1987. Her last live performance took place in Antalya, Turkey from 27 to 29 April 1987, just before her suicide. Her performance was not recorded by the national television of Turkey which was the only TV channel in the country.

== Personal life and death ==
Dalida&#x27;s private life was marred by a series of failed relationships, personal problems and the suicides of several people close to her.

In January 1967, she took part in the Sanremo Festival with her new lover, Italian singer, songwriter, and actor Luigi Tenco. The song he presented was &quot; (&quot;Bye Love, Bye&quot;), which he sang together with Dalida, but Tenco failed despite Dalida&#x27;s performance.
Tenco died by suicide on 27 January 1967, after learning that his song had been eliminated from the final competition. He was found by Dalida in his hotel room with a bullet wound in his left temple and a note announcing that his gesture was against the jury and public&#x27;s choices during the competition. Prior to Tenco&#x27;s suicide, Dalida and he had become engaged. One month later, Dalida attempted to take her own life by drug overdose at the hotel in Paris. She spent five days in a coma and several months convalescing. Dalida returned to the stage the following October.

In December 1967, she became pregnant by a 22-year-old Italian student, Lucio. She had an abortion that left her infertile.

In September 1970, her former husband , to whom she was married from 1956 to 1961, killed himself by shooting himself in the head.

In April 1975, her close friend, singer Mike Brant, leapt to his death from an apartment in Paris. He was 28. Dalida had contributed to his success in France when he opened concerts for her in 1971 at L&#x27;Olympia.

In July 1983, , her lover from 1972 to 1981, killed himself by inhaling the exhaust gas of his Renault 5.

=== Death ===
On the night of 2 to 3 May 1987, Dalida committed suicide at her house in Montmartre by overdosing on barbiturates. She left behind a note which read, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Life is unbearable for me. Forgive me.&quot;)

Dalida is buried at the Montmartre Cemetery, 18th Division, .

== Legacy ==

Her output has also been the subject of various remix albums. Since her death, many of Dalida&#x27;s hits have been remixed to modern techno and dance beats. Around 50 biographies have been written in her name. In 2009, Lara Fabian said that Dalida had influenced her the most.

<text>The River Chet is a small river in South Norfolk, England, a tributary of the River Yare. It rises in Poringland and flows eastwards through Alpington, Bergh Apton, Thurton and Loddon. At Loddon it passes under the A146 through Loddon Mill and into Loddon Staithe. From this point onwards the river is navigable. It then passes Hardley Flood to the north, a nature reserve part-managed by the Norfolk Wildlife Trust. The river finally joins the River Yare one mile west of Reedham at Hardley Cross, erected in 1676, which marks the ancient boundary between the City of Norwich and the Borough of Great Yarmouth. The total navigable length is some 3½ miles.

==Fishing==
Fishing is permitted between Loddon and Hardley Cross, bream and roach being the most common catch.

==Churches==
A number of churches along the river are known as the &quot;Chet Valley Churches&quot;. Most belong to the Church of England but they include the Church in Loddon, a combined Anglican and Methodist congregation.

<doc id="145590" wikidata="Q4980777" url="?curid=145590" title="River Wensum">
<text>The River Wensum is a chalk river in Norfolk, England and a tributary of the River Yare, despite being the larger of the two rivers. The river is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest and Special Area of Conservation.

The Wensum is the principal river on which the city of Norwich was founded. The river passes Carrow Road, the home of Norwich City F.C.; one end of the ground was originally named &quot;The River End&quot; in its honour, a name that still persists among fans.

==Etymology==
The river receives its name from the Old English adjective &quot;wandsum&quot; or &quot;wendsum&quot;, meaning &quot;winding&quot;.

==Course==

Modern Ordnance Survey Maps list the source of the Wensum as lying between the villages of Colkirk and Whissonsett in northwest Norfolk. The reasoning behind this claim is unknown given that other tributaries are further from the mouth; pre-modern maps and other written sources refer to the source to be in West Rudham from springs arising on the aptly named Wensum Farm. From the source the river flows close to the villages of South Raynham, West Raynham and East Raynham, passing Raynham Hall, home of the Marquis Townshend. The Wensum then turns and flows north through a number of small villages until it reaches Sculthorpe, where it turns east through the market town of Fakenham. The river then flows in a southeasterly direction through the Pensthorpe Nature Reserve and the village of Great Ryburgh.

The Wensum continues through or close to the villages of Guist, North Elmham, Worthing, Swanton Morley, Lyng, Lenwade and Taverham before entering the City of Norwich from the north-west via Drayton, Costessey and Hellesdon. At New Mills Yard, a former waterworks, the river becomes tidal and navigable by boat. Flowing through the city, the river forms a broad arc which would have influenced the site of the settlement for defensive reasons; remnants of boom towers can be seen near Wensum Park and Carrow Hill which formed part of the city wall and a large defensive tower can be seen on the bank near Barrack Street, called Cow Tower. This dates to the 12th century and was also used for collecting tolls. Evidence of the river&#x27;s historical use as a means of transport for goods and trade from the continent is still visible: mills, quays and industrial remnants can be found near the station and along King Street, and a slipway at Pulls Ferry marks the start of a canal originally used to transport stone from Caen in Normandy, in the 13th Century, to build Norwich Cathedral. This site was also a public house and used as a River Ferry until the 1950s.

The Wensum flows past Carrow Road football ground and then out of the city via Trowse to Whitlingham and its confluence with the River Yare. The Wensum is navigable from New Mills Yard in the centre of Norwich.

==Tributaries==
* River Tat. Rises on Syderstone Common and merges with the Wensum west of Fakenham
* River Tud. Rises a little south of East Dereham and merges with the Wensum just below Hellesdon mill.
* River Ainse. Merges with the River Wensum at Lenwade.

==Watermills==
There were a succession of water mills on the Wensum, some of which are still standing and working. From the source these are
* Sculthorpe Mill. The 18th century water mill which bridges the river was converted into a hotel and restaurant in 2003.
* Hempton Mill. The mill became derelict and was demolished in 1954 by the Drainage Board to improve control of the river levels.
* Fakenham Mill. The 18th Century water mill bridging the river was in use until 1979. It was converted into homes in 1982.
* Great Ryburgh Mill
* Guist Mill
* Bintry Mill ceased operation in 1980, but the building is still extant. It was used as the location for a film of George Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Mill on the Floss&quot; in 1996.
* North Elmham Mill, known locally as Grint Mill, had two breastshot waterwheels until the early twentieth century when they were replaced by two turbines. By the 1970s the milling machinery was driven by mains electricity while the turbines were used to drive a sack hoist and two mixing machines. The mill continued to produce animal feed into the late twentieth century.
* Swanton Morley Mill was demolished in the 1840s.
* Elsing Mill ceased operation in 1970. The building is still extant.
* Lyng Mill was demolished in 1868.
* Lenwade Mill. The Grade II listed building was at risk in the 1990s, but was sympathetically converted into apartments in 2000.
* Taverham Mill. In the 19th century Taverham was a major producer of paper. Some of the paper which was produced at Taverham Mill was used in producing &quot;The Times&quot; and the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. It also served the University Press at Cambridge. The paper mill closed in 1899.
* Costessey Mill was destroyed by a fire in 1924.
* Hellesdon Mill was demolished for building materials in 1920.
* Norwich New Mills. A corn mill was built in 1430 by public subscription. In 1710, it was rebuilt to grind corn and supply water to the city. In 1897, it became an air compressor station, with three electric and two water powered compressors. The compressed air was used to pump sewage out of the city. Operation ceased in 1972, when the only other Shone Ejector pumps in the country were those under the Houses of Parliament. Plans for it to become a working museum failed, but all the machinery is still intact. The sluice is now computer operated to control water levels.

Other mills close on tributaries are
* Great Witchingham Mill
* Gressenhall Mill
* Worthing Mill
* Felthorpe Mill

==Bridges at Norwich==

Bishops Bridge is positioned on the site of a Roman ford. Built in 1345, it is one of five medieval bridges which span the River Wensum, and was designed to form part of the defensive structure of Norwich. The bridge&#x27;s gatehouse was demolished in 1791.

Jarrold Bridge is a footbridge linking the St James Place business park to Bishopgate.

Fye Bridge is arguably the oldest river crossing in Norwich and is the gate to the North of the City known as &quot;Norwich Over the Water&quot; this bridge was also the site of a cucking stool for ducking lawbreakers and undesirables.

Whitefriars Bridge Named after a former Carmelite (White Friars) monastery. The remains of which can still be seen in a small section of medieval wall and archway.

Foundry Bridge Near the railway station and the Yacht station on Riverside named after a foundry nearby, purported to have been built to take a railway line.

Lady Julian Bridge is a footbridge named after Julian of Norwich that links Riverside to King Street.

Carrow Bridge near Carrow Road football ground is a more recent cantilevered swing bridge, which can still be opened to allow large or high vessels through. It is positioned in close proximity to the Boom towers which originally had a chain suspended between them and would have been used as part of the city&#x27;s defences and as a method of collecting tolls on goods travelling up river from Great Yarmouth.

Novi Sad Friendship Bridge is a cable stayed swing footbridge which spans the River Wensum in Norwich. The structure is named in recognition of the twinning ties between Norwich and Novi Sad in Serbia. The bridge was designed by Buro Happold and commissioned by Norfolk County Council.

There are further bridges at Barn Road, Anchor Quay, Duke Street and St. Georges Street.

==Conservation==
After many years of decline a survey was commissioned by Natural England in 2002. It showed that the ecological condition of the river had declined. The principal reasons for this were water quality and siltation. Water quality has been addressed and was improving, but the physical character of the river needs to be restored. In 2008, a partnership known as the River Wensum Restoration Strategy (RWRS) was formed between; Environment Agency; Water Management Alliance and Natural England to restore the physical functioning of the Wensum. The 2002 report found that fourteen redundant water mills along the Wensum as having the most significant factor affecting morphology of the river channel, with 67% of the river backed up behind these structures. As a priority, the strategy recommended the lowering, removal or bypassing of these structures to allow more of the river to function naturally. Since 2008, the (RWRS) has made several improvements to the river. The holistic &quot;whole river&quot; approach with co-operation from land owners, fisheries managers and other organisations has seen ongoing projects ranging from restoring gravel glides to removing silt.

The Norfolk Anglers Conservation Association (NACA) carried out a successful river habitat restoration at their Sayers Meadow fishery at Lyng in the early 1980s. After dredging and a major abstraction pipeline had a detrimental effect on the Costessey Point
fishery, the association has taken action to restore this well known water. The ongoing work will be used as a blueprint for future river conservation projects.

The Demonstration Test Catchment (DTC) project is a joint initiative between the Environment Agency, (Defra), and the Welsh Assembly Government working in three UK catchments; Hampshire Avon; River Eden, Cumbria; Wensum, Norfolk to evaluate the extent to which on-farm mitigation measures can cost-effectively reduce the impacts of diffuse water pollution on river ecology while still maintaining food production capacity (Wensum Alliance, 2014).

==Angling==
Between 1940 and the 1970s the river had a national reputation as a roach fishery with specimens exceeding being reported. As the river declined through the effects of abstraction, dredging and modern farming methods these fish largely died out. After an earlier introduction of a small amount of barbel – a fish not thought to be indigenous to the Wensum – the local river authority stocked the Wensum with over 150 fish in 1971 below Costessey Mill. and subsequently stocked more fish at suitable sections of the Upper Wensum.

<text>The Hercules Graphics Card (HGC) is a computer graphics controller formerly made by Hercules Computer Technology, Inc. that combines IBM&#x27;s text-only MDA display standard with a bitmapped graphics mode, also offering a parallel printer port. This allows the HGC to offer both high-quality text and graphics from a single card.

The HGC was very popular and became a widely supported de facto display standard on IBM PC compatibles. The HGC standard was used long after more technically capable systems had entered the market, especially on dual-monitor setups.

==History==
The Hercules Graphics Card was released to fill a gap in the IBM video product lineup. When the IBM Personal Computer was launched in 1981, it had two graphics cards available: the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) and the Monochrome Display And Printer Adapter (MDA). CGA offered low-resolution () color graphics and medium-resolution () monochrome graphics, while MDA offers a sharper text mode (equivalent to ) but has no per-pixel addressing modes and is limited to a fixed character set.

These adapters were quickly found to be inadequate by the market, creating a demand for a card that offers high-resolution graphics and text. The founder of Hercules Computer Technology, Van Suwannukul, created the Hercules Graphics Card so that he could work on his doctoral thesis on an IBM PC using the Thai alphabet, impossible with the low resolution of CGA or the fixed character set of MDA. It initially retailed in 1982 for $499.

== Hardware design ==
The original HGC is an 8-bit ISA card with 64 KB of RAM, visible on the board as eight 4164 RAM chips, and a DE-9 output compatible with the IBM monochrome monitor used with the MDA. Like the MDA, it includes a parallel interface for attaching a printer.

The video output is 5 V TTL, as with the MDA card. Nominally, the Hercules card provides a horizontal scanning frequency of 18.425 ± 0.500 kHz and 50 Hz vertical. It runs at two slightly different sets of frequencies depending on whether in text or graphics mode, providing a different vertical refresh rate and a different aspect ratio via a different pixel clock and number of scanlines.

== Capabilities ==


The Hercules card provides two modes: 
* text mode with pixel font (effective resolution of , MDA-compatible)
* graphics mode (pixel-addressable graphics)

The text mode of the Hercules card uses the same signal timing as the MDA text mode.

The Hercules graphics mode is similar to the CGA high-resolution () two-color mode; the video buffer contains a packed-pixel bitmap (eight pixels per byte, one bit per pixel) with the same byte format—including the pixel-to-bit mapping and byte order—as the CGA two-color graphics mode, and the video buffer is also split into interleaved banks, each 8 KB in size.

However, because in the Hercules graphics mode there are more than 256 scanlines and the display buffer size is nearly 32 KB (instead of 16 KB as in all CGA graphics modes), four interleaved banks are used in the Hercules mode instead of two as in the CGA modes. Also, to represent 720 pixels per line instead of 640 as on the CGA, each scanline has 90 bytes of pixel data instead of 80.

The 64 KB RAM of the HGC can hold two graphics display pages. Either page can be selected for display by setting a single bit in the Mode Control Register. Another bit, in a configuration register exclusive to the HGC, determines whether the second 32 KB of RAM on the HGC is accessible to the CPU at the base address B8000h. This bit is reset at system reset (e.g. power-on) so that the card does not conflict with a CGA or other color card at address B8000h.

== Use ==
In text mode, the HGC appears exactly like an MDA card. Graphics mode requires new techniques to use. Unlike the MDA and CGA, the PC BIOS provides no intrinsic support for the HGC. Hercules developed extensions, called &quot;HBASIC&quot;, for IBM Advanced BASIC to add HGC support and Hercules cards came with &quot;Graph X&quot;, a software library for Hercules graphical-mode support and geometric primitives.

Popular IBM PC programs such as Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet, AutoCAD computer-aided drafting, Pagemaker and Xerox Ventura desktop publishing, and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2.0 came with their own drivers to use the Hercules graphics mode.

Though the graphics mode of the Hercules card is not CGA-compatible, it is similar enough to the two CGA graphics modes that with the use of third-party terminate-and-stay-resident programs it can also work with programs written for the CGA card&#x27;s standard graphics modes. As the Hercules card does not actually have color-generating circuitry, nor can it connect to a color monitor, color appears as simulated grayscale in varying dithering patterns.

Clones of the Hercules appeared, including generic models at very low prices, usually without the printer port. Hercules advertisements implied that use of generic Hercules clones can damage the monitor.

== Reception ==
The Hercules Graphics Card was very successful, especially after Lotus 1-2-3 supported it, with one-half million units sold by 1985. Hercules Computer Technology had 18% of the graphics card market, second to IBM. Hercules-compatible graphics cards shipped as standard hardware with most PC clones. As a de facto standard, support in software was widespread.

== Card versions ==
The Hercules Graphics Card had several versions.

=== Hercules Graphics Card ===
Several updated versions of the original Hercules Graphics Card exist. The original board from 1982 is referenced as GB100, with updated versions in 1983 (GB101), 1984 (GB102) and 1988 (GB102Z).

=== Hercules Graphics Card Plus ===
The Hercules Graphics Card Plus or HGC+ (GB112) was released in June 1986 at an original retail price of $299. It was an enhancement of the HGC, adding support for redefinable fonts called RAMFONT in MDA-compatible text mode. It was based around a specialty chip designed by Hercules Computer Technology, unlike the original Hercules Graphics Card, which used standard components. Software support included Lotus 1-2-3 v2, Symphony 1.1, Framework II and Microsoft Word 3.

=== Hercules Network Card Plus ===
In 1988 Hercules released the Hercules Network Card Plus, (HNC NB112) a variant of the Graphics Card Plus with an integrated TOPS/FlashTalk-compatible network adapter. Like the HGC+, it supported RAMFONT, but lacked a printer port.

=== Hercules InColor Card ===

The InColor Card (GB222) was introduced in April 1987. It included color capabilities similar to the EGA, with 16 colors from a palette of 64. It retained the same two modes ( text with redefinable fonts and graphics), and was backward-compatible with software written for the earlier monochrome Hercules cards.

=== Hercules Color Card ===
The Hercules Color Card (GB200) was a CGA-compatible video board and should not be confused with the InColor Card. This board could coexist with the HGC and still allow both graphics pages to be used. It would detect when the second graphics page was selected and disable access to its own memory, which would otherwise have been at the same addresses. A version without printer port exists

=== Hercules Text Card ===
The Hercules Text Card was a text-only MDA clone, but offered a parallel printer port.

== Clone boards ==

<doc id="145592" wikidata="Q1780450" url="?curid=145592" title="Cantley, Norfolk">
<text>Cantley is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Cantley, Limpenhoe and Southwood, in the English county of Norfolk. 

Cantley is located north of Loddon and east of Norwich. The village is within the Broads Special Protection Area and lies on the north bank of the River Yare.

==History==
Cantley&#x27;s name is of Anglo-Saxon origin and derives from the Old English for &quot;Canta&#x27;s&quot; glade or meadow.

In the Domesday Book, Cantley is recorded as a settlement of 58 households located in the hundred of Blofield. In 1086, the village was part of the estates of King William I.

There are two historic manors, Cantley Netherhall and Cantley Uphall. Currently, the Lord of the manor of Cantley Netherhall is Franck Rallu resident in France.

In April 1935, the parish absorbed Limpenhoe and Southwood into a larger parish. In 1931, the parish (prior to the merge) had a population of 291.

== Geography ==
According to the 2021 census, Cantley has a population of 511 people which shows a slight increase from the 504 people recorded in the 2011 census.

Cantley is located along the course of the River Yare and is within the Norfolk Broads.

The majority of local children attend Cantley Primary School and is part of the Coastal Together Federation of local primary schools. In 2021, the school was rated as &#x27;Good&#x27; by Ofsted.

Cantley is served by Cantley railway station which opened in 1844 on the Yarmouth &amp; Norwich Railway. Today, the station lies on the Wherry Line with regular to Great Yarmouth, Lowestoft and Norwich.

== St. Margaret&#x27;s Church ==
Cantley&#x27;s parish church is dedicated to Saint Margaret and dates from the Fourteenth Century. St. Margaret&#x27;s is located on Church Road and has been Grade II listed since 1962. The church was significantly remodelled in the Nineteenth Century.

Within St. Margaret&#x27;s Churchyard there are two listed monuments including a tombstone with a stone coffin lid and a further coffin lid emblazoned with fleur-de-lys.

== Cantley Sugar Factory ==
In 1912 the Cantley Sugar Factory was founded by the Dutch company Algemene Suikermaatschappij (ASMij). ASMij had been founded in 1908 to concentrate the Dutch beet sugar industry and remove surplus capacity. To achieve this, it also bought the already closed down Dordrecht Sugar Factory. The machinery of this factory was then shipped to England to become part of Cantley Sugar Factory.

Cantley Sugar Factory was founded in 1912. It was not successful and closed down in 1916. After the English Beet Sugar Corporation was founded, Cantley Sugar Factory was reopened in 1920. The site is still in operation today by British Sugar, forming one of the four British sugar processing factories.

== Notable Residents ==

* Edward B. Evans (1846-1922) – army officer and stamp collector, died in Cantley.
* Fred Judd (1914-1992) – inventor and amateur radio enthusiast, lived in Cantley.
* Brian Edrich- (1922-2009) – Kent and Glamorgan cricketer, born in Cantley.
* Alfie Hewett – (b.1997) wheelchair tennis player, born in Cantley.

==Governance==
Brandiston is part of the electoral ward of Brundall for local elections and is part of the district of Broadland.

The village&#x27;s national constituency is Broadland and Fakenham which has been represented by the Conservative Party&#x27;s Jerome Mayhew MP since 2019.

<doc id="145593" wikidata="Q369657" url="?curid=145593" title="Gorleston-on-Sea">
<text>Gorleston-on-Sea (), historically and colloquially known as Gorleston, is a seaside town in the borough of Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, England. It lies to the south of Great Yarmouth, on the opposite side of the mouth of the River Yare. Historically in Suffolk, it was a port town at the time of the Domesday Book. It was incorporated into Great Yarmouth in 1836. Gorleston&#x27;s port became a centre of fishing for herring along with salt pans used for the production of salt to preserve the fish. In Edwardian times the fishing industry rapidly declined and the town&#x27;s role changed to that of a seaside resort.

==History==

The place-name &#x27;Gorleston&#x27; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &quot;Gorlestuna&quot;. It appears as &quot;Gurlestona&quot; in the Pipe Rolls of 1130. The first element may be related to the word &#x27;girl&#x27;, and is probably a personal name. The name could mean &quot;girls&#x27; town or settlement&quot;, or a variant thereof, similar to Girlington in West Yorkshire.

Historically the town was in the county of Suffolk. In the Middle Ages it had two manors, and a small manor called Bacons. The medieval church of St. Andrew stands in the town and by historical association gives its name to the Gorleston Psalter, an important example of 14th century East Anglian illuminated art. At the northern tip of the parish an area known as Southtown (also known as South Town or Little Yarmouth) grew as a suburb to Great Yarmouth, facing it across the Yare.

Gorleston Barracks were established in 1853. There were to be three railway stations in the town on the Yarmouth-Lowestoft Line. The stations on the line were Gorleston-on-Sea, Gorleston North and Gorleston Links which all closed between 1942 and 1970. The closest railway stations are now Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth.

Its main attraction is its sandy &quot;Edwardian Beach.&quot; It has traditional seaside gardens and model boat pond. It also has a theatre opposite the pier called the Pavilion. The main shopping centre is on High Street. It has its own golf club. There is also the hospital and a library. There is a lighthouse, lifeboat station and coastwatch station on Riverside Road. In 2023 the beach was voted the best in Britain, and the 12th best in Europe, by Tripadvisor reviewers.

St Peter the Apostle Roman Catholic Church, built in 1938–39, was Eric Gill&#x27;s only complete work of architecture.

In the Great Storm of 1987, Gorleston-on-Sea experienced the highest wind speed recorded in the UK on that day, which was .

The town is meticulously described in the novel &quot;Gorleston&quot; by Henry Sutton (Sceptre, 1995) and in Philip Leslie&#x27;s novels &quot;The History of Us&quot; (Legend Press, 2009) and &quot;What Remains&quot; (December House, 2013). Both Sutton and Leslie employ the actual names of roads and retail outlets in their work.

Gorleston-on-Sea&#x27;s Pier Hotel and beach feature as a key location in Danny Boyle&#x27;s 2019 film &quot;Yesterday&quot;.

===Administrative history===
Gorleston was an ancient parish in Suffolk. Southtown was brought within Great Yarmouth&#x27;s borough boundaries in 1668, whilst remaining part of the parish of Gorleston. The rest of the parish was added to the constituency of Great Yarmouth in 1832 under the Parliamentary Boundaries Act 1832. Great Yarmouth&#x27;s municipal borough boundaries were adjusted to match the constituency from 1 January 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, since when Gorleston has been administered as part of Great Yarmouth. The borough of Great Yarmouth straddled Norfolk and Suffolk between 1668 and 1891, with the original town north of the Yare being in Norfolk and Gorleston south of the Yare being in Suffolk. The borough was placed entirely in Norfolk in 1891, although as a county borough Great Yarmouth provided its own county-level services, independent from Norfolk County Council.

Gorleston continued to form a civil parish within the borough of Great Yarmouth until 1974, although as an urban parish it had no separate parish council. In 1951 the parish had a population of 24,984. On 1 April 1974 the civil parish was abolished.

==Education==
There are a number of primary schools in the area serving Gorleston and the wider locality. Secondary schools include Cliff Park Ormiston Academy, Lynn Grove Academy and Ormiston Venture Academy.

East Norfolk Sixth Form College is located in Gorleston. It is a major sixth form provider in Norfolk, attracting students from a wide area.

===East Anglian School for Deaf and Blind Children===
The East Anglian School for Deaf and Blind Children (for deaf children and for blind children) was established in Gorleston in 1912 and based there until it closed in 1985. During the Second World War the school was evacuated to Aberpergwm House in Glynneath, Wales. The headmaster&#x27;s house in Gorleston was severely damaged by bombing in 1941.

<doc id="145605" wikidata="Q214266" url="?curid=145605" title="SOS">
<text>SOS is a Morse code distress signal (), used internationally, originally established for maritime use. In formal notation SOS is written with an overscore line (), to indicate that the Morse code equivalents for the individual letters of &quot;SOS&quot; are transmitted as an unbroken sequence of three dots / three dashes / three dots, with no spaces between the letters. In International Morse Code three dots form the letter &quot;S&quot; and three dashes make the letter &quot;O&quot;, so &quot;S O S&quot; became a common way to remember the order of the dots and dashes. IWB, VZE, 3B, and V7 form equivalent sequences, but traditionally SOS is the easiest to remember.

SOS, when it was first agreed upon by the International Radio Telegraphic Convention in 1906, was merely a distinctive Morse code sequence and was initially not an abbreviation. Later a backronym was created for it in popular usage, and SOS became associated with mnemonic phrases such as &quot;Save Our Souls&quot; and &quot;Save Our Ship&quot;. Moreover, due to its high-profile use in emergencies, the phrase &quot;SOS&quot; has entered general usage to informally indicate a crisis or the need for action.

SOS originated in German government maritime radio regulations adopted effective 1 April 1905. It became a worldwide standard when it was included in the service regulations of the first International Radiotelegraph Convention signed on 3 November 1906, which became effective on 1 July 1908. In modern terminology, SOS is a Morse &quot;procedural signal&quot; or &quot;prosign, used as a start-of-message mark for transmissions requesting assistance when loss of life or catastrophic loss of property is imminent. Other prefixes are used for mechanical breakdowns, requests for medical assistance, and a relayed distress signal originally sent by another station. SOS remained the maritime radio distress signal until 1999, when it was replaced by the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System.

SOS is still recognized as a standard distress signal that may be used with any signaling method. It has been used as a visual distress signal, consisting of three short/three long/three short flashes of light, such as from a survival mirror. In some cases the individual letters &quot;S O S&quot; have been spelled out, for example, stamped in a snowbank or formed out of logs on a beach. &quot;S O S&quot; being readable upside down as well as right side up (as an ambigram) is an advantage for visual recognition.

==History==
Radio (initially known as &quot;wireless telegraphy&quot;) was developed in the late 1890s, and was quickly recognized as an important aid to maritime communication. Previously, seagoing vessels had adopted a variety of standardized visual and audio distress signals, using such things as semaphore flags, signal flares, bells, and foghorns. However, cooperation in standardizing radio distress signals was initially limited by national differences and rivalries between competing radio companies.

In 1903, an Italian representative at the Berlin Preliminary Conference on Wireless Telegraphy, Captain Quintino Bonomo, discussed the need for common operating procedures, including the suggestion that &quot;ships in distress ... should send the signal SSS DDD at intervals of a few minutes&quot;. However, procedural questions were beyond the scope of this conference, so no standard signal was adopted at the time, although Article IV of the conference&#x27;s &quot;Final Protocol&quot; stated that &quot;Wireless telegraph stations should, unless practically impossible, give priority to calls for help received from ships at sea&quot;.

Without international regulations, individual organizations were left to develop their practices. On 7 January 1904 the Marconi International Marine Communication Company issued &quot;Circular 57&quot;, which specified that, for the company&#x27;s worldwide installations, beginning 1 February 1904 &quot;the call to be given by ships in distress or in any way requiring assistance shall be C.Q.D.&quot; An alternative proposal, put forward in 1906 by the U.S. Navy, suggested that the International Code of Signals flag signals should be adopted for radio use, including NC, which stood for &quot;In distress; want immediate assistance&quot;.

Germany was the first country to adopt the distress signal, which it called the &quot;Notzeichen&quot; signal, as one of three Morse code sequences included in national radio regulations which became effective on 1 April 1905. In 1906, the first International Radiotelegraph Convention met in Berlin, which produced an agreement signed on 3 November 1906 that become effective on 1 July 1908. The convention adopted an extensive collection of Service Regulations, including Article XVI, which read: &quot;Ships in distress shall use the following signal: repeated at brief intervals&quot;.

In both the 1 April 1905 German law and the 1906 international regulations, the distress signal is specified as a continuous Morse code sequence of three dots / three dashes / three dots, with no mention of any alphabetic equivalents. However there was a convention in International Morse whereby three dots comprise the letter &quot;S&quot;, and three dashes the letter &quot;O&quot;, and it soon became common to informally refer to the distress signal as &quot;S O S&quot;, with the 12 January 1907 Electrical World stating that &quot;Vessels in distress use the special signal, SOS, repeated at short intervals.&quot; (In American Morse code, which was used by many coastal ships in the United States through the first part of the twentieth century, three dashes stood for the numeral &quot;5&quot;, so in a few cases the distress signal was informally referred to as &quot;S 5 S&quot;.)

The first ships that have been reported to have transmitted an distress call were the Cunard oceanliner on 10 June 1909 while sailing the Azores, and the steamer SS &quot;Arapahoe&quot; on 11 August 1909 while off the North Carolina coast. The signal of the &quot;Arapahoe&quot; was received by the United Wireless Telegraph Company station at Hatteras, North Carolina, and forwarded to the steamer company&#x27;s offices. However, there was some resistance among Marconi operators to adopting the new signal, and as late as the April 1912 sinking of the the ship&#x27;s Marconi operators intermixed and distress calls. In the interests of consistency and maritime safety, the use of CQD appears to have died out thereafter.

==Later developments==
Additional warning and distress signals followed the introduction of SOS. On 20 January 1914, the London International Convention on Safety of Life at Sea adopted as the &quot;Safety Signal&quot; the Morse code sequence &quot;TTT&quot; (three &quot;T&#x27;s&quot; ())—spaced normally as three letters so as not to be confused with the three dashes of the letter O ()—and used for messages to ships &quot;involving safety of navigation and being of an urgent character&quot; but short of an emergency.

===&quot;Mayday&quot; voice code===
With the development of audio radio transmitters, there was a need for a spoken distress phrase, and &quot;Mayday&quot; (from French &quot;help me&quot;) was adopted by the 1927 International Radio Convention as the spoken equivalent of SOS. For &quot;TTT&quot;, the equivalent spoken signal is &quot;Sécurité&quot; (from French &quot;safety&quot;) for navigational safety, while &quot;Pan-pan&quot; (from French &quot;breakdown&quot;; Morse &quot;XXX&quot;) signals an urgent but not immediately dangerous situation. French was the international language at the time that these were formalized.

===World War II suffix codes===
During World War II, additional codes were employed to include immediate details about attacks by enemy vessels, especially in the Battle of the Atlantic. The signal &quot;SSS&quot; signaled attacked by submarines, while &quot;RRR&quot; warned of an attack by a surface raider, &quot;QQQ&quot; warned of an unknown raider (usually an auxiliary cruiser), and &quot;AAA&quot; indicated an attack by aircraft. They were usually sent in conjunction with the SOS distress signal. All of these codes later switched from three repeats of the letter to four repeats, e.g., &quot;RRRR&quot;.

None of these signals was used on its own. Sending SOS as well as the urgency signal (&quot;XXX&quot; in CW, and &quot;PAN-PAN&quot; in voice) and safety signal (&quot;TTT&quot; in CW, and &quot;SECURITE&quot; in voice) used similar procedures for effectiveness. 

===Audio tone signals and automatic alarms===
Ships and coastal stations would normally have required quiet times twice an hour to listen for priority signals, for 3 minutes, at different times for 500 kHz and 2182 kHz.

Since many merchant vessels carried only one or two radio operators, no one might hear a distress signal when both operators were off-duty. Eventually, equipment was invented to summon operators by ringing an alarm in the operator&#x27;s cabin, and on the bridge, and the only switch able to disable the alarm was only permitted to be in the wireless telegraph room. The alarm was sent by the operator on the ship in distress transmitting the radiotelegraph alarm signal (auto-alarm) signal—twelve extra-long dashes, each lasting four seconds with a one-second gap between them, and transmitted in A2 (modulated CW). The alarm signal was normally sent with a mechanical or electronic timing circuit to ensure it was sent accurately. However, ships radio room clocks typically had markings on the dial to guide operators in sending the signal manually. The regulations for the auto-alarm were defined in the 1927 &quot;Safety of Life at Sea&quot; (SOLAS) international maritime regulations, and in Article 19, § 21, of the General Regulations annexed to the &quot;International Radiotelegraph Convention&quot;, 1927.5 5.

The Auto Alarm receivers were designed to activate upon receiving four such dashes. Once four valid dashes are detected, the automatic alarm is activated. The distressed ship&#x27;s operator would then delay sending the SOS message itself to give off-watch radio operators time to reach their radio room.

The radiotelephony equivalent of the radiotelegraph alarm signal is the radiotelephony alarm signal, which is the transmission of alternating tones of 2200 Hz and 1300 Hz, with each tone having a duration of 250 ms. Automatic alarm systems aboard ships must activate when such a signal is received and the receiving vessel is within of the transmitting vessel&#x27;s position, or if the distress position is in the polar areas (latitude greater than 70° N or 70° S). The alarm should also activate when the call is received and the distance between the vessel in distress and the receiving vessel cannot be determined.

<doc id="145606" wikidata="Q1089523" url="?curid=145606" title="Chumbawamba">
<text>Chumbawamba () was a British anarcho-punk band who formed in 1982 and disbanded in 2012. They are best known for their 1997 single &quot;Tubthumping&quot;, which was nominated for Best British Single at the Brit Awards 1998. Other singles include &quot;Amnesia&quot;, &quot;Enough Is Enough&quot; (with Credit to the Nation), &quot;Timebomb&quot;, &quot;Top of the World (Olé, Olé, Olé)&quot;, and &quot;Add Me&quot;. Their anarcho-communist political leanings led them to have an irreverent attitude toward authority, and to espouse a variety of political and social causes including animal rights and pacifism (early in their career) and later regarding class struggle, Marxism, feminism, and anti-fascism.

For most of their career, the band had a 7–8 piece lineup and drew from a wide range of musical styles, including punk rock, pop, and folk. While their first two albums were largely punk and pop-influenced, their third was an entirely a capella album of traditional songs. In 2004, several long-term members left the band, which continued with a 4-piece (later 5-piece) acoustic lineup, with more folk-influenced output.

In July 2012, Chumbawamba announced they were splitting up after 30 years. The band was joined by former members and collaborators for three final shows between 31 October and 3 November 2012, one of which was filmed and released as a live DVD.

==Band history==

===Early years (1982–84)===

Chumbawamba formed in Burnley in 1982 with an initial line-up of Allan &quot;Boff&quot; Whalley, Danbert Nobacon (born Nigel Hunter), and Midge, all three previously members of the band Chimp Eats Banana, shortly afterwards joined by Lou Watts. The band made their live debut in January 1982. Their first vinyl release was a track (&quot;Three Years Later&quot;) on the Crass Records compilation album &quot;Bullshit Detector 2&quot;. They were initially inspired musically by bands as diverse as the Fall, PiL, Wire, and Adam and the Ants and politically by the anarchist stance of Crass. Another of the band&#x27;s early releases was under the name &quot;Skin Disease&quot;, parodying the Oi! bands of the time so successfully that they were included on &quot;Back On The Streets&quot;, an Oi! compilation EP put together by &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine journalist Garry Bushell. 

By the end of 1982, the band had expanded to include Alice Nutter (of Ow My Hair&#x27;s on Fire), and Dunstan &quot;Dunst&quot; Bruce (of Men in a Suitcase) and were living in a squat in Armley, Leeds, on Carr Crofts road. Harry &quot;Daz&quot; Hamer and Mavis &quot;Mave&quot; Dillon (aka David Mills, Man Afraid) - members, along with Whalley, of Barnsley punk band Passion Killers - joined soon after. Simon &quot;Commonknowledge&quot; Lanzon, who had been a member of Donovan&#x27;s band Open Road in the early 1970s, appeared on most of the band&#x27;s early releases but was not usually listed as a band member.

Stalwarts of the cassette culture scene, the band released a number of tapes on their own Sky and Trees Records including &quot;Be Happy Despite It All&quot; - a split compilation with Passion Killers - and &quot;Raising Heck With Chumbawamba&quot;, and were featured on many compilations. Chumbawamba were at the forefront of the 1980s anarcho-punk movement, frequently playing benefit gigs in squats and small halls for causes such as animal rights, the anti-war movement, and community groups. The band&#x27;s collective political views are often described as anarchism or anarcho-communist. They made several songs about the UK miners&#x27; strike, including the cassette &quot;Common Ground&quot; and a song dedicated to the pit village of Fitzwilliam, which was one of the worst cases of economic decline following the strike.

===With Agit-Prop Records (1985–89)===
By the mid-1980s Chumbawamba had begun to release material using the vinyl format on their own Agit-Prop record label, which had evolved from an earlier project, Sky and Trees Records. The first release was the &quot;Revolution&quot; EP in 1985, which quickly sold out of its initial run, and was re-pressed, reaching No. 4 in the UK Indie Chart, and staying in the chart for 34 weeks. The first LP, &quot;Pictures of Starving Children Sell Records&quot; (1986), was a critique of the Live Aid concert organised by Bob Geldof, which the band argued was primarily a cosmetic spectacle designed to draw attention away from the real political causes of world hunger.

The band toured Europe with Dutch band the Ex, and a collaboration between members of the two bands, under the name &quot;Antidote&quot;, led to the release of an EP, &quot;Destroy Fascism!&quot;, inspired by hardcore punk band Heresy, with whom they had also toured. Both the Ex and Chumbawamba were released on cassette tape in Poland during this period, when music censorship was entrenched in Iron Curtain nations. The &quot;RED&quot; label, based in Wrocław in south-west Poland during the late 1980s, only released cassette tapes and, despite the limits enforced by Polish authorities, was able to release Chumbawamba&#x27;s music, in addition to bands from the USSR, East Germany and Czechoslovakia.

Chumbawamba&#x27;s second album, &quot;Never Mind the Ballots...Here&#x27;s the Rest of Your Lives&quot;, was released in 1987, coinciding with the general election, and questions the validity of the British democratic system of the time. The band adopted another moniker, Scab Aid, for the &quot;Let It Be&quot; song release that parodied a version of the Beatles song recorded by the popstar supergroup Ferry Aid to raise money for victims of the Zeebrugge ferry disaster.

The 1988 album &quot;English Rebel Songs 1381–1914&quot; was a recording of traditional songs.

===With One Little Indian Records (1990–96)===
By the late 1980s and early 1990s, Chumbawamba had begun to absorb influences from techno music and rave culture. The band members quit their day jobs to begin concentrating on music full-time as they could now guarantee sales of 10,000 and they moved away from their original anarcho-punk roots, evolving a pop sensibility with releases such as &quot;Slap!&quot; (1990) and the sample-heavy &quot;Shhh&quot; (1992) (originally intended to be released as &quot;Jesus H Christ!&quot;, this album had to be withdrawn and re-recorded because of copyright problems). They also toured the United States for the first time in 1990.

When Jason Donovan took &quot;The Face&quot; magazine to court that same year for claiming he was lying by denying he was gay, Chumbawamba responded by printing up hundreds of &quot;Jason Donovan – Queer As Fuck&quot; T-shirts and giving them away free with the single &quot;Behave&quot;.

After signing to the independent One Little Indian record label, &quot;Anarchy&quot; (1994) lyrically remained as politically uncompromising as ever, continuing to address issues such as homophobia (see song &quot;Homophobia&quot;, the music video of which features the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence), the Criminal Justice Act and the rise of fascism in the UK following the election of Derek Beackon, a British National Party councillor in south-east London in 1993.
The album was the band&#x27;s biggest success to date, reaching the top 30 in the UK and the singles &quot;Timebomb&quot; and &quot;Enough Is Enough&quot; both entering the low end of the UK Singles Chart. The latter featured Credit to the Nation&#x27;s rapper MC Fusion. The live shows to support the album were recorded and went to make up their first live album &quot;Showbusiness!&quot;, released in 1995.
One Little Indian also re-released Chumbawamba&#x27;s back catalogue, which meant that the first three albums were released on CD for the first time. The first two, &quot;Pictures of Starving Children Sell Records&quot; (1985) and &quot;Never Mind the Ballots&quot; (1987), were repackaged as one disc under the title &quot;First 2&quot;.

Chumbawamba parted with One Little Indian during the recording of the 1996 album &quot;Swingin&#x27; with Raymond&quot;, although they did release one last CD entitled &quot;Portraits of Anarchists&quot;, which came with copies of Casey Orr&#x27;s book of the same name.

===With EMI Records (1997–2001)===
==== Controversy over EMI signing ====
Chumbawamba signed to EMI in Europe in 1997, a move that was viewed as controversial by many of their followers. They had been involved with a compilation LP called &quot;Fuck EMI&quot; in 1989, and had criticised the label in many of their earlier songs. 

The anarcho-punk band Oi Polloi (with whom Chumbawamba had previously toured and worked with on the &#x27;Punk Aid&#x27; &quot;Smash the Poll Tax&quot; EP ) released an &#x27;anti-Chumbawamba&#x27; split EP with Riot/Clone, Bus Station Loonies, Anxiety Society, The Chineapple Punks, Love Chips and Peas, and Wat Tyler, called &quot;Bare Faced Hypocrisy Sells Records&quot; (Ruptured Ambitions 1998). 

Chumbawamba argued that EMI had severed the link with weapons manufacturer Thorn a few years previously, and that experience had taught them that, in a capitalist environment, almost every record company operates on capitalist principles: &quot;Our previous record label One Little Indian didn&#x27;t have the evil symbolic significance of EMI however they were completely motivated by profit.&quot; They added that this move brought with it the opportunity to make the band financially viable as well as to communicate their message to a wider audience.

====&quot;Tubthumper&quot; - mainstream success and political controversy (1997–99)====
In 1997, Chumbawamba scored their biggest chart hit with &quot;Tubthumping&quot; (UK No. 2, US No. 6), which featured an audio sample of actor Pete Postlethwaite&#x27;s performance in the film &quot;Brassed Off&quot; on the album version. 

The single was followed by the album &quot;Tubthumper&quot;, which incorporated elements of pop rock, dance-pop, and alternative rock. The album was the first to feature Jude Abbott on trumpet, wind instruments and vocals, replacing Mavis Dillon.

In early 1998 with &quot;Amnesia&quot; was released as the second single from the album, and reached No. 10 in the UK. During this period Chumbawamba gained some notoriety over several controversial incidents, starting in August 1997 when Nutter was quoted in the British music paper &quot;Melody Maker&quot; as saying, &quot;Nothing can change the fact that we like it when cops get killed.&quot; The comment was met with outrage in Britain&#x27;s tabloid press and was condemned by the Police Federation of England and Wales. The band resisted pressure from EMI to issue an apology and Nutter only clarified her comment by stating, &quot;If you&#x27;re working class they won&#x27;t protect you. When you hear about them, it&#x27;s in the context of them abusing people, y&#x27;know, miscarriages of justice. We don&#x27;t have a party when cops die, you know we don&#x27;t.&quot;

In January 1998 Nutter appeared on the American political talk show &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; and advised fans of their music who could not afford to buy their CDs to steal them from large chains such as HMV and Virgin, which prompted Virgin to remove the album from the shelves and start selling it from behind the counter.

A few weeks later, provoked by the Labour government&#x27;s refusal to support the Liverpool Dockworkers&#x27; Strike, the band performed &quot;Tubthumping&quot; at the 1998 BRIT Awards with the lyric changed to include &quot;New Labour sold out the dockers, just like they&#x27;ll sell out the rest of us&quot;, and vocalist Danbert Nobacon later poured a jug of water over UK Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, who was in the audience.

In the late 1990s, the band turned down $1.5 million from Nike to use the song &quot;Tubthumping&quot; in a World Cup advertisement. According to the band, the decision took approximately &quot;30 seconds&quot; to make.

In the EA Sports soccer game &quot;World Cup 98&quot;, the song &quot;Tubthumping&quot; is one of the soundtrack titles.

In 2002, General Motors paid Chumbawamba a sum of either $70,000 or $100,000 to use the song &quot;Pass It Along&quot; from the &quot;WYSIWYG&quot; album for a Pontiac Vibe television advertisement. Chumbawamba gave the money to the anti-corporate activist groups Indymedia and CorpWatch, who used the money to launch an information and environmental campaign against GM.

EMI released the band&#x27;s first collection album which featured a mixed bag of songs from between 1985 and 1998 under the title &quot;Uneasy Listening&quot;.

Also in 1998 came a Japan-only mini album, &quot;Amnesia&quot;, consisting of country and western style versions of recent hits &quot;Tubthumping&quot; and &quot;Amnesia&quot; alongside earlier songs like &quot;Mouthful of Shit&quot;.

In 1998, Chumbawamba also contributed to the album released by the Polish &quot;Never Again&quot; Association as a part of its Music Against Racism campaign. In 2021 the album was reissued as vinyl record &quot;One Race – Human Race. Music Against Racism: Part 2&quot;.

As a millennium present, Chumbawamba sent out a limited edition single to everyone on their mailing list. The song was a shoop-shoop-style ballad, &quot;Tony Blair&quot;, which read like a heartbroken letter to an ex-lover who had broken all his promises. The band would send another free single out two years later, this time a re-worked version of the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Her Majesty&quot; to coincide with the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, with lyrics denouncing royalty.

==== &quot;WYSIWYG&quot; and leaving EMI (2000–01) ====

Chumbawamba released the album &quot;WYSIWYG&quot; in 2000, which included a cover of the early Bee Gees song &quot;New York Mining Disaster&quot;. The single &quot;She&#x27;s Got All The Friends That Money Can Buy&quot; was backed by &quot;Passenger List For Doomed Flight 1721&quot;, a song that listed all of the people that the band would like to see &quot;disappear&quot;. The list of unfortunates included Tony Blair, Ally McBeal and Bono. Chumbawamba parted from EMI in 2001. The band later said that they got what they wanted from the deal with EMI: &quot;we released some great records, we travelled all over the world, appeared on all these TV programmes, and we made loads of money, a lot of which we gave away or ploughed into worthwhile causes&quot;.

To celebrate their 20 years together, the band made a documentary film based on footage that they had recorded over the past two decades. Originally intended to be simply a compilation of their videos, the result was entitled &quot;Well Done, Now Sod off&quot;. The title was taken from an early review of a Chumbawamba record and the film included both lovers and haters of the band.

=== With Mutt Records (2002–04)===

Chumbawamba formed Mutt Records, their own record label, in 2002. It released their albums &quot;Readymades&quot; (2002), &quot;Revenger&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; (2003 soundtrack), and &quot;Un&quot; (2004).

=== With No Masters Records (2005–11)===

In 2005, Chumbawamba moved to a cut-down acoustic lineup. This saw the departure of long-time members Danbert Nobacon, Alice Nutter, Harry Hamer and Dunstan Bruce, leaving a 4-person lineup featuring founder members Lou Watts and Boff Whalley with later additions Jude Abbott and long-term producer Neil Ferguson. 

No Masters Records released Chumbawamba&#x27;s &quot;A Singsong and a Scrap&quot; in 2005.

In 2007, Chumbawamba played at the Glastonbury Festival. In early 2007, the band announced via their website that a new album was in the works, stating that &quot;the new album will be acoustic and probably won&#x27;t sound like &quot;A Singsong and a Scrap&quot;&quot;.

The result was &quot;The Boy Bands Have Won&quot;, released on 3 March 2008 in the UK and 14 March in mainland Europe. The record contained 25 tracks, some of them full-length songs, some of them no more than a minute long and was again acoustic folk in style. The album is the debut of Phil Moody as a band member, and features the Oysterband, Roy Bailey and Barry Coope amongst others.

In late 2009 Chumbawamba toured northern England in their self-penned pantomime, a comedy musical entitled &quot;Riot, Rebellion &amp; Bloody Insurrection&quot; with the Red Ladder Theatre Company. In late February 2010 they released their 15th album, titled &quot;ABCDEFG&quot;.

In September 2011, past and present band members protested when the UK Independence Party used &quot;Tubthumping&quot; at their annual conference.

===Break-up and post-breakup activities (2012–present)===
On 8 July 2012, Chumbawamba announced that they would be disbanding at the end of the year. On their website they opened the statement with &quot;That&#x27;s it then, it&#x27;s the end. With neither a whimper, a bang or a reunion.&quot; They stated they would continue with individual efforts, and ended their official statement:

We do, of course, reserve the right to re-emerge as Chumbawamba doing something else entirely (certainly not touring and putting out albums every 2 or 3 years). But frankly, that&#x27;s not very likely. Thirty years of being snotty, eclectic, funny, contrary and just plain weird. What a privilege, and what a good time we&#x27;ve had.
In December 2012, the final UK show, filmed at the Leeds City Varieties on Halloween night, was released as Chumbawamba&#x27;s only live DVD, entitled &quot;Going, Going – Live at Leeds City Varieties&quot;.

A mail-order EP, &quot;In Memoriam: Margaret Thatcher&quot;, was released on 8 April 2013. The CD had been recorded around 2005 and made available for pre-order at gigs and on the group&#x27;s website, to be issued upon the death of Margaret Thatcher.

==== Post-breakup band member activities ====

After leaving Chumbawamba, vocalist Dunstan Bruce founded Dandy Films, an independent film and video company whose projects have included a &quot;video blog&quot; of the Levellers&#x27; UK tour during 2010 and Sham 69&#x27;s tour of China.

In 2012 former Chumbawamba members Dunstan Bruce and Harry Hamer formed a new band, Interrobang?!, with guitarist Stephen Griffin of London-based Regular Fries.

In August 2017, Dunstan Bruce, Boff Whalley and Jude Abbott were interviewed on BBC&#x27;s &quot;The One Show&quot; from the Leeds City Varieties and near their former home celebrating 20 years since the release of &quot;Tubthumping&quot;.

Chumbawamba is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism and participated in a 2018 Radio PSA for them.

Former member Alice Nutter has had a number of plays performed at the Leeds Playhouse, where she took a writing course in 2006. A neon sculpture on the side of the theatre features the lyric &quot;I get knocked down but I get up again&quot; from the band&#x27;s single &quot;Tubthumping&quot;.

==== Documentary ====
On 1 July 2015 Dunstan Bruce started a Kickstarter to fund a documentary titled &quot;I Get Knocked Down (The Untold Story of Chumbawamba)&quot; that told the band&#x27;s entire history from different members&#x27; perspective. He surpassed his £40,000 goal. That same year, Chumbawamba was the featured subject on two podcasts produced by Gimlet Media: &quot;StartUp&quot; #16 &quot;The Secret Formula&quot; and &quot;Surprisingly Awesome&quot; #4 &quot;Tubthumping&quot;.

==Musical style and legacy==

Chumbawamba has been described as various genres including, anarcho-punk, pop, folk, world, dance, alternative rock pop rock, electronic, rock, and a cappella.

In an interview with The Guardian in 2016, the band was cited along with a number of other British Anarcho-punk bands of the early 80s as being an influence to the American avant-garde metal group Neurosis.

===Use of &quot;Tubthumping&quot; by the right===
Boff Whalley has written that in the early days of his 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump had used &quot;Tubthumping&quot; in his rallies; the group denied him the right to do so. Whalley said that &quot;There have been many, many examples of rightwing populist leaders using ostensibly leftwing music to hoodwink their audiences into some kind of hypnotic self-delusion that they are &#x27;of the people&#x27;.&quot; 

Relatedly, in 2024, Chumbawamba made headlines in New Zealand, when Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters used &quot;Tubthumping&quot; throughout his election campaign and during his state of the nation speech. Peters argued against addressing Māori inequality, gender and sexuality lessons in the school curriculum and compared co-governance (shared decision-making between Māori and the Crown) to the race-based theories of Nazi Germany. Chumbawamba spoke out, stating they had not given permission to use their song. In March 2024, the band issued a &quot;cease and desist&quot; order against Peters.

In a statement, Boff Whalley said, &quot;Tubthumping&quot; was written &quot;as a song of hope and positivity, so it seems entirely odd that the &#x27;I get knocked down...&#x27; refrain is being used by New Zealand&#x27;s deputy prime minister Winston Peters as he barks his divisive, small-minded, bigoted policies during his recent speeches&quot;.

<text>The River Tyne is a river in North East England. Its length (excluding tributaries) is . It is formed by the North Tyne and the South Tyne, which converge at Warden near Hexham in Northumberland at a place dubbed &#x27;The Meeting of the Waters&#x27;.
The Tyne Rivers Trust measure the whole Tyne catchment as , containing of waterways.

==Course==
===North Tyne===
The Ordnance Survey records &#x27;the source of the North Tyne river&#x27; at grid reference NY 605974 at Deadwater, a few tens of metres short of the Scottish border. It flows southeast through the village of Kielder before entering first Bakethin Reservoir and then Kielder Water, both set within Kielder Forest. It then passes by the village of Bellingham before the River Rede enters as a left-bank tributary at Redesmouth. It passes Hadrian&#x27;s Wall near Chollerford before joining the South Tyne near Warden to the northwest of Hexham. 
===South Tyne===
The South Tyne rises at Tyne Head on Alston Moor, Cumbria close to the sources of the Tees and the Wear. Initially it flows north through the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), enters Northumberland downstream of Alston and turns to the east as it approaches the town of Haltwhistle. Paralleling Hadrian&#x27;s Wall which lies to the north, the river continues past Redburn and Haydon Bridge to join the North Tyne at Warden. This low level east-west corridor through the Pennines is referred to as the Tyne Gap.

===Tyne===
From the confluence of the North and South Tyne at Warden, the river flows east through Northumberland by Hexham, Corbridge and Prudhoe and enters the county of Tyne and Wear to the east of Wylam. The river subsequently forms the boundary between Newcastle upon Tyne on the north bank and the Borough of Gateshead on the south bank for , in the course of which it flows under ten bridges. To the east of Gateshead and Newcastle, the Tyne divides Hebburn and Jarrow on the south bank from Walker and Wallsend on the north bank. The Tyne Tunnel runs under the river to link Jarrow and Wallsend. Finally the river flows between South Shields and Tynemouth into the North Sea.

==Geography==
Thomas John Taylor (1810–1861) theorised that the main course of the river anciently flowed through what is now Team Valley, its outlet into the tidal river being by a waterfall at Bill Point (in the area of Bill Quay). His theory was not far from the truth, as there is evidence that prior to the last ice age, the River Wear once followed the current route of the lower River Team and merged with the Tyne at Dunston. Ice diverted the course of the Wear to its current location, flowing east the course of the Tyne) and joining the North Sea at Sunderland.

The River Tyne is estimated to be around 30 million years old.

==Conservation==
The conservation of the Tyne has been handled by various bodies over the past 500 years. Conservation bodies have included: Newcastle Trinity House, and the Tyne Improvement Commission. The Tyne Improvement Commission conservation lasted from 1850 until 1968. The 1850–1950 era was the worst period for pollution of the river. The Tyne Improvement Commission laid the foundations for what has become the modern day Port of Tyne. Under the management of the Tyne Improvement Commissioners, over a period of the first 70 years the Tyne was deepened from and had 150 million tonnes dredged from it. Inside these 70 years, the two Tyne piers were built; Northumbrian, Tyne and Albert Docks were built, as well as the staithes at Whitehill and Dunston. This infrastructure enabled millions of tonnes of cargo to be handled by the Port by 1910. 
The tidal river has been managed by the Port of Tyne Authority since 1968.

The River Tyne has a charity dedicated to protecting and enhancing its waters and surrounding areas. The Tyne Rivers Trust, established in 2004, is a community-based organisation that works to improve habitat, promote better understanding of the Tyne catchment area and build the reputation of the Tyne catchment as a place of environmental excellence.

==Port of Tyne==
With its proximity to surrounding coalfields, the Tyne was a major route for the export of coal from the 13th century until the decline of the coal mining industry in North East England in the second half of the 20th century. The largest coal staithes (a structure for loading coal onto ships) were located at Dunston in Gateshead, Hebburn and Tyne Dock, South Shields. The wooden staithes at Dunston, built in 1890, have been preserved, although they were partially destroyed by fire in 2006 and then a further fire in May 2020 means that the Staithes is becoming more vulnerable to vandalism and would need extensive financing to preserve it and make it secure. In 2016, Tyne Dock, South Shields was still involved with coal, importing 2 million tonnes of shipments a year. The lower reaches of the Tyne were, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, one of the world&#x27;s most important centres of shipbuilding, and there are still shipyards in South Shields and Hebburn to the south of the river. To support the shipbuilding and export industries of Tyneside, the lower reaches of the river were extensively remodelled during the second half of the 19th century, with islands (including Kings Meadow, the largest) removed and meanders in the river straightened.

==Name and etymology==
Nothing definite is known of the origin of the designation &quot;Tyne&quot;, nor is the river known by that name until the Saxon period: Tynemouth is recorded in Anglo-Saxon as (probably dative case). The &quot;Vedra&quot; on the Roman map of Britain may be the Tyne, or may be the River Wear. Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Tína&quot; could be a &quot;misplaced reference&quot; to either this river or the Tyne in East Lothian. There is a theory that was a word that meant &quot;river&quot; in the local Celtic language or in a language spoken in England before the Celts came: compare Tardebigge.

A supposed pre-Celtic root &quot;*tei&quot;, meaning &#x27;to melt, to flow&#x27; has also been proposed as an etymological explanation of the Tyne and similarly named rivers, as has a Brittonic derivative of Indo-European &quot;*teihx&quot;, meaning &#x27;to be dirty&#x27; (Welsh &quot;tail&quot;, &#x27;manure&#x27;).

The river is represented, and personified, in a sculpture unveiled in 1968 as part of the new Civic Centre (seat of Newcastle City Council). Sculpted by David Wynne, the massive bronze figure &quot;River God Tyne&quot; incorporates flowing water into its design.

===Salmon Trail===
The Environment Agency is currently working with architects and cultural consultancy xsite, in collaboration with Commissions North, to create a travelling sculpture trail along the River Tyne.

The Tyne Salmon Trail will serve as a celebration of the river, its heritage and its increasingly diverse ecosystem. Historically a major symbol in the regional identity of the North East of England, the river plays host to a plethora of different species, the number of which is growing year on year in line with the rivers improving health.
The trail looks to capture the imagination of residents and tourists visiting the area – providing them with the ultimate &#x27;fact finding&#x27; design experience, which celebrates the salmon&#x27;s migratory journey in the Northeast of England.

FINS, REFLECTION and JOURNEY were the first three cubes to be launched in December 2007 from a family of ten. Each cube is inspired by the textures, changing colours, movement and journey of the salmon. With each offering a &#x27;modern day keepsake&#x27; to take away, in the form of a designed Bluetooth message.

The other cubes will be moving along the River Tyne over one year visiting different locations from Kielder to the Mouth of the Tyne in the summer 2008 before starting their long journey back to their birthplace.

===Conversation Piece===
===Bamboo Bridge===
For three days, from 18 to 20 July 2008, a temporary bamboo artwork was installed over the Tyne close to the Gateshead Millennium Bridge. The Bambuco Bridge was created as part of that year&#x27;s &#x27;SummerTyne&#x27; festival.

<doc id="145608" wikidata="Q1168382" url="?curid=145608" title="The Face Behind the Mask (1941 film)">
<text>The Face Behind the Mask is a 1941 American Film Noir directed by Robert Florey and starring Peter Lorre, Evelyn Keyes and Don Beddoe. The screenplay was adapted by Paul Jarrico, Arthur Levinson, and Allen Vincent from the play &quot;Interim&quot;, written by Thomas Edward O&#x27;Connell (1915–1961).

==Plot==
Janos Szabo (Peter Lorre) is a hopeful new Hungarian immigrant who, on his first day in New York City, is trapped in a hotel fire that leaves his face hideously scarred. He is refused employment due to his appearance and, though possessing tremendous skill as a watchmaker, is willing to do any work. In extreme poverty, and despite believing that dishonesty can never bring happiness, he resorts to safecracking to obtain food, medicine, and a warm bed for his only friend, Dinky (George E. Stone). Eventually he becomes the leader of a gang of thieves and raises money to commission and wear a realistic latex mask of his own face.

Janos then falls in love with Helen (Evelyn Keyes), a blind woman who perceives only the good in him, and attempts to leave his life of crime behind him. Unfortunately, his gang come to believe that he has betrayed them to the police, and attempt to kill him by car bomb, an attempt on his life that he survives but which kills Helen. In retaliation, Janos disguises himself as the pilot of the private plane in which the gang plans to fly out of the country. He lands the plane in the Arizona desert and lets out the fuel, suicidally stranding both the gang and himself without food or water, dooming them all to a slow death. At the film&#x27;s end, Janos&#x27;s body and those of his enemies are discovered by the police.

==Cast==
* Peter Lorre as Janos &quot;Johnny&quot; Szabo
* Evelyn Keyes as Helen Williams
* Don Beddoe as Lt. Jim O&#x27;Hara
* George E. Stone as Dinky
* John Tyrrell as Watts
* Stanley Brown as Harry
* Cy Schindell as Benson (as Al Seymour)
* James Seay as Jeff Jeffries
* Warren Ashe as Johnson, Reporter
* Charles C. Wilson as Chief O&#x27;Brien (as Charles Wilson)
* George McKay as Terry Finnegan

==Production==
&quot;The Face Behind the Mask&quot; was directed by French-American director Robert Florey, and written by Paul Jarrico, and Allen Vincent. The film is based on the radio play &quot;The Interim&quot; by Thomas Edward O&#x27;Connell. Florey previously made contributions to Universal Pictures&#x27; 1931 film &quot;Frankenstein&quot; before James Whale was brought on as director, and he had directed &quot;Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;. The film&#x27;s script was specifically written with Peter Lorre in mind for the film&#x27;s lead role, with parallels to Lorre&#x27;s own life, as co-writer Jarrico recalled &quot;The script was &#x27;tailored&#x27;, as I recall, in a sense Lorre had already been cast.&quot; Lorre was cast in the film&#x27;s lead role of Janos &quot;Johnny&quot; Szabo as the first of a two-picture deal that he was contracted to make for Columbia Pictures. Evelyn Keyes, who had starred in Victor Fleming&#x27;s &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, was cast as Janos&#x27; love interest Helen Williams. Actors Don Beddoe, George E. Stone, John Tyrrell, and Cy Schindell were cast in secondary roles for the film. Tyrell and Schindell were both regulars at Columbia Pictures and were well-known for starring in the studio&#x27;s Three Stooges short films.

Principal photography began on November 6, 1940, lasting for 20 days.

==Release==
===Theatrical release===
&quot;The Face Behind the Mask&quot; had its official premiere on January 16, 1941.

==Reception==

&quot;The Face Behind the Mask&quot; was poorly received during its initial release. In its 1941 review of the film, &quot;The New York Times&quot; was critical of the film, writing &quot;Despite a certain pretentiousness toward things psychological, &quot;The Face Behind the Mask&quot; may safely be set down as just another bald melodramatic exercise in which the talents of Peter Lorre again are stymied by hackneyed dialogue and conventional plot manipulations.&quot;

Later reviews of the film have been more positive. Blockbuster Inc.&#x27;s &quot;Guide to Movies and Videos&quot; rated the film three out of four stars, praising the film&#x27;s direction, premise, and performances.
Leonard Maltin awarded the film three out of a possible four stars, calling the film &quot;Extremely well done on slim budget&quot;. Dennis Schwartz from &quot;Ozus&#x27; World Movie Reviews&quot; gave the film a &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale, calling it &quot;a horror story in that it offers a vision of the American Dream turning ugly and wrong.&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot; rated the film two out of four stars, calling it &quot;A stylish film about human suffering&quot;.

<text>Christopher John Tarrant (born 10 October 1946) is a retired English broadcaster, television personality, radio DJ and stand up comedian. He is best known for presenting the ITV children&#x27;s television show &quot;Tiswas&quot; from 1974 to 1981, and the game show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; from its inception in 1998 until 2014.

Tarrant&#x27;s career began in 1972, when he was hired by the television broadcaster, ATV. He presented &quot;ATV Today,&quot; a current affairs programme serving the Midlands area of England, until 1982. Tarrant rose to prominence after becoming a co-host on &quot;Tiswas&quot;, the children&#x27;s television show broadcast on a Saturday morning from 1974 to 1981. Tarrant was a member of the Four Bucketeers group, whose single &quot;Bucket Of Water Song&quot; reached No. 26 in the UK Singles Chart in 1980. In January 1982, along with Bob Carolgees, John Gorman, Randolph Sutherland and Lenny Henry, Tarrant launched a late-night show, &quot;O.T.T.&quot; (&quot;Over the Top&quot;), thought of as an &quot;adult&quot; version of &quot;Tiswas&quot;, which despite being short-lived, was very popular amongst adults. His co-host Sally James presented the concurrent and final series of &quot;Tiswas&quot; alone.

Tarrant was a Capital Radio host from 1984 to 2004, presenting the early-morning show &quot;Capital Breakfast&quot;. The show was highly popular, increasing Capital Radio&#x27;s audience share in London. Tarrant presented the ITV game show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; from 1998 to 2014, while also providing some audio recordings for some console games, and a tabletop game made by Tiger Electronics based on the show. He recorded a total of 592 episodes across 30 series, in which a total of five contestants won the cash prize of £1 million. In 2012, Tarrant began a travel documentary series, &quot;Chris Tarrant: Extreme Railways,&quot; with locations including the Congo-Ocean Railway, the Ghan across Australia and the Konkan Railway in India.

Tarrant&#x27;s other television credits include &quot;Tarrant on TV&quot;, a programme which shows clips featuring a number of unusual television programmes from around the world, and &quot;Tarrant Lets the Kids Loose&quot;, a programme which gives three- to six-year-olds the chance to fulfil their greatest ambitions in the adult world. He also hosted several other game shows including &quot;It&#x27;s Not What You Know&quot; and &quot;The Colour of Money.&quot; Tarrant received an OBE in 2004 for his charity work, in particular his campaigning on behalf of disadvantaged children. Tarrant announced his retirement in December 2024 after 52 years in television.

==Early life==
Christopher John Tarrant was born on 10 October 1946 in Reading, England, to father Basil and mother Joan Tarrant. His father had joined a territorial unit of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps in 1936 and was among those evacuated from Dunkirk in the retreat of May 1940. He was also active in the Normandy landings. 

Tarrant was educated as a boarder in Choir House at the King&#x27;s School, Worcester from 1960 to 1964. He represented the school at hockey and cricket and gained A, B and D grades at A-level in English, history and ancient history. He then studied English at the University of Birmingham, graduating in 1967.

Tarrant worked as a schoolteacher and also briefly as a film director for the Central Office of Information before joining ATV in 1972 as a newsreader on &quot;ATV Today,&quot; a current affairs programme serving the Midlands area of England, until 1982&quot;.&quot;

It also featured the young Lenny Henry and occasionally Jim Davidson together with Bob Carolgees and his puppet, Spit the Dog. John Gorman, former member of The Scaffold, was also a presenter.

In 1982, along with Bob Carolgees, John Gorman, Randolph Sutherland and Lenny Henry, Tarrant hosted the short-lived Saturday late-night show &quot;O.T.T.&quot; (&quot;Over the Top&quot;), which was billed as an adult version of &quot;Tiswas&quot; but was not such a success. Despite being short-lived, the show was very popular amongst adults. After this, Tarrant did a stint on the breakfast television station TV-am. Sally James presented the concurrent and final series of &quot;Tiswas&quot; alone.

===Capital Radio===

In 1984, Tarrant joined Capital Radio as a presenter, initially presenting the station&#x27;s Sunday lunchtime show before moving to a late-morning weekday slot, following David Jensen. From March 1987 until April 2004 he hosted &quot;Capital Breakfast&quot;. The show was highly popular, increasing Capital Radio&#x27;s audience share in London. Tarrant had regular co-presenter Kara Noble (eventually replaced by Zabe Newsome for a very short duration) as his sidekick for the early years until Noble moved to Heart FM in 1995 with regular contributions from Flying Eye traffic reporter Russ Kane and newsreader Howard Hughes. It was on this show that he first coined his &quot;Is that your final answer?&quot; catchphrase.

At 9:00 am on 2 April 2004, after hosting 4,425 shows, 20 years on Capital Radio and giving away prizes to the value of £3.5 million, Tarrant said his farewell to the station.

===&quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;===

Tarrant began hosting the television quiz show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; in 1998. The format was sold to over 100 other countries. Tarrant coined the format&#x27;s catchphrase, &quot;But we don&#x27;t want to give you that,&quot; and continued his older catchphrase, &quot;Is that your final answer?&quot;, contributing it to the format. Tarrant presented the ITV game show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; from 1998 to 2014, while also providing some audio recordings for some console games, and a tabletop game made by Tiger Electronics based on the show. He recorded a total of 592 episodes across 30 series, in which a total of five contestants won the cash prize of £1 million. 

One contestant, Charles Ingram, won the £1 million cash prize (and was declared by Tarrant as &quot;the most amazing contestant we have ever, ever had&quot;) but was denied his winnings when it was determined that he had cheated. Tarrant attended the trial regarding the Ingram fraud case. When called to testify, he stated that he had not noticed anything amiss during the filming and had not heard any coughing. He said that following the win the Ingrams had been behaving &quot;as normal as people who had just won £1m would be in that situation.&quot; Tarrant also said that he would not have signed the cheque if he had had suspicions of cheating and was &quot;shocked&quot; when he heard about the allegations. 

In subsequent interviews about the Ingram case, Tarrant has always insisted he was totally unaware of any coughing around him at the time of Ingram&#x27;s run, but realised something wasn&#x27;t right after viewing the tape afterwards. He has also said he was very sad about the whole situation, saying: &quot;This was a very cynical plan, motivated by sheer greed. It is hugely insulting to the hundreds and hundreds of other contestants who have come on the show, just hoping for much smaller amounts of money but prepared to try and win their money honestly.&quot;

In July 2000, Tarrant signed a contract with ITV to present the show until December 2002. This contract was later extended to 2013. On 22 October 2013, Tarrant announced that, after fifteen years of hosting the programme, he would be leaving &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, which consequently led ITV to axe the programme once his contract was finished; no more specials would be filmed after this announcement, leaving only those made before it to be aired as the final episodes. After the final celebrity editions, Tarrant hosted a clip show entitled &quot;Chris&#x27; Final Answer&quot;, which aired on 11 February 2014 and ended the original series.

In 2018, ITV commissioned a new series of &quot;Who Wants to be a Millionaire?&quot;, to be presented by new host Jeremy Clarkson. In a television interview, Tarrant said he had chosen not to watch the revived series. He said he would have &quot;politely turned down&quot; an offer by the network to return to the show had he been approached.

In 2020, a TV mini-series, &quot;Quiz&quot;, about Ingram&#x27;s attempt to win a million pounds on &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; by cheating, was released. Tarrant was portrayed by the actor Michael Sheen.

The eight-part series, beginning on 4 October, gave three- to six-year-olds the chance to fulfil their greatest ambitions in the adult world, whether running a photographic studio, a radio station or an ice-cream van. The show was executively produced by Lisa Perrin and Tess Cumming.

Tarrant admitted to the BBC that he did jokingly &quot;lob&quot; some cutlery onto the couple&#x27;s table after asking them to leave him alone to discuss work with his colleagues. He said: &quot;I&#x27;ve no idea what his [the accuser&#x27;s] motives were – it genuinely makes no sense.

<text>Ludwigshafen, officially Ludwigshafen am Rhein (; meaning &quot;Ludwig&#x27;s Port upon the Rhine&quot;), is a city in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate, on the river Rhine (Upper Rhine), opposite Mannheim. With Mannheim, Heidelberg, and the surrounding region, it forms the Rhine Neckar Area.

Known primarily as an industrial city, Ludwigshafen is home to BASF, the world&#x27;s largest chemical producer, and other companies. Among its cultural facilities are the Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz.

It is the birthplace and death place of the former Chancellor of Germany Helmut Kohl.

In 2012, Ludwigshafen was classified as a global city with &#x27;Sufficiency&#x27; status by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC).

==History==

===Early history===
In antiquity, Celtic and Germanic tribes settled in the Rhine Neckar area. During the 1st century B.C. the Romans conquered the region, and a Roman auxiliary fort was constructed near the present suburb of Rheingönheim.

The Middle Ages saw the foundation of some of Ludwigshafen&#x27;s future suburbs, including Oggersheim, Maudach, Oppau, and Mundenheim. Most of the area, however, remained swampland, with its development hindered by seasonal flooding of the Rhine.

===The Rheinschanze===

The Rhine Neckar region was part of the territory of the Prince-elector of the &quot;Kurpfalz&quot;, or Electorate of the Palatinate, one of the larger states within the Holy Roman Empire. The foundation of the new capital of the Kurpfalz, Mannheim, was a decisive influence on the development of the area as a whole. Parallel to the foundation of Mannheim in 1606, a fortress (&quot;die Rheinschanze&quot;) was built by Frederick IV, Elector Palatine on the other side of the Rhine to protect the City of Mannheim, thus forming the nucleus of the City of Ludwigshafen itself.

In the 17th century, the region was devastated and depopulated during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, and also in King Louis XIV of France’s wars of conquest in the later part of the century.

It was only in the 18th century, that the settlements around the Rheinschanze began to prosper, profiting from the proximity of the capital Mannheim. Oggersheim in particular gained some importance, after the construction of both a small palace serving as secondary residence for the Elector, and the famous pilgrimage church, Wallfahrtskirche. For some weeks in 1782, the great German writer and playwright Friedrich Schiller lived in Oggersheim, on flight from his native Württemberg.

War returned to the Ludwigshafen area with the armies of the French Revolution. The palace at Oggersheim was burned down, Mannheim besieged several times, and all the area west of the Rhine annexed by France from 1798 to 1813. The Electorate of the Palatinate was split up. The eastern bank of the Rhine with Mannheim and Heidelberg was given to Baden, while the western bank (including the Ludwigshafen area) was granted to the Kingdom of Bavaria, following the Wars of Liberation (1813–1815), in which the French were expelled. The Rhine had become a frontier and the Rheinschanze, cut off politically from Mannheim, lost its function as the neighbouring city&#x27;s military bulwark.

===Foundation===
In 1808, during the French occupation, Carl Hornig of Mannheim purchased the fortress from the French authorities and turned it into a way station for passing river traffic. Later, the Rheinschanze with its winter-proof harbour basin (created by a flood in 1824) was used as trading post. Hornig died in 1819, but Johann Heinrich Scharpff, a businessman from Speyer, continued Hornig&#x27;s plans, which were then turned over to his son-in-law, Philipp Markus Lichtenberger, in 1830. Their activities marked the beginning of the civilian use of the Rheinschanze.

The year 1844 was the official birth of Ludwigshafen, when Lichtenberger sold this property to the state of Bavaria (Bayern), and the military title of the fortress was finally removed. The Bavarian king, Ludwig I, set forth plans to rename the settlement after himself and to start construction of an urban area as a Bavarian rival to Mannheim on the opposite bank.

During the failed German revolution of 1848 rebels captured Ludwigshafen, but they were bombarded from Mannheim (rumours said the Mannheimers didn&#x27;t aim at the revolutionaries, but on the rival harbour&#x27;s infrastructure), and Prussian troops quickly expelled the revolutionaries. On December 27, 1852, King Maximilian II granted Ludwigshafen am Rhein political freedom and as on November 8, 1859, the settlement gained city status.

===Industry and growth of population===

At its founding Ludwigshafen was still a very modest settlement with just 1,500 inhabitants. Real growth began with industrialization, and gained enormous momentum in Ludwigshafen due to its ideal transport facilities. In addition to its excellent position and harbor facilities on the Rhine, a railway connecting Ludwigshafen with the Saar coalfields was completed in 1849.

The year 1865 was an important date in the history of independent Ludwigshafen. After several discussions, BASF decided to move its factories from Mannheim to the Hemshof district, which belonged to Ludwigshafen. From then on, the city&#x27;s rapid growth and wealth were linked to BASF&#x27;s success and its expansion into becoming one of the world&#x27;s most important chemical companies. Ludwigshafen also became home to several other rapidly growing chemical companies, including Friedrich Raschig GmbH, the Benckiser company (founded by Johann Benckiser), Giulini Brothers, Grünzweig&amp;Hartmann AG, and .

With more jobs available, the population of Ludwigshafen increased rapidly. In 1899 the city was governing more than 62,000 residents (compared to 1,500 in 1852).

This population explosion looked quite “American” to contemporaries; it determined Ludwigshafen&#x27;s character as a “worker&#x27;s city”, and created problematic shortages of housing and real estate. The solution was the expansion of the municipal area and the incorporation of the two nearest villages, Friesenheim and Mundenheim, in the years 1892 and 1899. In the area between the city centre and those two suburbs new quarters (“North” and “South”) were built after (then) modern urban development plans. Because the ground was marshy and too low to be protected from Rhine floods, all the new houses were built on raised ground, sometimes as high as 5 metres above the original ground. Visitors can see the original ground level in many backyards of Ludwigshafen, which are sometimes two floors below street level.

===World War I through World War II===
During World War I (1914–1918), Ludwigshafen&#x27;s industrial plants played a key role in Germany&#x27;s war economy, producing chemical ingredients for munitions, as well as much of the poison gas used on the Western Front. This contributed to Ludwigshafen, on May 27, 1915, being the target of the world&#x27;s first strategic aerial bombardment. French aircraft attacked the BASF plants, killing twelve people and setting the precedent for the age to come.

When the war was lost by Germany in 1918, the left bank of the Rhine was occupied by French troops, in accordance with the terms of the peace agreement. The French occupation lasted until 1930, and some of Ludwigshafen&#x27;s most elegant houses were erected for the officers of the French garrison.

The economic recovery of the 1920s was marred by one of the worst industrial explosions in history when, on Sept. 21, 1921, a BASF storage silo in Oppau blew up, killing more than 500 people, injuring a further 2,000, and destroying countless buildings.

Despite this setback, Ludwigshafen reached a population of 100,000 in 1922, thus gaining &quot;City&quot; status. It prospered until 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression, which brought unemployment, labor trouble, political strife, and the rise of the Nazis.

The Nazi party had few followers and votes in working-class-dominated Ludwigshafen, but succeeded in enforcing their policies. Many small houses with gardens were built, especially in the Gartenstadt. Further, similar to Nazi plans in other cities (e.g. Hamburg), they aimed at creating a &quot;Greater Ludwigshafen&quot; by agglomerating smaller towns and villages in the vicinity. Thus Oggersheim, Oppau, Edigheim, Rheingönheim, and Maudach became suburbs of Ludwigshafen, raising its population to 135,000. The Ludwigshafen synagogue was destroyed in 1938 and its Jewish population of 1,400 was deported in 1940.

During the Oil Campaign of World War II, the Allies conducted bombing of Ludwigshafen and Oppau. Thirteen thousand Allied bombers hit the city in 121 separate raids during the war, of which 56 succeeded in hitting the IG Farben plant. Those 56 raids dropped 53,000 bombs each containing 250 to 4,000 pounds of high explosives, plus 2.5 million 4-pound magnesium incendiary bombs (the bombers also dropped millions of leaflets warning the civilians to evacuate the city, plus counterfeit ration coupons). Repairs took longer and longer as spare parts became more difficult to find. By December 1944, so much damage had been done to vital utilities that output dropped to nearly zero. Follow-up raids every week ended production permanently. By the end of the war most dwellings had been destroyed or damaged; 1,800 people had died, and 3,000 were injured.

The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Ludwigshafen in March 1945. The US 12th Armored Division and 94th Infantry Division captured Ludwigshafen against determined German resistance in house-to-house and block-to-block urban combat during 21–24 March 1945.

===Post-war rebuilding===
Post-war, Ludwigshafen was part of the French occupation zone, becoming part of the newly founded Bundesland (state) of Rheinland-Pfalz and thus part of the Federal Republic of Germany. Reconstruction of the devastated city and revival of the economy was supported by the Allies, especially by American aid. In 1948, the &quot;Pasadena Shares Committee&quot; sent packages of blankets, clothing, food, and medicines to help the residents of post-war Ludwigshafen. Many friendships started to form, so that in 1956, Ludwigshafen am Rhein and Pasadena, California became sister cities.

Large parts of the city were literally ruined, which were rebuilt in the architectural style of the 1950s and 1960s. The most important projects were the Hochstraßen (highways on stilts), the revolutionary new main station (then the most modern station in Europe), several tower blocks and a whole new suburb, the satellite quarter Pfingstweide north of Edigheim.

The city&#x27;s economic wealth allowed social benefits and institutions to be introduced. The population number reached its all-time climax in 1970 with more than 180,000 inhabitants, thus surpassing even the capital of Rheinland-Pfalz, Mainz, for a while.

===Financial crisis===
In the early 1970s, a plan to reform the composition of the German Bundesländer, which would have created a new state around a united Mannheim-Ludwigshafen as capital with more than half a million inhabitants, failed.

Nevertheless, further ambitious projects were financed in Ludwigshafen, first of all the 15-floor city hall with its linked-up shopping centre (Rathaus Center). The last (up to now) new incorporated suburb was Ruchheim in 1974.

But then a process began that accelerated during the 1980s and 1990s and caused the financial near-collapse of Ludwigshafen. The enormous maintenance costs of the buildings and institutions introduced during the &quot;fat time&quot;, new tax regulations that cut down the trade tax profits from the local industries, and thousands of dismissals in BASF were the main causes for the city&#x27;s crisis. Loss of population due to the loss of working places and general economic trends, such as the oil crises, further worsened Ludwigshafen&#x27;s financial situation at the end of the 20th century.

The negative aspects of industrial success became obvious when examinations revealed the bad state of air and the Rhine due to pollution. There had always been some stench or dirt all over the city, caused by BASF and other plants, and as long as the industry had prospered, people had accepted it. Besides that, the concrete constructions that had been so modern after the war and had a formative influence on today&#x27;s cityscape were increasingly considered as obsolete.

===Contemporary Ludwigshafen===
In recent years, many efforts have been made to enhance Ludwigshafen&#x27;s image in the media. The city administration has cut down its deficit by cutting down social payments and maintenance, pollution has been (not least by BASF) restricted, the formerly rotten Hemshof quarter has been restored.

In 2008, a fire broke out in a building where many ethnic Turks lived. 9 people died, all of them Turks and 5 of them children. It was believed to be an arsonist attack, however this was found to be not true.

One of the most annoying faults of Ludwigshafen – at least for many of the city&#x27;s inhabitants - was its comparative lack of high-quality shopping possibilities. It has attempted to repair this deficiency by creating a second large shopping mall on the southern tip of the city centre (the Walzmühle near Berliner Platz) with affiliated railway station (Ludwigshafen-Mitte). In addition, another shopping mall on the banks of the Rhine, the Rhein-Galerie, was completed in September 2010.

Ludwigshafen has enormous importance as an industrial city.

==Districts==

===Centre===

The city centre of Ludwigshafen is comparatively small and dominated by post-war buildings. Its northern and southern boundaries are the Hochstraßen (highways on stilts), the Rhine is in the East and the main station is located in the West of downtown Ludwigshafen, at a walking distance of about 15 minutes from the central pedestrian precinct &quot;Bismarckstraße&quot; that forms, together with the shopping mile &quot;Ludwigsstraße&quot;, the main North-South Axis, connecting the so-called “North Pole” with the &quot;Rathaus Center&quot; and the “South Pole” with Berliner Platz, the Walzmühle shopping centre and Ludwigshafen (Rhein) Mitte station. The main east–west connections are the &quot;Bahnhofsstraße&quot; and &quot;Kaiser-Wilhelm-Straße&quot;. The Pfalzbau, Staatsphilharmonie, Wilhelm-Hack-Museum and the half-destroyed monument Lutherkirche are main features of downtown Ludwigshafen.

===South===

The &quot;Südliche Innenstadt&quot; or “southern city centre” (ca. 29,000 inhabitants) includes the real city centre as described above and the &quot;Stadtteil Süd&quot; or “South” quarter. “South” has some of the most attractive residential areas, especially the &quot;Parkinsel&quot; area. Other sub-quarters of “South” are the &quot;Musikantenviertel&quot; or the &quot;Malerviertel&quot;. In a few years, there will be one more highly prized residential area (“&quot;Rheinufer Süd&quot;”) on the Rhine near the Walzmühle on former industrial estates.

===North===

The &quot;Nördliche Innenstadt&quot; (ca. 22,000 inhabitants) includes the Hemshof, “North” and “West” districts. Hemshof and “North” represent the “old town” of Ludwigshafen, they are known for their very high proportion of foreign inhabitants, making them culturally diverse. ”West” (also called &quot;Valentin-Bauer-Siedlung&quot;) is located between main station and main cemetery.

===Friesenheim===

&quot;Friesenheim&quot; (ca. 18,000 inhabitants) is located north of Hemshof and is one of the two (the other one being Mundenheim) “mother villages” of Ludwigshafen, because they were responsible for the administration of Ludwigshafen prior to its independence. Helmut Kohl was born in Friesenheim. Its western district, the &quot;Froschlache&quot;, boasts four impressive tower blocks.

===Oppau===

&quot;Oppau&quot; (ca. 10,000 inhabitants) in the North is dominated by the nearby BASF and had once been a town of its own prior to its incorporation into Ludwigshafen. In its history, it has been afflicted by several catastrophes like the explosion of 1921 and the flood of 1882.

===Edigheim===

&quot;Edigheim&quot; (ca. 9,000 inhabitants) had once been a part of Oppau in the South, today ist almost as large as Oppau.

The &quot;Pfingstweide&quot; (ca. 6,000 inhabitants) is Ludwigshafen&#x27;s northernmost district; it is dominated by tower blocks and is located in close vicinity to Frankenthal.

===Gartenstadt===

The &quot;Gartenstadt&quot; (ca. 18,000 inhabitants), west of Mundenheim, is (as the name “garden city” suggests) a very green suburb, dominated by flat roofed houses and some tower blocks. Its sub-districts are &quot;Niederfeld&quot;, &quot;Hochfeld&quot; and &quot;Ernst-Reuter-Siedlung&quot;.

===Mundenheim===

&quot;Mundenheim&quot; (ca. 13,000 inhabitants) is a very old suburb, it boasts its own railway station, an extensive industrial area near the harbour. A sub-district is the &quot;Herderviertel&quot; in Mundenheim&#x27;s North.

===Oggersheim===

&quot;Oggersheim&quot; (ca. 23,000 inhabitants) is one of the most important suburbs, being much like a town for itself (which it was in the Middle Ages). It is mentioned in the Wormser wall-building ordinance from around 900 as one of the places that shared responsibility for maintaining the city wall of Worms. During the 18th century, Electress Palatine, Elisabeth Auguste used Schloss Oggersheim as her summer palace.

Helmut Kohl owned a bungalow in southern Oggersheim. The Wallfahrtskirche, a railway station, the important Unfallklinik (“casualty hospital”), and several large residential blocks are to be found in Oggersheim. For the last few years, the northern subdistricts of &quot;Notwende&quot; and &quot;Melm&quot; have seen a large amount of building activities in their new housing estates.

===Rheingönheim===

&quot;Rheingönheim&quot; (ca 7,000 inhabitants), as the southernmost suburb of Ludwigshafen, is known mainly for its industry (Woellner) and its game enclosure Wildpark.

===Maudach===

&quot;Maudach&quot; (ca. 7,000 inhabitants), in Ludwigshafen&#x27;s South-West, is a popular residential area, closely associated with the Maudacher Bruch park.

===Ruchheim===

&quot;Ruchheim&quot; (ca. 6,000 inhabitants), as the westernmost suburb, has long been a small agricultural village, but now it is growing rapidly due to new housing estates.

==Transport==

Although Ludwigshafen has no airfield, it is well connected with several airports in the region. There are small airfields near Speyer, Bad Dürkheim and Worms, a medium-sized regional airport in Mannheim, and the Frankfurt International Airport in about an hour&#x27;s driving distance.

Ludwigshafen is the most important German harbour west of the Rhine. The local industry depends on shipping their raw materials and products on the river. The harbour of Ludwigshafen consists of several basins in the South of the city near Mundenheim (Luitpoldhafen, Kaiserwörthhafen, Mundenheimer Altrheinhafen), the wharfs along the river parallel to the city centre and the BASF, and, finally, of the Landeshafen basin in the North that connects the BASF.

Ludwigshafen has excellent Autobahn (motorway/highway) connections to all directions. Most important are the A 650 in west–east direction, the A 61 in north–south direction. But there are also A 6, A 65 and B 9 to be mentioned. Bundesstraße 37 and 44 pass the city center on elevated expressways. Parts of them are closed because of structural deficiencies. They continue across the Rhine to Mannheim ond Konrad Adenauer Bridge and Kurt Schumacher Bridge.

Ludwigshafen Hauptbahnhof is a huge train station, its impressive pylon bridge pier serving as the city&#x27;s landmark. The extraordinary architecture of the station complex is caused by the need to connect three joining tracks (to Frankenthal/Worms/Mainz, to Neustadt/Speyer and to Mannheim) and to work in the underground Straßenbahn station and the massive road bridge above the concourse. The station has fallen into disuse due to its remote location and bad layout. The new more central Ludwigshafen (Rhein) Mitte station, near Berliner Platz, was opened in 2003 and has become the busiest station in Ludwigshafen. Mannheim Hauptbahnhof, one of the most important stations in Germany, is in easy reach of Ludwigshafen&#x27;s center, just across the Rhine, and serves as Ludwigshafen&#x27;s long-distance station. Other railway stations are at Oggersheim, Mundenheim, and Rheingönheim. The S-Bahn Rhein-Neckar suburban train system started operations in 2003; it serves all these stations.

Ludwigshafen&#x27;s public transport system is run by the VBL (Verkehrsbetriebe Ludwigshafen) and the holding companies Rhein-Neckar-Verkehr (RNV) and VRN. There is an integrated Mannheim/Ludwigshafen tramway network. Lines 4, 4a, 6, 6a, 7, 8, 9, and 10 operate in Ludwigshafen; they all serve Berliner Platz in central Ludwigshafen, adjacent to Ludwigshafen Mitte train station. Except line 10, which runs through Ludwigshafen only, the lines all cross one of the two Rhine bridges between the two cities. Lines 4, 4a, 6, 8, and 9 also serve Mannheim Hauptbahnhof. Furthermore, there is a cross-country tram link to Bad Dürkheim, used by lines 4, 4a, and 9. The bus network consists of about ten municipal lines and further regional lines.

A rather strange feature of Ludwigshafen&#x27;s public transport system is the existence of four underground tram stations (Rathaus, Danziger Platz (closed since late 2008), Hauptbahnhof, Hemshofstraße). They go back to the 1970s, when a common underground network in Mannheim and Ludwigshafen was planned. The rash construction of these first stations in Ludwigshafen became superfluous when Mannheim cancelled the project due to its enormous costs.

==Region and neighbours==

The twin cities of Mannheim and Ludwigshafen closely cooperate in many areas; although they are separated by the Baden-Württemberg/Rhineland Palatinate boundary, this frontier is mainly an administrative one. Many Ludwigshafeners shop and go out in Mannheim&#x27;s inner city, as it is within easy reach. In the reverse case, some Mannheimers work in Ludwigshafen and many University of Mannheim students choose Ludwigshafen as residence because of its cheaper rents.

The surroundings of Ludwigshafen on the left bank of the Rhine are called Pfalz and are the easternmost part of the Palatinate region. The administrative district around Ludwigshafen is called Rhein-Pfalz-Kreis. North of Ludwigshafen, there is the industrial town of Frankenthal. In the western vicinity of Ludwigshafen, there are several villages producing enormous amounts of vegetables, thus securing the Rheinpfalz the title of “Germany&#x27;s vegetable garden”. The district south of Ludwigshafen is dominated by the Rhine and the Altrhein arms (lakes marking the earlier course of the river) and the ancient town of Speyer with its magnificent imperial cathedral, a noteworthy and remarkable city.

The regions with some more distance to Ludwigshafen include the beautiful German Wine Route region with Germany&#x27;s biggest coherent winegrowing area and the Palatinate forest, the biggest coherent forest of Europe in the West, the French region Alsace and the German Schwarzwald (Black Forest) hills in the South, Heidelberg and the Odenwald hills in the East and the Rhein-Main region with the city of Frankfurt about in the North.

==Culture==

The Pfalzbau is a theatre and concert hall with regional importance. The Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz keeps its own symphonic orchestra, and there is a production company that stages operas 25 nights per year. In the Hemshof district, there are smaller theatres playing regional dialect plays.

The Wilhelm-Hack-Museum is the municipal art museum, with collections spanning from ancient to contemporary art. It is known for the emblematic Miró mural covering an entire façade, called the &quot;Miró Wall&quot; (Miró-Wand in German). The mural is a work of art by the Spanish artist Joan Miró, with the collaboration of his long-time colleague, the ceramist, Joan Gardy Artigas, and is made of 7,200 ceramic tiles. It has been subject to degradation due to air pollution since it was installed in 1979.

Several small museums in Ludwigshafen focus on the city&#x27;s history, first of all the Stadtmuseum in the &quot;Rathaus Center&quot;, but also the Schillerhaus Oggersheim, K.O. Braun-Museum in Oppau or the Frankenthaler Kanal Museum in the North.

The Fachhochschule Ludwigshafen (technical college) specialises in economics and has an affiliated Ostasieninstitut (East Asia Institute). There is also the Evangelische Fachhochschule Ludwigshafen, specialising in social sciences.

==Economy==
Although BASF is by far the most important industrial company in Ludwigshafen, there are many other firms. Trade and industry in Ludwigshafen have about 90,000 employees in total, with an annual total turnover of nearly 17 billion euros.

BASF is the world&#x27;s leading chemical company, employing 110,000 people in total and about 35,000 (a few years ago, the employee total was about 55,000) of them in the Ludwigshafen plant, which is also the largest chemical plant in the world. The company&#x27;s main products are fertilizers, dye, coolants and many other chemical substances. Among the other chemical companies with plants in Ludwigshafen rank BK Giulini, Abbvie, Raschig and Benckiser. Other important branches of industry are mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, IT and brewery (Mayerbräu Oggersheim).

==Sports==

Ludwigshafen is one of the German cities that has never had a professional football club. Ludwigshafen has quite a large stadium, the Südweststadion, built from debris from World War II with a capacity of around 40,000. Several international matches and some Bundesliga matches when 1. FC Kaiserslautern or Waldhof Mannheim used it as alternative stadium during the past decades have been held there.

Huddersfield Town left-back Dominik Werling was born in Ludwigshafen.

Formerly the most successful Ludwigshafen football club was FSV Oggersheim, whose team experienced short-term success when gaining promotion to the Regionalliga (3rd Division) at the end of the 2006–07 season. However, the club found itself outclassed, and as the financial situation grew worse after two poor seasons, the club withdrew to 11th tier local level play in 2010–11.

, Arminia Ludwigshafen is the highest-classed football club from the city, competing in the Oberliga Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar (V).

An athletics hall has been constructed near the Stadium a few years ago.

The TSG Friesenheim plays in the German 1st handball division since summer 2010.

==Nature==

There are several municipal parks in Ludwigshafen: First of all the Ebertpark in the North quarter and Friesenheim. It was created for the South German Horticulture Exhibition in 1925 with the Friedrich-Ebert-Halle, a multi-purpose hall.

The official Stadtpark, or municipal park, is somewhat remote from the city centre (yet easy to reach by the #10 tram), because it is situated on the Parkinsel, or park island, on a bank of the Rhine.

The Friedenspark is closer to the city centre, being located just north of the main station and west of the city hall. It is the youngest of Ludwigshafen&#x27;s parks, having been created on a former industrial area.

Further, there are numerous smaller parks that are just a bit larger than a towel in the suburbs, for example the Stadtpark Oggersheim, Riedsaumpark, Alwin-Mittasch-Platz and Friesenpark in Friesenheim, Stadtpark Oppau, Bürgerpark Pfingstweide or Zedtwitzpark Mundenheim.

The Maudacher Bruch in the West between Maudach, Gartenstadt and Oggersheim, is a very extensive, horse-shoe shaped area, including the Michaelsberg (126m), a mountain built of debris and wreckage after World War II. Due to excessive extraction of ground water from chemical companies the ground water level drops and the diversity of nature is no longer preserved. The Kief’scher Weiher in the South is connected with the Rhine and serves as yacht harbour, being surrounded by weekend camping areas.

<text>Night Must Fall is a play, a psychological thriller, by Emlyn Williams, first performed in 1935. There have been three filmed adaptations: &quot;Night Must Fall&quot; (1937); a 1954 adaptation on the television anthology series &quot;Ponds Theater&quot; starring Terry Kilburn, Una O&#x27;Connor, and Evelyn Varden; and &quot;Night Must Fall&quot; (1964).

==Play==
Mrs. Bramson, a bitter, fussy, self-pitying elderly woman, resides in a remote part of Essex, with her intelligent yet subdued niece, Olivia. Mrs Bramson spends all her time complaining while sitting in a wheelchair (although it is revealed during the play that she has in fact no disability whatsoever). She is thoroughly disliked by her two servants, Dora, a young, sensitive maid and Mrs Terrence, the cook, as well as Olivia, whom Mrs. Bramson also treats as a servant.

One day, Dora reveals she is pregnant. Mrs Bramson considers dismissing her, but then decides to persuade the father of Dora&#x27;s unborn child to marry her. The father turns out to be a suave, handsome young man named Dan. He almost immediately charms Mrs Bramson, causing her to forget all about Dora&#x27;s pregnancy and take Dan on as her private assistant.

Olivia, however, isn&#x27;t as taken in by the charming Dan as her aunt is; she feels that he is putting on a facade and lying to hide something sinister. Her suspicions grow when, a few days later, it is reported that a local beauty has gone missing. Believing Dan to be involved, she, the servants, and her pompous admirer, Hubert, go through Dan&#x27;s things when he is not around, finding a picture of him and the missing woman buried among his belongings. This shocking discovery strengthens Olivia&#x27;s suspicions and determination to prove that Dan is not what he seems.

Then one night, a human hand is found in the rubbish outside the house. Later on, a body is discovered in the woods — it is that of the missing woman, only without a head. Olivia now fears that Dan is a murderer. She also believes he keeps the head in a small hat box that he brought with him. Amidst all the chaos, Hubert tries to convince Olivia to come away with him and be his wife, but she refuses.

One night, Mrs Bramson reveals to Olivia that she has hundreds of pounds locked away in a safe in the middle of the living room. Olivia warns her that it is not wise to leave a safe in plain sight, but Mrs Bramson refuses to listen. Later that night, Olivia tries again to confront Dan and he tells her about his past. She tells him why she puts up with her aunt, even saying that she wished she could kill her, to which Dan replies that she probably couldn&#x27;t. The two share a brief moment of understanding.

They are interrupted by Belsize, a police officer from Scotland Yard who has come to briefly question Olivia and Dan in connection with the murder. While interviewing Dan, Belsize discovers the locked hat box. He asks Dan for the key, but Dan says it is not his. As Belsize grows more persistent and suspicious, Olivia comes in and states that the hat box is hers and puts it in her room.

Later that night, the servants get ready to go home. Olivia also says she is leaving to stay with friends in London. She tells Mrs. Bramson she is too frightened to stay in the house and warns her to get out of the house too. Mrs. Bramson again refuses to listen to her niece, thinking she is just being overexcited. As Dora and Mrs. Terrence prepare to leave, Dan decides to accompany them. Mrs. Bramson is left alone and for the first time, the audience sees that she too is terrified. Dan soon returns and gets Mrs. Bramson ready for bed.

When she drifts off to sleep, he gets a pillow and smothers her to death, although this is not explicitly shown. Dan then opens the safe and steals the money. He prepares to burn the house down, only to be interrupted by Olivia, who has come back and discovered her aunt&#x27;s dead body. She tells Dan she has figured him out. Dan confesses. Just then, they see the lights of a police car coming to the house. Olivia says that the police must not get in, showing that she has fallen for Dan.

Belsize and some other officers arrest Dan. Dora and Mrs Terrence are also present. Olivia tries to implicate herself in the crime, but Dan will not let her, confessing that it was all his own work. Before he is dragged away, he looks in the mirror and talks to himself, proving he is in fact insane. Then he grabs Olivia and passionately kisses her.

==Adaptations==
===Film===
A 1937 film adaptation using the same title was written by John Van Druten, starred Robert Montgomery, Rosalind Russell, and Dame May Whitty, and was directed by Richard Thorpe. Dame May Whitty revisited the same role from when the play was performed in London and in New York City.

A 1954 adaptation on the television anthology series &quot;Ponds Theater&quot; starred Terry Kilburn, Una O&#x27;Connor, and Evelyn Varden.

A 1964 film remake was directed by Karel Reisz from a script by Clive Exton, and starred Albert Finney, Susan Hampshire, Sheila Hancock and Mona Washbourne, but was not as successful as the original film.

===Radio===
A radio adaptation of &quot;Night Must Fall&quot; was presented on &quot;Philip Morris Playhouse&quot; 24 October 1941. Starring Burgess Meredith, Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan and Flora Robson, the program has not survived in radio collections.

&quot;Night Must Fall&quot; was adapted for the 24 July 1944 broadcast of &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot;, starring James Cagney, Rosemary DeCamp and May Whitty.

&quot;Night Must Fall&quot; was adapted for the 12 April 1946 broadcast of NBC&#x27;s Mollé Mystery Theatre by Don Agger and starred Ian Martin as Dan, Virginia Field as Olivia, Ethel Browning as Mrs. Bramson, Thelma Jordan as Dora, Anthony Kemble Cooper as Hubert Laurie, and Neil Fitzgerald as Inspector Belsize.

Robert Montgomery produced, hosted and starred in a CBS Radio adaptation of &quot;Night Must Fall&quot; on &quot;Suspense&quot; 27 March 1948. May Whitty, Heather Angel, Richard Ney and Matthew Boulton co-starred.

Dame Sybil Thorndike took the part of Mrs. Bramson in a 1969 production for BBC Radio 4, directed by Betty Davies and featuring the prolific Welsh radio writer William Ingram as Dan. In 1985 BBC Radio 4 broadcast another production of the play, starring Hywel Bennett as Dan. The station re-aired the dramatisation in 1987, the year of Emlyn Williams&#x27;s death.

<text>Angels with Dirty Faces is a 1938 American crime drama film directed by Michael Curtiz for Warner Brothers. It stars James Cagney, Pat O&#x27;Brien, The Dead End Kids, Humphrey Bogart, Ann Sheridan, and George Bancroft. The screenplay was written by John Wexley and Warren Duff based on the story by Rowland Brown. The film chronicles the relationship of the notorious gangster William &quot;Rocky&quot; Sullivan with his childhood friend and now-priest Father Jerry Connolly. After spending three years in prison for armed robbery, Rocky intends to collect $100,000 from his co-conspirator Jim Frazier, a mob lawyer. All the while, Father Connolly tries to prevent a group of youths from falling under Rocky&#x27;s influence.

Brown wrote the scenario in August 1937. After pitching the film to a number of studios, he made a deal with Grand National Pictures, who wanted Cagney to star in the lead role. However, the film never came to fruition, owing to Grand National&#x27;s financial troubles that led to their bankruptcy in 1939. Cagney then returned to Warner the same year, taking Brown&#x27;s script with him. Warner acquired the story and asked a number of directors to take on the project, eventually settling with Curtiz. Principal photography began in June 1938 at Warner&#x27;s Burbank studios, and finished a week behind schedule in August, due mostly to the time it took to shoot Rocky&#x27;s standoff with the police and eventual execution.

&quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; was released on November 28, 1938, to positive reviews. At the 11th Academy Awards, the film was nominated in three categories: Best Actor (Cagney), Best Director (Curtiz), and Best Story (Brown). &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; is considered by some to be one of the best films of all time, and is widely regarded as a defining moment in Cagney&#x27;s career. It was shortlisted by the American Film Institute in 2008, and was voted 67th in a list of the &quot;100 Best Film Noirs of All Time&quot; by &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; in 2015.

In 2024, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==
In 1920, two Irish-American youths, Rocky Sullivan and Jerry Connolly, attempt to rob a railroad car carrying fountain pens. Jerry escapes from the police, while Rocky is caught and sentenced to reform school.

Fifteen years later, an older Rocky is arrested for armed robbery. His lawyer and co-conspirator, Jim Frazier, asks Rocky to take the blame for the robbery and in exchange, Frazier will keep Rocky&#x27;s share of the robbery, $100,000 (equal to $ today) safe until the day Rocky is released. Rocky agrees, and is sentenced to three years in prison.

After serving his sentence, Rocky returns to his old neighborhood and visits Jerry, who is now a Catholic priest. Jerry advises Rocky to get a place &quot;in the old parish&quot;, so Rocky rents a room in a boarding house run by Laury Martin, a girl he bullied as a youth. He then pays a visit to Frazier&#x27;s casino. Frazier claims to have been unaware of Rocky&#x27;s release, but he promises to have the $100,000 ready by the end of the week, and he gives Rocky $500 spending money (equal to $ today).

After leaving Frazier&#x27;s casino, Rocky has his pocket picked by a gang of young toughs: Soapy, Swing, Bim, Pasty, Crab, and Hunky. After Rocky tracks them down to his old childhood hideout and proves to them he is no sucker, the tough kids admit to an admiration of Rocky&#x27;s reputation and criminal lifestyle. After retrieving his wallet and all the money therein, Rocky invites them to dinner. While they are eating, Jerry arrives and asks the gang why they have not been playing basketball.

With Rocky&#x27;s help, he convinces them to play against another team. At the match, the kids are very disorganized and fighting with the other team. Rocky asks Jerry if he can take over as referee. He takes the boys to task and they start to follow the rules. As Jerry and Laury watch on from the sidelines, Laury expresses her concern over the potential negative influence Rocky may be having on the gang, which is echoed by Jerry.

Later, while walking home, Frazier&#x27;s hit squad makes an attempt on Rocky&#x27;s life. Rocky easily spots his tail and outwits the mobsters&#x27;s attempted hit. In retaliation, he kidnaps Frazier, raiding his house at gunpoint and stealing $2,000 and a ledger. Rocky then brazenly approaches Frazier&#x27;s business partner, Mac Keefer and requests $100,000 in trade for Frazier&#x27;s release. With no other option Mac agrees and pays Rocky but as Rocky leaves, he informs on him to the police. Rocky is arrested and sets about mocking the police for their lack of evidence, even goading them to ring his lawyer (Frazier).

Frazier approaches Mac and learns of Rocky&#x27;s arrest. He informs Mac that Rocky is in possession of the ledger. This forces Frazier to tell the police it was all a &quot;misunderstanding&quot;, and Rocky is released. Jerry learns of the kidnapping, and decides to go to the press to expose corruption in New York. Rocky tries unsuccessfully to stop Jerry as he knows the other mobsters won&#x27;t take kindly to what the priest is trying to do.

On the radio, Jerry denounces the corruption, as well as Rocky, Frazier and Keefer. Frazier and Keefer assure Rocky that no harm will come to Jerry, but he later overhears them renege on their earlier promise and also discovers that they plan to kill both Rocky and Jerry. To protect his friend, Rocky kills Frazier and Keefer instead and after escaping the casino, makes his way to an abandoned warehouse where he is forced to kill a police officer. A standoff ensues with other police.

Jerry arrives and informs the police that he can reason with Rocky and get him to surrender peacefully. The police reluctantly agree to let the priest go into the warehouse. Jerry sees a trapped Rocky and implores him to surrender peacefully, telling him the entire building is surrounded, but Rocky takes Jerry hostage. While trying to escape, Rocky is shot in the leg and caught. After standing trial, he is sentenced to death.

In Rocky&#x27;s last few hours before this execution, Jerry visits with his old friend. He sees the negative impact Rocky could have on the Dead End Kids. Rocky informs Jerry that he intends to die proud and &#x27;spitting in their eyes&#x27;. Jerry pleads with Rocky to look at the negative influence he has had on Soapy and the gang. He asks him to act like a coward and beg for mercy on his way to the death house, citing the impact it would have on the gang, potentially ruining the romantic image they have of the gangster lifestyle. Jerry begs Rocky to be braver and save Soapy from going down the same route he has gone himself. Rocky refuses, telling Jerry that his reputation is all that he has left.

Jerry walks with Rocky as he is being led to his execution. He implores his friend one last time but is gruffly rebuffed. As they enter the execution room, Rocky stoically shakes Jerry&#x27;s hand and wishes him well before walking to the electric chair. Then out of nowhere Rocky seems to break down begging and screaming for mercy. Rocky begins whimpering like a coward and this requires the guards to subdue him and forcefully drag him to the chair. Rocky seemingly dies a coward&#x27;s death. Later, Soapy and the gang read in the newspapers of how Rocky &quot;turned yellow&quot; in the face of his execution and they refuse to believe it. Jerry comes in and Soapy asks if it is true that Rocky had died a coward, and Jerry affirms that it is true. The gang no longer knows what to think about Rocky, or the criminal lifestyle and Jerry then asks them to accompany him to go say a prayer for &quot;a boy who couldn&#x27;t run as fast as I could&quot;.

==Production==
===Development===

Rowland Brown wrote the scenario for &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; in August, 1937. He was known in Hollywood for writing and directing a number of crime films in the early 1930s, including &quot;The Doorway to Hell&quot; and &quot;Quick Millions&quot;. He presented the story to Mervyn LeRoy, who was keen to direct a &quot;vehicle&quot; starring the Dead End Kids, a group of young actors from New York. Brown and LeRoy tried unsuccessfully to negotiate a fee for the scenario.

Brown then began pitching the film to other studios, and eventually made a deal with Grand National Pictures, who wanted James Cagney to star in the lead role. By the end of 1935, it became apparent to Cagney and his business manager brother, William, that Warner Brothers were only interested in paying him a &quot;very small percentage of the income dollar derived&quot; from his work. Therefore, Cagney had no choice and walked away until a better arrangement with Warner could be made. After filing a lawsuit to &quot;rectify the inequalities,&quot; Cagney started working for Grand National Pictures, a small studio compared to Warner.

At the time he was offered the role of Rocky Sullivan, Cagney had already made one film for Grand National, &quot;Great Guy&quot;, but fearing he would be typecast in &quot;tough guy&quot; roles, as he had been at Warner, Cagney turned down the role and opted to star in &quot;Something to Sing About&quot;. The film&#x27;s budget grew to an astronomical $900 thousand, and, on its release, did not fare well at the box office. Its underperformance is believed to have been a contributing factor in the 1939 bankruptcy of Grand National.

Following &quot;Something to Sing About&quot;, Cagney returned to Warner after reaching a better deal with them. At his brother&#x27;s insistence, he took Brown&#x27;s story with him and presented it to the studio. Warner acquired the story and then asked a number of directors to take on the project. LeRoy was the first, and although he showed interest, he was unable to commit because he was making films for MGM; Warner then asked Brown, who showed no interest at all; and finally, Michael Curtiz, who accepted their offer.

===Casting===

Although Cagney had been convinced that he would never agree to play the role of a coward being dragged to his execution, he became enthusiastic about portraying Rocky, seeing it as an opportunity to prove that his acting range extended beyond tough guy roles. To play Rocky, Cagney drew on his memories of growing up in the Yorkville section of Manhattan, New York. His main inspiration was a drug-addicted pimp, who stood on a street corner all day hitching his trousers, twitching his neck, and repeating: &quot;Whadda ya hear! Whadda ya say!&quot;.

Those mannerisms came back to haunt Cagney, who later wrote in his autobiography: &quot;I did those gestures maybe six times in the picture. That was over thirty years ago—and the impressionists have been doing me doing him ever since.&quot; Cagney&#x27;s other inspiration was his childhood friend, Peter &quot;Bootah&quot; Hessling, who was convicted of murder and executed by electric chair on July 21, 1927. The night Bootah was executed, Cagney was playing in a Broadway performance, and wept on hearing of his death.

Pat O&#x27;Brien was cast as Father Jerry Connolly, Rocky&#x27;s childhood friend. O&#x27;Brien had been a contract player with Warner Bros. since 1933, and eventually left the studio in 1940 following a dispute over the terms of his renewal contract. He and Cagney first met in 1926 in Asbury Park, New Jersey. O&#x27;Brien was a &quot;lonely, young&quot; actor &quot;playing in a stock company&quot;. He heard the stage play &quot;Women Go on Forever&quot; (by Mary Boland) was coming to Asbury Park and on its way to Broadway. Wanting to meet the star of the show, he went backstage after a performance and met Cagney for the first time. O&#x27;Brien and Cagney became great friends and remained so until the former&#x27;s death in 1983. Cagney died only three years later.

By May 1938, the Dead End Kids had already starred in Samuel Goldwyn&#x27;s &quot;Dead End&quot;; as well as Warner&#x27;s &quot;Crime School&quot; (both with Humphrey Bogart). They had signed a two-year contract with Goldwyn in 1937, but he sold the contract to Warner Bros. the same year because of their behavior on the set of &quot;Dead End&quot;; in one instance, they &quot;jumped&quot; Bogart and &quot;stole his pants&quot; while in another they crashed a truck into a soundstage.&lt;ref name=&quot;HayesWalker56/74&quot;&gt;Hayes and Walker, pp. 56–74.&lt;/ref&gt; Bogart portrays the crooked lawyer Jim Frazier in &quot;Angels With Dirty Faces&quot;. German scholar Winfried Fluck described Bogart&#x27;s character, Jim Frazier, as an &quot;entirely negative&quot; and &quot;thoroughly bad figure,&quot; in &quot;contrast&quot; with Cagney&#x27;s antihero.

===Writing===
Brown&#x27;s story was revised a number of times by John Wexley and Warren Duff. They provided &quot;powerful treatments,&quot; but as with many of the &quot;catch-as-catch-can&quot; pictures of the time, the screenplay was considered insubstantial. Cagney later recalled: &quot;the actors had to patch up [the script] here and there by improvising right on the set&quot;.

===Filming===

Principal photography began in June 1938 at Warner&#x27;s Burbank studios, and finished a week behind schedule in August, due mostly to the time it took to shoot the scenes of Rocky&#x27;s gunfight with police and his execution.

Cagney&#x27;s opening scene with the Dead End Kids took place in the basement of a deserted building. By this time, the Dead End Kids &quot;had been throwing their weight around quite a bit with [other] directors and actors&quot;. As the scene was being shot, Leo Gorcey jokingly ad-libbed &quot;he&#x27;s psychic!, thereby throwing the rhythm of the scene right out the window, souring the whole thing very nicely&quot;. So in the next take, just before he said &quot;come here, suckers,&quot; Cagney &quot;stiff arm[ed Gorcey] right above the nose. His head went back [and hit] the kid behind him, stunning them both momentarily.&quot; Huntz Hall saw Gorcey being hit, and later recalled in 1978: &quot;Leo hated [Cagney] for the rest of his life&quot; after the incident.

While filming Rocky&#x27;s shootout with the police, one scene called for Cagney to be &quot;right at the opening&quot; as machine-gun bullets took out the windows above his head. At this point in his career, Cagney had experience with the unpredictability of using live gunfire and he later recalled that either &quot;common sense or a hunch&quot; made him cautious. He told Curtiz to &quot;[shoot the scene] in process,&quot; and as he got out of the way, &quot;Burke, the professional machine gunner, fired the shots&quot;. One of the bullets deflected hitting &quot;the steel edge of the window,&quot; and going &quot;right through the wall&quot; where Cagney&#x27;s head had been. This experience convinced Cagney that &quot;flirting this way with real bullets was ridiculous&quot;.

Rocky&#x27;s execution was shot at the Sing Sing Correctional Facility. The death house featured in the film was designed by state architect Lewis Pilcher. It went into service in February 1922. For years, viewers have wondered if Rocky really turns yellow as he is being strapped into the electric chair, or if he is faking it in order to keep his promise to Jerry. Cagney later said: &quot;In looking at the film, it is virtually impossible to say which course Rocky took—which is just the way I wanted it. I played [the role] with deliberate ambiguity so that the spectators can [form their own opinions]. It seems to me it works out fine in either case.&quot;

==Release==
===Theatrical===
The film premiered on November 26, 1938, at the Majestic Theater in Reno, Nevada. &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; grossed $1.7 million from the worldwide box office, and is said to have been a financial success. Analysts claim that if it were not for &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; and two other films directed by Curtiz that year (&quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; and &quot;Four Daughters&quot;), Warner Bros. would have lost a considerable amount of money, resulting in negative turnover for the company&#x27;s 1938 fiscal year.

===Home media===
In 1983, &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; was released on VHS and Betamax by CBS/Fox Video. In February 2005, a digitally-remastered version of the film was released on DVD. The release was part of the &quot;James Cagney Collection&quot;, in which a number of special bonus features were made available, including: audio commentary by film historian Dana Polan, an &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces: Whaddya Hear? Whaddya Say?&quot; featurette, a radio production, film trailers, and a short film titled &quot;Warner Night at the Movies&quot; with film critic and historian Leonard Maltin. In December 2021, Warner Archive Collection released a Blu-ray version of film, newly restored in HD using a 4K scan from the original camera negative, accompanied by all the same bonus material from the 2005 DVD release.

===Adaptations in other media===
&quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; has been adapted into two radio plays. The first was the May 22, 1939, broadcast of &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot;, with Cagney and O&#x27;Brien reprising their film roles; the second on the September 19, 1941, broadcast of the &quot;Philip Morris Playhouse&quot;, starring Sylvia Sidney. In 1995, an Indian version of the film was released, called &quot;Ram Jaane&quot;. It starred Shahrukh Khan as Rocky, and carried out the original story from start to finish, albeit Indianized.

==Critical reception==
===Initial reactions===
&quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; was met with critical acclaim upon release. Frank Nugent, of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, attended the world premiere in Nevada, and called the film a &quot;savage melodrama&quot; offering &quot;Cagney at his best&quot;. The New York-based motion picture journal &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; had similar views. In a review dated November 5, 1938, they called the film a &quot;powerful gangster melodrama,&quot; and said it is &quot;one of the most thrilling pictures produced in some time.&quot; The &quot;acting, particularly by James Cagney, is brilliant&quot;.

On the other hand, Hobe Morrison of &quot;Variety&quot; was less enthused stating &quot;On the strength of the Cagney–O&#x27;Brien combo, &quot;Angels&quot; should do fair business, but the picture itself is no bonfire. That &#x27;Dead End&#x27; kid story has already been told too many times.&quot; and &quot;Although the deathhouse scene itself is a harrowing one, that simulated cowardice angle, seems completely implausible...It&#x27;s a novel twist to a commonplace story, but it&#x27;s thoroughly hokey&quot;.

===Accolades===
Cagney won two awards for Best Actor from the National Board of Review and the New York Film Critics Circle. &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; was nominated for three awards at the 11th Academy Awards ceremony: Best Actor (for Cagney), Best Director (for Curtiz), and Best Writing (for Brown).

===Contemporary consensus===
The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports 100% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 21 reviews collected retrospectively, with an average rating of 8.05/10. In 2005, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; praised &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; for being Warner&#x27;s &quot;best gangster movie&quot;. Awarding four out of four stars, Jeremiah Kipp said: &quot;Rocky Sullivan embodies all the qualities we love about bad guys.&quot; Cagney &quot;offers a real intensity and a sense of playfulness,&quot; even as he shoots &quot;fellow gangsters&quot; dead. The final, &quot;climactic&quot; scene of &quot;cowardice is unparalleled in gangster movies, and the more Cagney begs and screams, the more [we are] amazed at how he reduces the hero worship of gangsters to nothing. [The film marks] Cagney&#x27;s finest hour in a career filled with great performances.&quot;

==Legacy==

&quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; is considered by some to be one of the finest films in Cagney&#x27;s career, and a &quot;true example of brilliant American cinema.&quot; In 2008, it was shortlisted by the American Film Institute for selection in its list of the top 100 movies of the last 100 years. In 2013, Steven Van Zandt named it as one of his &quot;most favorite mob movies&quot; in an article for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In 2015, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; named it 67th in a list of the &quot;100 Best Film Noirs of All Time&quot;.

Over the years, the film has inspired a number of parodies. In 1939, Warner Bros. released a cartoon short spoofing their &quot;cycle&quot; of crime films; the cartoon&#x27;s title, &quot;Thugs with Dirty Mugs&quot;, is a direct pun on &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot;. In the early 1990s, parodies appeared in the form of films within a film in &quot;Home Alone&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot;. These parodies are called &quot;Angels with Filthy Souls&quot; and &quot;Angels with Even Filthier Souls&quot;. The former of the two later reappeared in the film &quot;Detective Pikachu&quot;.

In an episode of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, a segment entitled &quot;Monsters with Dirty Faces&quot; features &quot;Officer Grover showing a gang leader named Rocky how to effectively wash his face.&quot; The film&#x27;s plot inspired an episode of &quot;&quot; called &quot;It&#x27;s Never Too Late&quot;. The British sketch comedy TV series &quot;Hale and Pace&quot; parodied the film in a sketch titled &quot;Angels with Big Trousers&quot;, with Norman Pace playing &quot;James Cagney as Rocky Pantaloon&quot; and Gareth Hale playing &quot;Somebody O&#x27;Brien as the Irishman.&quot;

Sham 69, an English punk rock group, had a hit single called &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; in 1978. Frontman Jimmy Pursey was inspired to write the song after watching Cagney in the film one evening with his friend, Chrissie. The Pillows also have a song based on the film titled &quot;I Want to Be Sullivan,&quot; and features a sample taken from the film in the song&#x27;s intro.

A bar in New York City was called &quot;Rocky Sullivan&#x27;s Pub&quot;, named after Cagney&#x27;s character in the film.

<text>Babes in Arms is a 1937 coming-of-age musical comedy with music by Richard Rodgers, lyrics by Lorenz Hart, and book by Rodgers and Hart. It concerns a group of small-town Long Island teenagers who put on a show to avoid being sent to a work farm by the town sheriff. Several songs in &quot;Babes in Arms&quot; became pop standards, including the title song, &quot;Where or When&quot;, &quot;The Lady Is a Tramp&quot;, and &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot;. The film version, released in 1939, starred Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney and was directed by Busby Berkeley. 

== Different versions ==
The original version had strong political overtones with discussions of Nietzsche, the appearance of a Communist character, and two African-American youths who are victims of racism. In 1959 George Oppenheimer created a &quot;sanitized, de-politicized rewrite&quot; for stage performance; it is now the most frequently performed version. In the new version, the young people are trying to save a local summer stock theatre from being demolished, not trying to avoid being sent to a work farm. The sequence of the songs and orchestration are changed drastically, and the dance numbers eliminated.

The 1959 version was the only one available for performance until 1998 when the Cincinnati College Conservatory of Music presented the original version (with a few race references slightly re-edited).

== Production history ==
&quot;Babes in Arms&quot; opened on Broadway at the Shubert Theatre on April 14, 1937, transferred to the Majestic Theatre on October 25, 1937, and closed on December 18, 1937, after 289 performances. The production, under the auspices of Dwight Deere Wiman, was staged by Robert B. Sinclair with choreography by George Balanchine. Settings were by Raymond Sovey, and costumes by Helene Pons. Hans Spialek created the orchestrations and Gene Salzer led the orchestra which included pianists Edgar Fairchild and Adam Carroll. The cast featured Mitzi Green, Ray Heatherton, and Alfred Drake, as well as the Nicholas Brothers.

A studio cast recording starring Gregg Edelman as Val, Judy Blazer as Billie, Jason Graae as Gus, Donna Kane as Dolores, Judy Kaye as Baby Rose, Adam Grupper as Peter, with JQ and the Bandits as the Quartet and featuring the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra was released by New World Records in 1990.

On July 20, 2016, All Star Productions revived the original version at Ye Old Rose and Crown Theatre Pub, London. Theatre critic Darren Luke Mawdsley described the work as &#x27;outmoded,&#x27; stating that he &quot;understand[s] why it has not been staged here [in the UK] in 15 years.&quot;

Porchlight Music Theatre presented &quot;Babes in Arms&quot; in Chicago, Illinois in 2015.

=== Revivals of original 1930s version ===
In addition to the revival of the 1930s original, a New York City Center Encores! staged concert version ran in February 1999. It was directed and choreographed by Kathleen Marshall and featured Erin Dilly, David Campbell, Jessica Stone and Christopher Fitzgerald.

The Cohoes Music Hall presented a reconstructed version of the 1937 production under the supervision of Richard Rodgers in 1976. This production was choreographed by Dennis Grimaldi and directed by David Kitchen and Dennis Grimaldi.

=== Productions of the 1950s version ===
In 1985, Ginger Rogers directed a production at the Music Hall in Tarrytown, New York, that starred Randy Skinner who also choreographed the show and Karen Ziemba as Susie. The song &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Know What Time It Was&quot; was added to the song list.

The musical was produced at the Chichester Festival Theatre from June 7, 2007, through July 7, 2007, and cast Judy Garland&#x27;s daughter Lorna Luft as the domineering mother of former child star Baby Rose Owens. One reviewer complained that the musical seemed to have lost its legendary political bite, evidently unaware that this was the revised 1950s de-politicized version. She was given two new songs from neither the stage version nor the film in which her mother appeared.

===Goodspeed Opera House Production===
In 2002, a production was mounted at Goodspeed Opera using a new book by Joe DiPietro which included plot points from the original 1937 version and also elements from the 1939 MGM film. The original score was utilized along with additional Rodgers and Hart songs. Randy Skinner choreographed the production.

==Plot of original 1937 version==
In Seaport, Long Island in the 1930s, Val and Marshall&#x27;s vaudeville parents leave them behind to go on tour. Val meets Billie, a girl who has driven from the coast, only to have her car break down. The pair sing a love song about their sense of having met before (&quot;Where or When&quot;).

The Sheriff then visits them to inform them that they have to work at the work farm because they are not yet 21. The &quot;kids&quot; decide that they will stick around instead and find another way to support themselves (&quot;Babes in Arms&quot;), forming a group with Val as the leader. After deciding nothing (except that violence is good), they disperse. 

Dolores, the Sheriff&#x27;s daughter, talks to Gus, her ex, who tries to woo her but fails. However, the two then sing and flirt about how they do not care that their relationship is over (&quot;I Wish I Were in Love Again&quot;). Marshall arrives, jealous of Gus still wooing Dolores. When Val enters mentioning that he has also kissed Dolores, a fight begins and escalates when others enter. The sheriff comes in and the kids pretend to be dancing. This causes Val to decide to put on their own follies. The Sheriff decides to give them two weeks to put on the show (&quot;Babes in Arms Reprise&quot;).

Later, Val enters and tells Irving and Ivor to practice their number (&quot;Light on Our Feet&quot;). Lee then arrives and chastises his brother, Beauregard, for hanging out with &quot;the blacks&quot;. Billie then convinces Lee to invest his money in the show. Lee smears some of her lipstick on his cheek and convinces the boys that she kissed him. 

The boys next convince &quot;Baby Rose&quot;, a former child star, to be in their show. Rose performs a number she learned (&quot;Way Out West&quot;).

Billie enters with a jealous Val. After calming him, they discuss the show. Lee does not want Irving and Ivor in the show. After learning this, Val leaves in a huff. Billie reflects on her romance with Val (&quot;My Funny Valentine&quot;). They transition into the day of the show and show the final number of the follies performed by Baby Rose (&quot;Johnny One Note&quot;). Backstage, Lee and Val fight over letting Irving and Ivor go on despite their race. Val punches Lee, and Irving and Ivor go and do the big dance finale (&quot;Johnny One Note Ballet&quot;).

Act 2 opens on the gang sitting despondently trying to cheer each other up because they are at the work farm (&quot;Imagine&quot;). Val comes in and calls them away to lunch, staying behind to inform Billie that his parents will be away for 3-4 more months. They talk and Val mocks Billie&#x27;s beliefs on luck and her immaturity (&quot;All at Once&quot;).

For the gang&#x27;s first night off, the sheriff is throwing a party in a field on Val&#x27;s property. The former communist Peter enters, having won money in a raffle, and proclaims that he is to travel the world and not share his money to which the gang is upset (&quot;Imagine Reprise&quot;). A ballet dream sequence of his travels (&quot;Peter&#x27;s Ballet&quot;) follows. After the ballet he decides to invest the money (&quot;Imagine Reprise 2&quot;).

Later at the party, the Sheriff attempts to make good with the kids. Billie tells Val that she plans on leaving the farm for the road. Val insists on going with her before being called back to the kitchen. Billie sings about how she doesn&#x27;t mind driving around. She also talks about how she likes living on her own terms (&quot;Lady is a Tramp&quot;).

Peter returns to the party informing the crew that he lost all the money. The gang leaves following the news of a trans-Atlantic flight and Delores tells Gus that she will come work on the farm to be with him. He reacts by telling her how she doesn&#x27;t return his affections and drags him along (&quot;You are so Fair&quot;). After pretending to not care about each other, they admit that they like each other.

The gang re-enters and listen to the radio. They realize the Aviator must make a forced landing, and in their field no less! After much scrambling, they call the airport to get reporters to come, and Val decides to impersonate the aviator. The reporters believe his impersonation and the city decides to throw the aviator a party. After concocting a scheme, Billie takes control of the unconscious and tied-up aviator and relishes the fact that the gang treats her as an equal (&quot;Lady is a Tramp Reprise&quot;).

At the party, the gang repeatedly interrupts the mayor&#x27;s introduction of the Aviator to delay the Aviator&#x27;s speech. Performing a variety of musical numbers (&quot;Specialty: You are so fair, Imagine, My Funny Valentine, Light on Our Feet, and Lady is a Tramp&quot;). After The Aviator&#x27;s speech the entire chorus performs a rousing closing number (&quot;Finale Ultimo&quot;).
