<text>George Emlyn Williams, CBE (26 November 1905 – 25 September 1987) was a Welsh writer, dramatist and actor.

==Early life==
Williams was born into a Welsh-speaking, working class family at 1 Jones Terrace, Pen-y-ffordd, Ffynnongroyw, Flintshire. He was the eldest of the three surviving sons of Mary (née Williams) a former maid-servant and Richard Williams, a greengrocer. He spoke only Welsh until the age of eight. Later, he said he would probably have begun working in the mines at age 12 if he had not caught the attention of Sarah Grace Cooke, the model for Miss Moffat in &quot;The Corn Is Green&quot;. She was a teacher of French at the grammar school in Holywell, Flintshire in 1915, where Williams had gone on a scholarship. Over the next seven years she encouraged him in his studies and helped pay for him to stay with a French friend of hers in Haute-Savoie in France, where he spent three months perfecting his French. When he was 17 she helped him win a scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford, where he studied French and Italian.

In 1926, during his studies at university, Williams had a nervous breakdown, which was blamed largely on a failed emotional friendship with another undergraduate. As a means of recovery Miss Cooke encouraged him to write. However, Williams intended to enter the theatrical world too and joined the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS).

==Professional career==
Aged 22, Williams performed with OUDS in his first full-length play, &quot;Full Moon&quot;, at the original Oxford Playhouse in 1927. Later that year he joined a London-based repertory company and began his stage career. By age 25 (1930), he had expanded his writing with works such as &quot;A Murder Has Been Arranged&quot; and &quot;The Late Christopher Bean&quot;. The same year he appeared in Edgar Wallace&#x27;s hit thriller &quot;On the Spot&quot; in the West End.

Over the next few years, Williams took on roles on stage and on film, including the first film celluloid version of the Edgar Wallace mystery, &quot;The Frightened Lady&quot;. At age 30, he became an overnight star, however, with his thriller &quot;Night Must Fall&quot; (1935), in which he also played the lead role of a psychopathic murderer. The play was noted for its exploration of the killer&#x27;s complex psychological state, a step forward for its genre. It was made into a film in 1937 with Robert Montgomery, and again in 1964 with Albert Finney. It has been frequently revived, most recently in the West End with Jason Donovan, and on Broadway in 1999 with Matthew Broderick.

His other highly successful play was very different: &quot;The Corn Is Green&quot;, written in 1938 at age 33), was partly based on his own childhood in Wales. He starred as a Welsh schoolboy in the play&#x27;s London premiere. The play came to Broadway in 1940 with Ethel Barrymore as the schoolteacher Miss Moffat. A 1950 Broadway revival starred Eva La Gallienne. The play was turned into a very successful film starring Bette Davis, and again into a made-for-television film starring Katharine Hepburn, under the direction of Williams&#x27;s close friend George Cukor. An attempt to turn the play into a musical in the 1970s, with Davis again in the role of the schoolteacher with lyrics by Williams, failed. So did a Broadway revival in 1983 starring Cicely Tyson and Peter Gallagher. But a 1985 London revival at the Old Vic with Deborah Kerr was successful, as was a 2007 production at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Massachusetts. That production starred Kate Burton. Williams was a close friend of Kate&#x27;s parents, Richard Burton and Burton&#x27;s first wife, Sybil. In the Williamstown production, the schoolboy – the role created by and modeled on Williams himself – was played by Kate Burton&#x27;s son, Morgan Ritchie. &quot;The Corn is Green&quot; was revived at the National Theatre in London in 2022 with Nicola Walker playing Miss Moffat. Emlyn Williams included this story in his early autobiography &quot;George&quot; covering the years 1905-1927 and published in 1961. A sequel, &quot;Emlyn&quot;, covering the years 1927–1935, was published in 1973.

Emlyn Williams&#x27;s autobiographical light comedy, &quot;The Druid&#x27;s Rest&quot;, was first performed at the St Martin&#x27;s Theatre, London, in 1944. It saw the stage debut of Richard Burton whom Williams had spotted at an audition in Cardiff. The play has been revived at Clwyd Theatr Cymru in both 1976 and 2005, and received its first London revival in sixty years at London&#x27;s Finborough Theatre in 2009.

In addition to stage plays, Emlyn Williams wrote a number of film screenplays, working with Alfred Hitchcock (on &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;), Carol Reed and other directors. He acted in and contributed dialogue to various films based on the novels of A. J. Cronin, including &quot;The Citadel&quot; (1938), &quot;The Stars Look Down&quot; (1939), &quot;Hatter&#x27;s Castle&quot; (1942) and &quot;Web of Evidence&quot; (1959). He played the mad Roman emperor Caligula in an uncompleted 1937 film version of Robert Graves&#x27;s novel &quot;I, Claudius&quot; (with Charles Laughton); a kindly veterinarian who accidentally causes the death of a murderess (played by Bette Davis) in the 1952 suspense drama &quot;Another Man&#x27;s Poison&quot;; and the fool Wamba in the 1952 &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (with Robert Taylor and Elizabeth Taylor).

Other screen credits include Hitchcock&#x27;s adaptation of Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; (with Charles Laughton), Gabriel Pascal&#x27;s film version of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Major Barbara&quot; (with Wendy Hiller and Rex Harrison), José Ferrer&#x27;s &quot;I Accuse!&quot; (playing Émile Zola), &quot;The Wreck of the Mary Deare&quot; (with Gary Cooper), &quot;The L-Shaped Room&quot; (with Leslie Caron), and a made-for-TV adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (with an all-star cast including Laurence Olivier, Michael Redgrave, Ralph Richardson and Edith Evans). In 1941 Williams starred in the film &quot;You Will Remember&quot;, directed by Jack Raymond and written by Sewell Stokes and Lydia Hayward. The film is based on the life of the popular late Victorian songwriter Leslie Stuart, played here by Robert Morley, with Williams as Stuart&#x27;s best friend. Also in 1941, he had a principal supporting part (as Snobby Price) in Gabriel Pascal&#x27;s filming of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Major Barbara&quot;.

Williams&#x27;s only film as a director, &quot;The Last Days of Dolwyn&quot; (1949), which he also wrote and starred in, marked the screen debut of his fellow Welshman, Richard Burton. Williams often appeared in his own plays, and was famous for his one-man shows, with which he toured the world, playing Charles Dickens in an evening of excerpts from Dickens&#x27;s novels. This &quot;one man show&quot; was the start of a whole new theatrical genre. He followed up his Dickens performance with one man shows based on the works of Dylan Thomas, &quot;Dylan Thomas Growing Up&quot;, and H. H. Munro better known under his pseudonym Saki. His post-war acting credits included &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot; by Terence Rattigan and &quot;The Deputy&quot; aka &quot;The Representative&quot; by Rolf Hochhuth on Broadway. He also was the &quot;voice&quot; of Lloyd George in the seminal BBC documentary &quot;The Great War&quot; (1964).

Among Williams&#x27;s other books was the best seller &quot;Beyond Belief: A Chronicle of Murder and its Detection&quot; (1968), a semi-fictionalised account of the Moors murderers, Ian Brady and Myra Hindley. His 1980 novel &quot;Headlong&quot;, the fictional story of the unexpected death of the entire British royal family in a freak accident in 1930, and the ascent of a most unlikely heir to the British throne as a result, was the loose basis of the 1991 motion picture &quot;King Ralph&quot;.

On Monday 17 February 1975, Williams was Roy Plomley&#x27;s guest on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; on BBC Radio 4. The author&#x27;s book choice was a dictionary with a typewriter, pen and paper combined as his luxury.

==Personal life==
Williams was married in 1935 to actress Mary Marjorie O&#x27;Shann (Molly Shan), who died in 1970. They had two sons, Alan, a writer, and Brook, an actor. Brook became a close friend of Richard Burton, working as his personal assistant and appearing in many of his films. Williams is godfather to Kate Burton.

Both during his marriage and following his wife&#x27;s death, Williams was actively bisexual throughout his adult life. He maintained a relationship from 1981 to 1986 with American theatre journalist Albert N. Williams whom Emlyn met while appearing at the Northlight Theatre in the Chicago area with his one-man Charles Dickens show. (Albert Williams served as Emlyn Williams&#x27;s personal assistant during a 1982 tour of England, Wales and Ireland with the Charles Dickens and Dylan Thomas solo shows.)

<doc id="147239" wikidata="Q336556" url="?curid=147239" title="George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys">
<text>George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys (15 May 1645 – 18 April 1689), also known as &quot;the Hanging Judge&quot;, was a Welsh judge. He became notable during the reign of King James II, rising to the position of Lord Chancellor (and serving as Lord High Steward in certain instances). His conduct as a judge was to enforce royal policy, resulting in a historical reputation for severity and bias.

== Early years and education ==
Jeffreys was born at the family estate of Acton Hall, in Wrexham, in Wales, the sixth son of John and Margaret Jeffreys. His grandfather, John Jeffreys (died 1622), had been Chief Justice of the Anglesey circuit of the Great Sessions. His father, also John Jeffreys (1608–1691), was a Royalist during the English Civil War, but was reconciled to the Commonwealth and served as High Sheriff of Denbighshire in 1655.

His brothers were people of note. Thomas, later Sir Thomas (knighted in 1686), was the English Consul in Spain and a Knight of Alcántara. William was vicar of Holt, near Wrexham, from 1668 to 1675. His younger brother, James, made a good ecclesiastical career, becoming Vice-Dean of Canterbury in 1685.

George was educated at Shrewsbury School from 1652 to 1659, his grandfather&#x27;s old school, where he was periodically tested by Philip Henry, a friend of his mother. He attended St Paul&#x27;s School, London, from 1659 to 1661 and Westminster School, London, from 1661 to 1662. He became an undergraduate at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1662, leaving after one year without graduating, and entering the Inner Temple for law in 1663.

== Early career ==
He embarked on a legal career in 1668, becoming a Common Serjeant of London in 1671. He was aiming for the post of Recorder of London, but was passed over for this in 1676 in favour of William Dolben. He turned instead to the Court and became Solicitor General to the Duke of York and of Albany (later King James II &amp; VII), the younger brother of Charles II. Despite his Protestant upbringing, he found favour under the Roman Catholic Duke.

Jeffreys distinguished himself with black humour, for example noting that two brothers convicted of stealing lead from the roof of Stepney Church had &quot;zeal for religion ... so great as to carry you to the top of the church&quot;, and noting that they had narrowly avoided committing a capital offence.

==Recorder of London==

Jeffreys was knighted in 1677, became Recorder of London in 1678 when Dolben resigned, and by 1680 had become Chief Justice of Chester and Counsel for the Crown at Ludlow and Justice of the Peace for Flintshire. During the Popish Plot he was frequently on the bench which condemned numerous innocent men on the perjured evidence of Titus Oates. These condemnations were remembered against him in 1685 when he secured the conviction of Oates for his perjury at the same trials. Charles II created him a baronet in 1681, and two years later, he was Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench and a member of the Privy Council.

==Lord Chief Justice==

Jeffreys became Lord Chief Justice in 1683 and presided over the trial of Algernon Sidney, who had been implicated in the Rye House Plot. Sidney was convicted and executed: Jeffreys&#x27;s conduct of the trial caused some unease, in particular, his ruling that while two witnesses were normally required in a treason trial, and the Crown had only one, Sidney&#x27;s own writings on republicanism were a second &quot;witness&quot; on the ground that &quot;to write is to act&quot;. John Evelyn, meeting him at a wedding two days later, thought his riotous behaviour unbecoming to his office, especially so soon after Sidney&#x27;s trial. Jeffreys&#x27;s elevation was seen by many as a reward for the successful conviction of Lord Russell in connection with the same conspiracy as Sidney: Jeffreys, who had led for the prosecution at Russell&#x27;s trial, replaced Sir Francis Pemberton, who had presided at the same trial and made clear his doubts about Russell&#x27;s guilt, much to the King&#x27;s displeasure. Jeffreys conducted the prosecution with far more dignity and restraint than was usual with him, stressing to the jury that they must not convict unless they were certain of Russell&#x27;s guilt.

A less well-known act of Jeffreys occurred on assize in Bristol in 1685 when he made the mayor of the city, then sitting fully robed beside him on the bench, go into the dock, and fined him £1000 for being a &#x27;kidnapping knave&#x27;. Some Bristol traders were known at the time to kidnap their own countrymen and ship them away as slaves.

==Lord Chancellor==

James II, following his accession to the throne, named Jeffreys as Lord Chancellor in 1685, and elevated him to the peerage as Baron Jeffreys of Wem. In 1687 he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire and of Buckinghamshire. His first major trial in James&#x27; reign was that of Titus Oates. While there is no doubt of Oates&#x27; guilt, Jeffreys&#x27;s conduct was no more decorous than usual; the latter part of the trial has been described as such an exchange of insults between Jeffreys and Oates as to make it doubtful if proceedings could continue. Unable to impose the death penalty, Jeffreys and his colleagues apparently tried to achieve the same result by sentencing Oates to a series of whippings so savage that he might well have died; although, as Kenyon remarks, it was arguably no more than he deserved. Jeffreys was much criticised for his conduct of the trial of the aged and much-respected clergyman Richard Baxter, but these criticisms must be treated with caution since the actual records have disappeared and all the surviving accounts of the trial were written by partisans of Baxter.

==The Bloody Assizes==

Jeffreys&#x27;s historical notoriety comes from his actions in 1685, after Monmouth&#x27;s Rebellion. Jeffreys was sent to the West Country in the autumn of 1685 to conduct the trials of captured rebels. The centre of the trials was Taunton, Somerset. Estimates of the numbers executed for treason have been given as high as 700; however, a more likely figure is between 160 and 170 of 1,381 defendants found guilty of treason. Although Jeffreys has been traditionally accused of vindictiveness and harsh sentencing, none of the convictions has been considered improper, except for that of Alice Lisle tried at Winchester. Furthermore, as the law of the time required a sentence of death for treason, Jeffreys was required to impose it, leaving the king the option of commuting the sentence under the prerogative of mercy. Arguably, it was James II&#x27;s refusal to use the prerogative as much as was customary for the time rather than Jeffreys&#x27;s actions that made the government&#x27;s reprisals so savage.

Alice Lisle was accused of sheltering some members of the defeated rebel army who had not yet been found guilty of treason. There was no evidence that she had taken an active part in the rebellion itself, and she was not accused of this. When the jury asked whether her actions could in law be considered treasonable, Jeffreys replied affirmatively. The jury then returned a guilty verdict. She was executed at Winchester by beheading (although the original sentence had been that she was to be burned at the stake). The King&#x27;s refusal to reprieve her gave rise to a belief that he was taking posthumous revenge on her husband, the regicide Sir John Lisle, who had been one of his own father&#x27;s judges at his trial in 1649. Lisle had been murdered by Royalist agents at Lausanne in 1664, but the King had a long memory and may well have felt that Alice should suffer judicial punishment in her husband&#x27;s place.

James considered making Jeffreys Viscount Wrexham and Earl of Flint. James refrained only because Jeffreys remained a Protestant. Despite his loyalty to the king, Jeffreys never hid his contempt for Roman Catholicism: in the last months of James&#x27; reign, as the Government drifted without leadership, Jeffreys remarked cynically that &quot;the Virgin Mary is to do all&quot;.

==President of the Ecclesiastical Commission==
As Lord Chancellor, Jeffreys was given the presidency of the Ecclesiastical Commission, a body established by James II under the royal prerogative to control the governance of the Church of England and coerce it. Despite his misgivings and concerns that James was being overly influenced by hardline Roman Catholics, the Ecclesiastical Commission took proceedings against various clergy including the Bishop of London and academics of Oxford and Cambridge universities considered by James II to be overly Protestant. The Ecclesiastical Commission&#x27;s activities came to an end with the Glorious Revolution.

== Residences ==

Jeffreys, presumably after being granted the title 1st Baron of Wem, took the residence of Lowe Hall in Wem, Shropshire. The extant Wem Hall was built in 1666, although it has subsequently been significantly remodelled. He also had Bulstrode Park built for him in 1686.

== Marriages ==

In 1667, he married Sarah Neesham or Needham, by whom he had seven children; she died in 1678. She was the daughter of the impoverished vicar of Stoke d&#x27;Abernon, Thomas Neesham. A story is published, that Jeffreys sought to marry a daughter of a rich City merchant and had a secret correspondence with her, through Sarah, her kinswoman and companion. When the merchant discovered the plot he refused his home to Sarah and George did a noble act by marrying her. They married in the church of All Hallows-by-the-Tower in the City of London.

He married secondly, in 1679, Anne, daughter of Sir Thomas Bloodworth, who was Lord Mayor of London, 1665–66; she was the widow of Sir John Jones of Fonmon Castle, Glamorgan. Being only 29 at the time of her second marriage, she was described as a &#x27;brisk young widow&#x27; and there were some rumours about her. She was said to have a formidable temper: Jeffreys&#x27;s family went in awe of her, and it was said she was the only person he was afraid of. A popular ballad joked that while St. George had killed a dragon and thus saved a maiden in distress, Sir George had missed the maiden and married the dragon by mistake.

== Fall, death and burial==
During the Glorious Revolution, when James II fled the country, Jeffreys stayed in London until the last moment, being the only high legal authority in James&#x27;s abandoned kingdom to perform political duties. When William III&#x27;s troops approached London, Jeffreys tried to flee and follow the King abroad. He was captured in a public house in Wapping, now named The Town of Ramsgate. Reputedly he was disguised as a sailor, and was recognised by a surviving judicial victim, who claimed he could never forget Jeffreys&#x27;s countenance, although his ferocious eyebrows had been shaven. Jeffreys was terrified of the public when dragged to the Lord Mayor and then to prison &quot;for his own safety&quot;. He begged his captors for protection from the mob, who intended &quot;to show him that same mercy he had ever shown to others&quot;.
He died of kidney disease (probably pyelonephritis) while in custody in the Tower of London on 18 April 1689. He was originally buried in the Chapel Royal of Saint Peter ad Vincula in the Tower. In 1692 his body was moved to St Mary Aldermanbury.

In his &quot;London Journal,&quot; Leigh Hunt gives the following account of Judge Jeffreys&#x27;s death and burial: Jeffreys was taken on the twelfth of September, 1688 [&quot;sic&quot;]. He was first interred privately in the Tower; but three years afterwards, when his memory was something blown over, his friends obtained permission, by a warrant of the queen&#x27;s dated September 1692, to take his remains under their own care, and he was accordingly reinterred in a vault under the communion table of St Mary, Aldermanbury, 2nd Nov. 1694. In 1810, during certain repairs, the coffin was uncovered for a time, and the public had sight of the box containing the mortal remains of the feared and hated magistrate.

During the Blitz, St Mary Aldermanbury was gutted by a German air raid and Jeffreys&#x27;s tomb was destroyed. No traces of it remain today. The ruins of the church were transported to the United States in 1966 and rebuilt to its original form in Fulton, Missouri, as a memorial to Winston Churchill. The site is now a landscaped garden.

==Descendants==
Jeffreys&#x27;s only son by Sarah Neesham, John (or Jacky as he was called at home) succeeded to his father&#x27;s peerage. He married Charlotte, a daughter of Philip Herbert, 7th Earl of Pembroke, and Henrietta de Kérouaille, sister of the Duchess of Portsmouth, a mistress of Charles II and a supporter of Jeffreys in the early stages of his career. John and Charlotte Jeffreys had one daughter, named Henriette-Louise after the two Kérouaille sisters, but no son, so that the male line of George Jeffreys became extinct. There are descendants through his daughter and granddaughters. John Jeffreys retained his father&#x27;s loyalty to the Stuart cause. In 1701 he was one of five peers of the realm who voted against the Act of Settlement in the House of Lords, and felt strongly enough to enter written protests in the House of Lords Journal. All five, including Jeffreys, were Jacobite sympathisers who felt that it was wrong to exclude the Stuarts from the throne.

== Reputation ==

Jeffreys&#x27;s reputation today is mixed. Some say he was a personally vengeful man. He had bitter personal and professional rivalries with Sir William Williams. His political animus was displayed during his legal career. He suffered from a painful kidney disease that may well have affected his unbridled temper and added to this reputation, and his doctors apparently recommended alcohol to dull the pain, which may have explained his often shocking conduct in court.

In &quot;The Revolution of 1688&quot;, the historian J. R. Jones refers to Jeffreys as &quot;an alcoholic&quot;.

G. W. Keeton in &quot;Lord Chancellor Jeffreys and the Stuart Cause&quot; (1965) claimed the historical Jeffreys &quot;to be a different person from the Jeffreys of legend&quot;.

After reviewing the Lisle case and contemporary opinion Brian Harris QC concludes that &#x27;Given that [Jeffreys] had to administer a largely inchoate criminal procedure and impose the bloody sentences that the law then required, a balanced judgement would regard Jeffreys as no worse, perhaps even a little better than most other judges of his era.&#x27;

==Legacy==
One session of the Bloody Assizes was held in Dorchester on 5 September, in the Oak Room (now a tea room) of the Antelope Hotel. Jeffreys lodged nearby at 6 High West Street, and is said to have used a secret passage from his lodgings to the Oak Room. In 2014 the passage was discovered and was found to be wide enough for three judges to walk through side by side.

After his fall from power, a portrait of Jeffreys was taken from Gray&#x27;s Inn and left in the cellar of Acton Hall (the family home). When Acton Hall was demolished in the 1950s, that painting and one of his brother Thomas were acquired by Simon Yorke, Squire of Erddig and hung in the entrance hall of Erddig Hall. They can still be seen there. Both portraits are reproduced in Keeton&#x27;s &quot;Lord Chancellor Jeffreys and the Stuart Cause&quot;.

==Portrayals==
Jeffreys was portrayed by Leonard Mudie in &quot;Captain Blood&quot; (1935), Patrick Aherne in &quot;Lorna Doone&quot; (1951), Michael Kitchen in &quot;Lorna Doone&quot; (2001), Christopher Lee in &quot;The Bloody Judge&quot; (1969) and by Elliot Levey in &quot;Martin&#x27;s Close&quot; (2019).

<doc id="147242" wikidata="Q193423" url="?curid=147242" title="Octane rating">
<text>An octane rating, or octane number, is a standard measure of a fuel&#x27;s ability to withstand compression in an internal combustion engine without causing engine knocking. The higher the octane number, the more compression the fuel can withstand before detonating. Octane rating does not relate directly to the power output or the energy content of the fuel per unit mass or volume, but simply indicates the resistance to detonating under pressure without a spark.

Whether a higher octane fuel improves or impairs an engine&#x27;s performance depends on the design of the engine. In broad terms, fuels with a higher octane rating are used in higher-compression gasoline engines, which may yield higher power for these engines. The added power in such cases comes from the way the engine is designed to compress the air/fuel mixture, and not directly from the rating of the gasoline.

In contrast, fuels with lower octane (but higher cetane numbers) are ideal for diesel engines because diesel engines (also called compression-ignition engines) do not compress the fuel, but rather compress only air, and then inject fuel into the air that was heated by compression. Gasoline engines rely on ignition of compressed air and fuel mixture, which is ignited only near the end of the compression stroke by electric spark plugs. Therefore, being able to compress the air/fuel mixture without causing detonation is important mainly for gasoline engines. Using gasoline with lower octane than an engine is built for may cause engine knocking and/or pre-ignition.

The octane rating of aviation gasoline was extremely important in determining aero engine performance in the aircraft of World War II. The octane rating affected not only the performance of the gasoline, but also its versatility; the higher octane fuel allowed a wider range of lean to rich operating conditions.

==Principles==
===The problem: detonation===

In spark ignition internal combustion engines, knocking (also knock, detonation, spark knock, pinging, or pinking) occurs when combustion of some of the air/fuel mixture in the cylinder does not result from propagation of the flame front ignited by the spark plug, but when one or more pockets of air/fuel mixture explode outside the envelope of the normal combustion front. The fuel-air charge is meant to be ignited by the spark plug only, and at a precise point in the piston&#x27;s stroke. Knock occurs when the peak of the combustion process no longer occurs at the optimum moment for the four-stroke cycle. In a simple explanation, the forward moving wave of combustion that burns the hydrocarbon + oxygen mixture inside the cylinder like a wave that a surfer would wish to surf upon is violently disrupted by a secondary wave that has started elsewhere. The shock wave of these two separate waves creates the characteristic metallic &quot;pinging&quot; sound, and cylinder pressure increases dramatically. Effects of engine knocking range from inconsequential (incremental heating plus power loss) to completely destructive (detonation while one of the valves is still open).

Knocking should not be confused with pre-ignitionthey are two separate events with pre-ignition occurring before the combustion event. However, pre-ignition is highly correlated with knock because knock will cause rapid heat increase within the cylinder eventually leading to destructive pre-detonation. 

Most engine management systems commonly found in automobiles today, typically electronic fuel injection (EFI), have a knock sensor that monitors if knock is being produced by the fuel being used. In modern computer-controlled engines, the ignition timing will be automatically altered by the engine management system to reduce the knock to an acceptable level.

===Iso-octane as a reference standard===
Octanes are a family of hydrocarbons that are typical components of gasoline. They are colorless liquids that boil around 125 °C (260 °F). One member of the octane family, 2,2,4-Trimethylpentane (iso-octane), is used as a reference standard to benchmark the tendency of gasoline or LPG fuels to resist self-ignition.

The octane rating of gasoline is measured in a test engine and is defined by comparison with the mixture of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (iso-octane) and normal heptane that would have the same anti-knocking capability as the fuel under test. The percentage, by volume, of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane in that mixture is the octane number of the fuel. For example, gasoline with the same knocking characteristics as a mixture of 90% iso-octane and 10% heptane would have an octane rating of 90. A rating of 90 does not mean that the gasoline contains just iso-octane and heptane in these proportions, but that it has the same detonation resistance properties (generally, gasoline sold for common use never consists solely of iso-octane and heptane; it is a mixture of many hydrocarbons and often other additives).

Octane ratings are not indicators of the energy content of fuels. (See Effects below and Heat of combustion). They are only a measure of the fuel&#x27;s tendency to burn in a controlled manner, rather than exploding in an uncontrolled manner.

Where the octane number is raised by blending in ethanol, energy content per volume is reduced. Ethanol energy density can be compared with gasoline in heat-of-combustion tables.

It is possible for a fuel to have a Research Octane Number (RON) more than 100, because iso-octane is not the most knock-resistant substance available today. Racing fuels, avgas, LPG and alcohol fuels such as methanol may have octane ratings of 110 or significantly higher. Typical &quot;octane booster&quot; gasoline additives include MTBE, ETBE, iso-octane and toluene. Lead in the form of tetraethyllead was once a common additive, but concerns about its toxicity have led to its use for fuels for road vehicles being progressively phased out worldwide beginning in the 1970s.

==Measurement methods==
===Research Octane Number (RON)===
The most common type of octane rating worldwide is the Research Octane Number (RON). RON is determined by running the fuel in a test engine at 600 rpm with a variable compression ratio under controlled conditions, and comparing the results with those for mixtures of iso-octane and n-heptane. The compression ratio is varied during the test to challenge the fuel&#x27;s antiknocking tendency, as an increase in the compression ratio will increase the chances of knocking.

===Motor Octane Number (MON)===
Another type of octane rating, called Motor Octane Number (MON), is determined at 900 rpm engine speed instead of the 600 rpm for RON. MON testing uses a similar test engine to that used in RON testing, but with a preheated fuel mixture, higher engine speed, and variable ignition timing to further stress the fuel&#x27;s knock resistance. Depending on the composition of the fuel, the MON of a modern pump gasoline will be about 8 to 12 lower than the RON, but there is no direct link between RON and MON. See the table below.

===Anti-Knock Index (AKI) or (R+M)/2===
In Canada, The United States, and Mexico, the advertised octane rating is the average of the RON and the MON, called the Anti-Knock Index (AKI). It is often written on pumps as (R+M)/2. AKI is also sometimes called PON (Pump Octane Number).

===Difference between RON, MON, and AKI===
Because of the 8 to 12 octane number difference between RON and MON noted above, the AKI shown in Canada and the United States is 4 to 6 octane numbers lower than elsewhere in the world for the same fuel. This difference between RON and MON is known as the fuel&#x27;s sensitivity, and is not typically published for those countries that use the Anti-Knock Index labelling system.

See the table in the following section for a comparison.

===Observed Road Octane Number (RdON)===
Another type of octane rating, called Observed Road Octane Number (RdON), is derived from testing the gasoline in ordinary multi-cylinder engines (rather than in a purpose-built test engine), normally at wide open throttle. This type of test was developed in the 1920s and is still reliable today. The original RdON tests were done in cars on the road, but as technology developed the testing was moved to chassis dynamometers with environmental controls to improve consistency.

===Octane Index===
The evaluation of the octane number by either of the two laboratory methods requires a special engine built to match the tests&#x27; rigid standards, and the procedure can be both expensive and time-consuming. The standard engine required for the test may not always be available, especially in out-of-the-way places or in small or mobile laboratories. These and other considerations led to the search for a rapid method for the evaluation of the anti-knock quality of gasoline. Such substitute methods include FTIR, near infrared on-line analyzers, and others. Deriving an equation that can be used to calculate ratings accurately enough would also serve the same purpose, with added advantages. The term Octane Index is often used to refer to the use of an equation to determine a theoretical rating, in contradistinction to the direct measurements required for research or motor octane numbers. An octane index can be of great service in the blending of gasoline. Motor gasoline, as marketed, is usually a blend of several types of refinery grades that are derived from different processes such as straight-run gasoline, reformate, cracked gasoline etc. These different grades are blended in amounts that will meet final product specifications. Most refiners produce and market more than one grade of motor gasoline, differing principally in their anti-knock quality. Being able to make sufficiently accurate estimates of the octane rating that will result from blending different refinery products is essential, something for which the calculated octane index is specially suited.

===Aviation gasoline octane ratings===
Aviation gasolines used in piston aircraft engines common in general aviation have a slightly different method of measuring the octane of the fuel. Similar to an AKI, it has two different ratings, although it is usually referred to only by the lower of the two. One is referred to as the &quot;aviation lean&quot; rating, which for ratings up to 100 is the same as the MON of the fuel. The second is the &quot;aviation rich&quot; rating and corresponds to the octane rating of a test engine under forced induction operation common in high-performance and military piston aircraft. This utilizes a supercharger, and uses a significantly richer fuel/air ratio for improved detonation resistance.

The most common currently used fuel, 100LL, has an aviation lean rating of 100 octane, and an aviation rich rating of 130.

==Examples==
The RON/MON values of n-heptane and iso-octane are exactly 0 and 100, respectively, by the definition of octane rating. The following table lists octane ratings for various other fuels.

==Effects==

Higher octane ratings correlate to higher activation energies: the amount of applied energy required to initiate combustion. Since higher octane fuels have higher activation energy requirements, it is less likely that a given compression will cause uncontrolled ignition, otherwise known as autoignition, self-ignition, pre-ignition, detonation, or knocking. 

Because octane is a measured and/or calculated rating of the fuel&#x27;s ability to resist autoignition, the higher the octane of the fuel, the harder that fuel is to ignite and the more heat is required to ignite it. The result is that a hotter ignition spark is required for ignition. Creating a hotter spark requires more energy from the ignition system, which in turn increases the parasitic electrical load on the engine. The spark also must begin earlier in order to generate sufficient heat at the proper time for precise ignition. As octane, ignition spark energy, and the need for precise timing increase, the engine becomes more difficult to &quot;tune&quot; and keep &quot;in tune&quot;. The resulting sub-optimal spark energy and timing can cause major engine problems, from a simple &quot;miss&quot; to uncontrolled detonation and catastrophic engine failure.

Mechanically within the cylinder, stability can be visualized as having a flame wave initiate at the spark plug and then &quot;travel in a fairly uniform manner across the combustion chamber&quot; with the expanding gas mix pushing the piston throughout the entirety of the power stroke. A stable gasoline and air mix will combust when the flame wave reaches the molecules, adding heat at the interface. Knock occurs when a secondary flame wave forms from instability and then travels against the path of the primary flame wave, thus depriving the power stroke of its uniformity and causing issues including power loss and heat buildup.

The other rarely-discussed reality with high-octane fuels associated with &quot;high performance&quot; is that as octane increases, the specific gravity and energy content of the fuel per unit of weight are reduced. The net result is that to make a given amount of power, more high-octane fuel must be burned in the engine. Lighter and &quot;thinner&quot; fuel also has a lower specific heat, so the practice of running an engine &quot;rich&quot; to use excess fuel to aid in cooling requires richer and richer mixtures as octane increases.

Higher-octane, lower-energy-dense &quot;thinner&quot; fuels often contain alcohol compounds incompatible with the stock fuel system components, which also makes them hygroscopic. They also evaporate away much more easily than heavier, lower-octane fuel which leads to more accumulated contaminants in the fuel system. It is typically the and the compounds in the fuel that have the most detrimental effects on the engine fuel system components, as such acids corrode many metals used in gasoline fuel systems.

During the compression stroke of an internal combustion engine, the temperature of the air-fuel mix rises as it is compressed, in accordance with the ideal gas law. Higher compression ratios necessarily add parasitic load to the engine, and are only necessary if the engine is being specifically designed to run on high-octane fuel. Aircraft engines run at relatively low speeds and are &quot;undersquare&quot;. They run best on lower-octane, slower-burning fuels that require less heat and a lower compression ratio for optimum vaporization and uniform fuel-air mixing, with the ignition spark coming as late as possible in order to extend the production of cylinder pressure and torque as far down the power stroke as possible. The main reason for using high-octane fuel in air-cooled engines is that it is more easily vaporized in a cold carburetor and engine and absorbs less intake air heat which greatly reduces the tendency for carburetor icing to occur.

With their reduced densities and weight per volume of fuel, the other obvious benefit is that an aircraft with any given volume of fuel in the tanks is automatically lighter. And since many airplanes are flown only occasionally and may sit unused for weeks or months, the lighter fuels tend to evaporate away and leave behind fewer deposits such as &quot;varnish&quot; (gasoline components, particularly alkenes and oxygenates slowly polymerize into solids). Aircraft also typically have dual &quot;redundant&quot; ignition systems which are nearly impossible to tune and time to produce identical ignition timing, so using a lighter fuel that&#x27;s less prone to autoignition is a wise &quot;insurance policy&quot;. For the same reasons, those lighter fuels which are better solvents are much less likely to cause any &quot;varnish&quot; or other fouling on the &quot;backup&quot; spark plugs.

In almost all general aviation piston engines, the fuel mixture is directly controlled by the pilot, via a knob and cable or lever similar to (and next to) the throttle control. Leaningreducing the mixture from its maximum amount – must be done with knowledge, as some combinations of fuel mixture and throttle position (that produce the highest ) can cause detonation and/or pre-ignition, in the worst case destroying the engine within seconds. Pilots are taught in primary training to avoid settings that produce the highest exhaust gas temperatures, and run the engine either &quot;rich of peak EGT&quot; (more fuel than can be burned with the available air) or &quot;lean of peak&quot; (less fuel, leaving some oxygen in the exhaust) as either will keep the fuel-air mixture from detonating prematurely. Because of the high cost of unleaded, high-octane avgas, and possible increased range before refueling, some general aviation pilots attempt to save money by tuning their fuel-air mixtures and ignition timing to run &quot;lean of peak&quot;. Additionally, the decreased air density at higher altitudes (such as Colorado) and temperatures (as in summer) requires leaning (reduction in amount of fuel per volume or mass of air) for the peak EGT and power (crucial for takeoff).

==Regional variations==
The selection of octane ratings available at filling stations can vary greatly between countries.
* Australia: &quot;regular&quot; unleaded fuel is 91 RON, &quot;premium&quot; unleaded with 95 RON is widely available, and 98 RON fuel is also very common. Shell used to sell 100 RON fuel (5% ethanol content) from a small number of service stations, most of which are located in major cities (stopped in August 2008). United Petroleum used to sell 100 RON unleaded fuel (10% ethanol content) at a small number of its service stations (originally only two, but then expanded to 67 outlets nationwide) (stopped in September 2014). All fuel in Australia is unleaded except for some aviation fuels. E85 unleaded fuel is also available at several United service stations across the country. By 2018, E10 fuel had become quite common, and is available at almost every major fuel station, except in Western Australia.
* Bahrain: 91 and 95 (RON), standard in all gasoline stations in the country and advertised as (Jayyid) for Regular or 91 and (Mumtaz) for Premium or 95 and 98 (RON) as super.
* Bangladesh: Two types of fuel are available at petrol stations in Bangladesh. Motor Gasoline Regular (marketed as &quot;Petrol&quot;) which has RON 80 rating, and Motor Gasoline Premium (marketed as &quot;Octane&quot;) which has RON 95 rating. Petrol stations in Bangladesh are privatised, but the prices are regulated by the authorities and have a fixed price at BDT 86.00 (US$1.04) and BDT 89.00 (US$1.07) (as of 1 March 2018) per litre respectively.
* Botswana: 93 and 95 RON are standard at almost all gas stations thorough Botswana. The two types are unleaded.
* Brazil: As defined by federal law, the RON standard is used and all types of gasoline sold in all gas stations throughout the country are unleaded (the latter since 1991). By default, it was defined by the federal government that the regular (and the lowest) octane standard in Brazil is 93 RON, known in Portuguese as &quot;Gasolina Comum&quot; (English: &quot;Common Gasoline&quot;) – Petrobras stations brand it as &quot;Gasolina Regular&quot; (English: &quot;Regular Gasoline&quot;). This type of gasoline can be found in most Brazilian petrol stations and does not have any additives, except the inclusion of 27,5% of ethanol (as required by the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels – Portuguese: &quot;Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis&quot; or simply &quot;ANP&quot; – since 2011). Along with the &quot;Common&quot; gasoline, there is a second type of gasoline that can also be found in most stations in Brazil. This gasoline is also mixed with 27,5% of ethanol (to comply with the ANP regulation, that prohibits the sale of the 100% &quot;pure gasoline&quot; compound in all Brazilian stations), but a few detergent and dispersant additives are also included in the compound. This type of gasoline is known in Portuguese as &quot;Gasolina Aditivada&quot; (English: &quot;Additived Gasoline&quot;) – Petrobras stations brand it as &quot;Petrobras Grid&quot;; nevertheless, the octane rating is also 93 RON (these additives are used to improve the performance and efficiency of the engine, but they are not indicative of a higher octane rating). However, higher octane levels of gasoline are found in many stations (all stations in Brazil, regardless of the octane rating, have to conform the ANP requirement of 27,5% of ethanol mixed with the gasoline, and both &quot;Common&quot; and &quot;Additived&quot; gasolines can also be found in most of these stations), such as the &quot;Premium Gasoline&quot; (known in Portuguese as &quot;Gasolina Premium&quot; – 98 RON), the &quot;OctaPro&quot; (103 RON), sold at Ipiranga stations, and the &quot;Petrobras Podium&quot; (102 RON), sold at Petrobras stations.
* Canada: in Canada octane rating is displayed in AKI. In most areas, the standard grades are 87 (regular), 89 (mid-grade) and 91–94 (premium) AKI. In the Atlantic Provinces, gasoline is often available without any blend of ethanol, but only up to 91 AKI.
* China: From January 1, 2000, all fuel stations offer unleaded fuel only. Now,92 RON and 95 RON (previously 90 RON, 93 RON and 97 RON) are commonly offered. Some state-run gas stations (Sinopec, PetroChina) in various cities sell 98 RON, but not all. Private gas stations outside of China&#x27;s Shandong province rarely offer 98 RON. In most rural areas it can be difficult to find fuel with over 95 RON. In backward provinces and regions, only ethanol gasoline containing 10% ethanol is allowed to be sold: 92E10, 95E10 and 98E10, Some gas pumps use the labels &quot;E92, E95 and E98&quot;, but they still represent E10 ethanol gasoline of 92 RON, 95 RON and 98 RON. Sinopec&#x27;s 98 RON gasoline is called &quot;X-power&quot;, and PetroChina&#x27;s 98 RON gasoline is called &quot;CN98&quot;. China&#x27;s National VI gasoline standard has completely banned the use of metal anti-knock agents, because metal anti-knock agents such as MMT and ferrocene will clog the car&#x27;s GPF, but gasoline vehicles that meet the National VI emission standards must install GPF.
* Chile: 93, 95 and 97 RON are standard at almost all gas stations thorough Chile. The three types are unleaded.
* Colombia: &quot;Ecopetrol&quot;, Colombia&#x27;s monopoly of refining and distribution of gasoline establishes a minimum AKI of 81 octanes for &quot;Corriente&quot; gasoline and minimum AKI of 87 octanes for &quot;Extra&quot; gasoline. (91.5 RON corriente, and 95 RON for extra)
* Costa Rica: RECOPE, Costa Rica&#x27;s distribution monopoly, establishes the following ratings: Plus 91 (at least 91 RON) and Super (at least 95 RON).
* Croatia: All fuel stations offer unleaded &quot;Eurosuper BS&quot; (abbreviation &quot;BS&quot; meaning &quot;no sulfur content&quot;) 95 RON fuel, many also offer &quot;Eurosuper Plus BS&quot; 98 RON. Some companies offer 100 RON fuel instead of 98.
* Cyprus: All fuel stations offer unleaded 95 and 98 RON, and a few offer 100 RON as well.
* Denmark: 95 RON is a common budget choice, with 95 and 98 being widely available, and 92 rarely seen as it has been phased out during the 2010s. A selection of brands offers &gt;=100 options, under trademarked names. However several fuel stations are phasing out 92 RON. By law, it is decided that all gasoline companies from July 2010 to January 2020 should use a mix containing 5% bioethanol in the gasoline and increased to 10% after January 2020.
* Ecuador: &quot;Extra&quot; and Ecopais (5% etanol) with 85 RON, &quot;Eco Plus&quot; with 89 RON and &quot;Super Premium&quot; with 95 (RON). Extra/Ecopais and Super Premium are available in all fuel stations. &quot;Extra&quot; is the most commonly used. All fuels are unleaded.
* Egypt: Egyptian fuel stations had 90 RON until July 2014 when the government found no remaining use for it, leaving only 92 RON and 95 RON. 80 RON is found in a very limited number of fuel stations as they are used only for extremely old cars that cannot cope with high octane fuel. 95 RON was used limitedly due to its high price (more than twice the price of 92 RON). But after the increasing the prices again in 2018, 95 RON price became only 15% higher than 92 RON, so it started to gain popularity.
* Estonia: 95 RON and 98 RON are widely available. E85 (bioethanol) gasoline found in very few gas stations.
* Finland: 95 and 98 (RON), advertised as such, at almost all gas stations. Most cars run on 95, but 98 is available for vehicles that need higher octane fuel, or older models containing parts easily damaged by high ethanol content. Shell offers V-Power, advertised as &quot;over 99 octane&quot;, instead of 98. In the beginning of 2011 95 RON was replaced by 95E10 containing 10% ethanol, and 98 RON by 98E5, containing 5% ethanol. ST1 also offers RE85 on some stations, which is 85% ethanol made from biodegradable waste (from which the advertised name &quot;ReFuel&quot; comes). RE85 is only suitable for flexifuel cars that can run on high-percentage ethanol.
* Germany: &quot;Super E5 and E10&quot; 95 RON and &quot;Super Plus E5&quot; 98 RON are available practically everywhere. Big suppliers such as Shell or Aral offer 100 RON gasoline (Shell V-Power, Aral Ultimate) at almost every fuel station. &quot;Normal&quot; 91 RON is only rarely offered because lower production amounts make it more expensive than &quot;Super&quot; 95 RON. Due to a new European Union law, gas stations are being required to offer a minimum rate of the new mixture of &quot;Super&quot; 95 RON with up to 10% ethanol branded as &quot;Super E10&quot;.
* Greece (Hellas): 95 RON (standard unleaded), 98 &amp; 100 RON unleaded offered by some companies (e.g., EKO, Shell, BP).
* Hong Kong: only 98 RON is available in the market. There have been calls to re-introduce 95 RON, but the calls have been rejected by all automotive fuel station chains, citing that 95 RON was phased out because of market forces.
* India: India&#x27;s ordinary and premium petrol options are of 91 RON. The premium petrols are generally ordinary fuels with additives, that do not really change the octane value. Two variants, &quot;Speed 93&quot; and &quot;Speed 97&quot;, were launched, with RON values of 93 and 97. In 2017, Hindustan Petroleum launched poWer 99 with an RON value of 99 which was initially available only in Bangalore, Pune and now in Mumbai but was expected to roll out in other major cities soon. India&#x27;s economy-class vehicles usually have compression ratios under 10:1, thus enabling them to use lower-octane petrol without engine knocking.
* Indonesia: Indonesia&#x27;s &quot;Premium&quot; gasoline, rated at 88 RON, was the lowest grade gasoline, but was phased out by 2021. Other options have been &quot;Pertalite&quot;, rated at 90 RON; &quot;Pertamax&quot;, rated at 92 RON; &quot;Pertamax Plus&quot;, rated at 95 RON (now replaced by Pertamax Green in July 2023); and &quot;Pertamax Racing&quot;, a 100 RON fuel sold in selected stations. From August 2016, Pertamina began selling &quot;Pertamax Turbo&quot;, rated at 98 RON, as a replacement for Pertamax Plus. Total and Shell stations only sell RON 92 and 95 gasoline. Shell launched a new variant, &quot;Regular&quot;, rated at 90 RON, in early 2018, but this was discontinued in January 2022. However, after 6 years of discontinuation of Pertamax Plus, In July 2023 Pertamina launched the Pertamax Green 95 which made of sugarcane and a mixture of Pertamax 92 and the price is slightly cheaper than Pertamax Turbo which rated 98 RON.
* Iran: &#x27;regular&#x27; gasoline has an octane rating of 87 RON, which is the most prevalent type of gasoline available throughout the country. Select gas stations within major cities also offer &#x27;Super&#x27; 95 RON. Due to high air pollution, an environmentally cleaner variety, marketed as Euro-4, is being introduced in metropolitan areas instead of the Regular, which boasts an octane rating of 91 RON and sulphur levels not exceeding 50 ppm.
* Ireland: 95 RON &quot;unleaded&quot; is the only gasoline type available through stations, although E5 (99 RON) is becoming more commonplace.
* Italy: 95 RON is the only compulsory gasoline offered (&quot;verde&quot;, &quot;green&quot;), only a few fuel stations (Agip, IP, IES, OMV) offer 98 RON as the premium type, many Shell and Tamoil stations close to the cities offer also V-Power Gasoline rated at 100 RON. Recently Agip introduced &quot;Blu Super+&quot;, a 100 RON gasoline.
* Israel: 95 RON &amp; 98 RON are normally available at most automotive fuel stations. 96 RON is no longer available as of 2010. 95 RON is preferred because it is cheaper and performance differences are not significant. &quot;Regular&quot; fuel is 95 RON. All variants are unleaded.
* Japan: &quot;Regular&quot; unleaded fuel is 90 RON and &quot;High-octane&quot; (&quot;Premium&quot;) fuel is about 100 RON, or in fact 99.5 RON according to some suppliers, at least until around 2021. The minimum values are defined in standard JIS K 2202: &quot;Regular&quot; is &gt;=89.0 RON, and &quot;High-octane&quot; is &gt;=96.0 RON, since the revision of 1986. It means &quot;High-octane&quot; has a higher octane rating than the JIS standard. Although 99.5 RON is not defined, there is no significant difference in &quot;High-octane&quot; from different suppliers according to the president of the Petroleum Association of Japan, and it is believed that each has almost the same octane rating (99.5 RON) in spite of the JIS. But the actual octane rating is not clear and it can be sold as &quot;High-octane&quot; as long as it is 96.0 RON or more. &quot;High-octane&quot; was formerly sometimes advertised as &quot;Octane 100&quot;, but this practice was abandoned as its actual octane value was less than 100 RON.
* Latvia: 95 RON and 98 RON are widely available.
* Lebanon: 95 RON and 98 RON are widely available.
* Lithuania: 95 RON and 98 RON are widely available. In some gas stations E85 (bioethanol) gasoline, 98E15 (15% of ethanol), 98E25 (25% of ethanol) are available.
* Malaysia: 95 RON, 97 RON and 100 RON. &quot;Regular&quot; unleaded fuel is 95 RON; &quot;Premium&quot; fuel is rated at 97 RON (Shell&#x27;s V-Power Racing is rated minimum 97 RON). Petron sells 100 RON in selected outlets.
* Mexico: The standard octane index is 87 AKI for regular fuel and anywhere from 91 to 93 AKI for premium fuel, although 91 AKI is the most common octane number for premium fuel. Valero is the only station offering 93 AKI fuel in Mexico, at a premium of 5% to 10% over standard 91 AKI fuel. Valero stations are usually present in main cities, such as Monterrey, Guadalajara, Querétaro and Puebla. From 1938 to 2018, Mexican government held a monopoly in the distribution of fuel, and its brands for unleaded fuel were &quot;Pemex Magna&quot; and &quot;Pemex Premium&quot;, appearing in the early 1990s, before that, fuel was usually leaded. Mexican regulations do not enforce any particular labels to identify different grades of fuel as long as each grade is clearly labeled with distinct names and colors, but the long history of Pemex&#x27;s colors has established a tradition of labeling regular fuel with green, premium fuel with red, and diesel with black. Gas station brands that use different colors include Shell, BP, Mobil and Akron.
* Mongolia: 92 RON and 95 RON (advertised as A92 and A95 respectively) are available at nearly all stations while slightly fewer stations offer 80 RON (advertised as A80). 98 RON (advertised as A98) is available in select few stations.
* Montenegro: 95 RON is sold as a &quot;regular&quot; fuel. As a &quot;premium&quot; fuel, 98 RON is sold. Both variants are unleaded.
* Myanmar: Most petrol stations carry 92 RON as standard especially in rural areas. Most larger cities and highway stations have introduced 95 RON in the past few years. The highest grade available is 97 RON which is only sold by a few stations in Yangon and Nay Pyi Taw (e.g., PTT, MMTM, Petrotrans).
* Netherlands: 95 RON &quot;Euro&quot; is sold at every station, whereas 98 RON &quot;Super Plus&quot; is being phased out in favor of &quot;premium&quot; fuels, which are all 95 RON fuels with extra additives. Shell V-Power is a 97 RON (labelled as 95 due to the legalities of only using 95 or 98 labelling), some independent tests have shown that one year after introduction it was downgraded to 95 RON, whereas in neighboring Germany Shell V-Power consists of the regular 100 RON fuel.
* New Zealand: 91 RON &quot;Regular&quot; and 95 RON &quot;Premium&quot; are both widely available. 98 RON is available instead of 95 RON at some (BP, Mobil, Gull) service stations in larger urban areas (newer BP stations also offer 95 by blending 91 and 98 where 98 is available). 100 RON is available at selected NPD service stations in the South Island and in very limited locations in the North Island.
* Norway: 95 RON are widely available, but 98 RON is also available at Shell, here it goes under the name v-power; it is 10-20% more expensive as 95 RON fuel. In 2023 95 RON fuel got change to 95E10 and 98 RON to 98E5. SHELL still has 98 octane under the name v-power, but also most of the Esso gas stations have 98 octane fuel as well.
* Oman: 91 RON, 95 RON and 98 RON. &quot;Regular&quot; unleaded fuel is 91 RON; &quot;Premium&quot; fuel is rated at 95 RON; 98 RON in selected outlets.
* Pakistan: 3 types of fuel available. 92, HOBC 95 &amp; HOBC 97 RON. Super marketed as 92 RON, 95 RON marketed by Shell as V-Power and 97 RON by Total Parco Pakistan &amp; Pakistan State Oil (PSO). HOBC pricing was deregulated in October, 2016.
* Philippines: All automotive fuels are unleaded since December 23, 2000. Since late 2013, three grades of gasoline are available: Premium Plus, Premium (mid-grade) and Regular. Law requires the Premium Plus grade to be 97 RON or higher; Premium at 95 RON; Regular at 91 RON. Premium Plus grade fuels are exempted from having an ethanol blend, although the only Premium Plus grade available without ethanol is Petron Blaze and is rated at 100 RON. Other Premium Plus grades like Seaoil Extreme 97, Shell V-Power Racing and Unioil Gas 97 are rated at 97 RON, while Phoenix Premium 98 is rated at 98 RON. Premium grades such as Caltex Gold, Petron XCS, Phoenix Premium 95, Seaoil Extreme 95, Shell V-Power Nitro+, Unioil Gas 95 and Total Excellium are rated at 95 RON. Regular grades such as Caltex Silver, Petron Xtra Unleaded, Phoenix Super Regular 91, Seaoil Extreme U+, Shell FuelSave Unleaded, Unioil Gas 91 and Total Premier are rated at 91 RON.
* Poland: Eurosuper 95 (RON 95) is sold in every gas station. Super Plus 98 (RON 98) is available in most stations, sometimes under brand (Orlen – Verva, BP – Ultimate, Shell – V-Power) and usually containing additives. Shell offers V-Power Racing fuel which is rated RON 100.
* Portugal: 95 RON &quot;Euro&quot; is sold in every station and 98 RON &quot;Super&quot; being offered in almost every station.
* Russia: In the Soviet Union there were different grades of automobile gasoline, which had the following names: A-56, A-66, A-70, A-72, A-74, A-76, AI-93, AI-95 also known as &quot;Extra&quot;, and B-70 (aviation gasoline). The first letter indicated the vehicle for which the gasoline was intended, the number indicated the octane. Gasolines A-56 and A-66, A-70, and later A-72, were intended for cars with flat-head engines produced in the 1930s-1960s. Gasolines A-74, later A-76 and AI-93 for cars with overhead valve engines produced in the 1960s-1980s. AI-95 gasoline was mainly for foreign cars or government limousines ZiL and Chaika. The letter &quot;I&quot; in the AI-93 and AI-95 brands indicated that the octane number was calculated using the research method. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, A-76 gasoline was replaced by AI-80, and AI-93 by AI-92. By the early 1980s, production of A-66 gasoline ceased, and about a decade later, so did A-72. Nowadays 92 RON is the minimum available, the standard is 95 RON is sold in every gas station. 98 RON is available in most stations. As a &quot;premium&quot; fuel, 100 RON is sold, Gazpromneft and Lukoil both variants are unleaded.
* Saudi Arabia: Two types of fuel are available at all petrol stations in Saudi Arabia. &quot;Premium 91&quot; (RON 91) has green pumps, and &quot;Super Premium 95&quot; (RON 95) where the pumps are red. Fuel dyes are used to make the colour of the fuel match that of the pump. While petrol stations in Saudi Arabia are privatised, the prices are regulated by the authorities and have a fixed at SR 1.44 (US$0.38) and SR 2.10 (US$0.56) (as of 14 April 2019) per litre respectively; and is currently being increased at a quarterly rate to bring it up to the worldwide average by 2020. Prior to 2006, only Super Premium RON 95 was available and the pumps were not systematically coloured. The public did not know what octane rating was, so education campaigns were started, advising people to use &quot;red petrol&quot; only for high end cars, and to save money by using &quot;green petrol&quot; for regular cars and trucks.
* Singapore: All four providers, Caltex, ExxonMobil, SPC and Shell have 3 grades of gasoline. Typically, these are 92, 95, and 98 RON. However, since 2009, Shell has removed 92 RON.
* South Africa: &quot;regular&quot; unleaded fuel is 95 RON in coastal areas. Inland (higher elevation) &quot;regular&quot; unleaded fuel is 93 RON; once again most fuel stations optionally offer 95 RON.
* South Korea: &quot;regular&quot; unleaded fuel is 91~94 RON, &quot;premium&quot; is 95+ RON nationally. However, not all gas stations carry &quot;premium.&quot;
* Spain: 95 RON &quot;Euro&quot; is sold in every station with 98 RON &quot;Super&quot; being offered in most stations. Many stations around cities and highways offer other high-octane &quot;premium&quot; brands.
* Sri Lanka: Sri Lanka switched their regular gasoline from 90 RON to 92 RON on January 1, 2014. In Ceypetco filling stations, 92 RON is the regular automotive fuel and 95 RON is called &#x27;Super Petrol&#x27;, which comes at a premium price. In LIOC filling stations, 92 RON is the regular automotive fuel and 95 RON is available as &#x27;Premium Petrol&#x27;. As of 2022, LIOC fillings stations offer a new fuel labelled as &#x27;XtraPremium&#x27; Petrol which is marketed as &#x27;Euro 3&#x27; standard petrol. Similarly 95 RON petrol is offered as &#x27;XtraPremium&#x27; 95 Petrol. Sri Lanka adopted RON 100 Octane 100 from July 2024. It is the 8th country in the world to use RON 100.
* Sweden: 95 RON, 98 RON and E85 are widely available.
* Taiwan: 92 RON, 95 RON and 98 RON are widely available at gas stations in Taiwan.
* Thailand: 95 RON E0, 95 RON E10, 91 RON E10, 95 RON E20 are widely available in all parts of Thailand. 97 RON E10 fuel is also available in some Bangchak&#x27;s filling stations in many parts of Thailand.
* Trinidad and Tobago: 92 RON (Super) and 95 RON (Premium) are widely available.
* Turkey: 95 RON and 95+ RON widely available in gas stations. 91 RON (Regular) has been dropped in 2006. 98 and 100 RON (Shell V-Power Racing) has been dropped in late 2009. The Gas which has been advertised 97 RON has been dropped in 2014 and renamed 95+.
* Ukraine: 80 RON and 98 RON gasoline is available. The standard gasoline is 95 RON, but 92 RON gasoline is also widely available and popular for older cars. There is no government regulation for gasoline with RON higher than 98 so some stations are marketing 100 RON gasoline when in reality this can be anything above 98 RON with extra cleaning additives.
* United Kingdom: &#x27;regular&#x27; gasoline has an octane rating of 95 RON, with 97 RON fuel being widely available as the &quot;Super Unleaded&quot;. Tesco and Shell both offer 99 RON fuel. In April 2006, BP started a public trial of the super-high octane gasoline &quot;BP Ultimate Unleaded 102&quot;, which as the name suggests, has an octane rating of 102 RON. Although BP Ultimate Unleaded (with an octane rating of 97 RON) and BP Ultimate Diesel are both widely available throughout the UK, BP Ultimate Unleaded 102 was available throughout the UK in only 10 filling stations, and was priced at about two and half times more than their 97 RON fuel. In March 2010, BP stopped sales of Ultimate Unleaded 102, citing the closure of their specialty fuels manufacturing facility. Shell V-Power is also available, but in a 99 RON octane rating, and Tesco fuel stations also supply the Greenergy produced 99 RON &quot;Momentum99&quot;.
* United States: in the US octane rating is displayed in AKI. In most areas, the standard grades are 87, 89–90, and 91–94 AKI. In the Rocky Mountain (high elevation) states, 85 AKI (90 RON) is the minimum octane, and 91 AKI (95 RON) is the maximum octane available in fuel. The reason for this is that in higher-elevation areas, a typical naturally aspirated engine draws in less air mass per cycle because of the reduced density of the atmosphere. This directly translates to less fuel and reduced absolute compression in the cylinder, therefore deterring knock. It is safe to fill a carbureted car that normally takes 87 AKI fuel at sea level with 85 AKI fuel in the mountains, but at sea level the fuel may cause damage to the engine. Fuel injectors have almost completely replaced carburettors in nearly all modern automobiles produced from the late 1980s and early 1990s onwards. 85 AKI fuel is not recommended for modern automobiles and may cause damage to the engine and decreased performance. Another disadvantage to this strategy is that most turbocharged vehicles are unable to produce full power, even when using the &quot;premium&quot; 91 AKI fuel. In some east coast states, up to 94 AKI (99 or 100 RON) is available. As of January 2011, over 40 states and a total of over 2500 stations offer ethanol-based E-85 fuel with 94–96 AKI. Often, filling stations near US racing tracks will offer higher octane levels such as 100 AKI from separate dedicated pumps.

* Venezuela: 91 RON and 95 RON gasoline is available nationwide, in all PDV gas stations. 95 RON gasoline is the most widely used in the country, although most cars in Venezuela would work with 91 RON gasoline. This is because gasoline prices are heavily subsidized by the government (US$0.0083 per gallon 95 RON, vs US$0.0061 per gallon 91 RON). All gasoline in Venezuela is unleaded.
* Vietnam: 92 RON is in every gas station and 95 RON is in the urban area. They start selling A92-E5 gasoline (92 RON with 5 percent of ethanol) at 2017. On January 1, 2018, Vietnamese government forced every gas station stop selling 92 RON and sell 95 RON + A92-E5 instead. From 2022, Vietnam will start selling gasoline according to Euro 5 standards, with the choices 95 RON and 97 RON(in SFC gas stations).
* Zimbabwe: 93 octane available with no other grades of fuels available, E10 which is an ethanol blend of fuel at 10% ethanol is available the octane rating however is still to be tested and confirmed but it is assumed that it is around 95 Octane. E85 available from 3 outlets with an octane rating AKI index of between 102 and 105 depending on the base gasoline the ethanol is blended with.

== Misconceptions around octane rating ==

Due to its name, the chemical &quot;octane&quot; is often misunderstood as the only substance that determines the octane rating (or octane number) of a fuel. This is an inaccurate description. In reality, the octane rating is defined as a number describing the stability and ability of a fuel to prevent an engine from unwanted combustions that occur spontaneously in the other regions within a cylinder (i.e., delocalized explosions from the spark plug). This phenomenon of combustion is more commonly known as engine knocking or self-ignition, which causes damage to pistons over time and reduces the lifespan of engines.

In 1927, Graham Edgar devised the method of using iso-octane and n-heptane as reference chemicals, in order to rate the knock resistance of a fuel with respect to this isomer of octane, thus the name &quot;octane rating&quot;. By definition, the isomers &quot;iso-octane&quot; and &quot;n-heptane&quot; have an octane rating of 100 and 0, respectively. Because of its more volatile nature, n-heptane ignites and knocks readily, which gives it a relatively low octane rating; the isomer iso-octane causes less knocking because it is more branched and combusts more smoothly. In general, branched compounds with a higher intermolecular force (e.g., London dispersion force for iso-octane) will have a higher octane rating, because they are harder to ignite.

=== Octane ratings of octane isomers ===
Octane isomers such as &quot;n-octane&quot; and &quot;2,3,3-trimethylpentane&quot; have an octane rating of -20 and 106.1, respectively (RON measurement). The large differences between the octane ratings for the isomers show that the compound octane itself is clearly not the only factor that determines octane ratings, especially for commercial fuels consist of a wide variety of compounds.

== Octane in culture ==

&quot;Octane&quot; is colloquially used in the expression &quot;high-octane&quot;. The term is used to describe a powerful action because of the association with the concept of &quot;octane rating&quot;. This is a misleading term, because the octane rating of gasoline is not directly related to the power output of an engine. Using gasoline of a higher octane than an engine is designed for cannot increase its power output.

Octane became well known in American popular culture in the 1960s, when gasoline companies boasted of &quot;high octane&quot; levels in their gasoline advertisements. The compound adjective &quot;high-octane&quot;, meaning powerful or dynamic, is recorded in a figurative sense from 1944. By the 1990s, the phrase was commonly being used as a word intensifier, and it has found a place in modern English slang.

<text>The Zapotec (Valley Zapotec: &quot;Bën za&quot;) are an Indigenous people of Mexico. Their population is primarily concentrated in the southern state of Oaxaca, but Zapotec communities also exist in neighboring states. The present-day population is estimated at 400,000 to 650,000, many of whom are monolingual in one of the Native Zapotec languages and dialects. 

In pre-Columbian times, the Zapotec civilization was one of the highly developed cultures of Mesoamerica that had a Zapotec writing system. 

Many people of Zapotec ancestry have emigrated to the United States over several decades. They maintain their own social organizations in the Los Angeles and Central Valley areas of California.

There are four basic groups of Zapotec: the &#x27;, who live in the southern [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]]; the&#x27;, who live in the northern mountains of the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca; the southern Zapotec, who live in the southern mountains of the Sierra Sur; and the Central Valley Zapotec, who live in and around the Valley of Oaxaca.

==Name==
The Zapotecs call themselves , which means “The People.” 

For decades it was believed that the exonym &quot;Zapotec&quot; came from the Nahuatl &#x27; (singular &#x27;), which means &quot;inhabitants of the place of sapote&quot;. Recent studies carried out by UNAM argue that it may be a hybrid word and should be written Zapochteca or Zaapochteca and comes from &quot;za / zaa&quot; (cloud) and &quot;pochteca&quot; (merchant).

==History==
Although several theories of the origin of the Zapotec peoples exist, including some possibly influenced in the post-conquest period, scholars largely agree the Zapotecs inhabited the Central Valley of Oaxaca as early as 500 to 300 BCE, during what is considered the Monte Alban I period. During this period, the Zapotecs established a significant system of governance over the population of the region. The Monte Alban periods, of which five have been categorized, lasted from 500 BCE to the time of conquest in 1521 CE. Yet archaeological evidence from the site of Monte Alban, &quot;the first city in ancient Mesoamerica&quot; has revealed settlement of the region as far back as 1150 BCE. Scholars have been able to correlate with the Formative, Classic, and post-Classic periods of civilization in the region within the greater Mesoamerican history through these discoveries. 

The Formative stage, from about 500 BCE to 200 CE of which the periods of Monte Alban I and II are attributed to, is characterized by a shift to sedentary settlements and the practice of agriculture for subsistence. From 200 to 900 CE in the Monte Alban III period, the Classic stage witnessed the rise of social and political structures in the Zapotec civilization. This period also saw a surge in religious activity within the state leadership of the society. Later, during the &quot;Militaristic stage&quot; of Monte Alban IV–V from around 900 to 1521 CE, a rise in military influence common among Mesoamerican societies led states to become mired in warfare and &quot;cults of war&quot;.

==Culture==

===Language===

The Zapotecan language group is composed of over 60 variants of Zapotecan, as well as the closely related Chatino language. The major variant is Isthmus Zapotec, which is spoken on the Pacific coastal plain of Southern Oaxaca&#x27;s Isthmus of Tehuantepec.

===Religion===
&quot;See also: List of Zapotec deities&quot;

Though the Zapotecs are now largely Catholics, some of their ancient beliefs and practices, such as the burial of the dead with valuables, still survive. Some images of local Catholic saints resemble the old gods of the Zapotecs. One example is of San Pedro who resembles the Zapotec rain god Cocijo. The first missionaries among the Zapotecs were Bartolomé de Olmeda, a Mercedarian, and Juan Díaz, a secular priest, who was killed by the natives in Quechula near Tepeaca for having &quot;overthrown their idols&quot;.

Notably, while the Virgen de Guadalupe is a notable Catholic figure in most of Mexico and Latin America, the Virgen de Juquila is a Catholic Marian devotion founded in the town of Santa Catarina Juquila, in the Mexican state of Oaxaca. Many Zapotec Catholic people participate in an annual pilgrimage to visit the statue during festivities lasting from December 7 to December 9.

At the time of the Spanish conquest of the New World, church and state were not separate in Zapotec society. In fact, the Zapotec lord was trained in religious practice as a requirement prior to taking power. There were large temples built called &quot;yo hopèe,&quot; the house of the vital force, in which the priests performed religious rites. In the spiritual realm the &quot;pè&quot;, or life force, lived within various natural elements including wind, breath and was believed to be the spirit, or vital force, of all beings. The priests, known as &quot;Copa pitào,&quot; who were mostly selected from the nobility, were provided their religious training before taking a position among the religious hierarchy. Commoners were also selected and trained to join the priesthood, but they were only allowed to join the lower ranks. The highest position was held by the &quot;ouija-tào,&quot; great seer, who was likened to the Pope in the Catholic church by Spanish accounts of the sixteenth century. However, the ouija-tào did not live in Monte Alban, but rather in one of the other urban centers of the Zapotecs in the sub-valley area of Mitla. As a polytheistic religion, the Zapotecs attributed several elements of the natural world to their gods. In the religious practice of the Valley Zapotecs, the primary god was &quot;Pitao Cozobi&quot; who was associated with maize and agriculture. Other gods include, &quot;Cocijo&quot; the god of rain and lightning (similar to the Toltec god, Tlaloc); &quot;Pitao Cozaana&quot; the creator of man, animals and the god of ancestors; &quot;Pitao Hichaana&quot; the goddess of man and animals as well as children, also considered the Mother goddess; &quot;Pitao Pezelao&quot; god of the underworld, death, and the earth; &quot;Copijcha&quot; the Sun god and god of war; &quot;Pitao Xicala&quot; god of love, dreams, and excess.

==Zapotec women==

Zapotec women in the Mexican state of Oaxaca play a variety of social roles in their families and communities. As is true for many other cultures, Zapotec women have historically had a different place in society than men. These roles are in the context of marriage, childbearing, and work. Within them, they make up a vital part of the fabric that is Zapotec Oaxaca.

===Women&#x27;s autonomy===

Much of Zapotec social life is strongly segregated by sex. Men and women often work separately, coming together to eat in the morning and evening, and during ritual occasions, they remain separate except when dancing.&quot; The purity of women is highly valued and their sexual and social autonomy can be hindered as a result. &quot;Most women in the community, whether old or young, are concerned with protecting their sexual reputations. Many girls are still strictly watched and not allowed to walk the streets alone after the age of ten or eleven.&quot; Though this is seen as a way to protect the women, it nevertheless restricts their behavior.

Women are generally free to choose romantic partners; monogamy is valued, but having multiple sexual partners is not. However, for men and women this differs slightly; again for women virginity is regarded as important, even to the extent of publicly displaying the bloody sheet from the wedding night for some, an ancient Mediterranean custom brought by the Spaniards, while unmarried men are encouraged to experiment before they marry.
This follows from the fact that &quot;paternity is uncertainty.&quot; Women always know a child is their own, but a man cannot be so sure. Thus men need assurance of paternity to be willing to put in decades of support for a child. Within marriage, the degree to which women are able to exercise agency depends on the husband. Some women are very free and have the ability to do as they wish, while others may have very controlling husbands; either way, however, women&#x27;s freedom is determined by their spouse. &quot;While some men jealously guarded their wives (even insisting on driving them to the marketplace), others [allow] their wives and daughters considerable independence.&quot; The issue of domestic violence is not necessarily commonplace.

===Household function===
In addition to playing an important role in the family as wives and daughters, another important role for the Zapotec women is that of the mother. Childbearing and rearing are female duties. It is the women&#x27;s job to take on the responsibility of the children, while she is also expected to be the one to take care of the household in terms of the cooking, cleaning, &quot;et cetera&quot;. In addition to all of this, many poor women are also expected to work to help support the family. &quot;Women, therefore, must work to contribute to their family income, in addition to attending to their traditional household tasks of child care and food.&quot;

===Labor function===
In Zapotec Oaxaca, the gendered implications of labor give different tasks to men and women. Because women are also responsible for caring for the children and the home, the outside work they do must revolve around those duties.

:&quot;In the past during an agriculturally dominant time, most agricultural activities associated with planting and harvesting are carried out directly by men, women also participate in the agricultural production. In particular, female household workers help with weeding and harvesting. Seldom is a female seen planting or plowing. When no male labor is available, however, women also work in planting. The majority of female labor was directed toward supplying male workers with food during agricultural activities and providing supplemental labor during weeding and harvesting.&quot;

However, with the onset of globalized industry and Mexico&#x27;s transition from an agricultural economy to one revolving around services and manufacturing, the ideas about women and work have been shifting dramatically. Women now see a way that they can participate in the market economy to make extra money for their families, and still are able to maintain the additional work they do at home which has no monetary value. As men are migrating for other, mostly industrial, work opportunities and agrarian work is decreasing, women have come to dominate the textile industry, which caters mainly to tourists. Weaving and factory life has become a way of life for many Zapotec women in Oaxaca.

:&quot;Clothing is a relatively new industry which began about 1960. Sewing on treadle-type sewing machines has been practiced in [areas of Oaxaca] since about 1940, when they were brought into the area by the Singer Company. Shortly after that, women who since pre-Columbian times had contributed to the subsistence of their families by weaving, began to make and design men&#x27;s ready-made shirts and trousers for sale in the local market and the global markets.&quot;

The industry has had a significant impact on the wage-earning opportunity of Zapotec women. Workers in Teotitlan&#x27;s textile industry employ a variety of strategies and systems of production [from] piecework production...increased direct control over production and distribution...weaving cooperatives...establishment of households and small businesses in Oaxaca... [to] subcontracting of weaving in Teotitlan and surrounding communities.&quot;

As women are increasingly working and involved in the market because of their contribution to the industry, the role they have in society is changing in relation to other aspects of their lives.

:&quot;While women in the community have common social roles based on their gendered positions as wives, mothers, and daughters, these roles are modified by the position of their household as workers or merchants. In their discussions of differences among themselves, women particularly emphasized merchant or worker status, specifically in the role of each in local labor relations.&quot;

The merchant has come to symbolize a higher class status than the worker because they are the individuals who essentially control the market.
For Zapotec communities, occupations are divided by gender. While men have a place in the industry as overseers, it is still primarily considered to be &#x27;women&#x27;s work&#x27;. Furthermore, even though the manufacturing industry has been thriving on a global scale, because of the gender separation of labor, there is a lower value placed on the work. Local industry is not seen as a glorious business in the Zapotec community because it is essentially controlled by women.

:&quot;In general, the women [in Zapotec communities] are considered productively inferior to men. Their ability to contribute to the economy and family are respected but, they are believed to be less capable than men as managers and their work is looked upon as insignificant. In consequence Yaletecos do not see the manufacturing industry as an industry. Although shirt making like other women&#x27;s work is visible in itself, it is not an industry, but is perceived as part of the category of women&#x27;s work comprising weaving, sewing, and embroidery. In contrast, men&#x27;s occupations are identifiable, and a man is known by the type of work he performs.&quot;

Teotiteco industrial exports, such as textiles, clothing and manufactured goods such as electronics and white goods, are being absorbed into the U.S. consumer market and shifting the local economy of Oaxaca from a small community of workers and merchants and blending them into the global marketplace. The women are producing goods which are being bought and sold not only in Mexico, but also in the United States and the rest of the world.

In the central valleys of Oaxaca, the Zapotec villages often have a specific craft associated with them. In those villages, most of the people of that village will be makers of that particular product. In San Bartolo Coyotepec, they are known for their black pottery. San Martín Tilcajete people are known for their carved and brightly painted wooden figures.

Although there are very specifically defined gender roles regarding industrial production, it varies by city and by technique. In larger cities, such as Oaxaca, where the industry is based around more expensive goods, such as automotive production or electronics manufacturing, men typically command factories and are engineers and directors, while women are usually in the lower positions of line workers and assistants. In villages such as San Bartolo Yautepec, where back-strap weaving is done, the weaving is done by women. These are usually lightweight fabrics used for table runners, purses and smaller items. In Teotitlán, Santa Ana del Valle and Villa Díaz Ordaz for example, rug weaving on floor looms is done primarily by men, though women also weave rugs. Women&#x27;s contributions are becoming greater and many women have a certain degree of independence and autonomy through their income from weaving. But feeding, clothing and taking care of the family is usually their primary responsibility. In Mitla, fly shuttle weaving, of light-weight, but large-scale, fabrics are also more often done by men than by women, probably because of the physical effort required.

<doc id="147247" wikidata="Q207089" url="?curid=147247" title="Republic P-47 Thunderbolt">
<text>The Republic P-47 Thunderbolt is a World War II-era fighter aircraft produced by the American company Republic Aviation from 1941 through 1945. It was a successful high-altitude fighter, and it also served as the foremost American fighter-bomber in the ground-attack role. Its primary armament was eight .50-caliber machine guns, and it could carry 5-inch rockets or a bomb load of . When fully loaded, the P-47 weighed up to 8 tons, making it one of the heaviest fighters of the war.

The Thunderbolt was effective as a short- to medium-range escort fighter in high-altitude air-to-air combat and ground attack in both the European and Pacific theaters. The P-47 was designed around the powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp 18-cylinder radial engine, which also powered two U.S. Navy/U.S. Marine Corps fighters, the Grumman F6F Hellcat and the Vought F4U Corsair. An advanced turbosupercharger system ensured the aircraft&#x27;s eventual dominance at high altitudes, while also influencing its size and design.

The P-47 was one of the main United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) fighters of World War II. It also served with other Allied air forces, including those of France, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, as well as Allied Mexican and Brazilian squadrons.

The armored cockpit was relatively roomy and comfortable and the bubble canopy introduced on the P-47D offered good visibility. Nicknamed the &quot;Jug&quot; owing to its appearance if stood on its nose, the P-47 was noted for its firepower and its ability to resist battle damage and remain airworthy. A present-day U.S. ground-attack aircraft, the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II, takes its name from the P-47.

==Development==

The P-47 Thunderbolt was designed by Alexander Kartveli, a man of Georgian descent. It was to replace the Seversky P-35 developed earlier by a Russian immigrant named Alexander P. de Seversky. Both had fled from their homeland, Tbilisi, Georgia, to escape the Bolsheviks. In 1939, Republic Aviation designed the AP-4 demonstrator powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 radial engine with a belly-mounted turbocharger. A small number of Republic P-43 Lancers were built, but Republic had been working on an improved P-44 Rocket with a more powerful engine, as well as on the AP-10 fighter design. The latter was a lightweight aircraft powered by the Allison V-1710 liquid-cooled V-12 engine and armed with two .50 in (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns mounted in the nose and four .30 in (7.62 mm) M1919 Browning machine guns mounted in the wings. The United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) backed the project and gave it the designation XP-47.

In the spring of 1940, Republic and the USAAC concluded that the XP-44 and the XP-47 were inferior to &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; fighters. Republic tried to improve the design, proposing the XP-47A, but this failed. Kartveli then designed a much larger fighter, which was offered to the USAAC in June 1940, which ordered a prototype in September as the XP-47B. The XP-47A, which had little in common with the new design, was abandoned. The XP-47B was of all-metal construction (except for the fabric-covered tail control surfaces) with elliptical wings, with a straight leading edge that was slightly swept back. The air-conditioned cockpit was roomy, and the pilot&#x27;s seat was comfortable—&quot;like a lounge chair&quot;, as one pilot later put it. The canopy doors hinged upward. Main and auxiliary self-sealing fuel tanks were placed under the cockpit, giving a total fuel capacity of .

Power came from a Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp two-row, 18-cylinder radial engine producing — the same engine that powered the prototype Vought XF4U-1 fighter to just over in October 1940—with the Double Wasp on the XP-47B turning a four-bladed Curtiss Electric constant-speed propeller of in diameter. The loss of the AP-4 prototype to an engine fire ended Kartveli&#x27;s experiments with tight-fitting cowlings, so the engine was placed in a broad cowling that opened at the front in a &quot;horse collar&quot;-shaped ellipse. The cowling admitted cooling air for the engine, left and right oil coolers, and the turbosupercharger intercooler system. The engine exhaust gases were routed into a pair of wastegate-equipped pipes that ran along each side of the cockpit to drive the turbosupercharger turbine at the bottom of the fuselage, about halfway between cockpit and tail. At full power, the pipes glowed red at their forward ends and the turbine spun at 21,300 rpm. The complicated turbosupercharger system with its ductwork gave the XP-47B a deep fuselage, and the wings had to be mounted in a relatively high position. This was difficult, since long-legged main landing gear struts were needed to provide ground clearance for the enormous propeller. To reduce the size and weight of the undercarriage struts, and so wing-mounted machine guns could be fitted, each strut was fitted with a mechanism by which it telescoped out while it extended.

The XP-47B was very heavy compared with contemporary single-engined fighters, with an empty weight of , or 65% more than the YP-43. Kartveli said, &quot;It will be a dinosaur, but it will be a dinosaur with good proportions&quot;. The armament was eight .50-caliber (12.7 mm) &quot;light-barrel&quot; Browning AN/M2 machine guns, four in each wing. The guns were staggered to allow feeding from side-by-side ammunition boxes, each with 350 rounds. All eight guns gave the fighter a combined rate of fire around 100 rounds per second.

The XP-47B first flew on 6 May 1941 with Lowry P. Brabham at the controls. Although minor problems arose, such as some cockpit smoke that turned out to be due to an oil drip, the aircraft proved impressive in its early trials. It was lost in an accident on 8 August 1942, but before that mishap, the prototype had achieved a level speed of at altitude and had demonstrated a climb from sea level to in five minutes.

Though the XP-47B had its share of shakedown troubles, the newly reorganized United States Army Air Forces placed an order for 171 production aircraft, the first being delivered in December 1941.

==Operational history==

===US service===
By the end of 1942, P-47Cs were sent to England for combat operations. The initial Thunderbolt flyers, 56th Fighter Group, were sent overseas to join the 8th Air Force. As the P-47 Thunderbolt worked up to operational status, it gained a nickname: &quot;Jug&quot; (because its profile was similar to that of a common milk jug of the time). Two fighter groups already stationed in England began introducing the Jugs in January 1943 - the Spitfire-flying 4th Fighter Group, a unit built around a core of experienced American pilots who had flown in the RAF Eagle Squadrons prior to the US entry in the war; and the 78th Fighter Group, formerly flying P-38 Lightnings.
Beginning in January 1943, Thunderbolt fighters were sent to the joint Army Air Forces – civilian Millville Airport in Millville, New Jersey, to train civilian and military pilots.

The first P-47 combat mission took place 10 March 1943 when the 4th FG took their aircraft on a fighter sweep over France. The mission was a failure due to radio malfunctions. All P-47s were refitted with British radios, and missions resumed 8 April. The first P-47 air combat took place 15 April with Major Don Blakeslee of the 4th FG scoring the Thunderbolt&#x27;s first air victory (against a Focke-Wulf Fw 190).

By mid-1943, the Jug was also in service with the 12th Air Force in Italy and against the Japanese in the Pacific, with the 348th Fighter Group flying missions out of Port Moresby, New Guinea. By 1944, the Thunderbolt was in combat with the USAAF in all its operational theaters except Alaska.

&quot;Luftwaffe&quot; ace Heinz Bär said that the P-47 &quot;could absorb an astounding amount of lead [from shooting at it] and had to be handled very carefully&quot;. Although the North American P-51 Mustang replaced the P-47 in the long-range escort role in Europe, the Thunderbolt still ended the war with an aerial kill ratio of 4.6:1 in over 746,000 sorties of all types, at the cost of 3,499 P-47s to all causes in combat. By the end of the war, the 56th FG was the only 8th Air Force unit still flying the P-47, by preference, instead of the P-51. The unit claimed 677-1/2 air victories and 311 ground kills, at the cost of 128 aircraft. Lieutenant Colonel Francis S. Gabreski scored 28 victories, Captain Robert S. Johnson scored 27 aerial victories (with one unconfirmed probable kill leading to some giving his tally as 28), and 56th FG Commanding Officer Colonel Hubert Zemke scored 17.75 kills. Despite being the sole remaining P-47 group in the 8th Air Force, the 56th FG remained its top-scoring group in aerial victories throughout the war.

With increases in fuel capacity as the type was refined, the range of escort missions over Europe steadily increased until the P-47 was able to accompany bombers in raids all the way into Germany. On the way back from the raids, pilots shot up ground targets of opportunity, and also used belly shackles to carry bombs on short-range missions, which led to the realization that the P-47 could perform a dual function on escort missions as a fighter-bomber. Even with its complicated turbosupercharger system, its sturdy airframe and tough radial engine could absorb significant damage and still return home.

The P-47 gradually became the USAAF&#x27;s primary fighter-bomber; by late 1943, early versions of the P-47D carried bombs underneath their bellies, midproduction versions of the P-47D could carry bombs and M8 4.5 in (115 mm) rockets under their wings or from the last version of the P-47D in 1944, High Velocity Aircraft Rockets (HVARs, also known as &quot;Holy Moses&quot;). From D-Day until VE day, Thunderbolt pilots claimed to have destroyed 86,000 railroad cars, 9,000 locomotives, 6,000 armored fighting vehicles, and 68,000 trucks. During Operation Cobra, in the vicinity of Roncey, on 29 July, early in the US break out, the 405th Fighter Group hit a German column trapped between Roncey and St-Denis-le-Vetu by elements of the US 2nd and 3rd Armoured Divisions. The group attacked this column from 3.10pm to 9.40pm. Ground investigations found 66 tanks, 204 vehicles and 11 guns destroyed in this attack. .

===Postwar service===
With the end of World War II, orders for 5,934 were cancelled. The P-47 (redesignated to F-47 after 1947) continued serving with the USAAF through 1947, the USAAF Strategic Air Command from 1946 through 1947, the active-duty United States Air Force (USAF) until 1949, and with the Air National Guard (ANG) until 1953. F-47s served as spotters for rescue aircraft such as the OA-10 Catalina and Boeing B-17H. In 1950, F-47 Thunderbolts were used to suppress the declaration of independence in Puerto Rico by nationalists during the Jayuya Uprising.

The F-47 was not deployed to Korea for the Korean War. The North American F-51 (P-51) Mustang was used by the USAF, mainly in the close air-support role. Since the Mustang was more vulnerable to being shot down, (and many were lost to antiaircraft fire), some World War II P-47 pilots suggested the more durable Thunderbolt should have been sent to Korea in the Mustang&#x27;s place. The F-51D was available in greater numbers, though, in the USAF and ANG inventories. Due to continued postwar service with U.S. military and foreign operators, a number of Thunderbolts have survived to the present day, and a few are still flying. The Cuban Air Force took delivery of 29 ex-USAF airframes and spares. By the late 1950s, the F-47 was considered long obsolete as a fighter, but was well suited for counter-insurgency tasks.

===P-47 in Allied service===

P-47s were operated by several Allied air arms during World War II. The RAF received 240 razorback P-47Ds, which they designated Thunderbolt Mark I, and 590 bubbletop P-47D-25s, designated Thunderbolt Mark IIs. With no need for another high-altitude fighter, the RAF adapted their Thunderbolts for ground attack, a task for which the type was well suited. Once the Thunderbolts were cleared for use in 1944, they were used against the Japanese in Burma by 16 RAF squadrons of the South East Asia Command from India. Operations with army support (operating as &quot;cab ranks&quot; to be called in when needed), attacks on enemy airfields and lines of communication, and escort sorties. They proved devastating in tandem with Spitfires during the Japanese breakout attempt at the Sittang Bend in the final months of the war. The Thunderbolts were armed with three bombs or, in some cases, British &quot;&quot; RP-3 rocket projectiles. Long-range fuel tanks gave five hours of endurance. Thunderbolts flew escort for RAF Liberators in the bombing of Rangoon. Thunderbolts remained in RAF service until October 1946. Postwar RAF Thunderbolts were used in support of the Dutch attempts to reassert control of Batavia. Those squadrons not disbanded outright after the war re-equipped with British-built aircraft such as the Hawker Tempest.

During the Italian campaign, the &quot;1º Grupo de Caça da Força Aérea Brasileira&quot; (Brazilian Air Force 1st Fighter Squadron) flew a total of 48 P-47Ds in combat (of a total of 67 received, 19 of which were backup aircraft). This unit flew a total of 445 missions from November 1944 to May 1945 over northern Italy and Central Europe, with 15 P-47s lost to German flak and five pilots being killed in action. In the early 1980s, this unit was awarded the &quot;Presidential Unit Citation&quot; by the American government in recognition for its achievements in World War II.

From March 1945 to the end of the war in the Pacific—as Mexico had declared war on the Axis on May 22, 1942—the Mexican Escuadrón Aéreo de Pelea 201 (201st Fighter Squadron) operated P-47Ds as part of the U.S. 5th Air Force in the Philippines. In 791 sorties against Japanese forces, the 201st lost no pilots or aircraft to enemy action.

The Free French Air Forces received 446 P-47Ds from 1943. These aircraft saw extensive action in France and Germany and again in the 1950s during the Algerian War of Independence.

After World War II, the Italian Air Force (AMI) received 75 P-47D-25s sent to 5˚ &quot;Stormo&quot;, and 99 to the 51˚. These machines were delivered between 1947 and 1950. However, they were not well liked, as the Italian pilots were used to much lighter aircraft and found the controls too heavy. Nevertheless, the stability, payload, and high speed were appreciated. Most importantly, the P-47 served as an excellent transition platform to heavier jet fighters, including the F-84 Thunderjet, starting in 1953.

The type was provided to many Latin American air forces, some of which operated it into the 1960s. Small numbers of P-47s were also provided to China, Iran, Turkey, and Yugoslavia.

===In Soviet service===
In mid-1943, the Soviet high command showed an interest in the P-47B. Three P-47D-10-REs were ferried to the Soviet Air Forces (VVS) via Alaska in March 1944. Two of them were tested in April–May 1944. Test pilot Aleksey N. Grinchik noted the spacious cockpit with good ventilation and a good all-around view. He found it easy to fly and stable upon take-off and landing, but it showed excessive rolling stability and poor directional stability. Soviet engineers disassembled the third aircraft to examine its construction. They appreciated the high production standards and rational design well-suited to mass production, and the high reliability of the hard-hitting Browning machine guns. With its high service ceiling, the P-47 was superior to fighters operating on the Eastern front, yielding a higher speed above . The Yakovlev Yak-9, Lavochkin La-5FN, Messerschmitt Bf 109G, and Focke-Wulf Fw 190A outperformed the early model P-47 at low and medium altitude, where the P-47 had poor acceleration and performed aerobatics rather reluctantly.

In mid-1944, 200 P-47D-22-REs and P-47D-27-REs were ferried to the USSR via Iraq and Iran. Many were sent to training units. Less than half reached operational units, and they were rarely used in combat. The fighters were assigned to high-altitude air defense over major cities in rear areas.

Unlike their Western counterparts, the VVS made little use of the P-47 as a ground-attack aircraft, depending, instead, on their own widely produced—with 36,183 examples built during the war—special-purpose, armored ground-attack aircraft, the Ilyushin Il-2. At the end of the war, Soviet units held 188 P-47s.

===In German service===
The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; operated at least one captured P-47. In poor weather on 7 November 1943, while flying a P-47D-2-RA on a bomber escort mission, 2nd Lt. William E. Roach of 358th Fighter Squadron, 355th Fighter Group made an emergency landing on a German airfield. Roach was imprisoned at Stalag Luft I. The Thunderbolt was given German markings.

===In Chinese/Taiwanese service===
After World War II, the Chinese Nationalist Air Force received 102 P-47Ds used during the Chinese Civil War. The Chinese Communists captured five P-47Ds from the Chinese Nationalist forces. In 1948, the Chinese Nationalists employed 70 P-47Ds and 42 P-47Ns brought to Taiwan in 1952. P-47s were used extensively in aerial clashes over the Taiwan Strait between Nationalist and Communist aircraft.

==Flying the Thunderbolt==

===Aerial warfare===
Initial response to the P-47 praised its dive speed and high-altitude performance, while criticizing its turning performance and rate of climb (particularly at low to medium altitudes). The turbosupercharger in the P-47 gave the powerplant its maximum power at , and in the thin air above , the Thunderbolt remained fast and nimble compared to other aircraft.

The P-47 first saw action with the 4th Fighter Group, whose pilots were mainly drawn from the three British Eagle Squadrons, who had previously flown the British Spitfire Mark V, a much smaller and much more slender aircraft. At first, they viewed their new fighter with misgivings. It was huge; the British pilots joked that a Thunderbolt pilot could defend himself from a &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; fighter by running around and hiding in the fuselage. Optimized for high-altitude work, the Thunderbolt had more wingspan, a quarter more wing area, about four times the fuselage volume, and nearly twice the weight of a Spitfire V. One Thunderbolt pilot compared it to flying a bathtub around the sky. When his unit (4th Fighter Group) was equipped with Thunderbolts, ace Don Blakeslee said, referring to the P-47&#x27;s vaunted ability to dive on its prey, &quot;It ought to be able to dive. It certainly can&#x27;t climb.&quot; (Blakeslee&#x27;s early-model P-47C had not been fitted with the new paddle blade propeller). The 4th Fighter Group&#x27;s commander hated the P-47, and his prejudices filtered down to the group&#x27;s pilots; the 4th had the fewest kills of any of the first three P-47 squadrons in Europe.

U.S. ace Jim Goodson, who had flown Spitfires with the RAF and flew a P-47 in 1943, at first shared the skepticism of other pilots for their &quot;seven-ton milk bottles&quot;, but Goodson learned to appreciate the P-47&#x27;s potential: There were many U.S. pilots who preferred the P-47 to anything else; they do not agree that the (Fw) 190 held an overall edge against it.
The P-47&#x27;s initial success in combat was primarily due to tactics, using rolls (the P-47 had an excellent roll rate) and energy-saving dive and zoom climbs from high altitude to outmaneuver German fighters. Both the Bf 109 and Fw 190 could, like the Spitfire, out-turn and out-climb the early model P-47s at low to medium altitudes, since these early P-47s had mediocre climb performance due to the lack of paddle-blade propellers. The arrival of the new Curtiss paddle-blade propeller in early 1944 significantly increased climb rate at lower altitudes and came as a surprise to German pilots, who had resorted to steep climbs to evade pursuit by the P-47. Some P-47 pilots claimed to have broken the sound barrier in steep dives, but later research revealed that because of the pressure buildup inside the pitot tube at high speeds, airspeed readings became unpredictably exaggerated. As P-47s were able to out-dive enemy fighter planes attempting to escape by such a maneuver, German pilots gradually learned to avoid diving away from a P-47. Kurt Bühligen, a high-scoring German fighter ace with 112 victories, recalled:
The P-47 was very heavy, too heavy for some maneuvers. We would see it coming from behind, and pull up fast, and the P-47 couldn&#x27;t follow and we came around and got on its tail in this way. 

Other positive attributes included the P-47&#x27;s ruggedness; its radial piston engine had a high tolerance for damage compared to liquid-cooled engines, while its large size meant it could sustain a large amount of damage and still be able to get its pilot back to base. With eight .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns, the P-47 carried more firepower than other single-engined American fighters. P-47 pilots claimed 20 &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighters and four Arado Ar 234 jet bombers in aerial combat.

In the Pacific, Colonel Neel E. Kearby of the Fifth Air Force claimed 22 Japanese aircraft and was awarded the Medal of Honor for an action in which he downed six enemy fighters on a single mission. He was shot down and killed over Wewak in March 1944.

===Ground attack role===

The P-47 proved to be a formidable fighter-bomber due to its good armament, heavy bomb load, and ability to survive enemy fire. The P-47&#x27;s survivability was due in part to its radial piston engine, which unlike comparable liquid-cooled engines, had a high tolerance for damage. The Thunderbolt&#x27;s eight .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns were capable against lightly armored targets, although less so than cannon-armed aircraft of the day. In a ground-attack role, the armor-piercing, armor-piercing incendiary, and armor-piercing incendiary tracer ammunition proved useful in penetrating thin-skinned and lightly armored German vehicles and causing their fuel tanks to explode, as well as occasionally damaging some types of enemy armored fighting vehicles (AFVs).

P-47 pilots frequently carried two bombs, using skip bombing techniques for difficult targets (skipping bombs into railroad tunnels to destroy hidden enemy trains was a favorite tactic). The adoption of the triple-tube M10 rocket launcher with M8 high-explosive rockets (each with an explosive force similar to a 105 mm artillery shell)—much as the RAF&#x27;s Hawker Typhoon gained when first fitted with its own two quartets of underwing RP-3 rockets for the same purposes—significantly increased the P-47&#x27;s ground attack capability. Late in the war, the P-47 was retrofitted with more powerful HVAR rockets.

==In popular culture==

Broadcast radio interviews of several wartime P-47 pilots appear on the CD audiobook &quot;USAAF at War 1942–45&quot;, including an account by Lieutenant J. K. Dowling of ground support operations around Cherbourg in June 1944, and a group of four pilots from the 362nd Fighter Wing (Ninth Air Force) in conversation at their mess in Rouvres, France on 24 December 1944 during the Battle of the Bulge.

&quot;Laughter and Tears&quot;, by Captain George Rarey, a posthumous publication of letters and sketches from a pilot in the 379th Air group flying P-47s based in England.

The Czech composer Bohuslav Martinů, while in residence in the US wrote an orchestral scherzo in 1945 entitled &quot;P-47 Thunderbolt&quot; (H 309) in tribute to the aircraft and its role in World War II.

Other media include &quot;Thunderbolt&quot;, a 1947 color documentary film directed by John Sturges and William Wyler, featuring James Stewart and Lloyd Bridges and narrated by Robert Lowery. The film &quot;Fighter Squadron&quot; (1948) depicts a P-47 Thunderbolt unit.

&quot;Thunderbolts: The Conquest of the Reich&quot;, a 2001 television documentary presented by the History Channel. Director Lawrence Bond depicted the last months of World War II over Germany as told by four P-47 pilots of the 362nd Fighter Group using original, all color 1945 footage. The P-47 Thunderbolt was the subject of an episode of the &quot;World&#x27;s Deadliest Aircraft&quot; series broadcast by the Military Channel.

Lieutenant Colonel Robert Samuel Johnson collaborated with aviation author Martin Caidin to write his autobiographical story of the 56th Fighter Group, &quot;Thunderbolt!,&quot; in 1958. Johnson scored 27 kills in the P-47 while flying with the 56th Fighter Group.

In 2015, it was named the state aircraft of Indiana due to its Evansville roots. It is the namesake of the Evansville Thunderbolts minor league hockey team.

<doc id="147249" wikidata="Q375343" url="?curid=147249" title="Java Data Objects">
<text>Java Data Objects (JDO) is a specification of Java object persistence. One of its features is a transparency of the persistence services to the domain model. JDO persistent objects are ordinary Java programming language classes (POJOs); there is no requirement for them to implement certain interfaces or extend from special classes. JDO 1.0 was developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 12. JDO 2.0 was developed under JSR 243 and was released on May 10, 2006. JDO 2.1 was completed in Feb 2008, developed by the Apache JDO project. JDO 2.2 was released in October 2008. JDO 3.0 was released in April 2010.

Object persistence is defined in the external XML metafiles, which may have vendor-specific extensions. JDO vendors provide developers with &quot;enhancers&quot;, which modify compiled Java class files so they can be transparently persisted. (Note that byte-code enhancement is not mandated by the JDO specification, although it is the commonly used mechanism for implementing the JDO specification&#x27;s requirements.) Currently, JDO vendors offer several options for persistence, e.g. to RDBMS, to OODB, or to files.

JDO enhanced classes are portable across different vendors&#x27; implementation. Once enhanced, a Java class can be used with any vendor&#x27;s JDO product.

JDO is integrated with Java EE in several ways. First of all, the vendor implementation may be provided as a . Secondly, JDO may work in the context of JEE transaction services.

== JDO vs. EJB3 vs. JPA ==
Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0 (EJB3) specification also covered persistence, as had EJB v2 with Entity Beans. There have been standards conflicts between the two standards bodies in terms of pre-eminence. JDO has several commercial implementations.

In the end, persistence has been &quot;broken out&quot; of &quot;EJB3 Core&quot;, and a new standard formed, the Java Persistence API (JPA). JPA uses the codice_1 package, and was first specified in a separate document within the EJB3 spec JSR 220, but was later moved to its own spec JSR 317. Significantly, codice_1 will not require an EJB container, and thus will work within a Java SE environment as well, as JDO always has. JPA, however, is an object-relational mapping (ORM) standard, while JDO is both an object-relational mapping standard and a transparent object persistence standard. JDO, from an API point of view, is agnostic to the technology of the underlying datastore, whereas JPA is targeted to RDBMS datastores (although there are several JPA providers that support access to non-relational datastores through the JPA API, such as DataNucleus and ObjectDB).

Leading JDO commercial implementations and open source projects also offer a JPA API implementation as an alternative access to their underlying persistence engines, formerly exposed solely via JDO in the original products. There are many open source implementations of JDO.

== New Features in JDO Version 2 Not Found In Version 1 ==

* Disconnected object graphs concept
* Standardized ORM mapping descriptors (for ORM-based JDO implementations)
* JDOQL Enhancements (Single String Form; more String, Map &amp; Math methods support mandated)
* Get e.g. a from codice_3
* More: Named Queries (pm.newNamedQuery), FetchPlan, Sequence, Delete by Query, multiple User Objects on PM

<text>In calculus, and more generally in mathematical analysis, integration by parts or partial integration is a process that finds the integral of a product of functions in terms of the integral of the product of their derivative and antiderivative. It is frequently used to transform the antiderivative of a product of functions into an antiderivative for which a solution can be more easily found. The rule can be thought of as an integral version of the product rule of differentiation; it is indeed derived using the product rule.

The integration by parts formula states:
formula_1

Or, letting formula_2 and formula_3 while formula_4 and formula_5 the formula can be written more compactly:
formula_6

The former expression is written as a definite integral and the latter is written as an indefinite integral. Applying the appropriate limits to the latter expression should yield the former, but the latter is not necessarily equivalent to the former.

Mathematician Brook Taylor discovered integration by parts, first publishing the idea in 1715. More general formulations of integration by parts exist for the Riemann–Stieltjes and Lebesgue–Stieltjes integrals. The discrete analogue for sequences is called summation by parts.

==Theorem==

===Product of two functions===
The theorem can be derived as follows. For two continuously differentiable functions formula_7 and formula_8, the product rule states:

formula_9

Integrating both sides with respect to formula_10,

formula_11

and noting that an indefinite integral is an antiderivative gives

formula_12

where we neglect writing the constant of integration. This yields the formula for integration by parts:

formula_13

or in terms of the differentials formula_14, formula_15

formula_16

This is to be understood as an equality of functions with an unspecified constant added to each side. Taking the difference of each side between two values formula_17 and formula_18 and applying the fundamental theorem of calculus gives the definite integral version:
formula_19
The original integral formula_20 contains the derivative ; to apply the theorem, one must find , the antiderivative of , then evaluate the resulting integral formula_21

===Validity for less smooth functions===
It is not necessary for formula_22 and formula_23 to be continuously differentiable. Integration by parts works if formula_22 is absolutely continuous and the function designated formula_25 is Lebesgue integrable (but not necessarily continuous). (If formula_25 has a point of discontinuity then its antiderivative formula_23 may not have a derivative at that point.)

If the interval of integration is not compact, then it is not necessary for formula_22 to be absolutely continuous in the whole interval or for formula_25 to be Lebesgue integrable in the interval, as a couple of examples (in which formula_22 and formula_23 are continuous and continuously differentiable) will show. For instance, if

formula_32

formula_22 is not absolutely continuous on the interval , but nevertheless:

formula_34

so long as formula_35 is taken to mean the limit of formula_36 as formula_37 and so long as the two terms on the right-hand side are finite. This is only true if we choose formula_38 Similarly, if

formula_39

formula_25 is not Lebesgue integrable on the interval , but nevertheless

formula_34
with the same interpretation.

One can also easily come up with similar examples in which formula_22 and formula_23 are &quot;not&quot; continuously differentiable.

Further, if formula_44 is a function of bounded variation on the segment formula_45 and formula_46 is differentiable on formula_45 then

formula_48

where formula_49 denotes the signed measure corresponding to the function of bounded variation formula_50, and functions formula_51 are extensions of formula_52 to formula_53 which are respectively of bounded variation and differentiable.

===Product of many functions===

Integrating the product rule for three multiplied functions, formula_7, formula_8, formula_56, gives a similar result:

formula_57

In general, for formula_58 factors

formula_59

which leads to

formula_60

==Visualization==

Consider a parametric curve formula_61. Assuming that the curve is locally one-to-one and integrable, we can define
formula_62

The area of the blue region is

formula_63

Similarly, the area of the red region is
formula_64

The total area &quot;A&quot;1 + &quot;A&quot;2 is equal to the area of the bigger rectangle, &quot;x&quot;2&quot;y&quot;2, minus the area of the smaller one, &quot;x&quot;1&quot;y&quot;1:

formula_65
Or, in terms of &quot;t&quot;,
formula_66
Or, in terms of indefinite integrals, this can be written as
formula_67
Rearranging:
formula_68
Thus integration by parts may be thought of as deriving the area of the blue region from the area of rectangles and that of the red region.

This visualization also explains why integration by parts may help find the integral of an inverse function &quot;f&quot;−1(&quot;x&quot;) when the integral of the function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is known. Indeed, the functions &quot;x&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) and &quot;y&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) are inverses, and the integral ∫ &quot;x&quot; &quot;dy&quot; may be calculated as above from knowing the integral ∫ &quot;y&quot; &quot;dx&quot;. In particular, this explains use of integration by parts to integrate logarithm and inverse trigonometric functions. In fact, if formula_69 is a differentiable one-to-one function on an interval, then integration by parts can be used to derive a formula for the integral of formula_70 in terms of the integral of formula_69. This is demonstrated in the article, Integral of inverse functions.

==Applications==

===Finding antiderivatives===
Integration by parts is a heuristic rather than a purely mechanical process for solving integrals; given a single function to integrate, the typical strategy is to carefully separate this single function into a product of two functions &quot;u&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)&quot;v&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) such that the residual integral from the integration by parts formula is easier to evaluate than the single function. The following form is useful in illustrating the best strategy to take:

formula_72

On the right-hand side, &quot;u&quot; is differentiated and &quot;v&quot; is integrated; consequently it is useful to choose &quot;u&quot; as a function that simplifies when differentiated, or to choose &quot;v&quot; as a function that simplifies when integrated. As a simple example, consider:

formula_73

Since the derivative of ln(&quot;x&quot;) is , one makes (ln(&quot;x&quot;)) part &quot;u&quot;; since the antiderivative of is −, one makes part &quot;v&quot;. The formula now yields:

formula_74

The antiderivative of − can be found with the power rule and is .

Alternatively, one may choose &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; such that the product &quot;u&quot;′ (∫&quot;v&quot; &quot;dx&quot;) simplifies due to cancellation. For example, suppose one wishes to integrate:

formula_75

If we choose &quot;u&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = ln(|sin(&quot;x&quot;)|) and &quot;v&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = sec2x, then &quot;u&quot; differentiates to formula_76 using the chain rule and &quot;v&quot; integrates to tan &quot;x&quot;; so the formula gives:

formula_77

The integrand simplifies to 1, so the antiderivative is &quot;x&quot;. Finding a simplifying combination frequently involves experimentation.

In some applications, it may not be necessary to ensure that the integral produced by integration by parts has a simple form; for example, in numerical analysis, it may suffice that it has small magnitude and so contributes only a small error term. Some other special techniques are demonstrated in the examples below.

====Polynomials and trigonometric functions====

In order to calculate

formula_78

let:
formula_79

then:

formula_80

where &quot;C&quot; is a constant of integration.

For higher powers of formula_10 in the form

formula_82

repeatedly using integration by parts can evaluate integrals such as these; each application of the theorem lowers the power of formula_10 by one.

====Exponentials and trigonometric functions====

An example commonly used to examine the workings of integration by parts is

formula_84

Here, integration by parts is performed twice. First let

formula_85

then:

formula_86

Now, to evaluate the remaining integral, we use integration by parts again, with:

formula_87

Then:

formula_88

Putting these together,

formula_89

The same integral shows up on both sides of this equation. The integral can simply be added to both sides to get

formula_90

which rearranges to

formula_91

where again formula_92 (and formula_93) is a constant of integration.

A similar method is used to find the integral of secant cubed.

====Functions multiplied by unity====

Two other well-known examples are when integration by parts is applied to a function expressed as a product of 1 and itself. This works if the derivative of the function is known, and the integral of this derivative times formula_10 is also known.

The first example is formula_95. We write this as:

formula_96

Let:

formula_97
formula_98

then:

formula_99

where formula_92 is the constant of integration.

The second example is the inverse tangent function formula_101:

formula_102

Rewrite this as

formula_103

Now let:

formula_104

formula_98

then

formula_106

using a combination of the inverse chain rule method and the natural logarithm integral condition.

====LIATE rule====
The LIATE rule is a rule of thumb for integration by parts. It involves choosing as &quot;u&quot; the function that comes first in the following list:
* L – logarithmic functions: formula_107 etc.
* I – inverse trigonometric functions (including hyperbolic analogues): formula_108 etc.
* A – algebraic functions (such as polynomials): formula_109 etc.
* T – trigonometric functions (including hyperbolic analogues): formula_110 etc.
* E – exponential functions: formula_111 etc.

The function which is to be &quot;dv&quot; is whichever comes last in the list. The reason is that functions lower on the list generally have simpler antiderivatives than the functions above them. The rule is sometimes written as &quot;DETAIL&quot;, where &quot;D&quot; stands for &quot;dv&quot; and the top of the list is the function chosen to be &quot;dv&quot;. An alternative to this rule is the ILATE rule, where inverse trigonometric functions come before logarithmic functions.

To demonstrate the LIATE rule, consider the integral

formula_112

Following the LIATE rule, &quot;u&quot; = &quot;x&quot;, and &quot;dv&quot; = cos(&quot;x&quot;) &quot;dx&quot;, hence &quot;du&quot; = &quot;dx&quot;, and &quot;v&quot; = sin(&quot;x&quot;), which makes the integral become
formula_113
which equals
formula_114

In general, one tries to choose &quot;u&quot; and &quot;dv&quot; such that &quot;du&quot; is simpler than &quot;u&quot; and &quot;dv&quot; is easy to integrate. If instead cos(&quot;x&quot;) was chosen as &quot;u&quot;, and &quot;x dx&quot; as &quot;dv&quot;, we would have the integral

formula_115

which, after recursive application of the integration by parts formula, would clearly result in an infinite recursion and lead nowhere.

Although a useful rule of thumb, there are exceptions to the LIATE rule. A common alternative is to consider the rules in the &quot;ILATE&quot; order instead. Also, in some cases, polynomial terms need to be split in non-trivial ways. For example, to integrate

formula_116

one would set

formula_117

so that

formula_118

Then

formula_119

Finally, this results in
formula_120

Integration by parts is often used as a tool to prove theorems in mathematical analysis.

=== Wallis product ===
The Wallis infinite product for formula_121

formula_122

may be derived using integration by parts.

===Gamma function identity===

The gamma function is an example of a special function, defined as an improper integral for formula_123. Integration by parts illustrates it to be an extension of the factorial function:

formula_124

Since

formula_125

when formula_126 is a natural number, that is, formula_127, applying this formula repeatedly gives the factorial: formula_128

===Use in harmonic analysis===

Integration by parts is often used in harmonic analysis, particularly Fourier analysis, to show that quickly oscillating integrals with sufficiently smooth integrands decay quickly. The most common example of this is its use in showing that the decay of function&#x27;s Fourier transform depends on the smoothness of that function, as described below.

====Fourier transform of derivative====

If formula_69 is a formula_130-times continuously differentiable function and all derivatives up to the formula_130th one decay to zero at infinity, then its Fourier transform satisfies

formula_132

where formula_133 is the formula_130th derivative of formula_69. (The exact constant on the right depends on the convention of the Fourier transform used.) This is proved by noting that

formula_136

so using integration by parts on the Fourier transform of the derivative we get

formula_137

Applying this inductively gives the result for general formula_130. A similar method can be used to find the Laplace transform of a derivative of a function.

====Decay of Fourier transform====

The above result tells us about the decay of the Fourier transform, since it follows that if formula_69 and formula_133 are integrable then

formula_141

In other words, if formula_69 satisfies these conditions then its Fourier transform decays at infinity at least as quickly as . In particular, if formula_143 then the Fourier transform is integrable.

The proof uses the fact, which is immediate from the definition of the Fourier transform, that

formula_144

Using the same idea on the equality stated at the start of this subsection gives

formula_145

Summing these two inequalities and then dividing by gives the stated inequality.

===Use in operator theory===

One use of integration by parts in operator theory is that it shows that the (where ∆ is the Laplace operator) is a positive operator on formula_146 (see &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot; space). If formula_69 is smooth and compactly supported then, using integration by parts, we have

formula_148

===Other applications===

* Determining boundary conditions in Sturm–Liouville theory
* Deriving the Euler–Lagrange equation in the calculus of variations

==Repeated integration by parts==

Considering a second derivative of formula_23 in the integral on the LHS of the formula for partial integration suggests a repeated application to the integral on the RHS:
formula_150

Extending this concept of repeated partial integration to derivatives of degree leads to
formula_151

This concept may be useful when the successive integrals of formula_152 are readily available (e.g., plain exponentials or sine and cosine, as in Laplace or Fourier transforms), and when the th derivative of formula_22 vanishes (e.g., as a polynomial function with degree formula_154). The latter condition stops the repeating of partial integration, because the RHS-integral vanishes.

In the course of the above repetition of partial integrations the integrals 
formula_155 and formula_156 and formula_157
get related. This may be interpreted as arbitrarily &quot;shifting&quot; derivatives between formula_23 and formula_22 within the integrand, and proves useful, too (see Rodrigues&#x27; formula).

===Tabular integration by parts===
The essential process of the above formula can be summarized in a table; the resulting method is called &quot;tabular integration&quot; and was featured in the film &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; (1988).

For example, consider the integral

formula_160 and take formula_161

Begin to list in column A the function formula_162 and its subsequent derivatives formula_163 until zero is reached. Then list in column B the function formula_164 and its subsequent integrals formula_165 until the size of column B is the same as that of column A. The result is as follows:

The product of the entries in of columns A and B together with the respective sign give the relevant integrals in in the course of repeated integration by parts. yields the original integral. For the complete result in the must be added to all the previous products () of the of column A and the of column B (i.e., multiply the 1st entry of column A with the 2nd entry of column B, the 2nd entry of column A with the 3rd entry of column B, etc. ...) with the given This process comes to a natural halt, when the product, which yields the integral, is zero ( in the example). The complete result is the following (with the alternating signs in each term):

formula_166

This yields

formula_167

The repeated partial integration also turns out useful, when in the course of respectively differentiating and integrating the functions formula_163 and formula_165 their product results in a multiple of the original integrand. In this case the repetition may also be terminated with this index This can happen, expectably, with exponentials and trigonometric functions. As an example consider

formula_170

In this case the product of the terms in columns A and B with the appropriate sign for index yields the negative of the original integrand (compare 

formula_171

Observing that the integral on the RHS can have its own constant of integration formula_172, and bringing the abstract integral to the other side, gives:

formula_173

and finally:

formula_174

where formula_175.

==Higher dimensions==
Integration by parts can be extended to functions of several variables by applying a version of the fundamental theorem of calculus to an appropriate product rule. There are several such pairings possible in multivariate calculus, involving a scalar-valued function &quot;u&quot; and vector-valued function (vector field) V. 

The product rule for divergence states:

formula_176

Suppose formula_177 is an open bounded subset of formula_178 with a piecewise smooth boundary formula_179. Integrating over formula_177 with respect to the standard volume form formula_181, and applying the divergence theorem, gives:

formula_182

where formula_183 is the outward unit normal vector to the boundary, integrated with respect to its standard Riemannian volume form formula_184. Rearranging gives:

formula_185

or in other words
formula_186
The regularity requirements of the theorem can be relaxed. For instance, the boundary formula_187 need only be Lipschitz continuous, and the functions &quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot; need only lie in the Sobolev space formula_188.

=== Green&#x27;s first identity ===
Consider the continuously differentiable vector fields formula_189 and formula_190, where formula_191 is the &quot;i&quot;-th standard basis vector for formula_192. Now apply the above integration by parts to each formula_193 times the vector field formula_194:

formula_195

Summing over &quot;i&quot; gives a new integration by parts formula:

formula_196

The case formula_197, where formula_198, is known as the first of Green&#x27;s identities:

formula_199

<text>The Mexican peso (symbol: $; currency code: MXN; also abbreviated Mex$ to distinguish it from other peso-denominated currencies; referred to as the peso, Mexican peso, or colloquially varo) is the official currency of Mexico. The peso was first introduced in 1863, replacing the old Spanish colonial real. The Mexican peso is subdivided into 100 &quot;centavos&quot;, represented by &quot;¢&quot;. Mexican banknotes are issued by the Bank of Mexico in various denominations and feature vibrant colors and imagery representing Mexican culture and history. Modern peso and dollar currencies have a common origin in the 16th–19th century Spanish dollar, most continuing to use its sign, &quot;$&quot;.

The current ISO 4217 code for the peso is &quot;MXN&quot;; the &quot;N&quot; refers to the &quot;new peso&quot;. Prior to the 1993 revaluation, the code &quot;MXP&quot; was used. The Mexican peso is the 16th most traded currency in the world, the third most traded currency from the Americas (after the United States dollar and Canadian dollar), and the most traded currency from Latin America. , the peso&#x27;s exchange rate was $21.16 per euro, $20.62 per U.S. dollar, and $14.28 per Canadian dollar.

==History==

===Etymology===

The name was first used in reference to (&#x27;gold weights&#x27;) or (&#x27;silver weights&#x27;). The Spanish word means “weight”. (Compare the British pound sterling.) Other countries that use the term for the currency include: Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, the Philippines, and Uruguay.

===Precursor===

The currency system in use in Spanish America from the 16th to 19th centuries consisted of silver &quot;reales&quot;, weight 3.433 grams and fineness = 93.1%, as well as gold escudos, weight 3.383 g and fineness = 91.7%. By the 19th century the silver real weighed 3.383 g, fineness = 90.3%, while the gold escudo&#x27;s fineness was reduced to 21 karats or , or 87.5% fine.

15 or 16 silver &quot;reales&quot; were worth a gold &quot;escudo&quot;, and eight-real coins of 24.44 g fine silver were widely called &quot;pesos&quot; in Spanish America and &quot;dollars&quot; in Britain and its American colonies. These pesos or dollars were minted from the rich silver mine outputs of modern-day Mexico and Bolivia and exported in large quantities to Europe and Asia. These pesos served as a global silver standard reserve currency until the start of the 20th century, and became the model for the various pesos of Spanish America as well as (among others) the United States dollar, Chinese yuan and the Japanese yen. Mexican silver pesos of original cap-and-ray design were legal tender in the United States until 1857 and in China until 1935.

===Origin===
The first Mexican mint to produce pesos was established in 1535.

While the United States divided their dollar into 100 cents early on from 1793, post-independence Mexico retained the peso of 8 reales until 1863 when the Second Mexican Empire under Emperor Maximillan commenced the minting of pesos divided into 100 centavos. The restored Mexican republic under Benito Juárez and Porfirio Díaz continued the minting of centavo coins in base metal or silver, as well as gold coins in pesos, but it had to revert the silver 1-peso coin to the old eight reales &quot;cap-and-ray design&quot; from 1873 to 1897 after East Asian merchants rejected or discounted the newly designed peso coins.

The post-independence silver peso contained 27.07 grams of 90.3% fine silver (24.44 g fine) while the gold peso or half escudo contained 1.6915 grams of 87.5% fine gold (1.48 g fine). After most of Europe switched to the gold standard in the 1870s the gold peso substantially rose in value against the silver peso, until it became 2 silver pesos to a gold peso or a gold peso dollar by 1900. In 1905 the peso was solely defined as 0.75 g fine gold.

From 1918 onward the weight and fineness of all the silver coins declined, until 1979, when the last silver 100-peso coins were minted. The U.S. dollar was worth 2.00 silver pesos from 1905 to 1929, rising afterward until it stabilized at 12.50 pesos from 1954 to 1976.

=== Reformation ===
Throughout most of the 20th century, the Mexican peso remained one of the more stable currencies in Latin America, since the economy did not experience periods of hyperinflation common to other countries in the region.

====Devaluations in 1976 and 1982====
The U.S. dollar leapt from 12.50 to 19.40 pesos in 1976. After the oil crisis of the late 1970s, Mexico defaulted on its external debt in 1982, causing severe capital flight and several years of inflation and devaluation. The dollar again rose from 23 to 150 pesos that year, causing any company with loans in USD and contracts in MXP to have their financial position weakened by the devaluation, the result becoming high unemployment and pressure on remaining employees to pick up the increased workloads and putting strain on economic hardships. Government attempts to fix the economy with an inward-looking industrialization strategy were only sustainable with severe economic imbalances that needed large inward capital flows that could not be maintained, and an abrupt process of stabilization and adjustment followed that saw a recession in 1983, stabilizing only in the early 1990s at above 3,000 MXP/USD when a government economic strategy called the &quot;Stability and Economic Growth Pact&quot; &quot;(Pacto de estabilidad y crecimiento económico, PECE)&quot; was adopted under President Carlos Salinas.

====New peso, 1993====
On January 1, 1993, the Bank of Mexico introduced a new currency, the (&quot;new peso&quot;, or MXN), written &quot;N$&quot; followed by the numerical amount. One new peso, or N$1.00, was equal to 1,000 of the obsolete MXP pesos.

====New peso notes and coins====

The transition was done with minimal confusion by issuing the Series B &quot;nuevo peso&quot; banknotes in N$10, $20, $50, and $100 denominations with designs nearly identical to the corresponding banknote in the preceding Series A, which were labelled in old pesos (MXP $10,000, $20,000, $50,000, and $100,000, respectively); for Series B, the equivalent nuevo peso face value was of the old peso face value for Series A. For example, the Series A old peso MXP$20,000 and the Series B nuevo peso MXN$20 banknotes share the same design, aside from the updated face value. Old and new pesos circulated simultaneously between 1993 and 1995, but old peso Series A banknotes were gradually retired at this time, and newly designed Series C &quot;nuevo peso&quot; banknotes commenced in 1994. From January 1, 1996, the &quot;nuevo peso&quot; was simply renamed to &quot;peso&quot;, and new Series D banknotes were issued identical to Series C except for the word &quot;nuevo&quot; dropped. The ISO 4217 code remained unchanged as MXN. Series A and AA banknotes were demonetized and no longer legal tender as of January 1, 1996. Although they remain legal tender, Series B, C, D, and D1 banknotes are in the process of being withdrawn from circulation; in addition, the MXN$1000 Series F banknote is being withdrawn. The most commonly circulated banknotes in Mexico are MXN$20 and above in Series F and G.

Similarly, Series B coins in nuevo peso denominations were circulated starting from 1993 and Series A and AA coins were demonetized starting from November 15, 1995. Unlike the notes, Series B coins differed in size and design from the Series A coins. Series C coins (which dropped the &quot;N$&quot; prefix on the MXN$1, N$5, N$10, N$20, and N$50 coins) were circulated starting in 1996 following the withdrawal of Series A and AA coins. Series B and C coins in uncommon denominations (10-centavo and MXN$20 and greater) are gradually being withdrawn from circulation. Although they remain legal tender, they are set aside when they arrive at commercial banks. The most commonly circulated coins in Mexico are MXN$10 and below in Series C and D.

====Economic effects====
The government&#x27;s operational balances had been predicted to remain stable as the country was operating in a surplus between 1990 and 1994. This crisis was seen as the fault of the Mexican government in its signing of NAFTA at the beginning of 1994. The volatility of MXN increased after the ratification of NAFTA, when the annualized standard deviations seem to be highest post-1994, especially in terms of USD, compared to the United States, which experienced the lowest annualized standard deviation during that same period. Still, several contemporary economists of the time noted the unexpected shocks to the economy during 1994, which exacerbated the situation, starting with the assassination of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, causing a ripple effect on the exchange rate and interest rates that resulted in increased capital leaving the country. The result was the devaluation of MXN because of a domestic recession and an avalanche of investor withdrawals due to concern about the government&#x27;s inability to remain liquid in its international debt repayments. The international outlook, particularly in Wall Street, on the MXN peso crisis was affected by the lack of information on Mexico&#x27;s financial reserves from the Banco de Mexico, which only released information on Mexico&#x27;s reserves three times a year, and the speed of reserve depletion to stabilize the MXN finally resulted in a 15% devaluation by 20 December 1994 and a lack of clear announcements on how the Mexican government was going to handle the crisis. In one day, Banco de Mexico lost USD 4 billion in holdings. The 1994 crisis was more devastating as it was released on a new peso currency. The adoption of MXN in 1993 was meant to balance the economy, and MXP 1000 was the same as MXN 1 upon its 1993 introduction. The MXN crisis let investors in 1995 see a failure of Mexican authorities to act with a lack of preparation to soften the devaluation with a more substantial commitment to maintaining the stability of the exchange rates and questioning further investment in the economy. As the GNP fell by 9.2% in 1995, the panic of the MXN devaluation was significant to Mexican citizens, as the peso depreciated against the USD by 82.9%, while the interest rates rose from 10.5 to 42.7%. The unemployment rates of married male employees increased significantly in urban areas of Mexico, resulting in married women and teenagers from the same households finding employment to prevent the financial collapse of domestic quality of life. Married women with an unemployed husband experienced an employment rate of 33.84% and an unemployment rate of 1.62% compared with unmarried women during this period. The unexpected increase in Mexican immigration, both legal and illegal, in 1995 resulted from the MXN devaluation, pushing Mexican citizens to seek better employment opportunities in the United States. Migration in 1995 was 40% higher than the average level of the rest of the 1990s, with 200,000 to 300,000 more Mexicans immigrating over the border, increasing a labour shock in Mexico that also affected parts of the southwestern United States. There was a significant decline in Mexican household expenditure during this time, where durable and semidurable commodities like televisions, glassware, clothing, and other goods that could be postponed fell between 1996 and 1998, while household food expenditure increased, with lower income households seeing an increase of 3.5% and middle-class households seeing a 2.4% increase, due to the resulting inflation of prices. MXN finally started to see a stabilization between 1996 and 1998, once the Mexican government had enacted banking rescue packages to prevent further collapse, resulting in state control over a large majority of the Mexican financial sector, which led to a renewed growth in the economy that saw more stability by the turn of the millennium.

==== Subsequent exchange rates ====
*Following the revaluation in 1993, the official exchange rate was MXN$3 against the U.S. dollar.
*After the Mexican peso crisis of December 1994, the peso sharply depreciated from MXN$3.4 to MXN$7.2 in 1995.
*It then traded between MXN$8 and MXN$11 from 1998 to 2008, briefly depreciated to MXN$15.56 in March 2009 due to the 2008 global financial crisis, but then settled between MXN$12 and MXN$14 from 2009 to 2014.
*The peso then depreciated from MXN$14.78 in 2014 to MXN$17 in 2015.
*From 2016 to 2019, it traded between MXN$18 and MXN$20.
*Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the peso depreciated to its all-time low of MXN$25 per dollar. 
*From 2020 to 2024, it appreciated by over 30%, becoming one of the best performing currencies in the world. In April 2024, the peso reached a near nine-year high of MXN$16.26 per dollar. This was mostly attributed to the growth of &quot;near-shoring&quot; strategies, growing foreign investment, as well as the strict monetary policy adopted by the Bank of Mexico in attempts to curb inflation following the COVID pandemic and the Russian Invasion of Ukraine.
*Soon after the Mexican general elections in June 2024, the peso sharply depreciated to over MXN$18. It continued to lose value throughout the remainder of the year, and is currently trading above MXN$20.

==Coins==
===Real===
Coins issued from the 16th to 19th centuries under the Spanish American system of &quot;reales&quot; and &quot;escudos&quot; included
* in gold: , 1, 2, 4 and 8 escudos, with 1 escudo ≈ 2 pesos or 16 reales.
* in silver: , 1, 2, 4 and 8 reales, with 1 peso = 8 reales.

Additionally, Mexico issued copper coins denominated in &quot;tlacos&quot; or real ( peso). Post-independence silver coins were of the &quot;cap and ray&quot; design showing a radiant Phrygian cap marked &quot;Libertad&quot; (liberty), which became familiar to East Asian traders. This design ended in 1872 with the minting of &quot;centavo&quot; coins except for the silver 8-reales which was revived as a trade coin from 1873 to 1897.

===Peso, 19th century===


The Second Mexican Empire of 1863-1867 commenced the minting of coins denominated in pesos and centavos, minting the copper 1-centavo, silver 5, 10 and 50 centavos, the silver 1-peso and the gold 20-peso. The last two coins featured the portrait of Emperor Maximilian on the obverse, and the imperial arms of the short-lived empire on the reverse.

The Restored Mexican republic of 1867 continued the minting of coins in pesos and centavos. The copper 1-centavo coin was continued; silver (.9027 fine) coins of 5, 10, 20, 25 and 50 centavos and 1 peso commenced in 1867; and gold coins of 1, , 5, 10 and 20 pesos commenced in 1870. The obverses featured the Mexican &#x27;eagle&#x27; and the legend &quot;Republica Mexicana&quot;. The reverses of the larger coins showed a pair of scales; those of the smaller coins, the denomination.

In 1882, cupro-nickel 1, 2 and 5 centavos coins were issued but they were only minted for two years. Despite the discontinuation of the newly designed silver peso in 1873, in 1898 the denomination on the &quot;cap-and-ray&quot; coin was successfully revised from &quot;8 reales&quot; to &quot;1 peso&quot; without being rejected in China; this continued to be minted as trade coinage until 1909. From 1900 the market value of the gold coins have approximately doubled versus their face values.

===Peso, 20th century===

In 1905 a monetary reform was carried out in which the gold content of the peso was reduced by 49.36% and the silver coins were (with the exception of the 1-peso) reduced to token issues. Bronze 1 and 2 centavos, nickel 5 centavos, silver 10, 20, and 50 centavos and gold 5 and 10 pesos were issued.

In 1910, a new peso coin was issued, known as the &quot;Caballito&quot;. The obverse had the Mexican official coat of arms (an eagle with a snake in its beak, standing on a cactus plant) and the legends &quot;Estados Unidos Mexicanos&quot; and &quot;Un Peso&quot;. The reverse showed a woman riding a horse, her hand lifted high in exhortation holding a torch, and the date. These were minted in .903 fineness silver from 1910 to 1914.

In 1947, a new issue of silver coins was struck, with the 50 centavo and 1 peso in .500 fineness and a new 5-peso coin in .900 fineness. A portrait of José María Morelos appeared on the 1 peso, with Cuauhtémoc appearing on the 5-peso; and this was to remain a feature of the 1 peso coin until its demise. The silver content of this series was 5.4 g to the peso. This was reduced to 4 g in 1950, when .300 fineness 25 and 50 centavo, and 1 peso coins were minted alongside .720 fineness 5 pesos. A new portrait of Morelos appeared on the 1 peso, with Cuauhtemoc now on the 50 centavo and Miguel Hidalgo on the 5 peso coins. No reference was made to the silver content except on the 5 peso coin. During this period 5 peso, and to a lesser extent, 10 peso coins were also used as vehicles for occasional commemorative strikings.
Between 1960 and 1971, new coinage was introduced, consisting of brass 1 and 5 centavos, cupro-nickel 10, 25, and 50 centavos, 1, 5, and 10 pesos, and silver 25 pesos (only issued 1968 and 1972). In 1977, silver 100 pesos were issued for circulation. In 1980, smaller 5 peso coins were introduced alongside 20 pesos and (from 1982) 50-pesos in cupro-nickel. Between 1978 and 1982, the sizes of the coins for 20 centavos and above were reduced. Base metal 100, 200, 500, 1,000, and 5,000 peso coins were introduced between 1984 and 1988.
====Series AA coins====
====Series A coins====
===New peso coins===

As noted above, the (&quot;new peso&quot;) was the result of elevated rates of inflation in Mexico during the 1980s. In 1993, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari stripped three zeros from the peso, creating a parity of 1 new peso for 1,000 of the old ones. The prior coins, issued in the 1970s and 1980s, were designated A-type or AA-type and are no longer valid.

Coins of the new currency (dated 1992) were introduced in 1993 as the B-type or Series B in the following denominations:
* 5 and 10 centavos in stainless steel;
* 20 and 50 centavos in aluminum bronze (switched to stainless steel in 2009);
* Bimetallic 1, 2 and 5 nuevos pesos, with aluminum bronze centers and stainless steel rings; and
* Bimetallic 10, 20 and 50 nuevos pesos, with sterling silver (0.925 fine) centers and aluminum bronze rings.

In 1996, the word was removed from the coins, which are designated as the C-type or Series C. In 1997 regular-issue 10-peso coins were minted with base metal replacing the silver center. In 2000 commemorative 20-peso coins also began to be minted without silver. Though the 50- and 100-peso coins are the only currently circulating coinage in the world to contain any silver, they rarely circulate because their silver content of 1/2 troy ounce have exceeded 100 pesos in value since around 2010.

In 2003 the Banco de México began the gradual launch of a new series of bimetallic $100 coins. These number 32 – one for each of the nation&#x27;s 31 states, plus Mexico City. While the obverse of these coins bears the traditional coat of arms of Mexico, their reverses show the individual coats of arms of the component states. The first states to be celebrated in this fashion were Zacatecas, Yucatán, Veracruz, and Tlaxcala. In circulation, they are extraordinarily rare, but their novelty value offsets the unease most users feel at having such a large amount of money in a single coin. Although the Bank has tried to encourage users to collect full sets of these coins, issuing special display folders for this purpose, the high cost involved has worked against them. Bullion versions of these coins are also available, with the outer ring made of gold instead of aluminum bronze.

The first C1-type coins were issued in 2020; in general, these are commemorative $20 coins. , the coins most commonly encountered in circulation have face values of 50¢, $1, $2, $5 and $10. Commemorative $20 coins are less commonly encountered than $20 notes. The 5¢ coin has been withdrawn from circulation in 2002, while the 10¢ and 20¢ coins have gradually dropped out of circulation due to their low value. Some commodities are priced in multiples of 10¢, but stores may choose to round the total prices to 50¢. There is also a trend for supermarkets to ask customers to round up the total to the nearest 50¢ or 1 peso to automatically donate the difference to charities.

====Series B coins====
====Series C coins====
====Series D coins====
Series D coins, introduced in 2009, replace the prior 10-, 20-, and 50-centavo coins from Series B and C; compared to the prior coinage, the Series D counterparts are made from the punched out cores of the rings used to make the 1-, 2- and 5-peso coins, hence their smaller size and stainless steel composition. This measure is designed to save money and resources in production. The edge of each denomination is different to aid in distinguishing them by touch.

====Special and commemorative coins====
== Banknotes ==

===First ===

The first banknotes issued by the Mexican state were produced in 1823 by Emperor Agustin de Iturbide in denominations of 1, 2 and 10 pesos. Similar issues were made by the republican government later that same year. Ten-pesos notes were also issued by Emperor Maximilian in 1866 but, until the 1920s, banknote production lay entirely in the hands of private banks and local authorities.

In 1920, the Monetary Commission (&quot;Comisión Monetaria&quot;) issued 50-centavos and 1-peso notes whilst the Bank of Mexico (&quot;Banco de México&quot;) issued 2-pesos notes. From 1925, the Bank issued notes for 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 pesos, with 500 and 1000 pesos following in 1931. From 1935, the Bank also began issuing a new series of banknotes (Series AA) including 1-peso notes and, from 1945, 10,000 pesos. These notes were printed by the American Bank Note Company. The banknote of 10,000 pesos was kept in circulation between 1945 and 1956 and was put into circulation again in 1979, being replaced by the 10,000 banknotes that would come into circulation in 1982.

A new series of notes were printed and issued by the Bank of Mexico, starting in 1969 (again as Series AA) with 10 pesos, followed by 5 pesos in 1971, 20 and 50 pesos in 1973, 100 pesos in 1975, 1,000 pesos in 1978, 500 pesos in 1979 and 10,000 pesos in 1982. These were the first notes to be printed directly by Banco de México.

Production of 1-peso notes ceased in 1970, followed by 5 pesos in 1972, 10 and 20 pesos in 1977, 50 pesos in 1984, 100 pesos in 1985, 500 pesos in 1987 and 1,000 pesos in 1988. A new series (Series A) were issued starting from 1980: 5,000-pesos notes were introduced in 1980, followed by 2,000 pesos in 1983, 20,000 pesos in 1985, 50,000 pesos in 1986 and 100,000 pesos in 1991.

==== Series AA ====


==== Series A ====
===Second peso===
====Series B====
In 1993, notes were introduced in the new currency for 10, 20, 50, and 100 nuevos pesos. These notes are designated series B by the Bank of Mexico (&quot;Banco de México&quot;). (This series designation is not the 1 or 2 letter series label printed on the banknotes themselves.) All were printed with the date July 31, 1992. The designs were carried over from the corresponding notes of the old peso.

====Series C====
All Series C notes had brand new designs and were printed with the date December 10, 1993, but they were not issued until October 1994. The word &quot;nuevos&quot; remained, and banknotes in denominations of 200 and 500 nuevos pesos were added. The 500 nuevos pesos note was worth more than US$100 when it was introduced, but its value dropped to almost equal to $100 by the end of 1994.

====Series D====

The next series of banknotes, designated Series D, was introduced in 1996. It is a modified version of Series C with the word &quot;nuevos&quot; dropped, the bank title changed from &quot;El Banco de México&quot; to &quot;Banco de México&quot; and the clause &quot;pagará a la vista al portador&quot; (&quot;Pay at sight to the bearer&quot;) removed. While series D includes the $10 note and is still legal tender, they are no longer printed, are seldom seen, and the coin is more common. $10 notes are rarely found in circulation. There are several printed dates for each denomination.

In 2000, a commemorative series was issued which was based on Series D with the additional text &quot;75 aniversario 1925-2000&quot; under the bank title, which refers to the 75th anniversary of the establishment of the Bank.

Starting from 2001, each denomination in the series was updated. MXN $50, $100, $200, and $500 were the first to be upgraded starting from October 15, 2001; in an effort to combat counterfeiting, these notes were modified with the addition of an iridescent strip. On notes of 100 pesos and greater, the denomination is printed in color-shifting ink in the top right corner. On September 30, 2002, a new $20 note was introduced. The new $20 is printed on longer-lasting polymer plastic rather than paper, and lacks the iridescent strip, but includes a clear window. A new $1000 note was issued on November 15, 2004, which was worth about US$88 upon introduction. The Bank of Mexico refers to these upgraded banknotes during this wave of change as &quot;Series D1&quot;.

On April 5, 2004, the Chamber of Deputies approved an initiative to demand that the Bank of Mexico produce by January 1, 2006, notes and coins that are identifiable by the blind population (estimated at more than 750,000 visually impaired citizens, including 250,000 who are completely blind).
On December 19, 2005, $100, $200, and $500 MXN banknotes in Series D1 were printed, including raised, tactile patterns, meant to make them distinguishable for people with vision incapacities. This system has been questioned and many demand that it be replaced by actual Braille so it can be used by foreign visitors to Mexico not used to these symbols. The Banco de México said will continue issuing the symbol bills. The tactile patterns would be continued for Series F and a fourth pattern was added to the MXN $1,000 note.

====Series F====
In September 2006, the gradual introduction of a new family of banknotes (known as Series F or Type-F) was announced. The 50-peso denomination was launched in November 2006. The 20-peso note was launched in August 2007. The 1,000-peso note was launched in March 2008. The $200 was issued in 2008, and the $100 and $500 notes were released in August 2010. In Series F, the 20 and 50-peso notes are printed on polymer and include clear windows; all denominations include a color-shifting element. For 100-peso notes and greater, a 3D/dynamic thread is included; this thread has holographic images of snails which shift orthogonally relative to the motion of the note, so they will move side to side if the bill is moved up and down, for instance.

Series F included the tactile patterns created by intaglio printing from Series D to distinguish denominations starting at 100 pesos; the 20 and 50-peso notes had the value embossed directly in the clear windows. In addition, Series F denominations are distinguishable by length. Each denomination is longer than the lower by , and a plastic clipboard was distributed free of charge starting in November 2012, which included raised measurement marks and Braille characters to assist the visually impaired.

A revised $50 note, with improved security features, was released on May 6, 2013, and is known as Type F1.

====Commemorative banknotes====
On September 29, 2009, The Bank of Mexico unveiled a set of commemorative banknotes. The 100-peso denomination note commemorates the centennial of the Beginning of the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920). The 200-peso denomination note commemorates the bicentennial of the start of the Mexican War for Independence which began in 1810. There was a printing error in the $100 notes, in the small letters (almost unnoticeable, as they are very small and the same color as the waving lines), near the top right corner, just above the transparent corn, from the side of the &quot;La Revolución contra la dictadura Porfiriana&quot;, it is written: &quot;Sufragio electivo y no reelección&quot; (Elective suffrage and no reelection), this supposed to be a quote to Francisco I. Madero&#x27;s famous phrase, but he said &quot;Sufragio efectivo no reelección&quot; (Valid Suffrage, No Reelection). President Felipe Calderón made a newspaper announcement in which he apologized for this, and said that the notes were going to continue in circulation, and that they would retain their value.

Likewise, a 100-peso banknote that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the enactment of the Constitution of Mexico was unveiled and issued in 2017.

In 2019, the Bank of Mexico issued a new 200-peso banknote of the &quot;Series G&quot; issues, but containing a special overprint referencing the 25th Anniversary of the Bank of Mexico&#x27;s Autonomy from the Federal Government.

====Series G====
In August 2018 a new series of notes started circulating. New anti-counterfeiting measures were implemented. The obverse of the notes portrays important historical eras and individuals. The reverse of the notes portrays the various ecosystems of the country through one of the World Heritage sites of Mexico.

This series was not originally intended to include a $20 note, since it would gradually be replaced by a coin, but a $20 note to commemorate the bicentennial of Mexican independence was issued in September 2021. The 20, 50, and 100-peso notes are produced in polymer, while the other banknotes are printed on paper. Should there be a need, Banco de México will introduce a $2,000 note.

The previous intaglio symbols were dropped from Series G. Instead, the upper left and right edges of the 200, 500, and 1000-peso notes have tactile parallel horizontal lines for identification by touch. 200-peso notes have two lines; 500 and 1000-peso notes have three and four, respectively. The value of the 20, 50, and 100-peso notes are embossed in the clear windows of the corresponding notes, along with a distinctive pattern.

Series G notes also retain the same incremental length increase between denominations from Series F, starting with the MXN $50 note, which is long; exceptions include the commemorative MXN $20 Series G note, which is long, and the planned $2,000 note, which will be longer than the $1,000 note. A new version of the sizing clipboard, compatible with both Series F and G, was issued starting in September 2019.


==Use outside Mexico==
===19th century===
The Spanish dollar and Mexican peso served as a global silver standard reserve currency, recognized all over Europe, Asia and the Americas from the 16th to 20th centuries. They were legal tender in the United States until 1857 and in China until 1935.

The 18th and 19th century Spanish dollar and Mexican peso were widely used in the early United States. On July 6, 1785, the value of the United States dollar was set by decree to approximately match the Spanish dollar. Both were based on the silver content of the coins.
The first U.S. dollar coins were not issued until April 2, 1792, and the peso continued to be officially recognized and used in the United States, along with other foreign coins, until February 21, 1857. In Canada, it remained legal tender, along with other foreign silver coins, until 1854 and continued to circulate beyond that date.

The Mexican peso also served as the model for the Straits dollar (now the Singapore dollar/Brunei dollar), the Malaysian ringgit, the Hong Kong dollar, the Japanese yen, the Korean won, and the Chinese yuan. The Chinese word &quot;yuan&quot; means &quot;round&quot;, describing the Spanish dollars, Mexican &quot;cap-and-ray&quot; pesos and other silver dollars used in China from the 18th to 20th centuries. The Mexican peso was also briefly legal tender in 19th century Siam, where government mints were unable to accommodate a sudden influx of foreign traders, and was exchanged at a rate of three pesos to five Thai baht.

===21st century===
Some establishments in border areas of the United States accept Mexican pesos as currency, such as certain border Walmart stores, certain border gas stations such as Circle K, and the La Bodega supermarkets in San Ysidro on the Tijuana border. In 2007, Pizza Patrón, a chain of pizza restaurants in the southwestern part of the U.S., started to accept the currency, sparking controversy in the United States.

<text>Hofsjökull (Icelandic: &quot;temple glacier&quot;, ) is the third largest ice cap in Iceland after Vatnajökull and Langjökull and covers the largest active central volcano in the country, which has the same name. It is situated in the west of the Highlands of Iceland and north of the mountain range Kerlingarfjöll, between the two largest glaciers of Iceland. 

== Glacier ==
It covers an area of , with the icecap top being , and bottom being at about . There are other summits relating to the underlying volcano with two being at . 
Hofsjökull is the source of several rivers including the Þjórsá, Iceland&#x27;s longest river.

=== Changes ===
While all ice caps in Iceland have been losing volume since 1995, due to high precipitation in 2015 and low ablation during the previous cool summer, the Hofsjökull ice cap increased in mass, the first time in 20 years this had happened. Between 1989 and 2015, even allowing for that last years increase, the icecap had lost about 12% of its 1989 volume which is close to of ice. Hofsjökull has been modelled to lose all its ice in about 200 years from studies using data between 1980 and 2005. Run off into the draining rivers is modelled to increase by about 50% by 2100 before decreasing due to diminishing area of the ice caps. 

== Volcano ==

The subglacial volcano is a central volcano with a caldera. Beyond the central volcano are fissure systems which include to the south the Kerlingarfjöll central volcano.

<doc id="147259" wikidata="Q874586" url="?curid=147259" title="Peyronie's disease">
<text>Peyronie&#x27;s disease is a connective tissue disorder involving the growth of fibrous plaques in the soft tissue of the penis. Specifically, scar tissue forms in the tunica albuginea, the thick sheath of tissue surrounding the corpora cavernosa, causing pain, abnormal curvature, erectile dysfunction, indentation, loss of girth and shortening.
It is estimated to affect 1–20% of men. The condition becomes more common with age.

==Signs and symptoms==

A certain degree of curvature of the penis is considered normal, as many people are born with this benign condition, commonly referred to as congenital curvature. The disease may cause pain; hardened, big, cord-like lesions (scar tissue known as &quot;plaques&quot;); or abnormal curvature of the penis when erect due to chronic inflammation of the &quot;tunica albuginea&quot; (CITA).

Although the popular conception of Peyronie&#x27;s disease is that it always involves curvature of the penis, the scar tissue sometimes causes divots or indentations rather than curvature. The condition may also make sexual intercourse painful and/or difficult, though it is unclear whether some men report satisfactory or unsatisfactory intercourse in spite of the disorder. The disorder is confined to the penis, although a substantial number of men with Peyronie&#x27;s exhibit concurrent connective tissue disorders in the hand, and to a lesser degree, in the feet. About 30 percent of men with Peyronie&#x27;s disease develop fibrosis in other elastic tissues of the body, such as on the hand or foot, including Dupuytren&#x27;s contracture of the hand. An increased incidence in genetically related males suggests a genetic component. It can affect men of any race and age. Macrophallism is a common occurrence in diagnosed cases.

===Psychosocial===
Peyronie&#x27;s disease can also have psychological effects. While most men will continue to be able to have sexual relations, they are likely to experience some degree of erectile dysfunction. It is not uncommon to exhibit depression or withdrawal from their sexual partners.

==Causes==
The underlying cause of Peyronie&#x27;s disease is unknown. Although, it is likely due to a buildup of plaque inside the penis due to repeated mild sexual trauma or injury during sexual intercourse or physical activity.

Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, Dupuytren&#x27;s contracture, plantar fibromatosis, penile trauma, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, genetic predisposition, and European heritage.

==Diagnosis==

A urologist may be able to diagnose the disease and suggest treatment. An ultrasound can provide conclusive evidence of Peyronie&#x27;s disease, ruling out congenital curvature or other disorders.
===Ultrasonography===
On penile ultrasonography, the typical appearance is hyperechoic focal thickening of the tunica albuginea. Due to associated calcifications, the imaging of patients with Peyronie&#x27;s disease shows acoustic shadowing, as illustrated in figures below. Less common findings, attributed to earlier stages of the disease (still mild fibrosis), are hypoechoic lesions with focal thickening of the paracavernous tissues, echoic focal thickening of the tunica without posterior acoustic shadowing, retractile isoechoic lesions with posterior attenuation of the beam, and focal loss of the continuity of the tunica albuginea.

In the Doppler study, increased flow around the plaques can suggest inflammatory activity and the absence of flow can suggest disease stability. Ultrasound is useful for the identification of lesions and to determine their relationship with the neurovascular bundle. Individuals with Peyronie&#x27;s disease can present with erectile dysfunction, often related to venous leakage, due to insufficient drainage at the site of the plaque. Although plaques are more common on the dorsum of the penis, they can also be seen on the ventral face, lateral face, or septum.

==Treatment==

===Medication and supplements===
Many oral treatments have been studied but results so far have been mixed. Some consider the use of nonsurgical approaches to be controversial.

Vitamin E supplementation has been studied for decades, and some success has been reported in older trials; those successes have not been reliably repeated in larger, newer studies. The use of Interferon-alpha-2b in the early stages of the disease has been studied; as of 2007, its efficacy was questionable.

Collagenase clostridium histolyticum is reported to help by breaking down the excess collagen in the penis. It was approved for treatment of Peyronie&#x27;s disease by the FDA in 2013.

The effects of tadalafil in treating the disease have also been studied.

===Physical therapy and devices===
There is moderate evidence that penile traction therapy is a well-tolerated, minimally invasive treatment; there is uncertainty about the optimal duration of stretching per day and per course of treatment, and the treatment course is difficult.

===Surgery===
Surgery such as the &quot;Nesbit operation&quot;, which is named after Reed M. Nesbit (1898–1979), an American urologist at University of Michigan), is considered a last resort and should only be performed by highly skilled urological surgeons knowledgeable in specialized corrective surgical techniques. A penile implant may be appropriate in advanced cases.

== Epidemiology ==
It is estimated to affect 1–20% of men. The condition becomes more common with age. The mean age at onset of disease is 55–60 years although many cases have been recorded in adolescence and early 20&#x27;s.

The overall prevalence of PD is about 1–20% in men. Rates range from 3.2 percent in a community-based survey of 4432 men (mean age of sample 57.4) to 16 percent among 488 men undergoing evaluation for erectile dysfunction (mean age 52.8). The prevalence of PD among the 4432 men in the community based study who responded by self report positively for palpable plaque, newly occurring angulation or curvature and painful erection was 1.5 percent between the ages of 30 and 39, 3 percent between 40 and 49, 3 percent between 50 and 59, 4 percent between 60 and 69, and 6.5 percent over 70.

In 534 men undergoing routine prostate screening for cancer detection (without a specific urologic complaint), the prevalence of PD was 8.9 percent. In this study, the mean age of those with PD was 68.2 years compared with 61.8 years of those without PD.

==History==
The condition was first described in 1561 in correspondence between Andreas Vesalius and Gabriele Falloppio and separately by Gabriele Falloppio. The condition is named after François Gigot de la Peyronie, who described it in 1743.

<text>The Bristol Mercury is a British nine-cylinder, air-cooled, single-row, piston radial engine. Designed by Roy Fedden of the Bristol Aeroplane Company it was used to power both civil and military aircraft of the 1930s and 1940s. Developed from the earlier Jupiter engine, later variants could produce 800 horsepower (600 kW) from its capacity of 1,500 cubic inches (25 L) by use of a geared supercharger.

Almost 21,000 engines were produced, with a number also being built under license elsewhere in Europe. Several examples remain airworthy, with other preserved examples on public display in aviation museums.

==Design and development==
The Mercury was developed by the Bristol Aeroplane Company in 1925 as their Bristol Jupiter was reaching the end of its lifespan. Although the Mercury initially failed to attract much interest, the Air Ministry eventually funded three prototypes and it became another winner for the designer Roy Fedden.

With the widespread introduction of superchargers to the aviation industry in order to improve altitude performance, Fedden felt it was reasonable to use a small amount of boost at all times in order to improve performance of an otherwise smaller engine. Instead of designing an entirely new block, the existing Jupiter parts were re-used with the stroke reduced by one inch (25 mm). The smaller capacity engine was then boosted back to Jupiter power levels, while running at higher rpm and thus requiring a reduction gear for the propeller. The same techniques were applied to the original Jupiter-sized engine to produce the Pegasus.

The Mercury&#x27;s smaller size was aimed at fighter use and it powered the Gloster Gauntlet and its successor, the Gloster Gladiator. It was intended that the larger Pegasus would be for bombers, but as the power ratings of both engines rose, the Mercury was used in almost all roles. Perhaps its most famous use was in a twin-engine light bomber, the Bristol Blenheim.

In 1938 Roy Fedden pressed the Air Ministry to import supplies of 100 octane aviation spirit from the US. This new fuel would allow aero engines to run at higher compression ratios and supercharger boost pressure than the existing 87-octane fuel, thus increasing the power. The Mercury XV was one of the first British aero engines to be type-tested and cleared to use the 100-octane fuel in 1939. This engine was capable of running with a boost pressure of +9 lbs/sq.in (0.62 bar) and was first used in the Blenheim Mk IV.

The Mercury was also the first British aero engine to be approved for use with variable-pitch propellers.

The Bristol company and its shadow factories produced 20,700 examples of the engine.
Outside the United Kingdom, Mercury was licence-built by Państwowe Zakłady Lotnicze in Poland and used in the PZL P.11 fighters. It was also built by NOHAB in Sweden and used in the Swedish Gloster Gladiator fighters and in the Saab 17 dive-bomber. In Italy, it was built by Alfa Romeo as the Mercurius. In Czechoslovakia it was built by Walter Engines. In Finland, it was built by Tampella and mainly used on Bristol Blenheim bombers.

<text>Auguste de Montferrand (; ; January 23, 1786 – July 10, 1858) was a French classicist architect who worked primarily in Russia. His two best known works are the Saint Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral and the Alexander Column in Saint Petersburg.

==Early life==

===Family===
Montferrand was born in the parish of Chaillot, France (now the 16th &quot;arrondissement&quot; of Paris). He was styled at birth
Henri Louis Auguste Leger Ricard de Montferrand; the aristocratic &quot;de&quot; was probably his parents&#x27; invention. Decades later, Montferrand admitted in his will that, although his father owned Montferrand estate (his family was from the town of Montferrand), the title is disputable &quot;and if there is any doubt, I can accept other names, first of all Ricard, after my father&quot;. Montferrand&#x27;s father, Benois Ricard, was a horse trainer who died when Montferrand was a child; his grandfather, Leger Ricard, was a bridge engineer. Montferrand&#x27;s mother, Marie Francoise Louise Fistioni, remarried to Antoine de Commarieux, who is credited with educating Montferrand. 

===Education and War===
In 1806, Montferrand joined the former &quot;Académie d&#x27;architecture&quot;, joining class of Charles Percier and Pierre Fontaine. Soon, he was summoned to Napoleon&#x27;s Army, and served a brief tour of duty in Italy.

Montferrand married Julia Mornais in 1812. The next year, he was again drafted into the Army when Allied troops were approaching Dresden. Montferrand served with distinction in Thuringia, and was awarded the Légion d&#x27;honneur for valor in the Battle of Hanau.

===Career beginnings===
When hostilities ended, new construction in defeated France was out of the question. Montferrand worked on a few unimportant jobs, spending three years performing basic draftsmanship and seeking opportunities overseas. In 1815, he was granted an audience with Alexander I of Russia, and presented the Tsar with an album of his works.

In the summer of 1816, Montferrand landed in St. Petersburg, carrying a recommendation letter from Abraham-Louis Breguet. He rented a room near the house of Fyodor Wigel, the secretary of the Construction Commission, and applied to Agustín de Betancourt, the chairman of the commission (and a partner of Breguet&#x27;s in the 1790s). Betancourt, impressed by Breguet&#x27;s letter and Montferrand&#x27;s drawings, offered Montferrand the desk of Head of Draftsmen, but Montferrand preferred the lower rank of senior draftsman. On December 21, 1816, he officially joined the Russian service.

==Work==
Montferrand&#x27;s name is associated with St. Petersburg. However, working with Betancourt, he also designed buildings in Moscow, Odessa, and Nizhny Novgorod. His first major project, the Odessa Lycaeum, did not materialize due to financing problems. His designs for the Moscow Manege (1825) and Moscow fountains (1823) were also abandoned; these projects were completed by Joseph Bové and Ivan Vitali.

===Nizhny Novgorod Fair (1817–1825)===
In 1816, an accidental fire destroyed the Makaryev Fair. The fairgrounds were transferred to Nizhny Novgorod, equipped with temporary wooden trade rows. Betancourt visited the site in 1817 and proposed a six-million-rouble, four-year project to rebuild the Fair using stone. Alexander I approved it, at the expense of halting the reconstruction of the Winter Palace

Montferrand, as chief architect, reported to Betancourt, who personally managed the project. Montferrand started with the two-story main administration building. This traditional, neoclassical design was marked by custom column capitals with a caduceus motif. The fair itself consisted of eight two-story corner blocks and 48 standard trade row buildings. The fairground terminated in a row of four &quot;Chinese&quot; pavilions, each with pagoda roofs; the neoclassical Saviour&#x27;s Cathedral, and was encircled with a wide &quot;Betancourt&#x27;s Canal&quot;—a precaution against fire.

Despite shortages in manpower and material, the Fair opened in July 1822. Rectification work proceeded to 1825 and consumed a further 3.5 million roubles. The Fair operated until 1930; most of its buildings were torn down during the Soviet era, but the Saviour&#x27;s Cathedral survives.

===St. Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral (1816–1858)===

The previous St. Isaac&#x27;s, laid down by Antonio Rinaldi in 1768, was partially completed in 1802 by Vincenzo Brenna. In 1816, Alexander I assigned Betancourt to find the architect who could rebuild the cathedral; Betancourt pointed at Montferrand. Four original concepts, using as much of the old structure as possible, failed; the fifth was approved in February 1818. Rivalry between court architects temporarily halted the project between 1821 and 1825.

Montferrand&#x27;s first decision was to use a slab foundation, rather than a perimeter of piles. The foundation work took five years. It took more than a decade to obtain the 48 granite columns for the main portico. Columns were roughly cut in Fredrikshamn, delivered by barge, and finished on site one by one, using a gigantic lathe of Montferrand&#x27;s own design. The columns were raised in 1828–1830; polishing took four more years. In the same time, bricklayers completed the main walls and vaulted ceilings.

Montferrand was nearly killed in November 1837, when the crews were lifting 64-ton dome columns to their full height. Montferrand fell from the scaffolds, but nearby workers managed to catch him.

The design of St. Isaac&#x27;s domes was novel. Prior to St. Isaac&#x27;s, steel-frame exterior domes were coupled to masonry internal domes. Montferrand proposed an all-metal triple-dome system, where the middle conical dome carried the lightweight interior and exterior frames. This reduced dome weight from an estimated to ; a further was saved in the construction process. The dome, completed in 1841, cost two million roubles less than originally estimated.

Decorating the cathedral&#x27;s interior took another 16 years. Montferrand managed artists such as Karl Briullov and his brothers, Peter Clodt, and Ivan Vitali, all under close inspection by the State and Academy bureaucracies. The cathedral opened on May 30, 1858—the 186th anniversary of Peter the Great&#x27;s birth.

===Alexander Column (1829–1834)===

Montferrand designed the monument to the late Alexander I as a column, crowned with a cross; later, he changed the cross to an angel. The cost was estimated at 1.2 million roubles. The column had to be carved out of Finnish rocks in Virolahti, more than from St. Petersburg, and transported by barge. Critics predicted that the column would fall apart upon separation from the rock, but Montferrand&#x27;s experience with the columns of St. Isaac&#x27;s persuaded Nicholas I, who approved the project in December 1829.

Montferrand selected the quarry contractor in March 1830, in a bidding war that reduced the column price from 420 thousand to 150 thousand roubles. Carving took a year and a half, and in September 1831 the column safely separated from the rock. By April 1832, the carvers completed shaping it and started blasting the path from the quarry to the loading bay. The barge loading nearly ended in a catastrophe. The column broke through the ramp and threatened to roll over the barge; a team of 300 workers managed to set it back in place.

At the same time, crews in St. Petersburg prepared the foundation and scaffolding; the cost estimate doubled to 2.36 million roubles. Montferrand summoned a total of 2,090 soldiers, officers, and professionals to erect the column, raising it safely on August 30, 1832. Precisely two years later, the monument was inaugurated by Nicholas.

In 1836–1837, Montferrand completed the Palace Square with fencing and gas lights. He prepared five different designs for the building terminating the eastern side of the square, but the Guards Corps building was awarded to Alexander Brullov.

===Completion of Kazansky Cathedral and Square (1827–1837)===
As the chief architect of St. Petersburg&#x27;s largest construction site, Montferrand supervised many other architectural jobs for the State, notably repairs of Kazan Cathedral. The cathedral was built in 1801–1811 by Andrey Voronikhin with temporary fittings. By 1827, the plaster sculptures were falling apart, and a leaking roof threatened to destroy frescoes and floors. Nicholas assigned Montferrand to fix the roof, replace floors, and install permanent, durable sculptures and finishes. Montferrand also supervised new fresco paintings (&quot;The Four Evangelists&quot;). He lost the bid to design the new iconostasis to young Konstantin Thon.

Montferrand, as the cathedral&#x27;s architect, landscaped the adjacent square and designed the monuments to Kutuzov and Barclay de Tolly. The statues were made by Boris Orlovsky, and the bases by Vasily Stasov.

===Monument to Nicholas I (1856–1859)===
The Monument to Nicholas I was Montferrand&#x27;s last work, commissioned by Alexander II in May 1856. The foundation and base was started with leftovers from the St. Isaac&#x27;s site.

The contract for the equestrian statue was awarded to Peter Clodt. Clodt completed the model in the summer of 1857. The first bronze cast was lost when the mold cracked; a second statue was cast in February 1859—after Montferrand&#x27;s death.

===Other works===
==Personal life==

===Art collection===

Monferrand divorced his first wife soon after settling in St. Petersburg. The divorce, and his extravagant lifestyle, led to considerable debt; in 1831, he refinanced his debt with a loan from the Tsar&#x27;s Cabinet. In 1834, he was awarded a lifelong pension and a 100,000-rouble lump sum, enabling him to settle his accounts and build his own house. As his finances improved, Montferrand became a compulsive art collector, amassing 110 Greek and Roman statues and hundreds of lesser items. Witnesses reported that &quot;any Sunday he indulged in rearranging the statues, using 25 laborers from 9 a.m. to lunch time&quot;. When Monferrand died, the Hermitage Museum failed to buy out the collection, and it was dispersed.

===Second marriage===
In 1835, Montferrand married Elise Debonniere, an actress who had arrived in St. Petersburg nine years earlier. The relationship began in the 1820s and lasted until his death. Montferrand adopted Henri, Elise&#x27;s nephew.

===Death and legacy===
Montferrand died in St. Petersburg in 1858, the year St. Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral was completed. His desire to be buried in the vault of that cathedral could not be executed, because he was not of the Orthodox faith. His body was returned to France and buried in Montmartre Cemetery, Paris, next to his mother. The grave, once believed to be lost, was identified in 1986 in Chemin des Gardes row. It bears the name Louise Fistioni (Montferrand&#x27;s mother) and &quot;AM&quot;, Montferrand&#x27;s initials.

<text>A light bomber is a relatively small and fast type of military bomber aircraft that was primarily employed before the 1950s. Such aircraft would typically not carry more than one ton of ordnance.

The earliest light bombers were intended to drop their bombs in level flight over a target. During World War I some air forces began to distinguish between light bombers and the earliest purpose-built [[attack aircraft]] which carried out ground attack, close air support, anti-shipping and similar missions. After World War I, attack aircraft were typically identifiable by their ability to carry multiple fixed machine guns, automatic cannons and rockets in addition to bombs. Light bombers have often served as attack aircraft and vice versa.

Purpose-built light bombers disappeared from military aviation by the end of World War II, as advancements in propulsion and aeronautical design enabled newer attack/strike aircraft, fighter-bombers, and multirole aircraft types to deliver equal or greater bomb loads while also having superior performance, range and defensive capabilities. Modern aircraft carrying out similar missions include light attack aircraft, strike fighters, and counter-insurgency aircraft.

==History==
===Before 1914===
The first aircraft purposely designed for bombing missions were the Italian Caproni Ca 30 and British Bristol T.B.8, both built in 1913. The T.B.8 was a single engine biplane built by the Bristol Aeroplane Company. It was fitted with a prismatic bombsight in the front cockpit and a cylindrical bomb carrier in the lower forward fuselage capable of carrying 12 x 10 lb (12 x 4.5 kg) bombs, which could be dropped individually or all together. The T.B.8 was purchased for use both by the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and the Royal Flying Corps (RFC).

===World War I===
The Eastbourne RNAS Squadron, operating the T.B.3, carried out the first bombing attack of World War I: on 25 November 1914, under the command of Charles Rumney Samson, the squadron attacked coastal gun batteries operated by German Empire forces, at Middelkerke, Belgium.

Most bombers used on World War I battlefields were in fact light bombers: typically single-engine biplanes with a bomb load of 50–400 kg. Two of the most famous were the Airco DH.4 designed by Geoffrey de Havilland, and the Breguet 14 designed by Louis Breguet. The same type often also served as reconnaissance aircraft; examples include the Albatros C.III, Avro 504, DFW C.V, LVG C.II, Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8, Rumpler C.I and Voisin III. The Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2 was even modified as a pioneering night fighter in attempts to shoot down German Zeppelins.

===1918–1939===

By the early 1930s many air forces were seeking to replace their older biplane aircraft (for example, the RAF&#x27;s Hawker Hart and &quot;VVS&quot;&#x27;s Polikarpov R-5) with more modern and higher performance monoplane designs. Specialised light bomber designs were single-engine or twin-engine aircraft with a bomb load of about 500–1,000 kg. Typical single-engine light bombers of this era included the Fairey Battle, Kawasaki Ki-32 (later known by the Allied reporting name &quot;Mary&quot;), Mitsubishi Ki-30 (&quot;Ann&quot;), Mitsubishi Ki-51 (&quot;Sonia&quot;), PZL.23 &quot;Karaś&quot;, and Sukhoi Su-2. Contemporaneous twin-engine light bombers included the Bristol Blenheim, Douglas B-23 Dragon, Kawasaki Ki-48 (&quot;Lily&quot;), Martin Maryland (also known as the A-22), Lockheed Hudson, Tupolev SB, and Mitsubishi G3M (&quot;Nell&quot;). While the Mitsubishi G3M was classified by the Imperial Japanese Navy as a medium bomber, it was a land-based day bomber with bomb loads as small as 800 kg (1,800 lb) and had a secondary role as a torpedo bomber. Many of these aircraft were also used in other non-offensive roles, such as reconnaissance and maritime patrol.

A sub-type of light bomber also emerged in the 1930s, the fast bomber (German &quot;Schnellbomber&quot;), which prioritised speed as a self-defense measure; even the bomb load was minimised towards this design goal. Early examples were the Bristol Blenheim and Dornier Do 17 (both introduced in 1937). A weakness of the fast bomber design concept was that improvements in the speed of bombers were, in most cases, quickly matched in subsequent fighter designs (which would additionally eclipse the load-carrying ability of light bomber aircraft within a few years).

===World War II===
During the early stages of World War II, the above-mentioned designs of the late 1930s often saw considerable action. In some cases, they became the basis of newer, faster light bombers, such as the Martin Baltimore (U.S. designation A-23/A-30 developed from the Maryland), as well as medium bombers with more powerful engines and heavier payloads.

Twin-engine light bombers were successful when converted into airborne radar-equipped night fighters during World War II; examples include the Bristol Blenheim, Douglas A-20 Havoc (as the P-70), and Dornier Do 17. Light bombers were selected as a basis for night fighters during this time because early airborne radar systems, used to find and track targets in the dark, were bulky and often required a dedicated operator in the crew; most smaller day fighters of that era were unsuited to such extra weight and personnel. Conversely, the Petlyakov Pe-3, which had been designed as a night fighter, was often used a light bomber.

Many other aircraft which originally had been designed as fighters or other mission-specific bombers but fit the size, performance and payload requirements for the light bomber role would also be adapted to perform such missions during World War II. Most dive bombers, such as the Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; and Vultee Vengeance were light bombers by definition, as these aircraft typically carried bomb loads of one ton or less. Likewise, many torpedo bombers were light bombers according to their size and warload and it was common for these aircraft to also be used for level bombing missions. The Bristol Beaufort, Nakajima B5N and Grumman TBF Avenger, while designed as torpedo bombers, saw some action purely in the light bomber role. Types designed before the war as heavy fighters were also frequently adapted as light bombers, including the Messerschmitt Bf 110, Potez 633, Fokker G.I, Kawasaki Ki-45, Bristol Beaufighter, and Lockheed P-38 Lightning.

Light attack aircraft such as the Breda Ba.65, Ilyushin Il-2 &quot;Šturmovík&quot;, Northrop A-17, and Vultee V-11 initially differed little in armament and operational role from light bombers. As World War II progressed, specialised attack designs became increasingly focused on low altitude strafing of surface targets, armed with automatic cannons, heavy machine guns and newly developed rockets; the A-20 and B-25 Mitchell (type-classed as a medium bomber) each had variants with 8 or more forward-firing machine guns for ground strafing missions. Later variants of the Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bomber were adapted to the role of ground attack against tanks armed with 37 mm cannon, and the Curtiss SB2C Helldiver (a U.S. Navy dive bomber adopted later in World War II when that design role was beginning to disappear) also was assigned to ground attack sorties using its cannon, bombs and rockets.

The light bomber, as a discrete aircraft type, began to be superseded as World War II opened. The growth of engine power from the 1,000 hp to the 2,000 hp class during the war produced single-engine fighters with greater performance, offensive and defensive capabilities than the light bombers of only a few years earlier. This gave rise to the fighter-bomber type, notably the Fw 190 F and G models, Hawker Typhoon and Republic P-47 Thunderbolt. Multirole twin-engine designs capable of hauling bomb loads greater than 2,000 lbs such as the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, Junkers Ju 88 and de Havilland Mosquito also supplanted earlier 1930s-era light bomber designs during the war.

One of the last light bombers to be introduced in World War II, the U.S. Douglas A-26 Invader, replaced the earlier A-20 Havoc type and also was designated by the USAAF as a replacement for its Martin B-26 Marauder (which had the same engines and a similar bomb load as the Invader) medium bomber.

===Post-World War II===
The substantial increases in performance, load-carrying ability, and multirole versatility of new combat aircraft designs (including the advent of jet aircraft) by the end of World War II signaled the end of the dedicated light bomber type. Attack aircraft, strike fighters, counter-insurgency aircraft and combat UAVs are types which today carry out technologically enhanced equivalents of the former light bomber role.

<text>BESM (БЭСМ) is the series of Soviet mainframe computers built in 1950–60s. The name is an acronym for &quot;Bolshaya (or Bystrodeystvuyushchaya) Elektronno-schotnaya Mashina&quot; (&quot;Большая электронно-счётная машина&quot; or &quot;Быстродействующая электронно-счётная машина&quot;), meaning &quot;Big Electronic Computing Machine&quot; or &quot;High-Speed Electronic Computing Machine&quot;. It was designed at the Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Engineering 

==Models==
The BESM series included six models.

===BESM-1===
&quot;BESM-1&quot;, originally referred to as simply the BESM or BESM AN (&quot;BESM Akademii Nauk&quot;, BESM of the Academy of Sciences), was completed in 1952. Only one BESM-1 machine was built. The machine used approximately 5,000 vacuum tubes. At the time of completion, it was the fastest computer in Europe. The floating-point numbers were represented as 39-bit words: 32 bits for the mantissa, one bit for sign, and 1 + 5 bits for the exponent. It was capable of representing numbers in the range 10−9 – 1010. BESM-1 had 1024 words of read–write memory using ferrite cores, and 1024 words of read-only memory based on semiconducting diodes. It also had external storage: four magnetic tape units of 30,000 words each, and fast magnetic drum storage with a capacity of 5120 words and an access rate of 800 words/second. The computer was capable of performing 8–10 K Flops. The energy consumption was approximately 30 kW, not accounting for the cooling systems.

===BESM-2===
&quot;BESM-2&quot; also used vacuum tubes.

===BESM-3M and BESM-4===
&quot;BESM-3M&quot; and &quot;BESM-4&quot; were built using transistors. Their architecture was similar to that of the M-20 and M-220 series. The word size was 45 bits. Thirty BESM-4 machines were built. BESM-4 was used to create the first ever computer animation. The prototypes of both models were made in 1962–63, and the beginning of the series release was in 1964.

EPSILON (a macro language with high-level features including strings and lists, developed by Andrey Ershov at Novosibirsk in 1967) was used to implement ALGOL 68 on the M-220.

===BESM-6===
The BESM-6 was the best-known and most influential model of the series. The design was completed in 1965. Production started in 1968 and continued for the following 19 years.

<text>Harlingen (; ) is a municipality and a city in the northern Netherlands, in the province of Friesland.

==Overview==

=== Harbor ===
Harlingen is located on a tip of the Friesland coast that sticks out a bit into the Wadden Sea. Harlingen&#x27;s location is adjacent to some natural navigable routes through the Wadden Sea. This makes that the town still has a maritime character. However, the location on the Wadden Sea has always put limits on traffic to Harlingen. Even though the largest sailing ships can now reach Harlingen, this was not the case historically.

=== Tourism ===
The center of Harlingen has many monumental buildings. As a whole, the center is a protected view (beschermd stadsgezicht). In combination with its location on the Wadden Sea and the large fleet of historical shallow draught sailing vessels that operate out of Harlingen, this makes the town a center for tourism in Friesland. The municipality works to improve the connection between these attractions so the tourism can grow to its full potential.

=== Public transport ===
Harlingen is served by two stations on the railway line from Leeuwarden. Rederij Doeksen operate ferries to the Wadden islands of Vlieland and Terschelling that depart from Harlingen.

== History ==

=== Medieval times ===
Harlingen is a town with a long history of fishing and shipping. Historically, it was a two hour walk west from Franeker. It supposedly received city rights before it was walled. In 1462 most of the settlement was lost to a fire.

Harlingen was involved in the Vetkopers and Schieringers wars. In 1496 the inhabitants of Franeker, which supported the Schieringer party, conquered the lightly fortified city by surprise. Those of Groningen supported Harlingen and the Vetkopers, and had previously built a strong castle near the sea, but due the surprise it was lost. In 1498 Albert III, Duke of Saxony landed in Harlingen to support the Schieringer party and founded a new castle at the same place, which started the fortification of Harlingen.

=== The early modern period (1500–1800) ===
The first significant event of the early modern period was the first expansion of the fortified town in 1543. During the opening phases of the Eighty Years&#x27; War (1566–1648) a lot of religious fugitives settled in Harlingen. Many of these were Mennonites, a baptist branch of Protestantism. In 1579 and 1580 this led to a second major expansion of the town, which brought the village of Almenum into the city perimeter. Almenum holds a special place in the Christian history of Frisia.

In 1597 a third expansion followed. It led to the demolition of the old city walls, except for two round towers on the water front. A more modern system of earthen fortifications replaced it. It had five bastions on the east side and the ability to inundate most of the surrounding countryside.

In 1645, the Admiralty of Friesland was moved to Harlingen. It had previously been established in Dokkum in 1597. This admiralty had ten councilors: four from Friesland; one each from Gelderland, Utrecht, Holland, and Overijssel; and two from Groningen. In 1770 the admiralty building on the Nieuwe Haven burned down together with a number of adjacent warehouses. These had not been rebuilt by 1791.

After the reformation, the Dutch Protestant Church had two churches; the church called the &quot;Dome of Harlingen&quot; in Almenum, and the smaller Wester Kerk. The many Menonites, had two ministers. The Lutherans had their own church. The Catholics had a clandestine church, which was legal, but had to remain discreet.

The town hall was on the southern side of the Oude Haven. Behind it was the Weigh house and nearby the a building where the grain trade took place. The town had a Latin school with three teachers. There was an orphanage or shelter for the children of the poor.

In the later 18th century, Harlingen was the second city of Friesland with about 7,500 inhabitants. The city was heavily dependend on trade. From the Baltic, it merchants brought cereals, timber, flax, hemp, pitch, tar, and other shipping necessities. Harlingen also imported a lot of wine. All these goods were forwarded through the whole province as well as to Groningen province. The imports also led to the foundation of multiple wind powered sawmills in the vicinity.

Harlingen exported: butter, cheese, peas, beans, horses, cattle, and sheep. The animals were embarked at Harlingen and shipped to Holland and even outside of the Dutch Republic.

As regards industry, the inhabitants made sails, bombazine, Velours d&#x27;Utrecht, yarn, etc. Near the city a lot of salt was made. There were several works for roof tiles and for saucers and dishes. Harlingen also had some lime kilns. These early industrial enterprises relied on the fact that peat could cheaply be transported over water to Harlingen. Fishing was another steady means of existence for the population.

All this trade and industry had multiple causes. The first consisted of the natural navigable trenches in the Wadden Sea that connected to Harlingen. The second were the harbor works, which were greatly improved with the third city expansion in 1597. At that time, the Nieuwe Haven and the Oude Buitenhaven were created, both within the city limits. The Buitenhaven stuck out into the Wadden Sea with two dams. It meant that Harlingen was a port. However most of the heavily loaded ships had to transload on the roadstead or harbor before the town, before they could enter the Buitenhaven.

The third reason for the maritime activity in Harlingen was that the whole of Westergoa discharged its water on the Wadden Sea via two locks that exited in the Nieuwe- and Oude Haven. This was somewhat of a guarantee that the trenches in the Wadden Sea would remain in place. It also allowed the city to control the water level in the canals of Westergo. The most important of these was the Harlingertrekvaart from Harlingen to Franeker and then to Leeuwarden, most of which would later become part of the van Harinxmakanaal. In the 1640s, the municipalities of Harlingen and Leeuwarden constructed a towpath along the Harlingertrekvaart. This allowed for reliable and frequent transport to the town&#x27;s hinterland. In the 18th century, there was a daily connection by boat from Harlingen to Amsterdam and vice versa.

=== 19th century ===
Harlingen&#x27;s port remained significant in the 19th century. Already in the 1820s, the Amsterdamsche Stoomboot Maatschappij made a stop at Harlingen part of her Amsterdam-Hamburg line. While this was later omitted, Harlingen would retain a steam powered line to Amsterdam. Steam powered ships opened some new opportunities, especially for the export of agricultural products to England. By 1846 this was very important for the Frisian economy and led to severe competition between the shipping lines. After some time, the St. Petersburg Steamship Company came to dominate the export to London. The export of life cattle was much easier with steam boats and became important because cattle had to be slaughtered near the place of consumpton. By 1870 the General Steam Navigation Company (GSNC) also had a regular cattle line between London and Harlingen. In April 1876 GSNC acquired the boats of the Petersburg Steamship Company and thus elimated this competitor. In 1896 the route to Harlingen was one of GSNC&#x27;s most profitable lines. In the late 1890s, the GSNC ships on this line got cooling facilities. This allowed the export of the famous Frisian dairy products, especially butter with even less damage during transport.

The Harlingen–Nieuweschans railway was constructed between 1863 and 1868, before either Leeuwarden station or Groningen station got a connection to the south. This might have been related to the importance of the harbor of Harlingen. Later on Harlingen got a connection to a local light rail train service. From 1904 to 1935 there was a passenger service on the North Friesland Railway, freight being carried until January 1938.

The famous Dutch writer Simon Vestdijk was born in Harlingen and used to depict his hometown in his writings as Lahringen.

The town of Harlingen, Texas, in the United States is named after this city because many of the original settlers of the Texas town came from Harlingen.

<doc id="147268" wikidata="Q753224" url="?curid=147268" title="Torpedo bomber">
<text>A torpedo bomber is a military aircraft designed primarily to attack ships with aerial torpedoes. Torpedo bombers came into existence just before the First World War almost as soon as aircraft were built that were capable of carrying the weight of a torpedo, and remained an important aircraft type until they were rendered obsolete by anti-ship missiles. They were an important element in many famous Second World War battles, notably the British attack at Taranto, the sinking of the German battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;, the sinking of the British battleship &quot;HMS Prince Of Wales&quot; and the British battlecruiser &quot;HMS Repulse&quot; and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

==Types==
Torpedo bombers first appeared immediately prior to the First World War. Generally, they carried torpedoes specifically designed for air launch, which were smaller and lighter than those used by submarines and surface warships. Nonetheless, as an airborne torpedo could weigh as much as , more than twice the bomb load of contemporary single-engined bombers, the aircraft carrying it usually needed to be specially designed for the purpose. Many early torpedo bombers were floatplanes, such as the Short 184 (the first aircraft to sink a ship with a torpedo), and the undercarriage had to be redesigned so that the torpedo could be dropped from the aircraft&#x27;s centerline.

While many torpedo bombers were single-engine aircraft, some multi-engined aircraft have also been used as torpedo bombers, with the Mitsubishi G3M &quot;Nell&quot; and Mitsubishi G4M &quot;Betty&quot; being used in the sinking of HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot;. Other twin-engine or three-engined aircraft designed or used as torpedo bombers include the Mitsubishi Ki-67, the Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 &quot;Sparviero&quot;, the CANT Z.1007, the Bristol Beaufort and Bristol Beaufighter (&quot;Torbeau&quot;), the Junkers Ju 88, the Heinkel He 111, the B-25 Mitchell and many others.

Some postwar jet aircraft (such as the Ilyushin Il-28T) were adapted as torpedo bombers in the late 1940s and 1950s. The last known torpedo bomber attack was made by US Navy Skyraiders against the Hwacheon Dam during the Korean War. The North Korean Air Force finally retired the world&#x27;s last operational torpedo bombers in the 1980s.

In a parallel development, many maritime strike aircraft and helicopters have been capable of launching guided torpedoes; however, they are not generally referred to as torpedo bombers because of their vastly greater detection and tracking capabilities, although they remain just as capable of making attacks on surface ships as against submarines.

==History==
Many naval staffs began to appreciate the possibility of using aircraft to launch torpedoes against moored ships in the period before the First World War. Captain Alessandro Guidoni, an Italian naval captain, experimented with dropping weights from a Farman MF.7 in 1912. which led to Raúl Pateras Pescara and Guidoni developing a purpose-built torpedo bomber from which a 375 lb dummy torpedo was dropped in February 1914 but they abandoned their work shortly afterwards when the aircraft&#x27;s performance proved inadequate. Admiral Bradley A. Fiske of the United States Navy took out a patent in 1912 for a torpedo carrying aircraft entitled &quot;Method of and apparatus for delivering submarine torpedoes from airships.&quot; He suggested that aircraft would attack at night. Winston Churchill, as First Lord of the Admiralty from October 1911 to May 1915, was a strong proponent of naval air power. He established the Royal Naval Air Service in April 1912 and took flying lessons to foster aviation development. Churchill ordered the RNAS to design reconnaissance spotters and torpedo bombers for the Fleet.

=== First torpedo bombers ===
The British Admiralty ordered the Short Admiralty Type 81 biplane floatplane as a reconnaissance aircraft. It first flew in July 1913 and was loaded aboard the cruiser , which had been converted to become the Royal Navy&#x27;s first seaplane tender. When the rival Sopwith Special, designed from the outset as a torpedo bomber, failed to lift its payload off the water, Shorts converted the Type 81 to carry torpedoes in July 1914, just before the outbreak of the First World War.

On 28 July 1914, Arthur Longmore dropped the first aerial torpedo, a 14-inch 810 lb torpedo, from a Type 81 at the Royal Naval Air Station Calshot. The support wires of the floats were moved to allow the torpedo to be carried above the water and a specially designed quick-release mechanism was used.

The first plane designed from the outset as a torpedo bomber was the five-seat floatplane biplane AD Seaplane Type 1000 or AD1. However, it proved to be a failure. When the prototype built by J. Samuel White from the Isle of Wight first flew in June 1916, it was found to be too heavy and its float struts too weak for operations. Remaining orders were cancelled.

=== First World War ===
On 12 August 1915, a Royal Naval Air Service Short 184 floatplane torpedo bomber sank a Turkish merchantman in the Sea of Marmara. It was operating from , a seaplane carrier converted from a ferry. Fitted with an aircraft hangar, &quot;Ben-my-Chree&quot; was used to carry up to six biplanes with their wings folded back to reduce carrying space.

This was the first ship sunk by air-launched torpedo. Five days later, another ship supplying Turkish forces in the Gallipoli campaign against British, Australian and New Zealand troops was also sunk.

Production of the Short 184 continued until after the Armistice of 11 November 1918, with a total of 936 built by several manufacturers. It served in eight navies, including the Imperial Japanese Navy, which built them under licence.

The first torpedo bomber designed for operation from aircraft carriers was the Sopwith Cuckoo. First flown in June 1917, it was designed to take off from the Royal Navy&#x27;s new aircraft carriers, but had to land on an airfield as arrester wires, needed to stop an aircraft during landing on a ship, had not yet been perfected. The Admiralty planned to use five carriers and 100-120 Cuckoos to attack the German High Seas Fleet, which had been sheltering in Kiel since the Battle of Jutland in 1916 but when the war ended only 90 Cuckoos had been completed.

The Vickers Vimy twin-engine heavy bomber was designed to bomb German cities in retribution for German air attacks on England. It reached squadrons in France too late to play a role in the First World War. Had the war continued, it would have been deployed as a torpedo bomber.

=== Interwar years ===

Of the major maritime nations, only Britain, Japan and the United States developed carrier-borne torpedo bombers after hostilities ceased in Europe. Initially, Japan purchased both ships and aircraft from Britain, as the Imperial Japanese Navy modelled itself on the Royal Navy. Of the three, only Britain and Japan also perceived a need for land-based torpedo bombers, though a number would be developed by other countries. Bordered by oceans against any possible foe, the United States ignored landplane torpedo bomber development.

The first landplane specifically designed as a torpedo bomber was the Hawker Horsley. By the mid 1930s, the torpedo bombers that would start the Second World War were being deployed. The Fairey Swordfish flew first in 1934, the Douglas TBD Devastator and Mitsubishi G3M &quot;(Nell)&quot; in 1935 and the Nakajima B5N &quot;(Kate)&quot; and Bristol Beaufort a year after that.

=== Second World War ===
Even before the outbreak of the Second World War, the Royal Navy had studied the threat in the Mediterranean posed by the Italian fleet, which had its advance base in the new port of Taranto in the &quot;heel&quot; of Italy. Captain Lumley Lyster of the aircraft carrier proposed that his Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers could launch a night attack against Taranto. At that time, the Royal Navy was the only force in the world with this capability. The Swordfish, a three-seat biplane, looked outmoded, but its low stall speed made it an ideal platform for launching torpedoes into the shallow waters of Taranto. The torpedoes were adapted with wire cables attached to their nose and wooden fins at their tail to slow their fall and make a shallow impact with the water, which was only deep.

On the night of 11 November 1940, 21 Swordfish left the new aircraft carrier . Some carried bombs and flares, but the main force carried torpedoes. British decoy maneuvers and the Italians&#x27; lack of radar allowed the British to surprise the ill-prepared Italian fleet at anchor in Taranto. Three battleships were put out of action, half of the Italian fleet, for the loss of two Swordfish. Two airmen were killed and two others captured. The next day, the remaining Italian battleships withdrew to Naples, ceding control of the Mediterranean to the British.

On 6 April 1941, a single Bristol Beaufort piloted by Flying Officer Kenneth Campbell attacked the German battleship &quot;Gneisenau&quot; in Brest harbour in Brittany, where she and her sister ship, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, were sheltering beneath a massive array of anti-aircraft guns. The other five Beauforts on the mission failed to rendezvous due to bad weather. Campbell received a posthumous Victoria Cross for launching his solo torpedo attack, which put &quot;Gneisenau&quot; out of action for six months.

At 1900 hours on 26 May 1941, fifteen Fairey Swordfish were launched from the Royal Navy&#x27;s carrier to attack the German battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;. Their formation was badly disrupted by heavy clouds and driving rain which resulted in a series of piecemeal attacks. However, two torpedoes hit the &quot;Bismarck&quot;, one of which jammed the rudder leaving the ship without proper directional control. The next day the &quot;Bismarck&quot; was sunk by British battleships and cruisers.

In the early hours of 13 June 1941, two Beauforts found the German cruiser &quot;Lützow&quot; off Norway. The first was mistaken for a Junkers Ju 88 and was able to torpedo the &quot;Lützow&quot; without return fire, putting her out of action for six months. The second was shot down by defending Messerschmitt Bf 109s. 
In the attack on Pearl Harbor, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto&#x27;s fleet of six carriers launched 40 Nakajima B5N2 &quot;Kate&quot; torpedo bombers on Sunday, 7 December 1941. The Japanese struck the United States Pacific Fleet when it was moored in harbour. The torpedo bombers coordinated their attacks with dive bombers; the combined effort sank or damaged all eight of the battleships which they found moored in Pearl Harbor. The Japanese had studied the attack on Taranto and had practiced dropping specially modified Type 91 torpedoes in the shallow waters of Japan&#x27;s Inland Sea. The Type 91 torpedo was considerably more capable than any others in the world at that time, being very fast and reliable, as well as allowing a much higher launch speed from a much greater altitude than other types. Only five Kates were lost in the attack. In later months, torpedo bombers were responsible for the sinking of the American aircraft carriers and , and damaging .
During the war, Japanese torpedo bombers (mainly the Nakajima B5N) played a key role in the fatal crippling of the carriers USS &quot;Lexington&quot; (scuttled as a result of an internal explosion), USS &quot;Yorktown&quot; (sunk by a Japanese submarine while being towed), and USS &quot;Hornet&quot; (abandoned and finished off by US and Japanese surface ships).

Three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Admiral Sir Tom Phillips was returning to Singapore on board the new battleship after an unsuccessful attempt to impede Japanese landings in Malaya. His fleet included the First World War battlecruiser and should also have had the new aircraft carrier with a squadron of Sea Hurricanes. But the carrier was delayed for repairs after running aground in the harbour at Kingston, Jamaica. Eight Mitsubishi G3M &quot;Nell&quot; twin-engine level bombers and 17 Nell torpedo bombers found the two capital ships without air cover in broad daylight. They scored just a single bomb hit on &quot;Repulse&quot; and a single torpedo hit on &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. The torpedo struck where the outer port propeller shaft exited the hull and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; took on of water through a ruptured stern gland. The battleship listed 12 degrees to port preventing the starboard side 5.25 inch anti-aircraft guns from depressing low enough to deter more torpedo bombers. A second squadron, this time of Mitsubishi G4M &quot;Betty&quot; torpedo bombers, now attacked both ships. &quot;Repulse&quot; had dodged 19 torpedoes by skillful steering, but now G4Ms attacked the bow from both sides and scored another hit. At about this point, &quot;Repulse&quot; radioed for defensive fighters. A squadron of 10 Royal Australian Air Force Brewster Buffalos arrived an hour later to watch &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; sink. &quot;Repulse&quot; had already sunk. Each ship had been hit by four torpedoes out of 49 fired. The Japanese lost four aircraft. Neither G3Ms nor G4Ms carried defensive armament, which had been stripped to extend their range. The presence of modern Allied fighters to defend the two capital ships might have led to a different outcome.

On 12 February 1942, Bristol Beauforts were dispatched to intercept the German cruiser &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; off Trondheim, Norway. &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; had accompanied &quot;Bismarck&quot; into the Atlantic, but returned to Brest. For the first time, the Beauforts were accompanied by Bristol Beaufighters and Bristol Blenheims. In a new RAF tactic, the Blenheims acted as decoys, making pretense torpedo runs, while the Beaufighters, a development of the Beaufort fitted with four 20mm cannon, shot up the anti-aircraft gunners. This was intended to give the Beauforts a clear torpedo run. However, none of the 28 Beauforts achieved a hit, and three aircraft were lost.

The United States Navy&#x27;s standard torpedo bomber in 1942 was the Douglas TBD Devastator, first flown in 1935 and embarked on carriers of the Pacific Fleet in 1937. On 7 May 1942, Devastators sank the Japanese aircraft carrier &quot;Shōhō&quot; in the Battle of the Coral Sea, but failed to sink the aircraft carrier &quot;Shōkaku&quot; the next day.

At the Battle of Midway on 4 June 1942, 41 Devastators launched from three American carriers failed to score a single torpedo hit, and only six aircraft returned, as the rest fell to the Mitsubishi A6M Zero combat air patrols and ships&#x27; anti-aircraft fire. The attacks had been poorly coordinated, but the Devastator sorties were credited with pulling the defending A6M Zeros out of position, as well as preventing the Japanese carriers from launching their aircraft, so three of the four carriers were caught with their hangar decks full of fueled and armed planes when the American dive bombers struck by surprise. Nonetheless, the Devastator was immediately withdrawn from front-line service. The successor to the Devastator, the Grumman TBF Avenger, arrived too late at Pearl Harbor to be loaded onto carriers for the Battle of Midway. However, six were flown from Midway Island. They fared no better, with five lost without a single hit.

Avengers became more successful as tactics improved and crews became more skilled. On 24 August 1942, 24 Avengers sank the light carrier &quot;Ryūjō&quot; at the Battle of the Eastern Solomons. At Guadalcanal, Avengers from the Navy and Marine Corps helped to finish off the battleship &quot;Hiei&quot;, which had lost steering after being damaged the prior night.

Beauforts also had more success when they moved to Malta to attack Italian warships and transport. Flying Officer Arthur Aldridge discovered a convoy guarded by the heavy cruiser &quot;Trento&quot; early on 14 June 1942 some east of Malta. As in the attack on &quot;Lützow&quot;, the Beaufort was mistaken for a Junkers Ju 88, and Aldridge hit &quot;Trento&quot; with his torpedo; the ship was eventually finished off by the submarine , which was close by.

At the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, with little or no Japanese air cover opposing them, US carrier aircraft concentrated most of their attacks against &quot;Musashi&quot;, sinking her with about 19 torpedoes that caused heavy flooding which disabled her engineering (dive bombers also scored around 17 bomb hits), while an aerial torpedo crippled the heavy cruiser Myōkō, which was never repaired for the remainder of the war.

Action continued in the Pacific, where the last notable torpedo bomber attack took place on 7 April 1945. Avengers from &quot;Yorktown&quot; were searching between Okinawa and Honshu for the Japanese battleship &quot;Yamato&quot;, which was escorted by cruisers and destroyers. Her mission was to run aground on Okinawa to provide floating heavy artillery for the defending troops in the expected Allied seaborne invasion. Her 18.1 inch guns could have created havoc among frail landing craft. &quot;Yamato&quot; and her sister the &quot;Musashi&quot; were the largest, most powerful battleships in the world. The squadron led by Lieutenant Tom Stetson found the cruiser, which was the prime target, already sinking, so six planes were detached to attack the &quot;Yamato&quot; instead. One in which Frederick E. Wicklund was the tail gunner and radar/radio operator became detached from the formation whilst climbing in heavy cloud cover. The pilot, Lieutenant Grady Jean, asked each crewman in turn if they wished to make a solo attack, which was likely to prove suicidal. The crew referred the decision to the skipper, who deftly dodged anti-aircraft fire and 18-inch shell splashes from the &quot;Yamato&quot;″s big guns to release their torpedo. Wicklund had recalled from a briefing that the &quot;Yamato&quot; had torpedo blisters to a depth of , so he crawled back in the fuselage to reset the torpedo&#x27;s running depth from the preset for the cruiser to . He later explained that he heard no command to do this and doubted whether the other five planes had done so. In their case, their torpedoes would have exploded harmlessly against the blisters. A crewman photographed the explosion, in which debris rose to their altitude of . Possibly a torpedo had hit the fuel storage. The &quot;Yamato&quot; rolled over and sank, with the loss of 90 percent of the crew. The &quot;Yorktown&quot; lost ten planes and twelve aircrew. All pilots involved in the attack were awarded the Navy Medal and every crewman the Distinguished Flying Cross.

=== Replacement and obsolescence ===
The torpedoes in use during the early 20th century travelled under water at about – a speed easily matched by destroyers and even fast battleships which could make . Consequently, a skillful captain could often evade torpedoes. For instance, when came under attack on 10 December 1941, she avoided 19 torpedoes, before Japanese aircraft attacked simultaneously from both forward quarters.

Caltech developed the &quot;Holy Moses&quot; High Velocity Aircraft Rocket, with a warhead for the US Navy. It was rushed to Europe for use on D-Day and later used by Navy aircraft in the Pacific.

====Multi-role attack/strike aircraft====
By the beginning of the Second World War, aircraft technology had increased to the extent that specialised torpedo bombers were no longer necessary.

Multi-role designs were often adapted from either: single-engined, carrier-based dive-bombers like the Aichi B7A &quot;Ryusei&quot;, Curtiss SB2C Helldiver and Fairey Barracuda, or; land-based twin-engined light bombers/attack aircraft, such as the Bristol Beaufighter, Douglas A-20C (Boston IIIA), Junkers Ju 88, and Tupolev Tu-2.

As the war progressed, single-seat designs also emerged – omitting the roles of gunner, bombardier/bomb-aimer and/or observer. This configuration was favoured by the US Navy, in particular, and included the Martin AM Mauler and Douglas A-1 Skyraider, both of which could carry up to three torpedoes.
Another concept, the torpedo fighter, also known as the strike fighter, was intended to also have air superiority capabilities – when it was not carrying or had dropped its torpedo. However, the radically differing requirements of these two roles created design constraints that made it difficult for a single design to excel at both. While some torpedo fighters were put into production, such as the Fiat G.55S and Blackburn Firebrand, they seldom launched torpedoes at enemy ships.

From 1946, the US Navy officially discarded its separate designations for dive and torpedo bombers, and introduced a single &quot;Attack&quot; designation, similar to that already used by the USAAF. Conversely, the naval air services of the UK and other Commonwealth countries, persisted with specialised torpedo bombers such as the Grumman Avenger until the early 1960s.

While the importance of air-launched torpedoes declined, relative to anti-ship missiles, during the Cold War and subsequently, they were retained by many air services and are now generally delivered by anti-submarine warfare and maritime patrol aircraft.

==Tactics==
One crucial limitation of a torpedo bomber was that it had to fly a long, straight course at a constant altitude of toward the target ship before launching its torpedo. Torpedoes were very complicated weapons and were prone to damage when landing on water, especially on a wave; they were ideally aimed at the bottom of a wave, but this was difficult to achieve in practice.

During a torpedo run, the attacking aircraft were easy targets for defending combat air patrol fighters. Furthermore, torpedo planes were also highly vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire.

In the 1930s, the Imperial Japanese Navy developed the best way for torpedo bombers to achieve a hit. They used an &quot;anvil attack&quot;, in which two groups of torpedo planes approached the target ship&#x27;s bow from behind at an angle of about 45 degrees, one on each side of the ship. The torpedoes were to be launched at the same distance from the ship; this would have ensured a hit no matter where the ship tried to maneuver. In practice, this kind of attack was difficult to coordinate and therefore extremely rare. Usually, combat air patrols and anti-aircraft fire quickly broke up approaching plane formations, forcing each aircraft to attack on its own. At Pearl Harbor, the ships were lined up and basically stationary, so the first attack wave of 40 torpedo bombers armed with Type 91 torpedoes, out of 183 planes, were able to hit the ships broadside, as the defenders were caught by surprise.

Torpedo bombers were best used as part of a coordinated attack with other types of aircraft. For instance, during the attack on the battleship &quot;Yamato&quot;, fighter planes strafed the ship with machine guns to suppress its anti-aircraft gun fire, while dive bombers tried to cause havoc and inflict topside damage, thus leaving the torpedo bombers unmolested in their attack runs, In total she took 12 torpedoes and 8 bombs to destroy the pride of the imperial Japanese Navy.

Another instance, during the attack on battleship &quot;Musashi&quot;, fighter planes strafed the ship with machine guns to suppress its anti-aircraft gun fire, while dive bombers caused major topside damage, She holds the distinction of taking 19 torpedoes and 17 bombs before she sank to the bottom of the Sibuyan Sea. 

However, if the attackers failed to achieve air superiority or surprise, torpedo bombers suffered heavy losses, regardless of whether the type was obsolete or not. This is best exemplified at the Battle of Midway, where Air Group Eight&#x27;s dive bombers missed the Japanese carriers. Torpedo Squadron 8 (VT-8, from &quot;Hornet&quot;), led by Lieutenant Commander John C. Waldron, sighted the enemy carriers and attacked without any coordination with dive bombers or fighter cover. Without fighter escort, every TBD Devastator of VT-8 was shot down without inflicting any damage, with Ensign George H. Gay, Jr. being the only survivor. VT-8 was followed by Torpedo Squadron 6 (VT-6, from &quot;Enterprise&quot;). VT-6 met nearly the same fate, with no hits to show for its effort. Torpedo Squadron 3 (from &quot;Yorktown&quot;) then followed the same routine, despite VT-3 having six Grumman F4F Wildcat fighter escorts. The Japanese combat air patrol, flying the much faster Mitsubishi A6M2 &quot;Zeros&quot;, made short work of the unescorted, slow, under-armed TBD torpedo bombers. A few TBDs managed to get within a few ship-lengths range of their targets before dropping their torpedoes.

At the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands in 1942, the Nakajima B5N &quot;Kate&quot;, despite being in service since 1935, played a key role in sinking USS &quot;Hornet&quot;, while the new Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers failed to hit a fleet carrier.

When the targets were ships able to maneuver at high speed and hence much harder to hit, torpedoes proved less effective, except in cases when the crews launching them were especially well trained. Still, even a single torpedo hit on an enemy warship could cripple it decisively, especially in the case of vessels without an armored belt (cruisers and aircraft carriers often had torpedo blisters, but these were not as extensive as those of battleships). Even on heavily armored battleships, there was nothing to protect the rudder and propellers at the stern, as was demonstrated in the cases of the &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;HMS Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;HMS Repulse&quot;, and few had their protective belt extend to the extremities, and a hole made in the bow could be forced wider from the pressure of the water which could buckle and crush unarmored internal bulkheads, which worked against &quot;Musashi&quot; and &quot;Yamato&quot;.

<text>The pallium (derived from the Roman &quot;pallium&quot; or &quot;palla&quot;, a woolen cloak; : pallia) is an ecclesiastical vestment in the Catholic Church, originally peculiar to the pope, but for many centuries bestowed by the Holy See upon metropolitans and primates as a symbol of their conferred jurisdictional authorities, and still remains a papal emblem.

In its present (western) form, the pallium is a long and &quot;three fingers broad&quot; (narrow) white band adornment, woven from the wool of lambs raised by Trappist monks. It is donned by looping its middle around one&#x27;s neck, resting upon the chasuble and two dependent lappets over one&#x27;s shoulders with tail-ends (doubled) on the left with the front end crossing over the rear. When observed from the front or rear the pallium sports a stylistic letter &#x27;y&#x27; (contrasting against an unpatterned chasuble). It is decorated with six black crosses, one near each end and four spaced out around the neck loop. At times the pallium is embellished fore, aft, and at the left shoulder with three gold gem-headed (dull) stickpins. The doubling and pinning on the left shoulder likely survive from the (simple scarf) Roman pallium.

The pallium and the omophor originate from the same vestment, the latter a much larger and wider version worn by Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic bishops of the Byzantine Rite. A theory relates origination to the paradigm of the Good Shepherd shouldering a lamb, a common early Christian art image (if not icon); the ritual preparation of the pallium and its subsequent bestowal upon a pope at coronation suggests the shepherd symbolism. However, this may be an explanation &quot;a posteriori&quot;. The lambs whose fleeces are destined for pallia are solemnly presented at altar by the nuns of the convent of Saint Agnes outside the walls and ultimately the Benedictine nuns of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere weave their wool into pallia.

== Usage ==
At present, only the pope, metropolitan archbishops within their archdiocese, and the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem wear the pallium. Under the 1917 Code of Canon Law, a metropolitan had to receive the pallium before exercising his office in his ecclesiastical province, even if he was previously metropolitan elsewhere, but these restrictions were absent in the revised 1983 Code of Canon Law. No other bishops, even non-metropolitan archbishops or retired metropolitans or current metropolitan archbishops officiating or attending any kind of Mass or religious ceremony outside their jurisdiction, are allowed to wear the pallium unless they have special permission. An explicit exception is made for the rarely realised scenario in which a person not yet a bishop is elected pope, in which case the bishop ordaining the new pope wears the pallium during the ceremony.

== History ==
=== Origin ===
There are many different opinions concerning the origin of the pallium. Some trace it to an investiture by Constantine I (or one of his successors); others consider it an imitation of the Hebrew ephod, the humeral garment of the High Priest. Others declare that its origin is traceable to a mantle of St. Peter, which was symbolic of his office as supreme pastor. A fourth hypothesis finds its origin in a liturgical mantle, used by the early popes, which over time was folded into the shape of a band; a fifth says its origin dates from the custom of folding the ordinary mantle-pallium, an outer garment in use in imperial times; a sixth declares that it was introduced as a papal liturgical garment (which, however, was not at first a narrow strip of cloth, but as the name suggests, a broad, oblong, and folded cloth). There is no solid evidence tracing the pallium to an investiture of the emperor, the ephod of the Jewish High Priest, or a fabled mantle of St. Peter. It may well be that it was introduced as a liturgical badge of the pope, or that it was adopted in imitation of its counterpart, the pontifical omophor, already in vogue in the Eastern Church. It was bestowed on papal vicars (like the bishop of Arles, who represented the pope in the regions of Gaul) and other bishops with exclusive links to the Apostolic See. Also in this rank were missionaries sent with papal approval to organise the church among newly converted peoples. St. Augustine of Canterbury in seventh-century England and St. Boniface in eighth-century Germany fell into this category.
=== Early usage ===
It is unknown exactly when the pallium was first introduced. Although Tertullian wrote an essay no later than 220 AD titled &quot;De Pallio&quot; (&quot;On the Pallium&quot;), according to the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, it was first used when Pope Marcus (died 336) conferred the right to wear the pallium on the Bishop of Ostia, because the consecration of the pope appertained to him; Pope Symmachus did the same for St. Cæsarius of Arles in 513, and in numerous other references of the sixth century, the pallium is mentioned as a long-customary vestment. It seems that earlier, the pope alone had the absolute right of wearing the pallium; its use by others was tolerated only by virtue of the permission of the pope. References to the pallium being conferred on others as a mark of distinction date to the sixth century. The honour was usually conferred on metropolitans, especially those nominated vicars by the pope, but it was sometimes conferred on simple bishops (e.g., on Syagrius of Autun, Donus of Messina, and John of Syracuse by Pope Gregory I).

The use of the pallium among metropolitans did not become general until the eighth century, when a synod convened by St Boniface laid an obligation upon Western metropolitans of receiving their pallium only from the pope in Rome. This was accomplished by journeying there or by forwarding a petition for the pallium accompanied by a solemn profession of faith, all consecrations being forbidden them before the reception of the pallium. The oath of allegiance which the recipient of the pallium takes today apparently originated in the eleventh century, during the reign of Paschal II (1099–1118), and replaced the profession of faith.

The awarding of the pallium became controversial in the Middle Ages, because popes charged a fee from those receiving them, acquiring hundreds of millions of gold florins for the papacy and bringing the award of the pallium into disrepute. It is certain that a tribute was paid for the reception of the pallium as early as the sixth century. This was abrogated by Pope Gregory I in the Roman Synod of 595, but was reintroduced later as partial maintenance of the Holy See. This process was condemned by the Council of Basel in 1432, which referred to it as &quot;the most usurious contrivance ever invented by the papacy&quot;.

=== Modern use ===
The use of the pallium is reserved to the pope and archbishops who are metropolitans, but the latter may not use it until it is conferred upon them by the pope, normally at the celebration of the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul in June. Pope Francis modified the ritual of conferring the pallium in January 2015: The pallia will be blessed on the feast of Saints Peter and Paul in Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica; the metropolitan archbishops, however will receive those pallia in a separate ceremony within their home dioceses from the hands of the Apostolic Nuncio (who is the personal representative of the pope in their respective countries). The pallium is also conferred upon the Latin Rite patriarch of Jerusalem. Previous traditions that allowed some other bishops to use the pallium were ended by Pope Paul VI in a motu proprio in 1978. A metropolitan archbishop may wear his pallium as a mark of his jurisdiction not only in his own archdiocese but anywhere in his ecclesiastical province whenever he celebrates Mass.

Although the pallium is now reserved, by law and liturgical norms, to metropolitans, a single standing exception has seemed to become customary: Pope John Paul II conferred a pallium on then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger when Ratzinger became dean of the College of Cardinals and therefore also cardinal bishop of Ostia, a purely honorary title and one without an archbishopric or metropolitanate attached. When Ratzinger was elected Pope Benedict XVI, he continued that exception without comment by conferring the pallium on Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the new dean. The same was done by Pope Francis for Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re on 29 June 2020, when Cardinal Re became dean in January 2020.

Worn by the pope, the pallium symbolizes the &quot;plenitudo pontificalis officii&quot; (i.e., the &quot;plenitude of pontifical office&quot;); worn by archbishops, it typifies their participation in the supreme pastoral power of the pope, who concedes it to them for their proper church provinces. Similarly, after his resignation, he may not use the pallium; should he be transferred to another archdiocese, he must again petition the pope for a new pallium. The new pallia are solemnly blessed after the First Vespers on the feast of Saints Peter and Paul, and are then kept in a special silver-gilt casket near the &quot;Confessio Petri&quot; (tomb of St. Peter) until required. The pallium was formerly conferred in Rome by a cardinal deacon, and outside of Rome by a bishop; in both cases the ceremony took place after the celebration of Mass and the administration of an oath.
For his formal inauguration, Pope Benedict XVI adopted an earlier form of the pallium, from a period when it and the omophor were virtually identical. It is wider than the modern pallium although not as wide as the modern omophor, made of wool with black silk ends, and decorated with five red crosses, three of which are pierced with pins, symbolic of Christ&#x27;s five wounds and the three nails, and it was worn crossed over the left shoulder. Only the Papal pallium was to take this distinctive form. Beginning with the Solemnity of Saints Peter and Paul (June 29, 2008) Benedict XVI reverted to a form similar to that worn by his recent predecessors, albeit in a larger and longer cut and with red crosses, therefore remaining distinct from pallia worn by metropolitans. This change, explained the Master of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations Guido Marini, came about after recent studies on the history of the pallium had shown that the oldest depiction of a pope wearing that type of pallium, that of Pope Innocent III at the Sacro Speco Cloister, seemed to be a deliberate archaism. Marini also stated that Pope Benedict had had a series of annoying problems keeping it in place during liturgical celebrations. This pallium would later end up being worn by another pope when, while inspecting the damages caused by the 2009 L&#x27;Aquila earthquake Pope Benedict visited the badly stricken church of Santa Maria di Collemaggio. Here Pope Celestine V&#x27;s remains had survived the earthquake, and after praying for a few minutes by his tomb, Benedict left the pallium on Celestine&#x27;s glass casket. The last pope to abdicate willingly before Benedict XVI was Celestine V in 1294.
Although Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s second pallium was not actually made until 2008, the model for it already existed on his coat of arms. A precedent for Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s variations of the pallium was set in 1999 when Pope John Paul II wore a long Y-shaped pallium with red crosses for that year&#x27;s Easter and Christmas celebrations. It was only used on those occasions and was created by Piero Marini, the then-master of pontifical liturgical celebrations, who would also create Pope Benedict&#x27;s first pallium.

On June 29, 2014, after using Benedict XVI&#x27;s second pallium for more than a year, Pope Francis restored the traditional pallium worn by popes prior to Benedict.

In January 2015, Pope Francis announced that, from that year&#x27;s imposition on, the pallium would no longer be awarded personally by the Pope in Rome; instead, the corresponding archbishops would impose it in their local churches. The Pope, however, will continue to bless it beforehand.

== Style ==

There is a decided difference between the form of the modern pallium and that used in early Christian times, as portrayed in the Ravenna mosaics. The pallium of the sixth century was a long, moderately wide, white band of wool, ornamented at its extremity with a black or red cross, and finished off with tassels; it was draped around the neck, shoulders, and breast in such a manner that it formed a V in front, and the ends hung down from the left shoulder, one in front and one behind.

In the eighth century it became customary to let the ends fall down, one in the middle of the breast and the other in the middle of the back, and to fasten them there with pins, the pallium thus becoming Y-shaped. A further development took place during the ninth century (according to pictorial representations outside of Rome, in places where ancient traditions were not maintained so strictly): the band, which had hitherto been kept in place by the pins, was sewn Y-shaped, without, however, being cut.

The present circular form originated in the tenth or eleventh century. Two excellent early examples of this form, belonging respectively to Archbishop St. Heribert (1021) and Archbishop St. Anno (d. 1075), are preserved in Siegburg, Archdiocese of Cologne.

At first the only decorations on the pallium were two crosses near the extremities. This is proved by the mosaics at Ravenna and Rome. It appears that the ornamentation of the pallium with a greater number of crosses did not become customary until the ninth century, when small crosses were sewn on the pallium, especially over the shoulders. However, during the Middle Ages there was no definite rule regulating the number of crosses, nor was there any precept determining their colour. They were generally dark, but sometimes red. The pins, which at first served to keep the pallium in place, were retained as ornaments even after the pallium was sewn in the proper shape, although they no longer had any practical object. That the insertion of small leaden weights in the vertical ends of the pallium was usual as early as the thirteenth century is proved by the discovery in 1605 of the pallium enveloping the body of Boniface VIII, and by the fragments of the pallium found in the tomb of Clement IV.

== Significance ==
As early as the 6th century, the pallium was considered a liturgical vestment to be used only during Mass unless a special privilege determined otherwise, as evidenced by the correspondence between Pope Gregory I and John of Ravenna. The rules regulating the original use of the pallium cannot be determined with certainty, but its use, even before the 6th century, seems to have had a definite liturgical character. From early times more or less extensive restrictions limited the use of the pallium to certain days. Its indiscriminate use, permitted to Hincmar of Reims by Leo IV (851) and to Bruno of Cologne by Agapetus II (954) was contrary to the general custom. In the 10th and 11th centuries, just as today, the general rule was to limit the use of the pallium to a few festivals and some other extraordinary occasions. The symbolic character now attached to the pallium dates back to the 8th century, when it was made an obligation for all metropolitans to petition the Holy See for permission to use it. The evolution of this character was complete about the end of the eleventh century; thenceforth the pallium is always designated in the papal bulls as the symbol of &quot;plenitudo pontificalis officii&quot; (&quot;plenitude of pontifical office&quot;). In the sixth century the pallium was the symbol of the papal office and the papal power, and for this reason Pope Felix transmitted his pallium to his archdeacon, when, contrary to custom, he nominated him his successor. On the other hand, when used by metropolitans, the pallium originally signified simply union with the Apostolic See, and was an ornament symbolizing the virtue and rank of its wearer.

<doc id="147272" wikidata="Q242267" url="?curid=147272" title="Bardiya">
<text>Bardiya or Smerdis ( ; ; possibly died 522 BCE), also named as Tanyoxarces (; ) by Ctesias, was a son of Cyrus the Great and the younger brother of Cambyses II, both Persian kings. There are sharply divided views on his life. Bardiya either ruled the Achaemenid Empire for a few months in 522 BCE, or was impersonated by a magus called Gaumata ( ), whose name is given by Ctesias as Sphendadates (; ), until he was toppled by Darius the Great.

==Name and sources==
The prince&#x27;s name is listed variously in the historical sources. In Darius the Great&#x27;s Behistun inscription, his Persian name is Bardiya or Bardia. Herodotus calls him Smerdis, which is the prevalent Greek form of his name; the Persian name has been assimilated to the Greek (Asiatic) name &quot;Smerdis&quot; or &quot;Smerdies&quot;, a name which also occurs in the poems of Alcaeus and Anacreon. Bardiya is called &quot;Tanyoxarces&quot; by Ctesias, who also names Gaumāta as &quot;Sphendadates&quot;; he is called &quot;Tanooxares&quot; by Xenophon, who takes the name from Ctesias, and he is called &quot;Mergis&quot; and &quot;Merdis&quot; by Justin and &quot;Merdis&quot; by Aeschylus.

In English-language histories he has traditionally been called Smerdis, following Herodotus&#x27; example, but recent histories tend to call him Bardiya.

==Traditional view==

The traditional view is based on several ancient sources, including the Behistun inscription as well as Herodotus, in Ctesias, and Justin, although there are minor differences among them. The three oldest surviving sources agree that Gaumata/Pseudo-Smerdis/Sphendadates was overthrown by Darius and others in a coup d&#x27;état, and that Darius then ascended the throne. Most sources (including Darius himself, Herodotus and Ctesias) have Darius as part of a group of seven conspirators. In Greek and Latin sources, Darius subsequently gained kingship by cheating in a contest.

Bardiya was the younger son of Cyrus the Great and a full or half-brother of Cambyses II. According to Ctesias, on his deathbed Cyrus appointed Bardiya as satrap (governor) of some of the far-eastern provinces. According to Darius the Great, Cambyses II, after becoming king of Persia but before setting out for Egypt, killed Bardiya and kept this secret. However, according to Herodotus (who gives two detailed stories), Bardiya went to Egypt with Cambyses and was there for some time but later Cambyses sent him back to Susa out of envy, because &quot;Bardiya alone could draw the bow brought from the Ethiopian king.&quot; Herodotus then states that &quot;Cambyses had a dream in which he saw his brother sitting on the royal throne. As a result of this dream Cambyses sent his trusted counselor Prexaspes from Egypt to Susa with the order to kill Smerdis&quot; (i.e., Bardiya).

Bardiya&#x27;s death was not known to the people, and so in the spring of 522 BC, a usurper pretended to be him and proclaimed himself king on a mountain near the Persian town of Paishiyauvada. Darius claimed that the real name of the usurper was &quot;Gaumata&quot;, a Magian priest from Media; this name has been preserved by Justin but given to his brother (called &quot;Patizeithes&quot; by Herodotus), who is said to have been the real promoter of the intrigue. According to Herodotus, the name of the Magian usurper was &quot;Oropastes&quot;, but according to Ctesias it was &quot;Sphendadates&quot;.

The despotic rule of Cambyses, coupled with his long absence in Egypt, contributed to the fact that &quot;the whole people, Persians, Medes and all the other nations,&quot; acknowledged the usurper, especially as he granted a tax relief for three years.
Cambyses began to march against him, but died in the spring of 522 BC in disputed circumstances. Before his death he confessed to the murder of his brother, and publicly explained the whole fraud, but this was not generally believed. Nobody had the courage to oppose the new king, who ruled for seven months over the whole empire. The new king transferred the seat of government to Media. A number of Persian nobles discovered that their new ruler was an impostor, and a group of seven nobles formed a plot to kill him. They surprised him at a castle in Nisa, home of the Nisean horses, and stabbed him to death in September 522 BC. One of the seven, Darius, was proclaimed as ruler shortly after.

While the primary sources do not agree on the names and many other details, the three oldest surviving sources (Darius himself, Herodotus and Ctesias) all portray Gaumata/Pseudo-Smerdis/Sphendadates as an imposter who usurped the throne by posing as one of the sons of Cyrus the Great, i.e. as one of the brothers of Cambyses II. In Darius&#x27; trilingual Behistun inscription, the prince being impersonated is named &quot;Pirtiya&quot; in Elamite, &quot;Bardiya&quot; in Old Persian, and &quot;Barziya&quot; in Akkadian. In Herodotus&#x27; &quot;Histories&quot;, the prince and his imposter have the same name (Smerdis). For Ctesias, Sphendadates poses as &#x27;Tanyoxarces&#x27;. Other Greek sources have various other names for the figure being impersonated, including &#x27;Tanoxares&#x27;, &#x27;Mergis&#x27; and &#x27;Mardos&#x27;.

===In Herodotus&#x27; &quot;Histories&quot;===


A longer version of the story appears in Book 3 of Herodotus&#x27; &quot;Histories&quot;, written c. 450 BC. That story there (3.1–38, 3.61–88) can be roughly summarized as follows: While in Egypt, Cambyses wounds the thigh of the sacred bull worshipped as the god Apis, and when the sacred bull dies from the wound, Cambyses loses his already tenuous grasp on sanity (3.27–3.30). Jealous of his brother Smerdis&#x27; skill with a particular bow brought from the king of Ethiopia, Cambyses sends Smerdis back to Persis. Cambyses then has a dream in which Smerdis would supplant him, so he sends a henchman to murder him secretly (3.30). The assassination succeeds and is meant to be kept secret.

One of the few that know of Smerdis&#x27; death is Patizeithes, the steward of Cambyses&#x27; palace at Susa. That steward has a brother who greatly resembles Smerdis in appearance, and whose name is also Smerdis (3.61.1). The steward then puts his brother on the throne, and has him pretend that he is the brother of Cambyses. The false Smerdis succeeds in the deception by not allowing anyone who knew the real Smerdis into his presence (3.61).

Still in Egypt, Cambyses learns of the false Smerdis, and knowing that the real Smerdis is dead, recognises the deception. Cambyses then readies his army to return to Susa, but while mounting his horse accidentally injures his thigh with the point of his sword. Cambyses dies from the wound a few days later (3.63–3.66). On his death bed, Cambyses perceives Smerdis as favouring a return to Median hegemony (3.65). The false Smerdis then continues to rule at Susa for some time, and gains support from everyone except the Persians when he grants a three-year military draft and tax exemption to the various peoples of the empire (3.67).

Meanwhile, Otanes, a nobleman of Persis, suspects that the king is not the brother of Cambyses, but rather the Smerdis whose ears Cyrus had commanded be cut off &quot;for some grave reason&quot; (3.69.6). To confirm his suspicion, Otanes asks his daughter Phaidyme – who is a member of the harem and thus has access to the king – to check whether the man has ears. Phaidyme does as asked, and one night while the king is asleep, confirms that the king does not in fact have ears. His suspicions confirmed, Otanes then gathers six noblemen and plots to get rid of the false Smerdis. A seventh nobleman, Darius, arrives at the capital shortly thereafter, and is then included in the group. The seven conspirators charge into the chambers of the king, and while five deal with the guards, Darius and Megabyzus kill the false Smerdis and a companion.

Five days later, after the tumult has died down, the seven meet again to discuss a suitable form of government (3.80–82). After some discussion over the merits of democracy (proposed by Otanes) and oligarchy (proposed by Megabyzus) and monarchy (proposed by Darius), four of the seven vote in favour of a monarchy. They then decide to hold a contest whereby whichever of them got his horse to neigh first after sunrise shall become king. Darius cheats and ascends the throne (3.84–3.87).

===In Ctesias&#x27; &quot;Persica&quot;===

Ctesias&#x27; version (c. 400 BC) runs as follows (XI/F9.8 and XII/F13.11-17, via Photius &quot;Bibl&quot;. 72): King Cyrus, as he lay dying, appointed his elder son, Cambyses, to the throne and appointed his younger son, Tanyoxarces, governor of the provinces of Bactria, Chorasmia, Parthia, and Carmania. Shortly after Cambyses ascends the throne, a certain Sphendadates who had been whipped by Tanyoxarces for some offence, informs Cambyses that his brother is plotting against him. As proof of this he declares that Tanyoxarces would refuse to come if summoned.

When Tanyoxarces does not immediately accede to the summons, Cambyses begins to believe Sphendadates, who then begins to slander Tanyoxarces more freely. By the time Tanyoxarces finally arrives, Cambyses is determined to put him to death, but hesitates. Sphendadates suggests that, since he (Sphendadates) looks very much like Tanyoxarces, he could take the prince&#x27;s place. Cambyses agrees, and Tanyoxarces is killed by being forced to drink bull&#x27;s blood. Sphendadates then takes the place as governor of the eastern provinces.

Five years later, while in Babylon, Cambyses accidentally wounds himself in the thigh, and dies eleven days later. Upon hearing of Cambyses death, Sphendadates (alias Tanyoxarces) returns to the capital and succeeds Cambyses. Meanwhile, Izabates, a confidant of Cambyses who knew of the killing of Tanyoxarces, is on his way with the body of Cambyses. Upon arriving at the capital and finding Sphendadates on the throne, Izabates exposes the fraud. Then, seven noblemen (among them Darius) conspire against Sphendadates. The seven are admitted to the palace by a co-conspirator, where Sphendadates is then killed. The seven then decide to hold a contest whereby whichever of them got his horse to neigh first after sunrise shall become king. Darius gets his horse to be the first to neigh (F13.17: &quot;the result of a cunning stratagem&quot;) and he ascends the throne.

== Modern view ==

Most modern historians do not consider Darius&#x27; version of events convincing, and assume that the person who ruled for a few months was the real son of Cyrus, and that the story of his impersonation by a magus was an invention of Darius to justify his seizure of the throne.

The key argument against a fabrication is that there is no evidence for it, and lacking further discoveries that view &quot;must remain hypothetical&quot;. However, the idea that Gaumata was a fabrication is nonetheless appealing because &quot;it was vital for a man like Darius, who had no particular rights to the throne, to invent a character (Gaumata) condemned for his acts against gods and men.&quot; There are some implausibilities in the official story, e.g. the impostor resembled the real Bardiya so closely that most of his wives did not spot the difference, except for queen Phaidyme. Darius often accused rebels and opponents of being impostors (such as Nebuchadnezzar III) and it could be straining credibility to say that they all were.

== Aftermath ==
In the next year, another person claiming to be Bardiya, named Vahyazdāta () rose against Darius in eastern Persia and met with great success, but he was finally defeated, taken prisoner and executed. Perhaps he is identical with the King Maraphis &quot;the Maraphian,&quot; name of a Persian tribe, who occurs as successor in the list of Persian kings given by Aeschylus.

The real Bardiya had only one daughter, called Parmys, who eventually married Darius the Great.

Some contracts dating from his reign have been found in Babylonia, where his name is spelt &quot;Barziya&quot; or &quot;Bardiya&quot;. Darius says that Bardiya destroyed some temples, which Darius later restored. Bardiya also took away the herds and houses of the people, which Darius corrected once he gained the throne.

The death of the false Bardiya was annually celebrated in Persia by a feast called &quot;the killing of the magian,&quot; (&quot;Magiophani&quot;) at which no magian was allowed to show himself.

==Bardiya in fiction==
This episode is dealt with by Gore Vidal in his novel &quot;Creation&quot;. He takes the view that the person who ruled for a few months was the real Bardiya.

&quot;The impostor Magian Smerdis&quot; is mentioned in the short story by Jorge Luis Borges, &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot;. He is the only historical character that the protagonist is able to recognize when discovering the article on the fictitious nation of Uqbar, and it is stated that his name has been invoked mainly as a metaphor.

<text>The Shrine of the Three Kings (German &quot;Dreikönigsschrein&quot; or &quot;Der Dreikönigenschrein&quot;), Tomb of the Three Kings, or Tomb of the Three Magi is a reliquary traditionally believed to contain the bones of the Biblical Magi, also known as the Three Kings or the Three Wise Men. This shrine is a large gilded and decorated triple sarcophagus situated above and behind the high altar of Cologne Cathedral in western Germany. Built approximately from 1180 to 1225, it is considered the high point of Mosan art by various historians and scholars, and ranks amongst the largest reliquary in the Western world.

The shrine has gone through periods of damage and restoration during the 16th century. Although the shrine has always been on display, it was not until the 19th century when the relics were unveiled to the public. The relics of the three kings were first exhibited to public display in the 12th century.

Adorned with intricate decorations, the shrine&#x27;s surfaces narrate the stories of the three Magi, the Virgin Mary, and the life of Christ. These narratives are depicted with figures meticulously rendered gold-plated silver.

The &quot;relics of the Magi&quot; were originally brought to Constantinople by Empress Helena, Constantine the Great&#x27;s mother, then brought to Milan in an oxcart by Eustorgius I, the city&#x27;s bishop, to whom they were entrusted by Constantine in 314. Eight centuries later in 1164, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa took the relics of the Magi from the church of Saint Eustorgio in Milan and gave them to the Archbishop of Cologne, Rainald of Dassel, who was also the imperial Archchancellor of Italy. In 1164, Rainald transferred these relics to Cologne where the shrine for the three kings was built. Their bones were wrapped in white silk and returned to the shrine. The relics have since attracted a constant stream of pilgrims to Cologne.

Parts of the shrine were designed by the famous medieval goldsmith Nicholas of Verdun, who began to work on it in 1180. It was completed circa 1225. Other parts of the shrine were decorated during the time of Archbishop Philip von Hensberg with additional jewels and gold placed on it. Scholar Lisa Victoria Ciresi notes that these precious jewels are said to evoke images of the Heavenly Jerusalem.

Around 1199, King Otto IV gave three golden crowns, purported to be made for the three wise men, as a present to the cathedral of Cologne. Because of the importance of the shrine and the cathedral for the later development of the city, the coat of arms of Cologne still shows these three crowns symbolizing the Three Kings. Hugo Stehkämper theorizes that King Otto IV of Brunswick was often depicted as the fourth king. He ascended to the throne in 1198 and became Holy Roman Emperor in 1209. He donated all of the materials that were needed to complete the shrine. On the shrine, he is depicted in the procession behind the Magi with inscription that labels him: &quot;Otto Rex.&quot; Although King Otto IV offered the three kings the gold crowns, he, himself, does not wear one with them in his depiction on the shrine. Jūrgen Petersohn writes that King Otto IV wanted to be seen as having equal rank with the Three Magis, thus, he joins in on the Adoration of Christ.

Construction of the present Cologne Cathedral begun in 1248 to house these important relics. The cathedral took 632 years to complete and is now the largest Gothic church in northern Europe.

=== Disturbances and preservations ===
The shrine has undergone numerous disturbances and recoveries; however, aside from what was already lost, the shrine remains lavishly preserved. The last restoration of the shrine took place between 1961 and 1973 after it was removed during World War II from the cathedral.

The shrine has been carefully preserved by an &quot;officiate&quot; or &quot;custodes regum&quot; that made it possible for the relics to remain in good condition for five hundred years. However, Renaissance collectors highly valued the gems on the shrine, making the shrine a target for robbery. On January 28 of 1574, several gems and pearls along with a large cameo were stolen from the trapezoid plate of the shrine.

==== Ptolemy cameo ====
On January 28, 1574, the highly decorative parts of the shrine were stolen, including the Ptolemy cameo, from the trapezoid plate. The thief looted the shrine at a time when the priest celebrated mass and his back faced the laity. Unfortunately, the gems and jewels have never been recovered, nor has the identity of the thief been found. 

The stolen cameo, an Indian sardonyx with seventeen layers, eleven of which were used for engraving, was said to have two heads on it, and the measurement was about the size of a hand. The two heads represent the portrait of Ptolemy II and his wife, Arsinoë II. It was created during the Hellenistic period, 3rd century, in Egypt.

Albertus Magnus described the appearance of the stolen cameo in a note. In October 1586, the cameo was later offered in Rome to Fulvio Orsini, a Flemish dealer. It was discovered to have been fractured during the times of the robbery, but it was repaired with an armored piece called a gorget, which was made of steel or leather, and a golden frame. From 1586 onward, it has not been returned to the shrine, rather, it resides in the imperial collection at Vienna, which was confirmed by Clifford Brown.

=== Nineteenth-century history ===
On 20 July 1864, the shrine was opened, revealing human remains and the coins of Philip I, Archbishop of Cologne. An eyewitness report reads:

:&quot;In a special compartment of the shrine now there showed – along with remains of ancient old rotten or moulded bandages, most likely byssus, besides pieces of aromatic resins and similar substances – numerous bones of three persons, which under the guidance of several present experts could be assembled into nearly complete bodies: the one in his early youth, the second in his early manhood, the third was rather aged. Two coins, bracteates made of silver and only one side stricken, were adjoined; one, probably from the days of &quot;Philipps von Heinsberg&quot;, displayed a church (&quot;See Note&quot;), the other showed a cross, accompanied by the sword of jurisdiction, and the crosier (bishop&#x27;s crook) on either side.&quot;
&quot;Note&quot;: &quot;Just as the coin of Philipp in &quot;Hartzheim, historia rei nummariae coloniensis&quot; Table 3 No. 14, 16, (1754), yet without its circumscription; the other (coin) is in square form, showed in the center a cross, accompanied by the sword of jurisdiction, and the crosier (bishop&#x27;s crook) on either side, also without transcription, most certainly it is not younger and can be assumed perhaps to turn out to be a coin by Rainald [of Dassel].&quot;

== Identity of the Three Magi ==
Images of the three Kings are located in the bottom middle of the sanctuary, offering gifts in this order according to the Gospel of Matthew: gold, frankincense, and myrrh, to Mary on the throne holding infant Jesus. These ventured to Bethlehem from the east where Christ was born after seeing a star. The identities of these Magi are in the order they appear on the shrine as golden figures: Caspar, Melchior, Balthasar. Melchior, shown on the shrine with a long beard, is the oldest of the three. He is King of Persia, and was given the gift of gold to give the Christ Child. Balthasar, depicted as an old Middle Eastern or Black man with African features on the shrine, was the King of Arabia or sometimes Ethiopia; he is giving the gift of myrrh to the Christ Child. Lastly, Caspar (or Gaspar) was the youngest of the three, and shown with a short beard on the shrine; he was given the gift of frankincense to give the Christ child.

==Description==

===Size and construction===
The Shrine of the Three Kings is approximately wide, high, and long. It is shaped like a basilica: two sarcophagi stand next to each other, with the third sarcophagus resting on their roof ridges. The ends are completely covered, so there is no space visible between the sarcophagi. The basic structure is made of wood, with gold and silver overlay decorated with filigree, enamel, and over 1,000 jewels and beads. The latter include a large number of cameos and intaglio pieces, some pre-Christian.

===Decoration===
The entire outside of the shrine is covered with an elaborate decorative overlay. There are 74 high relief figures in silver-gilt in all, not counting smaller additional figures in the background decoration. On the sides, images of the prophets decorate the lower part, while images of the apostles and evangelists decorate the upper part. It contains 304 engraved gems, where 142 of these gems have belonged to its initial embellishments. It is encircled by offertory candles and by twenty-four lamps. A grand chandelier hangs above the shrine that symbolizes the Heavenly Jerusalem.

A removable trapezoid allows the viewer to see the relics through a latticed opening. Supported by angels and dominating the center until 1574 was the large Ptolemy cameo. The function of these angels were to have been the holy messengers of God the Father when they were seen beside Christ holding a chalice, paten, and diadem.

==== Front ====
The front of the shrine, completed sometime after 1200, resembles that of a cathedral with a high central midpoint. The figures located here are made of pure gold. This area contains the most precious gems, though they had been stolen in the 16th century. Across the bottom, from left to right, are images of the Adoration of the Magi, the Virgin Mary enthroned with the infant Jesus, and the Baptism of Christ, and above, Christ enthroned at the Last Judgment. A removable filigree panel reveals a grille displaying the names of Caspar, Melchior, and Balthasar. When the grille is removed, the skulls of the three Magi are shown wearing crowns.

The present front has been remodeled since the original design made by Nicolas of Verdun. However, the original plan for it is unknown. The Ptolemy cameo, the angels, and the row of crowns in the spandrels have been cleared away; however, the figure of Otto IV remains unchanged except for his little gold box that he is holding.

==== Back ====
The back is similar in appearance to the two reliquaries on top. The relics of the three Kings are arranged in the bottom part of the shrine whereas martyrs Felix and Nabor are located in the smaller upper part. There are 74 high relief figures in silver-gilt in all, not counting smaller additional figures in the background decoration. The surface is divided into 3 zones: lower, middle and upper zones. The standing figure of Jeremiah separates the events of Flagellation and Crucifixion in the lower zone. Above the lower zone, the middle zone, contains the portrait bust of Rainald of Dassel, the Archbishop of Cologne. In the upper zone, the resurrected Christ is seen crowning the martyrs Felix and Nabor. Christ in Majesty is shown holding the Book of Life in his left hand whilst his right hand is held high for an act of judgment. The inscription reads along the inner band of the gable:

&quot;ADVENIO DIGNOS SALVARE FERIRE MALIGNOS ERGO BONI METITE FELICIA GAVDIA VITE ITE REI VOS IRA DEI TRANSMITTIT IN IGNem QUISQue METIT QUOD ProMERVIT SUB IUDICE IVSTO.&quot;

==== Sides ====
On the lateral sides, there are two series of aches that join the upper and lower levels. The figures of the prophets decorate the lower part, while the apostles and evangelists decorate the upper part, are all identified by their inscriptions and made of gilded silver. A cherub whose name is Plentinudo Scientiae (Abundant Wisdom) is seated in the middle of the apostles, while a seraph named Ardens Caritate (Ardent Sacred Love) sits on the other side.

=== Mosan art ===

Mosan art (Latin name Mosa meaning &quot;Meuse&quot;) is a regional style drawing from Carolingian art, mostly produced in the Meuse river valley, during the 12th and 13th centuries. The Meuse valley is in present-day Belgium, Netherlands, and Germany. The elaborate metalwork on the shrine was made by Nicholas of Verdun, from Verdun, now in France, a small city on the banks of the Meuse River. The enamel panels depict Biblical narratives and iconographies of the life of Christ, the Virgin Mary, various saints and the Biblical Magi. Sculptural elements are seen on the shrine&#x27;s figures. Mosan artists used techniques such as champlevé enamel, filigree, and cloisonné in their works.

<text>Semiramis (; &quot;Šammīrām&quot;, &quot;Šamiram&quot;, , &quot;Samīrāmīs&quot;) was the legendary Lydian-Babylonian wife of Onnes and of Ninus, who succeeded the latter on the throne of Assyria, according to Movses Khorenatsi. Legends narrated by Diodorus Siculus, who drew primarily from the works of Ctesias of Cnidus, describe her and her relationships to Onnes and King Ninus.

Armenians and the Assyrians of Iraq, northeast Syria, southeast Turkey, and northwest Iran still use &quot;Shamiram&quot; and its derivative &quot;Samira&quot; as a given name for girls.

The real and historical [[Shammuramat]], the original Akkadian form of the name, was the Assyrian wife of Shamshi-Adad V (ruled 824 BC–811 BC). She ruled the Neo-Assyrian Empire as its regent for five years, before her son Adad-nirari III came of age and took the reins of power. She ruled at a time of political uncertainty, which may partly explain why Assyrians may have accepted the rule of a woman when it was not allowed by their cultural tradition. She conquered much of the Middle East and the Levant and stabilized and strengthened the empire after a destructive civil war. It has been speculated that being a woman who ruled successfully may have made the Assyrians regard her with particular reverence and that her achievements may have been retold over the generations until she was gradually turned into a legendary figure.

The name of Semiramis came to be applied to various monuments in Western Asia and Anatolia whose origins had been forgotten or unknown, even the Behistun Inscription of Darius. Herodotus ascribes to her the artificial banks that confined the Euphrates. He knew her name because it was inscribed on a gate of Babylon. Various places in Mesopotamia, Media, Persia, the Levant, Anatolia, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Caucasus received names recalling Semiramis.

== Historical figure ==
While the achievements of Semiramis are clearly in the realm of mythical Persian, Armenian, and Greek historiography, the historical Shammuramat certainly existed. After her husband&#x27;s death, she might have served as regent for her son, Adad-nirari III. Thus, during that time Shammuramat could have been in control of the vast Neo-Assyrian Empire (911–605 BC), which stretched from the Caucasus Mountains in the north to the Arabian Peninsula in the south, and from western Iran in the east to Cyprus in the west.

In the city of Aššur on the Tigris, she had an obelisk built and inscribed that read, &quot;Stele of Shammuramat, queen of Shamshi-Adad, King of the Universe, King of Assyria, Mother of Adad Nirari, King of the Universe, King of Assyria, Daughter-in-Law of Shalmaneser, King of the Four Regions of the World.&quot;

== Legend according to Diodorus Siculus ==
According to Diodorus, a first century BC Greek historian, Semiramis was of noble parents, the daughter of the fish-goddess Derketo of Ascalon and of a mortal. He related that Derketo abandoned her at birth and drowned herself. Doves fed the child until Simmas, the royal shepherd, found her. Semiramis married Onnes or Menones, a general under King Ninus, and she became an advisor to the king. Her advice led him to great successes. At the Siege of Bactra, she personally led a party of soldiers to seize a key defensive point, leading to the capture of the city.

Ninus was so struck that he fell in love with her. He tried to compel Onnes to give her to him as a wife, first offering his own daughter Sonanê in return and eventually threatening to put out his eyes as punishment. Out of fear of the king, and out of doomed passion for his wife, Onnes &quot;fell into a kind of frenzy and madness&quot; and hanged himself. Ninus then married Semiramis.

Diodorus relates that after their marriage, Semiramis and Ninus had a son named Ninyas. After King Ninus conquered Asia, including the Bactrians, Ninus was fatally wounded by an arrow. Semiramis disguised herself as her son so the army would follow her instructions, thinking they came from their new ruler. Diodorus writes that her reign lasted for 42 years and that she conquered much of Asia and achieved many feats. She restored ancient Babylon and protected it with a high brick wall that completely surrounded the city. She built several palaces in Persia, including Ecbatana.

She ruled Asia effectively and added Libya and Aethiopia to the empire. She went to war with King Stabrobates (Supratika) of India, having her artisans build an army of military dummies in the form of false elephants by putting manipulated skins of dark-skinned buffaloes over her camels to deceive the Indians into thinking she had acquired real elephants. This ploy succeeded initially, but she was wounded in the counterattack and her army mainly annihilated, forcing the surviving remnants to re-ford the Indus and retreat to the west.

Diodorus mistakenly attributed the Behistun Inscription to her; it is now known to have been produced by Darius the Great. Diodorus could be referring to the nearby Anubanini rock relief which shows the goddess Ishtar dragging captives towards King Anubanini, he may have mistook Ishtar for Semiramis and Anubanini for Ninus. The writings of Diodorus about Semiramis are strongly influenced by the writings of Ctesias of Cnidus, although his writings about Semiramis do not always follow those by Ctesias.

== Other ancient traditions ==

Legends describing Semiramis have been recorded by approximately 80 ancient writers including Plutarch, Eusebius, Polyaenus, Valerius Maximus, Orosius, and Justinus. She was associated with Ishtar and Astarte since the time before Diodorus. The association of the fish and dove is found at Hierapolis Bambyce (Mabbog, now Manbij), the great temple that according to one legend, was founded by Semiramis, where her statue was shown with a golden dove on her head.

The name of Semiramis came to be applied to various monuments in Western Asia and Anatolia, the origins of which ancient writers sometimes asserted had been forgotten or unknown. Various places in Assyria and throughout Mesopotamia as a whole, Media, Persia, the Levant, Anatolia, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Caucasus bore the name of Semiramis in slightly changed forms, even some named during the Middle Ages. She is credited with founding the city of Van in Turkey in order to have a summer residence and that city may be found referred to as &quot;Shamiramagerd&quot; (city of Semiramis). 

Herodotus, an ancient Greek writer, geographer, and historian living from 484 to 425 BC, ascribes to Semiramis the artificial banks that confined the Euphrates and knows her name as borne by a gate of Babylon. Strabo, a Greek geographer, philosopher, and historian who lived in Asia Minor during 64 or 63 BC to 24 AD, credits her with building earthworks and other structures &quot;throughout almost the whole continent&quot;. Nearly every stupendous work of antiquity by the Euphrates or in Iran seems to have been ascribed to Semiramis, even the Behistun Inscription of Darius.

Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus (), who wrote the penultimate major historical account surviving from antiquity, credits her as the first person to castrate a male youth into eunuch-hood: &quot;Semiramis, that ancient queen who was the first person to castrate male youths of tender age&quot;.

Armenian tradition portrays Semiramis negatively, possibly because of a victorious military campaign she waged against them. One of the most popular legends in Armenian tradition involves Semiramis and an Armenian king, Ara the Handsome. According to that legend, Semiramis had fallen in love with the handsome Armenian King Ara and asked him to marry her. When he refused, in her passion she gathered the armies of Assyria and marched against Armenia.

During the battle Semiramis was victorious, but Ara was slain despite her orders to capture him alive. This legend continues that to avoid continuous warfare with the Armenians, Semiramis, who they alleged was a sorceress, took his body and prayed to deities to raise Ara from the dead. When the Armenians advanced to avenge their leader, she disguised one of her lovers as Ara and spread the rumor that the deities had brought Ara back to life, reportedly, convincing the Armenians not to continue the war.

In one persistent tradition in this vein, the prayers of Semiramis are successful and Ara returns to life. During the nineteenth century, it was reported that a village called Lezk, near Van in Turkey, traditionally held that it was the location of the resurrection of Ara.

==In later traditions==
Although negative portrayals did exist, generally, Semiramis was viewed positively before the rise of Christianity. During the Middle Ages, she became associated with promiscuity and lustfulness. One story claimed that she had an incestuous relationship with her son, justified it by passing a law to legitimize parent-child marriages, and invented the chastity belt to deter any romantic rivals before he eventually killed her. This seems to have appeared first in the reign of Augustus in the Universal History of Pompeius Trogus, which survives only in the later epitome of Justinius; the circulation of the story was likely popularized in the fifth century by Orosius in his universal history, &quot;Seven Books of History Against the Pagans&quot;, which has been described as an &quot;anti-pagan polemic&quot;.

In the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; (&quot;Inferno&quot; V), Dante places Semiramis among the souls of the lustful in the Second Circle of Hell. She appears in Petrarch&#x27;s &quot;Triumph of Love&quot; (canto III, verse 76). She is one of three women exemplifying &quot;evil love&quot;, the other two being Byblis and Myrrha. She is included in &quot;De Mulieribus Claris&quot;, a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio that was composed in 13611362. It is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature. Semiramis always was admired for her martial and political achievements.

Her reputation partly recovered in the late Middle Ages and Renaissance. She was included in Christine de Pizan&#x27;s &quot;The Book of the City of Ladies&quot;, finished by 1405, and, starting in the fourteenth century, she was commonly found on the Nine Worthies list for women.

== Literary references ==
Semiramis appears in many plays, such as Voltaire&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Sémiramis&quot; and Pedro Calderón de la Barca&#x27;s drama &quot;La hija del aire&quot;, and in operas by dozens of composers including Antonio Vivaldi, Christoph Willibald Gluck, Domenico Cimarosa, Josef Mysliveček, Giacomo Meyerbeer, and Gioachino Rossini. Arthur Honegger composed music for Paul Valéry&#x27;s 1934 &quot;ballet-pantomime&quot; &quot;Semiramis&quot;, which was revived in 1992 after many years of neglect. 

In Eugène Ionesco&#x27;s play &quot;The Chairs&quot;, the Old Woman character is referred to as Semiramis.
Semiramis was mentioned by William Shakespeare in &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; (II.1) and &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; (Ind.2). Portrayal of Semiramis has been used as a metaphor for female rulership. Sometimes she was referenced during political disputes regarding rule by women, both as an unfavorable comparison, for example, against Elizabeth I of England, and as an example of a woman who governed well. Powerful female monarchs Margaret I of Denmark and Catherine the Great were given the designation Semiramis of the North.

The mother of the sultan in &quot;The Man of Law&#x27;s Tale&quot; in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; is compared to Semiramis, with the intention of suggesting that the mother of the sultan is an evil woman just like Semiramis.

In the twentieth century, Semiramis has appeared in several sword and sandal films. She was portrayed by Rhonda Fleming in &quot;Queen of Babylon&quot; (1954) and by Yvonne Furneaux in &quot;I am Semiramis&quot; (1963).

== The Two Babylons ==

Despite a lack of supporting evidence in the Bible, the book &quot;The Two Babylons&quot; (1853), by the Christian minister Alexander Hislop, was particularly influential in characterizing Semiramis as the Whore of Babylon. Hislop claimed that Semiramis invented polytheism and, with it, goddess worship. He claimed that the head of the Catholic Church inherited and continued to propagate a millennia-old secret conspiracy, founded by Semiramis and the Biblical king Nimrod, to propagate the pagan religion of ancient Babylon. Grabbe and others have rejected the allegations in this book as based on a flawed understanding of the texts, but variations of them are accepted among some groups of evangelical Protestants.

Hislop asserted that Semiramis was a queen consort and the mother of Nimrod, builder of the Bible&#x27;s Tower of Babel. He said that Semiramis and Nimrod&#x27;s incestuous male offspring was the Akkadian deity Tammuz, and that all divine pairings in religions were retellings of this story. These claims are still circulated among some groups of evangelical Protestants, in the form of Jack Chick tracts, comic books, and related media.

Critics have dismissed the speculations by Hislop as based on misunderstandings.

Lester L. Grabbe has claimed that Hislop&#x27;s argument, particularly his identification of Ninus with Nimrod, is based on a misunderstanding of historical Babylon and its religion. Grabbe criticized Hislop for portraying Semiramis as Nimrod&#x27;s consort, despite that she has not been found in a single text associated with him, and for portraying her as the &quot;mother of harlots&quot;, even though this is not how she is depicted in any of the historical texts where she is mentioned.

Ralph Woodrow also has been critical of this interpretation and has stated that Alexander Hislop &quot;picked, chose and mixed&quot; portions of various myths from different cultures.

<doc id="147278" wikidata="Q859230" url="?curid=147278" title="Cedar Point">
<text>Cedar Point is a amusement park located on a Lake Erie peninsula in Sandusky, Ohio, United States, owned and operated by Six Flags. It opened in 1870 and is considered the second-oldest operating amusement park in the US behind Lake Compounce. Prior to the merger with Six Flags in 2024, Cedar Point served as the &quot;flagship park&quot; of the Cedar Fair amusement park chain and hosted the corporate headquarters. Known as &quot;America&#x27;s Roller Coast&quot;, the park features 17 roller coasters, which ranks third among amusement parks in North America behind sister parks Canada&#x27;s Wonderland (19) and Six Flags Magic Mountain (20). 

Cedar Point&#x27;s normal operating season runs from early May until Labor Day in September, which is followed by weekend-only operation through Halloween during an annual event known as HalloWeekends. Other amenities and attractions featured within the park include a beach, an outdoor water park named Cedar Point Shores, an indoor water park named Castaway Bay, two marinas, and an outdoor sports complex called Cedar Point Sports Center.

The park has reached numerous milestones over the years, including one in which Cedar Point became the only amusement park in the world with five roller coasters that exceed in height – Magnum XL-200, Millennium Force, Valravn, Steel Vengeance, and Top Thrill 2 – as well as the only park with roller coasters in all four height classifications. Cedar Point also received the Golden Ticket Award for &quot;Best Amusement Park in the World&quot; from &quot;Amusement Today&quot; for sixteen consecutive years from 1997 to 2013. Among seasonal amusement parks in North America, Cedar Point consistently ranks as the second-most visited behind only Canada&#x27;s Wonderland, with an estimated 3.44 million visitors in 2022. In addition, several of its buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
In the late-19th century, the south shore region of Lake Erie became a popular vacation destination for the emerging middle-class in the United States. The Lake&#x27;s islands, such as Kelleys Island and South Bass Island, were gaining a reputation for their freshwater bathing resorts. The Cedar Point peninsula, named for its abundance of cedar trees, was originally known for its fishing. Local fishermen leased land and built living quarters there. Sandusky, which featured an important shipping harbor and two railroads, transformed into a major economic center over the next three decades. Railroad and steamship travel supported an emerging tourism industry, and rapid development of the area began.
In the 1860s during the American Civil War, housing for a battery of four field artillery pieces was constructed at the tip of the peninsula. It was used to defend a prison for Confederate soldiers on nearby Johnson&#x27;s Island. Louis Zistel, a German immigrant, built two boats to transport the prisoners. In 1870, he began to ferry locals to the Cedar Point peninsula, which opened as a public bathing beach. Zistel opened a bathhouse on the north shore of the peninsula and the same year built a beer garden with a small dance floor. He charged 25 cents per person to ride from Sandusky to Cedar Point on his boat, &quot;Young Reindeer&quot;, widely recognized as the beginning of commercial tourism on the Cedar Point peninsula.

In 1878, James West opened a group of bathhouses near the beach. By 1880, a local newspaper had observed that the popularity of the beach was increasing, with picnicking on the grounds becoming a popular pastime. The popularity of the peninsula attracted the attention of Benjamin F. Dwelle and Captain William Slackford, who leased land on the peninsula in 1882 and built eight new bathhouses, a dance hall, and wooden walkways on the beach. The steamboats &quot;R.B. Hayes&quot; and &quot;Lutts&quot; provided transport to Biemiller&#x27;s Cove and Cedar Point Light. Building on early success, Dwelle and Slackford continued to expand the offerings for their visitors each year and added picnic tables, cleared acres of brush, and built a baseball diamond.

After Slackford became ill in 1888, Dwelle entered into a more lucrative partnership with Adam Stoll and Louis Adolph, who owned land at Cedar Point, along with investors Charles Baetz and Jacob Kuebeler. The partnership&#x27;s first venture was constructing a Grand Pavilion, which opened the same year in 1888 and marked the first concerted effort to operate the peninsula as a public resort. It was a two-story theater and concert hall with a bowling alley and photographer&#x27;s studio. The building was recognized for its unusual architecture and still stands in the park. The first amusement ride at Cedar Point, a water toboggan ride consisting of a ramp that launched riders into Lake Erie, opened in 1890. Electricity was installed at Cedar Point in 1891. The first roller coaster, Switchback Railway, opened the following year. It stood high and had a top speed of . The Switchback Railway was designed as two identical tracks side-by-side – one for the ride down and the other for the train to be hauled back to the top by the ride attendant.

===Boeckling era===

Representatives of the Lake Erie and Western Railroad purchased the peninsula for in 1897 and formed the Cedar Point Pleasure Resort Company. The company appointed George A. Boeckling, a businessman from Indiana, as the park&#x27;s new manager. Under his tenure, the peninsula was transformed from a picnic ground into a nationally recognized amusement park and resort destination.

The second roller coaster at Cedar Point, the Figure-Eight Roller Toboggan, debuted in 1902. It was moved several years later and renamed The Racer. A pony track was built near the beach the same year. Mosquitos were an issue, so in 1904, the park hired the Detroit Dredging Company to drain swampy areas on the peninsula, thereby connecting a series of lagoons to form a water passageway that quickly became one of the park&#x27;s signature attractions. Aside from sightseeing passenger boats, the passageway was used to transport coal to power plants near the center of the peninsula. The historic Hotel Breakers opened in 1905 as one of the largest hotels in the Midwest; it had 600 guest rooms and a cafe that could seat 400 guests. A new area of the park called &quot;Amusement Circle&quot; was designed in 1906 to link the pier to the beach. It was located southeast of the Coliseum, a large arena built the same year that featured a grand ballroom and other attractions.
The Dip the Dips Scenic Railway roller coaster opened in 1908, but it was soon overshadowed by the larger Leap the Dips ride that opened in 1912. In 1917, Dip the Dips was razed and replaced by the Leap Frog Scenic Railway. With a growing assortment of rides including three roller coasters, Cedar Point was beginning to grow as an amusement park. However, that wasn&#x27;t a priority for Boeckling. He marketed the peninsula primarily as a bathing resort complete with shows, exhibits, motion pictures, and other forms of entertainment, but did not place emphasis on the park&#x27;s rides.

Several additional hotels and restaurants were constructed in the remaining years of Boeckling&#x27;s tenure, including Hotel Cedars, White House Hotel, Crystal Rock Castle and Crystal Gardens Ballroom. Cedar Point continued to update its ride attractions, replacing the Racer, the Circle Swing, and other rides to make way for a Shoot-the-Chutes water ride, a Tilt-A-Whirl, and fun houses such as Noah&#x27;s Ark and Bluebeard&#x27;s Palace. The Cyclone, a wooden roller coaster, opened in 1929. Boeckling, who was still attempting to expand the park, died from uremia on July 24, 1931.
===After Boeckling: the George A. Roose era===
Edward Smith took over Cedar Point&#x27;s management after Boeckling&#x27;s death. As a result of the Great Depression, little expansion happened through the 1930s. One of the few rides built in during this time was the Tumble Bug. The decaying Leap the Dips coaster was demolished in the mid-1930s. In the late 1930s, the resort was on the brink of being sold to the state of Ohio for . After the 1938 season, the directors had the second floor of the Coliseum modernized in the art deco style with a new stage. In the middle, the giant dance floor remained. Some of the top bands of the time played in the ballroom. As a result, it kept Cedar Point operating through the rest of the Depression. Momma Berardi&#x27;s Home Made French Fries came to Cedar Point, Momma Berardi&#x27;s family played an important role in the food industry at Cedar Point. Momma Berardi&#x27;s fries were sold there from 1942 until 1978, winning four Reader&#x27;s Choice Awards.

By the end of World War II, Cedar Point was in need of financial help. The wood of the Cyclone roller coaster was rotting, the boardwalk was cracked in many places, and the fishing dock was in need of repair. In 1946, Cedar Point&#x27;s oldest still-existing ride, the Midway Carousel, was installed. By 1951, the Cyclone coaster was razed because of its poor condition, leaving the resort without a roller coaster. As the Cyclone was being removed, the Laff-in-the-Dark, Rocket Ships, and Loop-A-Plane attractions were installed. Cedar Point Causeway was built in 1957 and is still in use. The president of Cedar Point, Bernie Zeiher, was replaced by George Roose around 1958, and Emile Legros was elected chairman that same year.
In the 1950s, the Pagoda Gift Shop was a post-office and the Crystal Rock Castle was turned into a maintenance shop in the late-1950s. In 1959, the hotels were repainted, new admission gates were installed, and over was spent to refresh Cedar Point. The park&#x27;s first roller coaster since the Cyclone, the Wild Mouse, was built. The resort also got a new kind of ride, a monorail, that was the most popular ride in 1959. Breakers Hotel was restored and the neglected cottages were demolished. The Coliseum and Grand Pavilion were both painted and remodeled. The Crystal Rock Castle Maintenance Shop, bathhouses, and the old powerhouse were demolished, and a new $50,000 bathhouse, boiler house, and maintenance shop were built in their place.

In the 1960s, the idea of &quot;pay one price&quot; season passes became common. On March 28, 1960, Cedar Point announced plans to transform the park into a &quot;Disneyland&quot; amusement center. Those plans fell through, however. &quot;Cedar Point &amp; Lake Erie Railroad&quot; opened in 1963, transporting passengers from the middle of the park to the back. In 1964, Cedar Point built its oldest surviving roller coaster, the Blue Streak. It was named after the local high school&#x27;s sports teams, the Sandusky Blue Streaks. Jungle Larry&#x27;s Safari Island was a well-known attraction that operated from 1965 until 1994 despite the death of Jungle Larry in 1984. The Cedar Creek Mine Ride opened in 1969; it is currently the second oldest roller coaster at Cedar Point.

In 1970, the Centennial Theatre, named in honor of Cedar Point&#x27;s 100th anniversary, was built. 1972 brought Giant Wheel and the now-defunct Jumbo Jet coaster. During the summer of 1974, Cedar Point reached an agreement with Marriott Corporation to be acquired in a stock-trade, where Roose and Legros would receive Marriott stock in exchange for Cedar Point stock. At the time, Marriott was expanding into the theme park business with locations in Illinois and California. The agreement was short lived as the deal was called off by Labor Day of that year. Around the same time, Cedar Point acquired property in the Irish Hills of Michigan in an attempt to build a second amusement park. The project was eventually cancelled due to local opposition. In 1975, Robert L. Munger Jr. took over as president of Cedar Point after Roose retired. The record-breaking Corkscrew roller coaster was built in 1976; it was the first roller coaster to span a midway and have three inversions. Gemini opened in 1978 and was advertised as the tallest, fastest and steepest roller coaster in the world. A kiddie coaster, named Jr. Gemini (now known as Wilderness Run), opened the following year across from the Gemini. White Water Landing opened in 1982, replacing the original Shoot the Rapids log flume. In 1983, Demon Drop was built at the front of the park. Avalanche Run opened in 1985 close to the beach and would later be re-themed as Disaster Transport. That same year, the San Francisco Earthquake Ride was transformed into the Berenstain Bear Country.

While Cedar Point operated independently up until this point, Munger saw the opportunity to expand by acquiring Valleyfair amusement park in Minnesota in 1978. Parent company Cedar Fair Limited Partnership, commonly known as Cedar Fair, was later formed in 1983. Its name was derived from both parks – &quot;Cedar&quot; representing Cedar Point and &quot;Fair&quot; representing Valleyfair. The company went public on April 29, 1987.
===Dick Kinzel era===

Robert L. Munger Jr, who also served as president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Cedar Fair, stepped down in 1986 due to health issues and was replaced by Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Kinzel. Thunder Canyon, a river rafting ride manufactured by Intamin, also opened in 1986. In 1987, Iron Dragon, a suspended roller coaster, debuted on the Million Dollar Midway near the Cedar Point &amp; Lake Erie Railroad station. In 1988, Soak City (now known as Cedar Point Shores), Cedar Point&#x27;s outdoor water park, was constructed near Hotel Breakers. It featured speed slides, more than 10 body and tube slides, a family raft ride, a water playhouse, and two lazy rivers.

Cedar Point added several record-breaking rides from 1989 to 2011 under Kinzel&#x27;s management. Magnum XL-200 debuted in 1989 as the tallest and fastest roller coaster in the world. It was the first coaster to exceed the barrier, which led to the coining of the industry term hypercoaster. It was also the first to reach speeds greater than . Magnum is often credited as shifting the focus of Cedar Point, as noted by then-park Vice President, John Hildebrandt: &quot;We all were smart enough to know we had something. Big steel made a big difference and with Magnum we started branding ourselves as a big time roller coaster park&quot;. To keep the momentum going, Mean Streak opened in 1991 as the northernmost attraction in the park. It broke records for the tallest and fastest wooden roller coaster in the world, reaching a maximum speed of and a height of .

Between major releases, the park continued to service and transform other rides, as well as build additional rides, areas, and amenities. For the 1990 season, Avalanche Run was transformed into Disaster Transport, adding special effects and fully enclosing the ride. Challenge Park was built between Hotel Breakers and Soak City in 1992. Challenge Park included RipCord, Skyscraper, and two eighteen-hole mini-golf courses. Snake River Falls was constructed in 1993 as a result of Soak City&#x27;s popularity. The structure sent riders plunging down a 50-degree angle at . At the bottom of the hill, the ride ended with a splash landing that created a large wave, which splashed spectators on an overlooking bridge. It opened as the tallest and fastest water ride in the world.

In 1994, Cedar Point unveiled Raptor, which opened as the tallest, fastest, and longest inverted roller coaster in the world, and the first ever to feature the signature cobra roll element. To accommodate the footprint of the new coaster, the Mill Race log flume was removed, and the circular Calypso was relocated. In December 1994, the park held its only Christmas in the Park. The Midway Carousel was open, a horse-drawn carriage gave behind-the-scenes tours of the park and the midway held many Christmas festivals, including a Christmas tree.

In 1996, Cedar Point opened Mantis, then the tallest, steepest, and fastest stand-up roller coaster in the world. Originally, the ride was to be called &quot;Banshee&quot;, but it was later changed after negative public reaction. The discarded name would later be reused for Banshee at Kings Island in 2014. In 1997, the park introduced HalloWeekends, a Halloween-themed event with haunted houses and mazes, which typically operates from September through late October. Camp Snoopy debuted in 1999 featuring eight Snoopy-themed attractions, with the exception of a Tilt-A-Whirl. The area also features a junior roller coaster built by Vekoma, Woodstock Express.

Cedar Point built the first giga coaster, Millennium Force, in 2000. When it debuted, it was the tallest and fastest complete-circuit roller coaster in the world, climbing and reaching a maximum speed of . In 2002, Wicked Twister opened as the tallest, fastest, and longest inverted impulse roller coaster of its kind. In the midst of a highly-competitive industry with other parks, Cedar Point again set new records the following year with the debut of Top Thrill Dragster, which opened as the tallest and fastest roller coaster in the world in 2003. It reached a height of and a maximum speed of . Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure broke both records two years later.
maXair debuted in 2005 as only the second HUSS Giant Frisbee ride in the United States. Dan Keller also retired in 2005 as vice president and general manager. He was replaced by John Hildebrandt, who had been vice president and general manager of Dorney Park &amp; Wildwater Kingdom since May 2004.

In 2006, Skyhawk was built next to Snake River Falls; it is currently the tallest Screamin&#x27; Swing in the world. In the 2007 season, Cedar Point built Maverick, which features a drop at a 95-degree angle and includes a linear synchronous motor (LSM) launch in the middle of the ride reaching speeds of . In 2008, Cedar Point introduced Planet Snoopy, a kids&#x27; area constructed on the site of Peanuts Playground; it consists of family and children&#x27;s rides relocated from Cedar Point&#x27;s sister park Geauga Lake after it closed. The area also consisted of a &quot;Kids Only&quot; restaurant called Joe Cool Cafe, which had a small menu for adults.

In 2009, &quot;Starlight Experience&quot; debuted, a night-time LED light extravaganza with floats themed to the four seasons. The $1,000,000 attraction took place on the Frontier Trail nightly beginning at twilight. In 2010, Cedar Point added a new flume ride on the park&#x27;s Frontier Trail named Shoot the Rapids, which included two drops and a three-minute journey through a rustic, western-themed environment. It was removed in February 2016 following a history of low ridership and a serious incident in 2013 injuring seven riders. WindSeeker, a tall tower that spins riders along the shoreline of Lake Erie, was introduced in 2011. WindSeeker did not open on time due to construction delays and opened to the public on June 14, 2011.

===Modern era===
On June 20, 2011, Cedar Fair announced that Dick Kinzel would retire on January 3, 2012, and Matt Ouimet would become the CEO of the company. Ouimet was employed by The Walt Disney Company for 17 years, including tenures as president of Disney Cruise Line and the Disneyland Resort.

In 2012, Cedar Point added &quot;Dinosaurs Alive!&quot;, a walk-through exhibit featuring approximately 50 life-size animatronic dinosaurs. It was located on Adventure Island and replaced the Paddlewheel Excursions boat cruise ride. Dinosaurs Alive! was replaced with Forbidden Frontier after the 2018 season. A six-lane mat racer slide complex called was added to Soak City. The slides around were repainted and the Speed Slides were dismantled to make room for . Cedar Point also introduced Fast Lane, their version of a fast-pass system, and a new nighttime show, &quot;Luminosity – Ignite the Night!&quot;. Cedar Point also removed WildCat for the 2012 season to make room for Luminosity. This was the first time since 1978 that a roller coaster was removed from Cedar Point.
On July 13, 2012, Cedar Point announced the removal of Disaster Transport and Space Spiral. Exactly a month later, Cedar Point announced GateKeeper, the longest wing coaster in the world, which opened on May 11, 2013. Along with GateKeeper, a new main entrance plaza was constructed, replacing the entrance that was built in the 1960s. It features two -tall support columns that the GateKeeper trains go through. Cedar Point invested $60 million in its resort hotels over the next three years, starting in the 2013–2014 offseason. At the end of the 2013 season, John Hildebrandt retired as the park&#x27;s general manager and was replaced by Jason McClure, the former vice president and general manager of Dorney Park &amp; Wildwater Kingdom.

Two new family attractions called Pipe Scream and Lake Erie Eagles were added in 2014, along with a pay-per-ride thrill ride named SlingShot. Camp Snoopy and the Gemini Midway underwent renovations the same year, and some rides within those areas were relocated and given new themes. In 2015, the stand-up coaster Mantis was transformed into a floorless roller coaster called Rougarou, receiving new trains and a new green and orange paint scheme in the process. Also in 2015, Hotel Breakers received a $25-million renovation. A new roller coaster called Valravn debuted in 2016 as the tallest, fastest, and longest dive coaster in the world. The ride replaced the 40-year-old Good Time Theater along with an antique car ride known as Turnpike Cars. Calypso was also moved in the process to the beach area near GateKeeper, where it was renamed Tiki Twirl. Raptor and Top Thrill Dragster were repainted as well.
As the 2016 season came to a close, Cedar Point announced that Mean Streak would close permanently on September 16, 2016, although park officials declined to confirm that it was being torn down. The park teased subtle hints over the following year that the roller coaster was, in fact, being refurbished. In August 2017, Cedar Point officially confirmed that Mean Streak would reemerge as Steel Vengeance in 2018.

The park was set to celebrate its &quot;150th Anniversary Season&quot; in 2020, introducing a new family boat ride attraction called Snake River Expedition. However, both the celebration and the new ride&#x27;s debut were postponed until 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In April 2021, Carrie Boldman became vice president and the first female general manager in Cedar Point history, after Jason McClure was promoted to a corporate position at Cedar Fair. HalloWeekends returned in 2021 with an expanded operating calendar, which included Halloween Haunt and Tricks and Treats Fall Fest. Wicked Twister closed permanently on September 6, 2021, to make room for future development. An incident at Top Thrill Dragster in August 2021, which resulted in a serious injury to a guest waiting in line, prompted an investigation by the Ohio Department of Agriculture. The park closed the ride the following two seasons and announced in 2023 that it would be modified by Zamperla to feature a second tower and two additional launches. In 2024, it briefly reopened as Top Thrill 2, before being closed after a few days of operation for the remainder of the season for extensive repairs.

Cedar Point features several historic buildings on the peninsula. Many of the buildings and structures on the peninsula are from the late 1800s or early 1900s. The oldest structure on the peninsula is the Cedar Point Light. It is a restored lighthouse that was built in 1862 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on July 19, 1984. Located along the main midway is the Coliseum. The Coliseum was built in 1906 with the newly expanded Midway.

Another building that is listed on the NRHP is the U.S. Coast Guard Building located along Perimeter Road that stretches around the peninsula.

All three of Cedar Point&#x27;s carousels are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Midway Carousel, otherwise known as the Daniel C. Muller Carousel, is located at the front of the park. It opened in 1912 and was brought to Cedar Point in 1946. A Sandusky family purchased the ride and operated it at the park. It became the property of Cedar Point in 1963. It is Cedar Point&#x27;s oldest operating ride and was added to the NRHP on October 20, 1982.

==In popular culture==
Cedar Point has had a cultural influence on American society as evidenced in many forms of media such as books, television, and film. In the 1940 biographical film &quot;Knute Rockne, All American&quot; documenting the life of famous Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne, Cedar Point is featured at a pivotal point in the story. In 1913, Knute works as a lifeguard on a beach at Cedar Point, where he and his college roommate Gus Dorais worked on the forward pass. The concept, which was first used in a scrimmage game at Cedar Point, would revolutionize the sport and the film would later be preserved in the Library of Congress National Film Registry. In 2004, an independently produced film, &quot;Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind: Infestation From Mars&quot;, was shot at several historic locations around Sandusky including Cedar Point. Dick Kinzel, CEO of Cedar Fair at the time, had a brief speaking role in the film.

In the 2006 book &quot;The Warrior Heir&quot; by Cinda Williams Chima, the main characters take a field trip to Cedar Point with their high school class. In a 2010 episode of &quot;Bert the Conqueror&quot; on the Travel Channel, Bert takes the &quot;Foursome Fearsome&quot; roller-coaster challenge in which he rides the four fastest and tallest coasters in the park in under an hour. A 2012 episode of Travel Channel&#x27;s &quot;Off Limits&quot; takes a look at off-season maintenance at the park and features the host, Don Wildman, working with the maintenance crew on Mean Streak and Millennium Force. In 2012, the &quot;Extreme Heights&quot; and &quot;Speed Demons&quot; episodes of &quot;Insane Coaster Wars&quot; on the Travel Channel feature Cedar Point coasters Millennium Force and Top Thrill Dragster, respectively.

<text>Atargatis (known as Derceto by the Greeks) was the chief goddess of northern Syria in Classical antiquity. Primarily she was a fertility goddess, but, as the &quot;baalat&quot; (&quot;mistress&quot;) of her city and people she was also responsible for their protection and well-being. Her chief sanctuary was at Hierapolis, modern Manbij, northeast of Aleppo, Syria.

Michael Rostovtzeff called her &quot;the great mistress of the North Syrian lands&quot;. Her consort is usually Hadad. As Ataratheh, doves and fish were considered sacred to her: doves as an emblem of the love goddess, and fish as symbolic of the fertility and life of the waters.

According to a third-century Syriac source, &quot;In Syria and in Urhâi [Edessa] the men used to castrate themselves in honor of Taratha. But when King Abgar became a [Christian] believer, he commanded that anyone who emasculated himself should have a hand cut off. And from that day to the present no one in Urhâi emasculates himself anymore&quot;.

She is sometimes described as a mermaid-goddess, due to identification of her with a fish-bodied goddess at Ashkelon.

==Origin and name==
Atargatis is seen as a continuation of Bronze Age goddesses. At Ugarit, cuneiform tablets attest multiple Canaanite goddesses, among them three are considered as relevant to theories about the origin of Atargatis:
* ʾAṯirat, described as &quot;Lady of the Sea&quot; (&quot;rbt ảṯrt ym&quot;) and &quot;mother of the gods&quot; (&quot;qnyt ỉlm&quot;)
*ʿAnat, a war goddess
*ʿAṯtart, a goddess of the hunt also sharing Anat&#x27;s warlike role, regarded as analogous to Ishtar and Ishara in Ugaritic god lists and as such possibly connected to love

John Day asserts that all three shared many traits with each other and may have been worshipped in conjunction or separately during 1500 years of cultural history. While the worship of Ashtart and Anat as a pair is well attested, Steve A. Wiggins found no evidence Ashtart was ever conflated with Athirat. He also pointed out that the concept of Athirat, Anat and Ashtart as a trinity of sorts (popularized by authors like Tikva Frymer-Kensky), is modern and ignores the role of other deities in Ugarit - for example Shapash; as well as the importance of the connection between Athirat and El.

The original Aramaic name of the goddess was (), with its other forms including (), (), (), and the apocope form (). The name was composed of:
* (, from earlier ), which during the Iron Age had evolved from being the name of the goddess ʿAṯtart to become used to mean &quot;goddess&quot; in general, and was used in the name in the sense of &quot;goddess&quot;;
* and (), which is the Aramaic variant of the name of the Semitic goddess ʿAnat.

The Greek name of the goddess, attested in the forms (), (), (), and (), was derived from the non-apocope forms of its original Aramaic name, while her Greek name () was derived from ().

== Classical period ==
Various Greek and Latin writers have written about the goddess Atargatis or Derketo.

Atargatis generally appears as the wife of Hadad. They are the protecting deities of the community. Atargatis, wearing a mural crown, is the ancestor the royal house, the founder of social and religious life, the goddess of generation and fertility (hence the prevalence of phallic emblems), and the inventor of useful appliances.
Derceto was venerated in mermaid form, i.e., with &quot;a face of a woman, and otherwise the entire body of a fish&quot; in a shrine by Ashkelon, Syria, according to Diodorus (1st century BCE), drawing on Ctesias (5th century BCE); the attached myth explaining that Derceto transformed into a fish, after drowning herself in a nearby lake. The goddess was presumably revered in that fish-form at Ashkelon. It has been conjectured that the veneration of the goddess did indeed occur at Ashkelon and may have originated there. 

The image of Derceto as half-woman half-fish was also witnessed by Lucian (2nd century) somewhere in Phoenicia (i.e., Phoenice Syria), but at the Holy City of Phoenicia (Hierapolis Bambyce), she was depicted entirely as a woman. This temple was nominally dedicated to &quot;Hera&quot;, but some thought it actually consecrated Derceto.
 Lucian in a later passage gives a description at length of this &quot;Hera&quot; whom the locals &quot;call by a different name&quot; (Atargatis), at Hierapolis. The goddess was posed seated with two lions on her sides, &quot;In one hand she had a scepter, in the other a spindle, and on her head she wears rays, a tower [mural crown]..&quot;, and she wore a girdle () as well. The head was set with a gemstone called &quot;&quot; which glowed by night.

The worship of Atargatis going back to the Hellenistic Phoenicia (Seleucid Syria) is evidenced by inscriptions at Akko.

== Iconography ==
The literary attestations as already given are that Derceto was depicted as fish-tailed goddess at Ashkelon (by Ctesias after Diodorus), and later at Hieropolis (by Lucian).

But all of the extant iconography of the Syriac goddess catalogued in the &quot;LIMC&quot; shows her as anthropomorphic. But the &quot;fish-goddess form of Atargatis&quot; were among the finds unearthed in the Transjordan, or so Glueck (cf. &quot;infra&quot;) has insisted, though only her forms as goddess of &quot;foliage and fruits&quot; or cereal goddess were published in his paper.

=== Numismatics ===

The tetradrachm issued under Demetrius III Eucaerus (96–87 BCE, coin image above) shows a fish-bodied figure on the reverse side, which scholarship identifies as Stargateis. The cult statues of Stargateis and her consort Hadad were commonly employed on as the motif on the reverse of tetradrachm coinage by this monarch and by Antiochus XII Dionysus (87– 84 BCE) who succeeded him.

Hieropolis Bambyce was one of the cities which minted its own coins. And some of the Hieropolitan coinage portray &quot;Atargatis as indeed seated between lions and holds a scepter in her right hand and probably a spindle in her left&quot;, just as Lucian had described. Palmyra coinage also depicts a Tyche on the obverse and strolling lion on the reverse; one coin also depicts a goddess mounted on a lion, and the lion symbolism suggest that Atargatis is being represented.

Coinage of Palmyra, some of which were found in the Palmyrene colony at Dura-Europos, may depict the goddess. The coin with Tyche on the obverse and a strolling lion on the reverse, and one with a goddess riding a lion points to Atargatis, based on the lion motif. There has also been found one Palmyrene tessera (token) inscribed with Atargatis&#x27;s name (Aramaic: ).

=== Sculptures ===
A relief fragment found at Dura-Europos is thought to represent Atargatis/Tyche (Yale-French excavations, 1935–46), as it shows a pair of doves that are sacred to Atargatis besides her head; the doves are assumed to be perched on the post of her throne, which is missing. The figure&#x27;s mural crown is emblematic of a Tyche (protector-goddess) of a city, but this matches the historic account that the cult relief Atargatis Hierapolis was seen wearing a mural crown.

In the temples of Atargatis at Palmyra and at Dura-Europos she appeared repeatedly with her consort, Hadad, and in the richly syncretic religious culture at Dura-Europos, was worshipped as &quot;Artemis Azzanathkona&quot;.

In the 1930s, numerous Nabatean bas-relief busts of Atargatis were identified by Nelson Glueck at Khirbet et-Tannûr, Jordan, in temple ruins of the early first century CE; there the lightly veiled goddess&#x27;s lips and eyes had once been painted red, and a pair of fish confronted one another above her head. Her wavy hair, suggesting water to Glueck, was parted in the middle. At Petra the goddess from the north was syncretised with a North Arabian goddess from the south al-Uzzah, worshipped in the one temple. At Dura-Europus among the attributes of Atargatis are the spindle and the sceptre or fish-spear.

== Mythology ==
The legends are numerous and of an astrological character. A rationale for the Syrian dove-worship and abstinence from fish is seen in the story in Athenaeus 8.37, where &quot;Atargatis&quot; is naively explained to mean &quot;without Gatis&quot;, the name of a queen who is said to have forbidden the eating of fish.

Diodorus Siculus (2.4.2), quoting Ctesius of Cnidus, tells how Derceto fell in love with a beautiful youth named Simios (also Ichthys, meaning &#x27;fish&#x27;) and bore a daughter but becoming ashamed of the illicit love, Derceto flung herself into a lake near Ashkelon and her body was changed into the form of a fish though her head remained human. In Diodorus&#x27;s version of the legend, Derceto also despised the child from this union and had exposed the daughter to the desert, where she was raised by doves. This child grew up to be Semiramis, the legendary Assyrian queen. Lucian also notes that the erection of the temple at Hieropolis was ascribed by some to Semiramis who dedicated it to her mother Derceto.

=== Analysis ===
Ctesias&#x27;s account, according to one analysis, is composed of two myths, the Derceto transformation myth, and the Semiramis birth myth, and a telling of each myth are told by a number of classical writers.

The first myth (the Derceto metamorphosis into fish) is told, e.g., by Ovid as a Dione-Cupid myth. The irony is that even though Ovid explicitly mentions Derceto () of Babylonia transforming into a fish, Ovid&#x27;s version of this first myth (detailed below) is recorded in &quot;Fasti&quot;, and fails to mention the goddess in Syria (Dione) metamorphosing into fish-shape. The metamorphosis thereafter needs be reconstructed by consulting other sources which preserves that original ending.

The second myth (the Semiramis birth myth) is told by various writers as an alternate version of the birth of Venus (from an egg carried ashore by fish, then hatched by doves), however, Ctesias felt compelled to &quot;drop&quot; the egg element according to the analysis. This seemed a gratuitous (&quot;incredible&quot;) excision to the analyst, given that Venus&#x27;s birth from an ocean-found egg was not a far cry from the familiar version of the Aphrodite/Venus&#x27;s genesis out of water (sea-foam).

=== Syrian Venus ===
Ovid in &quot;Fasti&quot; recounts the legend that the goddess Dione accompanied by Cupid/Eros plunged into the river in Palestine (Euphrates), whereby a pair of fish came to convey them through water to aid her escape from Typhon. The fish pair was commemorated as the constellation Pisces of the zodiac, and local Syrians abstain from eating fish on account of it. Menander and others also relate this legend, and some of the versions, say that the goddess and Cupid subsequently transformed into fish, possibly preserving the original telling.

The name Dione could refer to Aphrodite&#x27;s mother, but it was also an epithet of Aphrodite/Venus herself. So the legend has also been told as one of Venus with Cupid casting herself into the Euphrates, then transforming into fish.

The second myth describes the birth of Syrian Venus as originating in an egg that fell into the Euphrates, rolled onto land by fish, was hatched in the clutches of doves (&quot;scholia&quot; to Germanicus&#x27;s Aratus; Hyginus, &quot;Fabulae&quot;). 

The author of &quot;Catasterismi&quot; explained the constellation of Piscis Austrinus as the parent of the two fish making up the constellation of Pisces; according to that account, it was placed in the heavens in memory of Derceto&#x27;s fall into the lake at Hierapolis Bambyce near the Euphrates in Syria, from which she was saved by a large fish — which again is intended to explain the Syrian abstinence from fish.

=== Syncretism ===

In many cases Atargatis, &#x27;Ashtart, and other goddesses who once had independent cults and mythologies became fused to such an extent as to be indistinguishable. This fusion is exemplified by the temple at Carnion (Carnaim), which is probably identical with the famous temple of &#x27;Ashtart at Ashtaroth-Karnaim.

Not unnaturally she is identified with the Greek Aphrodite. By the conjunction of her many functions (as fertility goddess and of appliances), she becomes ultimately a great nature-goddess analogous to Cybele and Rhea, despite originating as a sea deity analogous to Amphitrite. In one aspect she typifies the protection of water in producing life; in another, the universal of other-earth; in a third (influenced, no doubt, by Chaldean astrology), the power of Destiny. She was also identified with Hera by Lucian in his &quot;De Dea Syria&quot;.

As a consequence of the first half of the name, Atargatis has frequently, though wrongly, been identified as Ashtart. The two deities were probably of common origin and have many features in common, but their cults are historically distinct. There is reference in 2 Maccabees 12.26 and 1 Maccabees 5:43 to an Atargateion or Atergateion, a temple of Atargatis, at Carnion in Gilead, but the home of the goddess was unquestionably not Israel or Canaan, but Syria itself; at Hierapolis Bambyce she had a temple in her name.

A recent analysis of the cult of Atargatis is an essay by Per Bilde, in which Atargatis appears in the context of other Hellenized Great Goddesses of the East.

== Cult ==
=== Temples ===

At her temples at Ashkelon, Hierapolis Bambyce, and Edessa, there were fish ponds containing fish only her priests might touch. Glueck noted in his 1937 paper that &quot;to this day there is a sacred fish-pond swarming with untouchable fish at Qubbet el-Baeddwī, a dervish monastery three kilometres east of Tripolis, Lebanon.&quot;

The relief sculpture of the Syrian Goddess at Hierapolis was supported by a pair of tritonesses according 
Lucian.

Cult sites in the Near East include Dura-Europos, Palmyra, Akko (Ptolemais), Carnaim and Nabataea. Two well preserved temples in Niha, Lebanon are dedicated to her and to her consort Hadad.

From Syria, the worship of Atargatis and Hadad extended to Greece and to the furthest West into the Mediterranean. Lucian and Apuleius gave descriptions of the beggar-priests who went round the great cities with an image of the goddess on an ass and collected money. The wide extension of the cult is attributable largely to Syrian merchants; thus we find traces of it in the great seaport towns; at Delos especially numerous inscriptions have been found bearing witness to her importance. Again we find the cult in Sicily, introduced, no doubt, by slaves and mercenary troops, who carried it even to the farthest northern limits of the Roman Empire. The leader of the rebel slaves in the First Servile War, a Syrian named Eunus, claimed to receive visions of Atargatis, whom he identified with the Demeter of Enna.

=== Priesthood ===
During the Roman era, eunuch priests worshipped Atargatis, similar to the Galli priests of Cybele. At the shrine in Hieropolis founded by Semiramis, eunuch priests served the image of a fish-tailed woman. Rituals to the goddess were accompanied by flute playing and rattle shaking. In one rite, young males castrated themselves to become cross-dressing priests at the temple and thereafter performed tasks usually done by women. The obligatory lake or pond lay nearby, full of sacred fish which no one was allowed to eat; nor could anyone eat Atargatis&#x27;s sacred doves. The priests were described by Apuleius as mendicants that traveled around with an image of the goddess dressed in a silken robe on the back of a donkey. When they arrived at village squares or a receptive estate they would perform an ecstatic rite, designed to attract a crowd and elicit their contributions. The priests were described as effeminate, wearing heavy makeup, turbans on their heads, and dressed in saffron colored robes of silk and linen; some in white tunics painted with purple stripes. They shouted and danced wildly to the music of flutes, whirling around with necks bent so that their long hair flew out; and in an ecstatic frenzy they would bite their own flesh and cut their arms with knives until they bled.

According to a story retold by Lucian, the Assyrian queen Stratonice saw in a vision that she must build a temple at Hieropolis to the goddess and so the king sent her there with a young man named Combabus to execute the task. Knowing the queen&#x27;s reputation Combabus castrated himself and left his genitals, sealed in a box. When the queen fell in love with Combabus and tried to seduce him, he revealed his mutilation, but this didn&#x27;t dissuade her from desiring his constant companionship. When Stratonice and Combabus returned home, she accused him of trying to seduce her, and Combabus was arrested, tried, and sentenced to death. Combabus called for the sealed box to prove his innocence, where upon the king relented and rewarded Combabus for his loyalty. The temple was completed and a statue of Combabus was placed in it. This is said to be the origin of the practice of castration by the priests in the temple.

Another story ascribed to Combabus mentions that a certain foreign woman who had joined a sacred assembly, beholding a human form of extreme beauty and dressed in man&#x27;s attire, became violently enamoured of him: after discovering that he was a eunuch, she committed suicide. Combabus accordingly in despair at his incapacity for love, donned woman&#x27;s attire, so that no woman in future might be deceived in the same way.

<text>The pilum (; : &quot;pila&quot;) was a javelin commonly used by the Roman army in ancient times. It was generally about long overall, consisting of an iron shank about in diameter and long with a pyramidal head, attached to a wooden shaft by either a socket or a flat tang.

== History ==
The &quot;pilum &quot;may have originated from an Italic tribe known as the Samnites. It also may 
have been influenced by Celtiberian and Etruscan weapons. The &quot;pilum&quot; may have derived from a Celtiberian weapon known as the&quot; falarica&quot;. Archaeological excavations have disclosed &quot;pila&quot; in tombs at the Etruscan city of Tarquinia. The oldest finds of pila are from the Etruscan settlements of Vulci and Talamone. The first identified written reference to the &quot;pilum&quot; comes from &quot;The Histories&quot; of Polybius. According to Polybius, more heavily armed Roman military soldiers used a spear called the &quot;hyssoí&quot;. This may have been the &quot;pilum&quot;. The precursor to the &quot;pilum&quot; was the &quot;hasta&quot;. It is unclear how soon it was replaced by the &quot;pilum&quot;. Polybius mentioned that it was an important contributor to the Roman victory at the Battle of Telamon in 225 BCE. Use of the &quot;pilum&quot; was discontinued by Roman military in the second century.

==Design==
A &quot;pilum&quot; had a total weight between , with the versions produced during the earlier Republic being slightly heavier than those produced in the later Empire.

The weapon had a hard pyramidal tip, but the shank was sometimes made of softer iron. The softness could cause the shank to bend after impact, thus rendering the weapon useless to the enemy. According to Davide Antonio Secci, the &quot;pilum&quot; was not meant to bend on impact, but instead was meant to break. If a &quot;pilum&quot; struck a shield, it might embed itself, and the bending of the shank would force the enemy to discard his shield as unusable without removing the &quot;pilum&quot;, or carry around the shield burdened by the weight of the &quot;pilum&quot;. Even if the shank did not bend, the pyramidal tip still made it difficult to pull out. Many cases occurred, though, in which the whole shank was hardened, making the &quot;pilum&quot; more suitable as a close-quarters melee weapon and also making it usable by enemy soldiers.

Although the bending of its shank is commonly seen as an integral part of the weapon&#x27;s design and as an intentional feature, little evidence suggests that. The most commonly found artifacts suggest that the &quot;pilum&quot; was constructed to use the weight of the weapon to cause damage, most likely to be able to impale through armour and reach the enemy soldier&#x27;s body. The combination of the weapon&#x27;s weight and the aforementioned pyramidal tip (the design of which was seen in the Middle Ages in the form of bodkin arrow tips), made the &quot;pilum&quot; a formidable armour-piercing weapon. If the weapon was meant to be used against armour and to use its mass (as opposed to its speed) to cause damage, the bending of the shank seems to be a beneficial result of its intended use, which is to pierce through layers of armour. That the &quot;pilum&quot; needed to pierce layers of armour (through the shield, into body armour and past clothing) necessitated a lengthy shank, which was prone to bending. M.C. Bishop wrote that the momentum of the &quot;pilum&quot; caused the shank to bend upon impact, and although unintended, that proved a useful characteristic of the weapon. However, a newer work by M. C. Bishop states that &quot;pila&quot; are &quot;unlikely to bend under their own weight when thrown and striking a target or ground&quot;; rather, human intervention such as improper removal of a &quot;pilum&quot; stuck in a target is responsible in some way, and Caesar&#x27;s writings should be interpreted as the &quot;pilum&quot; bending when soldiers tried to remove them.

Since the pyramidal tip of a &quot;pilum&quot; was wider than the rest of the shank, once it had penetrated a shield, it left behind a hole larger than the rest of the shank, and it could move through the shield with little resistance, stabbing the soldier behind. The length of the shank and its depth of penetration also made pulling it out of a shield more difficult, even if it failed to bend. If the bearer of the shield was charging and a &quot;pilum&quot; penetrated the shield, the end of the heavy shaft of the &quot;pilum&quot; would hit the ground, holding the shield in place. Some &quot;pila&quot; had a spike on the end of the shaft, which made it easier to dig into the ground.

The two versions of &quot;pila&quot; are heavy and light. Pictorial evidence suggests that some versions of the weapon were weighted by a lead ball to increase penetrative power, but archaeological specimens of that design variant are not (so far) known. Recent experiments have shown &quot;pila&quot; to have a range around , although the effective range is up to . The earliest known examples of heavy &quot;pila&quot; have barbed heads and their tangs have a figure-eight shape.

Romans also used the &quot;pilum&quot; as a melee weapon in close-quarters combat. Note pictorial depictions from the Tropaeum Traiani monument, descriptions of Caesar&#x27;s troops using javelins as pikes against the Gauls in Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Gallic War&quot;, Book VII, and descriptions of Caesar&#x27;s men using javelins to stab at Pompey&#x27;s cavalry in Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Caesar&quot;.

The &quot;angon&quot; was a similar weapon used in late Roman and post-Roman times.

The origin of the design of the &quot;pilum&quot; is a matter of contention. Arguments have been proposed which suggest that the design stemmed from ancient Italian tribes or from the Iberian Peninsula. Considering that two versions of the &quot;pilum&quot; are known (the heavy and the light), the Roman &quot;pilum&quot; may be descended from two different weapons, perhaps from different cultural groups. The two weapons designs may have coalesced into the form of the typical Roman &quot;pilum&quot; as it is known today.

==Tactics==
Legionaries of the late Republic and early Empire often carried two &quot;pila&quot;, with one sometimes being lighter than the other. Standard tactics called for Roman soldiers to throw one of them (both if time permitted) at the enemy, just before charging to engage with the &quot;gladius&quot;; however, Alexander Zhmodikov has argued that the Roman infantry could use &quot;pila&quot; at any stage in the fighting. Zhmodikov has also argued that Roman battle tactics sometimes consisted of exchanging projectile weapons such as the pilum. Sam Koon argues against the idea that Roman tactics primarily consisted of projectile combat.

The effect of the &quot;pilum&quot; throw was to disrupt the enemy formation by attrition and by causing gaps to appear in any protective shield wall. The design of the &quot;pilum&quot;″s tip is such that once wedged inside a shield, it is difficult to remove; a shield thus penetrated by a &quot;pilum&quot; became very awkward to wield, and was usually discarded. This resulted in the aforementioned gaps in the protective shield wall, which could then favour the short &quot;gladius&quot; in tight hand-to-hand mêlées.

&quot;Pila&quot; could also be used in hand-to-hand combat; one documented instance of this occurred at the Siege of Alesia, and another during Mark Antony&#x27;s Parthian campaign. Additionally, &quot;pila&quot; could be employed as a thrusting implement and a barrier against cavalry charges. Some &quot;pila&quot; had small hand-guards, to protect the wielder if he intended to use it as a mêlée weapon, but apparently this was common.

==Vegetius&#x27; commentary==

The Roman writer Vegetius, in his work &quot;De re militari&quot;, wrote:

And later in the same work:

Arguably, a short iron shaft has very few confirmations from archaeology. Vegetius wrote about a one-foot iron shaft because at his time, the &quot;pilum&quot; had disappeared and been replaced by similar shorter weapons such as the &quot;plumbata&quot; and &quot;spiculum&quot;.

==Results of experimental archaeology==
Due in part to experimental archaeology, the design of the &quot;pilum&quot; is believed to have evolved to be armour-piercing; the pyramidal head would punch a small hole through an enemy shield, allowing the thin shank to pass through and penetrate far enough to wound the man behind it. The thick wooden shaft provided the weight behind the punch.

In one description, one of the two iron nails that held the iron shaft in place was replaced with a weak wooden pin that would break on impact, causing the shaft to twist sideways. Gaius Marius is sometimes given credit for that modification. Archaeological evidence from the 80s BC through to the early imperial era show that this redesign was not adopted.

== History ==
=== Medieval period: Rise of the merchant class ===
Merchants emerged as a social class in medieval Italy. Between 1300 and 1500, modern accounting, the bill of exchange, and limited liability were invented, and thus, the world saw &quot;the first true bankers&quot;, who were certainly businesspeople.

Around the same time, Europe saw the &quot;emergence of rich merchants.&quot; This &quot;rise of the merchant class&quot; came as Europe &quot;needed a middleman&quot; for the first time, and these &quot;burghers&quot; or &quot;bourgeois&quot; were the people who played this role.

=== Renaissance to Enlightenment: Rise of the capitalist ===
Europe became the dominant global commercial power in the 16th century, and as Europeans developed new tools for business, new types of &quot;business people&quot; began to use those tools. In this period, Europe developed and used paper money, cheques, and joint-stock companies (and their shares of capital stock). Developments in actuarial science and underwriting led to insurance. Together, these new tools were used by a new kind of businessperson, the capitalist. These people owned or financed businesses as investors, but they were not merchants of goods. These capitalists were a major force in the Industrial Revolution.

The Oxford English Dictionary reports the earliest known use of the word &quot;business-men&quot; in 1798, and of &quot;business-man&quot; in 1803. By 1860, the spelling &quot;businessmen&quot; had emerged.

Merriam Webster reports the earliest known use of the word &quot;businesswoman&quot; in 1827.

=== Modern period: Rise of the business magnate ===
The newest kind of corporate executive working under a business magnate is the manager. One of the first true founders of the management profession was Robert Owen (1771–1858). He was also a business magnate in Scotland. He studied the &quot;problems of productivity and motivation&quot;, and was followed by Frederick Winslow Taylor (1856–1915), who was the first person who studied work with the motive to train his staff in the field of management to make them efficient managers capable of managing his business. After World War I, management became popular due to the example of Herbert Hoover and the Harvard Business School, which offered degrees in business administration (management) with the motive to develop efficient managers so that business magnates could hire them with the goal to increase productivity of the private establishments business magnates own.

== Salary ==

Salaries for businesspeople vary. The salaries of businesspeople can be as high as billions of dollars per year. For example, the owner of Microsoft, Bill Gates makes $4 billion per year. The high salaries which businesspeople earn have often been a source of criticism from many who believe they are paid excessively.

== Entrepreneurship ==

An entrepreneur is a person who sets up a business or multiple businesses (serial entrepreneur). Entrepreneurship may be defined as the creation or extraction of economic value. It is generally thought to embrace risks beyond what is normally encountered in starting a business. Its motivation can include other values than simply economic ones.
In general usage, because the distinction is not clear-cut, the term &#x27;entrepreneur&#x27; may be used as a (self-)promoting euphemism for &#x27;businessperson&#x27;, or it may serve to objectively indicate particular passion and risk-taking in a business field. Still, the distinction is only one by degrees.

<doc id="147294" wikidata="Q2095762" url="?curid=147294" title="Smoot">
<text>The smoot is a nonstandard, humorous unit of length created as part of an MIT fraternity pledge to Lambda Chi Alpha by Oliver R. Smoot, who in October 1958 lay down repeatedly on the Harvard Bridge between Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts, so that his fraternity brothers could use his height to measure the length of the bridge.

==Description==
One smoot is equal to Oliver Smoot&#x27;s height at the time of the pledge, . The bridge&#x27;s length was measured to be &quot;± 1 εar&quot; with the &quot;±&quot; showing measurement uncertainty and spelled with an epsilon to further indicate possible error in the measurement. Over the years the &quot;±&quot; portion and &quot;ε&quot; spelling have been left out in many citations, including some markings at the site itself, but the &quot;±&quot; is recorded on a 50th-anniversary plaque at the end of the bridge.

==History==
Oliver R. Smoot was selected by his Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity pledgemaster because he was deemed shortest—which made measuring the bridge the most labor-intensive—and he was the &quot;most scientifically named.&quot; Smoot repeatedly lay down on the bridge, let his companions mark his new position in chalk or paint, and then got up again. Eventually, he got tired from so much exercise and was carried thereafter by the fraternity brothers to each new position.

Smoot graduated from MIT in 1962, and then attended Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C., where he obtained his Juris Doctor. He served as chairman of the American National Standards Institute from 2001 to 2002, and then as president of the International Organization for Standardization from 2003 to 2004. Neither organization has provided a standard value for the smoot.

Public knowledge and interest in the story began when &quot;Holiday&quot; investigated the marks on the bridge years later, and published an interview with Smoot. The prank&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary was commemorated on October 4, 2008 as Smoot Celebration Day at MIT, which Smoot attended.

A 2016 April Fools&#x27; Day article by the MIT Alumni Association announced that MIT would recalibrate the smoot to and the ear to , and the bridge would thus be 372 smoots, give or take 11 ears.
On May 7, 2016, Smoot served as grand marshal of the alumni parade across the bridge, celebrating the 100th anniversary of MIT&#x27;s move from Boston to Cambridge.

==Practical use==
The bridge is marked with painted markings indicating how many smoots there are from where the sidewalk begins on the Charles River bank in Boston, with a number every ten smoots. The marks were repainted each semester by the incoming associate member class (similar to pledge class) of Lambda Chi Alpha before they were suspended due to repeated infractions of MIT&#x27;s alcohol rules. Lambda Chi Alpha alumni, along with current students of MIT, have maintained the markings.

Markings typically appear every , but additional marks appear at other numbers in between. For example, the mark is accompanied by a mark for 69. The mark is accompanied by the words &quot;Halfway to Hell&quot; and an arrow pointing towards MIT. 

The markings are recognized as milestones on the bridge, to the degree that during bridge renovations in the 1980s, the Cambridge, Massachusetts, police department requested that the markings be restored, since they were routinely used in police reports to identify locations on the bridge. The renovators at the Massachusetts Highway Department also scored the concrete surface of the sidewalk on the bridge at intervals instead of the conventional . The Lambda Zeta (MIT) chapter of Lambda Chi Alpha, which created the smoot markings, continues to repaint the markings once or twice per year.

Starting in 2011, Google Earth enabled the ability to measure distance using smoots, with the standard length of 5 feet 7 inches. The calculator function of Google Search also provides values in smoots, and in 2011, smoot was one of the 10,000 new words added to the fifth edition of &quot;The American Heritage Dictionary&quot;. Robert Tavenor&#x27;s book covering the history of measurement is titled &quot;Smoot&#x27;s Ear: The Measure of Humanity&quot;. MIT&#x27;s student-run college radio station WMBR gives its broadcasting wavelength as , i.e. 88.1 MHz.

<doc id="147301" wikidata="Q170581" url="?curid=147301" title="Nancy Pelosi">
<text>Nancy Patricia Pelosi ( ; ; born March 26, 1940) is an American politician who was the 52nd speaker of the United States House of Representatives, serving from 2007 to 2011 and again from 2019 to 2023. A member of the Democratic Party, she was the first woman elected as U.S. House Speaker and the first woman to lead a major political party in either chamber of Congress, leading the House Democrats from 2003 to 2023. A member of the House since 1987, Pelosi currently represents , which includes most of San Francisco. She is the dean of California&#x27;s congressional delegation.

Pelosi was born and raised in Baltimore, and is the daughter of mayor and congressman Thomas D&#x27;Alesandro Jr. She graduated from Trinity College, Washington, in 1962 and married businessman Paul Pelosi the next year; the two had met while both were students. They moved to New York City before settling down in San Francisco with their children. Focused on raising her family, Pelosi stepped into politics as a volunteer for the Democratic Party in the 1960s. After years of party work, rising to chair the state party, she was first elected to Congress in a 1987 special election and is now in her 20th term. Pelosi steadily rose through the ranks of the House Democratic Caucus to be elected House minority whip in 2001 and elevated to House minority leader a year later, becoming the first woman to hold each of those positions in either chamber of Congress.

In the 2006 midterm elections, Pelosi led the Democrats to a majority in the House for the first time in 12 years and was subsequently elected Speaker, becoming the first woman to hold the office. Until Kamala Harris became vice president in 2021, Pelosi was the highest-ranking woman in the presidential line of succession in U.S. history, as the speaker of the House is second in the line of succession. During her first speakership, Pelosi was a major opponent of the Iraq War as well as the Bush administration&#x27;s attempts to partially privatize Social Security. She participated in the passage of the Obama administration&#x27;s landmark bills, including the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and the 2010 Tax Relief Act. Pelosi lost the speakership after the Republican Party retook the majority in the 2010 midterm elections, but she retained her role as leader of the House Democrats and became House minority leader for a second time.

In the 2018 midterm elections, Democrats regained majority control of the House, and Pelosi was again elected Speaker, becoming the first former speaker to reclaim the gavel since Sam Rayburn in 1955. During her second speakership, the House twice impeached President Donald Trump, first in December 2019 and again in January 2021; the Senate acquitted Trump both times. She participated in the passage of the Biden administration&#x27;s landmark bills, including the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, and the Respect for Marriage Act. In the 2022 midterm elections, Republicans narrowly regained control of the House for the new Congress, ending her tenure as speaker. She subsequently retired as House Democratic leader. On November 29, 2022, the Steering and Policy Committee of the House Democratic Caucus named Pelosi &quot;Speaker Emerita&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Nancy Pelosi was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to an Italian-American family. She was the only daughter and the youngest of six children of Annunciata M. &quot;Nancy&quot; D&#x27;Alesandro (née Lombardi) and Thomas D&#x27;Alesandro Jr. Her mother was born in Fornelli, Isernia, Molise, in Southern Italy, and emigrated to the U.S. in 1912; her father traced his Italian ancestry to Genoa, Venice and Abruzzo. When Pelosi was born, her father was a Democratic congressman from Maryland. He became Baltimore mayor seven years later. Pelosi&#x27;s mother was also active in politics, organizing Democratic women and teaching her daughter political skills. Pelosi&#x27;s brother, Thomas D&#x27;Alesandro III, also a Democrat, was elected Baltimore City Council president and later served as mayor from 1967 to 1971.

Pelosi helped her father at his campaign events, and she attended President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s inaugural address in January 1961.

In 1958, Pelosi graduated from the Institute of Notre Dame, an all-girls Catholic high school in Baltimore. In 1962, she graduated from Trinity College (now Trinity Washington University) in Washington, D.C., with a Bachelor of Arts in political science. Pelosi interned for Senator Daniel Brewster (D-Maryland) in the 1960s alongside future House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.

== Early career ==
After moving to San Francisco, Pelosi became friends with 5th district congressman Phillip Burton and began working her way up in Democratic politics. In 1976, she was elected as a Democratic National Committee member from California, a position she would hold until 1996. She was elected as party chair for Northern California in 1977, and four years later was selected to head the California Democratic Party, which she led until 1983. Subsequently, Pelosi served as the San Francisco Democratic National Convention Host Committee chairwoman in 1984, and then as Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee finance chair from 1985 to 1986.

== Early political career ==
Phillip Burton died in 1983 and his wife, Sala Burton, won a special election to fill the remainder of her husband&#x27;s congressional term. She was then reelected to two more terms in her own right. Burton became ill with cancer in late 1986 and decided not to run for reelection in 1988. She wanted Pelosi to succeed her, guaranteeing Pelosi the support of the Burtons&#x27; contacts. Burton died on February 1, 1987, one month after being sworn in for a second full term. Pelosi won the special election to succeed her, defeating Democratic San Francisco supervisor Harry Britt on April 7, 1987, and Republican Harriet Ross in a June 2 runoff. Pelosi took office a week later. In the primary, Britt, a gay man, had courted San Francisco&#x27;s sizable homosexual population by arguing that he would be better than Pelosi at addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Pelosi had held many campaign events, amassed a large number of campaign volunteers, and fundraised prolifically for her campaign.

Pelosi has continued to represent approximately the same area of San Francisco for her entire congressional career, despite the boundaries shifting marginally in decennial post-reapportionment redistrictings. This area has been represented in the House by Democrats uninterruptedly since 1949, and is strongly Democratic-leaning (as of 2006, 13% of registered voters in the boundaries of Pelosi&#x27;s district were Republican). It has not seen a serious Republican congressional contender since the early 1960s. Pelosi has been reelected to the House 18 times without any substantive opposition. Unlike in her 1987 campaign, Pelosi has not participated in candidates&#x27; debates in her reelection campaigns. In her first seven reelection campaigns (from 1988 through 2004), she won an average of 80% of the vote.

At the time that Pelosi entered office, there were only 23 women in the House.

When Pelosi entered office, the AIDS epidemic was at a dire point. San Francisco was greatly affected; its large population of gay men was the epidemic&#x27;s initial epicenter. Beginning in her first term, Pelosi became a prominent congressional advocate on behalf of those impacted by HIV/AIDS. Shortly after she took office, she hired a gay man as her congressional office&#x27;s director of AIDS policy. In her first floor speech, Pelosi promised that she would be an advocate in the fight against what she called &quot;the crisis of AIDS.&quot; With great stigma around the subject, some in her party privately chastised her for publicly associating herself with it. Pelosi co-authored the Ryan White CARE Act, which allocated funding dedicated to providing treatment and services for those impacted by HIV/AIDS. President George H. W. Bush signed the bill into law in December 1990.

In March 1988, Pelosi voted for the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (as well as to override President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s veto).

Pelosi helped shape the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, working with California Senator Dianne Feinstein and New York Congressman Chuck Schumer. It became law in 1994. Pelosi also held chairs on important committees, such as the House Appropriations Committee and the House Intelligence Committee.

In 2001, Pelosi was elected the House minority whip, second-in-command to Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. She was the first woman in U.S. history to hold that post. Pelosi defeated John Lewis and Steny Hoyer for the position. A strong fundraiser, she used campaign contributions to help persuade other members of Congress to support her candidacy.

In 2002, Pelosi opposed the Iraq Resolution authorizing President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq, which passed the House on a 296–133 vote. She said, &quot;unilateral use of force without first exhausting every diplomatic remedy and other remedies and making a case to the American people will be harmful to our war on terrorism.&quot;

==First tenure as minority leader (2003–2007)==
In November 2002, after Gephardt resigned as House minority leader to seek the Democratic nomination in the 2004 presidential election, Pelosi was elected to replace him, becoming the first woman to lead a major party in either chamber of Congress. In the campaign to succeed Gephardt as the House Democratic Caucus&#x27;s leader, Pelosi was challenged by Harold Ford Jr. and Marcy Kaptur. Kaptur withdrew her candidacy for the position before the November 15, 2002, caucus vote, and Pelosi defeated Ford 117–29 in the closed-door vote of caucus members. Critics of Pelosi characterized her as too liberal to be a successful House leader.

As minority leader, Pelosi sharply criticized the handling of the Iraq War by President Bush and his administration, in 2004 saying Bush had demonstrated areas of &quot;incompetence&quot;.

In a relative surprise, the Democratic Party lost three seats in the 2004 House elections, which coincided with Bush&#x27;s reelection as president. Focused on retaking the House majority in 2006, in her second term as minority leader Pelosi worked to criticize the Bush administration more effectively and to contrast the Democratic Party with it. As part of this, Pelosi voiced even harsher criticism of Bush&#x27;s handling of the Iraq War. In November 2005, prominent congressional Democrat John Murtha proposed that the U.S. begin a withdrawal of troops from Iraq at the &quot;earliest predictable date&quot;. Pelosi initially declined to commit to supporting Murtha&#x27;s proposal. Speaker Dennis Hastert soon brought to the floor a vote on a non-binding resolution calling for an immediate withdrawal of troops, seeking to trap Democrats into taking a more radical stance. Pelosi led Democrats in voting against the resolution, which failed in a 403–3 floor vote. Roughly two weeks later, Pelosi held a press conference in which she endorsed Murtha&#x27;s proposal. Some critics believed that Pelosi&#x27;s support for a troop withdrawal would prevent the Democrats from winning a House majority in the 2006 elections.

During her time as minority leader, Pelosi was not well known to much of the American public. Before the 2006 elections, Republicans made a concerted effort to taint public perception of her, running advertisements assailing her. Advertisements demonizing Pelosi became a routine part of Republican advertising in subsequent elections. For instance, during the 2022 election cycle, Republicans ran more than $50 million in ads that negatively characterized or invoked Pelosi, and in the 2010 cycle, they spent more than $65 million on such ads.

== First speakership (2007–2011) ==
=== 2007 speakership election ===

In the 2006 elections, the Democrats took control of the House, picking up 30 seats, the party&#x27;s largest House seat gain since the 1974 elections held in the wake of the Watergate scandal. The party&#x27;s House majority meant that as the party&#x27;s incumbent House leader, Pelosi was widely expected to become speaker in the next Congress. On November 16, 2006, the Democratic caucus unanimously nominated her for speaker.

Pelosi supported her longtime friend John Murtha for House majority leader, the second-ranking post in the House. His competitor was House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, who had been Pelosi&#x27;s second-in-command since 2003. Hoyer was elected House majority leader over Murtha by a margin of 149–86.

On January 4, 2007, Pelosi defeated Republican John Boehner of Ohio, 233 votes to 202, in the election for speaker of the House.

Rahm Emanuel, the incoming chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, nominated Pelosi, and her longtime friend John Dingell swore her in, as the dean of the House of Representatives traditionally does.

Pelosi was the first woman, the first Californian, and the first Italian-American to hold the speakership. She was also the second speaker from a state west of the Rocky Mountains. The first was Washington&#x27;s Tom Foley, the last Democrat to hold the post before Pelosi.

During her speech, she discussed the historical importance of being the first woman to hold the position of Speaker:

She also said Iraq was the major issue facing the 110th Congress while incorporating some Democratic Party beliefs:

As speaker, Pelosi remained the leader of the House Democrats, as the speaker is considered the leader of the majority caucus. But by tradition, she did not normally participate in debate and almost never voted on the floor, though she had the right to do so as a member of the House. She was also not a member of any House committees, also in keeping with tradition.

Pelosi was reelected speaker in 2009.

===Public perception===
During and after her first tenure as speaker, Pelosi was widely characterized as a polarizing political figure. Republican candidates often associated their Democratic opponents with her. Pelosi became the focus of heavy disdain by &quot;mainstream&quot; Republicans and Tea Party Republicans alike, as well as from the left.

As they had in 2006, Republicans continued to run advertisements that demonized Pelosi. Before the 2010 House elections, the Republican National Committee prominently used a &quot;Fire Pelosi&quot; slogan in its efforts to recapture the House majority. This slogan was rolled out hours after the House passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Republicans spent $65 million ahead of the 2010 elections on anti-Pelosi advertisements. Pelosi has continued to be a fixture of Republican attack. Ads demonizing her have been credited with fostering intense right-wing ire toward her, and have been seen as one of the top factors in her unpopularity with the public.

===Social Security===
Shortly after being reelected in 2004, President Bush claimed a mandate for an ambitious second-term agenda and proposed reforming Social Security by allowing workers to redirect a portion of their Social Security withholding into stock and bond investments. Pelosi strongly opposed the plan, saying there was no crisis, and as minority leader she imposed intense party discipline on her caucus, leading them to near-unanimous opposition to the proposal, which was defeated.

===Blocking of impeachment proceedings against President Bush===

In the wake of Bush&#x27;s 2004 reelection, several leading House Democrats believed they should pursue impeachment proceedings against him, asserting that he had misled Congress about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and violated Americans&#x27; civil liberties by authorizing warrantless wiretaps.

In May 2006, with an eye on the upcoming midterm elections—which offered the possibility of Democrats taking back control of the House for the first time since 1994—Pelosi told colleagues that, while the Democrats would conduct vigorous oversight of Bush administration policy, an impeachment investigation was &quot;off the table&quot;. A week earlier, she had told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that although Democrats would not set out to impeach Bush, &quot;you never know where&quot; investigations might lead.

After becoming speaker in 2007, Pelosi held firm against impeachment, notwithstanding strong support for it among her constituents. In the 2008 election, she withstood a challenge for her seat by antiwar activist Cindy Sheehan, who ran as an independent primarily because of Pelosi&#x27;s refusal to pursue impeachment.

===The &quot;Hundred Hours&quot;===
Before the midterm elections, Pelosi announced that if Democrats gained a House majority, they would push through most of their agenda during the first 100 hours of the 110th Congress.

The &quot;first hundred hours&quot; was a play on President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s promise for quick action to combat the Great Depression during his &quot;first hundred days&quot; in office. Newt Gingrich, who became speaker of the House in 1995, had a similar 100-day agenda to implement his Contract with America.

===Opposition to Iraq War troop surge of 2007===

On January 5, 2007, reacting to suggestions from Bush&#x27;s confidants that he would increase troop levels in Iraq (which he announced in a speech a few days later), Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid condemned the plan. They sent Bush a letter reading:

===2008 Democratic National Convention===
Pelosi was named Permanent Chair of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.

===Healthcare reform===

Pelosi has been credited for spearheading Obama&#x27;s health care law, the Affordable Care Act, when it seemed doomed to defeat. After Republican Scott Brown won Democrat Ted Kennedy&#x27;s former Senate seat in the January 2010 Massachusetts special election, costing Democrats their 60-seat filibuster-proof majority, Obama agreed with his then chief of staff Rahm Emanuel&#x27;s idea to do smaller initiatives that could pass easily. But Pelosi dismissed Obama&#x27;s compunction, mocking his scaled-back ideas as &quot;kiddie care&quot;. After convincing him that this was their only shot at health care reform because of the large Democratic majorities in Congress, she rallied her caucus as she began an &quot;unbelievable marathon&quot; of a two-month session to craft the bill, which passed the House 219–212. In Obama&#x27;s remarks before signing the bill into law, he called Pelosi &quot;one of the best speakers the House of Representatives has ever had.&quot;

===Assessments of first speakership===
By early 2010, analysts were assessing Pelosi as possibly the most powerful woman in U.S. history and among the most powerful speakers of the previous 100 years. In March 2010, Mark Shields wrote,

Later in 2010, Gail Russell Chaddock of &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; opined that Pelosi was the &quot;most powerful House speaker since Sam Rayburn a half century ago&quot;, adding that she had also been &quot;one of the most partisan&quot;. Scholars favorably assessed Pelosi&#x27;s first speakership. In late 2010, Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, opined that despite polarized public opinion of Pelosi, &quot;she&#x27;s going to rank quite high in the pantheon of modern speakers&quot;, declaring that the only speaker of the previous 100 years he would rank higher than Pelosi was Sam Rayburn. Catholic University of America political scientist Matthew Green opined that the 111th Congress had &quot;been remarkable in its productivity—in both the number of bills enacted and their scope—and Pelosi shares much of the credit.&quot; Green considered Pelosi&#x27;s tenure as speaker to be among the greatest in U.S. history, highlighting the passage of the Affordable Care Act (&quot;a measure with far-reaching implications for our nation&#x27;s health care policy&quot;). He also praised Pelosi for occasionally allowing House passage of measures that had majority overall House support but were opposed by the majority of the Democratic House Caucus. He noted that she had occasionally allowed bills to move forward in such fashion despite a high level of political polarization in the United States.

In November 2010, Brian Naylor of NPR opined that:

In November 2010, after Democrats lost their House majority, &quot;Politico&quot; writer John Bresnahan called Pelosi&#x27;s record as speaker &quot;mixed&quot;. He opined that Pelosi had been a powerful speaker, describing her as wielding &quot;an iron fist in a Gucci glove&quot; and having held &quot;enormous power within the House Democratic Caucus&quot;, but noting that she had a &quot;horrible approval rating with the rest of America&quot;. Bresnahan wrote that Pelosi&#x27;s leadership and the legislative agenda she advanced had significantly contributed to the party&#x27;s loss of its House majority, citing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as an example of legislation that hurt the Democrats electorally in 2010. Bresnahan also believed that, ahead of the 2010 elections, Pelosi had &quot;disastrously&quot; misread public opinion, and that Pelosi had been a poor orator.

Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution opined in 2018 that Pelosi had been the &quot;strongest and most effective speaker of modern times&quot; during her first speakership.

In 2018, Robert Draper wrote for &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;:

Draper also wrote that &quot;for all her mastery of Washington&#x27;s inside game, Pelosi has never been a deft public-facing politician,&quot; and called her a poor orator.

==Second tenure as minority leader (2011–2019)==
===112th and 113th Congress===
Though Pelosi was reelected by a comfortable margin in the 2010 elections, the Democrats lost 63 seats and control of the House of Representatives to the Republicans. After this setback, Pelosi sought to continue leading the House Democratic Caucus as minority leader, the office she held before becoming speaker. Intraparty opposition failed to pass a motion to delay the leadership vote, though she faced a challenge from Representative Heath Shuler. Shuler lost to Pelosi, 150–43, in the caucus vote on November 17, 2010. On the opening day of the 112th Congress, Pelosi was elected minority leader.

In November 2011, &quot;60 Minutes&quot; alleged that Pelosi and several other members of Congress had used information they gleaned from closed sessions to make money on the stock market. The program cited her purchases of Visa Inc. stock while a bill that would limit credit card fees was in the House. Pelosi denied the allegations and called the report &quot;a right-wing smear&quot;. When the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act (or STOCK Act) was introduced the next year, she voted for it and lauded its passing. Of representatives Louise Slaughter and Tim Walz, who drafted the bill, Pelosi said they &quot;shined a light on a gaping hole in our ethics laws and helped close it once and for all&quot;.

On November 14, 2012, Pelosi announced that she intended to remain Democratic leader.

Pelosi was one of many lawmakers who called for the Washington Redskins to change their name. She said it was time for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to step in and tell the National Football League that it could not keep its registered trademark for the &quot;Redskins&quot;, a racial slur for Native Americans.

===114th and 115th Congress===

In August 2016, Pelosi said that her personal contact information had been posted online following a cyberattack against top Democratic campaign committees and she had received &quot;obscene and sick calls, voice mails and text messages&quot;. She warned members of Congress to avoid letting children or family members answer phone calls or read text messages.

At times, centrists, progressive candidates and incumbent Democrats all expressed opposition to Pelosi&#x27;s continued tenure as the party&#x27;s House leader.

Prompted by colleagues after the 2016 presidential election, Tim Ryan of Ohio initiated a bid to replace Pelosi as House minority leader on November 17, 2016. After Pelosi agreed to give more leadership opportunities to junior members, she defeated Ryan by a vote of 134–63 on November 30.

In 2017, after Democrats lost four consecutive special elections in the House of Representatives, Pelosi&#x27;s leadership was again called into question. In June 2017, Representative Kathleen Rice of New York and a small group of other House Democrats, including Congressional Black Caucus chairman Cedric Richmond, held a closed-door meeting to discuss potential new Democratic leadership. Other House Democrats, including Ryan, Seth Moulton, and Filemon Vela, publicly called for new House leadership. In an interview, Rice said, &quot;If you were talking about a company that was posting losing numbers, if you were talking about any sports team that was losing time and time again, changes would be made, right? The CEO out. The coach would be out and there would be a new strategy put in place.&quot; In a press conference, Pelosi defended her leadership, saying, &quot;I respect any opinion that my members have but my decision about how long I stay is not up to them.&quot; When asked specifically why she should stay on as House minority leader after numerous Democratic seats were lost, she responded, &quot;Well, I&#x27;m a master legislator. I am a strategic, politically astute leader. My leadership is recognized by many around the country, and that is why I&#x27;m able to attract the support that I do.&quot;

In November 2017, after Pelosi called for John Conyers&#x27;s resignation over allegations of harassment, she convened the first in a series of planned meetings on strategies to address reforming workplace policies in the wake of national attention to sexual harassment. She said Congress had &quot;a moral duty to the brave women and men coming forward to seize this moment and demonstrate real, effective leadership to foster a climate of respect and dignity in the workplace&quot;.

In February 2018, Pelosi sent a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan about the proposed public release of a memo prepared by Republican staff at the direction of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes. The memo attacked the Federal Bureau of Investigation for its investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Pelosi said the FBI and the Department of Justice had warned Nunes and Ryan that the memo was inaccurate and that its release could threaten national security by disclosing federal surveillance methods. She added that Republicans were engaged in a &quot;cover-up campaign&quot; to protect Trump: &quot;House Republicans&#x27; pattern of obstruction and cover-up to hide the truth about the Trump-Russia scandal represents a threat to our intelligence and our national security. The GOP has led a partisan effort to distort intelligence and discredit the U.S. law enforcement and intelligence communities.&quot; She charged Nunes with &quot;deliberately dishonest actions&quot; and called for his immediate removal from his position.

In February 2018, Pelosi broke the record for longest House speech using the &quot;magic minute&quot; custom when she spent more than eight hours recounting stories from DREAMers—people brought to the United States as minors by undocumented immigrants—to object to a budget deal that would raise spending caps without addressing the future of DACA recipients, who were at risk of deportation by the Trump administration.

In May 2018, after the White House invited two Republicans and no Democrats to a Department of Justice briefing on an FBI informant who had made contact with the Trump campaign, Pelosi and Schumer sent a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI director Wray calling for &quot;a bipartisan Gang of Eight briefing that involves congressional leadership from both chambers&quot;.

In August 2018, Pelosi called for Duncan D. Hunter&#x27;s resignation after his indictment on charges of misusing at least $250,000 in campaign funds, saying the charges were &quot;evidence of the rampant culture of corruption among Republicans in Washington today&quot;.

In April 2018, Peter Beinart wrote in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; that Pelosi had been &quot;the most effective congressional leader of modern times—and, not coincidentally, the most vilified.&quot;

==Second speakership (2019–2023)==

In the 2018 elections, the Democrats recaptured a House majority, gaining 41 seats. This was the party&#x27;s largest gain in the House since the 1974 post-Watergate elections. On November 28, House Democrats nominated Pelosi to once again serve as speaker. She was reelected to the speakership at the start of the 116th Congress on January 3, 2019. Pelosi &quot;clinched the speakership after weeks of whittling down opposition from some fellow Democrats seeking a new generation of leadership. The deal to win over holdouts put an expiration date on her tenure: she promised not to stay more than four years in the job&quot;. 220 House Democrats voted for Pelosi as Speaker and 15 for someone else or no one.

On February 4, 2020, at the conclusion of Trump&#x27;s State of the Union address, Pelosi tore up her official copy of it. Her stated reason for doing so was &quot;because it was a courteous thing to do considering the alternatives. It was a such a dirty speech&quot;. Trump and other Republicans criticized her for this.

In December 2021, Pelosi announced her candidacy for reelection to the House in 2022. In 2018, and again in 2020, she had agreed not to stay on as speaker beyond January 2023, but otherwise avoided questions about her future. In 2022, Pelosi was reelected, but the Democratic Party lost the House majority. Ten days later, she announced that she would not seek a Democratic leadership post in the next Congress.

=== 2018–2019 government shutdown ===

At the start of the 116th Congress, Pelosi opposed Trump&#x27;s attempts to use the 2018–2019 federal government shutdown (which she called a &quot;hostage-taking&quot; of civil servants) as leverage to build a substantial wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. She declined to allow Trump to give the State of the Union Address in the House chamber while the shutdown was ongoing. After several polls showed Trump&#x27;s popularity sharply falling due to the shutdown, on January 25, 2019, Trump signed a stopgap bill to reopen the government without any concessions regarding a border wall for three weeks to allow negotiations on an appropriations bill. But he reiterated his demand for border wall funding and said he would shut the government down again or declare a national emergency and use military funding to build the wall if Congress did not appropriate the funds by February 15.

On February 15, Trump declared a national emergency in order to bypass Congress, after being unsatisfied with a bipartisan bill that had passed the House and Senate the day before.
=== Impeachments of President Trump ===
On September 29, 2019, Pelosi announced the launch of an impeachment inquiry against Trump. On December 5, 2019, after the inquiry had taken place, Pelosi authorized the Judiciary Committee to begin drafting articles of impeachment. After hearings were held, two articles of impeachment were announced on December 10. The House of Representatives approved both articles on December 18, thereby formally impeaching Trump.

The day after the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Pelosi demanded that Trump either resign or be removed from office through the clauses of section four the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, threatening impeachment if this did not happen. On January 10, she issued a 24-hour ultimatum to Vice President Mike Pence, that if he did not invoke the 25th amendment, she would proceed with legislation to impeach Trump. On January 13, the House voted to impeach Trump a second time.

=== COVID-19 pandemic and response ===

Pelosi facilitated passage of the CARES Act. She attracted controversy when footage emerged in early September 2020 of her visiting a hair salon in San Francisco. This was contrary to regulations enforced at that time preventing service indoors. Criticized for hypocrisy by Trump and the owners of the salon, Pelosi described the situation as &quot;clearly a setup&quot;. Her stylist and other Democrats defended her.

===Infrastructure bill===
Pelosi played a key role in the 2021 passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; credited the legislation&#x27;s passage to Pelosi&#x27;s decision to adopt a Congressional Black Caucus proposal to pair together the final vote on the bill with a good-faith vote on the rules governing debate on a subsequent social safety net bill. The Times noted that Pelosi did not make herself the public face of this, instead having Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Joyce Beatty persuade House Democratic Caucus members to accept the proposal. The &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;in effect, the speaker had harnessed one faction of her unruly Democrats to win over two others.&quot; Chris Cillizza of CNN wrote:

===Other notable legislation===
During the 117th Congress, the CHIPS and Science Act, Inflation Reduction Act, and Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 (PACT Act) were passed.

===Assessments of second speakership===

As with her first tenure, experts gave Pelosi&#x27;s second tenure as speaker high marks, with many opining that during her two tenures as speaker she had been among the most effective individuals to hold the position.

In June 2019, Brent Budowsky opined in &quot;The Hill&quot; that Pelosi had been &quot;the most important, consequential and effective Speaker since Tip O&#x27;Neill&quot; as well as &quot;one of the greatest Speakers who ever served.&quot; In January 2020, on the eve of Trump&#x27;s first impeachment trial before the U.S. Senate, &quot;Washington Post&quot; political writer Paul Kane called Pelosi the most powerful House speaker in at least 25 years, noting that some historians were comparing her influence to that of former speaker Sam Rayburn. In 2021, former Republican speaker John Boehner opined that Pelosi had been the most powerful House speaker in U.S. history.

In November 2022, Chris Cillizza wrote that Pelosi was &quot;the most effective speaker ever.&quot; Johnathan Bernstein opined for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; that Pelosi was &quot;the greatest speaker in history.&quot; Jackie Calmes of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; shared the same opinion. Sarah Ferris of &quot;Politico&quot; called Pelosi &quot;a legislative giant regarded as one of the most powerful speakers in modern U.S. history.&quot; Historian Lindsay M. Chervinsky wrote for NBC News that Pelosi was &quot;one of the most effective speakers in history&quot; and had been so while facing &quot;the double standards that apply to powerful women.&quot;

John Haduk wrote for the Brookings Institution:

A number of progressive and liberal-leaning outlets published strong assessments of Pelosi&#x27;s tenure. Harold Meyerson opined that Pelosi had been the greatest speaker in U.S. history in an article in &quot;The American Prospect&quot;. Amanda Marcotte of &quot;Salon.com&quot; opined that Pelosi was the greatest speaker of all time, calling her &quot;both the most effective and most progressive House speaker of all time.&quot; Marcotte added that Pelosi had been effective &quot;both in terms of managing an unruly caucus and being able to push her party in more progressive directions.&quot;

==Post-Democratic leadership (2023–present)==
On November 29, 2022, the Steering and Policy Committee of the House Democratic Caucus honorarily named Pelosi &quot;speaker emerita&quot; in the upcoming 118th U.S. Congress. Her second speakership, and her participation in the House Democratic Party leadership, concluded on January 3, 2023, at the end of the 117th Congress.

Amid concerns about President Biden&#x27;s reelection prospects in the 2024 presidential election, Pelosi played a key role in the effort to pressure him to withdraw his candidacy before the Democratic National Convention. She personally warned Biden that she feared his faltering candidacy might not only result in Trump&#x27;s victory but also have a coattail effect that could bring Democrats defeat in the coinciding House and Senate elections and give Republicans a government trifecta. When Democratic members of Congress privately sought her guidance on how to handle their concerns, Pelosi advised them &quot;speak their conscience&quot;. On the July 10 edition of &quot;MSNBC’s Morning Joe&quot;, Pelosi said the party encouraged Biden to make the decision because time was running out. Later that day, Pelosi&#x27;s office stated: &quot;Speaker Pelosi fully supports whatever President Biden decides to do. We must turn our attention to why this race is so important: Donald Trump would be a disaster for our country and our democracy.&quot; The growing number of members of Congress calling for Biden to withdraw heightened the pressure on him. Biden withdrew his candidacy on July 21 and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the party&#x27;s presidential nominee. Before Biden withdrew, Pelosi had expressed to other California congressional Democrats her belief that the possible selection of a new nominee should be done competitively through an &quot;open process&quot;. She briefly held off from endorsing Harris&#x27;s candidacy before doing so the next day. Although Harris did not win any primary elections, Pelosi insisted that the process that led to Harris&#x27;s nomination was a &quot;primary&quot;. She told &quot;Semafor&quot; on September 18 that Harris earned her nomination because &quot;We had an open primary, and she won it. Nobody else got in the race.&quot; After Harris lost to Trump, Pelosi blamed Biden&#x27;s late exit from the race and the lack of an open Democratic primary.

=== Committee assignments and caucus memberships ===
In the House, Pelosi served on the Appropriations and Intelligence Committees and was the ranking member on the latter until her election as minority leader. She is a member of the House Baltic Caucus and the Congressional Equality Caucus.

===Role as a Democratic Party fundraiser===
Early in her political career, Pelosi established herself as a prominent fundraiser in the party. She was one of the party&#x27;s most prolific fundraisers, transferring significant funds to committees for other candidates. During the 2000 and 2002 election cycles, among members of Congress, she contributed the most money to other congressional campaigns. In 2006, Pelosi was the Democratic Party&#x27;s third-largest fundraiser, behind former first couple Bill and Hillary Clinton. From 2003 to 2014, Pelosi raised more than $400 million in campaign funds.

==Political positions==

Pelosi was a founding member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which she left in 2003 after being elected House minority leader. She is still widely considered a liberal.

===Civil liberties and human rights===

In 2001, she voted in favor of the USA Patriot Act, but voted against reauthorization of certain provisions in 2005. She voted against a Constitutional amendment banning flag-burning.

====Immigration====

Pelosi voted against the Secure Fence Act of 2006.

In June 2018, Pelosi visited a federal facility used to detain migrant children separated from their parents and subsequently called for the resignation of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. In July, Pelosi characterized the compromise immigration bill by the Republicans as a &quot;deal with the devil&quot; and said she had not had conversations with House Speaker Ryan about a legislative solution to the separation of families at the southern border.

In April 2021, after southern border crossings peaked, House Republicans criticized Pelosi for saying that immigration under the Biden administration was &quot;on a good path&quot;. U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that nearly 19,000 unaccompanied minors arrived in March.

====LGBT rights====

Pelosi has long supported LGBT rights. In 1996, she voted against the Defense of Marriage Act, and in 2004 and 2006, she voted against the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment, which would amend the United States Constitution to define marriage federally as being between one man and one woman, thereby overriding states&#x27; individual rights to legalize same-sex marriage. When the Supreme Court of California overturned the state&#x27;s ban on marriage between same-sex couples in 2008, Pelosi released a statement welcoming the &quot;historic decision&quot;. She also indirectly voiced her opposition to California Proposition 8, a successful 2008 state ballot initiative which defined marriage in California as a union between one man and one woman.

In 2012, Pelosi said her position on LGBT rights such as same-sex marriage grows from and reflects her Catholic faith; it also places her at odds with Catholic doctrine, which defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman. She said: &quot;My religion compels me—and I love it for it—to be against discrimination of any kind in our country, and I consider [the ban on gay marriage] a form of discrimination. I think it&#x27;s unconstitutional on top of that.&quot;

Pelosi supports the Equality Act, a bill that would expand the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In 2019, she spoke in Congress in favor of the bill and called for ending discrimination against LGBT people. Pelosi also opposed Trump&#x27;s transgender military ban.

====Marijuana====
Pelosi supports reform in marijuana laws, although NORML&#x27;s deputy director Paul Armentano said she and other members of Congress had not done anything to change the laws. She also supports use of medical marijuana.

====PRISM====
As of 2014, Pelosi supported the Bush/Obama NSA surveillance program PRISM.

==== Removal from the Capitol of art depicting Confederates ====
Pelosi repeatedly criticized the fact that the United States Capitol exhibited artworks depicting people who in various capacities supported the Confederacy in the American Civil War. In 2017, this included at least 10 statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection, either in the National Statuary Hall itself or some less prominent Capitol rooms. Almost all the statues in that collection were selected and donated by the states (two from each state) and could only be exchanged for others by an ordered process involving the consent of the states&#x27; legislatures and governors, but the speaker of the House directly could influence their precise placement.

During her first tenure as speaker, Pelosi moved the statue of Robert E. Lee from the National Statuary Hall of the U.S. Capitol to the Capitol crypt. In August 2017, she supported an initiative by Senator Cory Booker to have Confederate monuments and memorials removed from the Capitol Building by means of legislation.

In June 2020, following the nationwide protests over the murder of George Floyd, Pelosi pushed for the removal of all statues of Confederates from the Capitol. On June 18, Pelosi also ordered that four paintings of former Confederates in the Capitol Speaker&#x27;s Gallery be taken down. &quot;We didn&#x27;t know about this until we were taking inventory of the statues and the curator told us that there were four paintings of Speakers in the Capitol of the United States, four Speakers who had served in the Confederacy&quot;, Pelosi told reporters.

====Waterboarding====

In 2002, while Pelosi was the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, she was briefed on the ongoing use of &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot;, including waterboarding, authorized for a captured terrorist, Abu Zubaydah. After the briefing, Pelosi said she &quot;was assured by lawyers with the CIA and the Department of Justice that the methods were legal&quot;. Two unnamed former Bush administration officials say the briefing was detailed and graphic, and at the time she did not raise substantial objections. One unnamed U.S. official present during the early briefings said, &quot;In fairness, the environment was different then because we were closer to September 11 and people were still in a panic. But there was no objecting, no hand-wringing. The attitude was, &#x27;We don&#x27;t care what you do to those guys as long as you get the information you need to protect the American people.

These techniques later became controversial, and in 2007 Pelosi&#x27;s office said she had protested their use at the time, and she concurred with objections raised by Democratic colleague Jane Harman in a letter to the CIA in early 2003. Subsequently, several leading Democratic lawmakers in the House signed a letter on June 26, 2009, alleging CIA Director Leon Panetta had asserted that the CIA misled Congress for a &quot;number of years&quot; spanning back to 2001, casting clouds on the controversy. The letter, lawmakers and the CIA all providing no details, and the circumstances surrounding the allegations, make it hard to assess the claims and counterclaims of both sides.

Officials in Congress say her ability to challenge the practices may have been hampered by strict rules of secrecy that prohibited her from taking notes or consulting legal experts or members of her own staffs. In an April 2009 press conference, Pelosi said: &quot;In that or any other briefing... we were not, and I repeat, were not told that waterboarding or any of these other enhanced interrogation techniques were used. What they did tell us is that they had some legislative counsel—the Office of Legislative Counsel opinions that they could be used, but not that they would. And they further [...] the point was that if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time.&quot;

===Economy===
====Fiscal policy====

Pelosi voted against the 1995 Balanced Budget Proposed Constitutional Amendment, which passed the House by a 300–132 vote, but fell two votes short of the 2/3 supermajority required in the Senate (with 65 senators voting in favor).

As Speaker of the House, she spearheaded the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 as part of the 100-Hour Plan. The act raises the minimum wage in the United States and the territories of the Northern Marianas Islands and American Samoa. American Samoa was initially absent from the act, but it was included as part of HR 2206. One Republican congressman who voted against the initial bill accused Pelosi of unethically benefiting Del Monte Foods (headquartered in her district) by excluding the territory, where Del Monte&#x27;s StarKist Tuna brand is a major employer. Pelosi co-sponsored legislation that omitted American Samoa from a raise in the minimum wage as early as 1999, before Del Monte&#x27;s acquisition of StarKist Tuna in 2002.

Pelosi opposed the welfare reform President Bush proposed as well as reforms proposed and passed under President Clinton. She also opposed the tax reform signed by Trump in December 2017, calling it &quot;probably one of the worst bills in the history of the United States of America... It robs from the future [and] it rewards the rich... and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle-class families in our country.&quot; She said &quot;this is Armageddon&quot; and argued that the tax bill increased the debt in a way that would adversely impact social insurance spending. In January 2018, shortly after the tax bill passed, a reporter asked Pelosi to respond to statements by companies crediting the tax cuts with allowing them to raise wages and give bonuses. She said that, given the benefits corporations received from the tax bill, the benefits workers got were &quot;crumbs&quot;. Most companies that awarded bonuses gave out payments of hundreds of dollars, while some gave bonuses significantly over $1,000.

====Infrastructure====

In November 2018, Pelosi said she had spoken with Trump about infrastructure development. Though he &quot;really didn&#x27;t come through with it in his first two years in office&quot; while it was a topic during his campaign, the subject had not been a partisan matter in Congress. She mentioned potential bipartisan legislative initiatives that would &quot;create good paying jobs and will also generate other economic growth in their regions&quot;. On May 1, 2019, Pelosi and Schumer met with Trump about infrastructure funding. In late May, a meeting to discuss an impending $2trillion infrastructure plan was cut short when Trump abruptly left after only a few minutes.

====Disaster relief====

In August 2018, after Trump signed an emergency declaration for federal aid in combating the Carr Fire in Northern California, Pelosi called the move &quot;an important first step&quot; but requested that Trump accede to California Governor Jerry Brown&#x27;s request for further aid to other hard-hit areas in California. She called on the Trump administration to take &quot;real, urgent action to combat the threat of the climate crisis, which is making the wildfire season longer, more expensive and more destructive&quot;.

===Education===

In 1999, Pelosi voted against displaying the Ten Commandments in public buildings, including schools. She voted for the No Child Left Behind Act, which instituted testing to track students&#x27; progress and authorized an increase in overall education spending.

===Environment===

In 2019, Pelosi said climate change was &quot;the existential threat of our time&quot; and called for action to curb it. She has supported the development of new technologies to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil and remediate the adverse environmental effects of burning fossil fuels. Pelosi has widely supported conservation programs and energy research appropriations. She has also voted to remove an amendment that would allow for oil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

Pelosi has blocked efforts to revive offshore oil drilling in protected areas, reasoning that offshore drilling could lead to an increase in dependence on fossil fuels.

===Health care===
====Affordable Care Act====

Pelosi was instrumental in passing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. She was a key figure in convincing Obama to continue pushing for health-care reform after the election of Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown in a January special election—a defeat seen as potentially fatal to Democratic reform efforts. After delivering 219 votes in the House for Obama&#x27;s health-care package, Pelosi was both praised and heckled as she made her way to Capitol Hill.

Pelosi has voted to increase Medicare and Medicaid benefits. She does not endorse Senator Bernie Sanders&#x27;s bill for single-payer healthcare.

On March 10, 2017, Pelosi said Democrats would continue battling Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but would also be willing to form a compromise measure if Republicans reached out for support. She indicated her support for the Republican plan to expand Health Savings Accounts and said the question of Republicans&#x27; accepting an expansion of Medicaid was important. In September, Pelosi sent a letter to Democrats praising Senator John McCain for announcing his opposition to the latest Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and called on lawmakers and advocacy groups alike to pressure Republicans in the health-care discussion. She said Democrats would be unified in putting &quot;a stake in the heart of this monstrous bill&quot;.

In July 2018, during a speech at Independence First, Pelosi said Democrats&#x27; goal &quot;has always been to expand coverage and to do so in a way that improves benefits... and we have to address the affordability issue that is so undermined by the Republicans.&quot; In November 2018, after Democrats gained a majority in the House in the midterm elections, she said, &quot;I&#x27;m staying as Speaker to protect the Affordable Care Act. That&#x27;s my main issue, because I think that&#x27;s, again, about the health and financial health of the America&#x27;s families, and if Hillary had won, I could go home.&quot; She added that Republicans had misrepresented their earlier position of opposition to covering people with preexisting conditions during the election cycle and called on them to join Democrats in &quot;removing all doubt that the preexisting medical condition is the law—the benefit—is the law of the land&quot;.

====Abortion====

Pelosi voted against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 and earlier attempts at similar bans, and voted against the criminalization of certain situations where a minor is transported across state lines for an abortion (HR 748, passed).

She has voted in favor of lifting the ban on privately funded abortions at overseas U.S. military facilities (HA 209, rejected); in favor of an amendment that would repeal a provision forbidding servicewomen and dependents from getting an abortion in overseas military hospitals (HA 722, rejected); and in favor of stripping the prohibition of funding for organizations working overseas that use their own funds to provide abortion services, or engage in advocacy related to abortion services (HA 997, rejected). She also voted in favor of the 1998 Abortion Funding Amendment, which would have allowed the use of district funds to promote abortion-related activities, but would have prohibited the use of federal funds.

In 2008, she was rebuked by Archbishop Donald Wuerl of Washington, D.C., for being &quot;incorrect&quot; in comments she made to Tom Brokaw on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; concerning Church teaching on the subjects of abortion of when a human life begins. The archbishop&#x27;s statement quoted Pelosi as saying the church has not been able to define when life begins. During the interview she said, &quot;over the history of the church, this [what constitutes the moment of conception] is an issue of controversy.&quot; In February 2009, Pelosi met with her bishop, Archbishop George Hugh Niederauer of San Francisco, and with Pope Benedict XVI regarding the controversy.

Pelosi opposed the 2022 overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, calling it &quot;cruel&quot;, &quot;outrageous&quot; and &quot;heart-wrenching&quot;.

====Contraception====

In a January 25, 2009, interview with George Stephanopoulos for ABC News, Pelosi said that one of the reasons she supported family planning services was that they would &quot;reduce costs to states and to the federal government.&quot;

===Security===
====Gun laws====

Pelosi stands in favor of increased background checks for potential gun owners, as well as the banning of assault weapons. In February 2013, she called for the &quot;Boldest possible move&quot; on gun control, similar to a stance made just weeks earlier by former Representative, mass shooting victim, and fellow gun control advocate Gabby Giffords. In 2012, she was given a 0% rating by Gun Owners of America and a 7% rating from the National Rifle Association of America for her stances on gun control.

In February 2018, following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Pelosi said Republicans&#x27; &quot;cowering&quot; to the gun lobby was &quot;an assault on our whole country&quot; and that the victims were &quot;paying the price for our inaction&quot;. She requested House Speaker Ryan and Republicans take action via consideration of legislation expanding background checks or authorizing researchers to use federal dollars to examine public health as it relates to gun violence. Pelosi also advocated for the creation of a special committee on gun violence and said Republicans had previously created committees to investigate Planned Parenthood and the 2012 Benghazi attack.

In November 2018, after the Thousand Oaks shooting, Pelosi released a statement saying Americans &quot;deserve real action to end the daily epidemic of gun violence that is stealing the lives of our children on campuses, in places of worship and on our streets&quot; and pledged that gun control would be a priority for House Democrats in the 116th United States Congress.

====Military draft====

With regard to Representative Charles Rangel&#x27;s (D-NY) plan to introduce legislation that would reinstate the draft, Pelosi said she did not support it.

====Use of government aircraft====

In March 2009, conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch had obtained emails sent by Pelosi&#x27;s staff requesting the United States Air Force (USAF) to provide specific aircraft—a Boeing 757—for Pelosi to use for taxpayer-funded travel. Pelosi responded that the policy was initiated by President Bush due to post-9/11 security concerns (Pelosi was third in line for presidential succession), and was initially provided for the previous Speaker Dennis Hastert. The Sergeant at Arms requested—for security reasons—that the plane provided be capable of non-stop flight, requiring a larger aircraft. The Pentagon said &quot;no one has rendered judgment&quot; that Pelosi&#x27;s use of aircraft &quot;is excessive&quot;.

===First Trump presidency===

During the first Trump administration, Pelosi voted in line with the president&#x27;s stated position 17.6% of the time.

During a news conference on June 9, 2017, after a reporter asked her about tweets by President Donald Trump lambasting former FBI director James Comey following Comey&#x27;s testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee, Pelosi said no one at the White House seemed courageous enough to tell Trump his tweets were beneath the dignity of the presidency and that she was worried about his fitness for office. In November, when asked about Democrats beginning the impeachment process against Trump in the event they won a majority of seats in the 2018 elections, Pelosi said it would not be one of their legislative priorities but that the option could be considered if credible evidence appeared during the ongoing investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

In January 2018, Pelosi referred to Trump&#x27;s 2018 State of the Union Address as a performance without serious policy ideas the parties could collaborate on. She questioned Trump&#x27;s refusal to implement Russian sanctions after more than 500 members of Congress voted to approve them. In February, after Trump blocked the release of a Democratic memo by the Intelligence Committee, Pelosi said the act was &quot;a stunningly brazen attempt to cover up the truth about the Trump-Russia scandal from the American people&quot; and &quot;part of a dangerous and desperate pattern of cover-up on the part of the president who has shown he had something to hide.&quot; In March, Pelosi said she was &quot;more concerned about the president&#x27;s policies which undermine the financial security of America&#x27;s working families&quot; than the Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal. Pelosi did note the scandal as having highlighted a double standard of Republicans on issues of family values and expectations of presidential behavior, saying the party would be very involved if the event was happening to a Democrat. In April, following Scooter Libby being pardoned by Trump, Pelosi released a statement saying the pardon &quot;sends a troubling signal to the president&#x27;s allies that obstructing justice will be rewarded and that the idea of those who lie under oath being granted a pardon &quot;poses a threat to the integrity of the special counsel investigation, and to our democracy&quot;. On August 15, after Trump revoked the security clearance of former CIA director John Brennan, Pelosi said the move was &quot;a stunning abuse of power [and] a pathetic attempt to silence critics&quot;, and an attempt by Trump to distract attention from other issues of his administration. Pelosi and Charles E. Schumer met with Trump and Pence in December 2018 to discuss changes to be made when the new Democratic representatives takes office in 2019. In January 2019 she supported President Trump in his decision to back the leader of the opposition Juan Guaidó during Venezuelan protests and constitutional crisis.
====Trump–Ukraine scandal and impeachment====

The Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives in the November 2018 elections, and Pelosi took office as Speaker. Multiple House committees launched investigations into various actions by Trump and some of his cabinet members and requested or subpoenaed documents and information from the White House and the administration. In April 2019, Trump vowed to defy &quot;all&quot; subpoenas from the House and to refuse to allow current or former administration officials to testify before House committees.

Pelosi initially resisted efforts by some fellow House Democrats to pursue Trump&#x27;s impeachment, but in September 2019, following revelations of the Trump–Ukraine scandal, announced the beginning of a formal House impeachment inquiry, saying &quot;The actions taken to date by the president have seriously violated the Constitution&quot; and that Trump &quot;must be held accountable—no one is above the law.&quot; Privately, Pelosi expressed concern that focusing on impeachment would imperil the Democrats&#x27; House majority; she preferred to focus on other legislation.

In May 2019, the White House intervened to halt former White House Counsel Don McGahn from complying with a subpoena issued by the House Judiciary Committee, instructing the committee to redirect its records requests to the White House. Pelosi, who had previously urged &quot;Democrats to focus on fact-finding rather than the prospect of any impeachment&quot;, described Trump&#x27;s interference regarding McGahn&#x27;s records as an obstruction of justice, saying that &quot;Trump is goading us to impeach him.&quot; Later that month, as the Trump administration continued to ignore subpoenas, refuse to release documents, and encourage or order current and former officials not to testify in Congress, Pelosi declared: &quot;we believe that the president of the United States is engaged in a cover-up.&quot; Later that day, after learning of Pelosi&#x27;s comments, Trump walked away from a scheduled White House meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, in which a $2trillion infrastructure plan was supposed to be discussed. Trump told Pelosi and Schumer he could not work with them until they stopped investigating him. Later in the day, Pelosi accused Trump of &quot;obstructing justice&quot; and again said he &quot;is engaged in a cover-up&quot;. On June 5, 2019, during a meeting with senior Democrats about whether the House should launch impeachment proceeding against Trump, Pelosi said, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison.&quot; According to multiple sources, rather than impeachment, she wanted to see Trump lose to a Democrat in the 2020 election, following which he could be prosecuted. Eventually, under pressure from an alliance of left-wing Representatives led by Chair of the House Judiciary Committee Jerry Nadler, Pelosi backed an impeachment inquiry.

The House impeachment inquiry focused on efforts by Trump and Trump administration officials to pressure the government of Ukraine to smear former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival of Trump&#x27;s, while withholding $400million in U.S. military aid, and a White House visit, from Ukraine; the inquiry also examined Trump&#x27;s request in a July 2019 phone call to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to &quot;do us a favor&quot; and investigate Biden. On December 18, 2019, the House voted nearly along party lines to impeach Trump for abuse of power (230–197) and obstruction of Congress (229–198), making him the third president in U.S. history to be impeached. Pelosi said, when opening debate on the articles of impeachment, &quot;If we do not act now, we would be derelict in our duty. It is tragic that the president&#x27;s reckless actions make impeachment necessary. He gave us no choice.&quot; Pelosi initially did not transmit the articles of impeachment to the Republican-controlled Senate for trial, seeking to negotiate an agreement with Senate Majority Mitch McConnell for the Senate to hear witness testimony and other additional evidence as part of a bid for a &quot;full and fair&quot; trial. McConnell rejected these efforts, and the House transmitted the articles to the Senate on January 15, 2020, with Pelosi naming seven Democratic Representatives, led by Representative Adam Schiff, as the House managers to argue the impeachment case against Trump in the Senate. As expected, the Senate ultimately acquitted Trump in a nearly-party line vote in which every Democrat voted for conviction and all but one Republican, Senator Mitt Romney, voting for acquittal. Ahead of the Senate vote Pelosi said that, irrespective of the outcome, the president &quot;has been impeached forever&quot;, that the impeachment process had successfully &quot;pulled back a veil of behavior totally unacceptable to our founders, and that the public will see this with a clearer eye, an unblurred eye.&quot; Following the Senate vote, Pelosi criticized Trump and Senate Republicans, saying their actions had &quot;normalized lawlessness and rejected the system of checks and balances&quot;.

Following the Senate vote, Trump claimed vindication and criticized Democrats, the FBI, and Pelosi. In a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast, Trump referred to Pelosi as &quot;a horrible person&quot;, and questioned her religious faith; Pelosi said these remarks were &quot;particularly without class&quot;. Before Trump&#x27;s February 4, 2020 State of the Union Address, the day before the Senate impeachment vote, Trump and Pelosi exchanged mutual snubs. Trump refused to shake Pelosi&#x27;s outstretched hand, and Pelosi tore up her copy of Trump&#x27;s speech. Her stated reason for doing so was &quot;because it was a courteous thing to do considering the alternatives. It was a such a dirty speech.&quot; Pelosi also said Trump&#x27;s speech &quot;had no contact with reality whatsoever&quot; and suggested the president appeared &quot;a little sedated&quot; during the address. Pelosi&#x27;s action was criticized by Trump and others.

Days after the Senate impeachment vote, Trump fired two officials who had testified against him during the impeachment inquiry: U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official. Pelosi called the firing of Vindman a &quot;shameful&quot; and &quot;clear and brazen act of retaliation that showcases the President&#x27;s fear of the truth&quot;, saying that &quot;History will remember Lieutenant Colonel Vindman as an American hero.&quot;

====Commission to consider use of 25th Amendment====

On October 8, 2020, Pelosi announced that legislation was being introduced in the House of Representatives to advance the creation of a commission to allow the use of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution to intervene and remove Trump from executive duties.

===Biden presidency===
As of October 2022, Pelosi had voted in line with Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100% of the time.

===Foreign affairs===

==== China/Hong Kong/Taiwan ====

After the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, Pelosi sought to take a harsher position toward China than President George H.W. Bush. With the support of Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, she took a lead role for the Democrats in criticizing Bush&#x27;s China policy. Pelosi&#x27;s view was that Congress should oppose the annual presidential waiver for China under the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, an amendment to the Trade Act of 1974 that required the president to inform Congress if he intended to waive the Act to have a most favored nation trading relationship with a non-market economy. Pelosi said that if China&#x27;s economy suffered, Chinese people would be unhappy with their government and this would serve to advance democracy in China.

As part of a Congressional delegation, Pelosi unfurled a banner in the square in 1991, provoking a confrontation with Chinese police. She advocated for Chinese political prisoners and dissidents to be able to come to the U.S. In 1999, ahead of Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji&#x27;s visit to the U.S. for talks over World Trade Organization admission for China, Pelosi called on President Clinton and Vice President Gore to ask Zhu to recognize the 1989 protests as a pro-democracy effort.

In 2008, after a meeting with the Dalai Lama and officials in the Tibetan government-in-exile, Pelosi criticized the People&#x27;s Republic of China for its handling of the unrest in Tibet; addressing a crowd of thousands of Tibetans in Dharamsala, India, Pelosi called on &quot;freedom-loving people&quot; worldwide to denounce China for its human rights abuses in Tibet. The same year, Pelosi commended the European Parliament for its &quot;bold decision&quot; to award the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to Chinese dissident and human rights activist Hu Jia, and called upon the Chinese government &quot;to immediately and unconditionally release Hu Jia from prison and to respect the fundamental freedoms of all the people in China.&quot;

In 2010, Pelosi backed a bill naming China a currency manipulator, which would appease exporters.

Pelosi criticized the imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists in August 2017 for their roles in a protest at the Civic Square in front of the Central Government Complex in Hong Kong. She called the ruling an injustice that should &quot;shock the conscience of the world&quot;.

Before the Trump administration took concrete measures against China in late March 2018, Pelosi and other Democratic leaders pressed Trump to focus more on China and impose real punishments, such as fulfilling his own campaign commitments to name China a currency manipulator and stop China from pressuring U.S. tech companies into giving up intellectual property rights. Pelosi urged Trump to take a strong stand against unfair market barriers in China.

In September 2019, Pelosi met with Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong on Capitol Hill; Chinese media responded by accusing Pelosi of &quot;backing and encouraging radical activists&quot;.

On the eve of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, Pelosi advised American athletes competing: &quot;I would say to our athletes, &#x27;You&#x27;re there to compete. Do not risk incurring the anger of the Chinese government, because they are ruthless.

On August 2, 2022, Pelosi became the highest-ranking U.S. government official to visit Taiwan in 25 years. President Joe Biden discouraged but did not prevent Pelosi from traveling to Taiwan, and the White House later affirmed her right to visit. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and 25 Senate Republicans backed Pelosi&#x27;s decision to visit, issuing a joint statement that also supported the trip. Her trip triggered a new round of hostilities in the already tense relationship between the U.S. and China. During and after her visit, China undertook a series of retaliatory measures against Taiwan and the United States. Pelosi said her visit was a sign of the U.S. Congress&#x27;s commitment to Taiwan. During her visit, she met with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-Wen and called Taiwan one of the &quot;freest societies in the world&quot;. On August 5, 2022, the Chinese government sanctioned Pelosi for &quot;seriously interfering in China&#x27;s internal affairs, undermining China&#x27;s sovereignty and territorial integrity, trampling on the one-China policy, and threatening the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait&quot;.

====Colombia====
Pelosi publicly scolded Colombian president Álvaro Uribe during Uribe&#x27;s May 2007 state visit to America. Pelosi met with Uribe and later released a statement that she and other members of Congress had &quot;expressed growing concerns about the serious allegations&quot; of links between paramilitary groups and Colombian government officials. Pelosi also came out against the Colombian free-trade agreement.

====Cuba====
In 2008, Pelosi said: &quot;For years, I have opposed the embargo on Cuba. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been successful, and I think we have to remove the travel bans and have more exchanges—people to people exchanges with Cuba.&quot; In 2015, Pelosi supported President Obama&#x27;s Cuban Thaw, a rapprochement between the U.S. and Castro&#x27;s regime in Cuba, and visited Havana for meetings with high-level officials.

====First Gulf War====
Pelosi opposed U.S. intervention in the 1991 Gulf War.

====Iran====
In an interview on February 15, 2007, Pelosi said that Bush consistently said he supports a diplomatic resolution to differences with Iran &quot;and I take him at his word&quot;. At the same time, she said, &quot;I do believe that Congress should assert itself, though, and make it very clear that there is no previous authority for the president, any president, to go into Iran&quot;. On January 12, 2007, Congressman Walter B. Jones of North Carolina introduced a resolution requiring that—absent a national emergency created by an attack, or a demonstrably imminent attack, by Iran upon the United States or its armed forces—the president must consult with Congress and receive specific authorization prior to initiating any use of military force against Iran. This resolution was removed from a military spending bill for the war in Iraq by Pelosi on March 13, 2007.

In July 2015, Pelosi said she was convinced Obama would have enough votes to secure the Iran nuclear deal, crediting the president with having made a &quot;very strong and forceful presentation of his case supporting the nuclear agreement with Iran&quot; and called the deal &quot;a diplomatic masterpiece&quot;.

In 2016, Pelosi argued against two bills that if enacted would block Iran&#x27;s access to the dollar and impose sanctions for its ballistic missile program: &quot;Regardless of whether you supported the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), we all agree that Iran must not possess a nuclear weapon. At this time, the JCPOA is the best way to achieve this critical goal.&quot;

In May 2018, after Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, Pelosi said the decision was an abdication of American leadership and &quot;particularly senseless, disturbing &amp; dangerous&quot;.

====Iraq War====
In 2002, Pelosi opposed the Iraq Resolution authorizing President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq, which passed the House on a 296–133 vote. Pelosi said that &quot;unilateral use of force without first exhausting every diplomatic remedy and other remedies and making a case to the American people will be harmful to our war on terrorism.&quot; In explaining her opposition to the resolution, Pelosi said CIA Director George Tenet had told Congress the likelihood of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s launching an attack on the U.S. using weapons of mass destruction was low, saying: &quot;This is about the Constitution It is about this Congress asserting its right to declare war when we are fully aware what the challenges are to us. It is about respecting the United Nations and a multilateral approach, which is safer for our troops.&quot;

Although Pelosi voted against the Iraq War, anti-war activists in San Francisco protested against her voting to continue funding the war. UC Berkeley political scientist Bruce Cain said Pelosi had to balance the demands of her anti-war constituency against the moderate views of Democrats in tight races around the country in her role as minority leader. Pelosi has never faced a serious challenger to her left in her district.

====Israel====
Pelosi has reaffirmed that &quot;America and Israel share an unbreakable bond: in peace and war; and in prosperity and in hardship&quot;. She has emphasized that &quot;a strong relationship between the United States and Israel has long been supported by both Democrats and Republicans. America&#x27;s commitment to the safety and security of the State of Israel is unwavering... [h]owever, the war in Iraq has made both America and Israel less safe.&quot; Pelosi&#x27;s voting record shows consistent support for Israel. Pelosi voted in favor of the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, which urged the federal government to relocate the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Before the 2006 elections in the Palestinian Authority, she voted for a Congressional initiative that disapproved of participation in the elections by Hamas and other organizations the legislation defined as terrorist. She agrees with the current U.S. stance in support of land-for-peace. She has applauded Israeli &quot;hopeful signs&quot; of offering land while criticizing Palestinian &quot;threats&quot; of not demonstrating peace in turn. Pelosi has said, &quot;If the Palestinians agree to coordinate with Israel on the evacuation, establish the rule of law, and demonstrate a capacity to govern, the world may be convinced that finally there is a real partner for peace&quot;.

During the 2006 Lebanon War, Pelosi voted in favor of Resolution 921: &quot;...seizure of Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah terrorists was an unprovoked attack and Israel has the right, and indeed the obligation, to respond.&quot; She argues that organizations and political bodies in the Mideast like Hamas and Hezbollah &quot;have a greater interest in maintaining a state of hostility with Israel than in improving the lives of the people they claim to represent&quot;. Pelosi asserts that civilians on both sides of the border &quot;have been put at risk by the aggression of Hamas and Hezbollah&quot; in part for their use of &quot;civilians as shields by concealing weapons in civilian areas&quot;.

In September 2008, Pelosi hosted a reception in Washington with Israeli Speaker of the Knesset Dalia Itzik, along with 20 members of Congress, where they toasted the &quot;strong friendship&quot; between Israel and the United States. During the ceremony, Pelosi held up replica dog tags of the three Israeli soldiers captured by Hezbollah and Hamas in 2006 and said she keeps them as a &quot;symbol of the sacrifices made, sacrifices far too great by the people of the state of Israel&quot;.

Pelosi supported Israel in the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict. In March 2018 Pelosi said, &quot;There is no greater political accomplishment in the 20th Century than the establishment of the State of Israel.&quot; Pelosi condemned Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota for posting controversial tweets related to Jews and Israel. In March 2019, she said, &quot;Israel and America are connected now and forever. We will never allow anyone to make Israel a wedge issue.&quot;

In January 2017, Pelosi voted against a House resolution that would condemn the UN Security Council Resolution 2334. This UN Security Council Resolution called Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank a &quot;flagrant violation&quot; of international law and a major obstacle to peace. She condemned the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement targeting Israel.

Pelosi has voiced heavy criticism over Israel&#x27;s plan to annex parts of the West Bank and the Jordan Valley. She said Israeli annexation would undermine U.S. national security interests. Pelosi said that Democrats are taking &quot;a great pride&quot; in Barack Obama&#x27;s Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that Israel signed with the Obama administration in 2016, for a guarantee of $38billion in defense assistance over a decade.

On January 28, 2024, Pelosi suggested that some pro-Palestinian protesters calling for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war could be connected to Russia and called on the FBI to investigate the possible connection.

====North Korea====
Nancy Pelosi is one of the few members of Congress to have traveled to North Korea. She has expressed concern about the danger of nuclear proliferation from the North Korean regime, and the ongoing problems of hunger and oppression imposed by that country&#x27;s leadership.

In August 2017, following Trump&#x27;s warning that North Korea &quot;will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen&quot; in the event of further threats to the United States, Pelosi said the comments were &quot;recklessly belligerent and demonstrate a grave lack of appreciation for the severity of the North Korean nuclear situation. His saber-rattling and provocative, impulsive rhetoric erode our credibility.&quot;

In November 2017, after the Pentagon sent a letter to lawmakers stating a ground invasion was the only way to destroy all North Korea&#x27;s nuclear weapons without concern for having missed any, Pelosi said she was concerned about Pyongyang&#x27;s selling nuclear technology to third parties and called for the United States to &quot;exhaust every other remedy&quot;.

In June 2018, after Trump praised North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, Pelosi said in a statement, &quot;In his haste to reach an agreement, President Trump elevated North Korea to the level of the United States while preserving the regime&#x27;s status quo.&quot;

====Russia====
In December 2017, Pelosi wrote a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan advocating for the continued House investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election on the grounds that Americans deserved &quot;a comprehensive and fair investigation into Russia&#x27;s attack&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s democracy and national security&quot; being at stake. Pelosi cited the need for Congress to &quot;fully investigate Russia&#x27;s assault on our election systems to prevent future foreign attacks&quot;.

In February 2018, after the release of a Republican report alleging surveillance abuses by the Justice Department, Pelosi accused Trump of siding with Russian president Vladimir Putin at the expense of preserving intelligence sources and methods. In July, Pelosi asserted that Trump was afraid to mention the 12 indictments against people connected to the intelligence community in Russia during his meeting with Putin and questioned what intelligence the Russians had on Trump to cause his behavior. She said Putin would not be welcomed by Congress even if he visited Washington as a result of his actions: &quot;Putin&#x27;s ongoing attacks on our elections and on Western democracies and his illegal actions in Crimea and the rest of Ukraine deserve the fierce, unanimous condemnation of the international community, not a VIP ticket to our nation&#x27;s capital.&quot; She called for House Speaker Ryan to &quot;make clear that there is not—and never will be—an invitation for a thug like Putin to address the United States Congress.&quot;

On multiple occasions, Pelosi said of Trump, &quot;With him, all roads lead to Putin,&quot; including with regard to the Trump-Ukraine scandal, a lack of action against the alleged Russian bounty program, and Trump&#x27;s incitement of the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

====Syria, Libya, and Afghanistan====
Pelosi supports the Syria Accountability Act and Iran Freedom and Support Act. In a speech at the AIPAC 2005 annual conference, Pelosi said that &quot;for too long, leaders from both parties haven&#x27;t done enough&quot; to put pressure on Russia and China who are providing Iran with technological information on nuclear issues and missiles. &quot;If evidence of participation by other nations in Iran&#x27;s nuclear program is discovered, I will insist that the Administration use, rather than ignore, the evidence in determining how the U.S. deals with that nation or nations on other issues.&quot; In April 2007, Pelosi visited Syria, where she met Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, Vice President Farouk al-Sharaa and President Bashar al-Assad, despite President Bush efforts to isolate Syria, because of militants crossing from Syria into Iraq, and supporting Hezbollah and Hamas. During her visit, she conveyed Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert message for peace, and toured in Al-Hamidiyah Souq, and the Umayyad Mosque.

Pelosi supported the NATO-led military intervention in Libya in 2011. She also favored arming Syria&#x27;s rebel fighters.

In January 2019, Pelosi criticized President Trump&#x27;s planned withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan. She called Trump&#x27;s announcement a &quot;Christmas gift to Vladimir Putin&quot;. In an October 2019 letter to Democratic caucus members, Pelosi wrote that both parties were condemning President Trump&#x27;s deserting the US&#x27;s &quot;Kurdish allies in a foolish attempt to appease an authoritarian strongman&quot; Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey and opined that the decision &quot;poses a dire threat to regional security and stability, and sends a dangerous message to Iran and Russia, as well as our allies, that the United States is no longer a trusted partner&quot;. Later that month, she visited Jordan to discuss the Syrian situation with King Abdullah II. Afterwards, she went to Afghanistan, where she met President Ashraf Ghani and chief executive officer Abdullah Abdullah, and she was also briefed by U.S. diplomats on reconciliation efforts with the Taliban.

====Turkey====
In mid-October 2007, after the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a resolution to label the 1915 killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks as genocide, Pelosi pledged to bring the measure to a vote. The draft resolution prompted warnings from President Bush and fierce criticism from Turkey, with Turkey&#x27;s Prime Minister saying that approval of the resolution would endanger U.S.–Turkey relations. After House support eroded, the measure&#x27;s sponsors dropped their call for a vote, and in late October Pelosi agreed to set the matter aside.

The resolution was passed during Pelosi&#x27;s second term as Speaker. The House voted 405 to 11 in October 2019 to confirm the resolution.

====Ukraine====
On April 30, 2022, Pelosi met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv, to pledge U.S. support for Ukraine during the Russian invasion.

====Gaza====
After the drone strikes on aid workers from World Central Kitchen in April 2024, Pelosi, Mark Pocan, James P. McGovern, Jan Schakowsky, and 36 other Congressional Democrats urged President Biden in an open letter to reconsider planned arms shipments to the Israeli military.

== Public image ==
Pelosi has often been described as a polarizing figure, facing criticism from both the political right and left. Progressives have criticized her for her knowledge of waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques during the War on Terror, accusing her of not objecting strongly enough to these practices. Conservatives and libertarians have taken issue with her positions on gun rights, viewing her advocacy for gun control as an infringement on Second Amendment rights. They have also criticized her stance on taxation, particularly her support for higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations to fund social programs. Pelosi&#x27;s role in leading the House to impeach President Donald Trump twice has drawn significant criticism from Trump supporters and Republicans, who perceived the impeachments as politically motivated and divisive.

Pelosi has faced allegations of using her position for insider trading, particularly concerning stock transactions that critics claim were influenced by her legislative knowledge. Critics have also depicted her as a symbol of liberal elitism, pointing to her strong opposition to populism and comments suggesting that some Americans reject Democratic policies due to their beliefs about &quot;guns, gays, [and] God&quot;. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Pelosi was accused of hypocrisy when she had her hair styled at a salon that was supposed to be closed for indoor appointments due to health restrictions, with critics alleging she used her position to receive preferential treatment.

==Electoral history==


Pelosi&#x27;s only close race so far has been in the special election to succeed U.S. Representative Sala Burton after her death in February 1987. Pelosi defeated San Francisco Supervisor Harry Britt in the Democratic primary with 36 percent of the vote to his 32 percent, then Republican Harriet Ross by more than 2-to-1. Since then, Pelosi has enjoyed overwhelming support in her political career, collecting 76 and 77 percent of the vote in 1988 and 1990. In 1992, after the redistricting from the 1990 census, Pelosi ran in , which now covered the San Francisco area. She has continued to post landslide victories since, dropping beneath 80 percent of the vote only three times in general elections. After redistricting from the 2010 census, Pelosi ran in , which she represented for the next decade. Due to the 2020 United States redistricting cycle from the 2020 census, Pelosi now represents , which covers San Francisco.

==Personal life==

Nancy D&#x27;Alesandro met Paul Francis Pelosi while she was attending college. They married in Baltimore at the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen on September 7, 1963. They then moved to New York, followed by a move to San Francisco in 1969, where her husband&#x27;s brother Ronald Pelosi was a member of the City and County of San Francisco&#x27;s Board of Supervisors.

Nancy and Paul Pelosi have five children, including Christine and Alexandra, and nine grandchildren. Alexandra, a journalist, covered the Republican presidential campaigns in 2000 and made a film about the experience, &quot;Journeys with George&quot;. In 2007, Christine published a book, &quot;Campaign Boot Camp: Basic Training for Future Leaders&quot;.

Pelosi resides in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco. Her 2016 financial disclosure report lists among her assets a combined home and vineyard in St. Helena, California, two commercial buildings in San Francisco, and a townhouse in Loomis, California. In January 2021, her San Francisco home was vandalized with graffiti, messages of &quot;[c]ancel rent&quot; were left on her garage, along with fake blood and a severed pig&#x27;s head.

===Financial status===
Pelosi&#x27;s husband, Paul, is a wealthy investor and the primary source of the couple&#x27;s wealth. In 2009, OpenSecrets estimated Pelosi&#x27;s net worth at $58 million, making her the 13th-wealthiest member of Congress. In 2014, OpenSecrets reported Pelosi&#x27;s net worth had almost doubled, to about $101 million, making her the 8th-wealthiest. &quot;Business Insider&quot; reported that Pelosi&#x27;s net worth was $26.4million in 2012 and made her the 13th-richest member of Congress. In 2018, &quot;Roll Call&quot; estimated Pelosi&#x27;s net worth at $16.0million, making her the 30th-wealthiest member.

&quot;Roll Call&quot; said Pelosi&#x27;s earnings are connected to her husband&#x27;s heavy investments in stocks that include Apple, Disney, Comcast and Facebook. &quot;Roll Call&quot; reported that the couple have $13.46million in liabilities including mortgages on seven properties. According to &quot;Roll Call&quot;, Pelosi and her husband hold properties &quot;worth at least $23million, including a St. Helena vineyard in Napa Valley worth at least $5million.&quot;

As of 2021, Pelosi&#x27;s net worth was valued at $120 million, making her the 6th richest person in Congress. According to journalist Glenn Greenwald, the Pelosis have traded $33 million worth of tech stocks over the past two years, including Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, and Google stocks. In May and June 2021, Pelosi&#x27;s husband purchased stocks in tech companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple, netting a gain of $5.3 million. This occurred even while Speaker Pelosi was working on anti-trust legislation to better regulate the tech industry. The CEO of Apple, Tim Cook, had called Pelosi to lobby her in opposition to the new regulations. Pelosi opposes increasing regulations on stock trades by members of congress, stating that &quot;we&#x27;re a free market economy&quot; and congresspeople &quot;should be able to participate in that.&quot; This comment drew strong criticism, including from Democrats who favor banning stock trades by members of Congress.

===Involvement in Italian-American community===

Pelosi is a board member of the National Organization of Italian American Women. She served for 13 years as a board member of the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF). In 2007, she received the NIAF Special Achievement Award for Public Advocacy and remains involved in the foundation.

===Catholic church===

Pelosi considers herself a devout Catholic, but she has had numerous disagreements with members of the church hierarchy over gay rights, abortion, contraception, and in vitro fertilization. She has said that her biggest disappointment was the church&#x27;s lobbying against the Affordable Care Act because of contraception coverage.

Pelosi and Catholic bishops have also disagreed about abortion rights. Although she thought it was &quot;lovely&quot; that she had five children in a little over six years, she argued that &quot;It&#x27;s a woman&#x27;s right to make her own choices with her family, her God, her doctor.&quot;

On May 20, 2022, Salvatore Cordileone, archbishop of San Francisco, announced that Pelosi would be barred from receiving Holy Communion because of her support of pro-choice abortion policies. Cordileone had communicated his concerns on April 7, 2022, writing, &quot;should you not publicly repudiate your advocacy for abortion &#x27;rights&#x27; or else refrain from referring to your Catholic faith in public and receiving Holy Communion, I would have no choice but to make a declaration, in keeping with Canon 915, that you are not to be admitted to Holy Communion.&quot;

On June 29, 2022, Pelosi received Communion at a Papal Mass presided over by Pope Francis in Rome at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

===Home invasion===
In October 2022, while Pelosi was in Washington, D.C., an intruder entered her San Francisco home demanding to know her whereabouts, and attacked her husband, Paul Pelosi, with a hammer.. The assailant, David DePape, was convicted on federal and state charges and sentenced to life without parole.

===Health===
In December 2024, Pelosi was hospitalized after fracturing her hip while falling down stairs in high heels during an official trip to Luxembourg. She was there as part of a bipartisan congressional delegation to observe the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge. On December 14, she underwent hip replacement surgery at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, a U.S. military hospital in Germany.

<doc id="147307" wikidata="Q1579934" url="?curid=147307" title="Uniformed services of the United States">
<text>The United States has eight federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10 and subsequently structured and organized by Titles 10, 14, 32, 33, and 42 of the U.S. Code.

==Uniformed services==
The uniformed services are:
# Army
# Marine Corps
# Navy
# Air Force
# Space Force
# Coast Guard
# Public Health Service Commissioned Corps
# National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps

Each of the uniformed services is administratively headed by a federal executive department and its corresponding civilian Cabinet leader.

==Federal executive departments==
Department of the Army (DA)
* Army (USA): Established 14 June 1775
Department of the Navy (DON)
* Marine Corps (USMC): Established 10 November 1775
* Navy (USN): Established 13 October 1775
Department of the Air Force (DAF)
* Air Force (USAF): Established 18 September 1947
* Space Force (USSF): Established 20 December 2019

The order of precedence within the Department of Defense is set by DoD Directive 1005.8 and is not dependent on the date of creation by the U.S. Congress.

* Coast Guard (USCG): Established 4 August 1790
Prior to 1967, the Coast Guard was part of the Department of the Treasury. In 1967, it became a part of the Department of Transportation. In 2002, it was placed under the Department of Homeland Security. During times of war, it may be transferred to the Department of the Navy, under the Department of Defense.
* Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (PHSCC): Established 4 January 1889
The Corps is headed by the Surgeon General of the United States. The corps may be detailed to the armed forces by order of the president.
* National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps (NOAA Corps): Established 22 May 1917.
The NOAA Corps was created as the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps, a component of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, on 22 May 1917. It was removed from the Coast and Geodetic Survey and became a component of the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA) as the Environmental Science Services Administration Corps (ESSA Corps) upon the establishment of ESSA on 13 July 1965. The ESSA Corps became the NOAA Corps as a component of NOAA when ESSA was abolished and NOAA simultaneously was created on 3 October 1970. Under all three names, the corps has been an element of the Department of Commerce throughout its existence. The corps may be detailed to the armed forces by order of the president.

==Statutory definition==
The eight uniformed services are defined by :

&lt;poem&gt;The term &quot;uniformed services&quot; means—
:(A) the armed forces;
:(B) the commissioned corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and
:(C) the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The six uniformed services that make up the armed forces of the United States are defined in the previous clause, :

The term &quot;armed forces&quot; means the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Space Force, and Coast Guard.

All eight uniformed services are subject to the provisions of , the Uniformed Services Former Spouses&#x27; Protection Act.

==U.S. Armed Forces==

Six of the uniformed services make up the armed forces as defined by Title 10, five of which are within the Department of Defense. The Coast Guard is part of the Department of Homeland Security and has both military and law enforcement duties. Title 14 states that the Coast Guard is part of the armed forces at all times, making it the only branch of the military outside the Department of Defense. During a declared state of war, however, the President of the United States or U.S. Congress may direct that the Coast Guard operate as part of the Department of the Navy. The Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, along with the NOAA Commissioned Corps, operate under military rules with the exception of the applicability of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to which they are subject only when militarized by executive order or while detailed to any component of the armed forces.

Reserve components of the United States Armed Forces are all members of the military who serve in a reserve capacity. The National Guard is an additional reserve military component of the Army and Air Force, respectively, and is composed of National Guard units, which operate under Title 32 and under state authority as the Army National Guard and Air National Guard. The militia that later became the National Guard was first formed in the Colony of Virginia in 1607 and is the oldest uniformed military force founded in the New World. The National Guard can also be mobilized by the president to operate under federal authority through Title 10. When acting under federal direction, the National Guard is managed by the National Guard Bureau, which is a joint Army and Air Force activity under the Department of Defense, with a 4-star general from the Army or Air Force appointed as its top leader. However, in federal service, command and control of National Guard organizations will fall under the designated geographic or functional combatant commander. The National Guard serves as a reserve component for both the Army and the Air Force, and can be called up for federal active duty in times of war or national emergencies.

==Non-armed uniformed services==
*The Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (PHSCC) is the uniformed personnel system of the Public Health Service, which is under the Department of Health and Human Services.
* The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps (NOAA Corps) is a uniformed branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which is under the Department of Commerce.

Commissioned officers of the PHSCC and NOAA Corps wear uniforms that are derived from U.S. Navy and Coast Guard uniforms, except that the commissioning devices, buttons, and insignia reflect their specific service. Uniformed officers of the PHSCC and NOAA Corps are paid on the same scale as members of the armed services, with respective rank and time-in-grade. Additionally, PHSCC officers are covered by the Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Rights Act and the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (formerly the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act). The PHSCC and NOAA Corps consist of commissioned officers only and have no warrant officer ranks or enlisted ranks.

Commissioned officers of the PHSCC and NOAA Corps may be militarized by order of the president. Because they are commissioned officers, they can be classified as prisoners of war (POW) under the Geneva Conventions if captured by a belligerent entity. The PHSCC traces its origins to a system of marine hospitals created by An Act for the relief of sick and disabled seamen, passed by Congress in 1798; it adopted a military model of organization in 1871. The Coast and Geodetic Survey (USC&amp;GS), a predecessor to NOAA, originally began commissioning its officers so that if captured while engaged in battlefield surveying, they would be protected under the law of armed conflict and could not be tried or executed as spies. The USC&amp;GS Commissioned Officer Corps became the Environmental Science Services Administration Corps (ESSA Corps), upon the creation of the Environmental Science Services Administration on 13 July 1965, then became the NOAA Corps upon the creation of NOAA on 3 October 1970.

== U.S. Merchant Marine Service ==
The United States Maritime Service is federal uniformed organization within the Department of Transportation, that is no longer structurally organized. As such, they are not officially listed a federal uniformed service, as defined by U.S. law. However under the authority of the president and the secretary of transportation, the service still commissions officers to serve as administrators and instructors at the United States Merchant Marine Academy and the state maritime academies. Commissioned officers of the Maritime Service cannot be deployed or assigned to another military service, and thus are not subjected to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. While the chances a Maritime Service officer being captured by an enemy is virtually impossible, they would be classified as POWs under the Geneva Conventions if they were.

<doc id="147308" wikidata="Q144669" url="?curid=147308" title="Ruth Brown">
<text>Ruth Alston Brown (; January 12, 1928 – November 17, 2006) was an American singer-songwriter and actress, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Queen of R&amp;B&quot;. She was noted for bringing a pop music style to R&amp;B music in a series of hit songs for Atlantic Records in the 1950s, such as &quot;So Long&quot;, &quot;Teardrops from My Eyes&quot; and &quot;(Mama) He Treats Your Daughter Mean&quot;. For these contributions, Atlantic became known as &quot;the house that Ruth built&quot; (alluding to the popular nickname for the old Yankee Stadium). Brown was a 1993 inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Following a resurgence that began in the mid-1970s and peaked in the 1980s, Brown used her influence to press for musicians&#x27; rights regarding royalties and contracts; these efforts led to the founding of the Rhythm and Blues Foundation. Her performances in the Broadway musical &quot;Black and Blue&quot; earned Brown a Tony Award, and the original cast recording won a Grammy Award. Brown was a recipient of the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2016. In 2017, Brown was inducted into National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Brown at number 146 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

Brown is the aunt of rapper Rakim.

==Early life==
Born in Portsmouth, Virginia, Brown was the eldest of seven siblings. She attended I. C. Norcom High School. Brown&#x27;s father was a dockhand. He also directed the local church choir at Emmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, but the young Ruth showed more interest in singing at USO shows and nightclubs, rebelling against her father. She was inspired by Sarah Vaughan, Billie Holiday, and Dinah Washington.

In 1945, aged 17, Brown ran away from her home in Portsmouth along with the trumpeter Jimmy Brown, whom she soon married, to sing in bars and clubs. She then spent a month with Lucky Millinder&#x27;s orchestra.

==Early career==

Blanche Calloway, Cab Calloway&#x27;s sister, also a bandleader, arranged a gig for Brown at the Crystal Caverns, a nightclub in Washington, D.C., and soon became her manager. Willis Conover, the future Voice of America disc jockey, caught her act with Duke Ellington and recommended her to Atlantic Records bosses Ahmet Ertegun and Herb Abramson. Brown was unable to audition as planned because of a car crash, which resulted in a nine-month stay in the hospital. She signed with Atlantic Records from her hospital bed.

In 1948, Ertegun and Abramson drove from New York City to Washington, D.C., to hear Brown sing. Her repertoire was mostly popular ballads, but Ertegun convinced her to switch to rhythm and blues.

In her first audition, in 1949, she sang &quot;So Long,&quot; which became a hit. This was followed by &quot;Teardrops from My Eyes&quot; in 1950. Written by Rudy Toombs, it was the first upbeat major hit for Brown. Recorded for Atlantic Records in New York City in September 1950 and released in October, it was &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s R&amp;B number one for 11 weeks. The hit earned her the nickname &quot;Miss Rhythm&quot;, and within a few months, she became the acknowledged queen of R&amp;B.

She followed up this hit with &quot;I&#x27;ll Wait for You&quot; (1951), &quot;I Know&quot; (1951), &quot;5-10-15 Hours&quot; (1953), &quot;(Mama) He Treats Your Daughter Mean&quot; (1953), &quot;Oh What a Dream&quot; (1954), &quot;Mambo Baby&quot; (1954), and &quot;Don&#x27;t Deceive Me&quot; (1960), some of which were credited to Ruth Brown and the Rhythm Makers. Between 1949 and 1955, her records stayed on the R&amp;B chart for a total of 149 weeks; she would go on to score 21 Top 10 hits all together, including five that landed at number one. Brown ranked No. 1 on The &quot;Billboard&quot; 1954 Disk Jockey Poll for Favorite R&amp;B Artists.

Brown played many racially segregated dances in the southern states, where she toured extensively and was immensely popular. She claimed that a writer had once summed up her popularity by saying, &quot;In the South, Ruth Brown is better known than Coca-Cola.&quot;

Brown performed at the famed tenth Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles, which was produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. on June 20, 1954. She performed along with The Flairs, Count Basie and his Orchestra, Lamp Lighters, Louis Jordan and His Tympany Five, Christine Kittrell, and Perez Prado and his Orchestra.

Her first pop hit came with &quot;Lucky Lips&quot;, a song written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller and recorded in 1957. The single reached number 6 on the R&amp;B chart and number 25 on the U.S. pop chart. The 1958 follow-up was &quot;This Little Girl&#x27;s Gone Rockin&#x27;&quot;, written by Bobby Darin and Mann Curtis. It reached number 7 on the R&amp;B chart and number 24 on the pop chart.

She had further hits with &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know&quot; in 1959 and &quot;Don&#x27;t Deceive Me&quot; in 1960, which were more successful on the R&amp;B chart than on the pop chart. In 1965 she appeared as a guest on TV Gospel Time. During the 1960s, Brown faded from public view and lived as a housewife and mother.

==Later career==

She returned to music in 1975 at the urging of the comedian Redd Foxx, followed by a series of comedic acting jobs. This launched her career in TV, film, and stage. She had a recurring role during the second season of the sitcom &quot;Hello, Larry&quot; as the neighbor, Leona Wilson. She starred as Motormouth Maybelle Stubbs, a friendly and strong-willed record promoter and mother of Seaweed and L&#x27;il Inez, in the John Waters cult classic film &quot;Hairspray&quot;. On Broadway, she starred in productions of &quot;Amen Corner&quot; and &quot;Black and Blue&quot;. The latter earned her a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical in 1989. &quot;The New York Times&quot; theater critic Frank Rich wrote, &quot;Ruth Brown, the rhythm-and-blues chanteuse, applies sarcastic varnish and two-a-day burlesque timing to the ribald Andy Razaf lyrics of &#x27;If I Can&#x27;t Sell It, I&#x27;ll Keep Sittin&#x27; on It.&#x27;&quot;

Brown&#x27;s fight for musicians&#x27; rights and royalties in 1987 led to the founding of the Rhythm and Blues Foundation in 1988. She was one of the first recipients of the Pioneer Award in 1989. In 1989, she released an album, &quot;Blues and Broadway,&quot; which won a Grammy for best jazz vocal performance, female. She was inducted into the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame in 1992 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.

Brown recorded and sang with the rhythm-and-blues singer Charles Brown. She also toured with Bonnie Raitt in the late 1990s. Her 1995 autobiography, &quot;Miss Rhythm&quot;, won the Gleason Award for music journalism. She also appeared on Bonnie Raitt&#x27;s 1995 live DVD &quot;Road Tested&quot;, singing &quot;Never Make Your Move Too Soon&quot;. She was nominated for another Grammy in the Traditional Blues category for her 1997 album, &quot;R + B = Ruth Brown&quot;. In the 2000 television miniseries &quot;Little Richard&quot;, she was portrayed by singer Tressa Thomas.

She hosted the radio program &quot;Blues Stage&quot;, carried by more than 200 NPR affiliates, for six years, starting in 1989.

Brown was still touring at the age of 78. She had completed preproduction work on the Danny Glover film, &quot;Honeydripper&quot;, which she did not live to finish. Still, her recording of &quot;Things About Comin&#x27; My Way&quot; was released posthumously on the soundtrack CD. Her last interview was in August 2006.

==Death==
Brown died in a Las Vegas–area hospital on November 17, 2006, from complications following a heart attack and stroke she suffered after surgery in the previous month. She was 78 years old. A memorial concert for her was held on January 22, 2007, at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, New York.

Brown is buried at Roosevelt Memorial Park, Chesapeake City, Virginia.

<text>Ray Charles Robinson (September 23, 1930 – June 10, 2004) was an American singer, songwriter, and pianist. He is regarded as one of the most iconic and influential musicians in history, and was often referred to by contemporaries as &quot;The Genius&quot;. Among friends and fellow musicians, he preferred being called &quot;Brother Ray&quot;. Charles was blinded during childhood, possibly due to glaucoma.

Charles pioneered the soul music genre during the 1950s by combining elements of blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, and gospel into his music during his time with Atlantic Records. He contributed to the integration of country music, rhythm and blues, and pop music during the 1960s with his crossover success on ABC Records, notably with his two &quot;Modern Sounds&quot; albums. While he was with ABC, Charles became one of the first black musicians to be granted artistic control by a mainstream record company.

Charles&#x27; 1960 hit &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; was the first of his three career No. 1 hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. His 1962 album &quot;Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music&quot; became his first album to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Charles had multiple singles reach the Top 40 on various &quot;Billboard&quot; charts: 44 on the US R&amp;B singles chart, 11 on the Hot 100 singles chart, and two on the Hot Country singles charts.

Charles cited Nat King Cole as a primary influence, but his music was also influenced by Art Tatum, Louis Jordan and Charles Brown. He had a lifelong friendship and occasional partnership with Quincy Jones. Frank Sinatra called Ray Charles &quot;the only true genius in show business&quot;, although Charles downplayed this notion. Billy Joel said, &quot;This may sound like sacrilege, but I think Ray Charles was more important than Elvis Presley.&quot;

For his musical contributions, Charles received the Kennedy Center Honors, the National Medal of Arts, and the Polar Music Prize. He was one of the inaugural inductees at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986. He has won 18 Grammy Awards (five posthumously), the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1987, and 10 of his recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Charles No. 10 on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;, and No. 2 on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;. In 2022, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, as well as the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame.

==Early life and education==
Charles was born on September 23, 1930, in Albany, Georgia. He was the son of Bailey Robinson, a laborer, and Aretha (or Reatha) Robinson (née Williams), a laundress, of Greenville, Florida.

During Aretha&#x27;s childhood, her mother died. Her father could not keep her. Bailey, a man her father worked with, took her in. The Robinson family—Bailey, his wife Mary Jane, and his mother— informally adopted her and Aretha took the surname Robinson. A few years later Aretha became pregnant by Bailey. During the ensuing scandal, she left Greenville late in the summer of 1930 to be with family back in Albany. After the birth of the child, Ray Charles, she and the infant Charles returned to Greenville. Aretha and Bailey&#x27;s wife, who had lost a son, then shared in Charles&#x27; upbringing. The father had left Greenville and married another woman elsewhere. By his first birthday, Charles had a brother, George.

Charles was deeply devoted to his mother and later recalled, despite her poor health and adversity, her perseverance, self-sufficiency, and pride as guiding lights in his life.

In his early years, Charles showed an interest in mechanical objects and often watched his neighbors working on their cars and farm machinery. His musical curiosity was sparked at Wylie Pitman&#x27;s Red Wing Cafe, at the age of three, when Pitman played boogie woogie on an old upright piano; Pitman subsequently taught Charles how to play the piano. Charles and his mother were always welcome at the Red Wing Cafe and even lived there when they were in financial distress. Pitman also cared for Ray&#x27;s younger brother George, to take some of the burden off their mother. George accidentally drowned in his mother&#x27;s laundry tub when he was four years old.

Charles started to lose his sight at the age of four or five, and was blind by the age of seven, likely as a result of glaucoma. Because of his blindness, Charles donned his famous sunglasses. Destitute, uneducated, and mourning the loss of her younger son, Aretha Robinson used her connections in the local community to find a school that would accept a blind African-American pupil. Despite his initial protest, Charles attended school at the Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind in St. Augustine from 1937 to 1945 and learned to play a variety of instruments including the piano, alto saxophone, clarinet, trumpet, and organ. He focused primarily on the piano.

Charles further developed his musical talent at school, taking classical piano lessons and learning the music of composers such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, and Sibelius. His music teacher, Mrs. Lawrence, taught him to read and write music using Braille, a difficult process that requires learning the left hand movements by reading braille with the right hand and learning the right hand movements by reading braille with the left hand, then combining the two parts.

Charles&#x27; mother died in the spring of 1945, when he was 14. Her death came as a shock to him; he later said the deaths of his brother and mother were &quot;the two great tragedies&quot; of his life. Charles decided not to return to school after the funeral.

==Career==
===1945–1952: Florida, Los Angeles, and Seattle===
After leaving school, Charles moved to Jacksonville to live with Charles Wayne Powell, who had been friends with his late mother. He played the piano for bands at the Ritz Theatre in LaVilla for over a year, earning $4 a night (US$, in value). He joined Local 632 of the American Federation of Musicians, in the hope that it would help him get work, and was able to use the union hall&#x27;s piano to practice, since he did not have one at home; he learned piano licks from copying the other players there. He started to build a reputation as a talented musician in Jacksonville, but the jobs did not come fast enough for him to construct a strong identity, so, at age 16, he moved to Orlando, where he lived in borderline poverty and went without food for days. Charles eventually started to write arrangements for a pop music band, and in the summer of 1947, he unsuccessfully auditioned to play piano for Lucky Millinder and his sixteen-piece band.

In 1947, Charles moved to Tampa, where he held two jobs, including one as a pianist for Charles Brantley&#x27;s Honey Dippers.

In his early career, Charles modeled himself on Nat King Cole. His first four recordings—&quot;Wondering and Wondering&quot;, &quot;Walking and Talking&quot;, &quot;Why Did You Go?&quot; and &quot;I Found My Baby There&quot;—were allegedly done in Tampa, although some discographies claim he recorded them in Miami in 1951 or else Los Angeles in 1952.

Charles had always played piano for other people, but he was keen to have his own band. He decided to leave Florida for a large city, and, considering Chicago and New York City too big, followed his friend Gossie McKee to Seattle, Washington, in March 1948, knowing that the biggest radio hits came from northern cities. There he met and befriended, under the tutelage of Robert Blackwell, the 15-year-old Quincy Jones.

With Charles on piano, McKee on guitar, and Milton Garred on bass, &quot;The McSon Trio&quot; (named for McKee and Robinson) started playing the 1–5 A.M. shift at the Rocking Chair. Publicity photos of this trio are some of the earliest known photographs of Charles. In April 1949, he and his band recorded &quot;Confession Blues&quot;, which became his first national hit, soaring to the second spot on the Billboard R&amp;B chart. While still working at the Rocking Chair, Charles also arranged songs for other artists, including Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Ghost of a Chance&quot; and Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s &quot;Emanon&quot;. After the success of his first two singles, Charles moved to Los Angeles in 1950 and spent the next few years touring with the blues musician Lowell Fulson as Fulson&#x27;s musical director.

In 1950, Charles&#x27; performance in a Miami hotel impressed Henry Stone, who went on to record a Ray Charles Rockin&#x27; record, which did not achieve popularity. During his stay in Miami, Charles was required to stay in the segregated but thriving black community of Overtown. Stone later helped Jerry Wexler find Charles in St. Petersburg.

After signing with Swing Time Records, Charles recorded two more R&amp;B hits under the name Ray Charles: &quot;Baby, Let Me Hold Your Hand&quot; (1951), which reached No. 5, and &quot;Kissa Me Baby&quot; (1952), which reached No. 8. Swing Time folded the following year, and Ahmet Ertegun signed Charles to Atlantic.

In addition to being a musician, Charles was also a record producer, producing Guitar Slim&#x27;s number 1 hit, &quot;The Things That I Used to Do&quot;.

===1952–1959: Atlantic Records===

In June 1952, Atlantic bought Charles&#x27; contract for $2,500 (US$ in dollars). His first recording session for Atlantic (&quot;The Midnight Hour&quot;/&quot;Roll with My Baby&quot;) took place in September 1952, although his last Swing Time release (&quot;Misery in My Heart&quot;/&quot;The Snow Is Falling&quot;) would not appear until February 1953.

In 1953, &quot;Mess Around&quot; became his first small hit for Atlantic; during the next year, he had hits with &quot;It Should&#x27;ve Been Me&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t You Know&quot;. He also recorded the songs &quot;Midnight Hour&quot; and &quot;Sinner&#x27;s Prayer&quot; around this time.

Late in 1954, Charles recorded &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Woman&quot;. The lyrics were written by bandleader Renald Richard. Charles claimed the composition. They later admitted that the song went back to the Southern Tones&#x27; &quot;It Must Be Jesus&quot; (1954). It became one of his most notable hits, reaching No. 2 on the R&amp;B chart. &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Woman&quot; combined gospel, jazz, and blues elements. In 1955, he had hits with &quot;This Little Girl of Mine&quot; and &quot;A Fool for You&quot;. In upcoming years, hits included &quot;Drown in My Own Tears&quot; and &quot;Hallelujah I Love Her So&quot;.

Charles also recorded jazz, such as &quot;The Great Ray Charles&quot; (1957). He worked with vibraphonist Milt Jackson, releasing &quot;Soul Brothers&quot; in 1958 and &quot;Soul Meeting&quot; in 1961. By 1958, he was not only headlining major black venues such as the Apollo Theater in New York, but also larger venues such as Carnegie Hall and the Newport Jazz Festival, where his first live album was recorded in 1958. He hired a female singing group, the Cookies, and renamed them the Raelettes. In 1958, Charles and the Raelettes performed for the famed Cavalcade of Jazz concert produced by Leon Hefflin Sr. held at the Shrine Auditorium on August 3. The other headliners were Little Willie John, Sam Cooke, Ernie Freeman, and Bo Rhambo. Sammy Davis Jr. was also there to crown the winner of the Miss Cavalcade of Jazz beauty contest. The event featured the top four prominent disc jockeys of Los Angeles.

Charles reached the pinnacle of his success at Atlantic with the release of &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot;, which combined gospel, jazz, blues and Latin music. Charles said he wrote it spontaneously while he was performing in clubs with his band. Despite some radio stations banning the song because of its sexually suggestive lyrics, the song became Charles&#x27; first top-ten pop record. It reached No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop chart and No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart in 1959. Later that year, he released his first country song (a cover of Hank Snow&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Movin&#x27; On&quot;) and recorded three more albums for the label: a jazz record (&quot;The Genius After Hours&quot;, 1961); a blues record (&quot;The Genius Sings the Blues&quot;, 1961); and a big band record (&quot;The Genius of Ray Charles&quot;, 1959) which was his first Top 40 album, peaking at No. 17.

===1959–1971: Crossover success===

Charles&#x27; contract with Atlantic expired in 1959, and several big labels offered him record deals. Choosing not to renegotiate his contract with Atlantic, he signed with ABC-Paramount in November 1959. He obtained a more liberal contract than other artists had at the time, with ABC offering him a $50,000 (US$ in dollars) annual advance, higher royalties than before, and eventual ownership of his master tapes—a very valuable and lucrative deal at the time. During his Atlantic years, Charles had been hailed for his inventive compositions, but by the time of the release of the largely instrumental jazz album &quot;Genius + Soul = Jazz&quot; (1960) for ABC&#x27;s subsidiary label Impulse!, he had given up on writing in favor of becoming a cover artist, giving his own eclectic arrangements of existing songs.

With &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot;, his first hit single for ABC-Paramount in 1960, Charles received national acclaim and four Grammy Awards, including two for &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; (Best Vocal Performance Single Record or Track, Male, and Best Performance by a Pop Single Artist). Written by Stuart Gorrell and Hoagy Carmichael in 1930, the song was Charles&#x27; first work with Sid Feller, who produced, arranged and conducted the recording. Charles&#x27; rendition of the tune helped elevate it to the status of an American classic, and his version also became the state song of Georgia in 1979.

Charles earned another Grammy for the follow-up track &quot;Hit the Road Jack&quot;, written by R&amp;B singer Percy Mayfield.

In 1961, Charles had expanded his small road ensemble to a big band, partly as a response to increasing royalties and touring fees, becoming one of the few black artists to cross over into mainstream pop with such a level of creative control. Concerts in Antibes and later Zurich, Lyon and Paris led to Charles becoming the #1 bestselling jazz artist in France for many years. This success, however, came to a momentary halt during a concert tour in November 1961, when a police search of Charles&#x27; hotel room in Indianapolis, Indiana, led to the discovery of heroin in the medicine cabinet. The case was eventually dropped, as the search lacked a proper warrant by the police, and Charles soon returned to music. 

In the early 1960s, on the way from Louisiana to Oklahoma City, Charles faced a near-death experience when the pilot of his plane lost visibility, as snow and his failure to use the defroster caused the windshield of the plane to become completely covered in ice. The pilot made a few circles in the air before he was finally able to see through a small part of the windshield and land the plane. Charles placed a spiritual interpretation on the experience, claiming that &quot;something or someone which instruments cannot detect&quot; was responsible for creating the small opening in the ice on the windshield which enabled the pilot to eventually land the plane safely.

The 1962 album &quot;Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, Vol. 2&quot;, helped to bring country music into the musical mainstream. Charles&#x27; version of the Don Gibson song &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot; topped the Pop chart for five weeks, stayed at No. 1 on the R&amp;B chart for ten weeks, and gave him his only number-one record in the UK. In 1962, he founded his record label, Tangerine, which ABC-Paramount promoted and distributed. He had major pop hits in 1963 with &quot;Busted&quot; (US No. 4) and &quot;Take These Chains from My Heart&quot; (US No. 8). In 1964, Margie Hendrix was kicked out of the Raelettes after a big argument.

In 1964, Charles&#x27; career was halted once more after he was arrested for a third time for possession of heroin. He agreed to go to a rehabilitative facility to avoid jail time and eventually kicked his habit at a clinic in Los Angeles. After spending a year on parole, Charles reappeared in the charts in 1966 with a series of hits composed with Ashford &amp; Simpson and Jo Armstead, including the dance number &quot;I Don&#x27;t Need No Doctor&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Get Stoned&quot;, which became his first number-one R&amp;B hit in several years. His cover version of &quot;Crying Time&quot;, originally recorded by country singer Buck Owens, reached No. 6 on the pop chart and helped Charles win a Grammy Award the following March. In 1967, he had a top-twenty hit with another ballad, &quot;Here We Go Again&quot;.

===1971–1983: Commercial decline===
Charles&#x27; renewed chart success, however, proved to be short lived, and by the 1970s his music was rarely played on radio stations. The rise of psychedelic rock and harder forms of rock and R&amp;B music had reduced Charles&#x27; radio appeal, as did his choosing to record pop standards and covers of contemporary rock and soul hits, since his earnings from owning his master tapes had taken away the motivation to write new material. Charles nonetheless continued to have an active recording career. Most of his recordings between 1968 and 1973 evoked strong reactions: either adored or panned by fans and critics alike. His recordings during this period, especially 1972&#x27;s &quot;A Message from the People&quot;, moved toward the progressive soul sound popular at the time. &quot;A Message from the People&quot; included his unique gospel-influenced version of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; and a number of protest songs about poverty and civil rights. Charles was often criticized for his version of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; because it was very drastically changed from the song&#x27;s original version. On July 14, 1973, Margie Hendrix, the mother of Ray&#x27;s son Charles Wayne Hendrix, died at 38 years old, which led to Ray having to care for the child. The official cause of her death is unknown.

In 1974, Charles left ABC Records and recorded several albums on his own label, Crossover Records. A 1975 recording of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s hit &quot;Living for the City&quot; later helped Charles win another Grammy. In 1977, he reunited with Ahmet Ertegun and re-signed to Atlantic Records, for which he recorded the album &quot;True to Life&quot;, remaining with his old label until 1980. However, the label had now begun to focus on rock acts, and some of their prominent soul artists, such as Aretha Franklin, were starting to be neglected. In November 1977 he appeared as the host of the NBC television show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

In April 1979, his version of &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; was proclaimed the state song of Georgia, and an emotional Charles performed the song on the floor of the state legislature. In 1980 Charles performed in the musical film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;. Although he had notably supported the American Civil Rights Movement and Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s, Charles was criticized for performing at the Sun City resort in South Africa in 1981 during an international boycott protesting that country&#x27;s apartheid policy. He later defended his choice of performing there, insisting that the audience of black and white fans would integrate while he was there.

===1983–2004: Later years===
In 1983, Charles signed a contract with Columbia. He recorded a string of country albums and had hit singles in duets with singers such as George Jones, Chet Atkins, B. J. Thomas, Mickey Gilley, Hank Williams Jr., Dee Dee Bridgewater (&quot;Precious Thing&quot;) and his longtime friend Willie Nelson, with whom he recorded &quot;Seven Spanish Angels&quot;.

In 1985, Charles participated in the musical recording and video &quot;We Are the World&quot;, a charity single recorded by the supergroup United Support of Artists (USA) for Africa.

In 1990 he participated for the first time in the Sanremo Music Festival with song &quot;Good Love Gone Bad&quot;, written by Toto Cutugno.

Before the release of his first album for Warner, &quot;Would You Believe&quot;, Charles made a return to the R&amp;B charts with a cover of the Brothers Johnson&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Good to You&quot;, a duet with his lifelong friend Quincy Jones and the singer Chaka Khan, which hit number one on the R&amp;B chart in 1990 and won Charles and Khan a Grammy for their duet. Prior to this, Charles returned to the pop charts with &quot;Baby Grand&quot;, a duet with singer-songwriter Billy Joel. In 1989, he recorded a cover of the Southern All Stars&#x27; &quot;Itoshi no Ellie&quot; for a Japanese TV advertisement for the Suntory brand, releasing it in Japan as &quot;Ellie My Love&quot;, where it reached No.3 on its Oricon chart. In the same year he was a special guest at the Verona Arena during the tour promoting &quot;Oro Incenso &amp; Birra&quot; of the Italian singer Zucchero Fornaciari.

In 2001–02, Charles appeared in commercials for the New Jersey Lottery to promote its campaign &quot;For every dream, there&#x27;s a jackpot.&quot;

In 2003, he headlined the White House Correspondents&#x27; Association Dinner in Washington, D.C., attended by President George W. Bush, Laura Bush, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice.

Also in 2003, Charles presented Van Morrison with Morrison&#x27;s award upon being inducted in the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the two sang Morrison&#x27;s song &quot;Crazy Love&quot; (the performance appears on Morrison&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;The Best of Van Morrison Volume 3&quot;). In 2003, Charles performed &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; and &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; at a televised annual banquet of electronic media journalists held in Washington, D.C. His final public appearance was on April 30, 2004, at the dedication of his music studio as a historic landmark in Los Angeles.

==Legacy==
===Influence on music industry===
Charles possessed one of the most recognizable voices in American music. In the words of musicologist Henry Pleasants:

Pleasants continues, &quot;Ray Charles is usually described as a baritone, and his speaking voice would suggest as much, as would the difficulty he experiences in reaching and sustaining the baritone&#x27;s high E and F in a popular ballad. But the voice undergoes some sort of transfiguration under stress, and in music of gospel or blues character he can and does sing for measures on end in the high tenor range of A, B flat, B, C and even C sharp and D, sometimes in full voice, sometimes in an ecstatic head voice, sometimes in falsetto. In falsetto he continues up to E and F above high C. On one extraordinary record, &#x27;I&#x27;m Going Down to the River&#x27;...he hits an incredible B flat...giving him an overall range, including the falsetto extension, of at least three octaves.&quot;

His style and success in the genres of rhythm and blues and jazz had an influence on a number of highly successful artists, including, as Jon Pareles has noted, Elvis Presley, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Van Morrison, and Billy Joel. Other singers who have acknowledged Charles&#x27; influence on their own styles include James Booker, Steve Winwood, Richard Manuel, and Gregg Allman. According to Joe Levy, a music editor for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;The hit records he made for Atlantic in the mid-1950s mapped out everything that would happen to rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and soul music in the years that followed.&quot; Charles was also an inspiration to Pink Floyd member Roger Waters, who told the Turkish newspaper &quot;Hürriyet&quot;: &quot;I was about 15. In the middle of the night with friends, we were listening to jazz. It was &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot;, Ray Charles&#x27; version. Then I thought &#x27;One day, if I make some people feel only one-twentieth of what I am feeling now, it will be quite enough for me.

&quot;Ray&quot;, a biopic portraying his life and career between the mid-1930s and 1979, was released in October 2004, starring Jamie Foxx as Charles. Foxx won the 2005 Academy Award for Best Actor for the role.

===Contribution to civil rights movement===
On March 15, 1961, shortly after the release of the hit song &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; (1960), the Albany, Georgia-born musician was scheduled to perform at a dance at Bell Auditorium in Augusta, but cancelled the show after learning from students of Paine College that the larger auditorium dance floor was restricted to whites, while blacks would be obliged to sit in the Music Hall balcony. Charles left town immediately after letting the public know why he would not be performing, but the promoter went on to sue Charles for breach of contract, and Charles was fined $757 in Fulton County Superior Court in Atlanta on June 14, 1962. The following year, Charles did perform at a desegregated Bell Auditorium concert together with his backup singers, the Raelettes, on October 23, 1963, as depicted in the 2004 film, &quot;Ray&quot;. On December 7, 2007, Ray Charles Plaza was opened in Albany, Georgia, with a revolving, lighted bronze sculpture of Charles seated at a piano.

===The Ray Charles Foundation===
Founded in 1986, the Ray Charles Foundation maintains the mission statement of financially supporting institutions and organizations in the research of hearing disorders. Originally known as The Robinson Foundation for Hearing Disorders, it was renamed in 2006 and has provided financial donations to numerous institutions involved in hearing loss research and education. The purpose of the foundation has been &quot;to administer funds for scientific, educational and charitable purposes; to encourage, promote and educate, through grants to institutions and organizations, as to the causes and cures for diseases and disabilities of the hearing impaired and to assist organizations and institutions in their social educational and academic advancement of programs for the youth, and carry on other charitable and educational activities associated with these goals as allowed by law.&quot;

Recipients of donations include Benedict College, Morehouse College, and other universities. The foundation has taken action against donation recipients who do not use funds in accordance with its mission statement, such as the Albany State University, which was made to return a $3 million donation after not using the funds for over a decade. The foundation houses its executive offices at the historic RPM International Building, originally the home of Ray Charles Enterprises and now also home to the Ray Charles Memorial Library on the first floor, which was founded on September 23, 2010 (what would have been his 80th birthday). The library was founded to &quot;provide an avenue for young children to experience music and art in a way that will inspire their creativity and imagination&quot;, and is not open to the public without reservation, as the main goal is to educate mass groups of underprivileged youth and provide art and history to those without access to such documents.

==Personal life==
Charles stated in his 1978 autobiography, &quot;Brother Ray: Ray Charles&#x27; Own Story&quot;, that he became hooked on women after losing his virginity at 12 years old to a woman about 20. &quot;Cigarettes and smack [heroin] are the two truly addictive habits I&#x27;ve known. You might add women,&quot; he said. &quot;My obsession centers on women—did then [when young] and does now. I can&#x27;t leave them alone,&quot; he added.

===Relationships and children===
Charles was married twice. His first marriage lasted less than a year, his second 22 years. Throughout his life, Charles had many relationships with women, and he fathered a dozen children.

Charles was married to his first wife, Eileen Williams, from July 31, 1951 until sometime in 1952.

He met his second wife, Della Beatrice Howard Robinson (called &quot;Bea&quot; by Charles), in Texas in 1954. They married the following year, on April 5, 1955. Their first child, Ray Charles Robinson Jr., was born in 1955. Charles was not in town for the birth because he was playing a show in Texas. The couple had two more sons, David and Robert. They raised their children in View Park, California. Charles felt that his heroin addiction took a toll on Della during their marriage. Due to his drug addiction, extramarital affairs on tours and volatile behavior, the marriage deteriorated and she filed for divorce in 1977.

Charles had a six-year-long affair with Margie Hendrix, one of the original Raelettes, and in 1959 they had a son, Charles Wayne. His affair with Mae Mosley Lyles resulted in a daughter, Renee, born in 1961. In 1963, Charles had another daughter, Sheila Ray Charles, by Sandra Jean Betts. Sheila Raye, like her father, was a singer-songwriter; she died of breast cancer on June 15, 2017. In 1977, Charles had a child with his Parisian lover, Arlette Kotchounian, whom he had met ten years earlier. Charles&#x27; longtime girlfriend and partner at the time of his death was Norma Pinella.

Charles fathered a total of 12 children with 10 different women:

* Evelyn Robinson, born in 1949 (daughter with Louise Flowers)
* Ray Charles Robinson Jr., born May 25, 1955 (son with wife Della Bea Robinson)
* David Robinson, born in 1958 (son with wife Della Bea Robinson)
* Charles Wayne Hendricks, born on October 1, 1959 (son with Margie Hendricks, one of the Raelettes)
* Robert Robinson, born in 1960 (son with wife Della Bea Robinson)
* Renee Robinson, born in 1961 (daughter with Mae Mosely Lyles)
* Sheila Robinson, born in 1963 (daughter with Sandra Jean Betts)
* Reatha Butler, born in 1966
* Alexandra Bertrand, born in 1968 (daughter with Mary-Chantal Bertrand)
* Vincent Kotchounian, born in 1977 (son with Arlette Kotchounian)
* Robyn Moffett, born in 1978 (daughter with Gloria Moffett)
* Ryan Corey Robinson den Bok, born in 1987 (son with Mary Anne den Bok)

Charles held a family luncheon for his 12 children in 2002, 10 of whom attended. He told them he was terminally ill and that $500,000 had been placed in trusts for each of them, to be paid out over the next five years.

===Drug abuse and legal problems===
At 18, Charles first tried marijuana when he played in McSon Trio and was eager to try it as he thought it helped musicians create music and tap into their creativity. He later became addicted to heroin for seventeen years. Charles was first arrested in 1955, when he and his bandmates were caught backstage with loose marijuana and drug paraphernalia, including a burnt spoon, syringe, and needle. The arrest did not deter his drug use, which only escalated as he became more successful and made more money.

In 1958, Charles was arrested on a Harlem street corner for possession of narcotics and equipment for administering heroin.

Charles was arrested on a narcotics charge on November 14, 1961, while waiting in an Indiana hotel room before a performance. The detectives seized heroin, marijuana, and other items. Charles, then 31, said he had been a drug addict since the age of 16. The case was dismissed because of the manner in which the evidence was obtained, but Charles&#x27; situation did not improve until a few years later.

On Halloween 1964, Charles was arrested for possession of heroin at Boston&#x27;s Logan Airport. He decided to quit heroin and entered St. Francis Hospital in Lynwood, California, where he endured four days of cold turkey withdrawal. Following his self-imposed stay, he pleaded guilty to four narcotic charges. Prosecutors called for two years in prison and a hefty fine, but the judge listened to Charles&#x27; psychiatrist, Dr. Hacker&#x27;s account of Charles&#x27; determination to get off drugs and he was sent to McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts. The judge offered to postpone the verdict for a year if Charles agreed to undergo regular examinations by government-appointed physicians. When Charles returned to court, he received a five-year suspended sentence, four years of probation, and a fine of $10,000.

Charles responded to the saga of his drug use and reform with the songs &quot;I Don&#x27;t Need No Doctor&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Get Stoned&quot; and the release of &quot;Crying Time&quot;, his first album since kicking his heroin addiction in 1966.

===Chess hobby===
Charles enjoyed playing chess. As part of his therapy when he quit heroin, he met with psychiatrist , who taught him how to play chess. He used a special board with raised squares and holes for the pieces. When questioned if people try to cheat against a blind man, he joked in reply, &quot;You can&#x27;t cheat in Chess... I&#x27;m gonna see that!&quot; In a 1991 concert, he referred to Willie Nelson as &quot;my chess partner&quot;. In 2002, he played and lost to the American grandmaster and former U.S. champion Larry Evans. When Evans complimented him for spotting a tactical trap he had set, Charles replied &quot;Come on man, I play bad, but not &quot;that&quot; bad!&quot;

==Death==
In 2003, Charles had successful hip replacement surgery and was planning to go back on tour, until he began having other ailments. He died on June 10, 2004, at age 73, of complications resulting from liver failure at his home in Beverly Hills, California. His funeral was held at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles eight days later, with numerous musical figures in attendance. B. B. King, Glen Campbell, Stevie Wonder and Wynton Marsalis each played a tribute at the funeral. He was interred in the Inglewood Park Cemetery.

His final album, &quot;Genius Loves Company&quot;, released two months after his death, consists of duets with admirers and contemporaries: B.B. King, Van Morrison, Willie Nelson, James Taylor, Gladys Knight, Michael McDonald, Natalie Cole, Elton John, Bonnie Raitt, Diana Krall, Norah Jones and Johnny Mathis. The album won eight Grammy Awards, including Best Pop Vocal Album, Album of the Year, Record of the Year and Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals (for &quot;Here We Go Again&quot;, with Norah Jones), and Best Gospel Performance (for &quot;Heaven Help Us All&quot;, with Gladys Knight); he also received nods for his duets with Elton John and B.B. King. The album included a version of Harold Arlen and E. Y. Harburg&#x27;s &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, sung as a duet with Johnny Mathis, which was played at Charles&#x27; memorial service.

==Discography==

Charles&#x27; discography is highly complex and extensive. AllMusic has listed approximately 60 original albums and more than 200 compilation albums, while music essayist Robert Christgau noted the existence of more. At least 20 record labels have released near-identical compilations of Charles&#x27; pre-Atlantic Records tracks, while many of the masters that Charles began to own after 1960 were not digitally reissued, leading the Atlantic sister label Rhino Entertainment to focus on rereleasing his mid-to-late 1950s music. Christgau has called Charles&#x27; discography a &quot;monumental mess&quot; and that &quot;any map of his oeuvre must be personal and provisional&quot;.

<doc id="147312" wikidata="Q24651706" url="?curid=147312" title="Cleveland, Yorkshire">
<text>Cleveland is a land of hills and dales from the River Tees to Vale of Pickering, England. The name means &quot;cliff-land&quot;.

The area corresponds to the former Langbaurgh Wapentake. The North York Moors national park, established in 1952, covers part of it. A non-metropolitan county under the same name existed from 1974 to 1996 and there is ambiguity today between that county and the historic extent of the name. It is the ancestral home of Grover Cleveland, who was the 22nd and 24th President of the United States. 

==Heritage==
Cleveland has a centuries-long association with the area from Middlesbrough to Pickering and Thirsk to Whitby, effectively the eastern half of Yorkshire&#x27;s North Riding. Ralph, Archdeacon of Cleveland, was the area&#x27;s first archdeacon recorded, before 1174. A Dukedom of Cleveland was first created in the 17th century.
===Metal===

The Cleveland Hills were key suppliers of the ironstone which was essential to running blast furnaces alongside the River Tees. Cleveland&#x27;s rich ore has created a significant industrial heritage arising from its central role in the 19th century iron boom that led to Middlesbrough growing from a hamlet into a major industrial town in only a matter of decades. Teesport is one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s main ports, initially due to the iron boom, with other heavy industrial plants between Middlesbrough and Redcar.

==Name&#x27;s usage==
Legislation creating the Cleveland Parliamentary constituency (1885–1974) was the first use of Cleveland referring narrowly to land around the River Tees. The constituency was created by the division of the North Riding constituency, and was succeeded in name by the Cleveland and Whitby for the February 1974 general election. The county of Cleveland followed on similar boundaries, also including areas north of the River Tees.

The official name, from 1974, of the &quot;CLEVELAND&quot; (TS postcode was formed from &quot;TeeS&quot; or &quot;Tees-Side&quot;) postal county refers to a larger area including the non-metropolitan county and to the moors.

Cleveland is a common place name in the US and Canada, but relatively few of these places are named directly after this region in England. Many of the towns, as well as two counties and a national forest, are named after US President Grover Cleveland. Other towns are named after the City of Cleveland, Ohio, which in turn was named in honor of Moses Cleaveland, a founder of the city.

==Geographical features==
The area is geographically varied:
*North York Moors
*Howardian Hills
*Roseberry Topping: a distinctive hill. Its original roughly conical form was undercut by extensive mining, giving it a jagged appearance that many have thought reminiscent of the Matterhorn mountain.
* Cleveland Basin
* River Tees
** River Leven
* Eston Nab

==Districts==

*North Yorkshire
*Middlesbrough
*Redcar and Cleveland
*Stockton-on-Tees (south Tees)

==Titles==
* Lord Lieutenant of Cleveland
* High Sheriff of Cleveland
* Duke of Cleveland
* Earl of Cleveland

==See also==
* Cleveland Bay
* Cleveland Way
* Cleveland Mountain Rescue Team
* Cleveland Police and the Cleveland Police and Crime Commissioner
* Cleveland Bridge &amp; Engineering Company, major structural engineering company
* Cleveland Shopping Centre
* Ironstone mining in Cleveland and North Yorkshire

<text>A hike is a long, vigorous walk, usually on trails or footpaths in the countryside. Walking for pleasure developed in Europe during the eighteenth century. Long hikes as part of a religious pilgrimage have existed for a much longer time. 
&quot;Hiking&quot; is the preferred term in Canada and the United States; the term &quot;walking&quot; is used in these regions for shorter, particularly urban walks. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the word &quot;walking&quot; describes all forms of walking, whether it is a walk in the park or backpacking in the Alps. The word hiking is also often used in the UK, along with rambling, [[hillwalking]], and fell walking (a term mostly used for hillwalking in northern England). The term bushwalking is endemic to Australia, having been adopted by the Sydney Bush Walkers Club in 1927. In New Zealand a long, vigorous walk or hike is called [[Hiking|tramping]]. It is a popular activity with numerous hiking organizations worldwide, and studies suggest that all forms of walking have health benefits.

==Related terms==

In the United States, Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, hiking means walking outdoors on a trail, or off trail, for recreational purposes. A day hike refers to a hike that can be completed in a single day. However, in the United Kingdom, the word walking is also used, as well as rambling, while walking in mountainous areas is called hillwalking. In Northern England, Including the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales, fell walking describes hill or mountain walks, as fell is the common word for both features there.

Hiking sometimes involves bushwhacking and is sometimes referred to as such. This specifically refers to difficult walking through dense forest, undergrowth, or bushes where forward progress requires pushing vegetation aside. In extreme cases of bushwhacking, where the vegetation is so dense that human passage is impeded, a machete is used to clear a pathway. The Australian term bushwalking refers to both on and off-trail hiking. Common terms for hiking used by New Zealanders are tramping (particularly for overnight and longer trips), walking or bushwalking. Trekking is the preferred word used to describe multi-day hiking in the mountainous regions of India, Pakistan, Nepal, North America, South America, Iran, and the highlands of East Africa. Hiking a long-distance trail from end-to-end is also referred to as trekking and as thru-hiking in some places. In North America, multi-day hikes, usually with camping, are referred to as backpacking.

==History==
The poet Petrarch is frequently mentioned as an early example of someone hiking. Petrarch recounts that on April 26, 1336, with his brother and two servants, he climbed to the top of Mont Ventoux (), a feat which he undertook for recreation rather than necessity. The exploit is described in a celebrated letter addressed to his friend and confessor, the monk Dionigi di Borgo San Sepolcro, composed some time after the fact. However, some have suggested that Petrarch&#x27;s climb was fictional.

Jakob Burckhardt, in &quot;The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy&quot; (in German in 1860) declared Petrarch &quot;a truly modern man&quot;, because of the significance of nature for his &quot;receptive spirit&quot;; even if he did not yet have the skill to describe nature. Petrarch&#x27;s implication that he was the first to climb mountains for pleasure, and Burckhardt&#x27;s insistence on Petrarch&#x27;s sensitivity to nature have been often repeated since. There are also numerous references to Petrarch as an &quot;alpinist&quot;, although Mont Ventoux is not a hard climb, and is not usually considered part of the Alps. This implicit claim of Petrarch and Burckhardt, that Petrarch was the first to climb a mountain for pleasure since antiquity, was disproven by Lynn Thorndike in 1943. Mount Ventoux was climbed by Jean Buridan, on his way to the papal court in Avignon before the year 1334, &quot;in order to make some meteorological observations&quot;. There were ascents accomplished during the Middle Ages; Lynn Thorndike mentions that &quot;a book on feeling for nature in Germany in the tenth and eleventh centuries, noted various ascents and descriptions of mountains from that period&quot;, and that &quot;in the closing years of his life archbishop Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne (c. 1010 – 1075) climbed his beloved mountain oftener than usual&quot;.

Other early examples of individuals hiking or climbing mountains for pleasure include the Roman Emperor, Hadrian, who ascended Mount Etna during a return trip from Greece in 125 CE. In 1275, Peter III of Aragon claimed to have reached the summit of Pic du Canigou, a 9134-foot mountain located near the southern tip of France. The first ascent of any technical difficulty to be officially verified took place on June 26, 1492, when Antoine de Ville, a chamberlain and military engineer for Charles VIII, King of France, was ordered to ascend Mont Aiguille. Because ropes, ladders and iron hooks were used during the ascent, this event is widely recognized as being the birth of mountaineering. Conrad Gessner, a 16th Century physician, botanist and naturalist from Switzerland, is widely recognized as being the first person to hike and climb for sheer pleasure.

However, the idea of taking a walk in the countryside only really developed during the 18th century in Europe, and arose because of changing attitudes to the landscape and nature associated with the Romantic movement. In 1790 William Wordsworth set off on an extended tour of France, Switzerland, and Germany, which he describes in his autobiographical poem &quot;The Prelude&quot; (1850). Walking tours were popular in the 19th century,
In earlier times walking generally indicated poverty and was also associated with vagrancy. In previous centuries long walks were undertaken as part of religious pilgrimages and this tradition continues throughout the world.

=== Pilgrimages ===

In earlier times people mainly hiked for practical reasons, or on religious pilgrimages. Numerous modern hiking trail follow such ancient routes. The British National Trail the North Downs Way closely follows that of the Pilgrims&#x27; Way to Canterbury.

The ancient pilgrimage, the Camino de Santiago, or Way of St. James, has become more recently the source for a number of long-distance hiking routes. This is a network of pilgrims&#x27; ways leading to the shrine of the apostle Saint James the Great in the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia in northwestern Spain. Many follow its routes as a form of spiritual path or retreat for their spiritual growth.

The French Way is the most popular of the routes and runs from Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port on the French side of the Pyrenees to Roncesvalles on the Spanish side and then another on to Santiago de Compostela through the major cities of Pamplona, Logroño, Burgos and León. A typical walk on the &quot;Camino francés&quot; takes at least four weeks, allowing for one or two rest days on the way. Some travel the Camino on bicycle or on horseback. Paths from the cities of Tours, Vézelay, and Le Puy-en-Velay meet at Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port. The French long-distance path GR 65 (of the Grande Randonnée network), is an important variant route of the old Christian pilgrimage way.

The Abraham Path is a cultural route believed to have been the path of Islamic, Christian, and Jewish patriarch Abraham&#x27;s ancient journey across the Ancient Near East. The path was established in 2007 as a pilgrimage route between Urfa, Turkey, possibly his birthplace, and his final destination of the desert of Negev.
=== German-speaking world ===
The Swiss scientist and poet Albrecht von Haller&#x27;s poem &quot;Die Alpen&quot; (1732) is an historically important early sign of an awakening appreciation of the mountains, though it is chiefly designed to contrast the simple and idyllic life of the inhabitants of the Alps with the corrupt and decadent existence of the dwellers in the plains.

Numerous travellers explored Europe on foot in the last third of the 18th century and recorded their experiences. A significant example is Johann Gottfried Seume, who set out on foot from Leipzig to Sicily in 1801, and returned to Leipzig via Paris after nine months.

===United Kingdom===
Thomas West, a Scottish priest, popularized the idea of walking for pleasure in his guide to the Lake District of 1778. In the introduction he wrote that he aimed to encourage the taste of visiting the lakes by furnishing the traveller with a Guide; and for that purpose, the writer has here collected and laid before him, all the select stations and points of view, noticed by those authors who have last made the tour of the lakes, verified by his own repeated observations. To this end he included various &#x27;stations&#x27; or viewpoints around the lakes, from which tourists would be encouraged to enjoy the views in terms of their aesthetic qualities. Published in 1778 the book was a major success.

Another famous early exponent of walking for pleasure was the English poet William Wordsworth. His famous poem &quot;Tintern Abbey&quot; was inspired by a visit to the Wye Valley made during a walking tour of Wales in 1798 with his sister Dorothy Wordsworth. Wordsworth&#x27;s friend Coleridge was another keen walker and in the autumn of 1799, he and Wordsworth undertook a three-week tour of the Lake District. John Keats, who belonged to the next generation of Romantic poets began, in June 1818, a walking tour of Scotland, Ireland, and the Lake District with his friend Charles Armitage Brown.

More and more people undertook walking tours through the 19th century, of which the most famous is probably Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s journey through the Cévennes in France with a donkey, recorded in his &quot;Travels with a Donkey&quot; (1879). Stevenson also published in 1876 his famous essay &quot;Walking Tours&quot;. The subgenre of travel writing produced many classics in the subsequent 20th century. An early American example of a book that describes an extended walking tour is naturalist John Muir&#x27;s &quot;A Thousand Mile Walk to the Gulf&quot; (1916), a posthumously published account of a long botanizing walk, undertaken in 1867.

Due to industrialisation in England, people began to migrate to the cities where living standards were often cramped and unsanitary. They would escape the confines of the city by rambling about in the countryside. However, the land in England, particularly around the urban areas of Manchester and Sheffield, was privately owned and trespass was illegal. Rambling clubs soon sprang up in the north and began politically campaigning for the legal &#x27;right to roam&#x27;. One of the first such clubs was &#x27;Sunday Tramps&#x27; founded by Leslie White in 1879. The first national grouping, the Federation of Rambling Clubs, was formed in London in 1905 and was heavily patronized by the peerage.

Access to Mountains bills, that would have legislated the public&#x27;s &#x27;right to roam&#x27; across some private land, were periodically presented to Parliament from 1884 to 1932 without success. Finally, in 1932, the Rambler&#x27;s Right Movement organized a mass trespass on Kinder Scout in Derbyshire. Despite attempts on the part of the police to prevent the trespass from going ahead, it was successfully achieved due to massive publicity. However, the Mountain Access Bill that was passed in 1939 was opposed by many walkers&#x27; organizations, including The Ramblers, who felt that it did not sufficiently protect their rights, and it was eventually repealed.

The effort to improve access led after World War II to the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, and in 1951 to the creation of the first national park in the UK, the Peak District National Park. The establishment of this and similar national parks helped to improve access for all outdoors enthusiasts. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 considerably extended the right to roam in England and Wales.

===United States===
An early example of an interest in hiking in the United States is Abel Crawford and his son Ethan&#x27;s clearing of a trail to the summit of Mount Washington, New Hampshire in 1819. This 8.5-mile path is the oldest continually used hiking trail in the United States. The influence of British and European Romanticism reached North America through the transcendentalist movement, and both Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–82) and Henry David Thoreau (1817–62) were important influences on the outdoors movement in North America. Thoreau&#x27;s writing on nature and on walking include the posthumously published &quot;Walking&quot; (1862)&quot;. His earlier essay &quot;A Walk to Wachusett&quot; (1842) describes a four-day walking tour Thoreau took with a companion from Concord, Massachusetts to the summit of Mount Wachusett, Princeton, Massachusetts and back. Established in 1876, the Appalachian Mountain Club has the distinction of being the oldest hiking club in America. It was founded to protect the trails and mountains in the northeastern United States. Prior to its founding, four other hiking clubs had already been established in America. This included the very short-lived (first) Rocky Mountain Club in 1875, the White Mountain Club of Portland in 1873, the Alpine Club of Williamstown in 1863, and the Exploring Circle, which was established by four men from Lynn, Massachusetts in 1850. Although not a hiking club in the same sense as the clubs that would emerge later, the National Park Service recognizes the Exploring Circle as being &quot;the first hiking club in New England.&quot; All four of these clubs would disband within a few years of their founding.

Despite clubs such as the Appalachian Mountain Club, hiking during the early twentieth century was still primarily in New England, San Francisco, and the Pacific Northwest. Eventually, there were similar clubs formed in the Midwest and following the Appalachian range. As interest grew hiking culture was spread throughout the nation.

The Scottish-born, American naturalist John Muir (1838 –1914), was another important early advocate of the preservation of wilderness in the United States. He petitioned the U.S. Congress for the National Park bill that was passed in 1890, establishing Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks. The Sierra Club, which he founded, is now one of the most important conservation organizations in the United States. The spiritual quality and enthusiasm toward nature expressed in his writings inspired others, including presidents and congressmen, to take action to help preserve large areas of undeveloped countryside. He is today referred to as the &quot;Father of the National Parks&quot;. In 1916, the National Park Service was created to protect national parks and monuments.

In 1921, Benton MacKaye, a forester, conceived the idea of what would become America&#x27;s first National Scenic Trail, the Appalachian trail (AT). The AT was completed in August 1937, running from Maine to Georgia. The Pacific Crest Trail (&quot;PCT&quot;) was first explored in the 1930s by the YMCA hiking groups and was eventually registered as a complete border to border trail from Mexico to Canada.

==Destinations==


National parks are often important hiking destinations, such as National Parks of England and Wales; of Canada; of New Zealand, of South Africa, etc.

Frequently, nowadays long-distance hikes (walking tours) are undertaken along long-distance paths, including the National Trails in England and Wales, the Kungsleden (Sweden) and the National Trail System in the United States. The Grande Randonnée (France), Grote Routepaden, or Lange-afstand-wandelpaden (The Netherlands), Grande Rota (Portugal), Gran Recorrido (Spain) is a network of long-distance footpaths in Europe, mostly in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain. There are extensive networks in other European countries of long-distance trails, as well as in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Nepal, and to a lesser extent other Asiatic countries, like Turkey, Israel, and Jordan. In the mountains of Norway, Sweden, Austria, Slovenia, Switzerland, Germany, France, and Italy walking tours can be made from &#x27;hut-to-hut&#x27;, using an extensive system of mountain huts.

In the late 20th-century, there has been a proliferation of official and unofficial long-distance routes, which mean that hikers now are more likely to refer to using a long-distance way (Britain), trail (US), &quot;The Grande Randonnée&quot; (France), etc., than setting out on a walking tour. Early examples of long-distance paths include the Appalachian Trail in the US and the Pennine Way in Britain.

Organized hiking clubs emerged in Europe at approximately the same time as official hiking trails. These clubs established and upheld their own paths during the 19th and 20th centuries, prioritizing the development of extended hiking routes. In 1938, one of the first long-distance hiking trails in Europe, the Hungarian National Blue Trail, was established, stretching approximately 62 miles (100 km).

=== Asia ===

In the Middle East, the Jordan Trail is a 650 km (400 miles) long hiking trail in Jordan established in 2015 by the Jordan Trail Association. And Israel has been described as &quot;a trekker&#x27;s paradise&quot; with over 9,656 km (6,000 miles) of trails.

In southwestern Turkey the Lycian Way is a marked long-distance trail around part of the coast of ancient Lycia. It is over in length and stretches from Hisarönü (Ovacık), near Fethiye, to Geyikbayırı in Konyaaltı about from Antalya. It was conceived by Briton Kate Clow, who lives in Turkey. It takes its name from the ancient civilization, which once ruled the area.

The Great Himalaya Trail is a route across the Himalayas. The original concept of the trail was to establish a single long distance trekking trail from the east end to the west end of Nepal that includes a total of roughly 1,700 kilometres (1,100 mi) of path. The proposed trail will link together a range of the less explored tourism destinations of Nepal&#x27;s mountain region.

=== Latin America ===

In Latin America, Peru and Chile are important hiking destinations. The Inca Trail to Machu Picchu in Peru is very popular and a permit is required. The longest hiking trail in Chile is the informal 3,000 km (1,850 mi) Greater Patagonia Trail that was created by a non-governmental initiative.

=== Africa ===

In Africa a major trekking destination is Mount Kilimanjaro, a dormant volcano in Tanzania, which is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain in the world: above sea level and about above its plateau base.

According to the Kilimanjaro National Park Authority, 467,190 travelers visited Mount Kilimanjaro between 2013 and 2022, with over 45,000 climbers recorded in 2023. 

==Equipment==

The equipment required depends on a variety of factors, such as terrain, climate and time of year. Hikers have traditionally worn sturdy hiking boots for stability, however, in recent decades this has become less common. Boots, however, are still common in mountainous terrain. The Mountaineers club recommends a list of &quot;Ten Essentials&quot; equipment for hiking, including a compass, sunglasses, sunscreen, a head lamp, a first aid kit, a fire starter, and a knife. Other recommend items are a hat, gloves, and an emergency blanket. A GPS navigation device can also be helpful and trekking poles are also recommended, especially when carrying a heavy backpack.

== Environmental impact ==
Natural environments are often fragile and may be accidentally damaged and some species are very sensitive to the presence of humans, especially around mating season. Many hikers adopt the philosophy of Leave No Trace, following strict practices on dealing with food waste, and other impacts on the environment. Fire is a particular source of danger.

== Etiquette ==
Because hikers may come into conflict with other users of the land or may harm the natural environment, hiking etiquette has developed. 
* When two groups of hikers meet on a steep trail, a custom has developed in some areas whereby the group moving uphill has the right-of-way.
* Various organizations recommend that hikers generally avoid making loud sounds, such as shouting or loud conversation, playing music, or the use of mobile phones. However, in bear country, hikers use intentional noise-making as a safety precaution to avoid startling bears.
* The Leave No Trace movement offers a set of guidelines for low-impact hiking: &quot;Leave nothing but footprints. Take nothing but photos. Kill nothing but time. Keep nothing but memories&quot;.
* Hikers are advised not to feed wild animals, because they will become a danger to other hikers if they become habituated to human food, and may have to be killed, or relocated.
* Hikers are advised to verify whether tour operators adhere to fair treatment practices for their support crews, including providing proper wages and working conditions for porters.

==Hazards==
Hiking can be hazardous because of terrain, inclement weather, potential to get lost, or pre-existing medical conditions. The dangerous circumstances hikers can face include specific accidents or physical ailments. It is especially hazardous in high mountains, crossing rivers and glaciers, and when there is snow and ice. At times hiking may involve scrambling, as well as the use of ropes, ice axes and crampons and the skill to properly use them.

Potential hazards involving physical ailments may include dehydration, frostbite, hypothermia, sunburn, sunstroke, or diarrhea, and such injuries as ankle sprains, or broken bones. Hypothermia is a danger for all hikers and especially inexperienced hikers. Weather does not need to be very cold to be dangerous since ordinary rain or mist has a strong cooling effect. In high mountains a further danger is altitude sickness. This typically occurs only above , though some are affected at lower altitudes. Risk factors include a prior episode of altitude sickness, a high degree of activity, and a rapid increase in elevation.

Other threats include attacks by animals (e.g., bears, snakes, and insects such as ticks that carry Lyme) or contact with noxious plants (e.g., poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac. Lightning is also a threat, especially on high ground.

Walkers in high mountains may encounter hazardous snow and ice conditions. Year round glaciers are potentially hazardous. The crossing of rivers may be dangerous and requires special techniques.

===Border crossings===
Borders can be poorly marked and in 2009, Iran imprisoned three Americans for hiking across the Iran-Iraq border. It is illegal to cross into the US on the Pacific Crest Trail from Canada. Going south to north it is more straightforward and a crossing can be made, if advanced arrangements are made with Canada Border Services. Within the Schengen Area, which includes most of the E.U., and associated nations like Switzerland and Norway, there are no impediments to crossing by path, and borders are not always obvious.

==Winter hiking==

Hiking in winter offers additional opportunities, challenges and hazards. Crampons may be needed in icy conditions, and an ice ax is recommended on steep, snow covered paths. Snowshoes and hiking poles, or cross country skis are useful aid for those hiking in deep snow.

Cross country skiing is a form of winter hiking and in Norway the Norwegian Trekking Association maintains over 400 huts stretching across thousands of kilometres of trails which hikers can use in the summer and skiers in the winter. For longer routes in snowy conditions, hikers may resort to ski touring, using special skis and boots.

<text>Buffalo Springfield was a rock band formed in Los Angeles by Canadian musicians Neil Young, Bruce Palmer and Dewey Martin and American musicians Stephen Stills and Richie Furay. The group, widely known for the song &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot;, released three albums and several singles from 1966 to 1968. Their music combined elements of folk music and country music with influences from the British Invasion and psychedelic rock. Like contemporary band the Byrds, they were key to the early development of folk rock. The band took their name from a steamroller parked outside their house.

Buffalo Springfield formed in Los Angeles in 1966 with Stills (guitar, keyboards, vocals), Martin (drums, vocals), Palmer (bass guitar), Furay (guitar, vocals) and Young (guitar, harmonica, piano, vocals). The band signed to Atlantic Records in 1966 and released their debut single &quot;Nowadays Clancy Can&#x27;t Even Sing&quot;, which became a hit in Los Angeles. The following January, they released the protest song &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot;, which became their only US top 10 hit and a counterculture anthem. Their second album, &quot;Buffalo Springfield Again&quot;, marked their progression to psychedelia and hard rock and featured songs such as &quot;Bluebird&quot; and &quot;Mr. Soul&quot;.

After several drug-related arrests and line-up changes, the group disbanded in 1968. Their third and final album, &quot;Last Time Around&quot;, was compiled and released shortly after their dissolution. Stephen Stills went on to form the supergroup Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash with David Crosby of the Byrds and Graham Nash of the Hollies. Neil Young launched his solo career and later joined Stills in Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young in 1969. Furay, along with Jim Messina, went on to form the country-rock band Poco. Buffalo Springfield was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, and briefly reunited for a comeback tour in 2011.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Neil Young and Stephen Stills met in 1965, at the Fourth Dimension in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Young was there with the Squires, a Winnipeg group he had been leading since February 1963, and Stills was on tour with the Company, a spin-off from the Au Go Go Singers. When Stills&#x27; band broke up at the end of that tour, he moved to the West Coast, where he worked as a session musician and auditioned unsuccessfully for, among other bands, the Monkees. Told by record producer Barry Friedman there would be work available if he could assemble a band, Stills invited fellow Au Go Go Singers alumnus Richie Furay and former Squires bass player Ken Koblun to come join him in California. Both agreed, although Koblun chose to leave before very long and joined the group 3&#x27;s a Crowd.

While in Toronto in early 1966, Young met Bruce Palmer, a Canadian who was playing bass for the Mynah Birds. In need of a lead guitarist, Palmer invited Young to join the group, and Young accepted. The Mynah Birds were set to record an album for Motown Records when their singer Ricky James Matthews, later known as Rick James, was tracked down and arrested by the U.S. Navy for being AWOL.

With their record deal cancelled, Young and Palmer pawned the Mynah Birds&#x27; musical equipment and bought a 1953 Pontiac hearse, which they drove to Los Angeles. Young and Palmer arrived in L.A. hoping to meet Stephen Stills, who, as Young had learned, was living in the city. However, after almost a week of searching clubs and coffeehouses, the pair had been unable to find Stills. Consequently, on April 6, 1966, Young and Palmer decided to leave Los Angeles and drive north to San Francisco. While the two were stuck in traffic on Sunset Boulevard, they were spotted by Stills and Richie Furay, who were heading the other direction down Sunset. Stills and Furay managed to switch lanes and maneuver behind Young&#x27;s hearse, at which point the musicians pulled off the road and reunited.

Drummer Dewey Martin, who had played with garage rock group the Standells and with country artists such as Patsy Cline and the Dillards, joined at the suggestion of the Byrds&#x27; manager, Jim Dickson. The group&#x27;s name was taken from a brand of steamroller made by the Buffalo-Springfield Roller Company. The new group debuted on 11 April 1966, at The Troubadour in West Hollywood, five days after the chance encounter on Sunset Boulevard. A few days later, they began a short tour of California as the opening act for the Dillards and the Byrds.

=== Management and first recordings ===
Chris Hillman of the Byrds persuaded the owners of the Whisky a Go Go to give Buffalo Springfield an audition, and they essentially became the house band at the Whisky for seven weeks, from May 2 to June 18, 1966. This series of concerts solidified the band&#x27;s reputation for live performances and attracted interest from a number of record labels. It also brought an invitation from Friedman to Dickie Davis (who had been the Byrds&#x27; lighting manager) to become involved in the group&#x27;s management. In turn, Davis sought advice from Sonny &amp; Cher&#x27;s management team, Charlie Greene and Brian Stone; unbeknownst to Davis and Friedman, Greene and Stone then aggressively pitched themselves to the band to be their new managers. Friedman was fired, and Davis was made the group&#x27;s tour manager. Greene and Stone made a deal with Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic Records for a four-album contract with a $12,000 advance, following a brief bidding war with Elektra Records and Warner Bros. Records, and arranged for the band to start recording at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood.

The first Buffalo Springfield single, &quot;Nowadays Clancy Can&#x27;t Even Sing&quot;, was released in August, but made little impact outside Los Angeles, where it reached the top 25. Young and Stills have long maintained that their own mono mix was superior to the stereo mix engineered by Greene and Stone. The band&#x27;s eponymous album was released by Atlantic subsidiary Atco in mono and in stereo in October 1966. A revamped version issued both in mono and stereo with a different track order was issued in March of the following year.

In November 1966, Stills composed &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot;, responding to a protest that had turned violent following the closing of the Pandora&#x27;s Box nightclub on Sunset Strip. The song was performed on Thanksgiving night at the Whisky a Go Go, recorded within the next few days, and on the air in Los Angeles on radio station KHJ soon afterwards. By March 1967, it was a top ten hit. Atco took advantage of this momentum by replacing the song &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Scold Me&quot; with &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot; and re-releasing the album. &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot; sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc.

=== Lineup changes, arrest, and breakup ===
In January 1967, Palmer was deported for possession of marijuana but returned to the group at the beginning of June, while Young was temporarily absent (guitarist Doug Hastings filled in for Young during this period). The band, with David Crosby sitting in, played the Monterey Pop Festival. Young returned in August and the band severed ties with Greene and Stone, then divided its time between playing gigs and finalising the second album, ultimately titled &quot;Buffalo Springfield Again&quot;. Produced by Ertegun, &quot;Buffalo Springfield Again&quot; was released in November 1967. It includes &quot;Mr. Soul&quot;, &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Woman&quot;, &quot;Bluebird&quot;, &quot;Sad Memory&quot;, and &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;. The band toured as support for the Beach Boys during early 1968. In January of that year, after Palmer was again deported for drug possession, Jim Messina, who had worked as engineer on the band&#x27;s second album, was hired as a permanent replacement on bass. During this period Young began to appear less and less frequently, and he often left Stills to handle lead guitar parts at concerts. Recording sessions were booked, and all the songs that appeared on the final album were recorded by the end of March, usually with Messina producing.

In the Netflix documentary &quot;Echo in the Canyon&quot;, Stills related an incident that illustrated the band&#x27;s problems with law enforcement. The band were hosting a small rehearsal party, attended by Eric Clapton among others, in April 1968. Despite reportedly playing at a comfortable sound level, a police officer arrived after a disturbing the peace complaint. During the encounter, the officer smelled marijuana and Stills ran next door to &quot;call lawyers,&quot; but in actuality went next door and escaped out the bathroom window. According to Stills, Young was going to chase the police down the street, to which Stills said &quot;cause he&#x27;s Canadian and I guess in Canada you can do that&quot;. Ultimately, Young, Furay and Messina were arrested and sent to the Los Angeles County Jail.

Following a gig at the Long Beach Auditorium on 5 May 1968, the band held a meeting with Ertegun to arrange their breakup. Stills and Furay stayed with Atlantic, while Young moved to Warner Brothers. Later, Furay and Messina compiled various tracks recorded between mid-1967 and early 1968 into the third and final studio album, &quot;Last Time Around&quot; (1968).

== New Buffalo Springfield and reunion attempts ==
Martin formed a new version of Buffalo Springfield in September 1968. Dubbed New Buffalo Springfield, the lineup consisted of guitarists Dave Price (Davy Jones&#x27;s stand-in with the Monkees), Gary Rowles (son of jazz pianist Jimmy Rowles) who later joined Arthur Lee&#x27;s Love, bass player Bob Apperson, drummer Don Poncher (also later a member of Love), and horn player Jim Price, who later became a top session musician for Delaney Bramlett, the Rolling Stones, Joe Cocker and others.

The new band toured extensively and appeared at the highly publicized Holiday Rock Festival in San Francisco on 25–26 December 1968, but soon ran afoul of Stills and Young, who took legal action to prevent Martin from using the band&#x27;s name. Following an agreement to give up future royalties from Buffalo Springfield&#x27;s recordings, Martin was allowed to use the name &quot;New Buffalo&quot;. He attempted to retrieve his rights in 1974 and though the matter was settled out of court, he felt that he had been mistreated.

In February 1969, Martin and Dave Price formed a second version of New Buffalo with guitarist Bob &quot;BJ&quot; Jones and bass player Randy Fuller, brother of the late Bobby Fuller. The band made some recordings with producer Tom Dowd overseeing, but they were scrapped. Another guitarist, Joey Newman (formerly of Don and the Goodtimes, later of the pioneering prog group Touch), was added in June 1969, but two months later Martin was fired, and the remaining members carried on as Blue Mountain Eagle. Martin then formed a new group called Medicine Ball, which released a lone album in 1970 for Uni Records. Martin also released two solo singles, one for Uni and one for RCA, which did not appear on the album. During the 1970s, he retired from the music industry and became a car mechanic.

In 1984, Bruce Palmer teamed up with Frank Wilks (vocals, guitar), Stan Endersby (guitar) and Alan Prosser (drums) to form the Springfield Band, which became Buffalo Springfield Revisited in 1985 when Dewey Martin was brought up to Toronto to join, and off they went on tour for the next three to four years under this band name (though Martin dropped out by 1987). Neil Young and Stephen Stills gave Buffalo Springfield Revisited permission to tour with that name.

In July 1986, Palmer, Martin, Furay, Young and Stills gathered at Stills&#x27; house, with Buffalo Springfield Revisited keyboardist Harlan Spector, to rehearse for an apparent reunion tour. One of the 1986 rehearsals was video recorded. It was the last time all five original members performed together. Plans for a subsequent reunion tour were abandoned.

By 1990, Bruce Palmer and Frank Wilks had moved to Topanga, California, where Dennis Knicely joined to perform percussion. The following year they started White Buffalo along with Dewey Martin and others, then Martin formed the short lived Buffalo Springfield Again in 1991 with Billy Darnell (guitar), Robin Lambe (bass) and Michael Curtis (vocals, guitar). But Furay issued a cease and desist order on Martin in 1992, and Martin retired from music again the following year.

== 2010–11 reunion ==
On his album &quot;Silver &amp; Gold&quot; (2000), Young sang of his desire to re-form the group and to &quot;see those guys again and give it a shot&quot; in &quot;Buffalo Springfield Again&quot;. Palmer (2004) and Martin (2009) later died, preventing a reunion of the original lineup.

Young, Stills and Furay reunited at the annual Bridge School Benefit concerts on October 23 and 24, 2010, in Mountain View, California. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the performance &quot;nostalgic, blissful, and moving&quot;.

The band reunited for six concerts starting in Oakland on 1 June 2011, followed by dates in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, before moving on to play the 2011 Bonnaroo Music &amp; Arts Festival in Manchester, Tennessee. The band consisted of Furay, Stills, Young, Rick Rosas and Joe Vitale.&lt;ref name=&quot;WashPost 2011/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to Furay and a band spokesman, the group planned a full tour in 2012, but this was delayed because Young was recording two new albums with Crazy Horse. On 27 February 2012, Furay announced that the band was on indefinite hiatus.

== Legacy ==
In 1968, Stills went on to form Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash with David Crosby of the Byrds and Graham Nash of the Hollies. Meanwhile, Furay and Messina formed Poco, and Young launched his solo career. In 1969, Young reunited with Stills in Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. After Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, Stills joined with another former Byrd Chris Hillman (after his stint with the Flying Burrito Brothers) and others to form the group Manassas (1971–1973). Later, Furay joined JD Souther and Chris Hillman to form the Souther-Hillman-Furay Band, and Messina teamed with Kenny Loggins in Loggins &amp; Messina.

In 1982–1983, Palmer was a bassist on Young&#x27;s album &quot;Trans&quot; and toured with him in America and Europe, as seen on &quot;Neil Young in Berlin&quot;, filmed in 1982.

In 1997, Buffalo Springfield was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. A four-disc box set assembled by Young, &quot;Buffalo Springfield&quot;, was released in 2001. A further box set &quot;What&#x27;s That Sound? Complete Albums Collection&quot; was released in 2018 by Rhino Records.
