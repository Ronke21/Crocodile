<text>Air Canada is the flag carrier and the largest airline of Canada, by size and passengers carried. Air Canada is headquartered in the borough of Saint-Laurent in the city of Montreal. The airline, founded in 1937, provides scheduled and charter air transport for passengers and cargo to 222 destinations worldwide. It operates major hubs at Montréal–Trudeau, Toronto–Pearson and Vancouver. Air Canada is a founding member of the Star Alliance.

Canada&#x27;s national airline originated from the Canadian federal government&#x27;s 1936 creation of Trans-Canada Air Lines (TCA), which began operating its first transcontinental flight routes in 1938. In 1965, TCA was renamed Air Canada following government approval. After the deregulation of the Canadian airline market in the 1980s, the airline was privatized in 1988. On 4 January 2000, Air Canada took over its largest rival, Canadian Airlines. In 2003, the airline filed for bankruptcy protection and in the following year emerged and reorganized under the holding company ACE Aviation Holdings. In 2019, Air Canada flew 51.5 million passengers. In October 2021, the Government of Canada acquired 6.4% of Air Canada in return for financial support to mitigate the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Air Canada has a fleet of Airbus A330, Boeing 777, and Boeing 787 Dreamliner wide-body aircraft for use on long-haul routes and uses the Airbus A320 family aircraft (including the A319, A320, and A321 variants), Boeing 737 MAX 8, and Airbus A220-300 aircraft on short-haul routes. The carrier&#x27;s operating divisions include Air Canada Cargo, Air Canada Express, Air Canada Jetz (private jet charters), and Air Canada Rouge (leisure airline). Its subsidiary, Air Canada Vacations, provides vacation packages to over 90 destinations. Together with its regional partners, the airline operates on average more than 1,613 scheduled flights daily.

==History==
===Trans-Canada Air Lines (1937–1965)===

Air Canada&#x27;s predecessor, Trans-Canada Air Lines (TCA), was created by federal legislation as a subsidiary of Canadian National Railway (CNR) on 11 April 1937. The newly created Department of Transport under Minister C. D. Howe desired an airline under government control to link cities on the Atlantic coast to those on the Pacific coast. Using $5 million in Crown seed money, two Lockheed Model 10 Electras and one Boeing Stearman biplane were purchased from Canadian Airways and experienced airline executives from United Airlines and American Airlines were brought in.

Passenger flights began on 1 September 1937, with an Electra carrying two passengers and mail from Vancouver to Seattle, a $14.20 round trip, and, on 1 July 1938, TCA hired its first flight attendants. Transcontinental routes from Montreal to Vancouver began on 1 April 1939, using 12 Lockheed Model 14 Super Electras and six Lockheed Model 18 Lodestars. By January 1940, the airline had grown to about 579 employees.

Canadian Pacific Airlines (CP Air) suggested in 1942 a merger with TCA. Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King rejected the proposal and introduced legislation regulating TCA as the only airline in Canada allowed to provide transcontinental flights. With the increase in air travel after World War II, CP Air was granted one coast-to-coast flight and a few international routes.

Originally headquartered in Winnipeg, also the site of its national maintenance base, the federal government moved TCA&#x27;s headquarters to Montreal in 1949; the maintenance base would later also move east. With the development of the ReserVec in 1953, TCA became the first airline in the world to use a computer reservation system with remote terminals.

===Renamed to Air Canada and early years (1965–1990)===

By 1964, TCA had grown to become Canada&#x27;s national airline and, in 1964, Jean Chrétien submitted a private member&#x27;s bill to change the name of the airline from Trans-Canada Airlines to &quot;Air Canada&quot;, which TCA had long used as its French-language name. This bill failed but it was later resubmitted and passed, with the name change taking effect on 1 January 1965. Elizabeth II, the Queen of Canada, flew on the first aircraft to bear the name and livery of Air Canada when she departed for the United Kingdom at the end of her 1964 tour of Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Ontario.

During the 1970s, government regulations ensured Air Canada&#x27;s dominance over domestic regional carriers and rival CP Air. Short-haul carriers were each restricted to one of five regions, and could not compete directly with Air Canada and CP Air. CP Air was subject to capacity limits on intercontinental flights, and restricted from domestic operations. Air Canada&#x27;s fares were also subject to regulation by the government.
In 1976, with reorganization at CNR, Air Canada became an independent Crown corporation. The &quot;Air Canada Act&quot; of 1978 ensured that the carrier would compete on a more equal footing with rival regional airlines and CP Air, and ended the government&#x27;s direct regulatory control over Air Canada&#x27;s routings, fares, and services. The act also transferred ownership from Canadian National Railway to a subsidiary of the national government. Deregulation of the Canadian airline market, under the new &quot;National Transportation Act, 1987&quot; officially opened the airline market in Canada to equal competition. The carrier&#x27;s fleet expansion saw the acquisition of Boeing 727, Boeing 747, and Lockheed Tristar jetliners. In 1978 Judy Cameron became the first female pilot hired to fly for any major Canadian carrier when she was hired to fly by Air Canada.

With new fleet expenditures outpacing earnings, Air Canada officials indicated that the carrier would need additional sources of capital to fund its modernization. By 1985 the Canadian government was indicating a willingness to privatize both Canadian National Railways and Air Canada. In 1988, Air Canada was privatized, and 43% of shares were sold on the public market, with the initial public offering completed in October of that year. By this time, long-haul rival CP Air had become Canadian Airlines International following its acquisition by Pacific Western Airlines.

On 7 December 1987, Air Canada became the first airline in the world with a fleet-wide non-smoking policy, and in 1989 became completely privatized. The successful privatization program was led by the President and CEO, Pierre J. Jeanniot. The associated extensive communication activities were aided by the Non-Executive Chairman, Claude I. Taylor.

===Strategic changes (1990s)===
In the early 1990s, Air Canada encountered financial difficulties as the airline industry slumped in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War. In response, the airline restructured management by hiring former Delta Air Lines executive Hollis L. Harris as its CEO. Harris restructured the airline&#x27;s operations, reduced management positions, moved the corporate headquarters to Dorval Airport, and sold the &quot;enRoute&quot; card business to Diners Club in 1992. By 1994, Air Canada returned to profitability. The same year also saw the carrier winning route access to fly from Canada to the new Kansai Airport in Osaka, Japan.

In 1995, taking advantage of a new US-Canada open skies agreement, Air Canada added 30 new trans-border routes. In May 1997, Air Canada became a founding member of the Star Alliance, with the airline launching codeshares with several of the alliance&#x27;s members. The second half of the 1990s saw the airline earn consistent profits, totalling $1 billion for the 1997 to 1999 period.

On 2 September 1998, pilots for Air Canada launched the company&#x27;s first pilots&#x27; strike, demanding higher wages. At the end of 1999, the Canadian government relaxed some aviation regulations, aiming to consolidate the Canadian airline industry. That year, American Airlines in conjunction with Canadian financial company Onex Corp, launched takeover bids for ailing rival Canadian Airlines and Air Canada, spurring Air Canada to submit a competing offer for its largest rival.

===Merger and reorganization (2000s)===

In January 2000, Air Canada acquired Canada&#x27;s second-largest air carrier, Canadian Airlines International, merging the latter&#x27;s operations, becoming the world&#x27;s twelfth-largest airline in the first decade of the 21st century. As Air Canada gained access to its former rival&#x27;s financial statements, officials learned that the carrier was in worse financial shape than was previously believed. An expedited merger strategy was pursued, but in summer 2000 integration efforts led to flight delays, luggage problems and other frustrations. Service improved following Air Canada officials&#x27; pledge to do so by January 2001. The airline was confronted by the global aviation market downturn and increased competition, posting back-to-back losses in 2001 and 2002.

====Bankruptcy and restructuring====
As Air Canada had employed a scorched earth policy to prevent the Onex proposed acquisition as one of its lines of defense, it had burdened itself with onerous contracts with almost all of its suppliers. As a result, on 1 April 2003, Air Canada filed for protection under the Companies&#x27; Creditors Arrangement Act; it emerged from this protection on 30 September 2004, 18 months later. During the period of bankruptcy protection, the company was subject to two competing bids from Cerberus Capital Management and Victor Li. The Cerberus bid would have seen former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney installed as chairman, being recruited by Cerberus&#x27; international advisory board chair Dan Quayle, the former vice-president of the United States. Cerberus was rejected because it had a reputation of changing existing employee pension agreements, a move strongly opposed by the CAW. At first, Air Canada selected Victor Li&#x27;s &quot;Trinity Time Investments&quot;, which initially asked for a board veto and the chairmanship in return for investing $650 million in the airline. Li, who holds dual citizenship from Canada and Hong Kong, later demanded changes to the pension plan (which was not in his original takeover bid), but since the unions refused to budge, the bid was withdrawn.

Finally, Deutsche Bank unveiled an $850 million financing package for Air Canada, if it would cut $200 million in annual costs in addition to the $1.1 billion that the unions agreed on in 2003. The offer was accepted after last-minute talks between CEO Robert Milton and CAW president Buzz Hargrove resulted in union concessions.

ACE Aviation Holdings became the new parent company under which the reorganized Air Canada was held.

In October 2004, Canadian singer Celine Dion became the face of Air Canada, hoping to relaunch the airline and draw in a more international market after 18 months of bankruptcy protection. She recorded her single, &quot;You and I&quot;, which subsequently appeared in several Air Canada commercials.

====Fleet modernization====

On 31 October 2004, the last Air Canada Boeing 747 flight landed in Toronto from Frankfurt as AC873, ending 33 years of 747 service with the airline. The Boeing 747-400 fleet was replaced by the Airbus A340 fleet. On 19 October 2004, Air Canada unveiled a new aircraft colour scheme and uniforms. A Boeing 767-300ER was painted in the new silver-blue colour, and the dark green/almost black tail was replaced with a new version of the maple leaf known as the &#x27;Frosted Leaf&#x27;.

On 9 November 2005, Air Canada agreed to renew its widebody fleet by purchasing 16 Boeing 777s (10 -300ERs, 6 -200LRs), and 14 Boeing 787-8s. It placed options on 18 Boeing 777s and 46 Boeing 787-8s and -9s. Deliveries of the 777s began in March 2007 and deliveries of the 787s began in May 2014.

On 24 April 2007, Air Canada exercised half of its options for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The firm order for the Dreamliners then stood at 37 plus 23 options, for a total of 60. The airline also cancelled orders for two Boeing 777Fs. In November 2007, Air Canada leased an additional Boeing 777-300ER.

====Project XM====
Started in July 2006 and since completed, &quot;Project XM: Extreme Makeover&quot;, was a $300 million aircraft interior replacement project to install new cabins on all aircraft. New aircraft such as the Boeing 777 were delivered with the new cabins factory installed.
New cabin features included:
* In Executive First, new horizontal fully flat Executive First Suites (on Boeing 767s, Boeing 777s, and Airbus A330s).
* New seats in all classes on all aircraft, with new entertainment options.
* Personal AVOD ( touchscreen LCD) in Economy class (domestic and international) and Executive Class (domestic).
* Larger AVOD ( touchscreen LCD) equipped with noise-cancelling Sennheiser headphones available in Executive First Suites.
* Interactive games at all seats in Executive and Economy; XM Radio Canada available at every seat.
* USB ports to recharge electronic devices and for game controllers at all seats; 120 VAC plugs in most seats; 
** In Economy (2 per triple) (1 per double) (3 per quad). 
** In First Class/Executive (All seats)

====Late 2000s financial difficulties====
High fuel prices and the Great Recession caused Air Canada significant financial difficulties in the late 2000s. In June 2008, the airline announced it would lay off over 2,000 employees and cut its capacity by 7 percent by the first quarter of 2009. President and CEO Montie Brewer expressed confidence that the airline would weather the economic downturn.

Brewer resigned on 30 March 2009 and was replaced by Calin Rovinescu on 1 April. Rovinescu became the first Canadian President since Claude Taylor in 1992. Rovinescu, reported to be &quot;an enforcer&quot;, was Air Canada&#x27;s chief restructuring officer during its 2003 bankruptcy; he resigned that year after unions rejected his demands.

Air Canada&#x27;s contracts with four unions also expired around this time. The airline stated that its $2.85 billion pension shortfall (which grew from $1.2 billion in 2007) was a &quot;liquidity risk&quot; in its first-quarter report, and it required new financing and pension &quot;relief&quot; to conserve cash for 2010 operations. The company was obligated to pay $650 million into the pension fund but it suffered a 2009 Q1 loss of $400 million, so it requested a moratorium on its pension payments in 2009. The unions had insisted on financial guarantees before agreeing on a deal. Rejecting union calls for a direct bailout of the company, federal finance minister Jim Flaherty instead appointed retired judge James Farley to mediate pension issues between the company, the unions representing its employees, and retirees. Farley had presided over the company&#x27;s 2003 bankruptcy.

In July 2009, Air Canada requested and received CA$1 billion in financial aid from a consortium of entities, including the Canadian government, ACE, and associate company Aeroplan. The Centre for Aviation reported that only CA$600 million was actually loaned to Air Canada; the rest of the money was from sale-leaseback accounting and &quot;aggregating an array of biscuit-tin savings&quot;.

===2010s===
In December 2010, ACE sold 44 million Air Canada shares, followed by the remaining 31 million shares in November 2012 to Cormark Securities Inc.

==== New branding and fleet ====

On 9 February 2017, a new retro red and black aircraft livery was launched, to coincide with Air Canada&#x27;s 80th anniversary and Canada&#x27;s 150th anniversary of Confederation. The update includes design aspects from the logo used between 1964 and 1992, with an overall white colour scheme, with a black underside, tail fin with red maple leaf rondelle, black &quot;Air Canada&quot; lettering with a red maple leaf rondelle underneath, and a black &quot;mask&quot; surrounding the cockpit windows. 

In December 2013, Air Canada ordered 61 Boeing 737 MAX single-aisle narrow body aircraft to replace its existing fleet of Airbus A320 series aircraft with the first MAX 8 variant delivered on 2 November 2017. Some Airbus A319s will be transferred to Air Canada&#x27;s Rouge subsidiary, with the remaining fleet retired. As part of the deal, Boeing purchased 25 Embraer E190s from Air Canada that were retired in 2016. The same year, Air Canada signed an agreement with Bombardier Aerospace to replace the E190s with Airbus A220/CSeries aircraft from 2019.

In July 2017, Air Canada reintroduced Premium Economy on its North American wide-body flights.

In April 2018, Air Canada rebranded its international business class cabin as Air Canada Signature Class. Passengers could expect an enhanced menu, including the new Air Canada Signature Cocktail, as well as new amenity kits, a chauffeur service (using BMW vehicles) at its hubs during domestic to international connections, and access to the Air Canada Signature Suite at Toronto Pearson International Airport. On select North American routes, Air Canada Signature Service is offered on widebody aircraft.

In May 2018, Air Canada listed Taiwan as part of China to comply with a requirement of China&#x27;s civil aviation administration. On 6 June 2018, Air Canada and Air China signed a joint venture, the first joint venture between a North American and Chinese airline.

====Proposed acquisition of Transat A.T.====
On 16 May 2019, Air Canada announced it was in exclusive talks to buy Transat A.T., the parent company that owns Air Transat, for CA$520 million.

On 27 June 2019, Transat A.T. agreed to be purchased by Air Canada for CA$13 per share. On 11 August 2019, Air Canada raised the purchase price of Transat A.T. to CA$18 per share. The overall value of the deal was now $720 million. On 23 August 2019, 95% of Transat A.T. shareholders approved the acquisition by Air Canada on that basis. The agreement was revised downwards in October 2020 to CA$5 per share, reflecting the challenges posed to the airline industry by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The plan was &quot;expected to face intense scrutiny from the Competition Bureau and other regulatory authorities, including in Europe&quot;, according to CBC News. While the Government of Canada approved the takeover on 11 February 2021, it was dropped in April 2021 following a failure to secure European Commission approval.

=== 2020s ===
==== COVID-19 pandemic ====
Travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic forced Air Canada to heavily restrict service. On 18 March 2020, the airline announced it would suspend most of its flights by 31 March. Service began to return to normal on 22 May, with flights to more cities being added over the summer. In its first quarterly financial report, Air Canada announced it had lost CA$1.05 billion, compared to a profit of CA$345 million in Q1 2019. The airline similarly suffered in the third quarter, reporting a loss of CA$685 million. It stated capacity in the fourth quarter of the 2020 fiscal year would be 75 percent lower than the previous year. In June 2022, after the provincial governments across the country began lifting pandemic-era restrictions, Air Canada announced it was cancelling over 150 daily flights in the summer due to unprecedented and unexpected pressure in the aviation industry.

In April 2021, the Government of Canada acquired 6.4% of Air Canada as a part of a $5.9 billion COVID-19 related assistance package, and has not ruled out further investment.

In September 2022, Air Canada welcomed the Government of Canada&#x27;s decision to lift remaining COVID-19 restrictions, including requirements for wearing masks on aircraft, testing and quarantine, and the compulsory use of ArriveCAN beginning 1 October 2022 and noted that the measures were not justified by science.

==Corporate affairs==
===Business trends===
Air Canada had been loss-making for several years, but was profitable from 2012; however, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company was again loss-making in 2020. The key trends for the Air Canada group, including Air Canada Express and Air Canada &quot;rouge&quot;, are (years ending 31 December):

===Ownership===
Air Canada became fully privatized in 1989, and its variable voting shares are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX:AC), and, since 29 July 2016, on OTCQX International Premier in the US under the single ticker symbol &quot;ACDVF&quot;. As of April 2021, the Government of Canada owns approximately 6.4% of Air Canada.

Currently, the Air Canada Public Participation Act (ACPPA) limits ownership of Air Canada&#x27;s voting interests by non-residents of Canada to a maximum of 25%. The Canada Transportation Act (CTA) also requires that Canadians own and control at least 75% of the voting interests of licensed Canadian carriers. Accordingly, Air Canada&#x27;s articles contain restrictions to ensure that it remains &quot;Canadian&quot; as defined under the CTA.

====Executives====
Prior to 1976, Air Canada was a department of the Canadian National Railway (CNR), helmed by a department head who reported to the President of CNR. Since 1976, the following have been CEO and President:

===Headquarters and Operations Centre===
By federal law (&quot;Air Canada Public Participation Act&quot;), Air Canada is obligated to keep its head office in Montreal. Its corporate headquarters is Air Canada Centre (French: &quot;Centre Air Canada&quot;), also known as La Rondelle (&quot;The Puck&quot; in French), a 7-storey building located on the grounds of Montréal–Trudeau International Airport in Saint-Laurent.

In 1975, Air Canada was headquartered at 1 Place Ville-Marie in Montreal.
In 1990, the airline moved its headquarters to the airport to cut costs.

Air Canada&#x27;s Operations Centre is located in Brampton, Ontario, and oversees all flight operations including dispatching and crew scheduling. It has an off-site disaster recovery site and is typically unused.

===Subsidiaries===
====Air Canada Cargo====
Air Canada Cargo is the company&#x27;s freight carrying division based at Toronto-Pearson, offering more than 150 shipping destinations through the Air Canada airline network, ground logistics and airline partners. Its route network has focused on European destinations through Eastern Canada departure points, along with direct services from Vancouver and Calgary to Frankfurt, London, Paris, and Zurich.

In Toronto, a new cargo terminal was completed in early 2002 which featured modernised inventory and conveyor systems. Cargo terminals are also found in Vancouver and Montreal.

On 17 April 2023, a grand theft occurred at the Air Canada cargo terminal at Toronto Pearson International Airport. A container containing gold bars and currency valued at over C$20 million was stolen. Two Air Canada employees allegedly participated in this theft.

====Air Canada Express====

Air Canada Express is the brand name of Air Canada&#x27;s regional feeder service operated by independent carriers Jazz Aviation and PAL Airlines.

====Air Canada Jetz====

Launched in 2002, Air Canada Jetz is a charter service targeting sports teams, professional entertainers, and corporations. The Air Canada Jetz fleet consists of Airbus A319 and A320 aircraft in an all business class configuration. In February 2014, Air Canada decided to leave the sports charter business. However, on 17 March 2015, Air Canada announced an agreement with several NHL teams to provide charter services under the Air Canada Jetz brand for six years starting from the 2015–2016 NHL season.

====Air Canada Rouge====

Launched in December 2012, Air Canada Rouge is a subsidiary of Air Canada. Air Canada Rouge serves predominantly leisure destinations in Europe, the Caribbean, South America, Central America, Mexico and the United States using Airbus A319, Airbus A320, and Airbus A321.

====Air Canada Vacations====

Air Canada Vacations offers Executive Class service on select flights, nonstop flights from major Canadian cities and daily flights to many destinations.

====Aeroplan====

Aeroplan is Air Canada&#x27;s loyalty marketing program operated by Groupe Aeroplan Inc., which was spun off from Air Canada in 2005. Air Canada re-purchased Aeroplan from Aimia Inc in January 2019.

===Former subsidiaries===
====Air Canada Jazz====

In 2001, Air Canada consolidated its wholly owned regional carriers Air BC, Air Nova, Air Ontario, and Canadian Regional Airlines into Air Canada Regional Incorporated. Several of these air carriers had previously operated as an &quot;Air Canada Connector&quot;. In 2002, the consolidation was completed with the creation of a new brand, Air Canada Jazz. Air Canada Jazz was spun off in November 2006. ACE Aviation Holdings is no longer a shareholder of Jazz Aviation LP, making it an independent company. &quot;Air Canada Jazz&quot; was the brand name of Air Canada&#x27;s main regional product from 2002 to 2011. As of June 2011, the &quot;Air Canada Jazz&quot; brand is no longer being marketed as all regional operators adopted the &quot;Air Canada Express&quot; name. Jazz Aviation is the largest of these affiliates, operating 125 aircraft on behalf of Air Canada.

====Air Canada Tango====

On 1 November 2001, Air Canada launched &quot;Air Canada Tango&quot;, designed to offer no-frills service and lower fares using a dedicated fleet of 13 Airbus A320s in an all economy configuration of 159 seats. In Canada, it operated from Toronto to Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Regina, Saskatoon, Thunder Bay, Ottawa, Montreal, Halifax, Gander and St. John&#x27;s. In addition, it operated non-stop service between Toronto and Fort Lauderdale, Orlando and Tampa; as well as non-stop service between Montreal and Fort Lauderdale and Orlando. Tango was intended to compete with Canada 3000. The Tango service was dissolved in 2004. Air Canada once called its lowest fare class &quot;Tango&quot;. As of 2018, Air Canada has renamed the Tango fare class to Standard fare.

====Zip====

In 2002, Air Canada launched a discount airline to compete directly with WestJet on routes in Western Canada. Zip operated ex-Canadian Airlines International 737-200s as a separate airline with its own staff and brightly painted aircraft. It was disbanded in 2004.

==Destinations and Hubs==

Air Canada has three classes of service, Business/Signature, Premium Economy, and Economy. On most long-haul international and short-haul routes operated by widebody aircraft, &quot;Signature Class&quot;, &quot;Premium Economy&quot;, and &quot;Economy Class&quot; are offered; most short-haul and domestic routes feature &quot;Business Class&quot; and &quot;Economy Class&quot;. All mainline seats feature AVOD (Audio Video On Demand) and mood lighting. Air Canada Express features &quot;Business Class&quot; and &quot;Economy Class&quot;, on CRJ900 and Embraer E175 aircraft; all other Air Canada Express aircraft have one-class economy cabins. All narrowbody mainline aircraft, as well as Air Canada Express CRJ900 and Embraer E175 aircraft have onboard Wi-Fi installed, which is also being installed on all widebody aircraft.

Starting in 2025, Air Canada, in partnership with Bell Canada, will roll out fast and free Wi-Fi to Aeroplan members on Wi-Fi-equipped planes flying within North America, Mexico, and the Caribbean. Air Canada said about 85% of its fleet will be covered. It plans to roll it out to its international fleet starting in 2026.

In the spring of 1987, Air Canada enacted no-smoking flights between Canada and New York City as a test. After a survey reported that 96% of passengers supported the smoking ban, Air Canada extended the ban to other flights.

===Cabin crew===
On 9 February 2017, a new uniform scheme coinciding with Canada&#x27;s 150th and Air Canada&#x27;s 80th anniversaries was unveiled. Air Canada partnered with Vancouver-born fashion designer Christopher Bates to design the new uniforms which incorporate a base colour of black or grey with red lettering and the famous maple leaf.

Between 2004 and 2017, Air Canada uniforms used a midnight blue colour. The uniforms were designed by Canadian fashion designer Debbie Shuchat. At a presentation in the Toronto Airport hangar, Celine Dion helped the newly solvent airline debut its new image.

==Frequent flyer program==

Aeroplan is Air Canada&#x27;s frequent flyer rewards program, both allowing for points collection and spending, as well as status and rewards as an Air Canada customer. After Air Canada and Aeroplan changed the division of points collection and redemption, Air Canada introduced an internal rewards program, Altitude. The two programs operate in conjunction.

In May 2017, Air Canada announced it plans to launch a new loyalty program to replace Aeroplan and Altitude in 2020. On 10 January 2019, Air Canada re-acquired Aeroplan from Aimia. In 2020, Air Canada Altitude and Aeroplan merged, with Aeroplan as the surviving entity.

===Air Canada Altitude===

On 20 September 2012, Air Canada unveiled its new frequent flyer status program named &quot;Air Canada Altitude&quot; to supplement Aeroplan. Aeroplan remained the frequent flyer rewards program, collecting miles which can be &quot;spent&quot;, whereas status level is determined by Altitude standing.

There are five levels of membership in Air Canada&#x27;s Altitude Program: Basic, Prestige 25K, Elite 35K, Elite 50K, Elite 75K and Super Elite 100K. The latter three are called &quot;Top Tier&quot; membership levels and provide travel benefits such as upgrades, lounge access, priority services (e.g., check-in, luggage handling), and bonuses when earning miles through air travel. In order to qualify for these levels, a member must earn, through flight activities, a certain number of miles &quot;or&quot; a certain number of segments &quot;and&quot; spending some level of money. Altitude refers to these as Altitude Qualifying Miles (AQM), Segments (AQS), and Dollars (AQD).

Prestige members and Altitude Elite 35 K receive Star Alliance Silver status, while Elite 50K, Elite 75K, and Super Elite 100K members receive Star Alliance Gold status.

Air Canada Status Miles are calculated on an annual basis to determine Altitude Membership Status for the following benefit year (1 March through 28 February). At the 35K and above levels, that level of status is granted when achieved, for the remainder of the current year, as well as for the next year.

This coincides with the alliance with Star Alliance, and this can give Star Alliance Gold passengers access to any Star Alliance lounge and discounts or upgrades on another Star Alliance member.

On 8 November 2020, Air Canada Altitude renamed as Aeroplan Elite Status. Altitude Qualifying Miles (AQM), Segments (AQS), and Dollars (AQD) have been replaced by Status Qualifying Miles (SQM), Segments (SQS), and Dollars (SQD).

==Accidents and incidents==

==Privacy concerns==
In February 2019, TechCrunch reported that the Air Canada mobile app in the iOS App Store incorporated session-replay software from the Israeli firm Glassbox. This software, without the users&#x27; informed consent, recorded users&#x27; activities and transmitted the data, including unredacted credit card data and passport numbers, to remote servers. This compromised users&#x27; privacy and contravened the rules of the iOS App Store.

<text>Raymond Hart Massey (August 30, 1896 – July 29, 1983) was a Canadian actor, known for his commanding, stage-trained voice. For his lead role in &quot;Abe Lincoln in Illinois&quot; (1940), Massey was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. He reprised his role as Lincoln on television and in &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1962). Among his other well-known roles were Dr. Gillespie in the NBC television series &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot; (1961–1966), John Brown in &quot;Santa Fe Trail&quot; (1940) and &quot;Seven Angry Men&quot; (1955), Abraham Farlan in &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; (1946), and Jonathan Brewster in &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; (1944).

==Early life==
Massey was born in Toronto, Ontario, the son of Anna Vincent, who was American-born, and her husband Chester Daniel Massey, the wealthy co-owner of the Massey-Harris tractor company. He was the grandson of businessman Hart Massey and great-grandson of company founder Daniel Massey. His branch of the Massey family immigrated to Canada from New England a few years before the War of 1812, their ancestors having migrated from England to the Massachusetts colony in the 1630s.

Massey attended secondary school at Upper Canada College in Toronto for two years before transferring to Appleby College in Oakville, Ontario. He also took several courses at the University of Toronto, where he was an active member of the Kappa Alpha Society.

==Military service==
===First World War===
Massey joined the Canadian Army at the outbreak of World War I, and served on the Western Front in the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery. Lieutenant Massey returned to Canada after being wounded at Zillebeke in Belgium during the Battle of Mont Sorrel in 1916 and was engaged as an army instructor for American officers at Yale University. In 1918, he was recalled to active service and joined the Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force that went to Siberia during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. On the orders of his commanding general, he organized a minstrel show troupe with himself as end man in blackface to bolster morale of allied troops on occupation duty in Vladivostok.

After returning home in 1919, he graduated from Balliol College, Oxford. He later went to work in the family business, selling farm implements, but he was drawn to the theater. He persuaded his reluctant family to allow him to pursue this career.

===Second World War===
In 1942, during World War II, Massey rejoined the Canadian Army and served as a major in the adjutant general&#x27;s branch. After being wounded, he was invalided from the Canadian Army in 1943. He became an American citizen in 1944.

==Acting career==
He first appeared on the London stage in 1922 in Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;In the Zone&quot;. According to his obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he appeared in &quot;several dozen plays and directed numerous others&quot; in England over the next decade. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; credited him with performances in over 80 plays, including &quot;Pygmalion&quot; with Gertrude Lawrence; &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; with Ruth Gordon; and the George Bernard Shaw works &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; and &quot;Candida&quot; with Katharine Cornell. In 1929, he directed the London premiere of &quot;The Silver Tassie&quot;. He received poor reviews in his debut on Broadway in an unorthodox 1931 production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

The first movie he was in was &quot;High Treason&quot; (1928). In 1931, he played Sherlock Holmes in &quot;The Speckled Band&quot;, the first sound film version of the story. In 1934, he played the villain in &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;, and in 1936, he starred in &quot;Things to Come&quot;, a film adaptation by H.G. Wells of his own speculative novel &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot; (1933). In 1944, Massey played the district attorney in Fritz Lang&#x27;s classic film noir &quot;The Woman in the Window&quot;, which starred Edward G. Robinson and Joan Bennett. He portrayed the American Revolutionary War character Abraham Farlan, who hated the British for making him a casualty of that war, in the 1946 film &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; (titled &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; in the U.S.).
Despite being Canadian, Massey became famous for playing archetypal American historical figures. He played abolitionist/insurrectionist John Brown in two films: &quot;Santa Fe Trail&quot; (1940) and again in the low-budget &quot;Seven Angry Men&quot; (1955). The character of Brown is a wild-eyed lunatic in &quot;Santa Fe Trail&quot;, whereas he is a well-intentioned but misguided character in the more sympathetic &quot;Seven Angry Men&quot;. Massey scored a great triumph on Broadway in Robert E. Sherwood&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning play &quot;Abe Lincoln in Illinois&quot; despite reservations about Lincoln&#x27;s being portrayed by a Canadian. He repeated his role in the 1940 film version, for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Massey again portrayed Lincoln in &quot;The Day Lincoln Was Shot&quot; on &quot;Ford Star Jubilee&quot; (1956), a silent appearance in &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1962), and two TV adaptations of &quot;Abe Lincoln in Illinois&quot; broadcast in 1950 and 1951. He once complained jokingly that he was &quot;the only actor ever typecast as a president.&quot; His preparation for the role was so detailed and obsessive that one person commented that Massey would not be satisfied with his Lincoln impersonation until someone assassinated him. On stage in a dramatic reading of Stephen Vincent Benét&#x27;s &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; (1953), Massey, in addition to narrating along with Tyrone Power and Judith Anderson, took on the roles of both John Brown and Lincoln.

Massey played a Canadian on-screen only once, in &quot;49th Parallel&quot; (1941).

During World War II, he teamed up with Katharine Cornell and other leading actors in a revival of Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Candida&quot; to benefit the Army Emergency Fund and the Navy Relief Society.

Massey portrayed Jonathan Brewster in the film version of &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot;. The character had been created by Boris Karloff for the stage version, and a running gag in the play and the film was the character&#x27;s resemblance to Karloff. Even though the film was released in 1944, it was shot in 1941, at which time Karloff still was contracted to the Broadway play and could not be released for the filming (unlike his costars Josephine Hull, Jean Adair and John Alexander). Massey and Karloff had appeared together earlier in James Whale&#x27;s suspense film &quot;The Old Dark House&quot; (1932).

After Massey became an American citizen, he continued to work in Hollywood. Memorable film roles included the husband of Joan Crawford during her Oscar-nominated role in &quot;Possessed&quot; (1947) and the doomed publishing tycoon Gail Wynand in &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; (1949) with Patricia Neal and Gary Cooper. In 1952 his stage play &quot;Hanging Judge&quot; appeared in the West End, directed by Michael Powell. In 1955 he starred in &quot;East of Eden&quot; as Adam Trask, father of Cal, played by James Dean, and Aron, played by Richard Davalos.

Massey became well known on television in the 1950s and 1960s. He was cast in 1960 as Sir Oliver Garnett in the episode &quot;Trunk Full of Dreams&quot; of the NBC series &quot;Riverboat&quot;.

Massey is remembered as Dr. Gillespie in the popular 1961–1966 NBC series &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, with Richard Chamberlain in the title role. Massey and his son Daniel were cast as father and son in &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Guards&quot; (1961).

==Personal life==

Massey was married three times.
* Margery Fremantle from 1921 to 1929 (divorce); they had one child, architect Geoffrey Massey.
* Adrianne Allen from 1929 to 1939 (divorce); Allen was a stage actress in London and on Broadway. They had two children who followed them into acting: Anna Massey and Daniel Massey.
* Dorothy Whitney from 1939 until her death in 1982.

His high-profile estrangement and divorce from Adrianne Allen was the inspiration for Ruth Gordon&#x27;s and Garson Kanin&#x27;s script for the film &quot;Adam&#x27;s Rib&quot; (1949), starring Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, and indeed Massey married the lawyer who represented him in court, Dorothy Whitney, while his then former wife, Allen, married the opposing lawyer, William Dwight Whitney.

Massey&#x27;s older brother, Vincent Massey, was the first Canadian-born governor general of Canada. Massey also dabbled in politics, appearing in a 1964 television advertisement in support of the conservative Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater. Massey denounced U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson for a &quot;no-win&quot; strategy in the Vietnam War, suggesting that Goldwater would pursue an aggressive strategy and win the war quickly.

==Death==
Massey died of pneumonia in Los Angeles, California on July 29, 1983, a month before he would have turned 87. His death came on the same day as that of David Niven, with whom he had co-starred in &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; and &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot;. Massey is buried in New Haven, Connecticut&#x27;s Beaverdale Memorial Park.

==Honors==
Massey has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for films at 1719 Vine Street and one for television at 6708 Hollywood Boulevard. His achievements have also been recognized in a signature cocktail, the Raymond Massey.

<text>Master and Commander is a nautical historical novel by the English author Patrick O&#x27;Brian, first published in 1969 in the US and 1970 in the UK. The book proved to be the start of the 20-novel Aubrey–Maturin series, set largely in the era of the Napoleonic Wars, on which O&#x27;Brian continued working until his death in 2000.

The novel is set at the turn of the 19th century. It focuses on two characters: the young Jack Aubrey, a Royal Navy lieutenant who has just been promoted to the rank of Master and Commander, effectively a captain, and Stephen Maturin, a destitute physician and naturalist whom Aubrey appoints as his naval surgeon. They sail in HM sloop-of-war &quot;Sophie&quot; with first lieutenant James Dillon, a wealthy and aristocratic Irishman. The naval action in the Mediterranean is closely based on the real-life exploits of Lord Cochrane, including a battle modelled after Cochrane&#x27;s spectacular victory in the brig HMS &quot;Speedy&quot; over the vastly superior Spanish frigate &quot;El Gamo&quot;.

&quot;Master and Commander&quot; met with mixed reviews on its first publication. Although UK sales were respectable enough for O&#x27;Brian to continue with the series, it was not initially a success in the US. In Britain and Ireland, however, voices of praise gradually became dominant. The novel has been lauded for having &quot;a brilliant sense of period,&quot; and for O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s &quot;easy command of the philosophical, political, sensual and social temper of the times [that] flavors a rich entertainment,&quot; putting the reader into the times in every aspect, from exceptional detail on the practices of the Royal Navy on sailing ships to the states of science, medicine, and society during the Napoleonic era.

In 1990, the US publisher W. W. Norton &amp; Company re-issued the book and its sequels, which was an almost immediate success and drew O&#x27;Brian a new and large readership. O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s biographer has placed the novel at the start of what he called the author&#x27;s magnum opus, a series that has become perhaps the best-loved &quot;roman fleuve&quot; of the 20th century.

==Setting==
The novel opens on 18 April 1800 and covers the period until mid 1801, the action being portrayed within the historical setting of War of the Second Coalition, one phase in Britain’s long and continuing war against the French following Nelson&#x27;s victories in the Mediterranean, including the British victory at the 1798 Battle of the Nile. Events in the novel also largely take place in the Mediterranean, with the French, British, and Spanish navies attempting to capture and disrupt the merchant shipping of their enemies. 

A significant subplot of the novel concerns the divided loyalties of two Irishmen, Dillon and Maturin, following their involvement in the unsuccessful Irish Rebellion of 1798. Ireland was then a country governed by Britain, and political dissent had been increasing for some time. Irish Protestants bemoaned the lack of an effective political voice and the fact that much of the best agricultural land was held by absentee English landlords, while the majority Catholic population was excluded from full participation in politics and the respectable professions. The United Irishmen had been formed in the late 18th century to tackle these grievances, leading ultimately to rebellion. In the rebellion&#x27;s aftermath many disaffected Irishmen (such as Maturin in the novel) had left the island to seek their fortunes elsewhere.

==Plot==
The novel opens in April 1800. Jack Aubrey, a shipless lieutenant wasting away in the Royal Navy port of Mahon in Minorca, meets Stephen Maturin, a destitute Irish-Catalan physician and natural philosopher, at a concert at the Governor&#x27;s Mansion. During the performance, Maturin elbows Aubrey who is beating the measure &quot;half a beat ahead&quot;. The men, both at personal low points, treat the matter as one of honour; they exchange names and anticipate a duel.

Later that evening, Aubrey learns that he has been promoted to the rank of commander and has been given command of the 14-gun HM Sloop &quot;Sophie&quot;. Meeting Maturin in the street the next day, Aubrey&#x27;s joy overcomes his animosity and he invites Maturin to dine. The men discover a shared love of music, Aubrey playing the violin and Maturin the cello. On learning Maturin&#x27;s profession, Aubrey asks him to join his ship. Although as a physician Maturin&#x27;s expertise goes far beyond that normally expected of a naval surgeon, he agrees.

&quot;Sophie&quot; is sent to accompany a small convoy of merchant ships in the Mediterranean. Aubrey takes the opportunity to get to know his sailors and work them into a fighting unit with the aid of his new first lieutenant, James Dillon, a wealthy and aristocratic Irishman. Dillon and Maturin recognize each other, having previously met (a fact they keep to themselves) as members of the United Irishmen, a society dedicated to Irish home rule and Catholic emancipation. Dillon suffers a crisis of conscience when ordered to intercept an American ship thought to be harbouring Irish rebels, and he works to help them avoid capture.

Maturin, who has never been aboard a man-of-war, struggles to understand nautical customs, and the crew explain to him (and to the reader) naval terminology and the official practice whereby prize money can be awarded for captured enemy vessels. Maturin is treated by the crew as a landsman, though without offence. As a natural philosopher he relishes the opportunity to study rare birds and fish.

His convoy duties complete, Aubrey is permitted by Admiral Lord Keith to cruise the Mediterranean independently, looking to capture French and Spanish vessels, at which he is very successful, taking many prizes. &quot;Sophie&quot; meets and defeats the much larger and better-armed &quot;Cacafuego&quot;, a Spanish 32-gun xebec-frigate, though a number of the crew, including Dillon, die in the bloody action. A victory against such odds would normally bring official recognition, promotion, and significant prize money, but unfortunately for Aubrey his superior at Mahon is Captain Harte, with whose wife Aubrey has been having an affair. Harte ensures that Aubrey receives none of those things, though he cannot prevent Aubrey gaining a reputation within the Royal Navy as one of its great, young fighting captains.

On escort duty, &quot;Sophie&quot; is captured by a squadron of four large French warships, and the crew is taken prisoner. The French Captain Christy-Pallière is courteous; he feeds Aubrey well and tells him of his own cousins in Bath. During the crew&#x27;s confinement, the French are attacked by a British squadron in what becomes the First Battle of Algeciras. Several days later the officers are paroled to Gibraltar from where they are able to witness from afar the second battle. Aubrey faces a court-martial for the loss of his ship and is acquitted.

== O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s sources ==

===Background===
In an introductory &quot;Author&#x27;s Note&quot; to the novel, O&#x27;Brian sets out his approach to historical accuracy, noting that historic records of naval battles are filled with &quot;actions that few men could invent&quot;. He goes on to say, &quot;That is why I have gone straight to the source for the fighting in this book ... and so when I describe a fight I have log-books, official letters, contemporary accounts or the participants&#x27; own memoirs to vouch for every exchange ... Yet, on the other hand, I have not felt slavishly bound to precise chronological sequence; ... within a context of general historical accuracy I have changed names, places and minor events&quot;. He considers that &quot;authenticity is a jewel&quot;, and that &quot;the admirable men of these times ... are best celebrated in their own splendid actions rather than in imaginary contests&quot;.

The naval actions of the novel are closely based on the exploits of Thomas Cochrane (1775–1860), 10th Earl of Dundonald, a notoriously fiery naval captain and later admiral. Cochrane&#x27;s own ship, HMS &quot;Speedy&quot;, forms the basis for Aubrey&#x27;s &quot;Sophie&quot;.

Although Aubrey&#x27;s exploits are historically-sourced, his personality is O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s own invention and differs significantly from that of the real Cochrane, a Scot who could at times be rash, confrontational and disagreeable. The character of Maturin is likewise of O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s devising, though it has been said that the author&#x27;s own personality, attitudes, interests and even appearance are closely reflected in his character&#x27;s persona.

===Specific events===
The capture in the novel of the Spanish &quot;Cacafuego&quot; by the vastly inferior &quot;Sophie&quot; is based on the real-life capture on 6 May 1801 of the Spanish frigate &quot;El Gamo&quot; by the British brig-sloop HMS &quot;Speedy&quot;. One of the most spectacular single-ship victories in British Naval history, the &quot;El Gamo&quot; incident captured the public imagination and founded the reputation of the &quot;Speedy&#x27;s&quot; commander, Thomas Cochrane. Like Aubrey in the book, however, Cochrane did not receive from the Admiralty the promotion and prize money he might have expected from so spectacular a victory.

The capture of &quot;Sophie&quot; by Christy-Pallière of the &quot;Desaix&quot; parallels the experience of Cochrane aboard the &quot;Speedy&quot;, down to the detail of the real Christy-Pallière refusing to accept the vanquished captain&#x27;s sword: &quot;I will not accept the sword of an officer who has for so many hours struggled against impossibility&quot;.

The exploit of deceiving a ship at night by attaching lights to a decoy was executed by Cochrane and was described in his &quot;Autobiography of a Seaman&quot;. A similar exploit was reported to have been used by the French privateer Joseph-Marie Potier to escape a British frigate near Quiberon Bay in January 1809.

For the Algeciras Campaign O&#x27;Brian studied the dispatches of admiral Sir James Saumarez along with other contemporary reports of the battle.

==Publication history==
===First US and UK publications 1969 / 70===
In the 1960s two of O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s seafaring books for children, &quot;The Golden Ocean&quot; (1956) and &quot;The Unknown Shore&quot; (1959), caught the attention of a US publisher, J B Lippincott, who were seeking an author to follow in the footsteps of C S Forester, creator of the Hornblower series of novels. Forester had died in 1966 and a year later, at the age of 53, O&#x27;Brian started work on &quot;Master and Commander&quot;. The novel was first published in the US by Lippincott in 1969.

O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s then UK publisher Macmillan, who had originally agreed to jointly commission the book, rejected it as too full of jargon. It was taken up and published by Collins in 1970.

The novel did respectably in Britain (&quot;selling a most surprising number&quot; according to O&#x27;Brian), but was not initially successful in the US. O&#x27;Brian later commented, &quot;I am sorry to say that the Americans did not like it much at its first appearance (they have changed their minds since, bless them)&quot;.

Lippincott persevered in the US with publication of the next two novels in the series, &quot;Post Captain&quot; (1972) and &quot;HMS Surprise&quot; (1973), though sales remained slow. A change of US publisher to Stein and Day for &quot;The Mauritius Command&quot; did not help, and US publications ceased with &quot;Desolation Island&quot; in 1978.

===Norton US reissue 1990===
In 1989 Starling Lawrence, an editor with the US publisher W W Norton, borrowed a copy of &quot;The Reverse of the Medal&quot; from O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s London literary agent to read on his flight home to New York. Lawrence persuaded Norton that in spite of the failed attempts of two previous US publishers &quot;Master and Commander&quot; and the subsequent novels were worth re-publishing. Norton&#x27;s re-issued series (from 1990) was an almost immediate success and drew a new, large readership.

==Literary significance and criticism==
:&quot;This section concentrates on reviews of this specific novel. For more general reviews of the series as a whole, see Aubrey–Maturin series literary significance and criticism&quot;

===First US and UK publications 1969 / 70===
C S Forester having died just a few years earlier, some critics were left bewildered and disappointed by the complexity of O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s creation after the predictability of the Hornblower series. &quot;Not, I think, memorable, at least in the Hornblower way&quot; wrote the &quot;Irish Press&quot;, while according to the &quot;Library Journal&quot;, &quot;Mourning Hornblower fans may prefer to read a good if disappointing new book rather than to reread one of the master&#x27;s epics&quot;.

The reception of other critics was more positive. In the US, The &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; noted the author&#x27;s &quot;delightful subtlety&quot;, and his &quot;easy command of the philosophical, political, sensual and social temper of the times [that] flavors a rich entertainment&quot;, while &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; said that the book was &quot;A welcome treat for sea hounds who care more for belaying pins than ravaged bodices below decks&quot;.

Several UK press reviewers were also impressed. The &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; said &quot;Nothing is glamourised. The press gangings, the squalor are all here...The battle scenes are tremendous...This is not secondhand Forester, but a really fine piece of writing&quot;, while Benedict Nightingale writing in &quot;The Observer&quot; called the book &quot;Dashing, well-timbered, pickled in the period, and with strong human tensions and cross-currents&quot;. According to Tom Pocock in &quot;The Evening Standard,&quot; &quot;It is as though, under Mr O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s touch, those great sea-paintings at Greenwich had stirred and come alive&quot;.

The sailor Sir Francis Chichester, recently returned from his 1967 single-handed voyage round the world, described the book as &quot;the best sea story I have ever read&quot;, a quote which the publishers adopted for use on the novel&#x27;s front cover. Also used on the book&#x27;s jacket in Britain was a heartfelt quote from the author Mary Renault, &quot;A spirited sea-tale with cracking pace and a brilliant sense of period. In a highly competitive field it goes straight to the top. A real first-rater&quot;.

===Later reviews===

As the series of novels expanded, single-volume reviews became less common and reviewers tended to prefer retrospectives of the entire series to date. As one reviewer noted, &quot;The best way to think of these novels is as a single 5,000-page book&quot;.

Although &quot;Master and Commander&quot; and its immediate sequels had received at first a somewhat muted reception in the US, in Britain and Ireland the voices of praise continued to increase and gradually became dominant. By 2000, O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s reputation was such that his American biographer Dean King was able to place &quot;Master and Commander&quot; at the start of what he called the author&#x27;s magnum opus, a twenty-novel series that has become perhaps the best-loved &quot;roman fleuve&quot; of the twentieth century: &quot;[an] epic of two heroic yet believably realistic men that would in some ways define a generation&quot;.

Following O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s death in 2000, Kevin Myers recalled in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; his first reading of this and the subsequent two novels in the series: &quot;the most glorious literary mixture ever – Jane Austen meets Gray&#x27;s Anatomy meets John Buchan meets Apothecaries&#x27; Gazetteer. The author&#x27;s cast of characters is Dickensian in its scope, but of greater subtlety and sophistication in its portrayal.&quot;

According to Richard Snow in 2004, the first meeting between Aubrey and Maturin (with which the novel opens) led to &quot;the greatest friendship of modern literature&quot;. Snow quotes Fredric Smoler, professor of history and literature, in a Shakespearean comparison: &quot;It&#x27;s like Prince Hal meeting Falstaff&quot;.

Writing in 2013, the author Nicola Griffith professed herself smitten: &quot;In these books every reader who loves fiction both intellectually and viscerally will find something to treasure – and every writer something to envy. They will sweep you away and return you delighted, increased and stunned&quot;. She noted that while many reviewers have compared O&#x27;Brian to C S Forester, such comparisons are &#x27;nonsense&#x27; – &quot;This is Jane Austen on a ship of war, with the humanity, joy and pathos of Shakespeare&quot;.

==Film adaptation==
The 2003 Peter Weir film &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot;, starring Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany, uses some of the characters, dialogue and events from the Aubrey–Maturin series, but does not faithfully reproduce the plot of the books.

<text>André Franquin (; 3 January 1924 – 5 January 1997) was an influential Belgian comics artist, whose best-known creations are &quot;Gaston&quot; and &quot;Marsupilami&quot;. He also produced the &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot; comic strip from 1946 to 1968, a period seen by many as the series&#x27; golden age.

==Biography==

===Franquin&#x27;s beginnings===
Franquin was born in Etterbeek in 1924. Although he started drawing at an early age, Franquin got his first actual drawing lessons at &quot;École Saint-Luc&quot; in 1943. A year later, however, the school was forced to close down because of the war and Franquin was then hired by Compagnie belge d&#x27;actualités (CBA), a short-lived animation studio in Brussels. It is there he met some of his future colleagues: Maurice de Bevere (Morris, creator of &quot;Lucky Luke&quot;), Pierre Culliford (Peyo, creator of the &quot;Smurfs&quot;), and Eddy Paape. Three of them (minus Peyo) were hired by Dupuis in 1945, following CBA&#x27;s demise. Peyo, still too young, would only follow them seven years later. Franquin started drawing covers and cartoons for &quot;Le Moustique&quot;, a weekly magazine about radio and culture. He also worked for &quot;Plein Jeu&quot;, a monthly scouting magazine.

During this time, Morris and Franquin were coached by Joseph Gillain (Jijé), who had transformed a section of his house into a workspace for the two young comics artists and Will. Jijé was then producing many of the comics that were published in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine &quot;Spirou&quot;, including its flagship series &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot;. The team he had assembled at the end of the war is often referred to as &quot;La bande des quatre&quot; (lit. &quot;The Gang of Four&quot;), and the graphical style they would develop together was later called the Marcinelle school, Marcinelle being an outskirt of the industrial city of Charleroi south of Brussels where Spirou&#x27;s publisher Dupuis was then situated.

Jijé passed the &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot; strip to Franquin, five pages into the making of &quot;Spirou et la maison préfabriquée&quot;, and from &quot;Spirou&quot; issue #427 released 20 June 1946, the young Franquin held creative responsibility of the series. For the next twenty years, Franquin largely reinvented the strip, creating longer, more elaborate storylines and a large gallery of burlesque characters.

Most notable among these is the Marsupilami, a fictional monkey-like creature. The inspiration for the Marsupilami&#x27;s extremely long, prehensile tail came from imagining an appendage for the busy tramway conductors Franquin and his colleagues often encountered on their way to work. This animal has become part of Belgian and French popular culture and has spawned cartoons, merchandise, and since 1989 a comic book series of its own. The cartoons have broadened their appeal to English-speaking countries.

===Mid period===
By 1951, Franquin had found his style. His strip, that appeared every week on the first page of &quot;Spirou&quot;, was a hit. Following Jijé&#x27;s lead in the 1940s, Franquin coached a younger generation of comics artists in the 1950s, notably Jean Roba and Jidéhem, who both worked with him on &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot;.

In 1955, following a contractual dispute with his publisher Dupuis, Franquin went for a short stint at rival &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine. This led to the creation of &quot;Modeste et Pompon&quot;, a gag series which included contributions from René Goscinny (of &quot;Astérix&quot; fame) and Peyo. Franquin later returned to &quot;Spirou&quot;, but his contractual commitment to &quot;Tintin&quot; meant that he had to contribute to both magazines, an unusual arrangement in the comic industry. The series was later passed on to authors such as Dino Attanasio and Mittéï (Jean Mariette).

In 1957, &quot;Spirou&quot; chief editor Yvan Delporte gave Franquin the idea for a new figure, Gaston Lagaffe (from the French &quot;la gaffe&quot;, meaning &quot;the blunder&quot;). Initially, a joke designed to fill up blank space in the magazine, the weekly strip, detailing the mishaps and madcap ideas and inventions of a terminally idle office boy working at the &quot;Spirou&quot; offices, took off and became one of Franquin&#x27;s best-known creations.

However, Franquin soon suffered a period of depression, which forced him to stop drawing Spirou for a time. This happened between 1961 and 1963, in the middle of &quot;QRN sur Bretzelburg&quot;. During this time, he continued to draw &quot;Gaston&quot; despite his ill health, most likely because of the lighter nature of the series. (In one story, &quot;Bravo Les Brothers&quot;, Gaston&#x27;s antics drive his boss Fantasio to yet another nervous breakdown. In desperation he takes some anti-depressants which &quot;Franquin left behind&quot;.)

In 1967, Franquin passed &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot; on to a younger artist, Jean-Claude Fournier, and began to work full-time on his own creations.

&quot;Gaston&quot; gradually evolved from pure slapstick humor to feature themes important to Franquin, such as pacifism and environmentalism. Franquin also used its characters in paid ad strips he drew and worked with the strip on and off until his death.

===Franquin&#x27;s later period===
The 1960s saw a clear evolution in Franquin&#x27;s style, which grew more loose and intricate. This graphical evolution would continue throughout the next decade. Soon, Franquin was considered an undisputed master of the art form, on par with the likes of Hergé and his influence can be seen in the work of nearly every cartoonist hired by &quot;Spirou&quot; up until the end of the 1990s. Early comic fanzines from around 1970 featured Franquin&#x27;s &quot;Monsters&quot;, individual drawings of imaginary beasts highlighting his graphical craftmanship.

The last, and most radical, shift in Franquin&#x27;s production happened in 1977, when he went through another nervous breakdown and began his &quot;Idées Noires&quot; strip (lit. &quot;Dark Thoughts&quot;), first for the &quot;Spirou&quot; supplement, &quot;Le Trombone Illustré&quot; (with other cartoonists like René Follet) and later for &quot;Fluide Glacial&quot;. With &quot;Idées Noires&quot;, Franquin showed the darker, pessimistic side of his nature. In one strip, a pair of flies are seen wandering through a strange landscape, discussing the mistakes of their predecessors. In the final panel, we see the landscape is a city made from human skulls, and one fly responds: &quot;Don&#x27;t be too hard on them, they did leave us such splendid cities&quot;. Drawn entirely in black and white, &quot;Idées Noires&quot; is much more adult-oriented than Franquin&#x27;s other works, focusing on themes such as death, war, pollution, and capital punishment with a devastatingly sarcastic sense of humour.

From 1978 to 1986, he was part of the team that developed the concept of &quot;Isabelle&quot;, the adventures of a little girl in a world of witches and monsters. The character was named after Franquin&#x27;s daughter.

Proof of his popular and critical appeal, Franquin was awarded the very first Grand Prix de la ville d&#x27;Angoulême in 1974. Many books by Franquin have been published, many of which are considered classics of the genre. They have been translated into many languages. Several books have been written about Franquin, such as Numa Sadoul&#x27;s &quot;Et Franquin créa la gaffe&quot;, an exhaustive interview with the artist covering his entire career.

Franquin died in 1997 in Saint-Laurent-du-Var at the age of 73 from a heart attack. He was previously married to Liliane Servais. In 2004 took place the first major museum retrospective of his work, an exhibit called &quot;Le monde de Franquin&quot;&#x27;, in Paris&#x27; Cité des Sciences et de l&#x27;Industrie. This exhibition was continued in 2006 in the city where he was born, Brussels, the latter was fully bilingual (French/Dutch). In 2005, a Walloon survey elected him as the &quot;18th greatest Belgian ever&quot;.

==Influence==
Franquin&#x27;s style rests in opposite corners of the aesthetic spectrum from Hergé: If the pictures of Tintin&#x27;s creator were characterized by the use of ligne claire, flat colors, and certain statics, Franquin&#x27;s graphic approach progressively evolved towards a multi-color aesthetics, chiaroscuro and a vigorous sense of movement. Hergé expressed on several occasions his admiration for Franquin&#x27;s work: &quot;Compared to him, I’m but a poor draftsman&quot;.

Franquin was a prominent member of the first generation of the “Marcinelle School” (École de Marcinelle), also formed by Morris and Will, who would be joined during the 50s by the second generation including, among others, Peyo, Tillieux, and two subsequent generations joining during the 60s and 70-80s. Within this group, Franquin&#x27;s influence was uncontested, especially among the authors that continued the series Spirou et Fantasio after he left. Jean-Claude Fournier, Nic Broca, and especially Janry (Jean-Richard Geurts) showed in this series graphic styles that tried to mimic with varying degrees of success the features of Franquin&#x27;s style.

Other Franco-Belgian authors that show Franquin&#x27;s influence were Dino Attanasio and Mittéï (Jean Mariette), both responsible for the series &quot;Modeste et Pompon&quot; after he left, Jidéhem (Jean De Mesmaeker), a usual collaborator of Franquin for Spirou et Fantasio and Gaston Lagaffe, Batem (Luc Collin), artist of the Marsupilami series, or Pierre Seron, who cloned Franquin&#x27;s style in his series &quot;Les Petits Hommes&quot;.

A most remarkable case is Franquin&#x27;s influence on Francisco Ibáñez, possibly the most widely published Spanish author since the 1950s. Starting in the 1970s, Ibáñez made extensive use of ideas and designs from Franquin&#x27;s works, adapting them to his own universe, but also importing many graphic and narrative solutions. Even one of his characters, &quot;El Botones Sacarino&quot;, can be easily identified as a hybrid of Spirou (he is a bellboy) and Gaston Lagaffe (he works in a publishing company and is the source of never-ending disasters), whom he resembles physically. Franquin&#x27;s shadow is even more obvious in the work of Ramón María Casanyes, a disciple and ghost collaborator of Ibáñez, especially in some of his solo works such as the short-lived &quot;Tito, Homo Sapiens 2000&quot;, where the Franco-Belgian descent is unquestionable.

<doc id="145629" wikidata="Q318169" url="?curid=145629" title="Abe Lincoln in Illinois (film)">
<text>Abe Lincoln in Illinois is a 1940 biographical-drama film that depicts the life of Abraham Lincoln from his departure from Kentucky until his election as president of the United States. In the UK, the film is known by the alternate title Spirit of the People. The film was adapted by Grover Jones and Robert E. Sherwood from Sherwood&#x27;s 1938 Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name. It was directed by John Cromwell.

The film stars Raymond Massey and Howard da Silva, who reprised their roles from the original Broadway production of &quot;Abe Lincoln in Illinois&quot;, playing Abe Lincoln and Jack Armstrong respectively. Herbert Rudley, who had portrayed Seth Gale in the play, also repeated his role in the film version. The film also marks the screen debut of Ruth Gordon in the role of Mary Todd Lincoln.

The film received Academy Award nominations for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Raymond Massey) and Best Cinematography, Black-and-White (James Wong Howe).

==Plot==
Abraham Lincoln leaves home for the first time, having been hired along with two of his friends by Denton Offutt to take a load of pigs by water to New Orleans. When the boat becomes stuck at a dam at the settlement of New Salem, Abe sees and loses his heart to Ann Rutledge, the daughter of the local tavern keeper. When Denton later offers him a job at his store in New Salem, Abe readily accepts.

Abe discovers that Ann already has a beau. However, he makes himself the most popular man in town with his ready, good-natured humor. He takes lessons from schoolteacher Mentor Graham. When Abe&#x27;s rival for Ann&#x27;s affections leaves to improve himself, Ann waits for the man for two years before receiving a letter stating that the man does not know when he will return. Abe seizes the opportunity to express his love for Ann, but she is unsure of her feelings for him and asks for some time. She soon dies from &quot;brain fever&quot;, telling Abe on her deathbed that she could have loved him.

Abe is asked to run for the Illinois General Assembly. He reluctantly accepts and wins, but after his first term in Springfield, he decides to study the law. When Mary Todd visits her sister Elizabeth Edwards and her wealthy, influential husband Ninian, a party is held in her honor. All of the eligible bachelors come, including Stephen Douglas, Abe&#x27;s fiercest political rival. However, it is the homely, unpolished Abe who catches Mary&#x27;s fancy, much to her sister&#x27;s chagrin. Ambitious, Mary senses greatness in him, and she is determined to drive him to his rightful destiny despite his lack of ambition. Abe proposes marriage but changes his mind at the last minute, discomfited by her drive, and he leaves town. After reflection, he proposes again, and Mary accepts. Years pass, and they have several children.

Lincoln runs for a seat in the U.S, Senate and engages in a series of debates with Stephen Douglas, the opposing candidate, during which the main issue is slavery. In a stirring speech, Abe contends that &quot;a house divided against itself cannot stand.&quot;

With a presidential election looming, Abe&#x27;s party is so split that the favorites are unacceptable to all. The party leaders compromise on dark-horse candidate Lincoln. He is opposed by three other candidates, including Douglas. Abe wins the election, bids his friends goodbye and boards the train for Washington, D.C.

==Cast==
==Production==
RKO paid &quot;upwards of $175,000&quot; for the play&#x27;s film rights. Filming took place in Eugene, Oregon.

==Reception==
In a contemporary review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Frank S. Nugent called the film &quot;a grand picture and a memorable biography of the greatest American of them all&quot; and praised Massey&#x27;s performance: &quot;His Lincoln has acquired, with constant usage of the role, a mellowness, an evenness, an assurance that make the character seem less put on than foreordained by nature and by art. He looks the part, he is the man, he speaks the lines as Lincoln must have spoken them, or should have spoken them. We recognize that it is unfair to take performance for granted, but that will be Mr. Massey&#x27;s fate: you will simply think of him as Lincoln.&quot;

The film recorded a loss of $740,000, making it one of the greatest financial disasters in RKO&#x27;s history. However, in the states of Illinois and Indiana, where the film was heavily promoted, it became the highest-grossing film in most theaters. Nationwide, it lost attendance to a number of successful films such as &quot;Rebecca&quot;, &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot;, &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, &quot;Fantasia&quot;, &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot;, &quot;Our Town&quot;, &quot;Santa Fe Trail&quot;, &quot;The Letter&quot;, &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; and &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.

==Adaptations to other media==
&quot;Abe Lincoln in Illinois&quot; was dramatized as an hour-long radio play on a broadcast of &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot; on April 22, 1940, again starring Raymond Massey as Lincoln. It also was adapted in a broadcast from the Ford Theatre on February 8, 1948.

<doc id="145630" wikidata="Q336251" url="?curid=145630" title="GNOME Evolution">
<text>GNOME Evolution (formerly Novell Evolution and Ximian Evolution, prior to Novell&#x27;s 2003 acquisition of Ximian) is the official personal information manager for GNOME. It has been an official part of GNOME since Evolution 2.0 was included with the GNOME 2.8 release in September 2004. It combines e-mail, address book, calendar, task list and note-taking features. Its user interface and functionality is similar to Microsoft Outlook. Evolution is free software licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

==Features==
Evolution delivers the following features:
* E-mail retrieval with the POP and IMAP protocols and e-mail transmission with SMTP
* Secure network connections encrypted with SSL, TLS and STARTTLS
* E-mail encryption with GPG and S/MIME
* Markdown e-mail formatting
* E-mail filters
* Search folders: saved searches that look like normal mail folders as an alternative to using filters and search queries
* Automatic spam filtering with SpamAssassin and Bogofilter
* Connectivity to Microsoft Exchange Server, Novell GroupWise and Kolab (provided in separate packages as plug-ins)
* Calendar support for the iCalendar file format, the WebDAV and CalDAV standards and Google Calendar
* Contact management with local address books, CardDAV, LDAP and Google address books
* Synchronization via SyncML with SyncEvolution and with Palm OS devices via gnome-pilot
* Address books that can be used as a data source in LibreOffice
* User avatars loading from address book, e-mail headers X-Face, Face or automatic lookup by hashed e-mail address from Gravatar service
* An RSS reader plug-in
* A news client
* Import from Microsoft Outlook archives (dbx, pst) and Berkeley Mailbox
The Novell GroupWise plug-in is no longer in active development. A Scalix plug-in is also available, but its development stopped in 2009.

=== Evolution Data Server ===
Evolution Data Server (EDS) is a collection of libraries and session services for storing address books and calendars. Other software such as California and GNOME Calendar depends on EDS as well.

Some documentation about the software architecture is available in the GNOME wiki.

===Connecting to Microsoft Exchange Server===
Depending on which version of Microsoft Exchange Server is used, different packages need to be installed to be able to connect to it. The documentation recommends the &quot;evolution-ews&quot; package (which uses Exchange Web Services) for Exchange Server 2007, 2010 and newer. If &quot;evolution-ews&quot; does not work well, it is advised to try the &quot;evolution-mapi&quot; package. This supports Exchange Server 2010, 2007 and possibly older versions supporting MAPI. For Exchange Server 2003, 2000 and possibly earlier versions supporting Outlook Web App the package &quot;evolution-exchange&quot; is recommended.

==History==
Ximian decided to develop Evolution in 2000. It felt there were no e-mail clients for Linux at the time that could provide the functionality and interoperability necessary for corporate users. Ximian saw an opportunity for Linux to penetrate the corporate environment if the right enterprise software was available for it. It released Evolution 1.0 in December 2001 and offered the paid Ximian Connector plug-in which allowed users to connect with Microsoft Exchange Server. Evolution itself has been free software from the start, but Ximian Connector was sold as proprietary software so that Ximian could generate revenue. This changed after Novell&#x27;s acquisition of Ximian in August 2003. Novell decided to integrate the Exchange plug-in as free software in Evolution 2.0 in May 2004.

Novell was in turn acquired by The Attachmate Group in 2011. It transferred Novell&#x27;s former Evolution developers to its subsidiary SUSE. In 2012 SUSE decided to stop its funding of Evolution&#x27;s development and assigned its developers elsewhere. As a consequence only two full-time developers employed by Red Hat remained. Later in 2013 Red Hat dedicated more developers to the project, reinvigorating its development. The reasons given for the decision were the cessation of active development on Mozilla Thunderbird and the need for an e-mail client with good support for Microsoft Exchange.

==Distribution==
As a part of GNOME, Evolution is released as source code. Linux distributions provide packages of GNOME for end-users. Evolution is used as the default personal information manager on several Linux distributions which use GNOME by default, most notably Debian and Fedora. Ubuntu has replaced Evolution with Mozilla Thunderbird as the default e-mail client since Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot.

===Defunct Mac OS X and Windows ports===
In the past, Evolution was ported to Apple Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows, but these ports are no longer developed.

In 2006, Novell released an installer for Evolution 2.6 on Mac OS X. In January 2005, Novell&#x27;s Nat Friedman announced in his blog that the company had hired Tor Lillqvist, the programmer who ported GIMP to Microsoft Windows, to do the same with Evolution. Prior to this announcement, several projects with the same goal had been started but none of them reached alpha status. In 2008 DIP Consultants released a Windows installer for Evolution 2.28.1-1 for Microsoft Windows XP and newer. Currently it is only available for download from the project&#x27;s page on SourceForge.

A slightly more recent (2010/2011) experimental installer for Evolution 3.0.2 is provided by openSUSE. Users have faced difficulties getting this version working.

<text>Penny Serenade is a 1941 American melodrama film directed by George Stevens starring Irene Dunne and Cary Grant as a loving couple who must overcome adversity to keep their marriage and raise a child. It was produced and distributed by Columbia Pictures. Grant was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance.

==Plot==

The film charts the meeting, courtship and marriage of Julie Gardiner (Irene Dunne) and Roger Adams (Cary Grant) through the playing of popular songs relevant to each time period. After their spur-of-the-moment marriage on New Year&#x27;s Eve and a night in Roger&#x27;s train compartment en route to San Francisco, a pregnant Julie rejoins Roger in Tokyo, where he has a stint as a reporter. Julie loses their unborn child in the 1923 Tokyo earthquake and returns with Roger to California. They are despondent until their friend Applejack Carney (Edgar Buchanan) encourages them to adopt a child. While Roger struggles to keep a newspaper going in the fictional California town of Rosalia, Julie keeps house and fits out the nursery.

They apply at an adoption agency for a two-year-old boy, and receive a call from Miss Oliver (Beulah Bondi) that a five-week-old baby girl is available. Though Roger would have preferred a boy, he falls in love with the baby, and he and Julie care for her during their one-year probation period. At the end of that time, Roger has lost the newspaper, and the law prevents him from adopting the baby without an income. Roger appears before the judge and delivers an impassioned plea to keep the child, whom he considers his own. The judge awards custody, and Roger returns home to Julie with their daughter.

Years later, Roger and Julie swell with pride as their daughter, Trina, not yet old enough to play an angel in the Christmas play, plays the &quot;echo&quot; instead. The following Christmas, Julie writes to Miss Oliver that Trina has died from a sudden illness. The child&#x27;s death sends Roger into a deep depression, and Julie resolves to leave him, believing he no longer needs her. Just as she is about to leave for the train station, the couple receive a phone call from Miss Oliver, saying that a two-year-old boy has just become available for adoption. Roger and Julie embrace, ready to rebuild their marriage with a new child.

==Production==
===Development=== 
For $25,000, Columbia Pictures purchased the rights to a story by Martha Cheavens published in &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; and engaged Cheavens as script consultant. Morrie Ryskind was credited for the screenplay.

The film depicts the passage of time through the playing of songs. According to George Stevens&#x27; papers stored at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences library, Stevens kept close track of the chronology of the songs to accurately match them to the different time periods in the script. These songs include &quot;The Japanese Sandman&quot;, &quot;These Foolish Things&quot;, &quot;Just a Memory&quot;, &quot;Three O&#x27;Clock in the Morning&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t We Got Fun&quot;, and &quot;The Prisoner&#x27;s Song&quot;.

===Casting===
&quot;Penny Serenade&quot; is the third of three films pairing Grant and Dunne, each time playing a married couple.

At the time, California law restricted the time an infant could be present in a film studio to two hours per day; during that time, the infant could be kept on a sound stage for only one hour, and be filmed under the studio lights for only twenty minutes at a time. To double the amount of time he could film the character of Trina both as a baby and as a one-year-old, Stevens hired identical twin girls for Trina at each age. The baby was played by Judith and Dianna Fleetwood, and the one-year-old by Joan and Jane Biffle.

===Filming===
Filming took place from October 14, 1940 to January 15, 1941.

==Release==
The film was released on April 24, 1941.

==Critical reception==

On the film review website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Penny Serenade&quot; receives a &quot;Fresh&quot; rating with 93% (16 of 17) of its T-meter critics reviewed the film positively. &quot;Variety&quot; commended both the direction and the acting for lifting the script out of maudlin melodrama. Describing the plot elements as &quot;tenderness, heart-throb, comedy and good, old-fashioned, gulping tears&quot;, the review notes: &quot;Half a dozen times the yarn approaches the saccharine, only to be turned back into sound, human comedy-drama&quot;. A &quot;Time&quot; review also lauded Stevens&#x27; direction, stating: &quot;Grant and Dunne cannot overcome the ten-little-fingers-and-ten-little-toes plot ... it is too often a moving picture which does not move. Skillful direction saves it from turning maudlin&quot;. &quot;Radio Times&quot; said that Grant &quot;gives a lesson in screen acting and was rightly Oscar-nominated for a superb, subtly-shaded portrayal that keeps sentimentality at bay&quot;.

When the movie premiered at the Radio City Music Hall, Bosley Crowther, in a somewhat ambivalent review, concludes &quot;[there is] some very credible acting on the part of Mr. Grant and Miss Dunne is responsible in the main for the infectious quality of the film. Edgar Buchanan, too, gives an excellent performance as a good-old-Charlie friend, and Beulah Bondi is sensible as an orphanage matron. Heart-warming is the word for both of them. As a matter of fact, the whole picture deliberately cozies up to the heart. Noël Coward once dryly observed how extraordinarily potent cheap music is. That is certainly true of &quot;Penny Serenade&quot;&quot;.

Grant considered his role in &quot;Penny Serenade&quot; as his best performance. Dunne often remarked that this was her favorite film &quot;because it reminded her of her own adopted daughter&quot;.

==Accolades==
Grant was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance. He lost to Gary Cooper&#x27;s portrayal of &quot;Sergeant York&quot; at the 14th Academy Awards.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Penny Serenade&quot; was dramatized as a half-hour radio play on the November 16, 1941, broadcast of &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot;, starring Cary Grant and Irene Dunne in their original roles. It was also presented as an hour-long drama on &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot;, first on April 27, 1942, with Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck, and then on May 8, 1944, starring Joseph Cotten and Irene Dunne. Dunne again starred in July 1953 on CBS Radio&#x27;s &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;.
A television adaptation for &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;, starring Phyllis Thaxter and Don Taylor, was broadcast on January 13, 1955, on NBC.

==Copyright status and home media==
The copyright on &quot;Penny Serenade&quot; was not renewed when its initial 28-year term expired and it entered the public domain in 1970. Subsequently, the film has seen many releases by budget labels on various home video formats, but all are of very poor quality and most, but not all, are missing a pivotal five-minute scene in which Grant pleads with a judge to be allowed to adopt despite the failure of his newspaper.

The original elements are now with Paramount Global (under Paramount Pictures), via the company&#x27;s former Republic Pictures library. Using these elements, &quot;Penny Serenade&quot; has been released uncut and in high quality on Blu-ray and DVD in the US (Olive Films, 2013) and Germany (Alive, 2017).

==In popular culture==
The main character in Ang Lee&#x27;s &quot;Lust, Caution&quot; (2007) watches &quot;Penny Serenade&quot; in a Shanghai movie theater showing Western films.

In the film &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; (1991), state police and FBI personnel watch &quot;Penny Serenade&quot; on late-night television while monitoring a phone tap at Thelma&#x27;s home in Arkansas. (Only the film&#x27;s audio is briefly heard.)

In The Sopranos episode &quot;The Weight&quot; (2002), Ginny Sacrimoni claims to be up late because &quot;Penny Serenade&quot; was on AMC, when in fact she was weighing herself.

<doc id="145636" wikidata="Q7729994" url="?curid=145636" title="The Devil and Daniel Webster">
<text>&quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; (1936) is a short story by American writer Stephen Vincent Benét. He tells of a New Hampshire farmer who sells his soul to the devil and is later defended by a fictionalized Daniel Webster, a noted 19th-century American statesman, lawyer and orator. The narrative references real events in the lives of Webster and his family.

The story appeared in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; (October 24, 1936) and was published in book form by Farrar &amp; Rinehart the following year. The story won the O. Henry Award. The author also adapted it in 1938 as a folk opera, with music by Douglas Stuart Moore, a fellow Yale University alumnus.

==Plot summary==
Farmer Jabez Stone, from the small town of Cross Corners, New Hampshire, is plagued with unending bad luck. He finally says, &quot;it&#x27;s enough to make a man want to sell his soul to the devil!&quot; The next day, he is visited by a stranger, identified as &quot;Mr. Scratch&quot;, who offers to give him seven years of prosperity in exchange for his soul. Stone agrees.

Mr. Scratch comes for Stone&#x27;s soul at the appointed time, and Stone bargains for more years. After that, Scratch refuses an extension. Stone hires noted lawyer and orator Daniel Webster to get him out of the deal.

At midnight of the appointed date, Mr. Scratch and Webster begin their legal argument. It goes poorly for Webster, since Stone&#x27;s signature and the contract are clear, and Mr. Scratch will not compromise.

Webster says: &quot;Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince. We fought England for that in &#x27;12 and we&#x27;ll fight all hell for it again!&quot; To this Mr. Scratch insists on his own citizenship, citing his presence at the worst events in the history of the U.S., concluding, &quot;though I don&#x27;t like to boast of it, my name is older in this country than yours&quot;.

Webster demands a trial as the right of every American. Mr. Scratch agrees after Webster says that he can select the judge and jury, &quot;so long as it is an American judge and an American jury&quot;. A jury of the damned enters, &quot;with the fires of hell still upon them&quot;. They had all done evil, and had all played a part in the formation of the United States:

*Walter Butler, a Loyalist
*Simon Girty, a Loyalist
*King Philip, sachem of the Wampanoag people, who fought against the English
*Governor of Virginia Thomas Dale, known for his high-handed administration
*Thomas Morton, a rival of the Plymouth Pilgrims
*Pirate Edward Teach, also known as Blackbeard
*Reverend John Smeet (fictional character)

After five other unnamed jurors enter (Benedict Arnold being out &quot;on other business&quot;), the judge enters last. It is John Hathorne, who presided at the Salem witch trials.

The trial is rigged against Webster. He is outraged but calms himself, thinking &quot;for it was him they&#x27;d come for, not only Jabez Stone&quot;.

Webster starts to orate on simple and good things – &quot;the freshness of a fine morning...the taste of food when you&#x27;re hungry...the new day that&#x27;s every day when you&#x27;re a child&quot; – and how &quot;without freedom, they sickened&quot;. He speaks passionately of how wonderful it is to be human and to be an American. He admits the wrongs done in the course of American history but points out that something new and good had grown from them and that &quot;everybody had played a part in it, even the traitors&quot;. Humankind &quot;got tricked and trapped and bamboozled, but it was a great journey&quot;, something &quot;no demon that was ever foaled&quot; could ever understand.

The jury announces its verdict: &quot;We find for the defendant, Jabez Stone.&quot; They admit, &quot;Perhaps &#x27;tis not strictly in accordance with the evidence, but even the damned may salute the eloquence of Mr. Webster.&quot; The judge and jury disappear with the break of dawn. Mr. Scratch congratulates Webster, and the contract is torn up. The devil has overreached himself, agreeing to a jury trial out of pride in his unbreakable contract. But by doing so, he has put his contract within the reach of the Common Law used in the United States, under which a jury can enter whatever verdict it likes, regardless of the law. Webster&#x27;s eloquence in swaying this supposedly unswayable jury is remarkable, but would have gone to no effect without the devil&#x27;s pride-induced mistake in giving Webster a chance.

Webster then grabs the stranger/Satan and twists his arm behind his back, &quot;for he knew that once you bested anybody like Mr. Scratch in fair fight, his power on you was gone.&quot; Webster makes him agree &quot;never to bother Jabez Stone nor his heirs or assigns nor any other New Hampshire man till doomsday!&quot;

Mr. Scratch offers to tell Webster&#x27;s fortune in his palm. He foretells (actual) events in Webster&#x27;s future, including his failure to become President (an actual ambition of his), the death of Webster&#x27;s sons (which happened in the American Civil War) and the backlash of his last speech, warning &quot;Some will call you Ichabod&quot; (as in John Greenleaf Whittier&#x27;s poem in reaction to Webster&#x27;s controversial Seventh of March speech supporting the Compromise of 1850 that incorporated the Fugitive Slave Act, with many in the North calling Webster a traitor).

Webster asks only if the Union will prevail. Scratch admits that the United States will remain united after the war. Webster then laughs, &quot;... and with that he drew back his foot for a kick that would have stunned a horse. It was only the tip of his shoe that caught the stranger, but he went flying out of the door with his collecting box under his arm ... And he hasn&#x27;t been seen in the state of New Hampshire from that day to this.&quot;

==Major themes==

=== Patriotism ===
Patriotism is a main theme in the story: Webster claims that the Devil cannot take the soul because he cannot claim American citizenship. &quot;And who with better right?&quot; the devil replies, going on to list several wrongs done in the U.S., thereby demonstrating his presence in the U.S.. The devil says &quot;I am merely an honest American like yourself – and of the best descent – for, to tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don&#x27;t like to boast of it, my name is older in this country than yours.&quot;

Webster insists on a jury trial as an American right, with Americans for the jury and an American judge. The devil then provides the worst from Webster&#x27;s perspective (and certainly, they are in Hell) examples of Americans for the judge and jury. In Daniel&#x27;s speech &quot;He was talking about the things that make a country a country, and a man a man&quot; rather than legal points of the case. For Webster, freedom and independence defines manhood: &quot;Yes, even in hell, if a man was a man, you&#x27;d know it.&quot;

This theme of American patriotism, freedom and independence is the explanation for Webster&#x27;s victory: the jury is damned to hell, but they are American and therefore so independent that they can resist the devil. However, in reality many of the jury would not have classed themselves as Americans, as Governor Dale, Morton, Hathorne, and Blackbeard were English, and King Phillip was a Wampanoag. Butler and Girty would have called themselves Americans – and indeed were Americans – but they were Loyalists, and Webster might not have intended any but U.S. citizens. Classifying the jurors as &quot;Americans&quot; involves a wider definition, including all who had a part in its history – even those who lived and died as English subjects before 1775, the Loyalists who actively opposed the creation of the U.S., and those Indians (like King Philip) who interacted with the new civilization. Scratch underlines this definition by saying of the jury &quot;Americans all&quot;.

===Slavery===
In his speech, Webster denounces slavery. Earlier, he states flatly: &quot;A man is not a piece of property.&quot; Later, there is this description: &quot;And when he talked of those enslaved, and the sorrows of slavery, his voice got like a big bell.&quot; Benét acknowledges the evil by having the devil say: &quot;When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on her deck.&quot; As for Webster, &quot;He admitted all the wrong that had ever been done. But he showed how, out of the wrong and the right, the suffering and the starvations, something new had come. And everybody had played a part in it, even the traitors.&quot;

The real Daniel Webster was willing to compromise on slavery in favor of keeping the Union together, disappointing some radical abolitionists, but he held that only the preservation of the Union could keep anti-slavery forces active in the slave areas. This desire to end the institution was a mainspring of his support for the Union.

===Treatment of aboriginal Americans===
The story may be seen as sympathetic to the plight of the aboriginal Americans. Webster states &quot;If two New Hampshiremen aren&#x27;t a match for the devil, we might as well give the country back to the Indians.&quot; The stranger/Satan remarks that &quot;When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there,&quot; which implies the author&#x27;s acknowledgement that aboriginal Americans were sometimes wronged. &quot;King Philip, wild and proud as he had been in life, with the great gash in his head that gave him his death wound&quot; is noted as a notorious villain of American history (the historical King Philip (Metacomet), died from a gunshot to the heart, not a gash to the head).

Yet later on, Daniel Webster&#x27;s appeal to the jury on &quot;what it means to be American&quot; specifically includes King Philip among &quot;the Americans.&quot; This is an anachronism, as the historical Daniel Webster would have been unlikely to express such an opinion. The narrator also expresses sympathy for King Philip when he tells us that one juror &quot;heard the cry of his lost nation&quot; in Webster&#x27;s eloquent appeal.

===The devil===
The devil is portrayed as polite and refined. When the devil arrives he is described as &quot;a soft-spoken, dark-dressed stranger,&quot; who &quot;drove up in a handsome buggy.&quot; The names Benét gives the devil – &quot;Mr. Scratch&quot; or &quot;the stranger&quot; – were both used around New England and other parts of the pre-Civil War United States: &quot;Perhaps Scratch will do for the evening. I&#x27;m often called that in these regions.&quot; These terms are taken primarily from &quot;The Devil and Tom Walker&quot; (1824) by Washington Irving, who usually calls the devil &quot;Old Scratch&quot;.

==Adaptations==

=== Screen ===
Two film adaptations have been made:

An Academy Award-winning 1941 film first released under the title &quot;All That Money Can Buy&quot;, starring Edward Arnold as Daniel, Walter Huston as Mr. Scratch, James Craig as Jabez Stone, and Simone Simon as Belle.

&quot;Shortcut to Happiness&quot; is a modernized version set in the publishing world, starring Anthony Hopkins as a publisher named Daniel Webster, Alec Baldwin as a best-selling (via the devil) but terrible author named Jabez Stone, and Jennifer Love Hewitt as a female version of the devil. This version was made in 2001, but was halted before completion, before finally being completed and given a limited release in 2007.

An animated TV film loosely based on the story, &quot;The Devil and Daniel Mouse&quot;, was released in 1978.

Phil Reisman, Jr. adapted the story for a live televised performance of &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; on the &quot;Breck Sunday Showcase&quot; (NBC, February 14, 1960, 60 min), starring Edward G. Robinson (Daniel Webster), David Wayne (Mr. Scratch), and Tim O&#x27;Connor (Jabez Stone). A color videorecording of the production aired two years later on &quot;Breck Golden Showcase&quot; (CBS, April 30, 1962).

=== Radio ===
&quot;Each of these adaptations used the original story title, unless otherwise indicated:&quot;

Charles R. Jackson&#x27;s adaptation aired on &quot;Columbia Workshop&quot; (CBS, Aug. 6, 1938, 30 min), with music by Bernard Herrmann.

Edward Arnold, Walter Huston, and James Craig reprised their 1941 film roles in the &quot;All That Money Can Buy&quot; episode of &quot;Cavalcade of America&quot; (NBC Red Network, October 20, 1941, 30 min). Howard Teichmann and Robert L. Richards abridged and adapted the screenplay.

Jean Holloway&#x27;s adaptation aired on &quot;Hallmark Playhouse&quot; (CBS, June 10, 1948, 30 min); cast: John McIntire (Daniel Webster), Alan Reed (Mr. Scratch), Frank Goss (Jabez Stone).

Edward Arnold again played Daniel Webster for the &quot;Prudential Family Hour of Stars&quot; (CBS, Sept. 18, 1949, 30 min).

Walter Huston again reprised his 1941 film role in the &quot;All That Money Can Buy&quot; episode of &quot;Theatre Guild on the Air&quot; (NBC, April 30, 1950, 60 min); Cornel Wilde and Martha Scott co-starred.

=== Stage ===
Benét adapted his story as a play, &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster: A Play in One Act&quot; (New York: Dramatists Play Service, 1938), and also as a folk opera, &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster: An Opera in One Act&quot; (New York: Farrar &amp; Rinehart, 1939), music by Douglas Moore (Moore and Benét had earlier collaborated on an operetta, &quot;The Headless Horseman&quot; [1937], based on Washington Irving&#x27;s short story &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; [1820]).

Archibald MacLeish, a friend and associate of Benét&#x27;s in the 1930s and until his death in 1943, also adapted the story as a play: &quot;Scratch&quot; (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1971). On Broadway very briefly, &quot;Scratch&quot; starred Will Geer in the title role and Patrick Magee as Webster. Originally conceived as a musical collaboration with Bob Dylan, the collaboration fell apart due to creative differences between Dylan and MacLeish. The show opened at Broadway&#x27;s St. James Theater on May 6, 1971, and closed two days later.

==In popular culture==
*In Treehouse of Horror IV of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in &quot;The Devil and Homer Simpson&quot;, Homer Simpson announces he would sell his soul for a doughnut, and the devil, who resembles Ned Flanders, appears to make a deal with Homer. Homer tries to outsmart the devil by not finishing the doughnut, but eventually eats it and is sent to Hell; there he is &quot;tormented&quot; by being forced to eat thousands of doughnuts, an ironic punishment that backfires when he gleefully eats them without any sign of pain. A trial is held between Homer and the devil to determine the rightful owner of Homer&#x27;s soul. Marge Simpson saves Homer&#x27;s soul when she reveals that Homer gave her ownership of it, meaning that it was not in his possession when the deal was made.
* In an episode of the 1960s TV series &quot;The Monkees&quot;, this story was also presented in &quot;The Devil and Peter Tork&quot;, wherein Peter finds a beautiful harp in a pawn shop run by Mr. Zero and says that he would give anything for it. Mr. Zero then has Peter sign a contract which condemns him by promising his soul to Mr. Zero. The boys become an overnight success after adding the harp to their act. They learn what has happened when Mr. Zero comes to collect Peter&#x27;s soul and Mike argues that they will take it to court to fight the contract. The jury consists of 12 condemned men from Devil&#x27;s Island and Judge Roy Bean, the hanging judge, presides over the trial. After Atilla the Hun, Billy the Kid, and Blackbeard all testify to what Mr. Zero has done for their careers, Mike calls Mr. Zero to the stand and tells him that he did not give Peter the ability to play the harp and that it was within Peter the whole time due to his love for the harp. He then convinces Peter to prove it to Mr. Zero and everyone in the courtroom by playing the harp after Mr. Zero takes away the power. Peter then plays a rendition of the Monkees&#x27; song &quot;I Wanna Be Free&quot;; he is found not guilty and the case is dismissed. Peter is set free and Mr. Zero snaps his fingers and returns to Hell.
* Canadian studio Nelvana created an animated TV special called &quot;The Devil and Daniel Mouse&quot; based on the story. In the program, Daniel Mouse is a musician whose partner, Jan, sells her soul to the devil in exchange for fame.
* Two Chick Publications tracts, &quot;The Contract!&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s A Deal&quot;, borrow heavily from the story. &quot;The Contract!&quot; follows the original plot more closely (telling of a bankrupt farmer facing eviction), while &quot;It&#x27;s a Deal&quot; features a young basketball player. In both stories, the soul-seller is saved not through a legal trial, but by accepting Christ as his saviour, since Christ has the power to redeem any soul regardless of a contract.
* In his court order rejecting plaintiff&#x27;s motion to proceed &quot;in forma pauperis&quot; in the lawsuit &quot;United States ex rel. Gerald Mayo v. Satan and His Staff&quot;, 54 F.R.D. 282 (1971), Judge Gerald J. Weber cited this story as the sole, though &quot;unofficial&quot;, precedent touching on the jurisdiction of U.S. courts over Satan.
* In the 1995 &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; TV special, &quot;Night Ghoulery&quot;, this story is parodied in the segment &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webfoot&quot;.
* In the &quot;Supernatural&quot; episode &quot;Captives&quot;, it is revealed that Crowley, the &quot;de facto&quot; king of Hell, rented several storage units under the alias &quot;D. Webster&quot; as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the short story.
* In the fifth episode of &quot;Tripping the Rift&quot;, the story is parodied under the title of &quot;The Devil and a Guy Named Webster&quot;. When the lead character accidentally sells his soul to the devil, the crew then travel back in time to find Webster, but dial the wrong time zone and get a child actor who played a character called Webster.
*In the third episode of &quot;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,&quot; a lawyer named Daniel Webster represents Sabrina in a trial plot loosely resembling the short story.
*In Leif Enger&#x27;s critically acclaimed novel &quot;Peace Like a River,&quot; Reuben compares his brother Davy&#x27;s trial to that of Jabez Stone and Mr. DeCuellar to Daniel Webster.

<doc id="145640" wikidata="Q1167120" url="?curid=145640" title="The Gospel According to St. Matthew (film)">
<text>The Gospel According to St. Matthew () is a 1964 epic biblical drama film, written and directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini. It is a cinematic rendition of the story of Jesus according to the Gospel of Matthew, from the Nativity through the Resurrection. 

In the neorealist tradition, the film utilizes a cast of non-professional actors, and is filmed entirely on-location throughout Southern Italy. The dialogue is taken directly from the Gospel of Matthew, as Pasolini felt that &quot;images could never reach the poetic heights of the text.&quot; He reportedly chose Matthew&#x27;s Gospel over the others because he felt &quot;John was too mystical, Mark too vulgar, and Luke too sentimental.&quot;

&quot;The Gospel According to St. Matthew&quot; premiered on 4 September 1964 at the 25th Venice International Film Festival, where it won the Grand Jury Prize and three Nastro d&#x27;Argento Awards, including Best Director. It was nominated for three Oscars—Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design and Best Score. In 2015, the Vatican City newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; called it the best film on Christ ever made. The film is considered a classic of world cinema and the neorealist genre.

In Galilee during the Roman Empire, Jesus of Nazareth travels around the country with his disciples, healing the blind, raising the dead, exorcising demons and proclaiming the arrival of the Kingdom of God and the salvation of Israel. He claims to be the Son of God and so, therefore, the prophesied Messiah of Israel, which brings him into direct confrontation with the Jewish temple leaders. He is arrested, handed over to the Romans and charged with sedition against the Roman state, of which he is declared innocent by the Roman governor of Judea, but is, nevertheless, crucified at the behest of the Temple leaders. He rises from the dead after three days.

==Production==

===Background and pre-production===
In 1963, the figure of Christ appeared in Pier Paolo Pasolini&#x27;s short film &quot;La ricotta&quot;, included in the omnibus film &quot;RoGoPaG&quot;, which led to controversy and a jail sentence for the allegedly blasphemous and obscene content in the film. According to Barth David Schwartz&#x27;s book &quot;Pasolini Requiem&quot; (1992), the impetus for the film took place in 1962. Pasolini had accepted Pope John XXIII&#x27;s invitation for a new dialogue with non-Catholic artists, and subsequently visited the town of Assisi to attend a seminar at a Franciscan monastery there. The papal visit caused traffic jams in the town, leaving Pasolini confined to his hotel room; there, he came across a copy of the New Testament. Pasolini read all four Gospels straight through, and he claimed that adapting a film from one of them &quot;threw in the shade all the other ideas for work I had in my head.&quot; Unlike previous cinematic depictions of Jesus&#x27; life, Pasolini&#x27;s film does not embellish the biblical account with any literary or dramatic inventions, nor does it present an amalgam of the four Gospels (subsequent films which would adhere as closely as possible to one Gospel account are 1979&#x27;s &quot;Jesus&quot;, based on the Gospel of Luke, and 2003&#x27;s &quot;The Gospel of John&quot;). Pasolini stated that he decided to &quot;remake the Gospel by analogy&quot; and the film&#x27;s sparse dialogue all comes directly from the Bible.

Given Pasolini&#x27;s well-known reputation as an atheist, a homosexual, and a Marxist, the reverential nature of the film came as a surprise, especially after the controversy of &quot;La ricotta&quot;. At a press conference in 1966, Pasolini was asked why he, an unbeliever, had made a film which dealt with religious themes; his response was, &quot;If you know that I am an unbeliever, then you know me better than I do myself. I may be an unbeliever, but I am an unbeliever who has a nostalgia for a belief.&quot; Therefore, he sets his criticism against a backdrop of sheer religious concern for the role assumed by the Church, the organization, for centuries.

On the idea of analogy, Pasolini emphasized his intention of not reproducing exactly a historic, casual Christ, but projecting the present-day society of southern Italy onto that figure, a Christ after 2,000 years of narrative build-up. As he explained,

Along with this method of reconstruction by analogy, we find the idea of myth and epics [...] so when narrating the history of Christ, I did not reconstruct Christ such as he actually was. If I had reconstructed Christ&#x27;s history as it actually was, I would not have made a religious film, since I am not a believer. I do not think Christ was God&#x27;s son. I would have made a positivist or Marxist reconstruction if any, so at the best of cases, a life of one of the five or six thousands saints preaching at that moment in Palestine. However, I did not want to do that, I am not interested in profanations: that is just a fashion I loathe, it is petit bourgeois. I want to consecrate things again, because that is possible, I want to re-mythologize them. I did not want to reconstruct the life of Christ as it really was, I wanted to make the history of Christ plus two thousand years of Christian storytelling about the life of Christ, since it is the two thousands years of Christian history that have mythologized this biography, one that as such would have been virtually insignificant otherwise. My film is the life of Christ after two thousands years of stories on the life of Christ. That is what I had in mind.

The film was dedicated to John XXIII. The announcement at the opening credits reads that it is &quot;dedicato alla cara, lieta, familiare memoria di Giovanni XXIII&quot; (&quot;dedicated to the dear, joyous, familiar memory of Pope John XXIII&quot;). Pasolini was particularly critical with the new Pope Paul VI (1963), at a moment when he was drafting a storyboard for a follow-up to the film, this time on Paul the Apostle. The project due for 1966–1967 never took off, but it was advanced.

===Filming and style===
Pasolini employed many of the techniques of Italian neorealism in the making of his film. Most of the actors he hired were non-professionals. Enrique Irazoqui (Jesus) was a 19-year-old economics student from Spain and a communist activist, while the rest of the cast were mainly locals from Barile, Matera, and Massafra, where the film was shot (Pasolini visited the Holy Land but found the locations unsuitable and &quot;commercialized&quot;). His location scouting in the Holy Land is documented in the adjoining feature-length documentary &quot;Location Hunting in Palestine&quot;, released a year later. Pasolini cast his own mother, Susanna, as the elderly mother of Jesus. The cast also included noted intellectuals such as writers Enzo Siciliano, Alfonso Gatto, and Natalia Ginzburg, poet Rodolfo Wilcock, and philosopher Giorgio Agamben. In addition to the original biblical source, Pasolini used references to &quot;2,000 years of Christian painting and sculptures&quot; throughout the film. The look of the characters is also eclectic and, in some cases, anachronistic, resembling artistic depictions of different eras (the costumes of the Roman soldiers and the Pharisees, for example, are influenced by Renaissance art, whereas Jesus&#x27; appearance has been likened to that in Byzantine art as well as the work of Expressionist artist Georges Rouault).

Pasolini described his experience filming &quot;The Gospel According to Matthew&quot; as very different from his previous films. He stated that while his shooting style on his previous film &quot;Accattone&quot; was &quot;reverential,&quot; when his shooting style was applied to a biblical source it &quot;came out rhetorical. ... And then when I was shooting the baptism scene near Viterbo I threw over all my technical preconceptions. I started using the zoom, I used new camera movements, new frames which were not reverential, but almost documentary [combining] an almost classical severity with the moments that are almost Godardian, for example in the two trials of Christ shot like &#x27;cinema verite.&#x27; ... The Point is that ... I, a non-believer, was telling the story through the eyes of a believer. The mixture at the narrative level produced the mixture stylistically.&quot;

===Music===
The score of the film, arranged by Luis Enríquez Bacalov, is eclectic; ranging from Johann Sebastian Bach (e.g. &quot;Mass in B Minor&quot; and &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;) to Odetta (&quot;Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child&quot;), to Blind Willie Johnson (&quot;Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground&quot;), to the Jewish ceremonial declaration &quot;Kol Nidre&quot; and the &quot;Gloria&quot; from the Congolese &quot;Missa Luba.&quot; Pasolini stated that all of the film&#x27;s music was of a sacred or religious nature from all parts of the world and multiple cultures or belief systems. Bacalov also composed several original musical tracks.

==Reception==

The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, including several Christian critics. Philip French called it &quot;a noble film,&quot; and Alexander Walker said that &quot;it grips the historical and psychological imagination like no other religious film I have seen. And for all its apparent simplicity, it is visually rich and contains strange, disturbing hints and undertones about Christ and his mission.&quot;

Some Marxist film critics, however, wrote unfavorable reviews. Oswald Stack criticized the film&#x27;s &quot;abject concessions to reactionary ideology.&quot; In response to criticism from the left, Pasolini admitted that, in his opinion, &quot;there are some horrible moments I am ashamed of. ... The Miracle of the loaves and the fishes and Christ walking on water are disgusting pietism.&quot; He also stated that the film was &quot;a reaction against the conformity of Marxism. The mystery of life and death and of suffering – and particularly of religion ... is something that Marxists do not want to consider. But these are and have always been questions of great importance for human beings.&quot;

The Russian film director Andrei Tarkovsky liked the film.

&quot;The Gospel According to Matthew&quot; was ranked number 10 (in 2010) and number 7 (in 2011) in the &quot;Arts and Faith&quot; website&#x27;s Top 100 Films, also is in the Vatican&#x27;s list of 45 great films and Roger Ebert&#x27;s Great Movies list.

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 92%, based on 36 reviews, and an average rating of 8.6 out of 10, with the critics consensus saying &quot;&quot;The Gospel According to St. Matthew&quot; forgoes the pageantry of biblical epics in favor of a naturalistic retelling of the Christ story, achieving a respectful if not reverent interpretation with political verve.&quot;

==Awards==
At the 25th Venice International Film Festival, &quot;The Gospel According to Matthew&quot; was screened in competition for the Golden Lion, and won the OCIC Award and the Silver Lion. At the film&#x27;s premiere, a crowd gathered to boo Pasolini but cheered him after the film was over. The film later won the Grand Prize at the International Catholic Film Office.

The film was nominated for the UN Award at the 21st British Academy Film Awards.

&quot;The Gospel According to Matthew&quot; was released in the United States in 1966 and was nominated for three Academy Awards: Art Direction (Luigi Scaccianoce), Costume Design (Danilo Donati), and Score.

==Alternate versions==
The 2007 Region 1 DVD release from Legend Films features a colourised, English-dubbed version of the film, in addition to the original, black-and-white Italian-language version. (The English-dubbed version is significantly shorter than the original, with a running time of 91 minutes – roughly 40 minutes shorter than the standard version.)

<text>Wentworth Woodhouse is a Grade I listed country house in the village of Wentworth, in the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham in South Yorkshire, England. It is currently owned by the Wentworth Woodhouse Preservation Trust. The building has more than 300 rooms, with of floorspace, including of living area, and was – until it ceased to be privately owned – often listed as the largest private residence in the United Kingdom. It covers an area of more than , and is surrounded by a park, and an estate of .

The original Jacobean house was rebuilt by Thomas Watson-Wentworth, 1st Marquess of Rockingham (1693–1750), and vastly expanded by his son, the 2nd Marquess, who was twice Prime Minister, and who established Wentworth Woodhouse as a Whig centre of influence. In the 18th century, the house was inherited by the Earls Fitzwilliam and the family of the last earl owned it until 1989. It now belongs to the Wentworth Woodhouse Preservation Trust and is undergoing restoration.

==History==

The English Baroque, brick-built, western range of Wentworth Woodhouse was begun in 1725 by Thomas Watson-Wentworth, (after 1728 Lord Malton) after he inherited it from his father in 1723. It replaced the Jacobean structure that was once the home of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, whom Charles I sacrificed in 1641 to appease Parliament. The builder to whom Wentworth&#x27;s grandson turned for a plan for the grand scheme that he intended was a local builder and country architect, Ralph Tunnicliffe, who had a practice in Derbyshire and South Yorkshire. Tunnicliffe was pleased enough with this culmination of his provincial practice to issue an engraving signed &quot;R. Tunniclif, &quot;architectus&quot;&quot; which must date before 1734, as it is dedicated to Baron Malton, Watson-Wentworth&#x27;s earlier title. However the Baroque style was disliked by Whigs, and the new house was not admired. In , before the West Front was finished, Wentworth&#x27;s grandson Thomas Watson-Wentworth commissioned Henry Flitcroft to build the East Front &quot;extension&quot;, in fact a new and much larger house, facing the other way, southeastward. The model they settled on was Colen Campbell&#x27;s Wanstead House, illustrated in &quot;Vitruvius Britannicus&quot; in 1715.

That same year the rebuilding was already well underway. In a letter from the amateur architect Sir Thomas Robinson of Rokeby to his father-in-law Lord Carlisle of 6 June 1734, Sir Thomas reports that he found the garden front &quot;finished&quot; and that a start had been made on the main front: &quot;when finished &#x27;twill be a stupendous fabric, infinitely superior to anything we have now in England&quot;, and he adds &quot;The whole finishing will be entirely submitted to Lord Burlington, and I know of no subject&#x27;s house in Europe will have 7 such magnificent rooms so finely proportioned as these will be.&quot; In the 20th century, Nikolaus Pevsner would agree, but the mention of the architect-earl Burlington, arbiter of architectural taste, boded ill for the provincial surveyor-builder, Tunnicliffe. It is doubtless to Burlington&#x27;s intervention that about this time, before the West Front was finished, the Earl of Malton, as he had now become, commissioned Henry Flitcroft to revise Tunnicliffe&#x27;s plan there and build the East Front range. Flitcroft was Burlington&#x27;s professional architectural amanuensis— &quot;Burlington Harry&quot; as he was called; he had prepared for the engravers the designs of Inigo Jones published by Burlington and William Kent in 1727, and in fact Kent was also called in for confabulation over Wentworth Woodhouse, mediated by Sir Thomas Robinson, though in the event the pedestrian Flitcroft was not unseated and continued to provide designs for the house over the following decade: he revised and enlarged Tunnicliffe&#x27;s provincial Baroque West Front and added wings, as well as temples and other structures in the park. Contemporary engravings of the grand public East Front give Flitcroft as architect. Flitcroft, right-hand man of the architectural &quot;dilettanti&quot; and fully occupied as well at the Royal Board of Works, could not constantly be on-site, however: Francis Bickerton, surveyor and builder of York, paid bills in 1738 and 1743.

The grand East Front is the more often illustrated. The West front, the &quot;garden front&quot; that Sir Thomas Robinson found to be finished in 1734, is the private front that looked onto a &quot;giardino segreto&quot; between the house front and the walled kitchen garden, intended for family enjoyment rather than social and political ambitions expressed in the East Front. Most remnants of it were redesigned in the 19th century.

Wentworth Woodhouse was inherited by Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham, briefly Prime Minister in 1765–66 and again in 1782. He received Benjamin Franklin here in 1771. The architect he employed at the house was John Carr of York, who added an extra storey to parts of the East Front and provided the porticoes to the matching wings, each the equivalent of a moderately grand country house. James &quot;Athenian&quot; Stuart contributed designs for panels in the Pillared Hall. The Whistlejacket Room was named for George Stubbs&#x27; portrait that hung in it of Whistlejacket, one of the most famous racehorses of all time. The additions were completed in 1772. The second Marquess envisaged a sculpture gallery at the house, which never came to fruition; four marbles by Joseph Nollekens were carried out to his commission, in expectation of the gallery; the &quot;Diana&quot;, signed and dated 1778, is now at the Victoria and Albert Museum, the &quot;Juno&quot;, &quot;Venus&quot; and &quot;Minerva&quot;, grouped with a Roman antique marble of &quot;Paris&quot;, are at the J. Paul Getty Museum. Wentworth Woodhouse, with all its contents, subsequently passed to the family of the Marquess&#x27;s sister, the Earls Fitzwilliam.

===Royal visit of 1912===
King George V and Queen Mary visited south Yorkshire from 8 to 12 July 1912 and stayed at Wentworth Woodhouse for four days. The house party consisted of a large number of guests, including: Dr Cosmo Gordon Lang, the then-Archbishop of York; the Earl of Harewood and his Countess; the Marchioness of Londonderry; the Marquess of Zetland and Lady Zetland; the Earl of Scarborough and Lady Scarborough; the Earl of Rosse and Lady Rosse; Admiral Lord Charles Beresford and Lady Mina Beresford; Mr Walter Long and Lady Doreen Long; and Lord Helmsley and Lady Helmsley.

The royal visit concluded on the evening of 11 July with a torchlight tattoo by miners, and a musical programme by members of the Sheffield Musical Union and the Wentworth Choral Society. A crowd of 25,000 gathered on the lawn to witness the King and Queen on the balcony of the portico, from which the King gave a speech.

===Intelligence connection in the Second World War===
During the Second World War, the house served as Training Depot and Headquarters of the Intelligence Corps, although by 1945 conditions for trainee intelligence soldiers had deteriorated so far that questions were asked in the House of Commons. Some of the training involved motorcycle dispatch rider skills, as Intelligence Corps personnel often used motorcycles. The grounds of the house and surrounding road network were used as motorcycle training areas.

===Lease to Lady Mabel College===
The Ministry of Health attempted to requisition the house as &quot;housing for homeless industrial families&quot;. To prevent this, the 7th Earl attempted to donate the house to the National Trust, but the Trust declined to take it. In the end, Lady Mabel Fitzwilliam, sister of the 7th Earl and a local alderman, brokered a deal whereby the West Riding County Council leased most of the house for an educational establishment, leaving forty rooms as a family apartment. Thus, from 1949 to 1979, the house was home to the Lady Mabel College of Physical Education, which trained female physical education teachers. The college later merged with Sheffield City Polytechnic (now Sheffield Hallam University), which eventually gave up the lease in 1988 as a result of high maintenance costs.

===Sheffield City Polytechnic===

The period 1979 to 1988 saw students from Sheffield City Polytechnic (now Sheffield Hallam University) based at Wentworth Woodhouse. Two departments, Physical Education and Geography and Environmental Studies, were based on site. The main house housed student accommodation and a dining room and kitchens for lunch and dinner for students living on site. Five separate blocks of modern student accommodation (Stubbs, Brameld, Repton, Flitcroft and Rockingham) were built in the grounds of the deer park. The Stable Block became the centre of student life, housing offices, lecture rooms, laboratories, squash courts, a swimming pool, and a student bar.

===Sale by the Fitzwilliam family===
By 1989, Wentworth Woodhouse was in a poor state of repair. With the polytechnic no longer a tenant, and with the family no longer requiring the house, the family trustees decided to sell it and the surrounding it, but retained the Wentworth Estate&#x27;s of land. The house was bought by locally born businessman Wensley Grosvenor Haydon-Baillie, who started a programme of restoration, but a business failure saw it repossessed by a Swiss bank and put back on the market in 1998. Clifford Newbold (July 1926 – April 2015), an architect from Highgate, bought it for something over £1.5 million. Newbold progressed with a programme of renovation and restoration, as described in &quot;Country Life&quot; magazine dated 17 and 24 February 2010. The surrounding parkland is owned by the Wentworth Estates.

In 2014, the house was informally offered for sale by Newbold, with no price specified, but a figure of around £7 million was thought to be sought according to &quot;The Times&quot;. The house was reported to need works of around £40 million. Following Newbold&#x27;s death, the house was advertised for sale in May 2015 via Savills with an asking price of £8 million. In February 2016, it was sold to the Wentworth Woodhouse Preservation Trust (WWPT) for £7 million after a potential sale to the Hong Kong-based Lake House Group fell through.

On 23 November 2016, in the United Kingdom Chancellor&#x27;s budget statement of November 2016, it was announced that the Trust was to receive a grant of £7.6 million for restoration work; the Chancellor Philip Hammond noted a claim that the property had been Jane Austen&#x27;s inspiration for Pemberley in her novel &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. It was thought that there might have been a connection to the house because Austen uses the name Fitzwilliam in her novel, but following the Chancellor&#x27;s Autumn Statement the Jane Austen Society dismissed the likelihood, given the absence of any evidence that she had visited the estate.

Welcoming the grant, Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg dismissed a widely circulated meme claiming that his family benefited from it.

As of 2022, the National Trust was working in partnership with the WWPT to support their ambitions for the site as a visitor attraction; the Trust does not own the property.

==Coal mining on the estate==
In April 1946, on the orders of Manny Shinwell (the then Labour Party&#x27;s Minister of Fuel and Power), a &quot;column of lorries and heavy plant machinery&quot; arrived at Wentworth. The objective was the mining of a large part of the estate close to the house for coal. This was an area where the prolific Barnsley seam was within of the surface and the area in front of the Baroque West wing of the house became the largest open-cast mining site in Britain at that time: 132,000 tons of coal were removed solely from the gardens. Ostensibly the coal was desperately needed in Britain&#x27;s austere post-war economy to fuel the railways, but the decision has been widely seen as useful cover for an act of class-war spite against the coal-owning aristocracy. A survey by Sheffield University, commissioned by the 8th Earl Fitzwilliam, found the coal to be &quot;very poor stuff&quot; and &quot;not worth the getting&quot;; this contrasted with Shinwell&#x27;s assertion that it was &quot;exceptionally good-quality.&quot;

Shinwell, seemingly intent on the destruction of &quot;the privileged rich&quot;, decreed that the mining would continue right up to Wentworth Woodhouse. What followed saw the mining of of lawns and woods, the renowned formal gardens and the show-piece pink shale driveway (a by-product of the family&#x27;s collieries). Ancient trees were uprooted and the debris of earth and rubble was piled high in front of the family&#x27;s living quarters.

Local opinion supported the earl. Joe Hall, President of the Yorkshire Area of the National Union of Mineworkers, said that the &quot;miners in this area will go to almost any length rather than see Wentworth Woodhouse destroyed. To many mining communities it is sacred ground&quot;. In an industry known for harsh treatment of workers, the Fitzwilliams were respected employers known for treating their employees well. The Yorkshire branch later threatened a strike over the Labour government&#x27;s plans for Wentworth, and Joe Hall wrote personally to Clement Attlee in a futile attempt to stop the mining. This spontaneous local activism, founded on the genuine popularity of the Fitzwilliam family among locals, was dismissed in Whitehall as &quot;intrigue&quot; sponsored by the earl.

The open-cast mining moved into the fields to the west of the house and continued into the early 1950s. The mined areas took many years to return to a natural state; much of the woodland and the formal gardens were not replaced. The current owners of the property allege that mining operations near the house caused substantial structural damage to the building due to subsidence, and lodged a claim in 2012 of £100 million for remedial works against the Coal Authority. The claim was heard by the Lands Chamber of the Upper Tribunal in April 2016. In its decision dated 4 October 2016 the tribunal found that the damage claimed for was not caused by mining subsidence.

Two sets of death duties in the 1940s, and the nationalisation of the Fitzwilliam coal mines, greatly reduced the wealth of the family, and most of the contents of the house were dispersed in auction sales in 1948, 1986, and 1998. In the Christies sale of 1948, &quot;Rinaldo conquered by Love for Armida&quot; by Anthony van Dyck raised 4,600 Guineas (equivalent to £ in ). Many items still remain in the family, with many works lent to museums by the &quot;Trustees of the Fitzwilliam Estates&quot;.

==Architecture==
Wentworth Woodhouse comprises two joined houses, forming west and east fronts. The original house, now the west front, with the garden range facing northwest towards the village, was built of brick with stone details. The east front of unsurpassed length is credibly said to have been built as the result of a rivalry with the Stainborough branch of the Wentworth family, which inherited Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford&#x27;s minor title of Baron Raby, but not his estates (including the notable series of Strafford portraits by Anthony van Dyck and Daniel Mytens), which went to Watson who added Wentworth to his surname. The Stainborough Wentworths, for whom the Strafford earldom was revived, lived at nearby Wentworth Castle, which was purchased in 1708 in a competitive spirit and strenuously rebuilt in a magnificent manner.

==Park==
Having finished the course of alterations in the hands of John Carr, Lord Fitzwilliam turned in 1790 to the most prominent landscape gardener, Humphry Repton, for whom this was the season&#x27;s most ambitious project, one that he would describe in detail while the memory was still fresh, in &quot;Some Observations of the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening&quot; (1803). A terrace centred on the main block effected a transition between the house and the rolling grazing land. Four obelisks stood on the bowling green, dwarfed by the scale of the house; Repton re-sited them. Though the parkland had accumulated numerous eye-catchers and features (&quot;see below&quot;), Repton found there were few trees, the house being surrounded by &quot;coarse grass and boulders&quot; which Repton also removed, before the large-scale earth-moving operations began, effected by men with shovels and donkey-carts, to reshape the lumpy ground into smooth swells. Two large pools, visible from the East Front and the approach drive, were excavated into a serpentine shape. Some of Flitcroft&#x27;s outbuildings were demolished, though not Carr&#x27;s handsome stable court (1768), entered through a pedimented Tuscan arch. Many trees were planted.

===Follies and garden buildings===
The grounds (and surrounding area) contain a number of follies and other garden structures, many with associations in the arena of 18th-century Whig politics. They include:
* Hoober Stand. A tapering pyramid with a hexagonal lantern, named for the ancient wood in which it was erected. It is high and was built to Flitcroft&#x27;s design in 1747–48 to commemorate the defeat of the Jacobite rebellion of 1745, in which Lord Malton and his surviving son took part; his defensive efforts for the Hanoverian Whig establishment were rewarded with the Lord Lieutenancy of Yorkshire and the title Marquess of Rockingham: thus the monument indirectly reflects the greater glory of the family. The tower, which surveys the surrounding landscape like a watchtower, is open to the public on Sunday afternoons throughout the summer.
* Keppel&#x27;s Column. A 115 ft (35 m) Tuscan column built to commemorate the acquittal of the court-martialed Admiral Keppel, a close friend of Rockingham. Its entasis visibly bulges owing to an adjustment in its height, made when funding problems reduced the height. It was designed by John Carr.
* The Rockingham Mausoleum. A three-storey building 90 ft (27 m) high, situated in woodland, where only the top level is visible over the treetops. It was commissioned in 1783 by the Earl Fitzwilliam as a memorial to the late first Marquess of Rockingham; it was designed by John Carr, whose first design, for an obelisk, was rejected, in favour of an adaptation of the Roman Cenotaph of the Julii at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, near Arles. The ground floor is an enclosed hall containing a statue of the former prime minister by Joseph Nollekens, plus busts of his eight closest friends. The first floor is an open colonnade with Corinthian columns surrounding the (empty) sarcophagus. The top storey is a Roman-style cupola. Like Hoober Stand, the Mausoleum is open on summer Sunday afternoons.
* Needle&#x27;s Eye. A high, sandstone block pyramid with an ornamental urn on the top and a tall Gothic ogee arch through the middle, which straddles a disused roadway. It was built in the 18th century allegedly to win a bet after the second Marquess claimed he could drive a coach and horses through the eye of a needle.
* Bear Pit. Accessible if patronising the nearby Garden centre. Built on two levels with a spiral stair. The outer doorway (about 1630) is part of the architecture of the original house. At the end of the garden is a grotto guarded by two life-sized statues of Roman soldiers.
* Camellia House. The Camellia House, dating mainly from the early 19th century though with late 18th century elements, was built to contain the family&#x27;s collection of &quot;Camellia&quot; bushes brought from India. A grade II* listed building, it represents a rare survival of such a plant collection, with the oldest dating back to 1792. The Camellia House was restored from dereliction in the early 2020s as part of the restoration of the house, and reopened as a teahouse in 2024.

===Historic listing designations===
Many of the structures built by the Rockingham family on and around the Wentworth Woodhouse estate are listed by Historic England. Buildings are listed at one of three grades, I, II* and II, for their architectural and/or historical importance. The house, the stable block and the Rockingham Mausoleum are listed Grade I. Seven structures are listed at Grade II*; the Camellia House, the Needle&#x27;s Eye, the gateway into the South Court of the house, Keppel&#x27;s Column, the Hoober Stand and the Ionic and Doric Temples. The park itself is also listed at Grade II* on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England. Structures listed at Grade II include: the run of lampstands on the east front of the house; the Octagon, North, Mausoleum, Peacock and Doric lodges, together with the gates at the Doric Lodge; a number of farm buildings including a dovecote and a duck house; water features including two bridges, a causeway, a cascade and two fountains in pools; three ranges of walls; the Bear Pit and two adjacent statues of Roman soldiers; a garden house, a milestone, a pair of gate piers a Ha-ha and an array of garden statuary including four sets of urns; a pair of vases and the bases of two sundials, the sundials themselves having been removed.

==Publication==
The 2011 BBC series entitled &quot;The Country House Revealed&quot; was accompanied by a full-length illustrated companion book, published by the BBC, which featured a dedicated chapter on Wentworth Woodhouse (Chapter Four). The six chapters of the book corresponded to the six episodes of the television series.

<text>Walter Davis Pidgeon (September 23, 1897 – September 25, 1984) was a Canadian-American actor. A major leading man during the Golden Age of Hollywood, known for his &quot;portrayals of men who prove both sturdy and wise,&quot; Pidgeon earned two Academy Award nominations for Best Actor, for his roles in &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; (1942) and &quot;Madame Curie&quot; (1943).

Pidgeon also starred in many other notable films, such as &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; (1941), &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; (1952), &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; (1956), &quot;Executive Suite&quot; (1954), &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; (1961), &quot;Advise &amp; Consent&quot; (1962), &quot;Funny Girl&quot; (1968), and &quot;Harry in Your Pocket&quot; (1973).

Aside from his acting career, Pidgeon served as the 10th President of the Screen Actors Guild, between 1952 and 1957. He received the Guild&#x27;s Life Achievement Award in 1975, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960, for his contributions to the motion picture industry.

==Early life and education==
Born in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, Pidgeon was the son of Hannah (née Sanborn), a housewife, and Caleb Burpee Pidgeon, a haberdasher.

Pidgeon received his formal education in local schools and the University of New Brunswick, where he studied law and drama. His university education was interrupted by World War I when he volunteered with the 65th Battery, as a lieutenant in the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery. He never saw action, however, as he was severely injured in an accident when he was crushed between two gun carriages and spent seventeen months in a military hospital. His Officer Attestation states he was born in 1895 but further medical records state 1896. 

Following the war, he moved to Boston, Massachusetts, where he worked as a bank runner, at the same time studying voice at the Boston Conservatory.

==Career==
While he was performing in amateur theatricals in Boston, Pidgeon was hired by Elsie Janis, a producer, actor and singer looking for a male singer for her revue. Pidgeon moved to New York City in 1923, where he was interviewed by E.E. Clive, a British producer working on Broadway. Pidgeon made his first featured Broadway debut in Janis&#x27; 1925 revue &quot;Puzzles of 1925&quot;. Clive was producing &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot;, and he cast Pidgeon in a supporting role despite Pidgeon&#x27;s lack of theatrical experience. 

Pidgeon&#x27;s success created a rift between Janis and him, leading to Pidgeon&#x27;s dismissal and his move to Hollywood. His first role was in silent film &quot;Mannequin&quot; (1925). Discouraged with the quality of the roles he was getting, Pidgeon returned to New York in 1928 to resume his theater career. With the advent of sound films, Pidgeon starred in musicals &quot;Bride of the Regiment&quot; (1930), &quot;Sweet Kitty Bellairs&quot; (1930), &quot;Viennese Nights&quot; (1930) and &quot;Kiss Me Again&quot; (1931). In 1935, he appeared onstage on Broadway in &quot;Something Gay&quot;, &quot;Night of January 16th&quot;, and &quot;There&#x27;s Wisdom in Women&quot;.

Pidgeon returned to film in 1937 as a dramatic actor in &quot;Saratoga&quot; (1937), then acted in &quot;The Girl of the Golden West&quot; (1938) and &quot;Dark Command&quot; (1940).
In 1941, Pidgeon starred in the Academy Award-winning Best Picture &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; (1941). He starred with Greer Garson in &quot;Blossoms in the Dust&quot; (1941), &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; (1942) (for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor) and its sequel, &quot;The Miniver Story&quot; (1950). He was also nominated for &quot;Madame Curie&quot; (1943), again with Garson. His partnership with her continued throughout the 1940s and into the 1950s with &quot;Mrs. Parkington&quot; (1944), &quot;Julia Misbehaves&quot; (1948), &quot;That Forsyte Woman&quot; (1949), and finally &quot;Scandal at Scourie&quot; (1953). He also starred as Chip Collyer in the comedy &quot;Week-End at the Waldorf&quot; (1945) and later as Colonel Michael S. &#x27;Hooky&#x27; Nicobar, who was given the difficult task of repatriating Russians in post-World War II Vienna in &quot;The Red Danube&quot; (1949).

Although he continued to make films, including &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; (1952), &quot;Executive Suite&quot; (1954) and &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; (1956), Pidgeon returned to work on Broadway in the mid-1950s after a 20-year absence. He was featured in &quot;Take Me Along&quot; with Jackie Gleason and received a Tony Award nomination for the musical play. He continued making films, playing Admiral Harriman Nelson in 1961&#x27;s &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;, James Haggin in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Big Red&quot; (1962), and the Senate Majority Leader in Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;Advise &amp; Consent&quot;. His role as Florenz Ziegfeld in &quot;Funny Girl&quot; (1968) was well received. Later, he played Casey, James Coburn&#x27;s sidekick, in &quot;Harry in Your Pocket&quot; (1973).

Pidgeon guest-starred in the episode &quot;King of the Valley&quot; (November 26, 1959) on &quot;Dick Powell&#x27;s Zane Grey Theatre&quot;. Pidgeon played Dave King, a prosperous rancher who quarrels with his banker over a $10,000 loan.

His other television credits included &quot;Rawhide&quot; (&quot;The Reunion&quot;, 1962). &quot;Breaking Point&quot;, &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;, &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;, and &quot;Gibbsville&quot;. In 1963 he guest-starred as corporate attorney Sherman Hatfield in the fourth of four special episodes of &quot;Perry Mason&quot; while Raymond Burr was recovering from surgery. In 1965, he played the king in Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s CBS television production of &quot;Cinderella&quot;, starring Lesley Ann Warren. Pidgeon retired from acting in 1977.

==Politics==
A Republican, Pidgeon joined celebrity Republicans in 1944 at a rally in the Los Angeles Coliseum arranged by David O. Selznick to support the Dewey−Bricker ticket and Governor Earl Warren of California, who was Dewey&#x27;s running mate in 1948. The gathering drew 93,000, with Cecil B. DeMille as the master of ceremonies and short speeches by Hedda Hopper and Walt Disney.

==Personal life==
In 1919, Pidgeon wed Edna Muriel Pickles, who died during the birth of their daughter, Edna (1921–1978). In 1931, Pidgeon married his secretary, Ruth Walker, to whom he remained married until his death.

Pidgeon became a United States citizen on December 24, 1943.

==Death==
Pidgeon died on September 25, 1984, age 87, in Santa Monica, California, following a series of strokes.

Walter Pidgeon has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6414 Hollywood Boulevard in California.

<doc id="145645" wikidata="Q1393843" url="?curid=145645" title="Monty Woolley">
<text>Edgar Montillion &quot;Monty&quot; Woolley (August 17, 1888May 6, 1963) was an American film and theater actor. At the age of 50, he achieved a measure of stardom for his role in the 1939 stage play &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; and its 1942 film adaptation. His distinctive white beard was his trademark and he was affectionately known as &quot;The Beard.&quot;

==Early life==
Woolley was born in the New York City borough of Manhattan to William Edgar Woolley (1845-1927) and Jessie née Arms (1857-1927) and grew up in the highest social circles. Woolley received a bachelor&#x27;s degree at Yale University, where Cole Porter was an intimate friend and classmate, and master&#x27;s degrees from Yale and Harvard Universities. He eventually became an assistant professor of English and drama coach at Yale. Thornton Wilder and Stephen Vincent Benét were among his students. He served in World War I with the U.S. Army as a first lieutenant assigned to the general staff in Paris.

==Acting career==
Woolley began directing on Broadway in 1929 with &quot;Fifty Million Frenchmen&quot;, and began acting there in 1936 after leaving his academic career. In 1939 he starred in the Kaufman and Hart comedy &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; for 783 performances. It was for this well-reviewed role he was typecast as the wasp-tongued, supercilious sophisticate.

Woolley signed with 20th Century Fox in the 1940s and appeared in many films through the mid-1950s. His most famous film role, a reprise of his Broadway role, was in 1941&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Came To Dinner&quot; in which he plays a cranky radio wag restricted to a wheelchair because of a seemingly injured hip, a caricature of the legendary pundit Alexander Woollcott. The film received a good review from the New York Times. He played himself in Warner Bros.&#x27; fictionalized film biography of Cole Porter, &quot;Night and Day&quot; (1946), and the role of Professor Wutheridge in &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1947). In the comedy &quot;As Young as You Feel&quot; (1951) he played a printer who, fired routinely from his job at 65 years old, poses as an executive to get his job back.

He was also a frequent radio guest performer, first appearing in the medium as a foil to Al Jolson. Woolley became a familiar guest on such shows as &quot;The Fred Allen Show&quot;, &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot;, &quot;The Big Show&quot;, &quot;The Chase and Sanborn Hour&quot; with Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, and others. In 1950, Woolley landed the starring role in the NBC series &quot;The Magnificent Montague&quot;. He played a former Shakespearean actor whose long fall onto hard times forced him to swallow his pride and take a role on daily network radio, becoming an unlikely star while sparring with his wife, Lily (Anne Seymour), and his wise-cracking maid, Agnes (Pert Kelton). The show lasted from November 1950 through September 1951.

Woolley first appeared on television in cameos, then in his own dramatic play series &quot;On Stage with Monty Woolley.&quot; He starred in a CBS TV adaptation of &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; in 1954, which he and some reviewers lambasted, and appeared in other televised dramas in the series &quot;Best of Broadway&quot;.

After completing his last film, &quot;Kismet&quot; (1955), he returned to radio for about a year, after which he was forced to retire due to ill health.

Woolley was nominated twice for an Academy Award, as Best Actor in 1943 for &quot;The Pied Piper&quot; and as Best Supporting Actor in 1945 for &quot;Since You Went Away&quot;. He won a Best Actor award from the National Board of Review in 1942 for his role in &quot;The Pied Piper&quot;.

His hands and beard were impressed in the pavement of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in 1943. Woolley received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960, officially listed in the &quot;Motion Picture&quot; category, though his star bears the television emblem. The error of the television emblem was evident, considering his only TV efforts were his classic role as Sheridan Whiteside in a 1954 TV adaptation of &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot;, and another small role in an episode of a short-lived series called &quot;Five Fingers&quot; in 1959.

==Personal life==
Woolley and Cole Porter enjoyed many adventures together in New York and on foreign travels, although Porter reportedly disapproved of Woolley taking a black man as his lover.
Woolley has been described in scholarly and other works as gay and closeted.

Starting in 1939, Woolley was living with a gay companion, Cary Abbott, who had also graduated from Yale in 1911. Abbott was discreetly identified publicly as Woolley&#x27;s &quot;courier-secretary-traveling companion.&quot; In 1942, Woolley and Abbott moved into a house in Saratoga Springs, where they lived together until Abbott&#x27;s death, at age 58, from lung cancer, in 1948.

According to Bennett Cerf in his 1944 book &quot;Try and Stop Me,&quot; Woolley was at a dinner party and suddenly belched. A woman sitting nearby glared at him; he glared back and said, &quot;And what did you expect, my good woman? Chimes?&quot; Cerf wrote, &quot;Woolley was so pleased with this line that he insisted it be written into his next role in Hollywood.&quot;

In 1943, Alfred Hitchcock wrote a mystery story for &quot;Look&quot; titled &quot;The Murder of Monty Woolley.&quot;

Woolley was portrayed by Allan Corduner in the 2004 biopic of Cole Porter, De-Lovely.

==Death==
On April 6, 1963, Woolley was taken to the Saratoga Springs Hospital with heart problems, and two days later transferred to the Albany Hospital. He died of complications from kidney and heart ailments on May 6, 1963, in Albany, New York, aged 74. He is interred at the Greenridge Cemetery, Saratoga Springs, Saratoga County, New York.

<text>Paul Lukas (born Pál Lukács; 26 May 1894 – 15 August 1971) was a Hungarian actor. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor, and the first Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, for his performance in the film &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot; (1943), reprising the role he created on the Broadway stage.

==Biography==
Lukas was born Pál Lukács in Budapest into a Hungarian-Jewish family, the son of Adolf Munkácsi and Mária Schneckendorf. He was later adopted by Mária (née Zilahy) and János Lukács, an advertising executive.

Lukas made his stage debut in Budapest in 1916, and his film debut in 1917. At first, he played elegant, smooth womanizers, but increasingly, he became typecast as a villain. He had a successful stage and film career in Hungary, Germany, and Austria, where he worked with Max Reinhardt. He arrived in Hollywood in 1927, and became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1937. In 1935, he built a home near the new Racquet Club of Palm Springs, California.
Lukas was busy in the 1930s, appearing in such films as the melodrama &quot;Rockabye&quot;, the crime caper &quot;Grumpy&quot;, Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot;, the comedy &quot;Ladies in Love&quot;, and the drama &quot;Dodsworth&quot;. He followed William Powell and Basil Rathbone, portraying the series detective Philo Vance, a cosmopolitan New Yorker, once in &quot;The Casino Murder Case&quot; (1935).

His major film success was &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot; (1943), where he played a man working against the Nazis, a role he originated in the Broadway premiere of the play of the same name in 1941. His portrayal of Kurt Mueller, a German émigré with an American wife, played by Bette Davis, was universally lauded by critics. Brooks Atkinson of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, wrote: &quot;As the enemy of fascism, Mr. Lukas&#x27; haggard, loving, resourceful determination becomes heroic by virtue of his sincerity and his superior abilities as an actor.&quot; He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for the role. He also received the New York Film Critics Award for his performance.

In 1943, Lukas guest-starred as the lead character in an episode of the radio program &quot;Suspense&quot;, &quot;Mr. Markham, Antique Dealer&quot;, as well as the character of a blind composer in the episode &quot;A World of Darkness&quot;. On 2 April 1944, he starred in &quot;The Steadfast Heart&quot; on &quot;Silver Theater&quot;.
In the 1940s, Lukas was a charter member of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, a conservative lobbying group opposed to possible Communist influence in Hollywood.

Lukas also starred as Professor Aronnax in Walt Disney&#x27;s film version of Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; (1954).

Lukas&#x27; film career continued into the 1960s, with nine films, including &quot;Fun in Acapulco&quot; with Elvis Presley in 1963 and &quot;Lord Jim&quot; with Peter O&#x27;Toole in 1965. His final film, &quot;The Challenge&quot;, was released in 1970.

The remainder of his career moved from Hollywood to the stage, and to television. His only singing role was as Cosmo Constantine in the original 1950 Broadway stage version of Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Call Me Madam&quot;, opposite Ethel Merman for over 600 performances (although he is heard singing a song in the 1933 film &quot;Little Women&quot;).

Lukas died 15 August 1971, in Tangier, Morocco, reportedly while searching for a place to spend his retirement years. He is buried in Spain.

==Recognition==
Lukas was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 6821 Hollywood Boulevard, on February 8, 1960.

<text>William Joseph Shields (10 March 1888 – 4 January 1961), known professionally as Barry Fitzgerald, was an Irish stage, film and television actor. In a career spanning almost forty years, he appeared in such notable films as &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; (1938), &quot;The Long Voyage Home&quot; (1940), &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; (1941), &quot;The Sea Wolf&quot; (1941), &quot;Going My Way&quot; (1944), &quot;None but the Lonely Heart&quot; (1944) and &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; (1952). For &quot;Going My Way&quot;, he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and was simultaneously nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for the same performance. He was the older brother of Irish actor Arthur Shields. In 2020, he was listed at number 11 on &quot;The Irish Times&quot; list of Ireland&#x27;s greatest film actors.

==Early life==

Fitzgerald was born William Joseph Shields in Walworth Road, Portobello, Dublin, Ireland, the son of Fanny Sophia (née Ungerland) and Adolphus Shields. His father was Irish and his mother was German. He was the older brother of Irish actor Arthur Shields.

He attended Skerry&#x27;s College in Dublin before going on to work in the civil service, starting as a junior clerk at the Dublin Board of Trade in 1911. He later went to work for the unemployment office. &quot;It was an easy job, full of leisure,&quot; he later said.

==Career==
===Abbey Theatre===
Interested in acting, he began appearing in amateur dramatic societies such as the Kincora Players. He joined his brother Arthur Shields in the Abbey in 1915. He chose the stage name Barry Fitzgerald so as not to get in trouble with his superiors in the civil service.

Fitzgerald&#x27;s early appearances at the Abbey included bit parts in plays such as &quot;The Casting Out of Martin Whelan&quot; and a four-word part in &quot;The Critic&quot;.

His breakthrough performance at the Abbey came in 1919, when he was in &quot;The Dragon&quot; by Lady Gregory. However he continued to act part-time until 1929, keeping his job in the civil service during the day. He was in &quot;The Bribe&quot;, &quot;An Imaginary Conversation&quot;, &quot;John Bull&#x27;s Other Island&quot; and others.
In 1924, Fitzgerald&#x27;s salary at the Abbey was £2/10 a week. That year he appeared in the world premiere of &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot; by famed playwright Seán O&#x27;Casey. Fitzgerald played Captain Jack Boyle.

He received much acclaim for his performance in &quot;Paul Twyning&quot; during 1925. The following year he was in the premiere of O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s &quot;The Plough and the Stars&quot;, playing Fluther Good. The play was controversial, causing riots and protests. One night in February 1926, three gunmen turned up to Fitzgerald&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house intending to kidnap him and prevent the play from being performed, but they were unable to find him.

In 1926, Fitzgerald was in &quot;The Would-Be Gentleman&quot;. Other appearances at the Abbey included &quot;The Far Off Hills&quot;, &quot;Shadow of a Gunman&quot; and &quot;The Playboy&quot;.

O&#x27;Casey wrote a part, especially for Fitzgerald in the play &quot;The Silver Tassie&quot;, but it was rejected by the Abbey. The play was picked up for production in London in 1929. Fitzgerald decided to leave his civil service job to join the production and at age 41, he became a full-time actor.

===Professional actor===
Fitzgerald made his film debut in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s version of &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot; (1930), shot in London.

In early 1931, Fitzgerald toured England in a production of &quot;Paul Twyning&quot;. He returned to Ireland in June of that year to perform the play at the Abbey. Between 1931 and 1936, he appeared in three plays by Irish playwright Teresa Deevy&quot;A Disciple&quot;, &quot;In Search of Valour&quot; and &quot;Katie Roche&quot;which were also Abbey Theatre productions.

In 1932, Fitzgerald travelled to the United States with the Abbey Players to appear in &quot;Things That Are Caesar&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;The Far-off Hills&quot;.

Fitzgerald and the Players returned to the US in 1934 to tour a series of plays in repertory around the country. These included &quot;The Plough and the Stars&quot;, &quot;Drama at Inish&quot;, &quot;The Far-off Hills&quot;, &quot;Look at the Heffernans&quot;, &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot;, &quot;The Shadow of the Glen&quot;, &quot;Church Street&quot;, &quot;The Well of the Saints&quot; and &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot;.

Fitzgerald appeared in a short Irish silent film, &quot;Guests of the Nation&quot;, released only in Ireland in 1935. The film was not seen or distributed outside of Ireland until 2011.

===Hollywood===
In March 1936, Fitzgerald and three other members of the Abbey arrived in Hollywood to star in the film version of &quot;The Plough and the Stars&quot; (1936), directed by John Ford. Fitzgerald decided to remain in Hollywood where he soon found constant employment as a character actor. He had support roles in &quot;Ebb Tide&quot; (1937) at Paramount, &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; (1938) at RKO, &quot;Four Men and a Prayer&quot; (1938) directed by John Ford for 20th Century-Fox, and &quot;The Dawn Patrol&quot; (1938) at Warner Bros.

Fitzgerald made a series of films at RKO: &quot;Pacific Liner&quot; (1939) with Victor McLaglen, and two directed by John Farrow, &quot;The Saint Strikes Back&quot; (1939) and &quot;Full Confession&quot; (1939). In between the two Farrow films, Fitzgerald returned to Broadway in 1939 in &quot;The White Steed&quot;.

After &quot;Full Confession&quot; Fitzgerald went back to Broadway with &quot;Kindred &quot; (1939–40) and a revival of &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot; (1940) which went for 105 performances.

Back in Hollywood, Fitzgerald was reunited with John Ford in &quot;The Long Voyage Home&quot; (1940). He appeared in &quot;San Francisco Docks&quot; (1940) at Universal and &quot;The Sea Wolf&quot; (1941) at Warner Bros., before making another film with Ford, &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; (1941), for Fox. He went to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s Secret Treasure&quot; (1941).

Fitzgerald and Shields starred in &quot;Tanyard Street&quot; (1941) on Broadway, directed by Shields, which only had a short run. However, Fitzgerald&#x27;s personal notices were excellent, &quot;The New York Times&quot; calling him &quot;the incarnation of the comic spirit. People start laughing the moment he pokes his squint face on set.&quot;

Back in Hollywood, Fitzgerald appeared in a series of films for Universal: &quot;The Amazing Mrs. Holliday&quot; (1943), &quot;Two Tickets to London&quot; (1943) and &quot;Corvette K-225&quot; (1943).

===&quot;Going My Way&quot; and stardom===

Fitzgerald unexpectedly became a leading man when Leo McCarey cast him opposite Bing Crosby in &quot;Going My Way&quot; released by Paramount in 1944. The film was a huge success and Fitzgerald&#x27;s performance as Father Fitzgibbon was nominated for both the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (which he ultimately won) and the Academy Award for Best Actor; voting rules were changed shortly after this occurrence to prevent further dual nominations for the same role. An avid golfer, he later accidentally decapitated his Oscar while practising his golf swing. During World War II, Oscar statuettes were made of plaster instead of gold-plated bronze to accommodate wartime metal shortages. The academy provided Fitzgerald with a replacement statuette.

After &quot;Going My Way&quot;, Paramount signed Fitzgerald to a long-term contract. The studio cast him in a supporting role in &quot;I Love a Soldier&quot; (1944) and he was borrowed by RKO for &quot;None But the Lonely Heart&quot; (1944).

In March 1944, Fitzgerald was involved in a car accident which resulted in the death of a woman and the injury of her daughter. He was charged with manslaughter but was acquitted in January 1945 due to lack of evidence.

Back at Paramount, Fitzgerald supported Alan Ladd in &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot;, made in 1944 by John Farrow, but not released until 1946. He supported Betty Hutton in &quot;Incendiary Blonde&quot; (1945) and &quot;The Stork Club&quot; (1945). In between he had a cameo as himself in &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot; (1945) and was borrowed by United Artists to play the lead in &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; (1945), based on the novel and play by Agatha Christie. In January 1945 his fee was reported to be $75,000 a film.

Fitzgerald made two more films with John Farrow: &quot;California&quot; (1947) with Ray Milland and &quot;Easy Come, Easy Go&quot; (1947), where he was top billed.

Paramount reunited Fitzgerald with Bing Crosby in &quot;Welcome Stranger&quot; (1947) and appeared in another cameo as himself in &quot;Variety Girl&quot; (1947).

Mark Hellinger borrowed Fitzgerald to play the lead in a cop film at Universal, &quot;The Naked City&quot; (1948) which was a solid success. Back at Paramount, he was in &quot;The Sainted Sisters&quot; (1948) and &quot;Miss Tatlock&#x27;s Millions&quot; (1948), then appeared in a third film with Crosby, &quot;Top o&#x27; the Morning&quot; (1949).

Fitzgerald went to Warner Bros. for &quot;The Story of Seabiscuit&quot; (1949) with Shirley Temple, then to Paramount for &quot;Union Station&quot; (1950) with William Holden and &quot;Silver City&quot; (1951) with Yvonne de Carlo. He made his television debut with an episode of &quot;The Ford Theatre Hour&quot;, &quot;The White-Headed Boy&quot; in 1950.

===Later career===
Fitzgerald went to Italy to star in the comedy &quot;Ha da venì... don Calogero&quot; (1952). John Ford gave him third billing in the classic &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; (1952) which was shot in Ireland. He then appeared in &quot;Happy Ever After&quot; (1954) with De Carlo and David Niven.

Fitzgerald appeared in TV on episodes of &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;, &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, and &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;.

He had a supporting role in MGM&#x27;s &quot;The Catered Affair&quot; (1956) and was top billed in the British comedy &quot;Rooney&quot; (1958).

Fitzgerald was top billed in the Irish film &quot;Broth of a Boy&quot; (1959).

===Later years===
Fitzgerald never married. In Hollywood, he shared an apartment with his stand-in, Angus D. Taillon, who died in 1953. Fitzgerald returned to live in Dublin in 1959, where he lived at 2 Seafield Ave, Monkstown. In October that year, he underwent brain surgery. He appeared to recover, but in late 1960 he re-entered the hospital. He died, as William Joseph Shields, of a heart attack in St Patrick&#x27;s Hospital, James Street, on 4 January 1961.

Fitzgerald has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, for motion pictures at 6252 Hollywood Boulevard and for television at 7001 Hollywood Boulevard.

<text>None but the Lonely Heart is a 1944 American drama romance film which tells the story of a young Cockney drifter who returns home with no ambitions but finds that his family needs him. Adapted by Clifford Odets from the 1943 novel of the same title by Richard Llewellyn and directed by Odets, the film stars Cary Grant, Ethel Barrymore, and Barry Fitzgerald.

The title of the film is taken from Tchaikovsky&#x27;s song &quot;None but the Lonely Heart&quot;, which is featured in the background music.

==Plot==

Ernie Mott is a restless, independent, wandering Cockney with perfect pitch. On Armistice Day, Ernie visits the tomb of the Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey, which memorializes those who died in World War I, including his father. Ernie seeks a life where is neither &#x27;the hound nor the hare,&#x27; neither a victim or a thug. When he returns home, his mother Ma asks why he has returned after so long and gives him an ultimatum that he must stay home now or leave forever. He informs her that he will then be leaving next morning and goes out to get a drink. He meets fellow musician Aggie Hunter outside the bar, but instead prefers the company of a gangster&#x27;s fickle former wife, Ada Brantline. However, when Ernie becomes smitten with Ada, she rejects his offer of a date when he tells her he will be leaving town the next day.

The next morning, Ma tells her pawnbroker friend, Ike Weber, that she has cancer. Ma and Ernie get into another fight, but after he storms out, Ike shares with him that his mother needs him in her battle with cancer. Ernie returns and says that he will stay with her at home and help her run her shop.

A month passes, and Ernie continues to pursue Ada. However, when gangster Jim Mordinoy informs him that she is still his wife, Ernie does not believe Ada when she says that is a lie and he cuts her off socially. Ernie begins to notice the poverty surrounding him in London and chooses to accept Mordinoy&#x27;s offer to join his activities, even against Ada&#x27;s pleas. Ernie begins to steal cars, and he is involved in a police chase until his car collides with a truck and explodes into flames. Ada implores him to run away with her, but he does not want to leave his dying mother.

When Ernie is eventually bailed out of jail by Ike, he finds out that after the police discovered Ernie&#x27;s platinum cigarette case — his birthday gift from Ma — was stolen, the police arrested Ma and put her in prison. She begs for forgiveness for shaming the family and dies in prison hospital. When he returns home, he learns via a letter from Ada that she decided to stay with Mordinoy because that would make her life easier. Ernie is crushed and walks along the street until he gets to Aggie&#x27;s door and walks in.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;None but the Lonely Heart&quot;, &quot;Gunga Din&quot; (1939) and &quot;Sylvia Scarlett&quot; (1935) were the only films in which Cary Grant used a Cockney accent, though that was not his original accent. He was originally from Bristol.

RKO Pictures head Charles Koerner bought Richard Llewellyn&#x27;s book as a starring vehicle for Cary Grant. Koerner also suggested that playwright Clifford Odets direct the picture. This was the first feature film Odets directed, and he would direct only one other picture during his career, &quot;The Story on Page One&quot; (1959). To secure Ethel Barrymore&#x27;s availability to complete her scenes, RKO had to pay all the expenses incurred by temporarily closing the play &quot;The Corn Is Green&quot;, in which she was starring on Broadway.

According to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, the East End London road set in this film was the largest and most complete external set constructed inside a sound stage at that time. The set measured 800 feet long and extended the length of two sound stages.

==Reception==
Lela Rogers, the mother of Ginger Rogers, denounced the script of &quot;None but the Lonely Heart&quot; at a House Committee on Un-American Activities hearing as a &quot;perfect example of the propaganda that Communists like to inject&quot; and accused Odets of being a Communist. Rogers cited the line spoken by Ernie to his mother, &quot;you&#x27;re not going to get me to work here and squeeze pennies out of little people who are poorer than I am,&quot; as an example of Communist propaganda. Hanns Eisler, who was nominated for an Academy Award for composing the film&#x27;s score, was also interrogated by the House Committee on Un-American Activities and was designated as an unfriendly witness for his refusal to cooperate.

===Box office===
The film recorded a loss of $72,000.

<text>Alexander Knox (16 January 1907 – 25 April 1995) was a Canadian actor and writer. He appeared in over 100 film, television, and theatrical productions over a career spanning from the 1920s until the late 1980s. He was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe for his performance as American President Woodrow Wilson in the 1944 film &quot;Wilson&quot;. However, his career in the United States was hampered by McCarthyism, and he spent the rest of his career in the United Kingdom.

Knox portrayed Control in the 1979 BBC miniseries adaptation of John le Carre&#x27;s &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot;. He acted in such films as &quot;Europe &#x27;51&quot;, &quot;The Vikings&quot;, &quot;The Longest Day&quot;, &quot;The Damned&quot;, and &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot;. He often worked with director Joseph Losey, a fellow American blacklistee living in the UK.

Aside from his acting career, Knox was also an author, writing adventure novels set in the Great Lakes area during the 19th century as well as plays and detective novels.

==Life and career==
Knox was born in Strathroy, Ontario, where his father was the minister of the Presbyterian Church. He graduated from the University of Western Ontario. He moved to Boston, Massachusetts, to perform on stage with the Boston Repertory Theatre. After the company folded following the stock market crash of 1929, Knox returned to London, Ontario, where, for the next two years, he worked as a reporter for &quot;The London Advertiser&quot; before moving to London, England, where, during the 1930s, he appeared in several films. He also appeared in various roles at the Old Vic such as the Judge in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Geneva&quot;. Canadian novelist Robertson Davies described his performance thus: &quot;To this role he brought a dignity which did much to heighten the effect of the famous court-scene which makes up the third act...&quot;. In 1939, at the Malvern Festival, he acted in Shaw&#x27;s In Good King Charles&#x27;s Golden Days. His own play &quot;Old Master&quot; was also staged. He starred opposite Jessica Tandy in the 1940 Broadway production of &quot;Jupiter Laughs&quot; and as Friar Laurence in Romeo and Juliet with Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier. Then in 1944, he was chosen by Darryl F. Zanuck to star in &quot;Wilson&quot; (1944), the biographical film about American President Woodrow Wilson, for which he won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. However, during the McCarthy Era, his liberal views and work with the Committee for the First Amendment hurt his career, but he was not blacklisted, and he returned to Britain.

Knox had major roles in &quot;The Sea Wolf&quot; (1941), &quot;None Shall Escape&quot; (1944), &quot;Over 21&quot; (1945), &quot;Sister Kenny&quot; (1946), &quot;Man In The Saddle&quot; (1951), &quot;Paula&quot; (1952), &quot;Europa &#x27;51&quot; (1952), and &quot;The Vikings&quot; (1958), as well as supporting roles late in his career, such as in &quot;The Damned&quot; (1963), &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; (1966), &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; (1971), &quot;Joshua Then and Now&quot; (1985; his last film role) and the miniseries &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot;.

He depicted Governor Hudson Inverest in &quot;The Latin Touch&quot;, the second episode of the first season of &quot;The Saint&quot; in 1962.

=== Writing ===
He wrote several adventure novels: &quot;Bride of Quietness&quot; (1933), &quot;Night of the White Bear&quot; (1971), &quot;The Enemy I Kill&quot; (1972; republished as &quot;Totem Dream&quot; in 1973), &quot;Raider&#x27;s Moon&quot;, and &quot;The Kidnapped Surgeon&quot;. He also wrote plays and at least three detective novels under a pseudonym before 1945.

==Personal life==
Knox was married to American actress Doris Nolan (1916–1998) from 1944 until his death in 1995. They starred together in the 1949 Broadway play &quot;The Closing Door&quot;, which Knox also wrote. They had a son Andrew Joseph Knox (born 1947; died by suicide in 1987) who became an actor and appeared in &quot;Doctor on the Go&quot;, and who was married to Imogen Hassall.

Knox died in Berwick-upon-Tweed from bone cancer on April 25, 1995.

<text>Celebrimbor () is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium. In Tolkien&#x27;s stories, Celebrimbor was an elven-smith who was manipulated into forging the Rings of Power by the Dark Lord Sauron, in fair disguise and named &quot;Annatar&quot; (&quot;Lord of Gifts&quot;). Sauron then secretly made the One Ring to gain control over all the other Rings and dominate Middle-earth, setting in motion the events of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

Tolkien, as a professional philologist, had been asked to translate an inscription at the late Roman temple of Nodens at Lydney Park in Gloucestershire. The inscription recorded a curse upon a ring; the place was named &quot;Dwarf&#x27;s Hill&quot;; and he traced Nodens to an Irish hero, &quot;Nuada Airgetlám&quot;, &quot;Nuada of the Silver-Hand&quot;. This combination inspired him to create Celebrimbor (whose name means &quot;Silver-Hand&quot; in Tolkien&#x27;s invented language of Sindarin), dangerous Rings, and Dwarves skilled in craftsmanship and friendly to Celebrimbor as elements in his fantasy.

Celebrimbor appears in the 2014 video game &quot;Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor&quot; and its 2017 sequel, where he is voiced by Alastair Duncan. In the 2022 television show &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot;, he is played by Charles Edwards.

== Middle-earth narrative ==

Celebrimbor was the son of Curufin, one of the sons of Fëanor and Nerdanel; he was Fëanor&#x27;s only known grandchild. Fëanor was the most skilful craftsman of the First Age, forging the three Silmarils to capture some of the light of the Two Trees of Valinor. Celebrimbor followed his father and grandfather to Middle-earth, leaving his mother behind in Aman with Finarfin&#x27;s people. He repudiated his father when Celegorm and Curufin were driven out of Nargothrond. During the Second Age, Celebrimbor lived in the Elvish realm of Eregion and founded a brotherhood of jewel-smiths.

=== Dwarf-friend ===

From the early days of Eregion, Celebrimbor fostered the relationship with Khazad-dûm (Moria), the neighbouring Dwarf-kingdom. He became friends with Narvi, a great Dwarf-craftsman, and together they made the West-gate of Khazad-dûm. Celebrimbor&#x27;s special contribution was the inscriptions on the gateway.

=== Ring-maker ===

Later, someone naming himself &quot;Annatar&quot; arrived in Eregion. He appeared to be an Elf, and claimed he has been sent by the Valar to share his wisdom and skills in ring-craft and jewelry for the benefit of all Middle-earth; but in fact he was the Dark Lord Sauron in disguise. Annatar provided valuable and seemingly benevolent guidance and instruction to Celebrimbor and the smiths of Eregion, and they began making the Rings of Power for the rulers of Middle-earth—seven for the Dwarf-lords and nine for Men. Secretly, without Sauron&#x27;s knowledge, Celebrimbor also forged three Rings for the Elves, the greatest and fairest of the Rings of Power. The three Rings were thus free of Sauron&#x27;s corrupting influence.

At the same time, Sauron secretly forged a ring: the One Ring which would enable him to rule Middle-earth. Later Sauron reassumed his role as the Dark Lord and placed the One Ring on his finger, claiming dominion over all the Rings of Power and their bearers. Before this, Celebrimbor believed Sauron to be what he had claimed to be, but realising the truth he and the Elves of Eregion defied Sauron by withholding the other rings from him. He had already sent the three Rings away for safekeeping.

With his scheme exposed to the Elves, Sauron retaliated by attacking Eregion, initiating the War of the Elves and Sauron, and laying waste to the realm. Celebrimbor was captured in the sack of Eregion, and was forced under torture to disclose where the Nine and the Seven were held, but he would not reveal the whereabouts of the three Elvish Rings. Sauron captured the lesser rings and used them as instruments of evil in later years, particularly against Men. Celebrimbor died from his torment; his body, shot with arrows, was then hung upon a pole and used by Sauron&#x27;s forces like a banner on the battlefield.

=== Alternative backgrounds ===

Like Galadriel and Gil-galad, Celebrimbor first appeared as a character in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and then had to be inserted into &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, leading to multiple changes to his descent. In a c. 1968 version of the story, included in the essay &quot;Eldarin Hands, Fingers and Numerals&quot;, Celebrimbor was one of the Teleri of Aman, one of the three companions of Galadriel and Celeborn (here made into a Telerin prince &quot;Teleporno&quot; or &quot;Telporno&quot;). Christopher Tolkien noted that his father had mentioned Celebrimbor&#x27;s descent from Fëanor in the appendices to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and had underlined it in one of his personal copies, writing in the margin a note stating that Celebrimbor was Curufin&#x27;s son, and that if he had remembered this he would have felt bound to retain that version. A different version, in the late essay &quot;Of Dwarves and Men&quot;, has Celebrimbor as one of the Sindar who claimed descent from Daeron, and at one point, Celebrimbor was also one of the Noldor of Gondolin.

== House of Finwë ==

Celebrimbor was of the royal line of Finwë, high king of the Noldor, the elves especially skilled in craftwork who migrated to Valinor and lived in the blessed realm.

== Real-world origins ==

In 1928, a 4th-century pagan cult temple was excavated at Lydney Park, Gloucestershire. Tolkien was asked to investigate a Latin inscription there: &quot;For the god Nodens. Silvianus has lost a ring and has donated one-half [its worth] to Nodens. Among those who are called Senicianus do not allow health until he brings it to the temple of Nodens.&quot; An old name for the place was Dwarf&#x27;s Hill, and in 1932 Tolkien, a professional philologist, traced Nodens to the Irish hero &quot;Nuada Airgetlám&quot;, &quot;Nuada of the Silver-Hand&quot;.

The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey thought this &quot;a pivotal influence&quot; on Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth, combining as it did a god-hero, a ring, dwarves, and a silver hand. &quot;The J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot; states that Mathew Lyons noted the &quot;Hobbit-like appearance of [Dwarf&#x27;s Hill]&#x27;s mine-shaft holes&quot;, and that Tolkien was, according to the Lydney curator Sylvia Jones, extremely interested in the hill&#x27;s folklore on his stay there. It adds that Helen Armstrong commented that the place inspired &quot;Celebrimbor and the fallen realms of Moria and Eregion&quot;. The scholar of English literature John M. Bowers notes that Celebrimbor is the Sindarin for &quot;Silver Hand&quot;, and that &quot;because the place was known locally as Dwarf&#x27;s Hill and honeycombed with abandoned mines, it naturally suggested itself as background for the Lonely Mountain and the Mines of Moria.&quot;

== Adaptations ==

=== Video games ===

Celebrimbor appears in the 2014 video game &quot;Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor&quot; where he is voiced by Alastair Duncan. In order not simply to copy Peter Jackson&#x27;s films, the game&#x27;s makers Monolith Productions decided to combine a minor but significant Middle-earth character from &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, Celebrimbor, with an original character of their own invention, Talion. The game takes place sometime between the action of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; at which time Celebrimbor survives as an amnesiac wraith. After being bonded with Talion (a ranger of Gondor) the two become an immortal fighting team unable to leave Mordor. Over the game, Celebrimbor lends his abilities as a wraith to Talion, and the two recover Celebrimbor&#x27;s lost memories of Sauron and the forging of the Rings of Power: Sauron comes to Celebrimbor to give him a powerful hammer to forge the rings. Then Celebrimbor is betrayed by Sauron, forced to inscribe the incantation in the One Ring, and tortured and beaten to death by Sauron after an attempted coup. After the defeat of Sauron&#x27;s captains, Celebrimbor describes defeating Sauron himself as futile and wishes to depart for Valinor, but is convinced to stay by Talion; he then mentions his desire to forge a new Ring of Power immune to Sauron&#x27;s influence. This leads to the events of the 2017 sequel &quot;Middle-earth: Shadow of War&quot;, which reviewers described as &quot;fun, inventive, exciting—and totally non-canonical&quot;. In &quot;Shadow of War&quot;, Celebrimbor and Talion successfully forge a new Ring of Power that appears to be free of Sauron&#x27;s influence and is stated to be equal in power to the nine Rings of the Nazgûl without their corrupting influence. They use their new Ring to take the fight to Sauron with an army of Uruks, with Talion noticing Celebrimbor becoming more aggressive and worn out. Eventually revealed to fully intend to overthrow Sauron rather than destroy him, Celebrimbor ends his bond with Talion and possesses Eltariel to use her to defeat Sauron. Talion survives by becoming a Nazgûl, and Celebrimbor is defeated when forced out of Eltariel and is quickly absorbed by Sauron trapping both of them in the form of a large flaming eye on top of Barad-dûr. Celebrimbor remains trapped as part of the Dark Lord until the One Ring is destroyed, freeing the spirit as Sauron dies.

=== Other ===

&quot;Celebrimbor&#x27;s Secret&quot; is the title of an expansion, part of &quot;The Ring-maker Cycle&quot; series, for &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game&quot;, a non-collectible customizable card game produced by Fantasy Flight Games from 2011.

Celebrimbor is played by the English actor Charles Edwards in the television series &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot;, from 2022.

<doc id="145661" wikidata="Q190629" url="?curid=145661" title="Centralizer and normalizer">
<text>In mathematics, especially group theory, the centralizer (also called commutant) of a subset &quot;S&quot; in a group &quot;G&quot; is the set formula_1 of elements of &quot;G&quot; that commute with every element of &quot;S&quot;, or equivalently, the set of elements formula_2 such that conjugation by formula_3 leaves each element of &quot;S&quot; fixed. The normalizer of &quot;S&quot; in &quot;G&quot; is the set of elements formula_4 of &quot;G&quot; that satisfy the weaker condition of leaving the set formula_5 fixed under conjugation. The centralizer and normalizer of &quot;S&quot; are subgroups of &quot;G&quot;. Many techniques in group theory are based on studying the centralizers and normalizers of suitable subsets &quot;S&quot;.

Suitably formulated, the definitions also apply to semigroups.

In ring theory, the centralizer of a subset of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] is defined with respect to the multiplication of the ring (a semigroup operation). The centralizer of a subset of a ring &quot;R&quot; is a subring of &quot;R&quot;. This article also deals with centralizers and normalizers in a Lie algebra.

The idealizer in a semigroup or ring is another construction that is in the same vein as the centralizer and normalizer.

==Definitions==
===Group and semigroup===
The centralizer of a subset &quot;S&quot; of group (or semigroup) &quot;G&quot; is defined as

:formula_6

where only the first definition applies to semigroups.
If there is no ambiguity about the group in question, the &quot;G&quot; can be suppressed from the notation. When &quot;S&quot; = {&quot;a&quot;} is a singleton set, we write C&quot;G&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) instead of C&quot;G&quot;({&quot;a&quot;}). Another less common notation for the centralizer is Z(&quot;a&quot;), which parallels the notation for the center. With this latter notation, one must be careful to avoid confusion between the center of a group &quot;G&quot;, Z(&quot;G&quot;), and the &quot;centralizer&quot; of an &quot;element&quot; &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, Z(&quot;g&quot;).

The normalizer of &quot;S&quot; in the group (or semigroup) &quot;G&quot; is defined as

:formula_7

where again only the first definition applies to semigroups. If the set formula_8 is a subgroup of formula_9, then the normalizer formula_10 is the largest subgroup formula_11 where formula_8 is a normal subgroup of formula_13. The definitions of &quot;centralizer&quot; and &quot;normalizer&quot; are similar but not identical. If &quot;g&quot; is in the centralizer of &quot;S&quot; and &quot;s&quot; is in &quot;S&quot;, then it must be that , but if &quot;g&quot; is in the normalizer, then for some &quot;t&quot; in &quot;S&quot;, with &quot;t&quot; possibly different from &quot;s&quot;. That is, elements of the centralizer of &quot;S&quot; must commute pointwise with &quot;S&quot;, but elements of the normalizer of &quot;S&quot; need only commute with &quot;S as a set&quot;. The same notational conventions mentioned above for centralizers also apply to normalizers. The normalizer should not be confused with the normal closure.

Clearly formula_14 and both are subgroups of formula_9.

===Ring, algebra over a field, Lie ring, and Lie algebra===
If &quot;R&quot; is a ring or an algebra over a field, and &quot;S&quot; is a subset of &quot;R&quot;, then the centralizer of &quot;S&quot; is exactly as defined for groups, with &quot;R&quot; in the place of &quot;G&quot;.

If formula_16 is a Lie algebra (or Lie ring) with Lie product [&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;], then the centralizer of a subset &quot;S&quot; of formula_16 is defined to be

:formula_18
The definition of centralizers for Lie rings is linked to the definition for rings in the following way. If &quot;R&quot; is an associative ring, then &quot;R&quot; can be given the bracket product . Of course then if and only if . If we denote the set &quot;R&quot; with the bracket product as L&quot;R&quot;, then clearly the &quot;ring centralizer&quot; of &quot;S&quot; in &quot;R&quot; is equal to the &quot;Lie ring centralizer&quot; of &quot;S&quot; in L&quot;R&quot;.

The normalizer of a subset &quot;S&quot; of a Lie algebra (or Lie ring) formula_16 is given by
:formula_20
While this is the standard usage of the term &quot;normalizer&quot; in Lie algebra, this construction is actually the idealizer of the set &quot;S&quot; in formula_16. If &quot;S&quot; is an additive subgroup of formula_16, then formula_23 is the largest Lie subring (or Lie subalgebra, as the case may be) in which &quot;S&quot; is a Lie ideal.

==Example==
Consider the group 
:formula_24 (the symmetric group of permutations of 3 elements).

Take a subset H of the group G: 

:formula_25

Note that [1, 2, 3] is the identity permutation in G and retains the order of each element and [1, 3, 2] is the permutation that fixes the first element and swaps the second and third element.

The normalizer of H with respect to the group G are all elements of G that yield the set H (potentially permuted) when the element conjugates H.
Working out the example for each element of G:

:formula_26 when applied to formula_27: formula_28; therefore [1, 2, 3] is in the Normalizer(H) with respect to G.
:formula_29 when applied to formula_27: formula_28; therefore [1, 3, 2] is in the Normalizer(H) with respect to G.
:formula_32 when applied to formula_27: formula_34; therefore [2, 1, 3] is not in the Normalizer(H) with respect to G.
:formula_35 when applied to formula_27: formula_37; therefore [2, 3, 1] is not in the Normalizer(H) with respect to G.
:formula_38 when applied to formula_27: formula_34; therefore [3, 1, 2] is not in the Normalizer(H) with respect to G.
:formula_41 when applied to formula_27: formula_37; therefore [3, 2, 1] is not in the Normalizer(H) with respect to G.

Therefore, the Normalizer(H) with respect to G is formula_44 since both these group elements preserve the set H under conjugation.

The centralizer of the group G is the set of elements that leave each element of H unchanged by conjugation; that is, the set of elements that commutes with every element in H. 
It&#x27;s clear in this example that the only such element in S3 is H itself ([1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2]).

===Semigroups===
Let formula_45 denote the centralizer of formula_8 in the semigroup formula_47; i.e. formula_48 Then formula_45 forms a subsemigroup and formula_50; i.e. a commutant is its own bicommutant.

===Groups===
Source:
* The centralizer and normalizer of &quot;S&quot; are both subgroups of &quot;G&quot;.
* Clearly, . In fact, C&quot;G&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) is always a normal subgroup of N&quot;G&quot;(&quot;S&quot;), being the kernel of the homomorphism and the group N&quot;G&quot;(&quot;S&quot;)/C&quot;G&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) acts by conjugation as a group of bijections on &quot;S&quot;. E.g. the Weyl group of a compact Lie group &quot;G&quot; with a torus &quot;T&quot; is defined as , and especially if the torus is maximal (i.e. it is a central tool in the theory of Lie groups. 
* C&quot;G&quot;(C&quot;G&quot;(&quot;S&quot;)) contains &quot;S&quot;, but C&quot;G&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) need not contain &quot;S&quot;. Containment occurs exactly when &quot;S&quot; is abelian.
* If &quot;H&quot; is a subgroup of &quot;G&quot;, then N&quot;G&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) contains &quot;H&quot;.
* If &quot;H&quot; is a subgroup of &quot;G&quot;, then the largest subgroup of &quot;G&quot; in which &quot;H&quot; is normal is the subgroup N&quot;G&quot;(H).
* If &quot;S&quot; is a subset of &quot;G&quot; such that all elements of &quot;S&quot; commute with each other, then the largest subgroup of &quot;G&quot; whose center contains &quot;S&quot; is the subgroup C&quot;G&quot;(S).
* A subgroup &quot;H&quot; of a group &quot;G&quot; is called a of &quot;G&quot; if .
* The center of &quot;G&quot; is exactly C&quot;G&quot;(G) and &quot;G&quot; is an abelian group if and only if .
* For singleton sets, .
* By symmetry, if &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are two subsets of &quot;G&quot;, if and only if .
* For a subgroup &quot;H&quot; of group &quot;G&quot;, the N/C theorem states that the factor group N&quot;G&quot;(&quot;H&quot;)/C&quot;G&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) is isomorphic to a subgroup of Aut(&quot;H&quot;), the group of automorphisms of &quot;H&quot;. Since and , the N/C theorem also implies that &quot;G&quot;/Z(&quot;G&quot;) is isomorphic to Inn(&quot;G&quot;), the subgroup of Aut(&quot;G&quot;) consisting of all inner automorphisms of &quot;G&quot;.
* If we define a group homomorphism by , then we can describe N&quot;G&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) and C&quot;G&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) in terms of the group action of Inn(&quot;G&quot;) on &quot;G&quot;: the stabilizer of &quot;S&quot; in Inn(&quot;G&quot;) is &quot;T&quot;(N&quot;G&quot;(&quot;S&quot;)), and the subgroup of Inn(&quot;G&quot;) fixing &quot;S&quot; pointwise is &quot;T&quot;(C&quot;G&quot;(&quot;S&quot;)).
* A subgroup &quot;H&quot; of a group &quot;G&quot; is said to be C-closed or self-bicommutant if for some subset . If so, then in fact, .

===Rings and algebras over a field===
Source:
* Centralizers in rings and in algebras over a field are subrings and subalgebras over a field, respectively; centralizers in Lie rings and in Lie algebras are Lie subrings and Lie subalgebras, respectively.
* The normalizer of &quot;S&quot; in a Lie ring contains the centralizer of &quot;S&quot;.
* C&quot;R&quot;(C&quot;R&quot;(&quot;S&quot;)) contains &quot;S&quot; but is not necessarily equal. The double centralizer theorem deals with situations where equality occurs.
* If &quot;S&quot; is an additive subgroup of a Lie ring &quot;A&quot;, then N&quot;A&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) is the largest Lie subring of &quot;A&quot; in which &quot;S&quot; is a Lie ideal.

<text>Elendil () is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium. He is mentioned in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;. He was the father of Isildur and Anárion, last lord of Andúnië on the island of Númenor, and having escaped its downfall by sailing to Middle-earth, became the first High King of Arnor and Gondor. In the Last Alliance of Men and Elves, Elendil and Gil-galad laid siege to the Dark Lord Sauron&#x27;s fortress of Barad-dûr, and fought him hand-to-hand for the One Ring. Both Elendil and Gil-galad were killed, and Elendil&#x27;s son Isildur took the Ring for himself.

Tolkien called Elendil a &quot;Noachian figure&quot;, an echo of the biblical Noah. Elendil escaped from the flood that drowned Númenor, itself an echo of the myth of Atlantis, founding new Númenórean kingdoms in Middle-earth.

==Fictional history==

=== Biography ===

Elendil was born in Númenor, son of Amandil, Lord of Andúnië and leader of the &quot;Faithful&quot; (those who remained loyal to the Valar), who maintained a strong friendship with the Elves and preserved the old ways against the practices of king Ar-Pharazôn and Sauron. His father Amandil had been a great admiral of the Númenórean fleet and a close friend to Ar-Pharazôn in their youth, but as Sauron&#x27;s influence grew, he resorted to doing what their ancestor Eärendil had done: sailing to Valinor and asking for the pardon of the Valar. Amandil was never heard of again, but on his urging, Elendil, his sons Isildur and Anárion, and their supporters fled the downfall of Númenor at the end of the Second Age, escaping to Middle-earth in nine ships. Elendil landed in Lindon, where he was befriended by Gil-galad, the Elven King. The waves carried Isildur and Anárion south to the Bay of Belfalas and the mouth of the River Anduin. With them the leaders took the &quot;palantíri&quot;, the &quot;Seeing Stones&quot; that were given to the Lords of Andúnië by the Elves of Tol Eressëa, and a seedling of Nimloth, the White Tree of Númenor.

&quot;Unfinished Tales&quot; states that, upon landing in Middle-earth, Elendil proclaimed in Quenya: &quot;Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come. In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.&quot; His heir and 40th generation descendant in father-to-son line Aragorn spoke these traditional words again when he took up the crown of Gondor in &quot;The Return of the King&quot;.

Elendil founded the northern realm of Arnor and its capital city of Annúminas. His sons founded the southern realm of Gondor; Anárion founded the city of Minas Anor (later Minas Tirith) in Anórien, and Isildur founded Minas Ithil (later Minas Morgul) in Ithilien. Elendil was the High King, ruling directly over Arnor and indirectly over Gondor, via its King.

As explained in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, Sauron eventually returned to Middle-earth, establishing a stronghold in Mordor, which was next to Gondor. He attacked, seizing Minas Ithil. Isildur fled north to his father, leaving Anárion in charge of Gondor. Elendil and Isildur returned south, together with Gil-galad and their combined armies, in the Last Alliance of Elves and Men. They defeated Sauron in the Battle of Dagorlad, and laid siege to his stronghold of Barad-dûr. During this long siege Anárion was killed. Finally, Sauron came out personally to do battle. Gil-galad and Elendil fought him, but both were killed, and Elendil&#x27;s sword was broken beneath him. Isildur used his father&#x27;s broken sword to cut the One Ring from Sauron&#x27;s hand.

=== Line of the Half-elven ===
== Analysis ==

=== Biblical echoes ===

Nicholas Birns, a scholar of literature, notes Elendil&#x27;s survival of Númenor&#x27;s fall, an event that recalls to him both Plato&#x27;s Atlantis and the Biblical fall of man; he notes that Tolkien called Elendil a &quot;Noachian figure&quot;, an echo of the biblical Noah. Tolkien explains that Elendil &quot;held off&quot; from the Númenórean rebellion, and had kept ships ready; he &quot;flees before the overwhelming storm of the wrath of the West [from Valinor], and is borne high upon the towering waves that bring ruin to the west of the Middle-earth.&quot; Birns notes that Elendil, who he calls a hugely important figure in Middle-earth, must be later &quot;in comparative time&quot; than Noah; where Noah was a refugee, Elendil was &quot;an imperialist, a founder of realms&quot;. However, he grants that &quot;Noachian&quot; implies a class of people like Noah, and the possibility of different kinds of flood. Birns comments that Middle-earth has its Creation and Flood myths, but not exactly a fall of man. He suggests that Tolkien, as a Catholic, may have been more comfortable working with the forces of nature seen in Creation and Flood, but preferred to leave the fall alone; he notes that both Creation and Flood are found in non-Christian tales from the Middle East, citing the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; for the Flood and the Enuma Elish for Creation.

The priest and Tolkien scholar Fleming Rutledge writes that Aragorn, narrating the Lay of Beren and Lúthien to the hobbits, tells them that Lúthien&#x27;s line &quot;shall never fail&quot;. Rutledge talks of the &quot;kings of Númenor, that is Westernesse&quot;, and as they gaze at him, they see that the moon &quot;climbs behind him as if to crown him&quot;, which Rutledge calls an echo of the Transfiguration. Rutledge explains that Aragorn is of the line of Elendil and knows he will inherit &quot;the crown of Elendil and the other Kings of vanished Númenor&quot;, just as Jesus is of the line of King David, fulfilling the prophecy that the line of Kings would not fail.

Zak Cramer notes in &quot;Mallorn&quot; that Tolkien&#x27;s middle name, Reuel, means &quot;God&#x27;s friend&quot;, and could be written &quot;El&#x27;s friend&quot; with reference to the Hebrew word for &quot;God&quot;. He speculates that Elendil, &quot;Elf-friend&quot;, may have been a wordplay on this name.

=== Classical echoes ===
The classical scholar J. K. Newman compares the myth of Elendil and the defeat of Sauron with Jason&#x27;s taking of the Golden Fleece. In both, a golden prize is taken; in both, there are evil consequences – Elendil&#x27;s son Isildur is betrayed and the Ring is lost, leading to the War of the Ring and Frodo&#x27;s quest; Medea murders Jason&#x27;s children.

=== Germanic echoes ===
Tolkien wrote in a 1964 letter that the story of Elendil began when C. S. Lewis and he agreed to write a space travel and a time travel story, respectively. Tolkien&#x27;s tale was to be called &quot;Númenor, the Land in the West&quot;, with repeated father–son pairs whose names meant &quot;Bliss-friend&quot; and &quot;Elf-friend&quot; each time. It was not completed, but survives as two unfinished time-travel novels, &quot;The Lost Road&quot; and &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot;. The Elf-friends were to be Elwin in present time; Ælfwine (Old English) around 918 AD; Alboin from &quot;Lombardic legend&quot;; and eventually Elendil of Númenor. Tolkien states that he lost interest in the others, and focussed on Elendil, whose story he incorporated into his &quot;main mythology&quot;. One of Tolkien&#x27;s correspondents, the scholar of English, Rhona Beare, writes in &quot;Mythlore&quot; that Elendil is a &quot;remote ancestor&quot; of Alboin; when Alboin travels back in time he finds Númenor simultaneously familiar and strange, because he can see it both with Elendil&#x27;s eyes and with his own.

== Adaptations ==
In Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, Elendil is portrayed by Peter McKenzie. He appears briefly in the prologue, where he is killed by Sauron. The action differs from the book, where Gil-galad and Elendil heroically defeated Sauron, at the cost of their own lives, allowing Isildur to take the Ring without difficulty. In the film, Sauron defeats Elendil, and Isildur fights Sauron, the action of cutting off his finger and the Ring serving to vanquish Sauron. Tolkien instructed that &quot;Sauron should not be thought of as very terrible. The form that he took was that of a more than human stature, but not gigantic&quot;, though he &quot;could appear as a commanding figure of great strength of body and supremely royal demeanor and countenance.&quot; Jackson chooses to make Sauron much larger than Elendil for his final battle. The scholar of English literature Robert Tally comments that it is ironic that Jackson may have come closest to Tolkien&#x27;s intentions in the prologue by representing Sauron in humanoid form, while he is a disembodied eye everywhere else in the film series.

In the 2022 television series, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot;, Elendil is played by Lloyd Owen. The show introduces Elendil as a Númenórean nobleman, who serves as a sea captain. He is a widower with three adult children: sons Isildur and Anárion, and a daughter Eärien.

<doc id="145663" wikidata="Q165394" url="?curid=145663" title="Bowling for Columbine">
<text>Bowling for Columbine is a 2002 documentary film written, produced, directed, and narrated by Michael Moore. The documentary film explores what Moore suggests are the primary causes for the Columbine High School massacre in 1999 and other acts of gun violence. He focuses on the background and environment in which the massacre took place and some common public opinions and assumptions about related issues. The film also looks into the nature of violence in the United States, and American violence abroad.

A critical and commercial success, the film brought Moore international attention as a rising filmmaker and won numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary Feature, a special &quot;55th Anniversary Prize&quot; at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival, and the César Award for Best Foreign Film. The film is widely considered one of the greatest documentary films of all time.

==Film content==
In Moore&#x27;s discussions with various people—including &quot;South Park&quot; co-creator Matt Stone, the National Rifle Association&#x27;s president Charlton Heston, Oklahoma City bombing suspect James Nichols, and musician Marilyn Manson—he seeks to explain why the Columbine massacre occurred and why the United States&#x27; violent crime rate (especially concerning crimes committed with firearms) is substantially higher than those of other nations. 

===Bowling===
The film&#x27;s title refers to the story that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold—the two students responsible for the Columbine High School massacre—attended a school bowling class at 6:00 AM on the day they committed the attacks at school, that commenced at 11:17 AM. Later investigations showed that this was based on mistaken recollections, and Glenn Moore of the Golden Police Department concluded that they were absent from school on the day the attack took place.

Moore also incorporates the concept of recreational bowling into the film in other ways. For example, the Michigan Militia use bowling pins for their target practice. When interviewing former classmates of the two boys, Moore notes that the students took a bowling class instead of physical education. He suggests that this might have very little educational value and the people he interviews generally agree, noting how Harris and Klebold led introverted lifestyles and had careless attitudes towards the game, and that nobody thought twice about it. Moore questions whether the school system is responding to the real needs of students or if they are reinforcing fear. Moore also interviews two young residents of Oscoda, Michigan. Moore suggests a culture of fear created by the government and the media leads Americans to arm themselves, to the advantage of gun-making companies. Moore suggests that bowling could have been just as responsible for the attacks on the school as Marilyn Manson, or even President Bill Clinton, who launched bombing attacks on Serbia at the time.

===Free gun for opening a bank account===

An early scene depicts a bank in northern Michigan that gives customers a free hunting rifle when they make a deposit of a certain size into a time deposit account. The film follows Moore as he goes to the bank, makes his deposit, fills out the forms, and awaits the result of a background check before walking out of the bank carrying a brand new Weatherby hunting rifle. Just before leaving the bank, Moore asks: &quot;Do you think it&#x27;s a little dangerous handing out guns at a bank?&quot;

The &quot;Boston Review&quot; called this scene a fabrication,

Similarly, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; called the scene &quot;staged&quot;.

===&quot;Happiness Is a Warm Gun&quot; montage===
About 20 minutes into the film, the Beatles song &quot;Happiness Is a Warm Gun&quot; plays during a montage in which footage of the following is shown:

* People buying guns
* Residents of Virgin, Utah, a town that passed a law requiring all residents to own guns
* People firing rifles at carnivals and shooting ranges
* Denise Ames operating a rifle
* Carey McWilliams, a blind gun enthusiast from Fargo, North Dakota
* Gary Plauché killing Jeff Doucet, who had kidnapped and sexual abused Plauché&#x27;s son
* The suicide of R. Budd Dwyer
* A 1993 murder where Emilio Nuñez shot and killed his ex-wife Maritza Martin during an interview on the Telemundo program &quot;Ocurrió Así&quot;
* The suicide of Daniel V. Jones, an AIDS and cancer patient who was protesting health maintenance organizations
* A man who takes his shirt off and is shot during a riot

===Weapons of mass destruction===
Early in the film, Moore links the violent behavior of the Columbine shooters to the presence of a large defense establishment manufacturing rocket technology in Littleton. It is implied that the presence of this facility within the community, and the acceptance of institutionalized violence as a solution to conflict, contributed to the mindset that led to the massacre.

Moore conducts an interview with Evan McCollum, Director of Communications at a Lockheed Martin plant near Columbine, and asks him:

McCollum responds:

After the release of the film, McCollum clarified that the plant no longer produces missiles (the plant manufactured parts for intercontinental ballistic missiles with a nuclear warhead in the mid-1980s), but rockets used for launching satellites:

===&quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; montage===
The film cuts to a montage of American foreign policy decisions, with the intent to counter McCollum&#x27;s statement by citing examples of how the United States has frequently been the aggressor nation. This montage is set to the song &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot;, performed by Louis Armstrong.

The following is a transcript of the onscreen text in the &quot;Wonderful World&quot; segment:

# 1953: U.S. overthrows Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh of Iran. U.S. installs Shah Pahlavi as absolute monarch.
# 1954: U.S. overthrows democratically elected President Jacobo Árbenz of Guatemala as part of a conflict that resulted in up to 200,000 civilians killed.

# 2000–01: U.S. gives Taliban-ruled Afghanistan $245 million in aid.

The montage ends with handheld-camera footage of United Airlines Flight 175 crashing into the South Tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, the audio consisting solely of the emotional reactions of the witnesses, recorded by the camera&#x27;s microphone. On the website accompanying the film, Moore provides additional background information for this section.

===Climate of fear===
Moore contrasts his portrayal of the U.S. attitude toward guns and violence with the attitude prevailing in areas of Canada where gun ownership is at similar levels to the U.S. He illustrates his thesis by visiting neighborhoods in Canada near the Canada–U.S. border, where he finds front doors unlocked and much less concern over crime and security. In regards to the film, Farber states &quot;Moore&#x27;s thesis, which he later elaborated in &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;, is that the fear-mongering that permeates American society contributes to our epidemic of gun violence&quot;. Moore shows news stories in Canada which do not follow the &quot;if it bleeds it leads&quot; mentality. This adds to Moore&#x27;s argument that the media is driving America&#x27;s fear and their need for protection. The cartoon &quot;A Brief History of the United States of America&quot; encompasses Moore&#x27;s view of where the fear in America started and how it has progressed and changed over the years.

In this section, there is a montage of several social pundits stating possible causes for gun violence. Many claim links with violence in television, cinema, and video games; towards the end of the montage, however, the same people all change their claims to Marilyn Manson&#x27;s responsibility. Following this is an interview between Moore and Marilyn Manson. Manson shares his views about the United States&#x27; climate with Moore, stating that he believes U.S. society is based on &quot;fear and consumption&quot;, citing Colgate commercials that promise &quot;if you have bad breath, [people] are not going to talk to you&quot; and other commercials containing fear-based messages. Manson also mentions that the media, under heavy government influence, had asserted that his influence on the acts of Klebold and Harris was far greater than that of President Clinton, who ordered more bombings on Kosovo on April 20, 1999, than any other day during the NATO campaign against Yugoslavia. When Moore asks Manson what he would say to the students at Columbine, Manson replies, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say a single word to them; I would listen to what they have to say, and that&#x27;s what no one did.&quot;

&quot;South Park&quot; co-creator Matt Stone—who grew up in Littleton—agreed to talk with Moore about his hometown and the shooting in the film. Although he did not feel that Moore mischaracterized him or his statements in the film, he harbored ill feelings about the cartoon &quot;A Brief History of the United States of America&quot;. Both Stone and his fellow &quot;South Park&quot; creator Trey Parker felt that the cartoon was done in a style very similar to theirs, and its proximity to Stone&#x27;s interview may have led viewers to believe that they created the cartoon. &quot;It was a good lesson in what Michael Moore does in films. He doesn&#x27;t necessarily say explicitly this is what it is, but he creates meaning where there is none by cutting things together,&quot; Stone remarked in a later interview. As a humorous retort to this, Stone and Parker portrayed Moore as &quot;a gibbering, overweight, hot-dog-eating buffoon&quot; who ultimately commits a suicide bombing against the protagonists in their 2004 film, &quot;Team America: World Police&quot;.

===Statistics===
Moore follows up by exploring popular explanations as to why gun violence is so high in the United States. He examines Marilyn Manson as a cause, but states that more German citizens listen to Marilyn Manson (per capita) and that the country has a larger Goth population than the United States, with less gun violence (Germany: 381 incidents per year). He examines violent movies, but notes that other countries have the same violent movies, showing &quot;The Matrix&quot; with French subtitles (France: 255 incidents per year). He also examines video games, but observes that many violent video games come from Japan (Japan: 39 incidents per year). He concludes his comparisons by considering the suggestion that the United States&#x27; violent history is the cause, but notes the similarly violent histories of Germany, Japan, France, and the United Kingdom (68 incidents per year). Moore ends this segment with gun-related-deaths-per-year statistics of the following countries:

* Japan: 39 (0.030/100,000)
* Australia: 65 (0.292/100,000)
* United Kingdom: 68 (0.109/100,000)
* Canada: 165 (0.484/100,000)
* France: 255 (0.389/100,000)
* Germany: 381 (0.466/100,000)
* United States: 11,127 (3.601/100,000)

&quot;The American Prospect&quot; published a piece by Garance Franke-Ruta criticizing the film for ignoring the role that municipal governance plays in crime in the United States, and ignoring African-American urban victims of violence while focusing on the unusual events of Columbine. &quot;A decline in murders in New York City alone—from 1,927 in 1993 to 643 in 2001—had, for example, a considerable impact on the declining national rate. Not a lot of those killers or victims were the sort of sports-hunters or militiamen Moore goes out of his way to interview and make fun of.&quot;

===Kmart refund===
Moore takes two Columbine survivors, Mark Taylor and Richard Castaldo (along with Brooks Brown, who remains unidentified during the segment), to the Troy, Michigan headquarters of American superstore Kmart to claim a refund on the bullets still lodged in their bodies, which were purchased by the perpetrators at a Kmart store. Moore and the victims wait for hours in the building&#x27;s lobby, speaking to several Kmart employees, who evade the issue. Moore then decides to visit a Kmart in nearby Sterling Heights, where they purchase the store&#x27;s entire supply of ammunition, and the three return to the company&#x27;s headquarters the following day with several members of the local media. The company&#x27;s vice president of communications is quickly sent down to address Moore and the press, and announces that the company will phase out handgun ammunition sales within 90 days. &quot;We&#x27;ve won,&quot; says Moore, in disbelief. &quot;That was more than we asked for.&quot;

===Charlton Heston interview===
For the final scene of the film, Moore visits Charlton Heston&#x27;s home and asks to speak to him via the speakerbox in front of his gated home. Heston declines to speak to him at the time, but agrees to look at his schedule for the next day. Moore returns and first shows his NRA card, which Heston expresses pleasure at. They go inside the large property and sit down to discuss American firearm violence. Heston&#x27;s response includes the suggestions that the United States has a &quot;history of violence&quot; and more &quot;mixed ethnicity&quot; than other countries. He also states that he does not believe that the United States is any more violent than other countries. Moore then asks Heston if he would like to apologize for leading NRA rallies in Flint, Michigan (Moore&#x27;s hometown) after the shooting death of a six-year-old girl at Buell Elementary School and in Littleton after the Columbine shooting. Heston claims he did not know about the girl&#x27;s death or how soon the rally was after it. When Moore presses to know if he would have cancelled the rally, he declines to answer and walks out of the interview. Moore implores him not to leave and asks him to look at a picture of the girl. Heston turns around, but then turns back to continue his exit. Upon his exit, Moore leaves the picture outside the home. Moore was later criticized by some for his perceived &quot;ambush&quot; of the actor. Heston later announced he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

&quot;I&#x27;m uncomfortable watching the scene now, and I&#x27;m uncomfortable sitting there with him,&quot; Moore told &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;″s Katey Rich in 2019. &quot;But I wasn&#x27;t going to not put it in the film either. He revealed his core beliefs. But I remember feeling kind of sad about it later. Here&#x27;s a man who 40 years prior to that marched with Martin Luther King, and now in his elderly years had just turned into this angry white guy who believed that we should have these laws where it&#x27;s O.K. to shoot first and ask questions later.&quot;

===Dedication===
The film is dedicated to the memory of three people who all died in gun related circumstances:

* John Alberts, a sound designer and mixer for much of Moore&#x27;s work. He had initially been hired to do the sound work on the film, but killed himself with a gun in January 2001.
* Herbert &quot;Sluggo&quot; Cleaves Jr., the oldest child of two of Moore&#x27;s closest friends. He was shot in the stomach in a drive-by shooting and died at an area hospital in February 2001.
* Laura Wilcox, a victim of handgun violence who was killed in the 2001 Nevada County shootings. Her death led to the implementation of Laura&#x27;s Law, which allows compulsory treatment of patients with violent psychiatric disorders.

==Release==

===Critical reception===
The film earned positive reviews from critics. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 95% approval rating based on 173 reviews, with an average rating of 8.20/10. The consensus states, &quot;Though it may not always convince, &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; asks important questions and provokes thought.&quot; Another score aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating in the 0–100 range based on reviews from top mainstream critics, calculated a score of 72 based on 32 reviews, signifying &#x27;generally favorable reviews&#x27;.

Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s unnerving, stimulating, likely to provoke anger and sorrow on both political sides—and, above all, it&#x27;s extremely funny.&quot; A.O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The slippery logic, tendentious grandstanding, and outright demagoguery on display in &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; should be enough to give pause to its most ardent partisans, while its disquieting insights into the culture of violence in America should occasion sober reflection from those who would prefer to stop their ears.&quot;

However, the film had its detractors as Desson Thomson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; thought that the film lacked a coherent message, asking &quot;A lot of this is amusing and somehow telling. There was a parody of this movie called &#x27;Bowling for Midway&#x27;, a conservative Utah family movie to counter Moore&#x27;s movie, and this paralleled the Docudrama, &#x27;This Divided State&#x27;. But what does it all add up to?&quot;

===MPAA rating===
The film was rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America, which means that children under the age of 17 were not admitted to see the film theatrically unless under supervision. Film critic Roger Ebert chastized the MPAA for this move as &quot;banning teenagers from those films they most need to see&quot;. Ebert had criticized the MPAA rating system on previous occasions. The film was noted for &quot;some violent images and language&quot;.

===Gross revenue===
With a budget of $4 million, &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; grossed $58,008,423 worldwide, including $21,576,018 in the United States. The documentary also broke box office records internationally, becoming the highest-grossing documentary in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Austria. These records were later eclipsed by Moore&#x27;s next documentary, &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;.

==Awards and nominations==
* 2002 Winner, 55th Anniversary Prize, 2002 Cannes Film Festival
* 2002 Winner, VPRO IDFA Audience Award, International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam
* 2003 Winner, César Awards, Best Foreign Film
* 2003 Winner, International Documentary Association (IDA) - Best Documentary of All Time
* 2003 Winner, Academy Award, Best Documentary Feature

During the screening at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival the film received a 13-minute standing ovation. It also won &quot;Most Popular International Film&quot; at the 2002 Vancouver International Film Festival.

Moore was both applauded and booed at the Academy Awards on March 23, 2003, when he used his acceptance speech as an opportunity to proclaim his opposition to the presidency of George W. Bush and the United States-led invasion of Iraq, which had begun just a few days earlier.

In 2005, it was voted the third most popular film in the British Channel 4 program &quot;The 50 Greatest Documentaries&quot; of all time.

==Home media==
&quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; was released on VHS and DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on August 19, 2003. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in a digital restoration with supplementary features by the Criterion Collection in June 2018.

<text>Stata Center, officially the Ray and Maria Stata Center and sometimes referred to as Building 32, is a 430,000-square-foot (40,000 m2) academic complex designed by architect Frank Gehry for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The building opened for initial occupancy on March 16, 2004. It is located on the site of MIT&#x27;s former Building 20, which had housed the historic MIT Radiation Laboratory, at 32 Vassar Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Description==
In contrast to the MIT custom of referring to buildings by their numbers rather than their official names, the complex is usually referred to as &quot;Stata&quot; or &quot;the Stata Center&quot; (though the building number is still essential in identifying rooms at MIT). Above the fourth floor, the building splits into two distinct structures: the Gates Tower and the Dreyfoos Tower, often called &quot;G Tower&quot; and &quot;D Tower&quot; respectively.

The building has a number of small auditoriums and classrooms used by the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department (EECS, Course 6), as well as other departments and on-campus groups. Research labs and offices of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS), as well as the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy (Course 24) occupy the upper floors. Academic celebrities such as Noam Chomsky, Ron Rivest, and World Wide Web Consortium founder Tim Berners-Lee also have offices in the building.

A wide main passage running the length of the building on the ground floor is called the Charles M. Vest Student Street, in honor of the former MIT president who died in December 2013. The Student Street is often used as a more-spacious substitute or extension for the Memorial Lobby located in Building 10 on the Infinite Corridor. The monthly &quot;Choose to Re-use&quot; community recycling swap fest, and a weekly fresh produce market are other events regularly held in the Stata Center. One of five MIT Technology Childcare Centers (TCC) is located at the western end of the ground floor. The Forbes Family Cafe is located at the eastern end, and serves coffee and lunch to the public during office hours.

The MIT Museum maintains some historic displays on the ground floor of the Stata Center. A few selected larger relics of past hacks (student pranks) are now on semi-permanent display, including a &quot;fire hose&quot; drinking fountain, a giant slide rule, and full-size replicas of a cow and a police car that had been placed atop the Great Dome (though not at the same time). In the ground floor elevator lobby of the Dreyfoos Tower are located a large time capsule box plus informational panels describing MIT&#x27;s historic Building 20, which the Stata Center has replaced.

A large Digi-Comp II mechanical digital computer which operates with billiard balls is located in the ground floor elevator lobby of the Gates Tower. Also located there is &quot;Flow&quot;, a large multicolor art display created by Karl Sims (an MIT alumnus and MacArthur &quot;genius&quot;), which is activated by visitors&#x27; movements as detected by a Microsoft Kinect sensor.

Major funding for the Stata Center was provided by Ray Stata (MIT class of 1957) and Maria Stata. Bill Gates donated US$20 million, causing MIT to name one tower the &quot;Gates Building.&quot; Other major funders included Alexander W. Dreyfoos Jr. (MIT class of 1954), Charles Thomas &quot;E.B.&quot; Pritchard Hintze (an MIT graduate, and of JD Edwards, now Oracle Corporation), Morris Chang of TSMC. and Michael Dertouzos.

==History==

The Stata Center is located on the site of the former Building 20, demolished in 1998. Building 20 had been erected hastily during World War II as a temporary building to house the historic Radiation Laboratory. Over the course of 55 years, its &quot;temporary&quot; nature allowed research groups to have more space, and to make more creative use of that space, than was possible in more respectable buildings. The building also provided permanent rooms for official Institute clubs and groups, including the Tech Model Railroad Club and the MIT Electronic Research Society (MITERS).

Professor Jerome Y. Lettvin once quipped, &quot;You might regard it as the womb of the Institute. It is kind of messy, but by God it is procreative!&quot;

== Architectural criticism ==
Robert Campbell, architecture columnist for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, wrote a glowing appraisal of the building on April 25, 2004. According to Campbell, &quot;the Stata is always going to look unfinished. It also looks as if it&#x27;s about to collapse. Columns tilt at scary angles. Walls teeter, swerve, and collide in random curves and angles. Materials change wherever you look: brick, mirror-surface steel, brushed aluminum, brightly colored paint, corrugated metal. Everything looks improvised, as if thrown up at the last moment. That&#x27;s the point. The Stata&#x27;s appearance is a metaphor for the freedom, daring, and creativity of the research that&#x27;s supposed to occur inside it.&quot; Campbell stated that the cost overruns and delays in completion of the Stata Center are of no more importance than similar problems associated with the building of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. The 2005 Kaplan/&quot;Newsweek&quot; guide &quot;How to Get into College&quot;, which lists twenty-five universities its editors consider notable in some respect, recognizes MIT as having the &quot;hottest architecture&quot;, placing most of its emphasis on the Stata Center.

Though there are many who praise this building, and in fact from the perspective of Gehry&#x27;s other work it is considered by some as one of his best, there are certainly many who are less enamored of the structure. Mathematician and architectural theorist Nikos Salingaros has harshly criticized the Stata Center:

Former Boston University president John Silber said the building &quot;really is a disaster&quot;. Architecture critic Robert Campbell praised Gehry for &quot;break[ing] up the monotony of a street of concrete buildings&quot; and being &quot;a building like no other building&quot;. The style of the building has been likened to German Expressionism of the 1920s. The building has also been described as &quot;reminiscent of a Dr. Seuss creation&quot;.

==Lawsuit==

On October 31, 2007, MIT sued architect Frank Gehry and the construction companies, Skanska USA Building Inc. and NER Construction Management, for &quot;providing deficient design services and drawings&quot; which caused leaks to spring, masonry to crack, mold to grow, drainage to back up, and falling ice and debris to block emergency exits. A Skanska spokesperson said that, prior to construction, Gehry ignored warnings from Skanska and a consulting company regarding flaws in his design of an outdoor amphitheater, and rejected a formal request from Skanska to modify the design.

In a 2007 interview, Gehry, whose firm had been paid $15 million for the project, said construction problems were inevitable in the design of complex buildings. &quot;These things are complicated&quot;, he said, &quot;and they involved a lot of people, and you never quite know where they went wrong. A building goes together with seven billion pieces of connective tissue. The chances of it getting done ever without something colliding or some misstep are small&quot;. &quot;I think the issues are fairly minor&quot;, he added. &quot;M.I.T. is after our insurance.&quot; Gehry said that value engineering, the process by which elements of a project are eliminated to cut costs, was largely responsible for the problems. &quot;There are things that were left out of the design&quot;, he said. &quot;The client chose not to put certain devices on the roofs, to save money.&quot;

The lawsuit was reportedly settled in 2010 with most of the issues having been resolved.

<text>The Manx cat (, in earlier times often spelled Manks) is a breed of domestic cat (&quot;Felis catus&quot;) originating on the Isle of Man, with a mutation that shortens the tail. Many Manx have a small stub of a tail, but Manx cats are best known as being entirely tailless; this is the most distinguishing characteristic of the breed, along with elongated hind legs and a rounded head. Manx cats come in all coat colours and patterns, though all-white specimens are rare, and the coat range of the original stock was more limited. Long-haired variants are sometimes considered a separate breed, the Cymric cat.

Manx are prized as skilled hunters, and thus have often been sought by farmers with rodent problems, and been a preferred ship&#x27;s cat breed. They are said to be social, tame and active. An old local term for the cats on their home island is stubbin or rumpy. Manx have been exhibited in cat shows since the 1800s, with the first known breed standard published in 1903.

==History==
===Origin and folklore===

Tailless cats, then called &quot;&quot; (apparently both singular and plural) in colloquial Manx language, were known by the early 19th century as cats from the Isle of Man, hence the name, where they remain a substantial but declining percentage of the local cat population. The taillessness arose as a natural mutation on the island, though folklore persists that tailless domestic cats were brought there by sea. They are descended from mainland stock of obscure origin. Like all house cats, including nearby British and Irish populations, they are ultimately descended from the African wildcat (&quot;Felis lybica&quot;) and not from native European wildcats (&quot;Felis silvestris&quot;), of which the island has long been devoid.

The dominant trait of taillessness arises from a spontaneous mutation, the Manx taillessness gene, that eventually became common on the island because of the limited genetic diversity of island biogeography (an example of the founder effect and, at , of the species-area curve).

In the Manx language, the modern name of the breed is &quot;,&quot; literally &#x27;cat of Mann&#x27; (plural &#x27; or &#x27;), or &#x27; lit. &#x27;bob-tailed cat&#x27;. &#x27;, used as both a masculine and feminine noun, is also encountered as &#x27;, and depending on the exact construction, it may be lenited as &#x27; or &#x27;. The diminutive word is &#x27; or &quot;&quot;, &#x27;kitten&#x27; (with various plurals). &quot;Manx&quot; itself was often spelled &quot;Manks&quot; in English well into the late 1800s.

There are numerous folktales about the Manx cat, all of them of &quot;relatively recent origin&quot;; they are focused entirely on the lack of a tail, and are devoid of religious, philosophical, or mythical aspects found in the traditional Irish–Norse folklore of the native Manx culture, and in legends about cats from other parts of the world.

The name of the promontory Spanish Head on the coast of the island is often thought to have arisen from the local tale of a ship of the Spanish Armada foundering in the area, though there is no evidence to suggest this actually occurred. Folklore has further claimed that a tailless cat swam ashore from said shipwreck, and thus brought the trait to the island. However, tailless cats are not commonly known in Spain, even if such a shipwreck were proven.

Regardless of the genetic and historical reality, there are various fanciful Lamarckian folktales that seek to explain why the Manx has a truncated tail. In one of them, the biblical Noah closed the door of the Ark when it began to rain, and accidentally cut off the tail of the Manx cat who had almost been left behind. Over the years a number of cartoons have appeared on postcards from the Isle of Man showing scenes in which a cat&#x27;s tail is being run over and severed by a variety of means including a motorcycle, a reference to motorcycle racing being popular on the island, and an update of the Noah story. Because the gene is so dominant and &quot;invades&quot; other breeds when crossed (often without owner knowledge) with the Manx, there was a folk belief that simply being in the proximity of a Manx cat could cause other breeds to somehow produce tailless kittens.

Another genetically impossible account claimed that the Manx was the hybrid offspring of a cat and a rabbit, purporting to explain why it has no or little tail, long hind legs and a sometimes hopping gait. The cat-rabbit halfbreed tale has been further reinforced by the more widespread &quot;cabbit&quot; folktale.

Populations of tailless cats also exist in a few other places in Europe, most notably Cornwall, only from the Isle of Man. A population on the small, isolated Danish peninsula (former island) of Reersø in the Great Belt may be due to the arrival on the island of cats of Manx origin, by ship. Similar cats are also found in Crimea, a near-island peninsula in the Black Sea, though whether they are genetically related to maritime Manx cats or are a coincidentally similar result of insular genetic diversity limitations, like the unrelated Kuril Islands Bobtail, Karelian Bobtail, Japanese Bobtail, and Indonesian Lombok cats, is unknown. The Manx gene may be related to the similarly dominant tail suppression gene of the recent American Bobtail breed, but Manx, Japanese Bobtails and other short-tailed cats are not used in its breeding program, and the mutation seems to have appeared in the breed spontaneously. Possible relation to the Pixie-bob breed, which also ranges from rumpy to fully tailed, is unknown.

===Recognition as a breed===
Manx cats have been exhibited in cat shows, as a named, distinct breed (and with the modern spelling &quot;Manx&quot;), since the late 1800s. In that era, few shows provided a Manx division, and exhibited specimens were usually entered under the &quot;Any Other Variety&quot; class, where they often could not compete well unless &quot;exceptionally good in size and markings&quot;. Early pet breeding and showing expert Charles Henry Lane, himself the owner of a prize-winning rare white rumpy Manx named Lord Luke, published the first known (albeit informal) breed standard for the Manx in his 1903 &quot;Rabbits, Cats and Cavies&quot;, but noted that already by the time of his writing &quot;if the judge understood the variety&quot; a Manx would be clearly distinguishable from some other tailless cat being exhibited, &quot;as the make of the animal, its movements and its general character are all distinctive.&quot; Not all cat experts of the day were favourable toward the breed; in &quot;The Cat: Its Points and Management in Health and Disease&quot;, Frank Townend Barton wrote in 1908: &quot;There is nothing to recommend the breed, the loss of the tail in no way enhances its beauty.&quot;

The Manx was one of the first breeds recognised by the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA) (the predominant United States–based pedigreed cat registry, founded in 1908), which has records on the breed in North America going back to the 1920s.

==Appearance==
===Tail (or lack thereof)===

Although tail suppression (or tail length variety) is not the sole characteristic feature of the breed, the chief defining one of the Manx cat is its absence of a tail to having a tail of long length, or tail of any length between the two extremes. This is a cat body-type mutation of the spine, caused by a dominant gene. As with the sometimes-tail-suppressed Schipperke dog and Old English Sheepdog, tail suppression does not &quot;breed true&quot; in Manx cats. Attempting to force the tailless trait to breed true by continually breeding tailless Manx cats to tailless Manx cats has led to increased negative, even fatal genetic disorders &quot;(see below)&quot;. Tail length is random throughout a litter of kittens. Manx to non-Manx breeding will usually produce some Manx-type tail varieties in kittens. Whether the shorter tailed kittens of these varieties are labeled Manx is up to the breed standard consulted. Manx cats&#x27; tails are classified according to proportional tail length as kittens (the proportion does not change after birth):
* Rumpy (rumpie) or dimple rumpy – having no tail at all, though often a small tuft of hair where the tail would have grown from the rump
* Riser or rumpy riser – having a bump of cartilage under the fur, most noticeable when the animal is happy and raising its tail end
* Stumpy (stumpie) – having a partial tail of vestigial, fused vertebrae, up to about long
* Stubby (stubbie), shorty, or short-tailed – having a short tail of non-fused bones, up to about half an average cat tail
* Longy (longie), tailed, or taily (tailie) – having a half- to normal-length tail.

Since the early days of breed recognition in the late 19th century, Manx show cats have been rumpy through stumpy specimens, with stubby and longy Manx not qualifying to be shown except in the &quot;Any Other Variety&quot; or household pet class. Kittens with complete tails may be born in a purebred Manx litter, having not inherited the taillessness appearance at all. Depending on the country and cat organization referenced, rumpy, rumpy risers and stumpies are the only Manx cat tail types that fit the breed standard for Manx cats. The longer cat tail lengths seen in some Manx cats are considered a breed fault, although they occur as naturally in the breed, but not as often, as the shorter tails. Although these longer tail types are of purebred Manx ancestry, they do not possess the dominant gene so cannot pass it on. However, since the Manx tail mutation gene is dominant, these longer-tailed purebred Manx cats may still be used in breeding programs and may even be considered in an effort to help avoid the fatal spinal deformities that sometimes result in tailless Manx cats.

The Manx breed is genetically distinct from the Japanese Bobtail breed, another naturally occurring insular breed. The Japanese Bobtail always has at least some tail, ranging from a small &quot;pom&quot; to a stubby but distinct tail, which is kinked or curled and usually has a slightly bulbous and fluffy appearance; by contrast, the Manx has a straight tail when one is present at all. The Japanese Bobtail has a markedly different appearance from the Manx, and is characterized by almond-shaped eyes, a triangular face, long ears, and lean body, like many other Asian breeds. The gene responsible for the bobbed or kinked tail in that breed is recessive and unrelated to the dominant Manx tail-suppression gene; the bobtail gene is not connected to any serious deformities, while the tail-suppression gene can, under certain conditions, give rise to a pattern of sometimes lethal health problems. The Pixie-bob breed also has a short tail, and may be genetically related to the Manx. More will be clear about tail genetics as more genetic studies are done on cat populations and as DNA testing improves; most domestic animal genetic work has been done with dogs and livestock breeds.

Manx (and other tail-suppressed breeds) do not exhibit problems with balance; balance is controlled primarily by the inner ear. In cats, dogs and other large-bodied mammals, balance involves but is not dependent upon the tail (contrast with rats, for whom the tail is a quite significant portion of their body mass).

Since Manx kittens are naturally born with any tail length, from none to long, it was formerly common to surgically dock the longer tails a few days after birth. Although illegal in many jurisdictions (including much of Europe), the practice was formerly recommended, although with the caveat that the commonness of the practice meant that many spurious Manx cats – i.e., random British cats – were altered to resemble the Manx, to defraud unwary buyers.

===Body and legs===
Manx are medium-sized cats, broad-chested with sloping shoulders and flat sides, and in show condition are firmly muscular and lean, neither bulky nor fatty. Lane reported the original, native breed as ranging typically from ten to twelve pounds for males and eight to ten pounds for females, with many smaller examples but only rare ones larger. The hind legs of Manx are notably longer than the fore legs, causing the rump to be higher than the shoulder and creating a continuous arch from shoulders to rump giving the cat an overall rounded or humped appearance, though the breed is comparatively long when stretched out. The fore legs are strong and straight. The shape is often described as rabbit-like.

===Head===
Manx cats&#x27; heads are rounded in shape, and medium in depth with a long neck. The upright, round-tipped and front-facing ears are largish. The eyes are large, rounded, and prominent, with their outer corners higher than the inner ones. Absent any bloodlines with a dominant alternative eye color (such as blue in Siamese or related ancestry), Manx often have some hue variant of gold eyes, and for show purposes follow the eye colour standards of the same coat colour/pattern in non-Manx short-hairs.

===Coat===
Manx cats exhibit two coat lengths. Short- or long-haired, all Manx have a thick, double-layered coat. The colour and pattern ranges exhibited should conform to the standards for that type of coat in non-Manx.

The more common short-haired Manx – the original breed – has a coat with a dense, soft, under layer and a longer, coarse outer layer with guard hairs. The overall appearance of the coat is fine, short and lying close to the skin, versus fluffy or voluminous.

The long-haired Manx, known to some cat registries as the Cymric, has a silky-textured double coat of medium length, with &quot;breeches&quot; (i.e. a distinct jump in fur length at the hocks giving the appearance of old-fashioned, baggy, knee-length pants ) belly ruff and neck ruff, tufts of fur between the toes and full &quot;ear furnishings&quot; (hairs in ears). The CFA considers the Cymric to be a variety of Manx and judges it in the short-hair division even though it is long-haired, while The International Cat Association (TICA) judges it in the long-hair division as a distinct Cymric breed. The long-haired variety is of comparatively recent development. Lane wrote in 1903 that the Manx &quot;to the best of my knowledge, information and belief, does not include any long-haired specimens&quot;, in his detailed chapter on the breed.

Regardless of coat length, the colours and coat patterns occurring in the breed today run the gamut of virtually all breeds due to extensive cross-breeding, though not all registries may accept all coats as qualifying for breeding or show. The most common coats are tabby, tortoiseshell, calico and solid colours. Widely divergent Manx specimens, including even a colour-point, blue-eyed, long-haired variant of evident Himalayan ancestry, have been celebrated on Isle of Man postage stamps since the 1980s, and recent publications often show marbled and spotted varieties. The original insular stock, however, were of less widespread variation. Lane, having &quot;seen a great many of them&quot; wrote of Manx cats that &quot;[i]t is curious that the colours in this variety seem somewhat limited&quot; and that the breed &quot;does not comprise all the colours usually associated with other short-haired varieties&quot;. He reported only very common orange, common orange and white, common cream tabby, uncommon tortoiseshell, and very rare all-white specimens in 1903. Calico and point-coloured are notably absent from this list, as are even today&#x27;s common colourful tabbies. However, writing in England only five years later, Barton suggested that &quot;the Manx may be of any colour, but probably orange is the most frequently met with.&quot;

Specific registries have particular, and differing, standards of points with regard to coloration and patterning. For example, the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) classifies the Manx as a variant of the British Shorthair (BSH), and thus requires that Manx cats to have one of the coat patterns that would be permissible in the BSH rather than any that is exclusive to a &quot;foreign&quot; type (e.g. point colouration). New Zealand Cat Fancy (NZCF) does likewise for colour and markings, but requires a double-coat and other Manx-specific features that GCCF does not. Some other registries are even more restrictive, while others are more liberal.

==Variants (sub-breeds)==
Four new, consistent varieties have been developed from the Manx (the original version of which is now sometimes consequently called the Shorthair Manx). These are the Cymric (Longhair Manx), the Isle of Man Shorthair and Isle of Man Longhair, and the Tasman Manx, though only the Cymric has garnered widespread acceptance in breed registries .

===Cymric (Manx Longhair)===

The Cymric or Manx Longhair is a tailless or partially tailed cat of Manx stock, with semi-long to long hair, e.g. as the result of cross-breeding with Himalayan, Persian and other longer-haired breeds early in its development. While its name refers to Wales (&quot;&quot;), the breed was actually developed in Canada, which has honoured the breed with a commemorative 50-cent coin in 1999.

Simply covering it in their Manx breed standards, the US-based Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA), the Co-ordinating Cat Council of Australia (CCCA), and the UK&#x27;s Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) recognise the variety as a longer-haired Manx rather than &quot;Cymric&quot; (the CFA and CCCA call it the Manx Longhair, while GCCF uses the term Semi-longhair Manx Variant). The majority of cat registries have explicit Cymric standards (published separately or along with Manx). Of the major registries, only the Feline Federation Europe (FFE) does not recognise the breed or sub-breed at all, under any name, (their Manx standard was last updated 17 May 2004).

=== Isle of Man Shorthair (tailed) ===
Resembling the British Shorthair, the Isle of Man Shorthair is essentially a fully tailed Manx cat. That is, it is a cat of Manx stock, with Manx features, but without any expression of the Manx taillessness gene. , it is only recognised by New Zealand Cat Fancy (NZCF) with its own breed standard. Any coat colour and pattern acceptable in the British Shorthair is permissible in the IoM Shorthair (the same restriction is applied to the Manx in the NZCF standard), and it requires the double coat of the Manx. In other international registries (e.g. GCCF, who also treat Manx as a British Shorthair variant), such cats are designated &quot;Tailed Manx&quot; and only recognised as Manx breeding stock (they are important as such, since breeding two tailless Manx together results in birth defects), and cannot be show cats.

=== Isle of Man Longhair (tailed) ===
Essentially a fully tailed Cymric cat, i.e., a cat of Cymric (and thus Manx) stock, the Isle of Man Longhair has Cymric features, but without expression of the Manx taillessness gene. , it is only recognised as a separate breed by NZCF with a breed standard. Coat colours are limited to those acceptable in the British Shorthair, and requires the double, thick, long coat of the Cymric.

=== Tasman Manx (curly-coated) ===
Named after Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand, the Tasman Manx is a tailless or partially tailed Manx cat with a curly-haired coat not unlike that of a Selkirk Rex, due a recessive mutation which arose in Manx litters in both Australia and New Zealand. , the breed is only recognised by the NZCF and the Catz Inc. registry (also of New Zealand) with breed standards. The coat may be short or semi-long.

The type arose possibly without existing rex mutation bloodlines (and none of the rex breeds are permitted as out-cross partners with Tasman Manx in Catz breeding guidelines). Depending on length of tail (if any) and coat, kittens may sometimes be termed &quot;Tasman Cymric&quot;, &quot;Tasman Isle of Man Shorthair&quot; or &quot;Tasman Isle of Man Longhair&quot;, but these are not considered separate breeds. The term &quot;Tasman Rex&quot; has been applied to cats with this gene that do not fall into one of the previously mentioned labels (lacking the Manx face and body shape to qualify), though relation if any to extant Rex mutation breeds is unclear. All of these additional terms beyond &quot;Tasman Manx&quot; appear to be &quot;recognised&quot;, even promulgated by NZCF but without breed standards, and even the permissive Catz registry does not include them .

==Health and genetics==

The Manx taillessness gene is dominant and highly penetrant; kittens from two Manx parents are generally born without any tail. Being homozygous for (having two copies of) the gene is usually lethal &quot;in utero&quot;, resulting in miscarriage. Thus, tailless cats can carry only one copy of the gene. Because of the danger of having two copies of the taillessness gene, breeders avoid breeding two entirely tailless Manx cats together. Because neither parent carries the tailless allele, a fully tailed Manx bred to another fully tailed Manx results in all fully tailed kittens.

Some partial tails are prone to a form of arthritis that causes the cat severe pain, and in rare cases Manx-bred kittens are born with kinked short tails because of incomplete growth of the tail during development. Stumpy to long tails are sometimes docked at birth as a preventative measure.

&quot;Manx syndrome&quot; or &quot;Manxness&quot; is a colloquial name given to the condition which results when the tailless gene shortens the spine too much. It can seriously damage the spinal cord and the nerves, causing a form of spina bifida, as well as problems with the bowels, bladder, and digestion. Very small bladders are indicative of the disease, and it is often difficult to diagnose. Death can occur quite suddenly, and some live for only 3–4 years; the oldest recorded was a female cat named Pharrah at 7 years when affected with the disease. In one report, it was shown to affect about 30% of Manx cats studied, but nearly all of those cases were rumpies, which exhibit the most extreme phenotype. Feline expert Roger Tabor has stated: &quot;Only the fact that the Manx is a historic breed stops us being as critical of this dangerous gene as of other more recent selected abnormalities.&quot;

The breed is also predisposed to rump fold intertrigo, and to corneal dystrophy. In a review of over 5,000 cases of urate urolithiasis the Manx was noticeably under-represented, with an odds ratio of 0.35.
Some tailless cats such as the Manx cats may develop megacolon, which is a recurring condition causing constipation that can be life-threatening to the cat if not properly monitored. It is a condition in which, due to absence of a tail, the smooth muscle that normally contracts to push stools toward the rectum loses its ability to do so.

Following on updated genetic research, both the Australian Cat Federation and (less stringently) the GCCF impose special breeding restrictions on Manx cats (and derived stock like the Cymric), for animal welfare reasons.

=== Identification of the Manx Cat tailless gene ===

In 2013, prior to initiation of the Manx Cat Genome Project (below), genetic mutations in the brachyury gene were shown to be responsible for failure of tail development in the Manx cat, as well as four other tailless breeds of cat. Mutations in orthologs of this gene have been shown to cause tail-loss defects in a number of other species, notably the mouse. Mutations in the human version of the brachyury gene are associated with a range of neural tube defects.

=== Manx Cat Genome Project ===
To better understand the genetics of the breed, the Manx Cat Genome Project (MCGP) was launched in August 2015, as a crowdfunded volunteer project by computational biologist Rachel Glover of Douglas, Isle of Man, to perform the first whole genome sequencing of the Manx cat, uncovering the genetic mutations that make the Manx distinct from other cat populations, and to contribute data to the genome databases at the 99 Lives Cat Genome Sequencing Project of the University of Missouri, and the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). It is the Isle of Man&#x27;s first gene sequencing programme, with samples collected and data analysed by MCGP in the Isle of Man, with the input of scientists around the world, initial sequencing work being performed by the firm Edinburgh Genomics and the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and by 99 Lives, and server resources donated by Isle of Man biomedical information technology company ServiceTech.

The project aims to answer four questions:
# Which mutations are unique to the breed, aside from the obvious suppressed tail?
# What genes are involved in Manx syndrome?
# What genes control tail length? (The Manx taillessness gene only determines whether the tail will be suppressed, not the extent of suppression.)
# Is there a genetic basis for any health problems associated with the breed other than Manx syndrome?
One desired result of this research is the development of tests that can be used to keep the breed healthy by identifying cats which should not be bred. A minimum of three cats&#x27; genes will have to be sequenced to obtain the required genetic data.

After the initial fundraising goal was reached in December 2015, the first cat sequenced was a purebred Manx calico rumpy named Bonnag, selected because the registry of this dam (breeding female) and her kittens in the British Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) aids controlled study of a specific bloodline. Bonnag&#x27;s samples were sent for sequencing in April 2016, with raw gene sequence results received by MCGP in August 2016; the laborious process of genome assembly has begun, to be followed by comparison with previously collected cat genomic data from 99 Lives, and eventual peer-reviewed publication of the results in a scientific journal. Fundraising for the second genome to be sequenced by the project began September 2016; costs dropped to UK£1,400 per cat in November 2015, and as of April 2016 dropped to about £1,200, using the Illumina HiSeq X Ten sequencer, down from original projections of £10,000 before the X Ten was available for non-human sequencing. The dramatic drop in costs allowed the first cat&#x27;s sequencing to be done well ahead of the original schedule. MCGP has already identified the location of the mutation responsible for suppression of Bonnag&#x27;s tail, the deletion of a single bit of genetic data among 2.8 billion making up the genome.

The selected second sample is from a kitten that had to be euthanised for Manx syndrome, and it is hoped that this new sequence can identify the genetic specifics of the condition and why it only affects some offspring.

==Behaviour==
Fancier&#x27;s often describe the Manx as being doglike in behaviour.

These beliefs about the Manx&#x27;s behaviour were not described in the past.
Lane&#x27;s early and experienced account of the temperament of this &quot;variety, which is quaint and interesting&quot; is simply that they were &quot;docile, good-tempered and sociable&quot;, and that a prize specimen should be &quot;an alert, active animal of much power and energetic character.&quot;

Manx are prized as hunters, known to take down larger prey (e.g. adult rats) even when they are young, and were thus long in demand for working roles like farm cat (Manx: &#x27; or &#x27; &#x27;mouser&#x27;, from &#x27; &#x27;mouse&#x27;) and ship&#x27;s cat (&#x27; or &#x27; loosely &#x27;scratcher, scratchy-one&#x27;, from &#x27; or &quot;&quot; &#x27;scratching, scratchy, scraping&#x27;).

==In popular culture==
===Isle of Man national symbol===

The Isle of Man uses the Manx cat as one of the symbols of the island nation and its unique culture. On Isle of Man currency, Manx cats are the subject of the reverse of four special commemorative crown coins. The first two, issued in 1970 and 1975, are stand-alone releases in both copper-nickel and silver proofs, while the third, in 1988, inaugurated an ongoing series of annual cat coin issues that have also been produced in gold in various sizes; an almost-hidden Manx cat appears in the background on each of the 1989-onward releases featuring other breeds. A Manx, with a kitten, was the featured cat again in 2012.

A Manx cat, in stylized Celtic knotwork art, also appears on the island&#x27;s 1980–83 penny. The breed figures on numerous Isle of Man postage stamps, including a 2011 series of six that reproduce the art from Victorian era Manx cat postcards, a 1996 one-stamp decorative sheetlet, one stamp in a 1994 tourism 10-stamp booklet, a 1996 five-stamp series of Manx cats around the world, and a 1989 set of the breed in various coat patterns, plus two high-value definitives of 1983 and 1989. The cat appears prominently as the subject of a large number of tourist goods and Manx pride items available on the island and over the Internet, serving (along with the triskelion and the four-horned Manx Loaghtan sheep) as an emblem of the Isle of Man.

===Famous real-world Manx cats===
* All Ball, Lipstick, and Smokey, three Manx cats that were companion animals to Koko, a captive gorilla renowned for communicating in rudimentary American Sign Language

* Bonnag, a female Manx, the first of her breed to have her whole genome sequenced (in 2016, by the Manx Cat Genome Project, ), and only the second cat of any breed to receive this level of study (the first was an Abyssinian sequenced by the 99 Lives project in 2014). Bonnag was bred by Zoe Grundey at the Triskele Manx Cats cattery in Douglas, Isle of Man. 
* Peta, Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office of the United Kingdom government between 1964 and sometime between 1969 and 1976.

===Other===
The Norton Manx motorcycle line (1947–1962, Norton Motors Ltd.), though ostensibly named after the Isle of Man TT road race (which the brand dominated for decades, until the 1970s), was long promoted with Manx cat badges, in the forms of both enameled metal pins and sew-on patches. The Manx Norton has experienced a major revival among modern enthusiasts of classic motorcycle racing.

The Meyers Manx (1964–1971, B. F. Meyers &amp; Co.) is the original, much-copied Volkswagen Beetle–based dune buggy, and broke desert racing records shortly after its introduction. It was named after the cat, due to its design – short-bodied, tall-wheeled, and manoeuvrable. The original designer has revived and updated it as the &quot;Manxter&quot; (2000–present, Meyers Manx, Inc.).

A popular flying model aircraft of the late 1950s was the Manx Cat, sold in kit form as the Manx Cat V, and in printed plan form as the Manx Cat I through IV, with progressively larger wings. Designed by Bob Buragas, the hand-launched biplane model is constructed of balsa wood, features a very short tail (thus the name), has a 32.5 inch wingspan (in versions IV and V), can accommodate .19 to .35 engine sizes, and can be modified with a Dumas Spectrum &quot;combat&quot; wing. It was profiled in hobbyist magazines, like the February 1957 &quot;Flying Models&quot; (which details the history of the different models, including a miniature Manx Kitten version), and the October 1958 &quot;American Modeler&quot;.

A Grimjack comic book story, &quot;The Manx Cat&quot;, was serialised as a Comicmix.com webcomic in January 2011, and has since seen print as a six-issue miniseries by IDW Comics. The story involves &quot;The Manx Cat&quot;, a statuette of such a cat that at first seems to be a simple MacGuffin like the classic &quot;Maltese Falcon&quot; of the novel and films of that name, but which begins showing malevolent powers. The plot thickens with time travel, reincarnation, and Cthulhu Mythos-style &quot;elder gods&quot;. Like most modern comics, it features digitally-colored art, over hand-drawn pencil work.

In popular music, Florrie Forde released a 1930 recording of a Dan Leno Jr comedic music hall song, &quot;What Happened to the Manx Cat&#x27;s Tail?&quot;, as the B-side of &quot;Stein! Stein! Ev&#x27;rywhere We Go&quot;, on an 8-inch, 78 RPM gramophone record (serial number 1430 on the Edison Bell Radio label).

<doc id="145675" wikidata="Q42578" url="?curid=145675" title="Cymric cat">
<text>The Cymric ( , ) is a Canadian cat breed. Some cat registries consider the Cymric a semi-long-haired variety of the Manx breed, rather than a separate breed. Except for the length of fur, in all other respects, the two varieties are the same, and kittens of either sort may appear in the same litter. The name comes from &quot;Cymru&quot; (), the indigenous Welsh name of Wales, even though the breed is not associated with Wales. The name may have been chosen to provide a &quot;Celtic&quot; sounding moniker for the breed. While the breed&#x27;s Manx bloodline originated from the Isle of Man, the long-haired variant is claimed to have been developed by Canada. The breed is called the Longhair Manx or a similar name by some registries.

==History==
According to the Isle of Man records, the taillessness trait of the Manx (and ultimately the Cymric) began as a mutation among the island&#x27;s domestic cat population. Given the island&#x27;s closed environment and small gene pool, the dominant gene that decided the cats&#x27; taillessness was easily passed from one generation to the next, along with the gene for long hair. Long-haired kittens had been born to Manx cats on the Isle of Man, but had always been discarded by breeders as &quot;mutants&quot;. Then, in the 1960s, similar kittens were born in Canada and were intentionally bred. This was the start of the increase in Cymric popularity. It took many years for cat associations to recognize the Cymric as a breed of its own. While the Manx was recognized in the 1920s, the Cymric was not shown until the 1960s and did not gain popularity until the mid-1970s.

The Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe, since 2006), World Cat Federation (WCF), Canadian Cat Association (CCA-AFC), Australian Cat Federation (ACF), New Zealand Cat Fancy (NZCF), Southern Africa Cat Council (SACC), American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA, of the US East Coast), and Cat Fanciers&#x27; Federation (CFF, in the US Northeast) consider the Cymric a separate breed. The Cat Aficionado Association (CAA) of China does also, by virtue of the CAA having adopted all the breed standards of its Western partner, ACFA; it is unknown if any Cymric breeders are actually in China.

The International Cat Association (TICA) recognizes the Cymric as a variety of Manx, not a separate breed with its own standards. Also, simply covering it in their Manx breed standards, the US-based Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA), the Co-ordinating Cat Council of Australia (CCCA), and the UK&#x27;s Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) recognize the variety as the long-haired Manx rather than a Cymric (the CFA and CCCA call it the Manx Longhair, while GCCF uses the term Semi-longhair Manx Variant). The ACF formerly took this route, calling it the Longhaired Manx, but recognized it as a separate breed (Cymric) at the beginning of 2015, using the GCCF Manx standard (aside from coat length).

== Appearance ==

=== Body ===
The Cymric is a muscular, compact, medium to large cat with a sturdy bone structure, but the lack of a tail can make them appear small. Males of this Canadian cat breed can weigh up to 12 pounds, while, female usually weigh between 8 and 12 pounds. They have a rounded appearance and their front legs are shorter than their hind legs. Their eyes come in various shades such as amber, green, hazel, copper, gold, yellow, and orange. Cymrics also exhibit tall ears that are angled slightly outwards and are adorned with moderate ear tufts.

=== Coat ===
Their semi-long, dense, and resilient double coat consists of a shorter, soft undercoat (known as an awn). The Cymric cat&#x27;s coat is notably long and voluminous around the ruff, extending downward to create a shirtfront. Additionally, the coat extends onto the upper portion of the hindquarters above the hock, creating breeches, a term derived from the visual effect of a cat&#x27;s fur replicating traditional, baggy knee-length pants. In the show ring, the quality of a cat&#x27;s coat has greater significance than its color or markings, even though Cymric can display a wide array of colors and patterns.

=== Tail ===

Similar to their parent breed, kittens in a Cymric litter can have various tail lengths and are classified by the proportion:

* Rumpy - Completely lacks a tail with no extension of the tailbone

* Rumpy Riser - Up to three vertebrae at the end of the spine that will rise when pet
* Stumpy - Up to five vertebrae at the end of the spine, resulting in a small stump
* Longies - A tail longer than five vertebrae but is shorter than a full length tail

Rumpies are the most valued for cat show purposes and is the only show cat type in some organizations.

=== Isle of Man Longhair (tailed variant) ===
The Isle of Man Longhair is a fully tailed Cymric cat, i.e. a cat of Cymric (and thus Manx) stock, with Cymric features, but without expression of the Manx taillessness gene. It is presently only recognized as a separate breed by the New Zealand Cat Fancy (NZCF) with a breed standard. Coat colours are limited to those acceptable in the British Shorthair, and require the doubled and thick, long coat of the Cymric. In other international registries, such cats are designated &quot;Tailed Cymric&quot; or &quot;Tailed Manx Longhair&quot;, only recognized as breeding stock (they are important as such, since breeding two tailless Manx or Cymrics together results in birth defects), and cannot be show cats.

==Health==
The genetic mutation that gives both the Cymric and Manx their unusual tails is also responsible for other health complications like spina bifida, a spinal defect that can result in neurological issues whether that is difficult with movement or waste elimination. A rabbit-like hop can sometimes be seen in Cymric cats due to the spinal deformity. Most of the time, these problems are identified before six months of age.

The gene that gives the Cymric and Manx their unusual tails can also be lethal. Kittens who inherit two copies of the tailless gene die before birth and are reabsorbed in the womb. Since these kittens make up about 25 percent of all kittens, litters are usually small. Even cats who inherit only one copy of the gene can have what is called &quot;Manx syndrome&quot;. Not every Cymric with a short spine has problems or Manx syndrome. It is simply an attribute of the Manx gene, and its expression cannot be entirely prevented.

Following updated genetic research, both the ACF and (less stringently) the GCCF impose special breeding restrictions on Manx cats (including the Cymric, however named and classified), for animal welfare reasons.

<text>An autobiographical novel, also known as a autobiographical fiction, fictional autobiography, or autobiographical fiction novel, is a type of novel which uses autofiction techniques, or the merging of autobiographical and fictive elements. The literary technique is distinguished from a typical autobiography or memoir by being a work of &quot;fiction&quot; presented in the same fashion as a typical non-fiction autobiography by &quot;imitating the conventions of an autobiography.&quot;

Because an autobiographical novel is partially fiction, the author does not ask the reader to expect the text to fulfill the &quot;autobiographical pact&quot;. Names and locations are often changed and events are recreated to make them more dramatic but the story still bears a close resemblance to that of the author&#x27;s life. While the events of the author&#x27;s life are recounted, there is no pretense of exact truth. Events may be exaggerated or altered for artistic or thematic purposes.

A distinguish between fully autobiographical novels explained above, and semi-autobiographical novels can be made. The latter, also known as a roman à clef, are fictional works based on the author&#x27;s own life. Sylvia Plath&#x27;s &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is often considered to be an example of a semi-autobiographical novel.

<doc id="145684" wikidata="Q42636" url="?curid=145684" title="Scottish Fold">
<text>The Scottish Fold is a distinctive breed of domestic cat characterised by a natural dominant gene mutation associated with osteochondrodysplasia. This genetic anomaly affects cartilage throughout the body, causing the ears to &quot;fold&quot;, bending forward and down towards the front of the head. While this trait contributes to the breed&#x27;s unique appearance, often described as &quot;owl-like&quot;, it also causes health problems.

The breed&#x27;s name, originally lop-ears or lops after the lop-eared rabbit, became &quot;Scottish Fold&quot; in 1966. Depending on registries, longhaired Scottish Folds are varyingly known as Highland Fold, Scottish Fold Longhair, Longhair Fold and Coupari.

Research has revealed that all Scottish Fold cats are affected by osteochondrodysplasia, a developmental abnormality that affects cartilage and bone development throughout the body. This condition causes the ear fold as well as malformed bone structures, and the breed can develop severe painful degenerative joint diseases at an early age. Because of these health conditions, breeding Fold cats is prohibited in several countries, and some major cat registries do not recognise the breed.

==History==
===Origin===
The original Scottish Fold was a white barn cat named Susie, who was found at a farm near Coupar Angus in Tayside, Scotland, in 1961. Susie&#x27;s ears had an unusual fold in their middle, making her resemble an owl. When Susie had kittens, two of them were born with folded ears, and one was acquired by William Ross and his wife, Molly, neighbouring farmers who were cat fanciers. The breeding programme produced 76 kittens in the first three years – 42 with folded ears and 34 with straight ears. The conclusion from this was that the ear mutation is due to a simple dominant gene. Ross registered the breed with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) in the United Kingdom in 1966 and started to breed Scottish Fold kittens with the help of geneticist Pat Turner. However by the early 1970s the GCCF stopped registering the cat due to concerns about potential health issues such as ear infections and deafness.
In 1970 the first Scottish Fold kittens were introduced to America via a Dr. Neil Todd of Massachusetts who was researching the mutation. Further cats were brought over and the Scottish Fold breeding program continued with American Shorthairs and British Shorthairs being introduced.

=== Breed recognition ===
In 1978 the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA) granted the breed championship status.
In the mid 1980s the long-haired version started to gain recognition.
The International Cat Association (TICA) was the first registry to recognized the longhairs for championship competition in the 1987-88 show season and CFA followed in 1993-94.

==Characteristics==
===Ears===
Scottish Fold kittens that do not develop folded ears are known as Scottish Straights.

===Body===
The Scottish Fold is a medium to large sized cat, which can come in any colour, even calico. Males typically weigh , and females weigh . The Fold&#x27;s entire body structure, especially the head and face, is generally rounded, and the eyes large and round. The nose is short with a gentle curve, and the cat&#x27;s body is well-rounded with a padded look and medium-to-short legs. The head is domed at the top, and the neck very short. The broadly-spaced eyes give the Scottish Fold a &quot;sweet expression&quot;.

===Coat===

Scottish Folds can be either long- or short-haired, and they may have nearly any coat colour or combination of colours (including white). Shorthair Scottish Folds have thick and soft fur, with longhair Folds having longer fur and tufts located around the extremities.

==Genetics==
An early study suggested that the fold is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. A later study suggested an incomplete dominance. A cat with folded ears may have either one (heterozygous) or two copies (homozygous) of the dominant fold gene (Fd). A cat with normal ears should have two copies of the normal gene (fd).



Mating a homozygous fold with any cat will produce all folds, but because homozygous folds are prone to severe health issues, breeding for them is generally considered unethical. A homozygous to normal mating will produce only heterozygous folds but presumably in ethical breeding programs, there will be no homozygous cats available to breed from.
The only generally accepted breeding gives a 50% chance of producing heterozygous folds and 50% chance of producing progeny with normal genes.

There is suspicion that some non-fold litters are genetically heterozygous folds but because of very low expression of the gene, appear to be straight-eared. Such kittens may develop folded ears initially which then straighten back out. Because of this there are suggestions by some breeders to avoid mating Folds with straight-eared Scottish Folds but only use British Shorthairs (BSH) as outcross. If Scottish Shorthairs are to be used, they should be test mated to a BSH to make sure that they are not genetically folds. If such apparent straight-eared cats are mated with a fold, there is a 75% chance of folds (25% homozygous folds, 50% heterozygous folds) and 25% chance of straight ears.

In 2016, the genetic mutation responsible for the folded ears and the osteochondrodysplasia was identified. It was found in a gene encoding a calcium permeable ion channel, transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 4 (TRPV4). The mutation is a V342F substitution (c.1024G&gt;T) in the fifth ankyrin repeat within the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain. It was also found in a human patient with metatropic dysplasia.

==Acceptance==
Legal bans on the breeding and sometimes sale of Folds have been enacted in several countries, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Netherlands, Norway, and Scotland, due to the breed&#x27;s health issues, especially deformities and pain caused by osteochondrodysplasia, which results in abnormalities in bone and cartilage throughout the body. Some of the major cat registries, such as the GCCF and FIFe, do not recognise, nor allow for the registry and competition showing of, Scottish folds.

=== Legal bans ===
Due to the prevalence of osteochondrodysplasia in the breed , several countries and states have prohibited breeding with Scottish folds, in order to protect animal welfare. Banning countries include the Netherlands in 2014, Austria in 2020, Flanders (Belgium) in 2021, Victoria (Australia). The breed is also indirectly banned by Norwegian and Swedish legislation prohibiting the breeding of animals with genetic make up that makes it likely to produce unhealthy offspring. Some countries have also banned selling of Scottish fold cats, or the breeding with any cat that bears the gene mutation resulting in osteochondrodysplasia, so even breeding with some of the Scottish straights may be legally restricted. Potential parent cats can be tested for this mutation before breeding.

=== Registry bans ===
Because of its health problems, the breed is not accepted by either the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy or the Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe). GCCF withdrew registrations in 1971 due to crippling deformity of the limbs and tail in some cats and concerns about genetic difficulties and ear problems such as infection, mites, and deafness, but the Folds were exported to the Americas and the breed continued to be established, using outcrossing with British Shorthairs and American Shorthairs. Since the initial concerns were brought, the Fold breed has not had the mite and infection problems.

Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association breeders have stated that using only fold to non-fold breeding has eliminated problems with stiff tails, shortened tails, and bone lesions. In the FIFe discussion, the representative for British breeders claimed that they were not seeing the problem in their cats, and that the study which showed that all heterozygous also have the condition had a small sample size. An offer of free X-ray radiography was presented to 300 breeders to find a Fold cat with healthy hind legs, but it was never taken up. A similar offer was set up by the World Cat Federation together with researcher Leslie Lyons but there was also no response. FIFe stated that they will not consider recognizing Scottish Folds if breeders will not allow their breed to be scrutinized.

In a report on Scottish Folds, the Breed Standards Advisory Council for New Zealand Cat Fancy (NZCF) states that &quot;Breeders may not have appreciated the strength of the evidence that heterozygous cats can and do develop [feline] OCD.&quot; While research shows that all heterozygous Folds develop OCD, and anecdotal evidence shows that heterozygous Folds can and do develop OCD, they do not show whether mildly affected parents are more likely to have mildly affected offspring. They also do not show what percentage of Folds are severely affected. The report states that there is not enough information to justify banning Scottish Fold matings, but enough to justify a level of concern. Recommended guidelines include:

* A requirement for periodic vet examination of breeding cats for any evidence of lameness, stiffness, or pain—breeding cats with signs to be desexed. 
* A requirement for periodic X-rays of breeding cats and comparison of X-ray evidence with clinical symptoms, possibly leading to a requirement that cats with a specified degree of skeletal change to be desexed.
* Requesting the agreement of pet owners to be periodically contacted by the NZCF or by a researcher, to provide reports about the health of their cat. 
* All information to be reported/submitted to the BSAC to allow information to be collated to give an overall picture of FOCD in Scottish Folds in NZ.
* Requirements to be in place for a minimum of 5 years to enable tracking of the health of Folds over time.

===Popularity===
Despite warnings from organisation such as GCCF (&quot;we strongly advise members of the public not to try to acquire cats of this breed&quot;), the distinctive physical traits of the Scottish Fold, combined with their reputation as unusually loving companions, make Folds highly sought-after pets, with Fold kittens typically costing considerably more than kittens of more common breeds. Scottish folds are also popular among celebrities, one of them being American singer Taylor Swift, who owns two Scottish fold cats named Meredith Grey (after the titular character of the medical drama series &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;), and Olivia Benson (after the protagonist of the police drama series &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;).

==Health==
Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is prevalent in the Scottish Fold. A study in Japan of cats suspected to have kidney problems found that 54% of tested Scottish Fold cats had the PKD1 mutation, which is responsible for PKD.

A study in Japan found two genes linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the Scottish Fold population.

===Osteochondrodysplasia===
A defect of aural cartilage gives the Scottish Fold the characteristic appearance. This cartilage defect is caused by an autosomal dominant gene. This mutation also causes a shortened and stiff tail that lacks rigidity. It also causes a skeletal dysplasia known as osteochondrodysplasia. All Scottish Fold cats develop arthritis: heterozygous cats develop a progressive form of arthritis and homozygous cats develop a severe arthritis much quicker than heterozygous cats. Near the tarsal and metatarsal joints exostosis forms in kittens with the condition. Endochondral ossification is retarded and metatarsal and metacarpal bones fail to reach full length and develop abnormally result in improper shapes for the bones. Treatment is possible with either palliative radiation and surgery, which can be either excising the exostoses or a bilateral pantarsal arthrodesis can alleviate lameness; however, given all fold cats will become affected the only solution is the cessation of breeding of affected cats.

In a 2021 study, four radiologists, blinded to the ear phenotype, assessed radiographs of 22 Scottish Fold/Straight cats. All cats were genotyped showing the heterozygous mutation in all folded ear cats but not in straight cats. Each reviewer gave on average the folded ear cats a worse &quot;severity score&quot;, however the images showed much milder signs than previously published. The authors state that the severity of OCD in heterozygous cats is very variable and subtle. This could be due to other modifier genes or nurture (climate, diet, exercise). So it was shown that the least affected folded ear cat was given identical or less score than the highest rated straight ear cat.

In a 2020 case study, two Scottish Fold mixed cats with severe exostosis in the hind leg are described. Both cats were homozygous for the TrpV4 mutation, assuming the parental cats had both the c.1024G&gt;T mutation in the TrpV4 gene. This reinforces the hypothesis that mostly homozygous Scottish Folds are severely affected. On the other hand it is concerning that still Scottish Fold cats are bred with each other, also breeding with other cat strains with skeletal abnormalities (Munchkin, American Curl) should be avoided.

In a large retrospective Australian study over 30,000 patient records from veterinary clinics were searched for specific keywords to look for the occurrence of OCD in Scottish Fold cats. Of 1131 Scottish Folds, 12 were detected with OCD (1.1%) and 5.7% were suspected of OCD. 

In a study by Sartore et al., in which folded-eared cats were genetically analyzed and only one specific gene variant (c.1024G&gt;T) was examined, it was found that 1 out of 12 cats showed signs of OCD. The authors speculate that it is not just this mutation in the TRPV4 gene that is responsible for the development of OCD.

Because heterozygous Scottish Folds also develop progressive arthritis of varying severity, some researchers recommend abandoning the breeding of Fold cats entirely.

== In popular culture ==

=== &quot;The Cat Who Went to Paris&quot; ===
The short novel &quot;The Cat Who Went to Paris&quot; by Peter Gethers features &quot;the most famous Scottish Fold&quot; according to Grace Sutton of The Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association. The book - and the two that followed - document the life of Gethers and his Fold, Norton, from their first meeting to Norton&#x27;s eventual death and Gethers&#x27; experiences after the loss.

<text>The Ring En Español is a Spanish version of boxing publication &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine. &quot;Ring En Español&quot; was originally published from 1977 to 1985. Originally published from Caracas and later from Panama, it moved in 1981 to Miami, to Editorial America (currently owned by Televisa), the same editorial house that oversaw the production of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;s Spanish version.

Although &quot;Ring En Español&quot; covered every boxing event worldwide, it concentrated more than anything else on Hispanic boxers, helping boxers like Wilfred Benítez, Wilfredo Gómez, Julio César Chávez, Eusebio Pedroza, Roberto Durán, Santos Laciar, Antonio Cervantes, Pipino Cuevas, Ossie Ocasio, Lupe Pintor, Rafael &quot;Bazooka&quot; Limón, Edwin Rosario, Héctor Camacho, Salvador Sanchez, Hilario Zapata and many others become international household names.

The unstable Latin American economy combined with rising magazine production costs and other factors caused &quot;The Ring En Español&quot; to come off the newsstands after the October 1985 edition. Lupe Pintor was featured on the magazine&#x27;s last cover, having won the WBC Super Bantamweight championship of the world by defeating Juan Meza the previous August in Mexico City, Mexico.

The &quot;Ring en Español&quot;&#x27;s top competitor was &quot;Guantes&quot;.

Starting in June 2019, The Ring magazine started publishing a Spanish version of the magazine, only in digital format.

<doc id="145694" wikidata="Q119253" url="?curid=145694" title="Oceanic trench">
<text>Oceanic trenches are prominent, long, narrow topographic depressions of the ocean floor. They are typically wide and below the level of the surrounding oceanic floor, but can be thousands of kilometers in length. There are about of oceanic trenches worldwide, mostly around the Pacific Ocean, but also in the eastern Indian Ocean and a few other locations. The greatest ocean depth measured is in the Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench, at a depth of below sea level.

Oceanic trenches are a feature of the Earth&#x27;s distinctive plate tectonics. They mark the locations of convergent plate boundaries, along which lithospheric plates move towards each other at rates that vary from a few millimeters to over ten centimeters per year. Oceanic lithosphere moves into trenches at a global rate of about per year. A trench marks the position at which the flexed, subducting slab begins to descend beneath another lithospheric slab. Trenches are generally parallel to and about from a volcanic arc.

Much of the fluid trapped in sediments of the subducting slab returns to the surface at the oceanic trench, producing mud volcanoes and cold seeps. These support unique biomes based on chemotrophic microorganisms. There is concern that plastic debris is accumulating in trenches and threatening these communities.

== Geographic distribution ==
There are approximately of convergent plate margins worldwide. These are mostly located around the Pacific Ocean, but are also found in the eastern Indian Ocean, with a few shorter convergent margin segments in other parts of the Indian Ocean, in the Atlantic Ocean, and in the Mediterranean. They are found on the oceanward side of island arcs and Andean-type orogens. Globally, there are over 50 major ocean trenches covering an area of 1.9 million km2 or about 0.5% of the oceans.

Trenches are geomorphologically distinct from troughs. Troughs are elongated depressions of the sea floor with steep sides and flat bottoms, while trenches are characterized by a V-shaped profile. Trenches that are partially infilled are sometimes described as troughs, for example the Makran Trough. Some trenches are completely buried and lack bathymetric expression as in the Cascadia subduction zone, which is completely filled with sediments. Despite their appearance, in these instances the fundamental plate-tectonic structure is still an oceanic trench. Some troughs look similar to oceanic trenches but possess other tectonic structures. One example is the Lesser Antilles Trough, which is the forearc basin of the Lesser Antilles subduction zone. Also not a trench is the New Caledonia trough, which is an extensional sedimentary basin related to the Tonga-Kermadec subduction zone. Additionally, the Cayman Trough, which is a pull-apart basin within a transform fault zone, is not an oceanic trench.

Trenches, along with volcanic arcs and Wadati–Benioff zones (zones of earthquakes under a volcanic arc) are diagnostic of convergent plate boundaries and their deeper manifestations, subduction zones. Here, two tectonic plates are drifting into each other at a rate of a few millimeters to over per year. At least one of the plates is oceanic lithosphere, which plunges under the other plate to be recycled in the Earth&#x27;s mantle.

Trenches are related to, but distinct from, continental collision zones, such as the Himalayas. Unlike in trenches, in continental collision zones continental crust enters a subduction zone. When buoyant continental crust enters a trench, subduction comes to a halt and the area becomes a zone of continental collision. Features analogous to trenches are associated with collision zones. One such feature is the &quot;peripheral foreland basin&quot;, a sediment-filled foredeep. Examples of peripheral foreland basins include the floodplains of the Ganges River and the Tigris-Euphrates river system.

== History of the term &quot;trench&quot; ==
Trenches were not clearly defined until the late 1940s and 1950s. The bathymetry of the ocean was poorly known prior to the Challenger expedition of 1872–1876, which took 492 soundings of the deep ocean. At station #225, the expedition discovered Challenger Deep, now known to be the southern end of the Mariana Trench. The laying of transatlantic telegraph cables on the seafloor between the continents during the late 19th and early 20th centuries provided further motivation for improved bathymetry. The term &quot;trench&quot;, in its modern sense of a prominent elongated depression of the sea bottom, was first used by Johnstone in his 1923 textbook &quot;An Introduction to Oceanography&quot;.

During the 1920s and 1930s, Felix Andries Vening Meinesz measured gravity over trenches using a newly developed gravimeter that could measure gravity from aboard a submarine. He proposed the &quot;tectogene hypothesis&quot; to explain the belts of negative gravity anomalies that were found near island arcs. According to this hypothesis, the belts were zones of downwelling of light crustal rock arising from subcrustal convection currents. The tectogene hypothesis was further developed by Griggs in 1939, using an analogue model based on a pair of rotating drums. Harry Hammond Hess substantially revised the theory based on his geological analysis.

World War II in the Pacific led to great improvements of bathymetry, particularly in the western Pacific. In light of these new measurements, the linear nature of the deeps became clear. There was a rapid growth of deep sea research efforts, especially the widespread use of echosounders in the 1950s and 1960s. These efforts confirmed the morphological utility of the term &quot;trench.&quot; Important trenches were identified, sampled, and mapped via sonar.

The early phase of trench exploration reached its peak with the 1960 descent of the Bathyscaphe &quot;Trieste&quot; to the bottom of the Challenger Deep. Following Robert S. Dietz&#x27; and Harry Hess&#x27; promulgation of the seafloor spreading hypothesis in the early 1960s and the plate tectonic revolution in the late 1960s, the oceanic trench became an important concept in plate tectonic theory.

== Morphology ==

Oceanic trenches are wide and have an asymmetric V-shape, with the steeper slope (8 to 20 degrees) on the inner (overriding) side of the trench and the gentler slope (around 5 degrees) on the outer (subducting) side of the trench. The bottom of the trench marks the boundary between the subducting and overriding plates, known as the basal plate boundary shear or the subduction décollement. The depth of the trench depends on the starting depth of the oceanic lithosphere as it begins its plunge into the trench, the angle at which the slab plunges, and the amount of sedimentation in the trench. Both starting depth and subduction angle are greater for older oceanic lithosphere, which is reflected in the deep trenches of the western Pacific. Here the bottoms of the Marianas and the Tonga–Kermadec trenches are up to below sea level. In the eastern Pacific, where the subducting oceanic lithosphere is much younger, the depth of the Peru-Chile trench is around .

Though narrow, oceanic trenches are remarkably long and continuous, forming the largest linear depressions on earth. An individual trench can be thousands of kilometers long. Most trenches are convex towards the subducting slab, which is attributed to the spherical geometry of the Earth.

The trench asymmetry reflects the different physical mechanisms that determine the inner and outer slope angle. The outer slope angle of the trench is determined by the bending radius of the subducting slab, as determined by its elastic thickness. Since oceanic lithosphere thickens with age, the outer slope angle is ultimately determined by the age of the subducting slab. The inner slope angle is determined by the angle of repose of the overriding plate edge. This reflects frequent earthquakes along the trench that prevent oversteepening of the inner slope.

As the subducting plate approaches the trench, it bends slightly upwards before beginning its plunge into the depths. As a result, the outer trench slope is bounded by an &quot;outer trench high&quot;. This is subtle, often only tens of meters high, and is typically located a few tens of kilometers from the trench axis. On the outer slope itself, where the plate begins to bend downwards into the trench, the upper part of the subducting slab is broken by bending faults that give the outer trench slope a horst and graben topography. The formation of these bending faults is suppressed where oceanic ridges or large seamounts are subducting into the trench, but the bending faults cut right across smaller seamounts. Where the subducting slab is only thinly veneered with sediments, the outer slope will often show seafloor spreading ridges oblique to the horst and graben ridges.

=== Sedimentation ===
Trench morphology is strongly modified by the amount of sedimentation in the trench. This varies from practically no sedimentation, as in the Tonga-Kermadec trench, to completely filled with sediments, as with the Cascadia subduction zone. Sedimentation is largely controlled by whether the trench is near a continental sediment source. The range of sedimentation is well illustrated by the Chilean trench. The north Chile portion of the trench, which lies along the Atacama Desert with its very slow rate of weathering, is sediment-starved, with from 20 to a few hundred meters of sediments on the trench floor. The tectonic morphology of this trench segment is fully exposed on the ocean bottom. The central Chile segment of the trench is moderately sedimented, with sediments onlapping onto pelagic sediments or ocean basement of the subducting slab, but the trench morphology is still clearly discernible. The southern Chile segment of the trench is fully sedimented, to the point where the outer rise and slope are no longer discernible. Other fully sedimented trenches include the Makran Trough, where sediments are up to thick; the Cascadia subduction zone, which is completed buried by of sediments; and the northernmost Sumatra subduction zone, which is buried under of sediments.

Sediments are sometimes transported along the axis of an oceanic trench. The central Chile trench experiences transport of sediments from source fans along an axial channel. Similar transport of sediments has been documented in the Aleutian trench.

In addition to sedimentation from rivers draining into a trench, sedimentation also takes place from landslides on the tectonically steepened inner slope, often driven by megathrust earthquakes. The Reloca Slide of the central Chile trench is an example of this process.

=== Erosive versus accretionary margins ===
Convergent margins are classified as erosive or accretionary, and this has a strong influence on the morphology of the inner slope of the trench. Erosive margins, such as the northern Peru-Chile, Tonga-Kermadec, and Mariana trenches, correspond to sediment-starved trenches. The subducting slab erodes material from the lower part of the overriding slab, reducing its volume. The edge of the slab experiences subsidence and steepening, with normal faulting. The slope is underlain by relative strong igneous and metamorphic rock, which maintains a high angle of repose. Over half of all convergent margins are erosive margins.

Accretionary margins, such as the southern Peru-Chile, Cascadia, and Aleutians, are associated with moderately to heavily sedimented trenches. As the slab subducts, sediments are &quot;bulldozed&quot; onto the edge of the overriding plate, producing an &quot;accretionary wedge&quot; or &quot;accretionary prism&quot;. This builds the overriding plate outwards. Because the sediments lack strength, their angle of repose is gentler than the rock making up the inner slope of erosive margin trenches. The inner slope is underlain by imbricated thrust sheets of sediments. The inner slope topography is roughened by localized mass wasting. Cascadia has practically no bathymetric expression of the outer rise and trench, due to complete sediment filling, but the inner trench slope is complex, with many thrust ridges. These compete with canyon formation by rivers draining into the trench. Inner trench slopes of erosive margins rarely show thrust ridges.

Accretionary prisms grow in two ways. The first is by frontal accretion, in which sediments are scraped off the downgoing plate and emplaced at the front of the accretionary prism. As the accretionary wedge grows, older sediments further from the trench become increasingly lithified, and faults and other structural features are steepened by rotation towards the trench. The other mechanism for accretionary prism growth is underplating (also known as basal accretion) of subducted sediments, together with some oceanic crust, along the shallow parts of the subduction decollement. The Franciscan Group of California is interpreted as an ancient accretionary prism in which underplating is recorded as tectonic mélanges and duplex structures.


=== Earthquakes ===
Frequent megathrust earthquakes modify the inner slope of the trench by triggering massive landslides. These leave semicircular landslide scarps with slopes of up to 20 degrees on the headwalls and sidewalls.

Subduction of seamounts and aseismic ridges into the trench may increase aseismic creep and reduce the severity of earthquakes. Contrariwise, subduction of large amounts of sediments may allow ruptures along the subduction décollement to propagate for great distances to produce megathrust earthquakes.

== Trench rollback ==
Trenches seem positionally stable over time, but scientists believe that some trenches—particularly those associated with subduction zones where two oceanic plates converge—move backward into the subducting plate. This is called trench rollback or hinge retreat (also hinge rollback) and is one explanation for the existence of back-arc basins.
Forces perpendicular to the slab (the portion of the subducting plate within the mantle) are responsible for steepening of the slab and, ultimately, the movement of the hinge and trench at the surface. These forces arise from the negative buoyancy of the slab with respect to the mantle modified by the geometry of the slab itself. The extension in the overriding plate, in response to the subsequent subhorizontal mantle flow from the displacement of the slab, can result in formation of a back-arc basin.

===Processes involved===

Several forces are involved in the process of slab rollback. Two forces acting against each other at the interface of the two subducting plates exert forces against one another. The subducting plate exerts a bending force (FPB) that supplies pressure during subduction, while the overriding plate exerts a force against the subducting plate (FTS). The slab pull force (FSP) is caused by the negative buoyancy of the plate driving the plate to greater depths. The resisting force from the surrounding mantle opposes the slab pull forces. Interactions with the 660-km discontinuity cause a deflection due to the buoyancy at the phase transition (F660). The unique interplay of these forces is what generates slab rollback. When the deep slab section obstructs the down-going motion of the shallow slab section, slab rollback occurs. The subducting slab undergoes backward sinking due to the negative buoyancy forces causing a retrogradation of the trench hinge along the surface. Upwelling of the mantle around the slab can create favorable conditions for the formation of a back-arc basin.

Seismic tomography provides evidence for slab rollback. Results demonstrate high temperature anomalies within the mantle suggesting subducted material is present in the mantle. Ophiolites are viewed as evidence for such mechanisms as high pressure and temperature rocks are rapidly brought to the surface through the processes of slab rollback, which provides space for the exhumation of ophiolites.

Slab rollback is not always a continuous process suggesting an episodic nature. The episodic nature of the rollback is explained by a change in the density of the subducting plate, such as the arrival of buoyant lithosphere (a continent, arc, ridge, or plateau), a change in the subduction dynamics, or a change in the plate kinematics. The age of the subducting plates does not have any effect on slab rollback. Nearby continental collisions have an effect on slab rollback. Continental collisions induce mantle flow and extrusion of mantle material, which causes stretching and arc-trench rollback. In the area of the Southeast Pacific, there have been several rollback events resulting in the formation of numerous back-arc basins.

===Mantle interactions===

Interactions with the mantle discontinuities play a significant role in slab rollback. Stagnation at the 660-km discontinuity causes retrograde slab motion due to the suction forces acting at the surface. Slab rollback induces mantle return flow, which causes extension from the shear stresses at the base of the overriding plate. As slab rollback velocities increase, circular mantle flow velocities also increase, accelerating extension rates. Extension rates are altered when the slab interacts with the discontinuities within the mantle at 410 km and 660 km depth. Slabs can either penetrate directly into the lower mantle, or can be retarded due to the phase transition at 660 km depth creating a difference in buoyancy. An increase in retrograde trench migration (slab rollback) (2–4 cm/yr) is a result of flattened slabs at the 660-km discontinuity where the slab does not penetrate into the lower mantle. This is the case for the Japan, Java and Izu–Bonin trenches. These flattened slabs are only temporarily arrested in the transition zone. The subsequent displacement into the lower mantle is caused by slab pull forces, or the destabilization of the slab from warming and broadening due to thermal diffusion. Slabs that penetrate directly into the lower mantle result in slower slab rollback rates (~1–3 cm/yr) such as the Mariana arc, Tonga arcs.

== Hydrothermal activity and associated biomes ==

As sediments are subducted at the bottom of trenches, much of their fluid content is expelled and moves back along the subduction décollement to emerge on the inner slope as mud volcanoes and cold seeps. Methane clathrates and gas hydrates also accumulate in the inner slope, and there is concern that their breakdown could contribute to global warming.

The fluids released at mud volcanoes and cold seeps are rich in methane and hydrogen sulfide, providing chemical energy for chemotrophic microorganisms that form the base of a unique trench biome. Cold seep communities have been identified in the inner trench slopes of the western Pacific (especially Japan), South America, Barbados, the Mediterranean, Makran, and the Sunda trench. These are found at depths as great as . The genome of the extremophile &quot;Deinococcus&quot; from Challenger Deep has sequenced for its ecological insights and potential industrial uses.

Because trenches are the lowest points in the ocean floor, there is concern that plastic debris may accumulate in trenches and endanger the fragile trench biomes.

== Deepest oceanic trenches ==
Recent measurements, where the salinity and temperature of the water was measured throughout the dive, have uncertainties of about . Older measurements may be off by hundreds of meters.

<text>Seafloor spreading, or seafloor spread, is a process that occurs at mid-ocean ridges, where new oceanic crust is formed through volcanic activity and then gradually moves away from the ridge.

==History of study==
Earlier theories by Alfred Wegener and Alexander du Toit of continental drift postulated that continents in motion &quot;plowed&quot; through the fixed and immovable seafloor. The idea that the seafloor itself moves and also carries the continents with it as it spreads from a central rift axis was proposed by Harold Hammond Hess from Princeton University and Robert Dietz of the U.S. Naval Electronics Laboratory in San Diego in the 1960s. The phenomenon is known today as plate tectonics. In locations where two plates move apart, at mid-ocean ridges, new seafloor is continually formed during seafloor spreading.

==Significance==
Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate slab pull at subduction zones, rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges. Plates that are not subducting are driven by gravity sliding off the elevated mid-ocean ridges a process called ridge push. At a spreading center, basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed. Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone.

&quot;Spreading rate&quot; is the rate at which an ocean basin widens due to seafloor spreading. (The rate at which new oceanic lithosphere is added to each tectonic plate on either side of a mid-ocean ridge is the &quot;spreading half-rate&quot; and is equal to half of the spreading rate). Spreading rates determine if the ridge is fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges have spreading (opening) rates of more than 90 mm/year. Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 40–90 mm/year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 40 mm/year. The highest known rate was over 200 mm/yr during the Miocene on the East Pacific Rise. 

In the 1960s, the past record of geomagnetic reversals of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field was noticed by observing magnetic stripe &quot;anomalies&quot; on the ocean floor. This results in broadly evident &quot;stripes&quot; from which the past magnetic field polarity can be inferred from data gathered with a magnetometer towed on the sea surface or from an aircraft. The stripes on one side of the mid-ocean ridge were the mirror image of those on the other side. By identifying a reversal with a known age and measuring the distance of that reversal from the spreading center, the spreading half-rate could be computed. 

In some locations spreading rates have been found to be asymmetric; the half rates differ on each side of the ridge crest by about five percent. This is thought due to temperature gradients in the asthenosphere from mantle plumes near the spreading center.

== Spreading centers ==
Seafloor spreading occurs at spreading centers, distributed along the crests of mid-ocean ridges. Spreading centers end in transform faults or in overlapping spreading center offsets. A spreading center includes a seismically active plate boundary zone a few kilometers to tens of kilometers wide, a crustal accretion zone within the boundary zone where the ocean crust is youngest, and an instantaneous plate boundary – a line within the crustal accretion zone demarcating the two separating plates. Within the crustal accretion zone is a 1–2 km-wide neovolcanic zone where active volcanism occurs.

== Incipient spreading ==

In the general case, seafloor spreading starts as a rift in a continental land mass, similar to the Red Sea-East Africa Rift System today. The process starts by heating at the base of the continental crust which causes it to become more plastic and less dense. Because less dense objects rise in relation to denser objects, the area being heated becomes a broad dome (see isostasy). As the crust bows upward, fractures occur that gradually grow into rifts. The typical rift system consists of three rift arms at approximately 120-degree angles. These areas are named triple junctions and can be found in several places across the world today. The separated margins of the continents evolve to form passive margins. Hess&#x27; theory was that new seafloor is formed when magma is forced upward toward the surface at a mid-ocean ridge.

If spreading continues past the incipient stage described above, two of the rift arms will open while the third arm stops opening and becomes a &#x27;failed rift&#x27; or aulacogen. As the two active rifts continue to open, eventually the continental crust is attenuated as far as it will stretch. At this point basaltic oceanic crust and upper mantle lithosphere begins to form between the separating continental fragments. When one of the rifts opens into the existing ocean, the rift system is flooded with seawater and becomes a new sea. The Red Sea is an example of a new arm of the sea. The East African rift was thought to be a failed arm that was opening more slowly than the other two arms, but in 2005 the Ethiopian Afar Geophysical Lithospheric Experiment reported that in the Afar region, September 2005, a 60 km fissure opened as wide as eight meters. During this period of initial flooding the new sea is sensitive to changes in climate and eustasy. As a result, the new sea will evaporate (partially or completely) several times before the elevation of the rift valley has been lowered to the point that the sea becomes stable. During this period of evaporation large evaporite deposits will be made in the rift valley. Later these deposits have the potential to become hydrocarbon seals and are of particular interest to petroleum geologists.

Seafloor spreading can stop during the process, but if it continues to the point that the continent is completely severed, then a new ocean basin is created. The Red Sea has not yet completely split Arabia from Africa, but a similar feature can be found on the other side of Africa that has broken completely free. South America once fit into the area of the Niger Delta. The Niger River has formed in the failed rift arm of the triple junction.

==Continued spreading and subduction==

As new seafloor forms and spreads apart from the mid-ocean ridge it slowly cools over time. Older seafloor is, therefore, colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world&#x27;s most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 145 ± 4 mm/yr between the Pacific and Nazca plates. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.

Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world&#x27;s ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean.

==Debate and search for mechanism==
At the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (and in other mid-ocean ridges), material from the upper mantle rises through the faults between oceanic plates to form new crust as the plates move away from each other, a phenomenon first observed as continental drift. When Alfred Wegener first presented a hypothesis of continental drift in 1912, he suggested that continents plowed through the ocean crust. This was impossible: oceanic crust is both more dense and more rigid than continental crust. Accordingly, Wegener&#x27;s theory wasn&#x27;t taken very seriously, especially in the United States.

At first the driving force for spreading was argued to be convection currents in the mantle. Since then, it has been shown that the motion of the continents is linked to seafloor spreading by the theory of plate tectonics, which is driven by convection that includes the crust itself as well.

The driver for seafloor spreading in plates with active margins is the weight of the cool, dense, subducting slabs that pull them along, or slab pull. The magmatism at the ridge is considered to be passive upwelling, which is caused by the plates being pulled apart under the weight of their own slabs. This can be thought of as analogous to a rug on a table with little friction: when part of the rug is off of the table, its weight pulls the rest of the rug down with it. However, the Mid-Atlantic ridge itself is not bordered by plates that are being pulled into subduction zones, except the minor subduction in the Lesser Antilles and Scotia Arc. In this case the plates are sliding apart over the mantle upwelling in the process of ridge push.

==Seafloor global topography: cooling models==

The depth of the seafloor (or the height of a location on a mid-ocean ridge above a base-level) is closely correlated with its age (age of the lithosphere where depth is measured). The age-depth relation can be modeled by the cooling of a lithosphere plate or mantle half-space in areas without significant subduction.

===Cooling mantle model===
In the mantle half-space model, the seabed height is determined by the oceanic lithosphere and mantle temperature, due to thermal expansion. The simple result is that the ridge height or ocean depth is proportional to the square root of its age. Oceanic lithosphere is continuously formed at a constant rate at the mid-ocean ridges. The source of the lithosphere has a half-plane shape (&quot;x&quot; = 0, &quot;z&quot; &lt; 0) and a constant temperature &quot;T&quot;1. Due to its continuous creation, the lithosphere at &quot;x&quot; &gt; 0 is moving away from the ridge at a constant velocity &quot;v&quot;, which is assumed large compared to other typical scales in the problem. The temperature at the upper boundary of the lithosphere (&quot;z&quot; = 0) is a constant &quot;T&quot;0 = 0. Thus at &quot;x&quot; = 0 the temperature is the Heaviside step function formula_1. The system is assumed to be at a quasi-steady state, so that the temperature distribution is constant in time, i.e. formula_2

By calculating in the frame of reference of the moving lithosphere (velocity &quot;v&quot;), which has spatial coordinate formula_3 formula_4 and the heat equation is:

:formula_5

where formula_6 is the thermal diffusivity of the mantle lithosphere.

Since &quot;T&quot; depends on &quot;x&quot;&#x27; and &quot;t&quot; only through the combination formula_7:

:formula_8

Thus:

:formula_9

It is assumed that formula_10 is large compared to other scales in the problem; therefore the last term in the equation is neglected, giving a 1-dimensional diffusion equation:

:formula_11

with the initial conditions

:formula_12

The solution for formula_13 is given by the error function:

:formula_14.

Due to the large velocity, the temperature dependence on the horizontal direction is negligible, and the height at time &quot;t&quot; (i.e. of sea floor of age &quot;t&quot;) can be calculated by integrating the thermal expansion over &quot;z&quot;:

:formula_15

where formula_16 is the effective volumetric thermal expansion coefficient, and &quot;h0&quot; is the mid-ocean ridge height (compared to some reference).

The assumption that &quot;v&quot; is relatively large is equivalent to the assumption that the thermal diffusivity formula_6 is small compared to formula_18, where &quot;L&quot; is the ocean width (from mid-ocean ridges to continental shelf) and &quot;A&quot; is the age of the ocean basin.

The effective thermal expansion coefficient formula_16 is different from the usual thermal expansion coefficient formula_20 due to isostasic effect of the change in water column height above the lithosphere as it expands or retracts. Both coefficients are related by:

:formula_21

where formula_22 is the rock density and formula_23 is the density of water.

By substituting the parameters by their rough estimates:

:formula_24

gives:

:formula_25

where the height is in meters and time is in millions of years. To get the dependence on &quot;x&quot;, one must substitute &quot;t&quot; = &quot;x&quot;/&quot;v&quot; ~ &quot;Ax&quot;/&quot;L&quot;, where &quot;L&quot; is the distance between the ridge to the continental shelf (roughly half the ocean width), and &quot;A&quot; is the ocean basin age.

Rather than height of the ocean floor formula_26 above a base or reference level formula_27, the depth of the ocean formula_28 is of interest. Because formula_29(with formula_27 measured from the ocean surface):

:formula_31; for the eastern Pacific for example, where formula_32 is the depth at the ridge crest, typically 2600 m.

===Cooling plate model===

The depth predicted by the square root of seafloor age derived above is too deep for seafloor older than 80 million years. Depth is better explained by a cooling lithosphere plate model rather than the cooling mantle half-space. The plate has a constant temperature at its base and spreading edge. Analysis of depth versus age and depth versus square root of age data allowed Parsons and Sclater to estimate model parameters (for the North Pacific):

:~125 km for lithosphere thickness
:formula_33 at base and young edge of plate
:formula_34

Assuming isostatic equilibrium everywhere beneath the cooling plate yields a revised age depth relationship for older sea floor that is approximately correct for ages as young as 20 million years:

:formula_35 meters

Thus older seafloor deepens more slowly than younger and in fact can be assumed almost constant at ~6400 m depth. Parsons and Sclater concluded that some style of mantle convection must apply heat to the base of the plate everywhere to prevent cooling down below 125 km and lithosphere contraction (seafloor deepening) at older ages. Their plate model also allowed an expression for conductive heat flow, &quot;q(t)&quot; from the ocean floor, which is approximately constant at formula_36 beyond 120 million years:

<doc id="145699" wikidata="Q2998209" url="?curid=145699" title="Mantle (monastic vesture)">
<text>A mantle (; ) is an ecclesiastical garment in the form of a very full cape that extends to the floor, joined at the neck, that is worn over the outer garments. Especially in the case of Elijah, it was likely a tallit, a Hebrew garment that housed the fringes still seen today which are also translated at “the hem of His garment” in the New Testament. It is also likely that further ecclesiastical garments were based originally on this one.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church, the mantle is a monastic garment worn by bishops, hegumens, archimandrites, and other monastics in processions and while attending various church services, such as Vespers or Matins; but not when vested to celebrate the Divine Liturgy. Unlike the Western cope, the mantle is worn only by monastics. The klobuk is worn over the mantle.

Christian knights, many of whom take monastic vows, wear a mantle as well, often containing Christian symbols. Knights of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, for example, wear a white mantle with a Jerusalem cross that represents the Five Holy Wounds of Jesus.

== History ==

The mantle was originally a cape worn simply to ward off the cold. The mantle was first mentioned in the Old Testament, as a garment worn by several prophets including Elijah and Elisha. In , the mantle passing from Elijah the prophet, to Elisha, his successor, symbolizes the passing of prophetic authority: 
:And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. 
:And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces. 
:He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan; 
:And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over. 

Depictions of monks on icons show the mantle in use from the earliest Christian times. The original monastic mantle was of simple material: black, brown or grey, depending on what was at hand. As time went on, the use of mantles of a particular color and style came to be established as specific monastic vesture. Over the years distinguishing colors and ornamentation came to be applied to the mantle to distinguish monastics of higher positions within the church, while still reminding them of the need for monastic humility.

In the contemporary practice of the Eastern Orthodox Church, monks and nuns wear solid black mantles. They also wear veils, differing between traditions and rank. In common practice, monks wear a black veil that covers a Kalimavkion, a cylindrical hat. Abbesses also wear this same veil and hat while nuns only wear the veil. The practice of wearing a kalimavkion below the veil has only arisen in the last 300 years, and prior to this period, monks either wore no veil, or wore a pointed veil, as seen in many Russians of the old rite and icons of African saints. Nuns have been wearing a veil, in addition to the mantle since at least the 11th Century.

==Monastics==
The monastic mantle is worn by Orthodox Christian monks and nuns of the Lesser Schema and Great Schema. In the Greek practice the use of the mantle by those of the Lesser Schema is less common. (It is not worn by Rassaphores). The mantle worn by a simple monk or nun is black (black being the traditional monastic color, symbolizing mourning over one&#x27;s sins and a reminder of the vow of poverty), joined at the neck and hanging down to the feet. In the Russian tradition, the mantle is usually pleated (33 pleats for the number of years in the earthly life of Jesus). It may or may not have a train. Over the centuries, much symbolic meaning has come to be attributed to the mantle: 

&quot;[The] mantle is a monastic vestment, which covers the whole person with the exception of the head. Its freely flowing lines typify the wings of the Angels; hence it is called &quot;the Angelic vestment.&quot; The folds of the Mantle are symbolical of the all-embracing power of God; and also of the strictness, piety and meekness of the monastic life; and that the hands and other members of a monk do not live, and are not fitted for worldly activity, but are all dead.&quot;

&quot;[The mantle] is called &#x27;the garment of incorruption and purity&#x27; [in the text of the Tonsure ceremony], and the absence of sleeves is to remind the monk that he is debarred from worldly pursuits. The mantle is given him in token of the &#x27;exalted angelic state&#x27; which he assumes&quot;

The mantle is bestowed upon a monk when he becomes as Stavrophore (Lesser Schema), for which reason this rank of monk is sometimes referred to as a &quot;mantle monk&quot;. The mantle is bestowed a second time if he becomes a Schemamonk (Greater Schema).

An Hegumen (Abbot) or Hegumenia (Abbess) wears the simple monastic mantle.

When an Orthodox monk or nun dies, they are vested in their religious habit. A strip of cloth is torn from the bottom of their mantle and is used to bind their body three times: around the chest, around the waist, and around the feet.

==Archimandrites==
The mantle worn by an archimandrite will be joined in front at the bottom as well as at the neck, and will have &quot;tablets&quot; or &quot;pectorals&quot; (Greek: πόματα, &quot;pómata&quot;; Slavonic: &quot;skrizhali&quot;)—rectangular pieces of red or green cloth sewn onto the corners of the mantle (i.e., two at the neck and two at the feet). The upper two tablets (those at the neck) will often be embroidered with crosses. The tablets symbolize the fact that the Archimandrite will guide the brethren according to the commandments of God. The four tablets are symbolic of the Old and the New Testaments, and of the Four Gospels.

When an archimandrite dies, his mantle is laid on his coffin in place of a funeral pall.

==Bishops==
There is also an episcopal mantle which is not worn with the other episcopal vestments while celebrating the Divine Liturgy, but when the bishop formally enters the church beforehand, or when a bishop is formally attending (i.e., presiding over) a service in which he is not serving. Among the Greeks, it is common for all bishops regardless of rank, to wear a red mantle; however, many also use purple during Great Lent. In the Slavic tradition, a more complex color scheme has developed, and hierarchs wear different-colored mantles according to their rank: violet for bishops; plum for archbishops; blue for metropolitans; and green for patriarchs in the Russian tradition. Different national churches have different traditions regarding the colors worn by bishops.

In the Russian tradition, the episcopal mantiya is characteristically decorated with red and white horizontal ribbons, called &quot;rivers&quot; or &quot;streams&quot; (Greek: ποταμοί, &quot;potamoí&quot;; Slavonic: &quot;Istochniki&quot;), symbolizing the word of God going out into the entire world (, , ). Among the Greeks, these rivers are usually gold.

The tablets on the Bishop&#x27;s mantle may be more finely embroidered or made of more costly material than those on the mantle of an archimandrite. The upper tablets (those at the neck) may be embroidered with icons; those at the feet may be embroidered with the bishop&#x27;s monogram. The episcopal tablets symbolise the four Gospels which must be the focus of a bishop&#x27;s teachings. The episcopal mantle always has a train on it, and may have small bells attached as well, recalling the bells attached to the Robe of the High Priest ().

In general, when a bishop celebrates any service other than the Divine Liturgy (or when he is attending, but not celebrating Liturgy), he will wear the mantle with the Epitrachelion, the Omophorion (the latter being worn outside the mantle), and, in some liturgical traditions, the Cuffs. He will also stand on an orlets.

When a bishop dies, his mantle is laid on his coffin in place of a funeral pall.

==Knights==

Christian knights who are members of military orders, such as the Order of Saint John and the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, wear a mantle.

<doc id="145700" wikidata="Q4232578" url="?curid=145700" title="Crust (geology)">
<text>In geology, the crust is the outermost solid shell of a planet, dwarf planet, or natural satellite. It is usually distinguished from the underlying mantle by its chemical makeup; however, in the case of icy satellites, it may be defined based on its phase (solid crust vs. liquid mantle).

The crusts of Earth, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Io, the Moon and other planetary bodies formed via igneous processes and were later modified by erosion, impact cratering, volcanism, and sedimentation.

Most terrestrial planets have fairly uniform crusts. Earth, however, has two distinct types: continental crust and oceanic crust. These two types have different chemical compositions and physical properties and were formed by different geological processes.

== Types of crust ==

Planetary geologists divide crust into three categories based on how and when it formed.

=== Primary crust / primordial crust ===
This is a planet&#x27;s &quot;original&quot; crust. It forms from solidification of a magma ocean. Toward the end of planetary accretion, the terrestrial planets likely had surfaces that were magma oceans. As these cooled, they solidified into crust. This crust was likely destroyed by large impacts and re-formed many times as the Era of Heavy Bombardment drew to a close. 

The nature of primary crust is still debated: its chemical, mineralogic, and physical properties are unknown, as are the igneous mechanisms that formed them. This is because it is difficult to study: none of Earth&#x27;s primary crust has survived to today. Earth&#x27;s high rates of erosion and crustal recycling from plate tectonics has destroyed all rocks older than about 4 billion years, including whatever primary crust Earth once had. 

However, geologists can glean information about primary crust by studying it on other terrestrial planets. Mercury&#x27;s highlands might represent primary crust, though this is debated. The anorthosite highlands of the Moon are primary crust, formed as plagioclase crystallized out of the Moon&#x27;s initial magma ocean and floated to the top; however, it is unlikely that Earth followed a similar pattern, as the Moon was a water-less system and Earth had water. The Martian meteorite ALH84001 might represent primary crust of Mars; however, again, this is debated. Like Earth, Venus lacks primary crust, as the entire planet has been repeatedly resurfaced and modified.

=== Secondary crust ===
Secondary crust is formed by partial melting of mostly silicate materials in the mantle, and so is usually basaltic in composition.

This is the most common type of crust in the Solar System. Most of the surfaces of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars comprise secondary crust, as do the lunar maria. On Earth secondary crust forms primarily at mid-ocean spreading centers, where the adiabatic rise of mantle causes partial melting.

=== Tertiary crust ===
Tertiary crust is more chemically-modified than either primary or secondary. It can form in several ways:
* Igneous processes: partial-melting of secondary crust, coupled with differentiation or dehydration
* Erosion and sedimentation: sediments derived from primary, secondary, or tertiary crust
The only known example of tertiary crust is the continental crust of the Earth. It is unknown whether other terrestrial planets can be said to have tertiary crust, though the evidence so far suggests that they do not. This is likely because plate tectonics is needed to create tertiary crust, and Earth is the only planet in the Solar System with plate tectonics.

==Earth&#x27;s crust==


Earth&#x27;s crust is a thin shell on the outside of Earth, accounting for less than 1% of Earth&#x27;s volume. It is the top component of the lithosphere, a division of Earth&#x27;s layers that includes the crust and the upper part of the mantle. The lithosphere is broken into tectonic plates that move, allowing heat to escape from the interior of Earth into space.

== Moon&#x27;s crust ==

A theoretical protoplanet named &quot;Theia&quot; is thought to have collided with the forming Earth, and part of the material ejected into space by the collision accreted to form the Moon. As the Moon formed, the outer part of it is thought to have been molten, a &quot;lunar magma ocean&quot;. Plagioclase feldspar crystallized in large amounts from this magma ocean and floated toward the surface. The cumulate rocks form much of the crust. The upper part of the crust probably averages about 88% plagioclase (near the lower limit of 90% defined for anorthosite): the lower part of the crust may contain a higher percentage of ferromagnesian minerals such as the pyroxenes and olivine, but even that lower part probably averages about 78% plagioclase. The underlying mantle is denser and olivine-rich.

The thickness of the crust ranges between about 20 and 120 km. Crust on the far side of the Moon averages about 12 km thicker than that on the near side. Estimates of average thickness fall in the range from about 50 to 60 km. Most of this plagioclase-rich crust formed shortly after formation of the Moon, between about 4.5 and 4.3 billion years ago. Perhaps 10% or less of the crust consists of igneous rock added after the formation of the initial plagioclase-rich material. The best-characterized and most voluminous of these later additions are the mare basalts formed between about 3.9 and 3.2 billion years ago. Minor volcanism continued after 3.2 billion years, perhaps as recently as 1 billion years ago. There is no evidence of plate tectonics.

Study of the Moon has established that a crust can form on a rocky planetary body significantly smaller than Earth. Although the radius of the Moon is only about a quarter that of Earth, the lunar crust has a significantly greater average thickness. This thick crust formed almost immediately after formation of the Moon. Magmatism continued after the period of intense meteorite impacts ended about 3.9 billion years ago, but igneous rocks younger than 3.9 billion years make up only a minor part of the crust.

<text>Gondwana, also known as Gondaranya, the land of Gondwana, is a region of India named after the Gondi people. The supercontinent, Gondwanaland, was named after the Gondwana region, because it contained some ancient fossil-bearing rock formations.

Since Gondi people are spread widely across central India, the region has no unambiguous boundary. However, the core region can be considered to be the eastern part of the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, Garha Kingdom the parts of Madhya Pradesh immediately to the north of it, and parts of the west of Chhattisgarh. The wider region extends into parts of northern Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, western Odisha and southern Uttar Pradesh.

The region is part of the northern Deccan plateau, with an average height of about 600–700 metres. Geologically, it is mostly Precambrian rock, with some areas of Permian and Triassic age. In places, these older rocks are overlain with alluvium, while in the west, it is overlain by the igneous rocks of the Deccan Traps. The landscape is generally rugged and hilly.

The climate is hot and semi-arid. Large sections are forest, specifically dry monsoon forest and monsoon scrub forest. Gondwana contains several national parks with tiger populations.

Gondwana has a relatively high proportion of people from the &quot;scheduled tribes&quot; of India, including the Gonds. The scheduled tribes are recognised as economically and socially disadvantaged. Gonds are followers of religion based on Gondi.

==History==
A number of old kingdoms were established by ruling families of the Gondis and other scheduled tribes in this region. The first of these was mentioned in 1398, when Narsingh Rai, King of Kherla, Madhya Pradesh, is said to have ruled all the hills of Gondwana. He was overthrown and killed by Hoshang Shah, king of Malwa. From the 14th to the 18th centuries, three main Gond kingdoms existed: Garha-Mandla occupied the upper Narmada River Valley, Deogarh-Nagpur occupied the Kanhan River and upper Wainganga River valleys, and Chandra-Sirpur occupied present-day Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, and eastern Adilabad districts. 

The three Gondi principalities of Garha-Mandla, Deogarh, and Chanda-Sirpur were nominally subject to the Mughal emperors. After the annexation of Berar in 1595, the Mughals established governors at Paunar in Wardha District and Kherla in Betul District. However, the Mughals could not assert sovereignty over them, and the Gond kings enjoyed independence within their dominions and hence, Gondwana wasn&#x27;t under the Mughal imperial administration. After the fall of the Mughals, Gondwana came under the rule of the Bundela and Maratha empires.

In the 17th century Chhatar Sal, the Bundela deprived the Mandla principality of part of the Vindhyan Plateau and the Narmada Valley. In 1733 the Maratha Peshwa won Bundelkhand; and in 1735 the Marathas had established their power in Saugor. In 1742 the Peshwa advanced to Mandla, and from this time until 1781, when Gond dynasty of Garha-Mandla was finally overthrown, Garha-Mandla was practically a Maratha dependency. Meanwhile, the other independent principalities of Gondwana had in turn fallen. In 1743 Raghoji Bhonsle of Berar established himself at Nagpur and by 1751 had conquered the territories of Deogarh, Chanda, and Chhattisgarh.

The Maratha conquest of the region in the 18th century was followed by the British imposition of permanent settlement in the 19th century. A number of rebellions against British rule took place throughout the 19th century, some of which focused on the protection of forests against commercial logging.

==Emblem of Gondwana State==

The emblem of Gondwana is of a lion, triumphing over an elephant. This visual trope, of a triumphant lion vanquishing one or more elephants, is common in architectural sculpture. There are many minor variations on this motif, including the use of leonine creatures variously described as vyālas or yālīs, and the incorporation of other fantastic creatures such as makaras. Many Gondwana Kingdom forts constructed between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries carried this representation on their barbicans and gateways.

== Gondwana Express ==

The Gondwana express train runs between Raigarh and Hazrat Nizamuddin in India. It is a 5-day service. It operates as train number 12409 from Raigarh to Hazrat Nizamuddin and as train number 12410 in the reverse direction after the name of Gondwana kingdom.

==Popular movements==

Political and communal movements against the dominant political structure still occur in the region, including the Gondwana Praja Party, founded in 2014 in Maharashtra state. This party was founded to demand the new formation of the old Gondwana State for the tribal people of central India. There is also the Gondwana Ganatantra Party, founded by Heera Singh Markam.

<doc id="145703" wikidata="Q132033" url="?curid=145703" title="Laurasia">
<text>Laurasia () was the more northern of two large landmasses that formed part of the Pangaea supercontinent from around (Mya), the other being Gondwana. It separated from Gondwana (beginning in the late Triassic period) during the breakup of Pangaea, drifting farther north after the split and finally broke apart with the opening of the North Atlantic Ocean 56 Mya. The name is a portmanteau of Laurentia and Eurasia.

Laurentia, Avalonia, Baltica, and a series of smaller terranes, collided in the Caledonian orogeny c. 400 Mya to form Laurussia. Laurussia then collided with Gondwana to form Pangaea. Kazakhstania and Siberia were then added to Pangaea 290–300 Mya to form Laurasia. Laurasia finally became an independent continental mass when Pangaea broke up into Gondwana and Laurasia.

==Terminology and origin of the concept==
Laurentia, the Palaeozoic core of North America and continental fragments that now make up part of Europe, collided with Baltica and Avalonia in the Caledonian orogeny from c. 430–420 Mya to form Laurussia. In the Late Carboniferous, Laurussia and Gondwana collided and formed Pangaea. Siberia and Kazakhstania finally collided with Baltica in the Late Permian to form Laurasia. A series of continental blocks that now form East Asia and Southeast Asia were later added to Laurasia.

In 1904–1909, Austrian geologist Eduard Suess proposed that the continents in the Southern Hemisphere were once merged into a larger continent called Gondwana. In 1915, German meteorologist Alfred Wegener proposed the existence of a supercontinent that he called Pangaea. In 1937, South African geologist Alexander du Toit proposed that Pangaea was divided into two larger landmasses, Laurasia in the Northern Hemisphere and Gondwana in the Southern Hemisphere, separated by the Tethys Ocean.

&quot;Laurussia&quot; was defined by Swiss geologist Peter Ziegler in 1988 as the merger between Laurentia and Baltica along the northern Caledonian suture. The &quot;Old Red Continent&quot; is an informal name often used for the Silurian-Carboniferous deposits in the central landmass of Laurussia.

Several earlier supercontinents proposed and debated in the 1990s and later (e.g. Rodinia, Nuna, Nena) included earlier connections between Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia. These original connections apparently survived through one and possibly even two Wilson Cycles, though their intermittent duration and recurrent fit is debated.

==Proto-Laurasia==
===Pre–Rodinia===

Laurentia and Baltica first formed a continental mass known as Proto-Laurasia as part of the supercontinent Columbia which was assembled 2,100–1,800 Mya to encompass virtually all known Archaean continental blocks. Surviving sutures from this assembly are the Trans-Hudson orogen in Laurentia; Nagssugtoqidian orogen in Greenland; the Kola-Karelian (the northwest margin of the Svecofennian orogen) and the Volhyn—Central Russia orogen and Pachelma orogen (across western Russia) in Baltica, the Akitkan Orogen in Siberia.

Additional Proterozoic crust was accreted 1,800–1,300 Mya, especially along the Laurentia—Greenland—Baltica margin. Laurentia and Baltica formed a coherent continental mass with southern Greenland and Labrador adjacent to the Arctic margin of Baltica. A magmatic arc extended from Laurentia through southern Greenland to northern Baltica. The breakup of Columbia began 1,600 Mya, including along the western margin of Laurentia and northern margin of Baltica (modern coordinates), and was completed c. 1,300–1,200 Mya, a period during which mafic dike swarms were emplaced, including MacKenzie and Sudbury in Laurentia.

Traces left by large igneous provinces provide evidences for continental mergers during this period. Those related to Proto-Laurasia includes:
* 1,750 Mya extensive magmatism in Baltica, Sarmatia (Ukraine), southern Siberia, northern Laurentia, and West Africa indicate these cratons were linked to each other;
* a 1,630–1,640 Mya-old continent composed of Siberia, Laurentia, and Baltica is suggested by sills in southern Siberia that can be connected to the Melville Bugt dyke swarm in western Greenland;
* a major large igneous province 1,380 Mya during the breakup of the Nuna supercontinent connects Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia, Congo, West Africa.

===Rodinia===
In the vast majority of plate tectonic reconstructions, Laurentia formed the core of the supercontinent Rodinia, but the exact fit of various continents within Rodinia is debated. In some reconstructions, Baltica was attached to Greenland along its Scandinavian margin while Amazonia was docked along Baltica&#x27;s Tornquist margin. Australia and East Antarctica were located on Laurentia&#x27;s western margin.

Siberia was located near but at some distance from Laurentia&#x27;s northern margin in most reconstructions. In the reconstruction of some Russian geologists, however, the southern margin (modern coordinates) of Siberia merged with the northern margin of Laurentia, and these two continents broke up along what is now the -long Central Asian Foldbelt no later than 570 Mya and traces of this breakup can still be found in the Franklin dike swarm in northern Canada and the Aldan Shield in Siberia.

The Proto-Pacific opened and Rodinia began to breakup during the Neoproterozoic (c. 750–600 Mya) as Australia-Antarctica (East Gondwana) rifted from the western margin of Laurentia, while the rest of Rodinia (West Gondwana and Laurasia) rotated clockwise and drifted south. Earth subsequently underwent a series of glaciations – the Varanger (c. 650 Mya, also known as Snowball Earth) and the Rapitan and Ice Brook glaciations (c. 610-590 Mya) – both Laurentia and Baltica were located south of 30°S, with the South Pole located in eastern Baltica, and glacial deposits from this period have been found in Laurentia and Baltica but not in Siberia.

A mantle plume (the Central Iapetus Magmatic Province) forced Laurentia and Baltica to separate ca. 650–600 Mya and the Iapetus Ocean opened between them. Laurentia then began to move quickly () north towards the Equator where it got stuck over a cold spot in the Proto-Pacific. Baltica remained near Gondwana in southern latitudes into the Ordovician.

===Pannotia===
Laurentia, Baltica, and Siberia remained connected to each other within the short-lived, Precambrian-Cambrian supercontinent Pannotia or Greater Gondwana. At this time a series of continental blocks  called as Peri-Gondwana,  that now form parts of Asia, the Cathaysian terranes,  namely Indochina, North China, South China , Cimmerian terranes,  Sibumasu, Qiangtang, Lhasa, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey – were still attached to the Indian–Australian margin of Gondwana. Other blocks that now form part of southwestern Europe and North America from New England to Florida were still attached to the African-South American margin of Gondwana. This northward drift of terranes across the Tethys Ocean also included the Hunic terranes, now spread from Europe to China.

Pannotia broke apart in the late Precambrian into Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia, Gondwana. A series of continental blocks,  the Cadomian, Avalonian, Cathaysian, Cimmerian terranes,  broke away from Gondwana and began to drift north.

== Euramerica/Laurussia ==

Laurentia remained almost static near the Equator throughout the early Palaeozoic, separated from Baltica by the up to -wide Iapetus Ocean. In the Late Cambrian, the mid-ocean ridge in the Iapetus Ocean subducted beneath Gondwana which resulted in the opening of a series of large back-arc basins. During the Ordovician, these basins evolved into a new ocean, the Rheic Ocean, which separated a series of terranes – Avalonia, Carolinia, and Armorica – from Gondwana.

Avalonia rifted from Gondwana in the Early Ordovician and collided with Baltica near the Ordovician–Silurian boundary (480–420 Mya). Baltica-Avalonia was then rotated and pushed north towards Laurentia. The collision between these continents closed the Iapetus Ocean and formed Laurussia, also known as Euramerica. Another historical term for this continent is the Old Red Continent or Old Red Sandstone Continent, in reference to abundant red beds of the Old Red Sandstone during the Devonian. The continent covered including several large Arctic continental blocks.

With the Caledonian orogeny completed Laurussia was delimited thus:
* The eastern margin were the Barents Shelf and Moscow Platform;
* the western margin were the western shelves of Laurentia, later affected by the Antler orogeny;
* the northern margin was the Innuitian-Lomonosov orogeny which marked the collision between Laurussia and the Arctic Craton;
* the southern margin was a Pacific-style active margin where the northward directed subduction of the ocean floor between Gondwana and Laurussia pushed continental fragments towards the latter.

During the Devonian (416-359 Mya) the combined landmass of Baltica and Avalonia rotated around Laurentia, which remained static near the Equator. The Laurentian warm, shallow seas and on shelves a diverse assemblage of benthos evolved, including the largest trilobites exceeding . The Old Red Sandstone Continent stretched across northern Laurentia and into Avalonia and Baltica but for most of the Devonian a narrow seaway formed a barrier where the North Atlantic would later open. Tetrapods evolved from fish in the Late Devonian, with the oldest known fossils from Greenland. Low sea-levels during the Early Devonian produced natural barriers in Laurussia which resulted in provincialism within the benthic fauna. In Laurentia the Transcontinental Arch divided brachiopods into two provinces, with one of them confined to a large embayment west of the Appalachians. By the Middle Devonian, these two provinces had been united into one and the closure of the Rheic Ocean finally united faunas across Laurussia. High plankton productivity from the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary resulted in anoxic events that left black shales in the basins of Laurentia.

===Pangaea===
The subduction of the Iapetus Ocean resulted in the first contact between Laurussia and Gondwana in the Late Devonian and terminated in full collision or the Variscan orogeny in the early Carboniferous (340 Mya). The Variscan orogeny closed the Rheic Ocean (between Avalonia and Armorica) and the Proto-Tethys Ocean (between Armorica and Gondwana) to form the supercontinent Pangaea. The Variscan orogeny is complex and the exact timing and the order of the collisions between involved microcontinents has been debated for decades.

Pangaea was completely assembled by the Permian except for the Asian blocks. The supercontinent was centred on the Equator during the Triassic and Jurassic, a period that saw the emergence of the Pangaean megamonsoon. Heavy rainfall resulted in high groundwater tables, in turn resulting in peat formation and extensive coal deposits.

During the Cambrian and Early Ordovician, when wide oceans separated all major continents, only pelagic marine organisms, such as plankton, could move freely across the open ocean and therefore the oceanic gaps between continents are easily detected in the fossil records of marine bottom dwellers and non-marine species. By the Late Ordovician, when continents were pushed closer together closing the oceanic gaps, benthos (brachiopods and trilobites) could spread between continents while ostracods and fishes remained isolated. As Laurussia formed during the Devonian and Pangaea formed, fish species in both Laurussia and Gondwana began to migrate between continents and before the end of the Devonian similar species were found on both sides of what remained of the Variscan barrier.

The oldest tree fossils are from the Middle Devonian pteridophyte Gilboa Fossil Forest in central Laurussia (today New York City, United States). In the late Carboniferous, Laurussia was centred on the Equator and covered by tropical rainforests, commonly referred to as the coal forests. By the Permian, the climate had become arid and these Carboniferous rainforests collapsed, lycopsids (giant mosses) were replaced by treeferns. In the dry climate a detritivorous fauna – including ringed worms, molluscs, and some arthropods – evolved and diversified, alongside other arthropods who were herbivorous and carnivorous, and tetrapods – insectivores and piscivores such as amphibians and early amniotes.

==Laurasia==

During the Carboniferous to Permian periods, Siberia, Kazakhstania, Baltica collided in the Uralian orogeny to form Laurasia.

The Palaezoic-Mesozoic transition was marked by the reorganisation of Earth&#x27;s tectonic plates which resulted in the assembly of Pangaea, and eventually its break-up. Caused by the detachment of subducted mantle slabs, this reorganisation resulted in rising mantle plumes that produced large igneous provinces when they reached the crust. This tectonic activity also resulted in the Permian–Triassic extinction event. Tentional stresses across Eurasia developed into a large system of rift basins (Urengoy, East Uralian-Turgay, Khudosey) and flood basalts in the West Siberian Basin, the Pechora Basin, South China.

Laurasia and Gondwana were equal in size but had distinct geological histories. Gondwana was assembled before the formation of Pangaea, but the assembly of Laurasia occurred during and after the formation of the supercontinent. These differences resulted in different patterns of basin formation and transport of sediments. East Antarctica was the highest ground within Pangaea and produced sediments that were transported across eastern Gondwana but never reached Laurasia. During the Palaeozoic, c. 30–40% of Laurasia was covered by shallow marine water but only 10–20% of Gondwana was covered by shallow marine water.

===Asian blocks===

During the assembly of Pangaea, Laurasia grew as continental blocks broke off Gondwana&#x27;s northern margin; pulled by old closing oceans in front of them and pushed by new opening oceans behind them. During the Neoproterozoic-Early Paleozoic break-up of Rodinia, the opening of the Proto-Tethys Ocean split the Asian blocks – Tarim, Qaidam, Alex, North China, South China – from the northern shores of Gondwana (north of India and Australia in modern coordinates) and the closure of the same ocean reassembled them along the same shores 500–460 Mya resulting in Gondwana at its largest extent.

The break-up of Rodinia also resulted in the opening of the long-lived Paleo-Asian Ocean between Baltica and Siberia in the north and Tarim and North China in the south. The closure of this ocean is preserved in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt, the largest orogen on Earth.

North China, South China, Indochina, Tarim broke off from Gondwana during the Silurian to Devonian periods; as the Paleo-Tethys Ocean opened behind them. Sibumasu and Qiantang and other Cimmerian continental fragments broke off in the Early Permian. Lhasa, Burma, Sikuleh, southwest Sumatra, West Sulawesi, and parts of Borneo, broke off during the Late Triassic-Late Jurassic.

During the Carboniferous and Permian, Baltica first collided with Kazakhstania and Siberia, then North China with Mongolia and Siberia. By the middle Carboniferous, however, South China had already been in contact with North China long enough to allow floral exchange between the two continents. The Cimmerian blocks rifted from Gondwana in the Late Carboniferous.

In the early Permian, the Neo-Tethys Ocean opened behind the Cimmerian terranes (Sibumasu, Qiantang, Lhasa) and, in the late Carboniferous, the Paleo-Tethys Ocean closed in front. The eastern branch of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, however, remained opened while Siberia was added to Laurussia and Gondwana collided with Laurasia.

When the eastern Palaeo-Tethys closed 250–230 Mya, a series of Asian blocks – Sibumasu, Indochina, South China, Qiantang, Lhasa – formed a separate southern Asian continent. This continent collided 240–220 Mya with a northern continent – North China, Qinling, Qilian, Qaidam, Alex, Tarim – along the Central China orogen to form a combined East Asian continent. The northern margins of the northern continent collided with Baltica and Siberia 310–250 Ma, and thus the formation of the East Asian continent marked Pangaea at its greatest extent. By this time, the rifting of western Pangaea had already begun.

===Flora and fauna===
Pangaea split in two as the Tethys Seaway opened between Gondwana and Laurasia in the Late Jurassic. The fossil record, however, suggests the intermittent presence of a Trans-Tethys land bridge, though the location and duration of such a land bridge remains enigmatic.

Pine trees evolved in the early Mesozoic c. 250 Mya and the pine genus originated in Laurasia in the Early Cretaceous c. 130 Mya in competition with faster growing flowering plants. Pines adapted to cold and arid climates in environments where the growing season was shorter or wildfire common; this evolution limited pine range to between 31° and 50° north and resulted in a split into two subgenera: &quot;Strobus&quot; adapted to stressful environments and &quot;Pinus&quot; to fire-prone landscapes. By the end of the Cretaceous, pines were established across Laurasia, from North America to East Asia.

From the Triassic to the Early Jurassic, before the break-up of Pangaea, archosaurs (crurotarsans, pterosaurs and dinosaurs including birds) had a global distribution, especially crurotarsans, the group ancestral to the crocodilians. This cosmopolitanism ended as Gondwana fragmented and Laurasia was assembled. Pterosaur diversity reach a maximum in the Late Jurassic—Early Cretaceous and plate tectonic didn&#x27;t affect the distribution of these flying reptiles. Crocodilian ancestors also diversified during the Early Cretaceous but were divided into Laurasian and Gondwanan populations; true crocodilians evolved from the former. The distribution of the three major groups of dinosaurs – the sauropods, theropods, and ornithischians – was similar to that of the crocodilians. East Asia remained isolated with endemic species including psittacosaurs (horned dinosaurs) and Ankylosauridae (club-tailed, armoured dinosaurs).

Meanwhile, mammals slowly settled in Laurasia from Gondwana in the Triassic, the latter of which was the living area of their Permian ancestors. They split in two groups, with one returning to Gondwana (and stayed there after Pangaea split) while the other staying in Laurasia (until further descendants switched to Gondwana starting from the Jurassic).

In the early Eocene, a peak in global warming led to a pan-Arctic fauna with alligators and amphibians present north of the Arctic Circle. In the early Paleogene, landbridges still connected continents, allowing land animals to migrate between them. On the other hand, submerged areas occasionally divided continents: the Turgai Strait separated Europe and Asia from the Middle Jurassic to the Oligocene and as this strait dried out, a massive faunal interchange took place and the resulting extinction event in Europe is known as the &quot;Grande Coupure&quot;.

The Coraciiformes (an order of birds including kingfishers) evolved in Laurasia. While this group now has a mostly tropical distribution, they originated in the Arctic in the late Eocene c. 35 Mya from where they diversified across Laurasia and farther south across the Equator.

The placental mammal group of Laurasiatheria is named after Laurasia.

===Final split===
In the Triassic–Early Jurassic (c. 200 Mya), the opening of the Central Atlantic Ocean was preceded by the formation of a series of large rift basins, such as the Newark Basin, between eastern North America, from what is today the Gulf of Mexico to Nova Scotia, and in Africa and Europe, from Morocco to Greenland.

By c. 83 Mya spreading had begun in the North Atlantic between the Rockall Basin, a continental fragment sitting on top of the Eurasian Plate, and North America. By 56 Mya, Greenland had become an independent plate, separated from North America by the Labrador Sea-Baffin Bay Rift. By 33 Mya, spreading had ceased in the Labrador Sea and relocated to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The opening of the North Atlantic Ocean had effectively broken Laurasia in two.

<doc id="145704" wikidata="Q82122" url="?curid=145704" title="Jean-Baptiste Lamarck">
<text>Jean-Baptiste Pierre Antoine de Monet, chevalier de Lamarck (1 August 1744 – 18 December 1829), often known simply as Lamarck (; ), was a French naturalist, biologist, academic, and soldier. He was an early proponent of the idea that biological evolution occurred and proceeded in accordance with natural laws.

Lamarck fought in the Seven Years&#x27; War against Prussia, and was awarded a commission for bravery on the battlefield. Posted to Monaco, Lamarck became interested in natural history and resolved to study medicine. He retired from the army after being injured in 1766, and returned to his medical studies. Lamarck developed a particular interest in botany, and later, after he published the three-volume work &quot;Flore françoise&quot; (1778), he gained membership of the French Academy of Sciences in 1779. Lamarck became involved in the Jardin des Plantes and was appointed to the Chair of Botany in 1788. When the French National Assembly founded the Muséum national d&#x27;Histoire naturelle in 1793, Lamarck became a professor of zoology.

In 1801, he published &quot;Système des animaux sans vertèbres&quot;, a major work on the classification of invertebrates, a term which he coined. In an 1802 publication, he became one of the first to use the term &quot;biology&quot; in its modern sense. Lamarck continued his work as a premier authority on invertebrate zoology. He is remembered, at least in malacology, as a taxonomist of considerable stature.

The modern era generally remembers Lamarck for a theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics, called Lamarckism (inaccurately named after him), soft inheritance, or use/disuse theory, which he described in his 1809 &quot;Philosophie zoologique&quot;. However, the idea of soft inheritance long antedates him, formed only a small element of his theory of evolution, and was in his time accepted by many natural historians. Lamarck&#x27;s contribution to evolutionary theory consisted of the first truly cohesive theory of biological evolution, in which an alchemical complexifying force drove organisms up a ladder of complexity, and a second environmental force adapted them to local environments through &quot;use and disuse&quot; of characteristics, differentiating them from other organisms. Scientists have debated whether advances in the field of transgenerational epigenetics mean that Lamarck was to an extent correct, or not.

==Biography==
Jean-Baptiste Lamarck was born in Bazentin, Picardy, northern France, as the 11th child in an impoverished aristocratic family. Male members of the Lamarck family had traditionally served in the French army. Lamarck&#x27;s eldest brother was killed in combat at the Siege of Bergen op Zoom, and two other brothers were still in service when Lamarck was in his teenaged years. Yielding to the wishes of his father, Lamarck enrolled in a Jesuit college in Amiens in the late 1750s.

After his father died in 1760, Lamarck bought himself a horse, and rode across the country to join the French army, which was in Germany at the time. Lamarck showed great physical courage on the battlefield in the Seven Years&#x27; War with Prussia, and he was even nominated for the lieutenancy. Lamarck&#x27;s company was left exposed to the direct artillery fire of their enemies, and was quickly reduced to just 14 men—with no officers. One of the men suggested that the puny, 17-year-old volunteer should assume command and order a withdrawal from the field; although Lamarck accepted command, he insisted they remain where they had been posted until relieved.

When their colonel reached the remains of their company, this display of courage and loyalty impressed him so much that Lamarck was promoted to officer on the spot. However, when one of his comrades playfully lifted him by the head, he sustained an inflammation in the lymphatic glands of the neck, and he was sent to Paris to receive treatment. He was awarded a commission and settled at his post in Monaco. There, he encountered &quot;Traité des plantes usuelles&quot;, a botany book by James Francis Chomel.

With a reduced pension of only 400 francs a year, Lamarck resolved to pursue a profession. He attempted to study medicine, and supported himself by working in a bank office. Lamarck studied medicine for four years, but gave it up under his elder brother&#x27;s persuasion. He was interested in botany, especially after his visits to the Jardin du Roi, and he became a student under Bernard de Jussieu, a notable French naturalist. Under Jussieu, Lamarck spent 10 years studying French flora. In 1776, he wrote his first scientific essay—a chemical treatise.

After his studies, in 1778, he published some of his observations and results in a three-volume work, entitled &quot;Flore française&quot;. Lamarck&#x27;s work was respected by many scholars, and it launched him into prominence in French science. On 8 August 1778, Lamarck married Marie Anne Rosalie Delaporte. Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, one of the top French scientists of the day, mentored Lamarck, and helped him gain membership to the French Academy of Sciences in 1779 and a commission as a royal botanist in 1781, in which he traveled to foreign botanical gardens and museums. Lamarck&#x27;s first son, André, was born on 22 April 1781, and he made his colleague André Thouin the child&#x27;s godfather.

In his two years of travel, Lamarck collected rare plants that were not available in the Royal Garden, and also other objects of natural history, such as minerals and ores, that were not found in French museums. On 7 January 1786, his second son, Antoine, was born, and Lamarck chose Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, Bernard de Jussieu&#x27;s nephew, as the boy&#x27;s godfather. On 21 April the following year, Charles René, Lamarck&#x27;s third son, was born. René Louiche Desfontaines, a professor of botany at the Royal Garden, was the boy&#x27;s godfather, and Lamarck&#x27;s elder sister, Marie Charlotte Pelagie De Monet, was the godmother. In 1788, Buffon&#x27;s successor at the position of Intendant of the Royal Garden, Charles-Claude Flahaut de la Billaderie, comte d&#x27;Angiviller, created a position for Lamarck, with a yearly salary of 1,000 francs, as the keeper of the herbarium of the Royal Garden.

In 1790, at the height of the French Revolution, Lamarck changed the name of the Royal Garden from Jardin du Roi to Jardin des Plantes, a name that did not imply such a close association with King Louis XVI. Lamarck had worked as the keeper of the herbarium for five years before he was appointed curator and professor of invertebrate zoology at the Muséum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle in 1793. During his time at the herbarium, Lamarck&#x27;s wife gave birth to three more children before dying on 27 September 1792. With the official title of &quot;Professeur d&#x27;Histoire naturelle des Insectes et des Vers&quot;, Lamarck received a salary of nearly 2,500 francs per year. The following year, on 9 October, he married Charlotte Reverdy, who was 30 years his junior. On 26 September 1794 Lamarck was appointed to serve as secretary of the assembly of professors for the museum for a period of one year. In 1797, Charlotte died, and he married Julie Mallet the following year; she died in 1819.

In his first six years as professor, Lamarck published only one paper, in 1798, on the influence of the moon on the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Lamarck began as an essentialist who believed species were unchanging; however, after working on the molluscs of the Paris Basin, he grew convinced that transmutation or change in the nature of a species occurred over time. He set out to develop an explanation, and on 11 May 1800 (the 21st day of &quot;Floreal&quot;, Year VIII, in the revolutionary timescale used in France at the time), he presented a lecture at the Muséum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle in which he first outlined his newly developing ideas about evolution.

In 1801, he published &quot;Système des Animaux sans Vertèbres&quot;, a major work on the classification of invertebrates. In the work, he introduced definitions of natural groups among invertebrates. He categorized echinoderms, arachnids, crustaceans, and annelids, which he separated from the old taxon for worms known as &quot;Vermes&quot;. Lamarck was the first to separate arachnids from insects in classification, and he moved crustaceans into a separate class from insects.

In 1802, Lamarck published &quot;Hydrogéologie&quot;, and became one of the first to use the term biology in its modern sense. In &quot;Hydrogéologie&quot;, Lamarck advocated a steady-state geology based on a strict uniformitarianism. He argued that global currents tended to flow from east to west, and continents eroded on their eastern borders, with the material carried across to be deposited on the western borders. Thus, the Earth&#x27;s continents marched steadily westward around the globe.

That year, he also published &quot;Recherches sur l&#x27;Organisation des Corps Vivants&quot;, in which he drew out his theory on evolution. He believed that all life was organized in a vertical chain, with gradation between the lowest forms and the highest forms of life, thus demonstrating a path to progressive developments in nature.

In his own work, Lamarck had favored the then-more traditional theory based on the classical four elements. During Lamarck&#x27;s lifetime, he became controversial, attacking the more enlightened chemistry proposed by Lavoisier. He also came into conflict with the widely respected palaeontologist Georges Cuvier, who was not a supporter of evolution. According to Peter J. Bowler, Cuvier &quot;ridiculed Lamarck&#x27;s theory of transformation and defended the fixity of species.&quot; According to Martin J. S. Rudwick:

Lamarck gradually turned blind; he died in Paris on 18 December 1829. When he died, his family was so poor, they had to apply to the Academie for financial assistance. Lamarck was buried in a common grave of the Montparnasse cemetery for just five years, according to the grant obtained from relatives. Later, the body was dug up along with other remains and was lost. Lamarck&#x27;s books and the contents of his home were sold at auction, and his body was buried in a temporary lime pit.
After his death, Cuvier used the form of a eulogy to denigrate Lamarck:
==Lamarckian evolution==
While he was working on &quot;Hydrogéologie&quot; (1802), Lamarck had the idea to apply the principle of erosion to biology. This led him to the basic principle of evolution, which saw the fluids in organs inheriting more complex forms and functions, thus passing on these traits to the organism&#x27;s descendants. This was a reversal from Lamarck&#x27;s previous view, published in his &quot;Memoirs of Physics and Natural History&quot; (1797), in which he briefly refers to the immutability of species.

Lamarck stressed two main themes in his biological work (neither of them to do with soft inheritance). The first was that the environment gives rise to changes in animals. He cited examples of blindness in moles, the presence of teeth in mammals and the absence of teeth in birds as evidence of this principle. The second principle was that life was structured in an orderly manner and that many different parts of all bodies make possible the organic movements of animals.

Although he was not the first thinker to advocate organic evolution, he was the first to develop a truly coherent evolutionary theory. He outlined his theories regarding evolution first in his &quot;Floreal&quot; lecture of 1800, and then in three later published works:

* &quot;Recherches sur l&#x27;organisation des corps vivants&quot;, 1802.
* &quot;Philosophie zoologique&quot;, 1809.
* &quot;Histoire naturelle des animaux sans vertèbres&quot;, (in seven volumes, 1815–22).

Lamarck employed several mechanisms as drivers of evolution, drawn from the common knowledge of his day and from his own belief in the chemistry before Lavoisier. He used these mechanisms to explain the two forces he saw as constituting evolution: force driving animals from simple to complex forms and a force adapting animals to their local environments and differentiating them from each other. He believed that these forces must be explained as a necessary consequence of basic physical principles, favoring a materialistic attitude toward biology.

===&quot;Le pouvoir de la vie&quot;: The complexifying force===

Lamarck referred to a tendency for organisms to become more complex, moving &quot;up&quot; a ladder of progress. He referred to this phenomenon as &quot;Le pouvoir de la vie&quot; or &quot;la force qui tend sans cesse à composer l&#x27;organisation&quot; (The force that perpetually tends to make order). Lamarck believed in the ongoing spontaneous generation of simple living organisms through action on physical matter by a material life force.

Lamarck ran against the modern chemistry promoted by Lavoisier (whose ideas he regarded with disdain), preferring to embrace a more traditional alchemical view of the elements as influenced primarily by earth, air, fire, and water. He asserted that once living organisms form, the movements of fluids in living organisms naturally drove them to evolve toward ever greater levels of complexity:

He argued that organisms thus moved from simple to complex in a steady, predictable way based on the fundamental physical principles of alchemy. In this view, simple organisms never disappeared because they were constantly being created by spontaneous generation in what has been described as a &quot;steady-state biology&quot;. Lamarck saw spontaneous generation as being ongoing, with the simple organisms thus created being transmuted over time becoming more complex. He is sometimes regarded as believing in a teleological (goal-oriented) process where organisms became more perfect as they evolved, though as a materialist, he emphasized that these forces must originate necessarily from underlying physical principles. According to the paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn, &quot;Lamarck denied, absolutely, the existence of any &#x27;perfecting tendency&#x27; in nature, and regarded evolution as the final necessary effect of surrounding conditions on life.&quot; Charles Coulston Gillispie, a historian of science, has written &quot;life is a purely physical phenomenon in Lamarck&quot;, and argued that Lamarck&#x27;s views should not be confused with the vitalist school of thought.

===&quot;L&#x27;influence des circonstances&quot;: The Adaptive Force===
The second component of Lamarck&#x27;s theory of evolution was the adaptation of organisms to their environment. This could move organisms upward from the ladder of progress into new and distinct forms with local adaptations. It could also drive organisms into evolutionary blind alleys, where the organism became so finely adapted that no further change could occur. Lamarck argued that this adaptive force was powered by the interaction of organisms with their environment, by the use and disuse of certain characteristics.

====First law: use and disuse====
:First Law: In every animal which has not passed the limit of its development, a more frequent and continuous use of any organ gradually strengthens, develops and enlarges that organ, and gives it a power proportional to the length of time it has been so used; while the permanent disuse of any organ imperceptibly becomes weak and deteriorates it, and progressively diminishes its functional capacity or ability to function as expected, until it finally disappears.

====Second law: inheritance of acquired characteristics====
:Second Law: All the acquisitions or losses wrought by nature on individuals, through the influence of the environment in which their race has long been placed, and hence through the influence of the predominant use or permanent disuse of any organ; all these are preserved by reproduction to the new individuals which arise, provided that the acquired modifications are common to both sexes, or at least to the individuals which produce the young.

The last clause of this law introduces what is now called soft inheritance, the inheritance of acquired characteristics, or simply &quot;Lamarckism&quot;, though it forms only a part of Lamarck&#x27;s thinking. However, in the field of epigenetics, evidence is growing that soft inheritance plays a part in the changing of some organisms&#x27; phenotypes; it leaves the genetic material (DNA) unaltered (thus not violating the central dogma of biology) but prevents the expression of genes, such as by methylation to modify DNA transcription; this can be produced by changes in behaviour and environment. Many epigenetic changes are heritable to a degree. Thus, while DNA itself is not directly altered by the environment and behavior except through selection, the relationship of the genotype to the phenotype can be altered, even across generations, by experience within the lifetime of an individual. This has led to calls for biology to reconsider Lamarckian processes in evolution in light of modern advances in molecular biology.

==Religious views==

In his book &quot;Philosophie zoologique&quot;, Lamarck referred to God as the &quot;sublime author of nature&quot;. Lamarck&#x27;s religious views are examined in the book &quot;Lamarck, the Founder of Evolution&quot; (1901) by Alpheus Packard. According to Packard from Lamarck&#x27;s writings, he may be regarded as a deist.

The philosopher of biology Michael Ruse described Lamarck, &quot;as believing in God as an unmoved mover, creator of the world and its laws, who refuses to intervene miraculously in his creation.&quot; Biographer James Moore described Lamarck as a &quot;thoroughgoing deist&quot;.

The historian Jacques Roger has written, &quot;Lamarck was a materialist to the extent that he did not consider it necessary to have recourse to any spiritual principle... his deism remained vague, and his idea of creation did not prevent him from believing everything in nature, including the highest forms of life, was but the result of natural processes.&quot;

==Legacy==

Lamarck is known largely for his views on evolution, which have been dismissed in favour of developments in Darwinism. His theory of evolution only achieved fame after the publication of Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; (1859), which spurred critics of Darwin&#x27;s new theory to fall back on Lamarckian evolution as a more well-established alternative.

Lamarck is usually remembered for his belief in the then commonly held theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics, and the &quot;use and disuse&quot; model by which organisms developed their characteristics. Lamarck incorporated this belief into his theory of evolution, along with other common beliefs of the time, such as spontaneous generation. The inheritance of acquired characteristics (also called the theory of adaptation or soft inheritance) was rejected by August Weismann in the 1880s when he developed a theory of inheritance in which germ plasm (the sex cells, later redefined as DNA), remained separate and distinct from the soma (the rest of the body); thus, nothing which happens to the soma may be passed on with the germ plasm. This model allegedly underlies the modern understanding of inheritance.

Lamarck constructed one of the first theoretical frameworks of organic evolution. While this theory was generally rejected during his lifetime, Stephen Jay Gould argues that Lamarck was the &quot;primary evolutionary theorist&quot;, in that his ideas, and the way in which he structured his theory, set the tone for much of the subsequent thinking in evolutionary biology, through to the present day. Developments in epigenetics, the study of cellular and physiological traits that are heritable by daughter cells and not caused by changes in the DNA sequence, have caused debate about whether a &quot;neolamarckist&quot; view of inheritance could be correct: Lamarck was not in a position to give a molecular explanation for his theory. Eva Jablonka and Marion Lamb, for example, call themselves neolamarckists. Reviewing the evidence, David Haig argued that any such mechanisms must themselves have evolved through natural selection.

Darwin allowed a role for use and disuse as an evolutionary mechanism subsidiary to natural selection, most often in respect of &quot;disuse&quot;. He praised Lamarck for &quot;the eminent service of arousing attention to the probability of all change in the organic... world, being the result of law, not miraculous interposition&quot;. &quot;Lamarckism&quot; is also occasionally used to describe quasi-evolutionary concepts in societal contexts, though not by Lamarck himself. For example, the memetic theory of cultural evolution is sometimes described as a form of Lamarckian inheritance of nongenetic traits.

===Species and other taxa named by Lamarck===

During his lifetime, Lamarck named a large number of species, many of which have become synonyms. The World Register of Marine Species gives no fewer than 1,634 records. The Indo-Pacific Molluscan Database gives 1,781 records. Among these are some well-known families such as the ark clams (Arcidae), the sea hares (Aplysiidae), and the cockles (Cardiidae). The International Plant Names Index gives 58 records, including a number of well-known genera such as the mosquito fern (&quot;Azolla&quot;).

===Species named in his honour===
The honeybee subspecies &quot;Apis mellifera lamarckii&quot; is named after Lamarck, as well as the bluefire jellyfish (&quot;Cyaneia lamarckii&quot;). A number of plants have also been named after him, including &quot;Amelanchier lamarckii&quot; (juneberry), &quot;Digitalis lamarckii&quot;, and &quot;Aconitum lamarckii&quot;, as well as the grass genus &quot;Lamarckia&quot;.

The International Plant Names Index gives 116 records of plant species named after Lamarck.

Among the marine species, no fewer than 103 species or genera carry the epithet &quot;&quot;lamarcki&quot;, &quot;lamarckii&quot; or &quot;lamarckiana&quot;&quot;, but many have since become synonyms. Marine species with valid names include:

<text>The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a mid-ocean ridge (a divergent or constructive plate boundary) located along the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, and part of the longest mountain range in the world. In the North Atlantic, the ridge separates the North American from the Eurasian plate and the African plate, north and south of the Azores triple junction. In the South Atlantic, it separates the African and South American plates. The ridge extends from a junction with the Gakkel Ridge (Mid-Arctic Ridge) northeast of Greenland southward to the Bouvet triple junction in the South Atlantic. Although the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is mostly an underwater feature, portions of it have enough elevation to extend above sea level, for example in Iceland. The ridge has an average spreading rate of about per year.

==Discovery==

A ridge under the northern Atlantic Ocean was first inferred by Matthew Fontaine Maury in 1853, based on soundings by the USS &quot;Dolphin&quot;. The existence of the ridge and its extension into the South Atlantic was confirmed during the expedition of HMS &quot;Challenger&quot; in 1872. A team of scientists on board, led by Charles Wyville Thomson, discovered a large rise in the middle of the Atlantic while investigating the future location for a transatlantic telegraph cable. The existence of such a ridge was confirmed by sonar in 1925 and was found to extend around Cape Agulhas into the Indian Ocean by the German Meteor expedition.

In the 1950s, mapping of the Earth&#x27;s ocean floors by Marie Tharp, Bruce Heezen, Maurice Ewing, and others revealed that the Mid-Atlantic Ridge had a strange bathymetry of valleys and ridges, with its central valley being seismologically active and the epicenter of many earthquakes. Ewing, Heezen and Tharp discovered that the ridge is part of a 40,000-km (25,000 mile) long essentially continuous system of mid-ocean ridges on the floors of all the Earth&#x27;s oceans. The discovery of this worldwide ridge system led to the theory of seafloor spreading and general acceptance of Alfred Wegener&#x27;s theory of continental drift and expansion in the modified form of plate tectonics. The ridge is a feature whose contribution to the breakup of the supercontinent of Pangaea, in the period from about 200 to 160 million years ago, is considered in the modelling of such breakup in modern tectonic theory, where subduction and mantel plumes mechanisms are hypothesised to be primary, although historically this was contentious.

==Notable features==

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge includes a deep rift valley that runs along the axis of the ridge for nearly its entire length. This rift marks the actual boundary between adjacent tectonic plates, where magma from the mantle reaches the seafloor, erupting as lava and producing new crustal material for the plates.

Near the equator, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is divided into the North Atlantic Ridge and the South Atlantic Ridge by the Romanche Trench, a narrow submarine trench with a maximum depth of , one of the deepest locations of the Atlantic Ocean. This trench, however, is not regarded as the boundary between the North and South American plates, nor the Eurasian and African plates.

==Islands==

The islands on or near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, from north to south, with their respective highest peaks and location, are:

Northern Hemisphere (North Atlantic Ridge):
#Jan Mayen (Beerenberg, 2277 metres (7470&#x27;) (at ), in the Arctic Ocean
#Iceland (Hvannadalshnúkur at Vatnajökull, 2109.6 metres (6921&#x27;) (at ), through which the ridge runs
#Azores (Ponta do Pico or Pico Alto, on Pico Island, 2351 metres (7713&#x27;), (at )
#Saint Peter and Paul Rocks (Southwest Rock, 22.5 metres (74&#x27;), at )
Southern Hemisphere (South Atlantic Ridge):
#Ascension Island (The Peak, Green Mountain, 859 metres (2818&#x27;), at )
#Saint Helena (Diana&#x27;s Peak, 818 metres (2684&#x27;) at )
#Tristan da Cunha (Queen Mary&#x27;s Peak, 2062 metres (6765&#x27;), at )
#Gough Island (Edinburgh Peak, 909 metres (2982&#x27;), at )
#Bouvet Island (Olavtoppen, 780 metres (2560&#x27;), at )

===Iceland===
The submarine section of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge close to southwest Iceland is known as the Reykjanes Ridge. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge runs through Iceland where the ridge is also known as the &quot;Neovolcanic Zone&quot;. In northern Iceland the Tjörnes fracture zone connects Iceland to the Kolbeinsey Ridge.

==Geology==

The ridge sits atop a geologic feature known as the Mid-Atlantic Rise, which is a progressive bulge that runs the length of the Atlantic Ocean, with the ridge resting on the highest point of this linear bulge. This bulge is thought to be caused by upward convective forces in the asthenosphere pushing the oceanic crust and lithosphere. This divergent boundary first formed in the Triassic period, when a series of three-armed grabens coalesced on the supercontinent Pangaea to form the ridge. Usually, only two arms of any given three-armed graben become part of a divergent plate boundary. The failed arms are called &quot;aulacogens&quot;, and the aulacogens of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge eventually became many of the large river valleys seen along the Americas and Africa (including the Mississippi River, Amazon River and Niger River). The Fundy Basin on the Atlantic coast of North America between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in Canada is evidence of the ancestral Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

<doc id="145707" wikidata="Q360823" url="?curid=145707" title="Bruce C. Heezen">
<text>Bruce Charles Heezen (; April 11, 1924 – June 21, 1977) was an American geologist. He worked with oceanographic cartographer Marie Tharp at Columbia University to map the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the 1950s.

==Biography==
Heezen was born in Vinton, Iowa. An only child, he moved at age six with his parents to Muscatine, Iowa, where he graduated from high school in 1942. He received his B.A. from the University of Iowa in 1947. He received his M.A. in 1952 and a Ph.D in 1957 from Columbia University.

Heezen collaborated extensively with cartographer Marie Tharp. He interpreted their joint work on the Mid-Atlantic ridge and the East Pacific Rise as supporting S. Warren Carey&#x27;s Expanding Earth Theory, developed in the 1950s, but under Tharp&#x27;s influence &quot;eventually gave up the idea of an expanding earth for a form of continental drift in the mid-1960s.&quot; Tharp was Heezen&#x27;s assistant while he was a graduate student and he gave her the task of drafting seafloor profiles. When she showed Heezen that her plotting of the North Atlantic revealed a rift valley, Heezen initially dismissed it as &quot;girl talk.&quot; Eventually they discovered that not only was there a North Atlantic rift valley, but a mountain range with a central valley that spanned the earth. They also realized that the oceanic earthquakes they had been separately plotting fell within the rift, a revolutionary theory at the time. He presented this mid-ocean rift and earthquake theory as his own work at Princeton in 1957. At that lecture, preeminent geologist Harry Hess told Heezen, &quot;Young man, you have shaken the foundations of geology!&quot;

Although Marie Tharp was later recognized and credited for her work on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, it was Heezen who, at the time in 1956, put out and received credit for the discovery that was made, leaving off Tharpe&#x27;s name.

Heezen died of a heart attack in 1977 while on a research cruise to study the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near Iceland aboard the NR-1 submarine.

==Honors and awards==
*1964: Henry Bryant Bigelow Medal in Oceanography awarded by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
*1973: Cullum Geographical Medal awarded by the American Geographical Society
*1977: Walter H. Bucher Medal awarded by the American Geophysical Union

The Oceanographic Survey Ship USNS &quot;Bruce C. Heezen&quot; was christened in honor of him in 1999.

Heezen Canyon is a large underwater canyon in the NW Atlantic, on the edge of the continental shelf.

Heezen Glacier in Antarctica was named after him in 1977.

<doc id="145708" wikidata="Q41139" url="?curid=145708" title="Melun">
<text>Melun () is a commune in the Seine-et-Marne department in the Île-de-France region, north-central France. It is located on the southeastern outskirts of Paris, about from the centre of the capital. Melun is the prefecture of Seine-et-Marne, and the seat of one of its &quot;arrondissements&quot;. Its inhabitants are called &quot;Melunais&quot;.

==History==
Meledunum began as a Gaulish town; Caesar noted Melun as &quot;a town of the Senones, situated on an island in the Seine&quot;; at the island there was a wooden bridge, which his men repaired. Roman Meledunum was a &quot;mutatio&quot; where fresh horses were kept available for official couriers on the Roman road south-southeast of Paris, where it forded the Seine. Around 500 A.D, Clovis I granted Melun to a Gallo-Roman magnate, Aurelianus, who had fought for Clovis several times and apparently influenced his conversion to Christianity.

The Normans sacked it in 845. The castle of Melun became a royal residence of the Capetian kings. Hugh Capet (See also: House of Capet) gave Melun to Bouchard, his favorite. In the reign of Hugh&#x27;s son, Robert II of France, Eudes, the count of Champagne, bought the city, but the king took it back for Bouchard in 999. The chatelain Gautier and his wife, who had sold the city, were hanged; Eudes escaped. Robert died there in July 1031.

Robert of Melun (c. 1100 – 27 February 1167) was an English scholastic Christian theologian who taught in France, and later became Bishop of Hereford in England. He studied under Peter Abelard in Paris before teaching there and at Melun, which gave him his surname.

In July 1415, Melun was besieged by King Henry V of England, who had recently signed the Treaty of Troyes with King Charles VI of France. The town was in the hands of the Dauphin, later Charles VII of France, who had been dispossessed by the treaty. The defenders were led by Arnaud Guillaume, seigneur de Barbazan, and fought off the besiegers for fourteen weeks before capitulating. The town was liberated by Joan of Arc on 17 April 1430.

===Counts of Melun===
*Aurelianus (c. 500)
*Donatus (?-834)
*Bouchard I (956/967–1005), also Count of Vendôme and Count of Paris

===Viscounts of Melun===
The early viscounts of Melun were listed by 17th and 18th century genealogists, notably Père Anselme. Based on closer reading of the original documents, Adolphe Duchalais constructed this list of viscounts in 1844:

*Salo (c. 993; possibly legendary)
*Joscelin I (c. 998)
*William (possibly c. 1000)
*Ursio (c. 1067–1085)
*William the Carpenter (c. 1094)
*Hilduin, Garin, Ursio II, Jean (unknown dates, possibly not viscounts)
*Adam (c. 1138–1141; married Mahaut, daughter of his predecessor)
*Joscelin II (c. 1156)

The title eventually became an honorary peerage. Such viscounts include Honoré Armand de Villars and Claude Louis Hector de Villars.

==Climate==
==Transport==

Melun is served by the Gare de Melun, which is an interchange station on Paris RER line D, on the Transilien R suburban rail line, and on several national rail lines.

==Main sights==

<text>Lester William Polsfuss (June 9, 1915 – August 12, 2009), known as Les Paul, was an American jazz, country, and blues guitarist, songwriter, luthier, and inventor. He was one of the pioneers of the solid-body electric guitar, and his prototype, called the Log, served as inspiration for the Gibson Les Paul. Paul taught himself how to play guitar, and while he is mainly known for jazz and popular music, he had an early career in country music. In the 1950s, he and his wife, singer and guitarist Mary Ford, recorded numerous records, selling millions of copies.

Paul is credited with many recording innovations. His early experiments with overdubbing (also known as sound on sound), delay effects such as tape delay, phasing, and multitrack recording were among the first to attract widespread attention. His licks, trills, chording sequences, fretting techniques, and timing set him apart from his contemporaries and inspired many guitarists of the present day.

Among his many honors, Paul is one of a handful of artists with a permanent exhibit in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He is prominently named by the music museum on its website as an &quot;architect&quot; and a &quot;key inductee&quot; with Sam Phillips and Alan Freed. Paul is the only inductee in both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Paul was born Lester William Polsfuss in Waukesha, Wisconsin, to George and Evelyn (Stutz) Polsfuss, both of German ancestry. Paul&#x27;s mother was related to the founders of Milwaukee&#x27;s Valentin Blatz Brewing Company and the makers of the Stutz automobile. His parents divorced when he was a child. His mother simplified their Prussian family name first to &quot;Polfuss&quot;, then to &quot;Polfus&quot;, although Les Paul never legally changed his name. Before taking the stage name &quot;Les Paul&quot;, he performed as &quot;Red Hot Red&quot; and &quot;Rhubarb Red&quot;.

At the age of eight, Paul began playing the harmonica. After learning the piano, he switched to the banjo and guitar. During this time, Paul invented a neck-worn harmonica holder, which allowed him to play both sides of the harmonica, hands-free, while performing on the banjo and guitar. Les Paul&#x27;s hands-free design is still widely manufactured today. By age thirteen, Paul was performing semi-professionally as a country-music singer, guitarist, and harmonica player. While playing at Waukesha area drive-ins and roadhouses, Paul began his first experiment with sound. Wanting to make his acoustic guitar heard by more people at the local venues, he wired a phonograph needle to his guitar and connected it to a radio speaker. As a teen Paul experimented with sustain by using a 2-foot piece of rail from a nearby train line. At age seventeen, Paul played with Rube Tronson&#x27;s Texas Cowboys, and soon after he dropped out of high school to team up with Sunny Joe Wolverton&#x27;s Radio Band in St. Louis, Missouri, on KMOX.

==Career==

===Early career===
Paul and Wolverton moved to Chicago in 1934, where they continued to perform country music on radio station WBBM and at the 1934 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair. While in Chicago, Paul learned jazz from the great performers on Chicago&#x27;s Southside. During the day, he played country music as Rhubarb Red on the radio. At night, he was Les Paul, playing jazz. He met pianist Art Tatum, whose playing influenced him to continue with the guitar rather than play jazz on the piano. His first two records were released in 1936, credited to &quot;Rhubarb Red&quot;, Paul&#x27;s hillbilly alter ego. He also served as an accompanist for other bands signed to Decca. During this time, he began adding different sounds and adopted his stage name of Les Paul.
Paul&#x27;s guitar style was strongly influenced by the music of Django Reinhardt, whom he greatly admired. Following World War II, Paul sought out and made friends with Reinhardt. When Reinhardt died in 1953, Paul paid for part of the funeral&#x27;s cost. One of Paul&#x27;s prized possessions was a Selmer acoustic guitar given to him by Reinhardt&#x27;s widow.

Paul formed a trio in 1937 with rhythm guitarist Jim Atkins (older half-brother of guitarist Chet Atkins) and bassist/percussionist Ernie &quot;Darius&quot; Newton. They left Chicago for New York in 1938, landing a featured spot with Fred Waring&#x27;s radio show. Chet Atkins later wrote that his brother, home on a family visit, presented him with an expensive Gibson archtop guitar that Les Paul had given to Jim. Chet recalled that it was the first professional-quality instrument he ever owned.

While jamming in his apartment basement in 1941, Paul nearly succumbed to electrocution. During two years of recuperation, he moved to Chicago where he was the music director for radio stations WJJD and WIND. In 1943, he moved to Hollywood where he performed on radio and formed a new trio.

He was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1943, where he served in the Armed Forces Radio Network, backing such artists as Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters, and performing in his own right.

As a last-minute replacement for Oscar Moore, Paul played with Nat King Cole and other artists in the inaugural Jazz at the Philharmonic concert in Los Angeles, California, on July 2, 1944. His solo on &quot;Body and Soul&quot; is a demonstration of his admiration for and emulation of Django Reinhardt, as well as his development of original lines.

Also that year, Paul&#x27;s trio appeared on Bing Crosby&#x27;s radio show. Crosby sponsored Paul&#x27;s recordings. They recorded together several times, including &quot;It&#x27;s Been a Long, Long Time&quot;, which was a No. 1 hit in 1945. Paul recorded several albums for Decca in the 1940s. The Andrews Sisters hired his trio to open for them during a tour in 1946. Their manager, Lou Levy, said watching Paul&#x27;s fingers while he played guitar was like watching a train go by. Their conductor, Vic Schoen, said his playing was always original. Maxine Andrews said, &quot;He&#x27;d tune into the passages we were singing and lightly play the melody, sometimes in harmony. We&#x27;d sing these fancy licks and he&#x27;d keep up with us note for note in exactly the same rhythm... almost contributing a fourth voice. But he never once took the attention away from what we were doing. He did everything he could to make us sound better.&quot; In the 1950s, when he recorded Mary Ford&#x27;s vocals on multiple tracks, he created music that sounded like the Andrews Sisters.

In January 1948, Paul shattered his right arm and elbow among multiple injuries in a near-fatal automobile accident on an icy Route 66 west of Davenport, Oklahoma. Mary Ford was driving the Buick convertible, which plunged off the side of a railroad overpass and dropped twenty feet into a ravine. They were returning from Wisconsin to Los Angeles after visiting family. Doctors at Oklahoma City&#x27;s Wesley Hospital told Paul that they could not rebuild his elbow. Their other option was amputation. Paul was flown to Los Angeles, where his arm was set at an angle—just over 90 degrees—that allowed him to cradle and pick the guitar. It took him nearly a year and a half to recover.

===Guitar builder===

In 1940, Les Paul revisited his experiments with the train rail. This time he created a similar prototype instrument, a one-off solid-body electric guitar known as &quot;The Log&quot;, which was manufactured utilizing a common construction material often referred to as a &quot;4×4 stud post&quot;, which provided a unique neck-thru design. The &quot;stud post&quot; (a 4″ × 4″ section of Douglas fir) was then equipped with a crude bridge and an electromagnetic pickup, neck and strings. The Log was constructed by Paul after-hours in the New York City Epiphone guitar factory, and is one of the first solid-body electric guitars. For the sake of appearance, he attached the body of an Epiphone hollow-body guitar sawn lengthwise with The Log in the middle. This solved his two main problems: feedback, as the acoustic body no longer resonated with the amplified sound, and sustain, as the energy of the strings was not dissipated in generating sound through the guitar body. These instruments were constantly being improved and modified over the years, and Paul continued to use them in his recordings even after the development of his eponymous Gibson model.

Paul approached the Gibson Guitar Corporation with his idea of a solid-body electric guitar in 1941, 
but Gibson showed no interest until Fender began marketing its Esquire and Broadcaster guitars in 1950 (the Broadcaster was renamed the Telecaster in 1952).

Gibson&#x27;s Ted McCarty was the chief designer of the guitar, which was based on Paul&#x27;s drawings and later dubbed the Gibson Les Paul. Gibson entered into a promotional and financial arrangement with Les Paul, paying him a royalty on sales. The guitar went on sale in 1952. Paul continued to make design suggestions.

In 1960, sales of the original Les Paul model had dropped, so a more modernistic model was introduced (today called the SG), but then still bearing the Les Paul name. Not liking the new look and severe problems with the strength of the body and neck, made Paul dissatisfied with this new Gibson guitar. This, and a pending divorce from Mary Ford, led to Paul ending his endorsement and use of his name on Gibson guitars from 1964 until 1966, by which time his divorce was completed.
Paul continued to suggest technical improvements, although they were not always successful commercially. In 1962, Paul was issued , for a pickup in which the coil was integrated into the bridge. In the mid-1940s, he introduced an aluminum guitar with the tuning mechanisms below the bridge. As it had no headstock, and the string attachments were at the nut, it was the first &quot;headless&quot; guitar. Unfortunately, Paul&#x27;s guitar was so sensitive to the heat from stage lights that it would not keep tune. However, he used it for several of his hit recordings. This style was further developed by others, most successfully Ned Steinberger.

A less-expensive version of the Les Paul guitar is manufactured for Gibson&#x27;s Epiphone brand.

===Multitrack recording===
Paul first experimented with sound on sound while in elementary school when he punched holes in the piano roll for his mother&#x27;s player piano. In 1946, his mother complimented him on a song she had heard on the radio, when in fact she had heard George Barnes, not Paul. This motivated Paul to spend two years in his Hollywood garage recording studio, creating his unique sound, his New Sound. Paul stunned the music industry with his New Sound in 1948.

Paul recorded several songs with Bing Crosby, most notably &quot;It&#x27;s Been a Long, Long Time,&quot; which was a number-one single in 1945.

After a recording session, Bing Crosby suggested that Paul build a recording studio so he could produce the sound he wanted. Paul started his studio in the garage of his home on North Curson Street in Hollywood. The studio drew many vocalists and musicians who wanted the benefit of his expertise. His experiments included microphone placement, track speed, and recording overdubs. These methods resulted in a clarity previously unheard in this type of multitrack recording. People began to consider his recording techniques as instruments—as important to production as a guitar, bass, or drums.

Capitol Records released &quot;Lover (When You&#x27;re Near Me)&quot;, on which Paul played eight different parts on electric guitar, some recorded at half-speed, hence &quot;double-fast&quot; when played back at normal speed for the master. This was the first time he used multitracking in a recording. His early multitrack recordings, including &quot;Lover&quot; and &quot;Brazil&quot;, were made with acetate discs. He recorded a track onto a disk, then recorded himself playing another part with the first. He built the multitrack recording with overlaid tracks rather than parallel ones as he did later. By the time he had a result that satisfied him, he had discarded some five hundred recording disks.

As a teen he had built a disc-cutter assembly using the flywheel from a Cadillac, a dental belt and other parts from his father&#x27;s car repair shop. Years later in his Hollywood garage, he used the acetate disc setup to record parts at different speeds and with delay, resulting in his signature sound with echoes and birdsong-like guitar riffs.

In 1949, Crosby gave Paul one of the first Ampex Model 200A reel to reel tape recorders. Paul invented sound on sound recording using this machine by placing an additional playback head, located before the conventional erase/record/playback heads. This allowed Paul to play along with a previously recorded track, both of which were mixed together onto a new track. The Ampex was a monophonic tape recorder with only one track across the entire width of quarter-inch tape, and therefore, the recording was &quot;destructive&quot; in the sense that the original recording was permanently replaced with the new, mixed recording. He eventually enhanced this by using one tape machine to play back the original recording and a second to record the combined track. This preserved the original recording.

In 1952, Paul invented the flange effect, wherein two recordings of the same sound run slightly asynchronously, causing phase cancellations that sweep through the frequency range. The first example of this can be heard on his song &quot;Mammy&#x27;s Boogie&quot;.

Observing film recordings inspired Paul to design the stacking of eight tape recorders. He worked with Ross Snyder on the design of the first eight-track recording deck built for him by Ampex for his home studio. Rein Narma built a custom 8-channel mixing console for him. The mixing board included in-line equalization and vibrato effects. He named the recorder &quot;The Octopus&quot; and the mixing console &quot;The Monster&quot;. The name &quot;octopus&quot; was inspired by comedian W. C. Fields, who was the first person to hear Paul play his multi-tracked guitar experiments. &quot;He came to my garage to make a little record (in 1946),&quot; Les recalled. &quot;I played him the acetate of &#x27;Lover&#x27; that I&#x27;d done. When he heard it, he said, &#x27;My boy, you sound like an octopus.

===Les Paul and Mary Ford===
In the summer of 1945, Paul met country-western singer Iris Colleen Summers. They began working together on Paul&#x27;s radio show, as Rhubarb Red and The Ozark Apple Knockers with Mary Lou. Later Paul suggested the stage name Mary Ford. They married in Milwaukee in 1949.

Their hits included &quot;How High the Moon&quot;, &quot;Bye Bye Blues&quot;, &quot;Song in Blue&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;cha Hear Them Bells&quot;, &quot;The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise&quot;, and &quot;Vaya con Dios&quot;. The songs were recorded with multiple tracks where Ford harmonized with herself and Paul played multiple layers of guitars.

They used the recording technique known as close miking where the microphone is less than from the singer&#x27;s mouth. This produces a more intimate, less reverberant sound than when a singer is or more from the microphone. When using a pressure-gradient (uni- or bi-directional) microphone, it emphasizes low-frequency sounds in the voice due to the microphone&#x27;s proximity effect and gives a more relaxed feel because the performer is not working as hard. The result is a singing style which diverged from the unamplified theater style of the musical comedies of the 1930s and 1940s.

They also performed music-hall style semi-comic routines with Mary mimicking whatever line Les decided to improvise.

===Radio and television programs===
Paul hosted a 15-minute radio program, &quot;The Les Paul Show&quot;, on NBC Radio in 1950, featuring his trio (himself, Ford and rhythm player Eddie Stapleton) and his electronics. The program was recorded from their home and with gentle humor between Paul and Ford bridging musical selections, some of which had already been successful on records, some of which anticipated the couple&#x27;s recordings, and many of which presented re-interpretations of such jazz and pop selections as &quot;In the Mood&quot;, &quot;Little Rock Getaway&quot;, &quot;Brazil&quot;, and &quot;Tiger Rag&quot;. Many of these shows survive and are available from various sources.

When Paul used magnetic tape, he could take his recording equipment on tour, making episodes for his fifteen-minute radio show in a hotel room.

The show appeared on television a few years later with the same format, but excluding the trio and retitled &quot;Les Paul &amp; Mary Ford at Home&quot; with &quot;Vaya Con Dios&quot; as the theme song. Sponsored by Warner–Lambert&#x27;s Listerine mouthwash, it was aired on NBC television during 1954–1955, and then was syndicated until 1960. The five-minute show, consisting of the performance of only one or two songs, aired five times a day, five days a week, and therefore was used as a brief interlude or fill-in for programming schedules. Since Paul created the entire show himself, including audio and video, he maintained the original recordings and was in the process of restoring them to current quality standards until his death.

During his radio shows, Paul introduced the fictional &quot;&quot; device, which multiplies anything fed into it, such as a guitar sound or a voice. It was Paul&#x27;s way of explaining how his single guitar could be multiplied to become a group of guitars. The device even became the subject of comedy, with Ford multiplying herself and her vacuum cleaner with it so she could finish the housework faster. Later, Paul created a real Les Paulverizer that he attached to his guitar. The invention allowed Paul to access pre-recorded layers of songs during live performances so he could replicate his recorded sound on stage.

===Later career===

In 1965, Paul went into semi-retirement, although he did return to his studio occasionally. He and Ford had divorced at the end of 1964 after she became tired of touring. One of Paul&#x27;s most recognizable recordings from then through the mid-1970s was an album for London Records/Phase 4 Stereo, &quot;Les Paul Now&quot; (1968), on which he updated some of his earlier hits. Paul played the initial guitar track, and George Barnes laid down the additional tracks while Paul engineered in his home studio. He also recorded two albums, &quot;Chester and Lester&quot; (1976) and &quot;Guitar Monsters&quot; (1978), for RCA Victor, comprising a meld of jazz and country improvisation with guitar virtuoso Chet Atkins, backed by some of Nashville&#x27;s celebrated studio musicians.

In 1969 Paul produced the album &quot;Poe Through the Glass Prism&quot; for RCA. The album featured songs based on Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s writing by the northeastern Pennsylvania band the Glass Prism. The album produced a single titled &quot;The Raven&quot; that appeared on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100.

As years progressed Paul played at slower tempos with a large pick that was easier to hold in his arthritic hand. In 2006, at the age of 90, he won two Grammy Awards at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards for his album &quot;Les Paul &amp; Friends: American Made World Played&quot;. He also performed every Monday night at Manhattan&#x27;s Iridium Jazz Club with guitarist Lou Pallo, bassist Paul Nowinski (and later, Nicki Parrott), and guitarist Frank Vignola and for a few years, pianist John Colianni. Paul, Pallo and Nowinski also performed at Fat Tuesdays.

Composer Richard Stein sued Paul for plagiarism, charging that Paul&#x27;s &quot;Johnny (is the Boy for Me)&quot; was taken from Stein&#x27;s 1937 song &quot;Sanie cu zurgălăi&quot; (Romanian for &quot;Sleigh with Bells&quot;). In 2000, a cover version of &quot;Johnny&quot; by Belgian musical group Vaya Con Dios that credited Paul prompted another action by the Romanian Musical Performing and Mechanical Rights Society.

== Artistry ==
Richard S. Ginell of AllMusic characterized Les Paul&#x27;s playing style with &quot;extremely rapid runs&quot;, &quot;bluesy&quot; string bends, &quot;fluttered and repeated&quot; single-note lead guitar lines, and chunking rhythm support&quot;. He was initially inspired by Django Reinhardt. Les Paul also incorporated elements of country into his guitar licks and &quot;humorous crowd-pleasing effects&quot;. Ginell also made note of Paul&#x27;s &quot;brassy&quot; playing style. Paul&#x27;s jazz influence was still apparent on his popular music hits of the 1940s and 1950s. He was unable to read music and relied on his aural skills to mentally compose tunes.

He is considered innovative in his field with pioneering achievements with developing the electric guitar, multi-track recording, solid-body guitar design, and electronic effects.

Jazz guitarists including George Benson, Al DiMeola, Stanley Jordan, Pat Martino, and Bucky Pizzarelli have cited Paul as an influence on their playing techniques and styles.

==Personal life==

Les Paul married Virginia Webb in 1937. They had two children, Les Paul Jr. (Rusty) (1941–2015), and Gene Paul (1944), who was named after actor-songwriter Gene Lockhart.

After getting divorced in 1949, Paul married Mary Ford (born Iris Colleen Summers). The best man and matron of honor were the parents of guitarist Steve Miller, whose family was from Milwaukee. Paul was Miller&#x27;s godfather and his first guitar teacher. Ford gave birth to their first child on November 30, 1954, but the girl was born prematurely and died when she was four days old. They adopted a girl, Colleen, in 1958, and their son, Robert (Bobby), was born the following year. Paul and Ford divorced in December 1964.

Paul and Ford maintained a house in Mahwah, New Jersey, and after their divorce Ford lived there until her death in 1977.

In 1995, Paul established the Les Paul Foundation, which was designed to remain dormant until his death. The Les Paul Foundation aims to inspire innovative and creative thinking by sharing the legacy of Les Paul through support of music education, recording, innovation, and medical research related to hearing. The Foundation established the Les Paul Innovation Award in 1991 and the Les Paul Spirit Award in 2016.

===Death===
On August 12, 2009, Paul died of complications from pneumonia at White Plains Hospital in White Plains, New York. After hearing about his death, many musicians commented on his importance. Slash called him &quot;vibrant and full of positive energy&quot;, while Richie Sambora called him a &quot;revolutionary in the music business&quot;. The Edge said, &quot;His legacy as a musician and inventor will live on and his influence on rock and roll will never be forgotten.&quot; On August 21, 2009, he was buried in Prairie Home Cemetery, Waukesha, Wisconsin.

==Awards and honors==

A few of Les Paul&#x27;s many awards are listed below. In 2007, he was given the National Medal of Arts from U.S. President George W. Bush.

Paul was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame (2005) for his development of the solid-body electric guitar. In 1988, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by guitarist Jeff Beck, who said, &quot;I&#x27;ve copied more licks from Les Paul than I&#x27;d like to admit.&quot; He was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame (2005), the Big Band &amp; Jazz Hall of Fame (1990), the New Jersey Inventors Hall of Fame (1996), and the New Jersey Hall of Fame (2010).

Two of his songs entered the Grammy Hall of Fame: &quot;How High the Moon&quot; and &quot;Vaya Con Dios&quot;. In 1976, he and Chet Atkins received the Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental. In 2005, he won Best Pop Instrumental for &quot;Caravan&quot; and Best Rock Instrumental for &quot;69 Freedom Special.&quot;

In 1983, Paul received a Grammy Trustees Award for lifetime achievement. In 2001, he was honored with the Special Merit/Technical Grammy Award, which recognizes &quot;individuals or institutions that have set the highest standards of excellence in the creative application of audio technology,&quot; a select award given to masters of audio innovation including Thomas Alva Edison, Leo Fender, and Beatles recording engineer Geoff Emerick. In 2004, he received an Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award in Engineering and a Lifetime Achievement in Music Education from the Wisconsin Foundation for School Music.

In 1960, he and Mary Ford received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

In 2009, Paul was named one of the top ten electric guitarists of all time by &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Two years later he was named the eighteenth greatest guitarist of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. During the same year, his name was added to the Nashville Walk of Fame.

In 2011, for Paul&#x27;s birthday on June 9–10, an interactive Google Doodle was shown on the Google homepage where the Google logo itself is formed as a Les Paul guitar and the user was able to play and record music. By the next 48 hours, approximately 40 million songs were recorded by users.

===Concerts and exhibitions===

In July 2005, a 90th-birthday tribute concert was held for Les Paul at Carnegie Hall in New York City. After performances by Steve Miller, Peter Frampton, Jose Feliciano, and a number of others, Paul was presented with a commemorative guitar from the Gibson Guitar Corporation. Three years later, at a tribute concert at the State Theater in Cleveland, Ohio, he received the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s American Music Masters Award. On June 9, 2015, a yearlong celebration of Paul&#x27;s 100th birthday kicked off in Times Square with performances by musicians including Steve Miller, Jose Feliciano, and Neal Schon, a memorabilia exhibition, and a proclamation from the Les Paul Foundation declaring June 9 as Les Paul Day.

In 2007, the biographical film &quot;Les Paul Chasing Sound&quot; was aired on the public television series American Masters. The premier showing was held at Milwaukee&#x27;s Downer Theater in conjunction with a concert Paul put on for the Waukesha County Historical Society &amp; Museum. The film contained interviews with Les Paul, performances by his trio on his 90th birthday, and interview commentary and performances by other musicians.

In June 2008, an exhibit showcasing Paul&#x27;s legacy and featuring items from his personal collection opened at Discovery World in Milwaukee. Paul played a concert in Milwaukee to coincide with the opening of the exhibit. Paul&#x27;s hometown of Waukesha, Wisconsin, opened a permanent exhibit titled &quot;The Les Paul Experience&quot; at the Waukesha County Museum in June 2013. The exhibit features artifacts on loan from the Les Paul Foundation. A self-guided tour of Les Paul&#x27;s Waukesha was created by the Les Paul Foundation.

A permanent Les Paul exhibit is also located at the Mahwah Historical Museum. Other museums that include Les Paul are the Museum of Making Music in Phoenix and the Grammy Museum in Newark, New Jersey.

In 2009, the concert film &quot;Les Paul Live in New York&quot; was aired on public television showing Les Paul performing on his 90th birthday at the Iridium Jazz Club in New York and in archival clips.

<text>A lithosphere () is the rigid, outermost rocky shell of a terrestrial planet or natural satellite. On Earth, it is composed of the crust and the lithospheric mantle, the topmost portion of the upper mantle that behaves elastically on time scales of up to thousands of years or more. The crust and upper mantle are distinguished on the basis of chemistry and mineralogy.

== Earth&#x27;s lithosphere ==
Earth&#x27;s lithosphere, which constitutes the hard and rigid outer vertical layer of the Earth, includes the crust and the lithospheric mantle (or mantle lithosphere), the uppermost part of the mantle that is not convecting. The lithosphere is underlain by the asthenosphere which is the weaker, hotter, and deeper part of the upper mantle that is able to convect. The lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary is defined by a difference in response to stress. The lithosphere remains rigid for very long periods of geologic time in which it deforms elastically and through brittle failure, while the asthenosphere deforms viscously and accommodates strain through plastic deformation.

The thickness of the lithosphere is thus considered to be the depth to the isotherm associated with the transition between brittle and viscous behavior. The temperature at which olivine becomes ductile (~) is often used to set this isotherm because olivine is generally the weakest mineral in the upper mantle.

The lithosphere is subdivided horizontally into tectonic plates, which often include terranes accreted from other plates.

=== History of the concept ===
The concept of the lithosphere as Earth&#x27;s strong outer layer was described by the English mathematician A. E. H. Love in his 1911 monograph &quot;Some problems of Geodynamics&quot; and further developed by the American geologist Joseph Barrell, who wrote a series of papers about the concept and introduced the term &quot;lithosphere&quot;. The concept was based on the presence of significant gravity anomalies over continental crust, from which he inferred that there must exist a strong, solid upper layer (which he called the lithosphere) above a weaker layer which could flow (which he called the asthenosphere). These ideas were expanded by the Canadian geologist Reginald Aldworth Daly in 1940 with his seminal work &quot;Strength and Structure of the Earth.&quot; They have been broadly accepted by geologists and geophysicists. These concepts of a strong lithosphere resting on a weak asthenosphere are essential to the theory of plate tectonics.

=== Types ===

The lithosphere can be divided into oceanic and continental lithosphere. Oceanic lithosphere is associated with oceanic crust (having a mean density of about ) and exists in the ocean basins. Continental lithosphere is associated with continental crust (having a mean density of about ) and underlies the continents and continental shelves.

==== Oceanic lithosphere ====
Oceanic lithosphere consists mainly of mafic crust and ultramafic mantle (peridotite) and is denser than continental lithosphere. Young oceanic lithosphere, found at mid-ocean ridges, is no thicker than the crust, but oceanic lithosphere thickens as it ages and moves away from the mid-ocean ridge. The oldest oceanic lithosphere is typically about thick. This thickening occurs by conductive cooling, which converts hot asthenosphere into lithospheric mantle and causes the oceanic lithosphere to become increasingly thick and dense with age. In fact, oceanic lithosphere is a thermal boundary layer for the convection in the mantle. The thickness of the mantle part of the oceanic lithosphere can be approximated as a thermal boundary layer that thickens as the square root of time.
formula_1

Here, formula_2 is the thickness of the oceanic mantle lithosphere, formula_3 is the thermal diffusivity (approximately ) for silicate rocks, and formula_4 is the age of the given part of the lithosphere. The age is often equal to L/V, where L is the distance from the spreading centre of mid-ocean ridge, and V is velocity of the lithospheric plate.

Oceanic lithosphere is less dense than asthenosphere for a few tens of millions of years but after this becomes increasingly denser than asthenosphere. While chemically differentiated oceanic crust is lighter than asthenosphere, thermal contraction of the mantle lithosphere makes it more dense than the asthenosphere. The gravitational instability of mature oceanic lithosphere has the effect that at subduction zones, oceanic lithosphere invariably sinks underneath the overriding lithosphere, which can be oceanic or continental. New oceanic lithosphere is constantly being produced at mid-ocean ridges and is recycled back to the mantle at subduction zones. As a result, oceanic lithosphere is much younger than continental lithosphere: the oldest oceanic lithosphere is about 170 million years old, while parts of the continental lithosphere are billions of years old.

===== Subducted lithosphere =====
Geophysical studies in the early 21st century posit that large pieces of the lithosphere have been subducted into the mantle as deep as to near the core-mantle boundary, while others &quot;float&quot; in the upper mantle. Yet others stick down into the mantle as far as but remain &quot;attached&quot; to the continental plate above, similar to the extent of the old concept of &quot;tectosphere&quot; revisited by Jordan in 1988. Subducting lithosphere remains rigid (as demonstrated by deep earthquakes along Wadati–Benioff zone) to a depth of about .

==== Continental lithosphere ====
Continental lithosphere has a range in thickness from about to perhaps ; the upper approximately of typical continental lithosphere is crust. The crust is distinguished from the upper mantle by the change in chemical composition that takes place at the Moho discontinuity. The oldest parts of continental lithosphere underlie cratons, and the mantle lithosphere there is thicker and less dense than typical; the relatively low density of such mantle &quot;roots of cratons&quot; helps to stabilize these regions.

Because of its relatively low density, continental lithosphere that arrives at a subduction zone cannot subduct much further than about before resurfacing. As a result, continental lithosphere is not recycled at subduction zones the way oceanic lithosphere is recycled. Instead, continental lithosphere is a nearly permanent feature of the Earth.

== Mantle xenoliths ==
Geoscientists can directly study the nature of the subcontinental mantle by examining mantle xenoliths brought up in kimberlite, lamproite, and other volcanic pipes. The histories of these xenoliths have been investigated by many methods, including analyses of abundances of isotopes of osmium and rhenium. Such studies have confirmed that mantle lithospheres below some cratons have persisted for periods in excess of 3 billion years, despite the mantle flow that accompanies plate tectonics.

== Microorganisms ==
The upper part of the lithosphere is a large habitat for microorganisms, with some found more than below Earth&#x27;s surface.

<text>The asthenosphere () is the mechanically weak and ductile region of the upper mantle of Earth. It lies below the lithosphere, at a depth between c. below the surface, and extends as deep as . However, the lower boundary of the asthenosphere is not well defined.

The asthenosphere is almost solid, but a slight amount of melting (less than 0.1% of the rock) contributes to its mechanical weakness. More extensive decompression melting of the asthenosphere takes place where it wells upwards, and this is the most important source of magma on Earth. It is the source of mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) and of some magmas that erupt above subduction zones or in regions of continental rifting.

== Characteristics ==
The asthenosphere is a part of the upper mantle just below the lithosphere that is involved in plate tectonic movement and isostatic adjustments. It is composed of peridotite, a rock containing mostly the minerals olivine and pyroxene. The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is conventionally taken at the isotherm. Closer to the surface at lower temperatures, the mantle behaves rigidly; deeper below the surface at higher temperatures, the mantle moves in a ductile fashion. The asthenosphere is where the mantle rock most closely approaches its melting point, and a small amount of melt is likely to present in this layer.

Seismic waves pass relatively slowly through the asthenosphere compared to the overlying lithospheric mantle. Thus, it has been called the &quot;low-velocity zone&quot; (LVZ), although the two are not strictly the same; the lower boundary of the LVZ lies at a depth of , whereas the base of the asthenosphere lies at a depth of about . The LVZ also has a high seismic attenuation (seismic waves moving through the asthenosphere lose energy) and significant anisotropy (shear waves polarized vertically have a lower velocity than shear waves polarized horizontally). The discovery of the LVZ alerted seismologists to the existence of the asthenosphere and gave some information about its physical properties, as the speed of seismic waves decreases with decreasing rigidity.
This decrease in seismic wave velocity from the lithosphere to the asthenosphere could be caused by the presence of a very small percentage of melt in the asthenosphere, though since the asthenosphere transmits S waves, it cannot be fully melted.

In the oceanic mantle, the transition from the lithosphere to the asthenosphere (the LAB) is shallower than for the continental mantle (about 60 km in some old oceanic regions) with a sharp and large velocity drop (5–10%). At the mid-ocean ridges, the LAB rises to within a few kilometers of the ocean floor.

The upper part of the asthenosphere is believed to be the zone upon which the great rigid and brittle lithospheric plates of the Earth&#x27;s crust move about. Due to the temperature and pressure conditions in the asthenosphere, rock becomes ductile, moving at rates of deformation measured in cm/yr over lineal distances eventually measuring thousands of kilometers. In this way, it flows like a convection current, radiating heat outward from the Earth&#x27;s interior. Above the asthenosphere, at the same rate of deformation, rock behaves elastically and, being brittle, can break, causing faults. The rigid lithosphere is thought to &quot;float&quot; or move about on the slowly flowing asthenosphere, enabling isostatic equilibrium and allowing the movement of tectonic plates.

== Boundaries ==
The asthenosphere extends from an upper boundary at approximately below the surface to a lower boundary at a depth of approximately .

=== Lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary ===
The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) is relatively sharp and likely coincides with the onset of partial melting or a change in composition or anisotropy. Various definitions of the boundary reflect various aspects of the boundary region. In addition to the mechanical boundary defined by seismic data, which reflects the transition from the rigid lithosphere to ductile asthenosphere, these include a thermal boundary layer, above which heat is transported by thermal conduction and below which heat transfer is mainly convective; a rheological boundary, where the viscosity drops below about 1021 Pa-s; and a chemical boundary layer, above which the mantle rock is depleted in volatiles and enriched in magnesium relative to the rock below.

=== Lower boundary of asthenosphere ===
The lower boundary of the asthenosphere, the top of the tentatively defined mesosphere or mesospheric shell, is less well-defined, but has been placed at the base of the upper mantle. This boundary is neither seismically sharp nor well understood but is approximately coincident with the complex 670 km discontinuity. This discontinuity is generally linked to the transition from mantle rock containing ringwoodite to mantle rock containing bridgmanite and periclase.

==Origin==
The mechanical properties of the asthenosphere are widely attributed to the partial melting of the rock. It is likely that a small amount of melt is present through much of the asthenosphere, where it is stabilized by the traces of volatiles (water and carbon dioxide) present in the mantle rock. However, the likely amount of melt, not more than about 0.1% of the rock, seems inadequate to fully explain the existence of the asthenosphere. This is not enough melt to fully wet grain boundaries in the rock, and the effects of melt on the mechanical properties of the rock are not expected to be significant if the grain boundaries are not fully wetted. The sharp lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is also difficult to explain by partial melting alone. It is possible that the asthenosphere is a zone of minimum water solubility in mantle minerals so that more water is available to form greater quantities of melt. Another possible mechanism for producing mechanical weakness is grain boundary sliding, where grains slide slightly past each other under stress, lubricated by the traces of volatiles present. Weakening below oceanic plates is partly caused by their motion itself, thanks to the non-linear dislocation creep mechanism.

Numerical models of mantle convection in which the viscosity is dependent both on temperature and strain rate reliably produce an oceanic asthenosphere, suggesting that strain-rate weakening is a significant contributing mechanism, and explaining the particularly weak asthenosphere below the Pacific plate.

== Magma generation ==
Decompression melting of asthenospheric rock creeping towards the surface is the most important source of magma on Earth. Most of this erupts at mid-ocean ridges to form the distinctive mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) of the ocean crust. Magmas are also generated by decompressional melting of the asthenosphere above subduction zones and in areas of continental rifting.

Decompression melting in upwelling asthenosphere likely begins at a depth as great as , where the small amounts of volatiles in the mantle rock (about 100 ppm of water and 60 ppm of carbon dioxide) assist in melting not more than about 0.1% of the rock. At a depth of about , dry melting conditions are reached and melting increases substantially. This dehydrates the remaining solid rock and is likely the origin of the chemically depleted lithosphere.

<doc id="145722" wikidata="Q300688" url="?curid=145722" title="Aabybro Municipality">
<text>Until January 1, 2007 Aabybro Municipality was a municipality (Danish: &quot;kommune&quot;) in the former North Jutland County, on the south coast of the North Jutlandic Island, bordering the Limfjord. The municipality covered an area of 170.88 km2, and had a total population of 11,390 (2006). Its last mayor was Ole Lykkegaard Andersen, a member of the Venstre political party.

Aabybro Municipality bordered Brovst Municipality to the west, Pandrup and Brønderslev Municipality to the north and Aalborg Municipality to the east and south.

The municipality ceased to exist as the result of &quot;Kommunalreformen 2007&quot; (the Municipality Reform of 2007). It was merged with the Brovst, Pandrup and Fjerritslev municipalities to form the new Jammerbugt municipality. The new municipality belongs to the North Jutland Region.

==History==
In the Middle Ages, Denmark was divided into syssels. The area that made up Aabybro Municipality was part of the hundred Han Hundred (Danish: &quot;Han Herred&quot;) and belonged to the syssel of Thysyssel. It later came under the fief of Aalborghus. In 1662 Han Hundred was merged with a number of hundreds and came under Åstrup, Sejlstrup, Børglum County. The county lasted until 1793. The area that made up Aabybro Municipality was under the hundreds of Øster Han Hundred and Hvetbo Hundred, both of which came under Thisted County in 1793. This county lasted until the 1970 Danish Municipal Reform where it came under the North Jutland County.

In 1842 Denmark was divided into smaller administrative divisions, namely parish municipalities (Danish: &quot;sognekommunner&quot;). The borders of these municipalities were largely based on the country&#x27;s parishes. In the 1970 municipal reform these parish municipalities were dissolved. Three parish municipalities were merged to create Aabybro Municipality. This municipality lasted until 2007 when it was merged with the municipalities of Brovst, Pandrup and Fjerritslev to form Jammerbugt Municipality.

===Historical divisions===
==Towns==

Approximately 40% of the municipality&#x27;s population lived in the town of Aabybro. Around a fifth lived in rural areas or small villages, with the remaining approximately 40% living in the municipality&#x27;s larger towns and villages, these being Biersted, Birkelse, Gjøl and Nørhalne. Smaller villages in the municipality included Ryå and Fristrup.

Aabybro was the seat of the municipality. The town was located centrally, with the Birkelse to the west, Nørhalne and Biersted to the west and Gjøl to the south.

Below are the populations from 2006 of the five larger settlements of the municipality.

<text>Aars or Års, () is a Danish town with a population of 8,671 (1 January 2024) in Himmerland, Denmark. Administratively, Aars is the municipal seat of Vesthimmerland Municipality and biggest town of Vesthimmerland Municipality, Region Nordjylland since 2007 and it was also the seat of the mayor in the now abolished Aars Municipality. The town was founded in the 14th century. It is one of the four principal towns of Vesthimmerland, the other ones being Farsø, Løgstør and Aalestrup. Aars is a former railway town. It is currently the 76 largest city in Denmark just behind Ribe but in front of Helsinge on Zealand, Sjælland. It is the 11th biggest town/city in Region Nordjylland in front of Skagen but just behind Sæby. The town has the nickname Cimbri&#x27;s town (Danish: Kimbrenes by).

==History==
===Name===
The name Aars first appears in 1345. The site name researcher Svend Aakjær&#x27;s statement was that it originates from the Old Norse / Old English word árr or ármadr (Ar in old English). Which in Danish means the king&#x27;s ombudsman or earl. Another explanation is that it comes from the man name Aar / Ar.

===Aars stone===

At the church in Aars there is a rune stone with the following inscription: (front) Asser put this stone after his lord Valtoke, (backside) The stone proclaims that it will stand here for a long time, it should mention Valtoke&#x27;s varie. Valtoke full name was Valtoke Gormsson but he was also called Toke Gormsson, and he was son of Gorm the old (Danish: Gorm den gamle). He died in the Battle of Fýrisvellir and the stone was raised near Aars because he was Earl of Vendsyssel which is not too far from Aars, but how it ended up in Aars is not known. The rune stone was rediscovered in Aars in 1654. It is believed to have originally stood north-east of the church, probably as part of a memorial assemblage comparable to the Jelling stones.

===Års Herred===

A herred is a form of district or county. Års herred is known to have existed in 1345 and is believed to have come out of Hornum herred and Slet herred. From 1660, it was a part of Aalborghus Amt, but from 1970 to 2007, it was a part of Aalborg Amt until Aalborg Amt melted together with Hjørring Amt and created Nordjyllands Amt (English: North Jutland amt).

=== Railway town ===

In 1875, there were 782 residents in Aars parish. In a description from around that time of the city is said &quot;Aars with Church, Clergy house, School and Inn with Grocery Store, Bakery and Meltyard&quot;. In 1880 there was another grocery store. The end of the 18th century was there a post office.

In 1893, the city received a state railway station on the Himmerlandsbaner from Hobro / Viborg via Aalestrup to Løgstør. In 1899, Aars became Himmerland&#x27;s railroad junction. The private railway Aars-Nibe-Svenstrup (-Aalborg) got a terminal here and was extended in 1910 from Aars to Hvalpsund. The Great Rail Act of 1918 even opened the possibility that there should also be a Himmelland crossroads Aars-Arden-Bælum-Øster Hurup, but this course was never brought, like most projects in this law.

Aalborg-Hvalpsund Railway was closed in 1969. As early as 1966, DSB&#x27;s passenger traffic at Aars Station was terminated. The freight traffic Viborg-Løgstør continued with the expedition station in Aars, but ended in 1999. The station has been demolished, the track was taken up in 2006 and the former railway station is now shopstores. It will be used by the Himmerlands path to Viborg and Løgstør. Nature trail Nibe-Hvalpsund uses the railway line to Nibe, but follows Løgstørvej in the first 2 km towards Havbro.

===Aars Municipality===

Aars Municipality was formed by Kommunalreformen in 1970 which made the Parishes into municipalities and in the Aars municipality the town of Aars was the head city/capital/municipal seat of the municipality. The municipality covered an area of 223 km2 and had a total population of 13,284 in 2005. But in 2007, Aars Municipality ceased to exist and was merged with the former Farsø, Løgstør, and Aalestrup municipalities to form the new Vesthimmerland Municipality, with an area of 768.08 km2 (2013) and a total population of 38,277 (2008). The reason behind the merge was &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipal Reform&quot; of 2007) which merged many of the now former municipalities into bigger municipalities. Aars Municipality also had what is called a Municipality shield which was a Cimbrian bull (Danish:cimbrertyren) with a red background. The bull symbolized that the Cimbri were present in what was the area in Aars Municipality. Even though Aars Municipality is a thing of the past, the municipality shield can still be found around the city, for example in manhole covers and in the city entrance sign.

===Excavation===
The construction of a new bypass revealed 4000 year-old buildings. The archaeologists from Vesthimmerland Museum in Aars found a collection of houses they estimated to be around 4000 years old. However, there are only staggered tracks and other tracks, but overall, the findings show that the Aars area has been populated, and probably also densely populated for several thousands of years.

They have found traces of more houses. They assume that at least five of the houses are simultaneous. There is a trace of the plow type called an ard. Other things have also been found at the old houses. There have been found remains of an amber, ceramic cut, Flintafslags and two axes, a mountain axe and a single-grave axe.

== Buildings ==
=== The church ===

Aars Church is a Lutheran church. It was the church of the medieval . The original Romanesque building was extensively remodeled and was transformed into a cruciform church of considerable size in 1921. The oldest part is from around 1200. In 1937 Christian Andersen made the baptismal font.

=== The museum ===
Aars is renowned for the Vesthimmerlands Museum, with various exhibits on important regional cultural history and art. The museum was initiated in 1920 by Johannes V. Jensen, and eventually built in 1935. In 1999 the native artist Per Kirkeby and architect Jens Bertelsen designed the new extension buildings and the museum has some of Per Kirkeby&#x27;s artwork on display.

===Water tower===

The tower is called Aars water tower since it is located in Aars city. The tower is built right in the middle of a very old water tank from where the city&#x27;s original water supply went out. As it sounds, it was Aars&#x27;s water tower. The building has many beautiful handicrafts. In the past, the tower used to have a neon logo on top showing the Cimbrian bull from Aars and Aars Municipality coat of arm/shield, but it was taken down. The tower was also a shop where you could buy yarn and many other things like tea cups. But the shop moved away from the tower.

===Aars Cinema===
Aars Cinema is the local cinema and the only one in Aars. It is a union-driven cinema, where the tasks are mainly performed by volunteers.

It has two halls to show films in. Every weekend there are children&#x27;s movies on the program in the afternoon.

===House of music===
The &quot;Vesthimmerlands Musikhus ALFA&quot; began in 1995, when Per Kirkeby drew sketches for a house of music to be built in Aars.

As the economic conditions for such a project were not present at that time, the sketches were put away for a number of years, but in 2006, an opportunity emerged to realize the project. An EU grant of DKK 11.5 million became vacant, because the fiddle plug for the Aalborg House of Music &quot;Musikkens Hus&quot; project was waiting. In addition, the ALFA project received a grant of DKK 3.2 million from the EU. In 2008, Vesthimmerlands Musikhus ALFA (aka. Musikhuset) was finished, designed by architectural firm Kjær &amp; Richter in collaboration with Per Kirkeby.

The ALFA House of Music comprise a concert hall with room for 420 guests and several teaching facilities. ALFA is an acronym for Aalestrup, Løgstør, Farsø and Aars, the four largest towns in the Vesthimmerland municipality, thus symbolizing the regional status of this cultural center.

<text>Brønderslev is a city in Denmark with a population of 12,842 (1 January 2024). The city is the largest urban area in Brønderslev Municipality and is the municipal seat. It is the fourth largest city of Vendsyssel within the North Jutland Region.

==History==
The name of the town is derived from a local Norsemen chief, Brunder. Brønderslev was formerly known as &quot;Vester Brønderslev&quot;, in contrast to the neighboring &quot;Øster Brønderslev&quot;. As of 2020, Øster Brønderslev has a population of just 943.

Vester Brønderslev was once a small farming village. In 1682, it consisted of just 27 farms and 47 houses. The town was not initially located on any major thoroughfares and saw very little traffic. Thus, the town grew comparatively gradually. By the 1850s, however, an inn and an established market had begun to draw more traders to settle on the road near the city. In 1871, the Vendsyssel railway line opened which connected Brønderslev to Aalborg and Hjørring. The station was located in the old part of town and revitalized development in that area. By the 1880s, Brønderslev had its own post office, hospital, technical school, trade school, library, banks, pharmacy, and a daily newspaper. In 1921, Brønderslev was officially designated as a &quot;Købstad&quot; (English: &quot;market town&quot;). It has since become a major trading and industrial city in the region.

==Geography==
Brønderslev is located near the center of Vendsyssel and is nearly equidistant from the region&#x27;s two other large cities: Aalborg and Hjørring. The city is approximately 13–22 meters above sea level, with the terrain rising towards the northernmost parts of the city. The southern part of the city is characterized by meadow areas.

Southwest of Brønderslev is the large bog, called Store Vildmose. The bog is a natural attraction in itself, but it has also revealed many archaeological finds, particularly from the Iron Age. Brønderslev is home to the regional-museum of &quot;Vildmosemuseet&quot; (English: &quot;The Vildmose Museum&quot;), which focuses on the cultural history of Store Vildmose and the surrounding area. Vildmosemuseet is part of The Museums in Brønderslev Municipality which comprise a total of three museums, the other two being &quot;Try Museum&quot; and &quot;Dorf Møllegård&quot;, both of which are located in Dronninglund.

In 1994, the Hedelund Rhododendron Park was established within the city on the site of a beech tree park which had been there since 1890. The park covers an area of 7 hectares, making it one of the largest of its kind within the nordic countries. It contains more than 10,000 individual plants from over 130 different species of Rhododendron.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Education ===
There are three primary schools located within the city: Hedegaardsskolen, Skolegades skole, and Søndergades skole. The city&#x27;s secondary school, Brønderslev Gymnasium of HF, was first proposed by the city council in 1953, though it did not officially open until 1973. As of 2007, the gymnasium is an independent institution.

Nordjyllands Idrætshøjskole is an athletic folk high school which has been located in the city since 1986. The land on which it sits had previously been used for agriculture and was purchased by the municipality which then built the school&#x27;s facilities.

===Transportation===
Brønderslev is served by Brønderslev railway station. It is located on the Aalborg-Hjørring-Frederikshavn railway line and offers direct InterCity services to Copenhagen and Frederikshavn, along with regional train services to Aalborg and Frederikshavn.

The E39 motorway passes by Brønderslev. Since the completion of a bypass around the city in 2000, there is no heavy traffic directly through the city.
==Religion==
The Church of Denmark has two churches within the city. Brønderslev Gamle Kirke was originally built during the 12th century in the romanesque style. Brønderslev Church was built in 1920 to accommodate the town&#x27;s growing population.

Also located within the city is the Brønderslev International Apostolic Church.

<doc id="145729" wikidata="Q3167139" url="?curid=145729" title="Fjerritslev">
<text>Fjerritslev is a town in North Jutland, Denmark. It is located in Jammerbugt Municipality, 13 km north of Løgstør, 37 km northeast of Thisted and 30 km southwest of Aabybro.

Until 1 January 2007 Fjerritslev was the seat of the former Fjerritslev Municipality.

==History==
Fjerritslev is mentioned in 1487 under the name Fieridsleff.

Until the middle of the 1800s Fjerritslev only consisted of a series of spread-out houses and farms. A tavern was built in Fjerritslev in 1840, which began the expansion of the town. Following the tavern was other establishments, including a post office, bank, school and brewery. With the construction of the train station in 1897, the town began to rapidly expand.

During the German occupation of Denmark in 1940-45 multiple buildings in the town was occupied by the Germans. This included the school, which forced the locals to move their teaching facilities to the town&#x27;s tavern.

The train station in Fjerritslev was shut down in 1969.

In the 1970 Danish Municipal Reform seven parish municipalities were merged to form Fjerritslev Municipality, with the municipality&#x27;s seat and main town being Fjerritslev. The municipality lasted until 2007 where it was merged with Aabybro Municipality, Pandrup Municipality and Brovst Municipality to form Jammerbugt Municipality.

In 1979 Fjerritslev Gymnasium (upper secondary high school) was founded. As of 2022, it has approximately 375 students and also offers Higher Preparatory Examination (HF) and Higher Commercial Examination (HHX). Since 2016 it has been possible for the students to also stay at Fjerritslev College. This has made Fjerritslev Gymnasium more attractive for students from other regions of Denmark and even from abroad.

==Fjerritslev Brewery and Local Museum==
Fjerritslev Brewery and Local Museum (Danish: &quot;Fjerritslev Bryggeri- og Egnsmuseum&quot;) is located in Fjerritslev. It is both a brewery museum and a local museum. The brewery, originally named &quot;P. Kjeldgaards Bryggeri&quot;, originates from 1885, where it was started by Niels Borup and Peter Bauer. Per Kjeldgaard joined in 1887. When Kjeldgaard died in 1919 his wife, Kathrine Kjeldgaard, took over leading the brewery. She became the only Danish female brewery owner until her death in 1950. Her daughter, Kirsten Kjeldgaard, took over and continued the brewery until 1968 where it was shut down. She lived in the old brewery until 1982 where she died. The current museum was established one year later.

== Notable residents ==
* Rikke Nielsen (born 1977), handball player
* Thomas Danielsen (born 1983), politician and MF
* Mikkel B. Andersen (born 1996), speedway rider

<doc id="145730" wikidata="Q27452" url="?curid=145730" title="Frederikshavn">
<text>Frederikshavn () is a Danish town in Frederikshavn municipality, Region Nordjylland, on the northeast coast of the Jutland peninsula in northern Denmark. Its name translates to &quot;Frederik&#x27;s harbor&quot;. It was originally named Fladstrand.

The town has a population of 22,838 (1 January 2024), and is an important traffic portal with its ferry connections to Gothenburg in Sweden. The town is well known for fishing and its fishing and industrial harbours.

Frederikshavn&#x27;s oldest district, Fiskerklyngen, is originally from the mid-16th century, but the houses now there are from 18th–19th centuries.

==History==
Frederikshavn was originally called &quot;Fladstrand&quot; (lit. &quot;Flat beach&quot;) from its location in Flade parish.
===Fladstrand===
The first mention of a settlement is in a letter dated 13 March 1572 found in the Danish chancery letterbooks. It was a fishing village, trading place and crossing point to Norway.

The old Fladstrand church was built between 1686 and 1690. On 31 December 1700 a tax of 500 rigsdaler was put on the town which indicates a fair amount of trade.

During the Great Nordic War from 1700 to 1721 the town saw a rise in activity as travellers to Norway embarked from here as the route over Sweden was cut. The activity slowly subsided after the war.

A royal maritime pilot was stationed at the town from 1733 after King Christian VI was forced to stay in the town due to bad weather on his journey to Norway.

In 1735 the town was described as a hamlet which supports itself on fishing and beaching of scows and some farming (fæstebønder).

===Military history in 17th, 18th and 19th centuries===
Due to its advantageous proximity to the entrance to the Baltic Sea, Frederikshavn has historically been a naval base of some strategic importance.

In 1627 under Kejserkrigen, Melchior von Hatzfeldt troops built a Sconce north of the fishing village. The sconce became known as &quot;Nordre Skanse&quot; and is preserved to this day. After the war this was manned by Danish troops. In 1675 the fortification was expanded with a sconse south of the harbour. Between 1686 and 1687 the fortification was expanded again with a heavy tower, a wall and a port. It was described as a citadel. The tower is known as Krudttårnet, (lit. &quot;Gunpowder Tower&quot;). In 1891 the wall and port was demolished, but the tower has been preserved. Krudttårnet is incorporated in the municipality&#x27;s coat-of-arms.

During the Great Nordic War from 1700 to 1721 Peter Tordenskjold barricaded himself here in his fights against Sweden. In 1712 the Battle of Fladstrand was fought in the nearby sea between Swedish and Danish naval forces.

In 1735, 50 Danish men were stationed at the fortress. From the middle of the 18th century the military importance of the citadel was dwindling and some of the fortifications and building was disposed of. It gained new importance during the Gunboat War from 1807 to 1814, but its value diminished again after the war. The citadel was discontinued in 1864.

===Market town=== 
During the Gunboat War, the town saw increasing trade and activity. The first artificial harbour was constructed from 1808 to 1810 due to the war and after several years of strong promotion of the local merchant Frantz Übersax.

Denmark&#x27;s defeat in the war had a great impact in Fladstrand. The military left and the town largest source of income ceased. Denmark&#x27;s general economic crisis worsened the situation. The town did not have status as a market town, but trade, craft and other activities exclusive to market towns had happened unlawful in Fladstrand for several decades anyway. A majority of the population had livelihoods based on crafts, services and trade, not production. This was used by the local civil servant as an argument for giving the town market town status (). The harbour directorate () argued that it was a strategic place for a harbour and giving the town market town status and legalising the current activities would help with the upkeep.

On 25 September 1818 Frederik VI bestowed the town status as a market town under the name of Frederikshavn.

===From 1818===

During the 1970s the ship yard wanted to expand with a dry dock at the location of Krudttårnet. Between 1974 and 1976 the engineering firm Kampsax and the local contractor Trigon encased the tower in concrete and moved it 270m along teflon rails to its current location. The project was delayed when a storm broke a retaining wall between Christmas and New Year 1975 filling the new dry dock with water and causing the base beneath the tower to collapse. The movement was celebrated 5. August 1976 with the visit from Margrethe II of Denmark and her family.

Stena Line operated a ferry service from Frederikshavn to Oslo, Norway from 1979 to March 14, 2020. It was served by three different ferries named Stena Saga. From 1979 to 1988 by former M/S Patricia built in 1967. From 1988 to 1994 by later MS Stena Europe. From 1994 to 2020 it was served by MS Stena Saga. It was first closed temporary due to the coronavirus pandemic. The decision to close it permanently was announced a few days later on March 19. The Oslo route was reopened by DFDS Seaways on June 25, 2020 by the ferries traveling to and from Copenhagen which began stopping in Frederikshavn. There is a single departure and arrival per day. The route is serviced by MS Pearl Seaways and MS Crown Seaways.

==Economy==

Companies in the area include MAN/BW Alpha and the Navy Base Frederikshavn (&quot;Flådestation Frederikshavn&quot;).

Frederikshavn, like the rest of North Jutland, was hit with hard unemployment. The town&#x27;s largest workplace, the shipyard Danyard, closed in the late 1990s. This resulted in more than 2,000 workers being unemployed. Today there is still activity at the large ship building area, with many small companies renting space there. In summer 2008, the unemployment rate, like the rest of Denmark, fell to a minimum low record of approximately 2%.

As with many provincial municipalities around the world, some of its young people leave to large urban cities. However, the municipality is currently engaged in many innovative projects which are attracting tourists and aim to retain population.

Frederikshavn is currently beginning a transition to make it the first medium-sized city/large town in the world to rely exclusively on renewable energy resources for power, including transportation and cars. The process is expected to be completed by 2030. As of 2010, the city was powered 18% by renewable energy.

Martin Professional had a large presence before its closure in 2016.

===Port of Frederikshavn===

Port of Frederikshavn is the largest harbour in Frederikshavn. It is a commercial port owned by Frederikshavn Municipality. It includes a ferry harbour, a cargo harbour and a large service industry. It has historically been dominated by the shipyard industry and fishing. Frederikshavn was in the late 19th century the dominant harbour for large fishing vessels in Denmark. The European shipyard industry was hit with difficulties in the 1980s and Danyard, the largest shipyard in Frederikshavn closed in December 1999. The municipality took over the harbour from the state in 2001. The site of the former Danyard was over the next 20 years transformed into a business park and the activity gradually went from manufacturing to service.

===20152020 port expansion===
In 2015 a large expansion of the port was started. The first of three phases was constructed from 2015 to 2018 by contractor Per Aarsleff. The official delivery from the contractor was on 8 June 2018. The officially inauguration coincided with the towns 200 year anniversary as a merchant town on 25 September 2018.
The expansion makes it possible to receive larger ships and offshore installations, handle more bulk material and a flexible area for projects. The first phase added 330.000 square metre hinterland and 600 metre of quay with a water depth 11 metre. Most of the quay and hinterland areas in the first phase have been leased by Louisiana-based Modern American Recycling Services for an 11-year period. 

In July 2018 they secured a contract to scrap the two platforms from Tyra Field. They are expected to begin the first recycling assignment in 2020 and create more than 200 jobs.
Construction of Scandinavia&#x27;s largest bunkering terminal is underway on the new area. It will consists of 11 storage tanks with a combined capacity of 744000 m3. It is scheduled for completion by the end of 2020. It will be leased to Stena Oil. In November 2018 all the hinterland areas of the first phase have been leased. Five 2000 m2 large warehouses have been constructed on the new area.

The planning of the second stage of the expansion was started in June 2017. Construction started in October 2017. It is nearly completed as of December 2019. The second phase will add 170.000 square metre of hinterland and 400 metre of quay. The quay constructed in phase one will be deepened to 14 metres.

When the second phase is complete the total area of the harbour will be .

A further expansion in third phase is an option if there is demand.

===Naval Base===
South of the commercial port is Danish Navy Naval Harbour Frederikshavn. It is home to Danish navy 1st Squadron and Naval Operational Logistic Support Structure, OPLOG FRH. It is also the home location for the training ship &quot;Danmark&quot; and the royal yacht &quot;Dannebrog&quot;. It was home to the national icebreakers before their decommission in 2012.

The naval harbour was inaugurated on 2 October 1962.

<text>Hadsund () is a town in the eastern part of Jutland with a population of 4,965 (1 January 2024; 5,394 incl. Hadsund South). The town is located by the narrow strait of &quot;Hadsund,&quot; along an inlet of the Mariager Fjord. It is situated south of the city of Aalborg and north of the city of Randers. The town is a part of Mariagerfjord Municipality in the North Denmark Region. Until 2007, Hadsund was the administrative seat of Hadsund Municipality.

The area has had human presence since at least the Iron Age, though the settlement of modern Hadsund, centred around the ferry connection across the fjord, is first mentioned in 1736.

Hadsund houses multiple educational institutions, including &quot;Tech College Mariagerfjord&quot;, &quot;VUC Hadsund&quot;, &quot;Hadsund School,&quot; and &quot;Hadsund Produktionsskole&quot; in the area of vocational education. It is also home to a number of companies, including DAVA Foods, Nilfisk, and Bodylab. The western part of the greater Hadsund area is home to the oldest still-existing windmill in northern Jutland, Havnø Mølle, which was built in 1842 and operated until approximately 1927.

== Etymology ==
The place name &quot;Hadsund&quot; was initially used to refer to the waters of the narrow strait of the Mariager Fjord were the town now lies. The oldest written mentions of Hadsund come from the 15th century, when its name was recorded as &quot;Haddeswnth&quot;, &quot;Hadesundt&quot;, &quot;Haddersund&quot;, and &quot;Hadissunt&quot;.

The origin of the name &quot;Hadsund&quot; is not known with certainty. It is likely that the village of Haderup on the south side of the fjord was the source of the narrow strait&#x27;s name as the name &quot;Haderup Sund&quot; (English: &quot;Haderup Strait&quot;) may have been shortened to &quot;Hadsund&quot;. The first farms that emerged on the northern side strait around the turn of the 18th century were initially referred to as &quot;Sundhusene&quot; (English: &quot;The Strait Houses&quot;). It wasn&#x27;t until the 1850s that the name &quot;Sundhusene&quot; fell out of use and was replaced with &quot;Hadsund Husene&quot; (English: &quot;The Hadsund Houses&quot;), along with the houses on the southern side of the fjord.

== History ==
Archeological finds in Hadsund indicate that the area has seen human settlement since the Iron Age. A burial mound has been dated to as early as 250,000 BCE and a grave just north of the town has been dated to between 175–374 CE. 

=== Fjord crossing ===

Since the at least the 12th century, Hadsund has been a crossing point over the Mariager Fjord. However, little is known of the town&#x27;s history from the Middle Ages. The establishment of the settlement was tied Hadsund strait&#x27;s use as a crossing point, though its growth may have relied on fishing prospects in the fjord.

In 1682, Hadsund consisted of 3 farms and 3 houses with land, cultivating a total area of 56.3 barrels of land. During the 1600s, a permanent ferry service was established crossing the Hadsund strait. The ferry was then based on the southern side of the fjord, in what is now Hadsund Syd. There were three or four houses there to accommodate the customs officer and ferrymen. Between 1772 and 1802, the ferry&#x27;s base was relocated to the northern side of the fjord. In 1769, Erik Pontoppidan recorded in &quot;Den Danske Atlas&quot; that the Dalsgaard estate, located just east of village, was using the crossing at Hadsund as a loading dock for its agricultural goods.

=== Market town ===

Hadsund was officially founded on 1 December 1854 when it received trading post privileges (&quot;handelspladsprivilegier&quot;), though it was never granted market town rights. Before 1854, only the ferry terminals on either side of the fjord could conduct trade in the area. After trading privileges were granted, the village began to develop rapidly. Several merchants established warehouses, however the financial crisis of 1857 bankrupted three of four trading houses. Despite the setbacks of the financial crisis, the city continued to expand in the late 19th century. In 1861, a commercial port was established in Hadsund. The Hadsund Craftsmen&#x27;s Association (&quot;Hadsund Håndværkerforening&quot;) was formed in 1864 and became important for the town&#x27;s growth.

In 1883 a railway connection was made between Hadsund and Randers, and in 1900, another link was made to Aalborg. In 1904, a railroad bridge spanning Mariager Fjord was constructed, creating easier access to the hinterland south of the inlet. The city had two railway stations, Hadsund North Station and Hadsund South Station, which both closed with the railroad in 1969. The 1904 bridge across the fjord became an important connection for road traffic traveling between eastern Himmerland and Randers. The original single lane road quickly became impractical, and in 1976 was replaced by a new bridge.
=== 20th century expansion ===
By 1911, Hadsund had a school, church, railway connection, telephone exchange, pharmacy, postoffice, and water and electrical infrastructure. In 1914, Hadsund Technical School was established and in 1919 the police station was inaugurated. In 1920, the Old Maskinsnedkeri was built in the city.

In November 1931 a referendum was held on whether Hadsund should form its own independent municipality by separating from Vive and Skelund-Visborg parishes, which Hadsund was then divided between. The referendum did not have enough support and did not pass. On 27 January 1937 a second referendum was held, this time suggesting that Hadsund municipality be formed by merging the two parishes. This referendum succeeded and on 31 March 1937 Hadsund Municipality held its first meeting. 

Hadsund&#x27;s arms were granted to the city in 1937. The coat of arms shows mainly the 1904 bridge. The four waves symbolize the four villages that lie in the municipality: Skelund, Visborg, Vive, and Hadsund. The crescent shape symbolizes the new municipality, and the star represents longevity. The bridge was replaced in 1976, but its classic steel arches were never changed in the city arms.

Following the 1970 Danish Municipal Reform, Hadsund Municipality expanded to include territory formerly within Als Municipality and Falslev-Vindblæs Municipality. As the seat of the municipality, Hadsund had increasing influence over the region. However, the municipality&#x27;s population had been in decline since the 1960s, as agriculture became mechanised and rural areas became depopulated. The substantial growth which the town of Hadsund itself saw during the mid 20th century was not enough to offset the depopulation of the municipality&#x27;s shrinking rural settlements. The early 1970s saw the establishment of several industries in the town. A total of 7 companies were established by the mid 1970s.

== Neighbourhoods ==
=== City center ===
The city&#x27;s center is the oldest part of Hadsund and surrounds the main street, &quot;Storegade&quot; () which was established before 1800. The street was part of the main highway between Hobro and Aalborg until the road was reconstructed in 1970. It has constituted the city&#x27;s pedestrian zone since 1990.

At the northernmost end of Storegade is Hadsund Butikscenter, the only covered shopping center in Himmerland. Hadsund Butikscenter opened on 16 August 1975, partially housed in buildings formerly used as by Johan &amp; Axel Hornbech&#x27;s jam factory.

=== Hadsund Huse ===
Hadsund Huse, also known as Hedeparken, is located in the northwest part of city, next to the Secondary Route 507. The neighbourhood was first settled around 1855, when four houses were constructed along the road leading to Aalborg. The neighbourhood&#x27;s name Hadsund &quot;Huse&quot; reflect that these original houses were small homesteads. Today, the neighbourhood has around 275 residential properties.

=== Hadsund Syd ===
Hadsund Syd, originally &quot;Sønder Hadsund&quot; (English: &quot;South Hadsund&quot;) is classified as an &quot;independent urban area&quot; by Statistics Denmark, and its population of 441 (as of 2022) is not counted as part of the city of Hadsund&#x27;s population. The area developed around the original ferry crossing point of the fjord and lies immediately south of Hadsund bridge (about 250 meters). The former Hadsund South Station is located here.

=== Søndergårde ===
Søndergårde is located in the northern part of Hadsund. From the 16th century until the 1970s, Søndergård was an independent rural village, but slowly merged with Hadsund after the establishment of a residential area and an industrial area between the two. It is located 2km from Hadsund&#x27;s center and 3km from Visborg.

The neighbourhood&#x27;s name, &quot;Søndergårde,&quot; is a nod to its agricultural past, as -&quot;gårde&quot; is a suffix commonly used in the names of agricultural estates. In the 1787 census, there were seven houses and four farms in Søndergårde. Today, the neighbourhood has around 450 residential properties.
== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Much like the rest of Denmark, Hadsund is relatively dry and sunny with temperatures typically between 5 °C and 10 °C. Summers have an average maximum temperatures around 20 °C and minimums around 12 °C. Temperatures in the summer occasionally exceed 25 °C, though rarely reach beyond 30 °C. Autumn typically has temperatures between 6–12 °C and sees significant rainfall. The winters have average temperatures between -3 °C and +2 °C. Temperatures rarely fall below -10 °C and precipitation often alternates between rain, sleet, and snow. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for the region is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).
=== Natural environment ===
Hadsund is surrounded by several forests, including Marienhøj Plantage, of which 20 hectares has been protected since 1956. To the west of the city lies Linddalene, a forest which has been protected since 1992. Lindalene was originally part of the Dalsgaard estate, but is today owned Mariagerfjord Municipality. The north-western corner of the forest contains Lindhøj, the city&#x27;s Iron Age burial mound which has been protected since 1937. A beech and deciduous forest called Thygeslund Skov is located on the western side of Hadsund. 12 hectares of the forest have been protected in 1951 to prevent urban development in the habitat closest to the fjord.

<text>Hirtshals is a town and seaport on the coast of Skagerrak on the island of Vendsyssel-Thy at the top of the Jutland peninsula in northern Denmark, Europe. It is located in Hjørring municipality in Region Nordjylland. The town of Hirtshals has a population of 5,434 (1 January 2024). Located on the Skagerrak, it is especially known for its fishing and ferry harbours.

== History ==


The town of Hirtshals developed around the artificial harbour which was constructed between 1919 and 1931. In 1925, the Hjørring-Hirtshals railway line opened to link the port of Hirtshals with the Danish rail network. In 1966, the harbour was expanded and became one of the largest fishing ports in Denmark. On 8 September 1989, Partnair Flight 394 crashed off the coast of Hirtshals killing all 55 passengers on board making it the worst in Denmark&#x27;s history. 

Until 1 January 2007, Hirtshals was also the seat of Hirtshals Municipality which was merged with existing Hjørring, Løkken-Vrå, and Sindal municipalities to form an enlarged Hjørring Municipality.

== Geography ==

Hirtshals is located on the sand and clay promontory &quot;Hirtshals&quot;, overlooking the Skagerrak between the Jammer Bay and the Tannis Bay. The shoreline is backed by low cliffs, beneath which is a narrow and rocky beach.

=== Cityscape ===

The town&#x27;s 35-metre-high lighthouse, &quot;Hirtshals fyr&quot;, is a local landmark. Building was begun on 28 June 1860, and it was first lit on 1 January 1863. It is constructed of red brick and covered with Dutch tile.

=== Climate ===


The sea level has been as high as 1 metre over the norm. But in days where there is no wind, the waves typically will not be higher than maximum over normal sea level.

Due to the proximity of the town to the coast, sea fog is not an uncommon occurrence. In the winter, the air temperature can fall as low as 1.6 degrees, but in the summer, it can reach over 25 degrees Celsius.

==== Waves ====

Hirtshals Havnekontor (Hirtshals&#x27; Harbour Office) keeps track of wave periods. Annual wave periods fluctuate between half a second, up to about 9 seconds. According to Hirtshals Havnekontor (Hirtshals&#x27; Harbour Office) normal wave heights are between 2 and 2.5 metres.

==== Wind ====

The prevailing wind in Hirtshals is to the south or south-west. Wind speeds vary all year long, usually topping at 10 m/s during the winter.

== Economy ==

Fishing plays a big role for the town and its inhabitants, as does tourism and the renting of summer homes.
Due to the ferry connections with Norway, the shops in Hirtshals thrive on the large number of visitors, especially Norwegians, who shop in the small town all year long.
Hirtshals also provides good employment in manufacturing industries like ‘Jackson, Lilleheden and Scanvogn’.

== Culture ==
It is the home of one of the largest aquariums in Europe, the Nordsøen Oceanarium. This was built in 1984 as Nordsømuseet, The North Sea Museum, and got its present name after it was extended in 1998 to include a fish tank containing 4.5 million litres of water, making it the largest in northern Europe. The Oceanarium has 70 different species in its collection. A fire in December 2003 destroyed the new extension, but it was rebuilt and reopened on 22 July 2005.

The 2014 Danish film &quot;The Sunfish&quot; is set in Hirtshals.

== Transportation ==

=== Port of Hirtshals ===

Hirtshals is the Danish terminal for the services of the Norwegian ferry company, Color Line. Each year thousands of tourists travel back and forth between Hirtshals and the Norwegian cities of Kristiansand and Larvik. Previously, Color Line also offered services to Bergen, Stavanger and Oslo, but decided to stop operating these routes in early 2008. Another ferry operator, Fjord Line, now operates a route to Bergen, Stavanger, Kristiansand and Langesund. It has also been possible since autumn 2010 to travel to Tórshavn in the Faroe Islands and to Seyðisfjörður in Iceland with Smyril Line. The port has LNG facilities for the ferries, and hosts the first wind farm built without subsidies.

===Railway stations===
The Hirtshals railway line connects Hirtshals with Hjørring and the rest of the Danish rail network. Hirtshals railway station is the principal railway station of the town. The town is also served by the railway halts Lilleheden and Emmersbæk.

<text>Læsø (&quot;Isle of Hlér&quot;) is the largest island in the North Sea bay of Kattegat, and is located off the northeast coast of the Jutland Peninsula, the Danish mainland. Læsø is also the name of the municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) on that island. The island is a location mentioned in several instances in Old Norse sources detailing Norse mythology.

In a 2010 survey, readers of the Danish newspaper &quot;Kristeligt Dagblad&quot; voted Læsø as Denmark&#x27;s second most wonderful island, behind only Fur (island).

==Name and Norse mythology==

The modern Danish form of the island&#x27;s name, &quot;læsø&quot;, developed from Old Norse &quot;Hlésey&quot;, meaning &#x27;Hlér&#x27;s island&#x27;. Hlér (Old Norse &#x27;sea&#x27;), also known as &quot;Ægir&quot; (also Old Norse &#x27;sea&#x27;), is a jötunn and personification of the sea in Norse mythology whose nine daughters personify waves. Similarly, the Danish city of Lejre may also derive from &quot;Hlér&quot;.

In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Hárbarðsljóð&quot;, the god Thor comments that it was on Hlésey that he was attacked by (and so fought) &quot;berserk women&quot; or &quot;brides of berserks&quot; who had bewitched all of the men on the island. Thor details that, upon beaching his ship, the women battered it, threatened him with iron clubs and chased his servant, Þjálfi:

These &quot;women&quot; are personified waves and/or jötnar. The island is also a setting in the poems &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana II&quot; and &quot;Oddrúnargrátr&quot;, the saga &quot;Örvar-Odds saga&quot;, in two skaldic kennings, and the aforementioned (see etymology section above) &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;.

==The Municipality of Læsø==

The municipality is in Region Nordjylland in northern Denmark. The municipality, Denmark&#x27;s least populous, covers Læsø and neighboring small islands for a total area of , and has a total population of 1,789 as of 1. January 2023. The population has been steadily declining, and according to Danmarks Statistik (Statistikbanken.dk) was: 

Its mayor is Karsten Nielsen as of 2021. He is a member of the Venstre political party.

The main town and the site of its municipal council is Byrum.

Because Læsø is an island and lies in the Kattegat, its neighboring municipality, Frederikshavn on the Jutland peninsula, is separated by water, the &quot;Læsø Rende&quot;, from the island municipality.

Ferry service connects Frederikshavn on the Jutland peninsula to the municipality at the town of Vesterø Havn while Østerby Havn is the island&#x27;s fishing harbour.

Læsø Municipality was not merged with any adjacent municipality under the municipal reform of 2007, as it agreed to enter into a &quot;municipal cooperation agreement&quot; with Frederikshavn Municipality.

===Municipal council===
Læsø&#x27;s municipal council consists of 9 members, elected every four years.

Below are the municipal councils elected since the Municipal Reform of 2007.

==Nature and protections==
Læsø has an outstanding botanical interest. The nature-types on and around Læsø includes open water, extensive mudflats, sand banks, heathland, islets and areas of arable land. It houses Denmark&#x27;s largest tidal saltmarsh outside the Wadden Sea but the decline in grazing animals has led to a gradual vegetational succession. Invasive species are colonizing the site, especially Japanese Rose, and scrub clearance has been implemented to re-establish the former pastures open heathland. Seals like the Harbor seal are breeding around Læsø and the whole area is an internationally important area for wintering, molting and staging waterbirds. Therefore, a Ramsar protection was put into force in 1977 (number 149) and today it encompass 66,548 ha.

==Climate, industry, and wildlife==
Together with Anholt, Læsø belongs to the Danish &quot;desert belt&quot;; during the summer months there is so little rain that streams and ponds partly dry up.

In the Middle Ages, the island was known for its salt industry. The ground water can reach over 15 percent salt, and this was naturally concentrated in flat salt meadows during the hot dry summers. The final concentration, carried out in hundreds of salt kilns, consumed large amounts of wood. Eventually the island became deforested, sandstorms buried villages, and salt extraction was banned. Since the end of the 1980s it has been resumed on a small scale as an archaeological experiment and a tourist attraction.

Læsø is home to unique styles of Danish traditional music. Most of it is not played any more but has been preserved through intense documentation and research in the 1980s and 1990s.

The HVDC powerline Kontiskan crosses Læsø as overhead line. On Læsø, there is also a 160 metres tall radio relay mast.
In 1993 a conservation area was established for the &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; nicknamed the Brown Bee of Læsø, where it became illegal according to Danish Law to keep and import any other type of bee other than &quot;Apis mellifera mellifera&quot;, this was met with protests and a legal battle lasting eight years from other beekeepers of &quot;A. m. ligustica&quot;, &quot;A. m. carnica&quot; and &quot;Buckfast&quot; bees as they did not &quot;want to become a custodian of poor bees&quot;, they also stated that &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; was &quot;unproductive&quot; and &quot;not worthy of protection&quot;. They lost their case in 2001, and negotiations between &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; beekeepers and non-&quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; beekeepers were concluded in 2004, splitting the island in two between them, ending a &quot;history of sabotage of bees&quot; on the island. The &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; supporters claimed that they had &quot;introduced apartheid on Læsø for the bees&quot;.

<doc id="145737" wikidata="Q3414045" url="?curid=145737" title="Løgstør">
<text>Løgstør is a town in Denmark with a population of 3,963 (1 January 2024) It is located 47 km west of Aalborg and 64 km north of Viborg. Løgstør&#x27;s city centre consists of old streets with small houses built in the 1800s for fishermen and sailors. One of these houses was donated by Danish housemen to the author and poet Johan Skjoldborg (1861 - 1936) in 1918, who lived in the house until his death. It is located on Johan Skjoldborgs Vej.

==History==
The name &quot;Løgstør &quot;is mentioned for the first time in 1514, where the city is described as a fishing village. Later, the site developed into a charging and trading space, and in 1523 the city became a customs office. Løgstør is an old trading place that, like Nibe, flourished in the 16th century due to its herring markets, but it only got its first merchant&#x27;s rights in the year 1900. Over and over again, the merchant position from Aalborg set itself counter to neighbouring attempts to expand trade opportunities and create economic growth in the smaller communities. Already in 1598, Aalborgian complaints made a royal ban on Løgstør&#x27;s spirited trade in grain and ice cream. In 1752, Aalborg&#x27;s powerful merchants blocked the small harbour town&#x27;s application, as the merchants once again feared increased competition in the Limfjord area. In 1747 and 1751, Løgstør was ravaged by violent fires, and in these difficulties the population declined, so that in 1769 the city had only 392 inhabitants.

Due to the shallow harbour Løgstør had difficulty finding ships at Løgstør, and even fewer created after Agger Tangs were pierced at Thyborøn in 1825 so that they could now sail into the Limfjord from the North Sea. It was therefore decided to build Frederik VII&#x27;s Channel and Frederick VII was the king of Denmark. The channel was 4.4 km long, a width of approx. 25 m and a depth of 3 m and walked along the mainland west and southwest of Løgstør, so that it could be added to the shopping district. Several hundred ships passed the Channel every year, and at the end of the 19th century, almost 3,000 vessels arrived. year. A ferry through Løgstør Land was a shortcut to Løgstør Harbour and the canal closed in 1913 to shipping traffic. It was preserved for cultural reasons.
Agriculture gradually came to play an increasing role for Løgstør, and trade in agricultural products necessitated a better infrastructure. The harbor was therefore expanded, new roads were built and in 1893 the railway arrived at the city. Seven years later, the city acquired commercial property rights. In 1942 the Aggersund bridge was built over the fjord, and Løgstør&#x27;s catchment area was expanded to include the southern part of Han Herred.

==Buildings==
Løgstør Church is a neo-gothic building built in red brick in 1893 with a tall slanting tower facing west. Johan Skjoldborg&#x27;s grave is in the cemetery.

Close to the harbor lies Løgstør Grunde Fyr, built in 1908. There is a double stove with two wooden towers on a white, brick building. The lighthouse is considered one of the most distinctive lighthouses in Denmark.

Next to the harbour is Hotel du Nord, an old hotel with restaurant.

==Limfjordsskolen==
Limfjordsskolen in Løgstør is a special education school for young people with disabilities. The school was founded in 1969 by Åndssvageforsorgen, by the then County Council leader in the county of Nordjylland, Leo H. Jensen (1924-1997), who, as the first leader of the Limfjord School, 1969–1976, had also established the pedagogical principles. Limfjordskolen was transferred to the county of Nordjylland in 1980 and since 2007 is operated by Vesthimmerland Municipality. The school has 44 students aged 17-20 + years. The stay is usually 3 years.

==Løgstør municipality==

Løgstør is also a former municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) in Region Nordjylland on the Jutland Peninsula in northern Denmark. The municipality, including the island of Livø, covered an area of , and had a total population of 10,270 (2005). Its last mayor was Jens Lauritzen, a member of the Venstre (Liberal Party) political party.
A bridge connects the former municipality near Tolstrup to the town of Aggersund on the far side of the Agger Strait. The island of Livø lies off the former municipality&#x27;s western shores, and is partially a protected nature reserve.

On 1 January 2007, Løgstør municipality ceased to exist as a result of &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007). It was merged with Farsø, Aalestrup, and Aars municipalities, to form the new Vesthimmerland municipality, with an area of and a total population of 39,176 (2005).
