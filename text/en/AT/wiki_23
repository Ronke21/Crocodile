St. Nazianz was organized in 1854 as a religious colony by a group of German immigrants, led by Father Ambrose Oschwald, a Roman Catholic priest. The first settlers in the Oschwald group numbered 113 and came to the United States from the Black Forest of Baden, Germany, seeking religious freedom.

Oschwald and his group sailed for America on the Feast of Corpus Christi in 1854, on two separate ships. The voyage of one lasted 52 days, and the other 55 days. By the time they arrived in Milwaukee by train, several of the group had died. Oschwald bought of land in Manitowoc County for $3.50 per acre. His down payment was $1,500, with the rest paid in five installments.

In late August 1854, Oschwald sent six men to locate the land he had purchased. They took a boat from Milwaukee to Manitowoc, the county seat, then headed west by oxcart, getting as far as the place where Valders now stands. They then cut their way through the dense forest, arriving at their destination on August 27. The men named the site St. Nazianz, in honor of Gregory of Nazianzus. Oschwald followed on September 1 with more men, and the group began working to clear the land and build log houses. Soon after, work started on the community&#x27;s first church, a 32-by-24-foot structure, which was built by hand. By October 21, the church was half completed, and Oschwald celebrated the first Mass.

Settlers began going by the name &quot;The Association&quot; and agreed to share everything in common and work without pay. That arrangement continued until 1896. The group built shops and mills and the community was thriving within just a few years of its start. People began practicing trades, including blacksmithing, carpentry, masonry, shoemaking, woodworking, tailoring, barrel making, rope making, tanning, weaving, brick-making, baking soda, and brewing.

In the ensuing years, Oschwald helped start several religious organizations, including the Oschwald Brothers and the Franciscan Sisters of Christian Charity. Oschwald died on February 27, 1873, and was buried under the altar at the old St. Ambrose Church at the Loreto Monastery. Several years later his body was moved to a shrine near Loreto Shrine Chapel in the village.

The Salvatorian priests and brothers came to St. Nazianz in 1896, 15 years after the Society of the Divine Savior was founded by Father Francis Mary of the Cross Jordan in Italy. The Salvatorian priests and brothers and the Salvatorian sisters worked to improve the holding of the former association and built St. Ambrose Church in 1898.

===2000 weather incident===
Shortly before noon on May 12, 2000, St. Nazianz and surrounding communities were hit by a severe storm that caused major damage. The storm was initially considered a tornado but was later declared a &quot;thunderstorm super cell moist microburst&quot; by meteorologists. It was reported that the storm produced straight line winds. The National Weather Service reported that at least wind gusts were achieved. Residents who were in St. Nazianz as the storm hit said that it went from noon light to midnight darkness in a matter of seconds.

The storm roughly followed U.S. Route 151, with St. Nazianz and Chilton receiving the worst of the damage, caused largely by wind and hail. The hail ranged from golf ball-size to baseball-size. Many houses were destroyed by the storm, while others sustained major damage. Many cars were totaled or needed hail damage repair. The total damage caused by this storm to St. Nazianz and surrounding areas was estimated at $122 million. It was the state&#x27;s first storm to exceed $100 million in damage. No casualties were caused by the storm. The village has since recovered considerably.

<text>Valders is a village in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 962 at the 2010 census.

== Geology ==
The village is known within the state for its dolomitic limestone quarry, which produces harbor rock, gravel, and a very hard and weather resistant type of marble. The dolomitic limestone is Silurian aged Niagaran dolomite. Glacial sediments overlying the bedrock in the area consist of a pebbly and cobbly, sandy, silty glacial till known as the Valders Member of the Kewaunee Formation. The Valders Member was named after the village and the type section was described along the eastern side of the present day quarry.

== History ==
Valders was settled in the 1850s by immigrants from the Valdres mountainous region of Norway. The largest town in Valdres is Fagernes, but many immigrants arriving in Wisconsin came from the valleys of Vestre Slidre and Øystre Slidre, when hunger (&quot;sult&quot;) in these rocky hillside farms was far from unheard of. Valders did not really develop as a village until the arrival of the railroad in 1896, the traditional year of its founding. It was incorporated as a village under Wisconsin law in 1921, with William F. Christel as the first village president.
As the village was founded by Norwegians, it was natural that the first churches were Lutheran: Valders Lutheran parish, Our Savior Lutheran parish, and Gjerpin Lutheran parish. These were later combined into Faith Lutheran parish (ELCA). There is also a small Protestant Conference parish. After the arrival of the railroad, many German settlers moved in who were primarily Catholic, but no parish was developed for them. To this day, there is still a significant population of Catholics, including most of the area farmers, who worship at St. Gregory in St. Nazianz to the south, St. Mary of the Immaculate Conception in Clarks Mills to the north (presently joined to St. Michael in Whitelaw), or St. Thomas the Apostle in Newton to the east.

== Geography ==
Valders is located on U.S. Route 151 two miles east of the Manitowoc River. The city of Manitowoc lies ten miles to the east on Lake Michigan.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all of it land.

&quot;The greater portion of the surface of this township is gently rolling, the ballance is flat level land with but little swamp. The soil is 2nd and 3rd rate with a hard clay and gravel Subsoil. The township is timbered all over with Hemlock Birch Elm Linde Sugar Black Oak White and Black Ash Maple Ironwoods and some Pine. The Big Eau Plaine creek runs in a Southeasterly direction through the North part of the township, entering it on Section 5 and leaveing it on Section 13: the Eau Plaine is quite crooked and very irregular in width. The current is generally quick, with frequent small rapids, and a hard bottom of stone and gravel. The banks are generally dry, the bottom land is very uneven and subject to frequent inundation. The small streams run into the Big Eau Plaine: they have mostly a quick current, a hard gravel bottom and low banks covered with Alders.&quot;

===Edgar Library===
The Edgar library is a part of the Marathon County Public Library (MCPL), a network of nine public libraries throughout Marathon County, Wisconsin. Under the auspices of MCPL, the Edgar library (aka &quot;MCPL Edgar&quot;) is also considered a member of the Wisconsin Valley Library Service, one of 17 state-level library systems in Wisconsin.

In 1928, the Edgar Women&#x27;s Club obtained books from the Wisconsin Traveling Library and this functioned as the local library until 1946. In 1948 preschool storytimes began at the library. As the County Library grew and provided more services to the branch libraries, the village stepped in to provide building space so that the public would have a larger library to enjoy.

In 1973 the Edgar Library became a branch library of the newly formed Marathon County Public Library when the Wausau Public Library and Marathon County Library merged.

The county-wide building program funded the remodeling of the former Edgar Bank in 1994, giving the public more books, computers and more space for family and children&#x27;s programs.

Carey, the attorney for the Milwaukee, Lake Shore &amp; Western Railroad, November 18, 1891, about the time when that railroad struck the place; it was incorporated as a village from part of the town of Wien, April 16, 1904, and its first representative in the county board of Marathon county was W. A. Somers. At the time the railroad struck the place, C. S. Curtis of Wausau erected a large saw mill, which was in operation until 1910, when it ceased sawing. At that time there was a large profitable cheese factory in the village, owned and supplied by farmers in the towns of Wien and Cleveland. John Brinkmann and Emil Szebsdat, under firm name of Brinkmann &amp; Szeljsdat owned a general store, and George Wetterau kept the tavern or hotel in the village. Emil Szebsdat was also the village postmaster.

There was a nice state-graded frame schoolhouse with two “departments”: principal, Vallborg Hermanson, and assistant principal, Miss Gertrude Kurtzweil - an average attendance of forty-five pupils in both departments. There were two German Evangelical Lutheran congregations, holding their services in the schoolhouse and attended by the resident ministers of the town of Wien. https://wiclarkcountyhistory.org/neighbors/marathon/history/1913FenwoodHistory.htm

In 1911, the R. Connor Company of Marshfield, with its
Marathon County mill located at Stratford, set to work clear-
ing two sections of land four miles southeast of the village.
This project, no doubt, had much to do in checking the out-
ward flow of workmen and gave fresh energy to the entire
community. A spur track extending from the mainline to
Connor&#x27;s woods provided an easy and rapid means of trans-
porting logs from camp to the mill.
The cut of 1913 climaxed the Connor harvest at this
location and that season, two million feet of logs were decked
at one time at their rollway. For several years more timbers
were hauled into Fenwood from a 500-acre tract. This work
was contracted by John Wetterau and was finished in 1928.
These intermittent and spasmodic shipments marked the ex-
piration of the industry which had given birth to the village.
At one time the Chrouser Saw and Tie Mill was also in
operation in Fenwood. This mill was operated by George
Chrouser from 1908 until the late 1920s. The Fenwood mill
was a branch of the Chrouser mill in Stratford. It consisted
mainly in making ties for the railroad and custom sawing for
area people.
In the early 1900s, Fenwood was a booming lumber
town.
Proof of Fenwood&#x27;s past prominence as a lumbering
center is mutely evidenced today by unused and unusable
logging roads. These keep an endless vigil against a time,
never to come, when again one can hear the droning music of
a saw punctuated by staccato notes as steel meets steel, in the
rhythmic swings of lumberjacks, the dying symphony of the
north woods.
(This history of Fenwood was compiled by Lillian Bau-
man using many histories and newspaper articles from area
newspapers.)

<doc id="139356" wikidata="Q2222003" url="?curid=139356" title="Kronenwetter, Wisconsin">
<text>Kronenwetter is a village in Marathon County, Wisconsin, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 8,353. It is the largest village by land area (although Suamico is larger when its water area is added) in Wisconsin, and the third-largest community by population in Marathon County. It is part of the Wausau metropolitan statistical area. 

The residential community of Evergreen is located in the village. The former unincorporated community of Peplin was also located in the town of Kronenwetter before its incorporation into a village.

==History==
Prior to the formation of the town of Kronenwetter, the area was composed of several small settlements. Around 1855, a Native American named Keeler dug a canal, rerouting the Bull Jr. Creek over a drop to power a small sawmill he built. Other buildings were built, and the area became known as Keelerville. In 1857, Sebastian Kronenwetter moved to the area and purchased the Keelerville sawmill, making it quite successful. In the years to follow, Kronenwetter continued his success, owning a hotel and building a sawmill in what is now the city of Mosinee. In 1885, he was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly.

On November 11, 1886, the eastern section of the town of Mosinee was formed into a new town known as Kronenwetter. In 1902, Sebastian Kronenwetter died and was buried in the Mosinee cemetery.

Kronenwetter expanded around 1910 when the Worzella brothers purchased of land and built the Polish community of Peplin near the intersection of County Highway X and East State Highway 153. The brothers constructed a sawmill, store, office, blacksmith shop, and living quarters for the workers. To advertise their new community, the brothers printed brochures describing the area in Polish and sent them to major cities in the United States. They also put advertisements in Polish-language newspapers in those cities. To entice the Polish people to come, the brochures included pictures of beautiful farms, including buildings and livestock. Among the first to arrive were Vince Ruzga, Albert Wonsil and Alex Dyda. The Worzella brothers built homes for the settlers starting from $350 for a three-room house and $450 for a five-room house. The sawmill eventually was shut down, but others were built in the area and were supported by the community, as the lumber was needed for homes. The sawmills ceased operation in 1930. During those years, schools were built throughout the town and population expanded.

In the election of November 5, 2002, the residents chose by a referendum to create the Village of Kronenwetter from most of the town; this became effective on November 20. The first village board of trustees was sworn into office on January 13, 2003. On February 24, 2003, the village annexed the remainder of the town, dissolving the town as a legal entity.

Residents of Kronenwetter use the postal zip code of 54455 for the nearby city of Mosinee, though Kronenwetter has a larger population than Mosinee. In the spring of 2010, residents were surveyed by the US Postal Service to see whether residents would like to be able to use &quot;Kronenwetter, WI 54455&quot; as a valid address, and a majority of residents voted yes. The joint 54455 zip code went into effect in mid-2010.

<text>McMillan is a town in Marathon County, Wisconsin, United States. It is part of the Wausau, Wisconsin Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,968 at the 2010 census. The unincorporated community of McMillan is located in the town. A section of the Mead Wildlife Area is also located in the town.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.59%, is water.

==History==
The six mile square that would become McMillan was first surveyed in August/September of 1851 by a crew working for the U.S. government. In November 1853 another crew marked its section corners, walking through the woods and wading the streams, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:

&quot;This Township contains several small swamps, and some of considerable size. The(sic) is a great part of the land which is of poor quality, particularly so, that part of it which contains Hemlock &amp; Fir. The Soil(?) a poor quality, being clay [undecipherable] and rough &amp; uneven. There is a great part of it that the rocks lay(?) on the surface. The land which contains Hardwood(?) is of good quality &amp; would make good farming land(?).&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&quot;The Pine in this Township is of Poor quality &amp; scattering. This Township is well watter(sic), most of the streams [undecipherable]. There is one stream which runs through the Township is of sufficient size for Milling purposes being [indecipherable] high banks &amp; rocky bottoms. There is no improvement in this Township.&quot;

In 1874 B.F. and Charles McMillan built a sawmill on the Little Eau Pleine River, five miles north of the young town of Marshfield. The mill prospered and workers settled nearby. A school was started in 1881. A village of McMillan was incorporated with its own post office and the population grew to at least 200. But the nearby timber was eventually exhausted and in 1911 the sawmill closed. Most of the village gradually faded away, now leaving only the neighborhood known as &quot;Sugarbush.&quot;

As timber was cut, settlers bought the stump-clogged forties and began to carve out farms. These eventually focused on dairy, shipping their milk to local cheese factories.

In the early 1900s a community called Riverside coalesced where T crosses 97 and the Little Eau Pleine. It had a saloon, a grocery store, a feed mill, a blacksmith, and a school. It eventually faded away too.

After the timber was cut, some of the low land on the west side of McMillan wasn&#x27;t very suitable for farming. Little was done with it, it burned about every ten years, and much of it went tax delinquent. Krasin and Hartle bought some forties and tried to run a fur farm there. In 1948 the county made 37 forties a public hunting ground. That area reaches from west McMillan into the Town of Spencer along the Little Eau Pleine and has evolved into the McMillan Marsh Wildlife Area - now managed as part of the Mead Wildlife Area.

==Transportation==
===Airport===
The Central Wisconsin Airport (KCWA) serves Rothschild, the county and surrounding communities with both scheduled commercial jet service and general aviation services.

==Economy==
Wausau Homes Inc and Wausau Tile have their headquarters in Rothschild.

One of the larger employers in Rothschild is the Domtar Paper Mill. The mill was originally built between 1909 and 1910 by a group of local lumber barons. The mill produced its first reel of paper in 1910 and was incorporated under the name Marathon Paper Mills. At that time, the area that was to become Rothschild was still considered the Town of Weston. However, the company built and maintained several homes, a community hall, boarding house and general store. As the mill town grew around the paper mill, the area soon became incorporated as the village of Rothschild.

The paper mill has seen many upgrades over the years as well as changes in ownership. In the 1950s, the American Can Company purchased Marathon Corporation. In 1973, Weyerhaeuser purchased a large portion of the mill from American Can. Then again, in the 2000s, Domtar purchased the mill from Weyerhaeuser.

At its heyday in the early 1970s, the mill employed over 1,000 workers, operating four paper machines. Today, only one machine remains in operation.

==Rothschild Area Branch Library==
The library in Rothschild opened its doors in 1949 when the Rothschild Homemakers group worked with the county librarian to establish a branch library. First located in a small cloak room in the village hall, it soon moved upstairs to a larger area.

When a fire destroyed the village hall in 1968, the village constructed a new building for the library and village offices. In 1973 the Rothschild Branch Library became a branch of the newly formed Marathon County Public Library when the Wausau Public Library and Marathon County Library merged.

By 1998, the Village of Rothschild needed more office space and the library was in need of expansion. This led to the construction of a new library/village hall complex completed in March 1999. The Schofield and Rothschild Branch Libraries were merged to form a larger branch library that had more open hours and a larger collection.

==Geology==

===The Amberg and Athelstane Granites===
Amberg is located in Northeastern Wisconsin about north of Green Bay in Marinette County. The Amberg-Athelstane Granite is part of the Wisconsin Magmatic Terrane. The Wisconsin Magmatic Terrane is an area formed by a tectonic plate collision at about 1850 Ma. marked by the Niagara Fault Zone. The Amberg Granite is one of the most extensive in Wisconsin. It is well known for its great variety of color and texture. The two most common types are a fine-grained gray granite and a course-grained red granite known as &quot;Amberg red.&quot; These granites were a valuable commodity in the late 19th century and early 20th century, causing quarries to be started in the area.

Dave&#x27;s Falls is located about south of Amberg.

==History==

===Labor history===

There were several main companies in the Amberg area during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Amberg Granite Company was the first in the area and later, the Pike River Granite Company, which formed in large part due to poor working conditions at the Amberg Granite Company. The Amberg Granite Company was owned by William Amberg of Chicago and consisted of quarry operations in Amberg—the Argyle, Martindale, the Athelstane and Aberdeen. The Argyle and the Martindale quarries produced the fine-grained gray granite and the Aberdeen quarry produced the &quot;Amberg red.&quot; The Athelstane produced a gray granite, but course grained, similar in texture to the Amberg red. Much of their granite was used in Chicago for curbing blocks and street paving. It was also used for buildings such as, the Minnesota State Capitol, and buildings in Chicago and Cincinnati. The Pike River company produced primarily the fine-grained gray granite and much of it was sold as monumental stone because of its strength and attractiveness. However, in 1929, 500–600 cars of this stone was sold to the Universal Granite Company of Milwaukee to be used as breakwater stone. Although, once a thriving, profitable businesses, there are no longer any active quarries operating in the Amberg area. More about the history of these quarries and the surrounding area can be found at the Amberg Museum complex, this is located in the town of Amberg on Marinette County V, right off of Highway 141.

<text>Crivitz is a village in Marinette County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,093 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Marinette, WI–MI Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Crivitz was surveyed and platted in the summer of 1883. This work was filed with the Register of Deeds in Marinette County on September 10, 1883, by German immigrant Frederick John Bartels, who named the settlement after his home town of Crivitz, Germany.

The demographic character of the Crivitz area was shaped significantly after a typhoid epidemic in 1894, which shut down the sawmills. Hieronymus Zech (1849–1932), a mill operator from Chilton, took over operation of the inactive mills and promoted land sales to Polish immigrants, many of whom relocated from Milwaukee and Chicago. Zech built stores, houses, schools, and roads for the Polish colony. As a result, the local population today is predominantly Polish-American.

Crivitz was a town until 1913, when it was incorporated as the Village of Crivitz. The village hall, originally located at 600 Main Avenue, was later relocated at 800 Main Avenue. The downtown developed along Main Avenue in the 600 to 900 blocks from 1913 to 1924. In 1924 a devastating fire destroyed 22 buildings along the south side of Main Avenue. In 1927, the village was disincorporated and became the Town of Crivitz. The fire, disincorporation, and the start of the Great Depression in 1929 sealed the fate of Crivitz for many years.

A ski hill called Winterset was developed in Crivitz in 1961.

In 1974 Crivitz was once again incorporated as the Village of Crivitz, with the Village Hall at 800 Henriette Avenue. This was quickly followed by improvements in the water-sewer system, electrical system, and highway-transportation system. The village currently operates under its 1974 incorporation with a Village President (executive), a Board of Trustees (legislative), and a Municipal Judge (judicial). Village operations are carried out by the Public Works Department, Water-Sewer Department, Police Department, Fire Department, and Parks Department. In the 1980s the village business district moved to U.S. Highway 141 on the eastern edge of the village, along with the inclusion of Dyer Business Park in 2005. There has been no additional development in the downtown area of the village. The residential area has continued to expand both north and south between the railroad tracks and the Peshtigo River.

==Geography==
Crivitz is located at (45.233915, -88.006955).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

A story says that before the town was officially founded there was a restaurant where a cook with the surname Dunbar worked. Whenever the railroad stopped at that part of the area they brought food and supplies for the restaurant. The railroad workers said they were bringing things &quot;to Dunbar&quot; the cook.

== History ==
The origins of Goodman date to the late 1800s, when it was created as a logging community for the Sawyer-Goodman Lumber Company by the Goodman brothers: James B. Goodman (1841–1907), Robert F. Goodman (1844–1924), and William O. Goodman (1848–1936). The settlement was initially named &quot;Dunbar&quot; in 1899, and the name was changed to &quot;Goodman&quot; in 1915.

Robert F. Goodman&#x27;s son Robert B. Goodman (1871–1957) is thought to be one of the first loggers in the country to utilize selective cutting practices. During a 62-year period, starting in 1927, the Goodman Lumber Company removed 417 million board feet of timber. Today, due to the use of selective cutting the volume of timber available is of similar volume as there was in 1927. The town center contains the Goodman Club House, which had a ballroom, theater, and restaurant. This Club House was once known to draw well-known performers, and it&#x27;s recently reopened under new ownership.

==100th anniversary==

Goodman celebrated its 100th anniversary on August 8–9, 2008. It is estimate that over 4,000 people attended. Events included a play commemorating the founding of Goodman as company town, a lumberjack breakfast, a lumberjack exhibition, saw playing, a parade, and a fireworks display.

The population was 10,968 at the 2010 census. Menominee, Michigan is across the river to the north, and the cities are connected by three bridges. Menominee and Marinette are sometimes described as the &quot;twin cities&quot; of the Menominee River.

==Name==

The town and county were named &quot;Marinette&quot; after Marie Antoinette Chevalier (1793, Langlade County, Wisconsin – 1865, Green Bay, Wisconsin), an influential Métis woman who ran a trading post near the mouth of the Menominee River. Of Menominee and French Canadian ancestry, she came to be known as &quot;Queen Marinette.&quot; Her father was Bertrand Chevalier, a British trader of French Canadian ancestry, who was involved with an early trading post at Green Bay. Her mother was Lucy, the daughter of Menominee chief, &quot;Wauba-Shish&quot; (Great Marten).

Bertrand Chevalier brought his family, including Marie Antoinette, to Green Bay. There he took a young trading partner, John Jacobs, whom Marie Antoinette later married. They had three children together. In 1823 John and Marie Antoinette Jacobs settled in the village that became known as Marinette. Their son John B. Jacobs later plotted the town. Chevalier Jacob&#x27;s husband disappeared during a trading trip. She later married his partner William Farnsworth of the American Fur Company. They also had three children together. Marie Antoinette Chevalier Farnsworth continued with the trading post after Farnsworth left the area for the next frontier at Sheboygan. She was known for her business sense, fairness, and influence in the region, as she had ties to both the Menominee and European communities. After her death, Chevalier was buried in Allouez, Wisconsin. In 1987 her descendants had Chevalier reinterred in a sarcophagus at the Forest Home Mausoleum in Marinette. Her original tombstone is on display at the museum on Stephenson Island in Marinette.

==History==
The site of Marinette was first settled by a small Algonquin band of Menominee people, referred to by the neighboring Ojibwe as &quot;the wild rice people&quot; for their staple crop. The band consisted of 40 to 80 men and their families. They lived at the mouth of the Menominee River in the 17th and 18th centuries, which, according to their creation story, was the tribe&#x27;s place of origin.

Before 1830, French Canadians established a fur trading post at the settlement. The first European settler was Stanislaus Chappu, also known as Chappee. After the War of 1812, the United States took over this area and the fur trade. They refused to license Canadian traders to operate on the American side of the border, although prior to the war, they and the Americans had easily passed back and forth across the border. John Jacob Astor&#x27;s American Fur Company became most prominent in the region, although the fur trade was declining after 1830.

In the late 19th century, the city developed rapidly as a port and processing area for lumber harvested in the interior. Logs were floated down the Menominee River and shipped out on Green Bay to communities around the Great Lakes and to the East. In 1853, the population was 478; by 1860 the number of people in the growing community had reached 3,059.

Due to the lumbering boom, between 1890 and 1900, the population more than doubled from 7,710 to its peak of 16,195. At that time, it was the tenth-largest city in Wisconsin. It had a wide variety of businesses and a new courthouse, city hall, opera house, two hospitals, a street railway, more than a dozen hotels and boarding houses, thirty saloons, and major industries, including the Marinette Iron Works, Marinette Flour Mill, the A.W. Stevens farm implement company, and the M &amp; M Paper Company.

The saloons accommodated the many single men who worked in the lumber industry.

Although lumbering trailed off at the start of the 20th century, with clear cutting of some areas, the town has continued to take advantage of its position along those bodies of water. Three bridges cross the river to connect Marinette to Menominee, Michigan, often called its twin city. Lumbering still contributes to the area economy, but jobs and population declined when the industry slowed.

Marinette has a major paper mill (Kimberly Clark), and other plants such as Marinette Marine, a shipyard owned by the Italian firm, Fincantieri; Ansul/Tyco, a manufacturer of fire protection systems; Waupaca Foundry, KS Kolbenschmidt US Inc. formerly known as Karl Schmidt Unisia, Inc., cast and machined automotive parts; Samuel Pressure Vessel Group a manufacturer of pressure vessels and part of the Samuel, Son and Inc.

The county seat includes what is now the eastern neighborhood of Menekaunee, formerly an independent village. The first European-American settlers came to Menekaunee in 1845. For some time Menekaunee was also known as East Marinette. The name Menekaunee is of Menominee origin, from &quot;Minikani Se&#x27;peu,&quot; meaning &#x27;village or town river&#x27;.

Two Presidents of the United States—John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election and Donald Trump during the 2020 presidential election—have visited the town during their campaigns. Kennedy delivered a speech promoting expanded Farmers Home Administration loans and criticizing Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson, while Trump discussed his administration&#x27;s manufacturing policy, military buildup, and United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement.

<text>Brown Deer is a village in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. A suburb of Milwaukee, it is part of the Milwaukee metropolitan area. The population was 12,507 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The Brown Deer area was organized as part of the Town of Milwaukee in 1835, and the first white settlers began arriving around that time from New England and New York, including some settlers from Granville, New York. In 1841, the Town of Milwaukee was subdivided and the Brown Deer area became part of the new Town of Granville. In the 1800s, the town was a predominantly agricultural community, and many residents were of German and Irish extraction.

The Village of Brown Deer has its origins in a rural hamlet that formed at a crossroads in the northeastern quadrant of the Town of Granville in the 1870s. The area remained characteristically rural from the 19th century through the mid-1940s, when the post–World War II economic expansion caused a building boom in the area, and many of the farms were subdivided into suburban residential neighborhoods.

In the 1950s, Milwaukee mayor Frank Zeidler&#x27;s administration pursued an agenda of annexing unincorporated areas of Milwaukee County to grow the city. In 1951 and 1952, the city began proceedings to annex parts of the Town of Granville. Some residents in the Brown Deer area did not want their community to become part of Milwaukee and organized to incorporate as a village in 1953 in order to stave off annexation. Milwaukee challenged the incorporation, but after a protracted court battle, the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld Brown Deer&#x27;s right to incorporate. When the Village of Brown Deer incorporated on January 20, 1955, it had an area of 1.8 square miles.

In 1955, the Village of Brown Deer and the City of Milwaukee scrambled to annex more of the Town of Granville, with Brown Deer making five annexations by the year&#x27;s end. In 1956, the city and the village both attempted to annex all of the Town of Granville&#x27;s remaining territory. The municipalities began a court battle that would last until 1962. Most of Granville&#x27;s residents supported annexation by Milwaukee, but some favored Brown Deer&#x27;s lower tax rates. The Wisconsin Supreme Court initially awarded the territory to Brown Deer, before overruling its own decision and awarding the territory to Milwaukee in 1959. The courts reaffirmed their decision in 1962 when they ruled that Brown Deer&#x27;s 1956 annexation ordinances were invalid, and awarded sixteen square miles of the former Town of Granville to the City of Milwaukee.

In August 2013, the village was listed as 19th on CNNMoney&#x27;s rankings of Best Places to Live – Where Homes Are Affordable, the highest ranking community in the state of Wisconsin.

==Geography==

Brown Deer is located at (43.172858, −87.977899).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all of it land.

==Demographics==

As of 2000 the median income for a household in the village was $61,097. The per capita income for the village was $28,525. About 5.8% people of all ages live below the poverty line. The median value of owner occupied housing units was $175,600.

===2010 census===
As of the census of 2010, there were 11,999 people, 5,275 households, and 3,199 families residing in the village. The population density was 2,729.5 people per square mile (1,694.5/km2). There were 5,579 housing units at an average density of 1,267.95 per square mile (787.8/km2). The racial makeup of the village was 61.9% White, 28.6% African American, 0.04% Native American, 4.9% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 0.01% from other races, and 3.1% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.9% of the population.

Brown Deer is one of only three Milwaukee suburbs (Glendale and West Milwaukee being the others) where African-Americans make up at least 10% of the general population.

There were 5,275 households, of which 26.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 45.5% were married couples living together, 11.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 39.4% were non-families. 33.7% of all households were made up of individuals living alone, and 12.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.27 and the average family size was 2.91.

In the village, the population was spread out, with 20.9% under the age of 18, 7.5% from 18 to 24, 12.8% from 25 to 34, 20.7% from 35 to 49, 21.5% from 50 to 64, and 16.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 41.8 years. 52% of the population was female and 48% was male.

==Education==

Algonquin Elementary School was formerly located on N. 47th Street. It served kindergarten through 2nd grade until it was closed in 2007.

In 2007, the Brown Deer Schools merged Algonquin into Dean Elementary School (which formerly taught only K4 to 4th grade).

Dean Elementary School was formerly located on N. 55th Street. It served kindergarten through sixth graders but was closed and torn down in 2013. The school, now called Brown Deer Elementary School, serves K4–6th grade.

The former Brown Deer Middle School (5th to 8th grades) and Brown Deer High School (9th to 12th grades) were merged in 2013, so the school now serves 7th–12th grades.

Brown Deer Middle School/High School and Brown Deer Elementary School are located on N. 60th Street. Enrollment is about 1600 students in grades K through 12.

<doc id="139410" wikidata="Q579978" url="?curid=139410" title="Homological algebra">
<text>Homological algebra is the branch of mathematics that studies homology in a general algebraic setting. It is a relatively young discipline, whose origins can be traced to investigations in combinatorial topology (a precursor to algebraic topology) and abstract algebra (theory of modules and syzygies) at the end of the 19th century, chiefly by Henri Poincaré and David Hilbert. 

Homological algebra is the study of homological functors and the intricate algebraic structures that they entail; its development was closely intertwined with the emergence of category theory. A central concept is that of chain complexes, which can be studied through their homology and cohomology.

Homological algebra affords the means to extract information contained in these complexes and present it in the form of homological invariants of rings, modules, topological spaces, and other &quot;tangible&quot; mathematical objects. A spectral sequence is a powerful tool for this.

It has played an enormous role in algebraic topology. Its influence has gradually expanded and presently includes commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory, representation theory, mathematical physics, operator algebras, complex analysis, and the theory of partial differential equations. &quot;K&quot;-theory is an independent discipline which draws upon methods of homological algebra, as does the noncommutative geometry of Alain Connes.

==History==
Homological algebra began to be studied in its most basic form in the late 19th century as a branch of topology and in the 1940s became an independent subject with the study of objects such as the ext functor and the tor functor, among others.

== Chain complexes and homology ==

The notion of chain complex is central in homological algebra. An abstract chain complex is a sequence formula_1 of abelian groups and group homomorphisms, 
with the property that the composition of any two consecutive maps is zero:
: formula_2 

The elements of &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; are called &quot;n&quot;-chains and the homomorphisms &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot; are called the boundary maps or differentials. The chain groups &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; may be endowed with extra structure; for example, they may be vector spaces or modules over a fixed ring &quot;R&quot;. The differentials must preserve the extra structure if it exists; for example, they must be linear maps or homomorphisms of &quot;R&quot;-modules. For notational convenience, restrict attention to abelian groups (more correctly, to the category Ab of abelian groups); a celebrated theorem by Barry Mitchell implies the results will generalize to any abelian category. Every chain complex defines two further sequences of abelian groups, the cycles &quot;Z&quot;&quot;n&quot; = Ker &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot; and the boundaries &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot; = Im &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1, where Ker &quot;d&quot; and Im &quot;d&quot; denote the kernel and the image of &quot;d&quot;. Since the composition of two consecutive boundary maps is zero, these groups are embedded into each other as

: formula_3

Subgroups of abelian groups are automatically normal; therefore we can define the &quot;n&quot;th homology group &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) as the factor group of the &quot;n&quot;-cycles by the &quot;n&quot;-boundaries,

: formula_4

A chain complex is called acyclic or an exact sequence if all its homology groups are zero.

Chain complexes arise in abundance in algebra and algebraic topology. For example, if &quot;X&quot; is a topological space then the singular chains &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) are formal linear combinations of continuous maps from the standard &quot;n&quot;-simplex into &quot;X&quot;; if &quot;K&quot; is a simplicial complex then the simplicial chains &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) are formal linear combinations of the &quot;n&quot;-simplices of &quot;K&quot;; if &quot;A&quot; = &quot;F&quot;/&quot;R&quot; is a presentation of an abelian group &quot;A&quot; by generators and relations, where &quot;F&quot; is a free abelian group spanned by the generators and &quot;R&quot; is the subgroup of relations, then letting &quot;C&quot;1(&quot;A&quot;) = &quot;R&quot;, &quot;C&quot;0(&quot;A&quot;) = &quot;F&quot;, and &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) = 0 for all other &quot;n&quot; defines a sequence of abelian groups. In all these cases, there are natural differentials &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot; making &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; into a chain complex, whose homology reflects the structure of the topological space &quot;X&quot;, the simplicial complex &quot;K&quot;, or the abelian group &quot;A&quot;. In the case of topological spaces, we arrive at the notion of singular homology, which plays a fundamental role in investigating the properties of such spaces, for example, manifolds.

On a philosophical level, homological algebra teaches us that certain chain complexes associated with algebraic or geometric objects (topological spaces, simplicial complexes, &quot;R&quot;-modules) contain a lot of valuable algebraic information about them, with the homology being only the most readily available part. On a technical level, homological algebra provides the tools for manipulating complexes and extracting this information. Here are two general illustrations.
*Two objects &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are connected by a map &quot;f &quot; between them. Homological algebra studies the relation, induced by the map &quot;f&quot;, between chain complexes associated with &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; and their homology. This is generalized to the case of several objects and maps connecting them. Phrased in the language of category theory, homological algebra studies the functorial properties of various constructions of chain complexes and of the homology of these complexes. 
* An object &quot;X&quot; admits multiple descriptions (for example, as a topological space and as a simplicial complex) or the complex formula_5 is constructed using some &#x27;presentation&#x27; of &quot;X&quot;, which involves non-canonical choices. It is important to know the effect of change in the description of &quot;X&quot; on chain complexes associated with &quot;X&quot;. Typically, the complex and its homology formula_6 are functorial with respect to the presentation; and the homology (although not the complex itself) is actually independent of the presentation chosen, thus it is an invariant of &quot;X&quot;.

==Standard tools==

===Exact sequences===

In the context of group theory, a sequence
:formula_7
of groups and group homomorphisms is called exact if the image of each homomorphism is equal to the kernel of the next:
:formula_8
Note that the sequence of groups and homomorphisms may be either finite or infinite.

A similar definition can be made for certain other algebraic structures. For example, one could have an exact sequence of vector spaces and linear maps, or of modules and module homomorphisms. More generally, the notion of an exact sequence makes sense in any category with kernels and cokernels.

====Short====

The most common type of exact sequence is the short exact sequence. This is an exact sequence of the form
:formula_9
where ƒ is a monomorphism and &quot;g&quot; is an epimorphism. In this case, &quot;A&quot; is a subobject of &quot;B&quot;, and the corresponding quotient is isomorphic to &quot;C&quot;:
:formula_10 
(where &quot;f(A)&quot; = im(&quot;f&quot;)).

A short exact sequence of abelian groups may also be written as an exact sequence with five terms:
:formula_11
where 0 represents the zero object, such as the trivial group or a zero-dimensional vector space. The placement of the 0&#x27;s forces ƒ to be a monomorphism and &quot;g&quot; to be an epimorphism (see below).

====Long====
A long exact sequence is an exact sequence indexed by the natural numbers.

===Five lemma===

Consider the following commutative diagram in any abelian category (such as the category of abelian groups or the category of vector spaces over a given field) or in the category of groups.

The five lemma states that, if the rows are exact, &quot;m&quot; and &quot;p&quot; are isomorphisms, &quot;l&quot; is an epimorphism, and &quot;q&quot; is a monomorphism, then &quot;n&quot; is also an isomorphism.

===Snake lemma===

In an abelian category (such as the category of abelian groups or the category of vector spaces over a given field), consider a commutative diagram:

where the rows are exact sequences and 0 is the zero object.
Then there is an exact sequence relating the kernels and cokernels of &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot;:

:formula_12

Furthermore, if the morphism &quot;f&quot; is a monomorphism, then so is the morphism ker &quot;a&quot; → ker &quot;b&quot;, and if &quot;g&quot;&#x27; is an epimorphism, then so is coker &quot;b&quot; → coker &quot;c&quot;.

===Abelian categories===

In mathematics, an abelian category is a category in which morphisms and objects can be added and in which kernels and cokernels exist and have desirable properties. The motivating prototype example of an abelian category is the category of abelian groups, Ab. The theory originated in a tentative attempt to unify several cohomology theories by Alexander Grothendieck. Abelian categories are very &quot;stable&quot; categories, for example they are regular and they satisfy the snake lemma. The class of Abelian categories is closed under several categorical constructions, for example, the category of chain complexes of an Abelian category, or the category of functors from a small category to an Abelian category are Abelian as well. These stability properties make them inevitable in homological algebra and beyond; the theory has major applications in algebraic geometry, cohomology and pure category theory. Abelian categories are named after Niels Henrik Abel.

More concretely, a category is abelian if
*it has a zero object,
*it has all binary products and binary coproducts, and
*it has all kernels and cokernels.
*all monomorphisms and epimorphisms are normal.

===Derived functor===

Suppose we are given a covariant left exact functor &quot;F&quot; : A → B between two abelian categories A and B. If 0 → &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; → &quot;C&quot; → 0 is a short exact sequence in A, then applying &quot;F&quot; yields the exact sequence 0 → &quot;F&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) → &quot;F&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) → &quot;F&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) and one could ask how to continue this sequence to the right to form a long exact sequence. Strictly speaking, this question is ill-posed, since there are always numerous different ways to continue a given exact sequence to the right. But it turns out that (if A is &quot;nice&quot; enough) there is one canonical way of doing so, given by the right derived functors of &quot;F&quot;. For every &quot;i&quot;≥1, there is a functor &quot;RiF&quot;: A → B, and the above sequence continues like so: 0 → &quot;F&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) → &quot;F&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) → &quot;F&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) → &quot;R&quot;1&quot;F&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) → &quot;R&quot;1&quot;F&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) → &quot;R&quot;1&quot;F&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) → &quot;R&quot;2&quot;F&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) → &quot;R&quot;2&quot;F&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) → ... . From this we see that &quot;F&quot; is an exact functor if and only if &quot;R&quot;1&quot;F&quot; = 0; so in a sense the right derived functors of &quot;F&quot; measure &quot;how far&quot; &quot;F&quot; is from being exact.

===Ext functor===

Let &quot;R&quot; be a ring and let Mod&quot;R&quot; be the category of modules over &quot;R&quot;. Let &quot;B&quot; be in Mod&quot;R&quot; and set &quot;T&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) = Hom&quot;R&quot;(&quot;A,B&quot;), for fixed &quot;A&quot; in Mod&quot;R&quot;. This is a left exact functor and thus has right derived functors &quot;RnT&quot;. The Ext functor is defined by

:formula_13

This can be calculated by taking any injective resolution

:formula_14

and computing

:formula_15

Then (&quot;RnT&quot;)(&quot;B&quot;) is the cohomology of this complex. Note that Hom&quot;R&quot;(&quot;A,B&quot;) is excluded from the complex.

An alternative definition is given using the functor &quot;G&quot;(&quot;A&quot;)=Hom&quot;R&quot;(&quot;A,B&quot;). For a fixed module &quot;B&quot;, this is a contravariant left exact functor, and thus we also have right derived functors &quot;RnG&quot;, and can define

:formula_16

This can be calculated by choosing any projective resolution

:formula_17

and proceeding dually by computing

:formula_18

Then (&quot;RnG&quot;)(&quot;A&quot;) is the cohomology of this complex. Again note that Hom&quot;R&quot;(&quot;A,B&quot;) is excluded.

These two constructions turn out to yield isomorphic results, and so both may be used to calculate the Ext functor.

===Tor functor===

Suppose &quot;R&quot; is a ring, and denoted by &quot;R&quot;-Mod the category of left &quot;R&quot;-modules and by Mod-&quot;R&quot; the category of right &quot;R&quot;-modules (if &quot;R&quot; is commutative, the two categories coincide). Fix a module &quot;B&quot; in &quot;R&quot;-Mod. For &quot;A&quot; in Mod-&quot;R&quot;, set &quot;T&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) = &quot;A&quot;⊗&quot;R&quot;&quot;B&quot;. Then &quot;T&quot; is a right exact functor from Mod-&quot;R&quot; to the category of abelian groups Ab (in the case when &quot;R&quot; is commutative, it is a right exact functor from Mod-&quot;R&quot; to Mod-&quot;R&quot;) and its left derived functors &quot;LnT&quot; are defined. We set

: formula_19

i.e., we take a projective resolution

: formula_20

then remove the &quot;A&quot; term and tensor the projective resolution with &quot;B&quot; to get the complex

: formula_21

(note that &quot;A&quot;⊗&quot;R&quot;&quot;B&quot; does not appear and the last arrow is just the zero map) and take the homology of this complex.

===Spectral sequence===

Fix an abelian category, such as a category of modules over a ring. A spectral sequence is a choice of a nonnegative integer &quot;r&quot;0 and a collection of three sequences:
# For all integers &quot;r&quot; ≥ &quot;r&quot;0, an object &quot;Er&quot;, called a &quot;sheet&quot; (as in a sheet of paper), or sometimes a &quot;page&quot; or a &quot;term&quot;,
# Endomorphisms &quot;dr&quot; : &quot;Er&quot; → &quot;Er&quot; satisfying &quot;dr&quot; &quot;dr&quot; = 0, called &quot;boundary maps&quot; or &quot;differentials&quot;,
# Isomorphisms of &quot;Er+1&quot; with &quot;H&quot;(&quot;Er&quot;), the homology of &quot;Er&quot; with respect to &quot;dr&quot;.
A doubly graded spectral sequence has a tremendous amount of data to keep track of, but there is a common visualization technique which makes the structure of the spectral sequence clearer. We have three indices, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, and &quot;q&quot;. For each &quot;r&quot;, imagine that we have a sheet of graph paper. On this sheet, we will take &quot;p&quot; to be the horizontal direction and &quot;q&quot; to be the vertical direction. At each lattice point we have the object formula_22.

It is very common for &quot;n&quot; = &quot;p&quot; + &quot;q&quot; to be another natural index in the spectral sequence. &quot;n&quot; runs diagonally, northwest to southeast, across each sheet. In the homological case, the differentials have bidegree (−&quot;r&quot;, &quot;r&quot; − 1), so they decrease &quot;n&quot; by one. In the cohomological case, &quot;n&quot; is increased by one. When &quot;r&quot; is zero, the differential moves objects one space down or up. This is similar to the differential on a chain complex. When &quot;r&quot; is one, the differential moves objects one space to the left or right. When &quot;r&quot; is two, the differential moves objects just like a knight&#x27;s move in chess. For higher &quot;r&quot;, the differential acts like a generalized knight&#x27;s move.

== Functoriality ==
A continuous map of topological spaces gives rise to a homomorphism between their &quot;n&quot;th homology groups for all &quot;n&quot;. This basic fact of algebraic topology finds a natural explanation through certain properties of chain complexes. Since it is very common to study
several topological spaces simultaneously, in homological algebra one is led to simultaneous consideration of multiple chain complexes.

A morphism between two chain complexes, formula_23 is a family of homomorphisms of abelian groups formula_24 that commute with the differentials, in the sense that formula_25 for all &quot;n&quot;. A morphism of chain complexes induces a morphism formula_26 of their homology groups, consisting of the homomorphisms formula_27 for all &quot;n&quot;. A morphism &quot;F&quot; is called a quasi-isomorphism if it induces an isomorphism on the &quot;n&quot;th homology for all &quot;n&quot;.

Many constructions of chain complexes arising in algebra and geometry, including singular homology, have the following functoriality property: if two objects &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are connected by a map &quot;f&quot;, then the associated chain complexes are connected by a morphism formula_28 and moreover, the composition formula_29 of maps &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;g&quot;: &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;Z&quot; induces the morphism formula_30 that coincides with the composition formula_31 It follows that the homology groups formula_6 are functorial as well, so that morphisms between algebraic or topological objects give rise to compatible maps between their homology.

The following definition arises from a typical situation in algebra and topology. A triple consisting of three chain complexes formula_33 and two morphisms between them, formula_34 is called an exact triple, or a short exact sequence of complexes, and written as

: formula_35

if for any &quot;n&quot;, the sequence

: formula_36

is a short exact sequence of abelian groups. By definition, this means that &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot; is an injection, &quot;g&quot;&quot;n&quot; is a surjection, and Im &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot; =  Ker &quot;g&quot;&quot;n&quot;. One of the most basic theorems of homological algebra, sometimes known as the zig-zag lemma, states that, in this case, there is a long exact sequence in homology

: formula_37

where the homology groups of &quot;L&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, and &quot;N&quot; cyclically follow each other, and &quot;δ&quot;&quot;n&quot; are certain homomorphisms determined by &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot;, called the connecting homomorphisms. Topological manifestations of this theorem include the Mayer–Vietoris sequence and the long exact sequence for relative homology.
== Foundational aspects ==
Cohomology theories have been defined for many different objects such as topological spaces, sheaves, groups, rings, Lie algebras, and C*-algebras. The study of modern algebraic geometry would be almost unthinkable without sheaf cohomology.

Central to homological algebra is the notion of exact sequence; these can be used to perform actual calculations. A classical tool of homological algebra is that of derived functor; the most basic examples are functors Ext and Tor.

With a diverse set of applications in mind, it was natural to try to put the whole subject on a uniform basis. There were several attempts before the subject settled down. An approximate history can be stated as follows:

* Cartan-Eilenberg: In their 1956 book &quot;Homological Algebra&quot;, these authors used projective and injective module resolutions.
* &#x27;Tohoku&#x27;: The approach in a celebrated paper by Alexander Grothendieck which appeared in the Second Series of the &quot;Tohoku Mathematical Journal&quot; in 1957, using the abelian category concept (to include sheaves of abelian groups).
* The derived category of Grothendieck and Verdier. Derived categories date back to Verdier&#x27;s 1967 thesis. They are examples of triangulated categories used in a number of modern theories.

These move from computability to generality.

The computational sledgehammer &quot;par excellence&quot; is the spectral sequence; these are essential in the Cartan-Eilenberg and Tohoku approaches where they are needed, for instance, to compute the derived functors of a composition of two functors. Spectral sequences are less essential in the derived category approach, but still play a role whenever concrete computations are necessary.

There have been attempts at &#x27;non-commutative&#x27; theories which extend first cohomology as &quot;torsors&quot; (important in Galois cohomology).

<text>Fox Point is a village in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 6,934 at the 2020 census.

Located on the western shore of Lake Michigan, Fox Point is one of the North Shore suburbs of the Milwaukee metropolitan area. The village is primarily residential. Shopping centers include Fox Point Shops, and RiverPoint Shopping Center.

==History==
The Fox Point area has been inhabited for thousands of years. The earliest known inhabitants were Woodland period Mound Builders, who constructed earthen effigy and burial mounds in the area. Many of the mounds were destroyed by white farmers between 1850 and 1920. In the early 19th century, archaeologists also found traces of several Hopewell villages in the area.

The land was opened to European and American settlers in the 1830s, after the Potawatomi signed the 1833 Treaty of Chicago. The first survey of the area was conducted later that year, and the U.S. Federal Government began land parcels in present-day Fox Point in autumn 1835. Surveyors in the mid-nineteenth century noted a point that resembled a fox&#x27;s snout jutting into Lake Michigan at the present location of Doctor&#x27;s Park in the village. They originally called it &quot;Foxes Point&quot; before residents eventually shortened it to &quot;Fox Point.&quot;

The land was organized as part of the Town of Milwaukee in 1835, and much of the land was bought by land speculators, who cleared the old-growth forests for timber. The first permanent settler in the area was Cephas Buttles, who owned 160 acres in the Town of Milwaukee and built a cabin in present-day River Hills in 1843. In the mid-1840s, many families of Dutch settlers began arriving in the Town of Milwaukee. John Cappon was the first Dutch settler in Fox Point, building his cabin in 1846. By 1855, more than 20 Dutch families lived in Fox Point. The early settlers farmed the land with new techniques that allowed them to cultivate wheat, barley, rye, and corn in the clayey soil. In 1848, they built a one one-room schoolhouses and another two in 1852, including the Old Dutch Schoolhouse Site and Burial Ground, which is a Milwaukee County landmark. Two Dutch Reformed congregations formed in the community in its early years. The community&#x27;s demographics changed later in the nineteenth century. One of Fox Point&#x27;s first black residents was Calvin Reeves, a formerly enslaved man from Louisiana who moved to the community after the American Civil War with two Dutch-American soldiers returning home from the conflict. German immigrants also began moving to Fox Point in the 1860s, forming St. John&#x27;s Lutheran Church in 1866.

Fox Point changed significantly in the 1890s. Many of the originally Dutch farmers had moved to the City of Milwaukee and to the southern Sheboygan County Town of Holland, and the villages of Oostburg and Cedar Grove. By 1898, the Dutch churches had disbanded. But at the same time, wealthy Milwaukeeans were building summer homes in the lakeside community, which was easily accessible via the Lakeshore &amp; Western Railroad constructed in 1870 and later via the Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Company streetcars. In 1898, the Fox Point Club—the state&#x27;s second golf course—opened in the community, and attracted even more wealthy residents to the area, serving as a social center.

The rural Town of Milwaukee did not provide electricity, running water, sewage, or garbage collection, and by the 1920s, Fox Point&#x27;s increasingly wealthy residents wanted a higher standard of municipal service. Fox Point incorporated as a village in 1926, formed a school district in 1927, and began creating municipal parks, including Doctors Park on the Lake Michigan shore, which opened in 1930 and was transferred to the Milwaukee County parks system in 1937.

Although the late 1920s saw a short-lived building boom before the Great Depression, the population remained in the hundreds through World War II. But the village dramatically grew during the post-war boom with the population increasing from 1,180 in 1940 to 7,939 in 1970, a nearly seven-fold increase.

<text>Glendale is a city in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 13,357 at the 2020 census. A suburb north of Milwaukee, it is part of the Milwaukee metropolitan area.

==History==
The Glendale area has been inhabited for thousands of years. The earliest known inhabitants were Woodland period Mound Builders, who constructed earthen effigy and burial mounds in the area. Many of the mounds were destroyed by white farmers between 1850 and 1920, though some still exist in Kletzsch Park. In the early 19th century, the land was controlled by Native Americans, including the Menominee, Potawatomi, and Sauk people. The Menominee surrendered the land east of the Milwaukee River to the United States Federal Government through the Treaty of Washington in 1832. In 1833, the Potawatomi surrendered the land west of the river by signing the &quot;1833 Treaty of Chicago&quot;, which (after being ratified in 1835) required them to leave Wisconsin by 1838.

The land was organized as part of the Town of Milwaukee in 1838, and the first white settlers were farmers, many of whom were German immigrants. One center of settlement was the Good Hope community, which formed as a stagecoach stop on Green Bay Road in the late 1840s and was a prosperous rural community with a tavern, a school, and a railroad station into the 1890s.

Glendale incorporated as a city on December 28, 1950, from portions of the Town of Milwaukee, including a prosperous industrial corridor along Capitol Drive. It began to develop rapidly in the 1950s, reflecting post-World War II metropolitan growth and migration patterns throughout the United States. Bayshore Town Center (formerly called Bayshore Mall) was established on the eastern border of the city in 1954, and Cardinal Stritch University built a campus straddling the city and the neighboring Village of Fox Point in 1959. In the 1950s, the construction of Interstate 43 further contributed to the city&#x27;s rapid growth, and the population roughly tripled between 1950 and 1960.

Unlike other northshore suburbs of Milwaukee, Glendale has a mix of industry and commercial sites in addition to residential areas. The southern areas of the city have mainly industrial and higher density residential sites, while the north features medium to lower density residential plots. Interstate 43 divides the city into east and west sections. Nicolet High School is also located in Glendale and serves the city, along with the suburbs of Fox Point, Bayside, and River Hills. Glendale has begun an ambitious campaign to attract business and population growth. Major roads have undergone massive streetscaping projects, Bayshore Town Center has undergone a multimillion-dollar renovation, and the Glendale Business Park continues to welcome high tech clients. In June 2017, the Richard E. Maslowski Glendale Community Park was opened which includes an amphitheater, playground, veterans memorial, beer garden and community room.

The scene came into significant attention in Glendale on November 17, 2023, as four suspects, attempting to pull over to police, ran from their damaged SUV. One suspect rushed to a golf course, hiding inside a portable toilet until being trapped by golfers, in help of police.

==Geography==
Glendale is located at (43.130060, −87.927719).

<text>Greendale is a village in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 14,854 at the 2020 census. Greendale is located southwest of Milwaukee and is a part of the Milwaukee metropolitan area. A planned community, it was established by the US government during the Great Depression.

==History==
===Native American peoples===
The first recorded inhabitants of the Greendale area were various Native American tribes, including the Potawatomi. The 1833 Treaty of Chicago struck an agreement between the United States government that required the Chippewa, Odawa, and Potawatomi tribes to cede to the US government 5,000,000 acres (2,000,000 ha). In exchange for ceding their lands in the area, they were to receive monetary payments and lands west of the Mississippi in Indian Territory.

===1930s and beyond===
Greendale was one of three government-sponsored &quot;Greenbelt&quot; communities constructed by the Resettlement Administration, starting in 1936, as part of President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. The other Greenbelt communities were Greenbelt, Maryland and Greenhills, Ohio. Greendale was incorporated as a village on November 1, 1938. The planners and selection committees excluded African-American families from renting homes and created a racially segregated and all-white suburban community.

The original downtown area included the village hall, built in a Colonial Williamsburg style, 366 new homes comprising 572 living units, and several businesses. These homes were often referred to as &quot;Greendale Originals&quot;. The Greenbelt communities were patterned after the British garden city movement urban planning concept, built so residents could walk to schools, shops, and parks. Greendale was intended to be a model village for the working class. Income limits were from $1200 to $2700 per year, depending upon family size. In 1938, a one-bedroom Original rented for $19 a month. Rent for a four-bedroom home was $46 a month. Over 200 of the &quot;Originals&quot; have unique artistic designs on the chimneys.

Federal ownership of Greendale ended in 1953. In the late 1950s Greendale experienced growth in conjunction with the expansion of the Milwaukee suburbs as a whole. Although new homes were built and the number of minority families increased in Milwaukee County, racially restrictive covenants were used to maintain the all-white Greendale community. In 1958, the Crestview Acres land was sold by Elroy H. Barbian for development with the restrictive covenant that only white families could purchase the homes. &quot;No Persons other than the white race shall own or occupy any building on said tract, but this covenant shall not prevent occupancy of persons of a race other than the white race who are domestic servants of the owner or occupant of said building.&quot;

Southridge Mall opened in 1970 as the southern sister mall to Northridge Mall. Both malls were located on 76th Street, close to major east–west artery roads. Both were developed by Herb Kohl and Taubman Centers, Inc.

In 1996, the shopping district in the center of the village was purchased by the Grandhaven investment firm founded by Roy Reiman, founder of a publishing company headquartered in the village. The remake of the &quot;Village Center&quot; brought updates, attracted new restaurants, and made the village center more of a tourist attraction. More than 40,000 flowers are planted annually along the downtown streets in hanging baskets, sidewalk beds, and storefront window boxes.

To ease managing more than 2,000 men during Greendale&#x27;s construction, workers were directed to the &quot;A section&quot;, the &quot;B section&quot;, the &quot;C section&quot;, etc. This alphabetical reference has endured. Still today, all streets in each section begin with the same letter — the A section includes Angle Lane, Apricot Court, etc.

<text>Hales Corners is a village in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 7,720 at the 2020 census. A suburb of Milwaukee, it is part of the Milwaukee metropolitan area.

==History==
The land in the area that would eventually encompass the Village was first claimed as French, then British, and eventually as the Northwest Territory of the United States in 1783. It was the land of the Potawatomi Indians until they were forced to move from their land in 1838. They were the dominant tribe in southeast Wisconsin with large villages. Like the Europeans that arrived later, they planted crops, but theirs were beans, squash, and corn. By engaging in the fur trade, the Potawatomi learned to speak French and English, and they eventually intermarried with the Europeans. During the 1830s and 1840s, more settlers arrived, starting with a number of New England families. Among them were three Hale families, whose lineage has been charted to England in the 1200s. Hales Corners traces its history as a Village to 1837, when Seneca Hale laid claim to land here, and its name is credited to his brother William, who became its first Postmaster in 1854.
Hales Corners was the site of monthly fairs begun in the mid-1800s, when the plank road between Janesville and Milwaukee passed through the village. First a gathering of horse traders, the fairs became a stock market for farmers trading pigs, cattle, and sheep.

==Geography==
Hales Corners is located in southwestern Milwaukee County. It is bounded by Greenfield on the north, Greendale on the east, Franklin on the south, and New Berlin and Muskego in Waukesha County on the west.

<text>Oak Creek is a city in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. It sits on the southwestern shore of Lake Michigan and is located immediately south of Milwaukee. The population was 36,497 at the 2020 census. The city is one of the fastest growing in Milwaukee County and all of Wisconsin. The area has experienced an economic boom in recent years, with the addition of large companies such as Amazon, IKEA, and the Astronautics Corporation of America.

==History==
On January 2, 1838, the territorial legislature divided Milwaukee County into two towns: the Town of Milwaukee, encompassing everything north of the present Greenfield Avenue, and the Town of Lake encompassing everything south of the present Greenfield Avenue; &quot;and the polls of election shall be opened at the house of Elisha Higgins, in said town.&quot; On March 8, 1839, a new Town of Kinnikennick was created, encompassing the western part of Lake (later the Towns of Greenfield and Franklin); finally, on August 13, 1840, the south portion of the Town of Lake was split off to form the town of Oak Creek. As of the 1840 census, the population of the Town of Lake (then including Oak Creek) was 418.

In 1955, the Town of Oak Creek, then still semi-rural with a population of 4,807 in the 1950 census, was incorporated as a city under the terms of Wisconsin statute 66.0215, also known as &quot;The Oak Creek Law.&quot; The Oak Creek Law was crafted by Town Attorney Tony Basile to prevent Oak Creek&#x27;s annexation by the City of Milwaukee, which by annexations (including the 1954 annexation of the remainder of the Town of Lake) was now bordering Oak Creek and had already annexed one small portion of the town; the law was shepherded through the legislature with the help of state Democratic party legislative joint committee chairman Leland McParland, who was the state senator for Oak Creek.

In recent years, the 85 acre site called the Drexel Town Square, built on part of the site where the gigantic AC Spark Plug factory once stood, has become the city&#x27;s newest economic venture. It is home to a number of retail shops, restaurants, a hotel, residential buildings, and a medical facility. The Civic Center includes city hall and the public library. The town square also features a farmers market, splash pad, ice rink, and an outdoor amphitheater. The town square development won the 2016 Vision Award from the Milwaukee Business Journal.

On August 5, 2012, a white supremacist opened fire at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek. The white supremacist killed six people and injured several more before being killed by Oak Creek Police.

<text>River Hills is a village in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,602 at the 2020 census. A suburb of Milwaukee, it is part of the Milwaukee metropolitan area.

==History==
In the early 19th century, the River Hills area was controlled by Native Americans, including the Menominee, Potawatomi, and Sauk people. The Menominee surrendered the land east of the Milwaukee River to the United States Federal Government through the Treaty of Washington in 1832. In 1833, the Potawatomi surrendered the land west of the river by signing the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which (after being ratified in 1835) required them to leave Wisconsin by 1838. The land was organized as part of the Town of Milwaukee in 1835, and much of the land was bought by land speculators, who cleared the old-growth forests for timber. The first permanent white settlers were Joel and Cephas Buttles. The latter owned 160 acres in River Hills and built a cabin in 1843. In the mid-1840s, many families of Dutch settlers began arriving in the Town of Milwaukee to farm the land, but by the 1870s most of the residents were German farmers. The community was primarily agricultural until the 1920s.

In 1911, the Milwaukee Country Club relocated from Shorewood to a site on the western bank of the Milwaukee River in present-day River Hills. The club includes a golf course, and also organized polo matches fox hunts as late as the 1960s. In the 1920s, many wealthy Milwaukee families built summer estates on multi-acre plots near the county club, which served as the community&#x27;s social center. The wealthy residents were often at odds with the neighboring farms of the Town of Milwaukee, and in 1930 they incorporated River Hills as a village with carefully crafted zoning laws, requiring that houses be built on lots at least one acre in size and banning commercial and industrial from the municipal boundaries. River Hills is the only community in Milwaukee County that is zoned one-hundred percent residential, and eighty-five percent of residential lots are over five acres. The only properties that are not private residences are the country club, the Lynden Sculpture Garden, several churches and synagogues, a public elementary school, and the campus of the private University School of Milwaukee. From 1956 until 1971, the village was also home to a Nike missile silo.

==Geography==
River Hills is located at (43.165142, -87.932566).

<text>Shorewood is a village in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. A suburb of Milwaukee, it is part of the Milwaukee metropolitan area. The population was 13,859 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In the early 19th century when the first white settlers arrived, the Shorewood area was controlled by Native Americans, including the Menominee, Potawatomi, and Sauk people. The United States Federal Government traded the land from the Menominee people in 1832 through the &quot;Treaty of Washington&quot;.

The land was organized as part of the Town of Milwaukee in 1835, and when settlers arrived in the mid-1830s, they found the area to be heavily forested. They built two sawmills on the east bank of the Milwaukee River, and the unincorporated community around the sawmills was known as Mechanicsville. However, the mills&#x27; success was short-lived; both closed during the Panic of 1837. Thomas Bare, the area&#x27;s first permanent white settler, arrived in 1841 and purchased ninety acres of farmland east of the Milwaukee River. Around 1850, another unincorporated community known as Humboldt was settled in the area. Humboldt&#x27;s industrial base included a paper mill and a grist mill.

Beginning in the 1870s, the area&#x27;s economy began to diversify. In 1873, the Northwestern Union Railway laid tracks through present-day Shorewood along the eastern bank of the Milwaukee River. The railroad was a boon for local businesses, including the Milwaukee Cement Company, which began quarrying limestone on the bluffs above the river in 1876. The community that grew around the company was known as Cementville and prospered until quarrying operations ceased in 1909.

In 1872, a resort called Lueddemann&#x27;s-on-the-River opened in the southwestern part of present-day Shorewood. Accessible by riverboat and later by train, the resort was the first of several beer gardens and amusement parks that operated in the area between the 1872 and 1916. Coney Island, an amusement park that opened in 1900, proved to be particularly controversial and played a significant role in Shorewood&#x27;s incorporation as a village. The park included loud music, electric lights, and a roller coaster. Some town residents were opposed to the noise, light pollution, and raucous visitors coming from the City of Milwaukee on the newly constructed Milwaukee Electric Railway streetcar lines. Some blamed the Town of Milwaukee, which collected licensing fees from the park and allowed it to operate. Additionally, the roads in the community were of poor quality compared with those in the neighboring city of Milwaukee, and residents were unhappy that tax revenue from the increasingly suburban Shorewood area—including the taxes from Coney Island—were being redistributed across the town rather than being used to increase their standard of living. In response, residents voted to incorporate as the Village of East Milwaukee. At the time of incorporation in August 1900, the village had a population of 300.

In the early 1900s, the village developed as a streetcar suburb of Milwaukee, with public transportation allowing residents to easily commute to the city. The village&#x27;s center emerged along the streetcar lines on Oakland Avenue and Atwater Road (now known as Capitol Drive). Additionally, affluent Milwaukeeans began building mansions in the eastern part of the village along Lake Drive and the bluff overlooking Lake Michigan. The population grew to 1,255 by 1913, and in the 1910s municipal improvements included paved roads and sidewalks, gas mains, and street signs. The Village of East Milwaukee changed its name to the Village of Shorewood in 1917.

Shorewood saw significant growth in the 1920s, with the population quadrupling from 2,650 residents in 1920 to 13,479 in 1930. During the decade, as many as 200 new homes were constructed per year in the village, including work by Alexander C. Eschweiler and Flagg-system homes constructed by Arnold F. Meyer &amp; Co. The architect Russell Barr Williamson, who worked for Frank Lloyd Wright from 1914 to 1917, designed at least 16 homes in Shorewood between 1918 and 1929. As the village population swelled, local municipal institutions became more organized. The village&#x27;s health department organized in 1918; the police department, in 1920; and the fire department, in 1929. In 1928, the village&#x27;s elected board of trustees hired a full-time village manager to head the village&#x27;s day-to-day operations, and Shorewood has had a council–manager government ever since. Shorewood&#x27;s school district also grew in the 1920s and was influenced by the ideas of philosopher John Dewey.

The village&#x27;s historical population reached its zenith after World War II, with over 16,000 residents. The community underwent urban renewal projects beginning in the 1960s, but the population has slowly declined to approximately 13,000 as of 2010.

==Geography==

Shorewood is located at (43.092061, −87.886333).

Nestled between the Milwaukee River and Lake Michigan, Shorewood is bordered by the City of Milwaukee to the south and west and Whitefish Bay to the north. According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all of it land.

Shorewood&#x27;s border to the west stops at the Milwaukee River&#x27;s edge according to the Village Charter, unlike most river municipal boundaries that are set at the middle of the river.

<text>St. Francis is a city in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 9,161 at the 2020 census. A suburb of Milwaukee along Lake Michigan, it is part of the Milwaukee metropolitan area.

==History==
The area that is now St. Francis was known as &quot;Nojoshing&quot; by local Native Americans at the time that the first white settlers arrived. St. Francis Seminary was established in what is now the city in 1845. The Sisters of St. Francis of Assisi settled there in the mid-19th century.

Historically, what is now the city of St. Francis was part of the Town of Lake. As large parts of the Town of Lake were gradually being annexed into the city of Milwaukee, residents in the St. Francis area sought to incorporate their community to prevent this from happening to them. A movement to split St. Francis off from the rest of the Town of Lake as a city existed as early as the 1920s, but faced resistance from residents of the rest of the town. Ultimately, the residents successfully voted to incorporate on July 24, 1951, and the result was certified the next day. The rest of the Town of Lake was annexed into Milwaukee in 1954.

The city took its name from Saint Francis de Sales Seminary, founded by Archbishop John Henni, the first Archbishop of Milwaukee, who placed it under the patronage of Francis de Sales, the first Catholic bishop of Switzerland after the Swiss Reformation.

<text>Wauwatosa ( ; colloquially Tosa) is a city in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 48,387 at the 2020 census. Wauwatosa is a suburb located immediately west of Milwaukee and is part of the Milwaukee metropolitan area. It is named after the Potawatomi Chief Wauwataesie and the Potawatomi word for firefly.

==History==
The lush Menomonee Valley of the Wauwatosa area provided a key overland gateway between the rich glacial farmland of southeastern Wisconsin and the Port of Milwaukee. In 1835, Charles Hart became the first Euro-American to settle here, followed that year by 17 other families. The following year a United States Road was built from Milwaukee through Wauwatosa, eventually reaching Madison. Charles Hart built a mill in 1845 on the Menomonee River which gave the settlement its original name of &quot;Hart&#x27;s Mill.&quot; The mill was torn down in 1914.

The Town of Wau-wau-too-sa was created by act of the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature on April 30, 1840. As of the 1840 census, the population of the Town of Wau-wau-too-sa or Wauwatosa was 342. The town government was organized in 1842. The town&#x27;s borders originally extended from the present-day Greenfield Avenue in the south to Hampton Avenue in the north, and from 27th Street in the east to the Waukesha County line in the west, encompassing sections of present-day Milwaukee, West Milwaukee and West Allis, plus the southern part of former North Milwaukee, which was wholly annexed into the city of Milwaukee in 1927. Most of the town was farmland through the remainder of the 19th century.

In 1849 the Watertown Plank Road was constructed through Wauwatosa, mainly following the old Madison territorial road. In 1851 Wisconsin&#x27;s first railroad (later The Milwaukee Road) established Wauwatosa as its western terminus. The Village of Wauwatosa was incorporated from the central part of the Town of Wauwatosa in 1892, and was rechartered as the City of Wauwatosa on May 27, 1897.

===Expansion ===
On November 25, 1952, the City of Wauwatosa more than doubled its size by annexing of land west of the Menomonee River, the entire remaining portion of the Town of Wauwatosa, which became the home to several large cold storage and regional food distribution terminals. Industrial plants owned by firms including Harley-Davidson and Briggs &amp; Stratton were also constructed.

In the past 40 years, western Wauwatosa has become an edge city with an important commercial and retail district built up along Milwaukee&#x27;s beltline Highway 100 and anchored by the Mayfair Mall.

===Removal of cross===
In 1992, Wauwatosa received some national attention when the Wauwatosa Common Council, threatened with a lawsuit, decided to remove a Christian cross from the City&#x27;s seal that had been adopted in 1957. The cross was replaced with the text &quot;In God We Trust&quot;.

The seal itself had originally been designed by 9-year old Suzanne Vallier as an entry in a contest among Wauwatosa schoolchildren. The quadrants of the logo&#x27;s shield represented, from top left going clockwise: an arrowhead representing the Indians who were the original inhabitants of the city; the mill representing Hart&#x27;s Mill which was the original name of the city; the cross representing the &quot;city of churches&quot;; and the symbol used on street signs representing the &quot;city of homes&quot;.

===2020 shootings===

On February 2, 2020, Alvin Cole, a 17-year-old African-American male, was shot and killed at Mayfair Mall by a police officer responding to a reported disturbance. According to authorities, Cole had been fleeing from police while carrying a stolen handgun. No charges were filed against the officer who fired the fatal shots, sparking protests.

On November 20, a shooting occurred at the mall, leaving eight people injured. The shooter fled the scene afterwards and remained at large for a day, until the arrest of a 15-year-old suspect.

==Geography==

Eastern Wauwatosa is also known for its homes and residential streets, at one time just a short streetcar ride away from downtown Milwaukee. Prior to the arrival of Dutch elm disease, many of Wauwatosa&#x27;s older residential streets had large gothic colonnades of American Elm trees. In Wauwatosa, the Menomonee Valley made it easier to quarry portions of the Niagara Escarpment, which provided the necessary materials for cream-colored bricks and limestone foundations used in many homes and public buildings throughout the region.

==In popular culture==
Wauwatosa is the home town of the narrator of an unrecorded song by Bob Dylan, &quot;On, Wisconsin&quot; (not to be confused with the University of Wisconsin fight song of the same name). The lyrics were written by Dylan in 1961, but the song remained unfinished until 2018, when local musician Trapper Schoepp wrote music to accompany Dylan&#x27;s lyrics. Schoepp recorded the song at Wauwatosa&#x27;s Wire &amp; Vice studio for his album &quot;Primetime Illusion&quot; (2019).

An episode of the police procedural television show &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, entitled &quot;In Name and Blood&quot; (S03 E02), was set in Wauwatosa.

<text>West Allis is a city in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. A suburb of Milwaukee, it is part of the Milwaukee metropolitan area. The population was 60,325 at the 2020 census, making it the eleventh-most populous city in Wisconsin.

==History==
The name West Allis derives from Edward P. Allis, whose Edward P. Allis Company was a large Milwaukee-area manufacturing firm in the late 19th century. In 1901, the Allis company became Allis-Chalmers. In 1902, the company built a large new manufacturing plant west of its existing plant. The locale in which the new plant was constructed was at the time called North Greenfield; prior to the 1880s, the area had been called Honey Creek. With the building of the western Allis plant, the area was incorporated as the Village of West Allis, and it became the City of West Allis in 1906.

With the presence of Allis-Chalmers, the largest manufacturer in the area, West Allis became the largest suburb of Milwaukee in the early 20th century. After that, West Allis grew quickly.

<text>Whitefish Bay is a village in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 14,954 at the 2020 census. A suburb north of Milwaukee along the shore of Lake Michigan, it is part of the Milwaukee metropolitan area.

==History==
In the early 19th century when the first white settlers arrived, the Whitefish Bay area was controlled by Native Americans, including the Menominee, Potawatomi, and Sauk people. The area came under the control of the United States Federal Government in 1832 when the Menominee surrendered their claims to the land by signing the &quot;Treaty of Washington&quot;. The land was organized as part of the Town of Milwaukee in 1835, and for much of the 19th century, the community&#x27;s main economic activities were farming and fishing. Many of the early settlers were German immigrants.

In 1889, Pabst Brewing Company-owner Frederick Pabst purchased land in the Whitefish Bay area which he developed into the Whitefish Bay Pabst Resort, which included a hotel, restaurant, beer garden, and bandshell. He later added a Ferris wheel and a carousel, as well. At its height, the park hosted as many as 15,000 visitors each weekend, and was once visited by President Theodore Roosevelt. Some leisure seekers travelled to the park from Milwaukee via steam boats that docked at Whitefish Bay&#x27;s lakeshore; others took the Milwaukee &amp; Whitefish Bay Railroad, a steam-powered tram that began running to Whitefish Bay in 1886 and was replaced by the electric streetcars of the Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Company in 1898.

In the early 1890s, the area&#x27;s residents lobbied the Town of Milwaukee for a local school; the nearest school was seven miles from Whitefish Bay. The town did not acquiesce to the residents&#x27; demands, and in 1892, the local residents responded by incorporating as the Village of Whitefish Bay and forming a school district independent of the Town of Milwaukee. At the time, it was the first village in Milwaukee County.

In the early 20th century, the village developed as a streetcar suburb, with the population growing from 512 in 1900 to 9651 in 1940. As the population grew, real estate developers constructed new residential subdivisions. Even though the Whitefish Bay Pabst Resort closed in 1914, the lakeshore land it occupied was redeveloped into seventeen lakefront residential lots, including the National Register of Historic Places-listed Herman Uihlein Mansion, constructed between 1917 and 1919 for one of the sons of the president of the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company. In the first decades of the 1900s, eastern Whitefish Bay became part of the &quot;gold coast&quot; area that developed along the lakeshore north of Milwaukee and attracted some of the city&#x27;s most affluent families.

Whitefish Bay continued to grow during the suburbanization that followed World War II, reaching a peak population of 18,390 in 1960, before the population began to slowly decline, stabilizing at approximately 14,000 at the turn of the 21st century.

<text>Wyeville is a village in Monroe County, Wisconsin, United States. It is located on Wisconsin Highway 21. The population was 147 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The West Wisconsin Railway was authorized in 1876 to build from St. Paul, Minnesota through to reach the Chicago and North Western Railway at Elroy, Wisconsin. This railroad became the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway (&quot;The Omaha Road&quot;) in 1880. At this location, a branch rail line was constructed eastward to Necedah. The location originally was named &quot;Necedah Junction&quot;. The local post office was called Wyeville when established in 1890 and the first postmaster was Charles Brooks. The name Wyeville is documented as a variation of &quot;Wythe&quot;, a county in Virginia. Eventually the name &quot;Necedah Junction&quot; was dropped in 1911 and the community was called the same name as the post office.

The railway junction became a crossing in 1911 for the lines of the Chicago and North Western Railway and its Omaha Road subsidiary. The Milwaukee, Sparta, and Northwestern Railroad, a subsidiary of the Chicago and North Western Railway, began the &quot;Air Line&quot; or &quot;Adams Cutoff&quot; from Adams, Wisconsin towards Sparta, Wisconsin in 1910. This railroad used the line from Necedah to Wyeville as part of this new route. A true railroad wye was built at the railroad crossover, along with an interlocking tower and railroad depot.

Until 1963, passengers of Twin Cities 400 and the Rochester 400 changed trains there, as it was a scheduled transfer point for the two streamliners.

==Economy==
For many years the primary industry of Lakewood was timber, but in recent decades this has changed to the service industry. Most of the local revenue is generated by the tourist trade. The Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, which surrounds the area, is a working forest that has been clear-cut in the past and cut-over many times. As recently as the 1950s the Lakewood area was known for its virgin timber and pristine nature, but aggressive logging and clear-cutting significantly changed the face of the area. The Holt and Balcolm logging company set aside one tract of land in which they did not cut the original growth. This area, called the &quot;Cathedral of Pines&quot;, was preserved as a result of the efforts of Lucy Rumsey Holt who influenced her husband, logger W. A. Holt, to leave it as virgin timber. Mrs. Holt used this area to teach Bible studies to her children and did not want the area disturbed. This 200- to 400-year-old white pine and balsam old growth stand is also home to a great blue heron rookery.

McCaslin Brook (also spelled McCauslin) was used as a means of transporting large quantities of logs to saw-mills or for transportation to major cities where the timber was sold. The oldest logging camp in the United States can be found on what is now the McCaslin Brook Golf Course.

Today the Lakewood area serves as a get-away for visitors from the Green Bay, Appleton, and many other areas. Water skiing, tubing, canoeing, and fishing are area activities.

==YMCA Camp==
The YMCA camp Nan A Bo Sho, an overnight camp in Lakewood owned by the YMCA Fox Cities of Appleton, has been in operation since 1964. Here campers learn sailing, arts and crafts, an engage in other outdoor activities. It is a popular summer getaway located on Waubee lake.
