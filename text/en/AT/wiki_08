<text>Christiansburg (formerly Hans Meadows) is a town in the southwestern portion of Montgomery County, Virginia. It has served as the seat of government for the county since 1792, when it was formally recognized by the Virginia General Assembly. Christiansburg is contiguously bordered on its north by the only other incorporated town in Montgomery County, Blacksburg. Christiansburg (and Blacksburg) are situated on the Eastern Continental Divide in the Appalachian Mountains. 

The economy of Christiansburg and Blacksburg are dominated by the presence of Virginia Tech (located inside the town of Blacksburg) by far the largest employer in the county. 

Christiansburg&#x27;s population was 23,348 at the 2020 census, up from 21,041 at the 2010 census. Christiansburg and Blacksburg are the principal municipalities of the Blacksburg–Christiansburg metropolitan area which also encompasses the city of Radford, the unincorporated areas of Montgomery County, plus all of Giles and Pulaski Counties. The 2020 census recorded that the population of the Blacksburg-Christiansburg metropolitan area was 181,854, ranked 238th of the 387 uniquely defined metropolitan areas in the United States. 

==History==

=== European discovery, founding (1671–1792) ===
In 1671 Abraham Wood commissioned the first English expedition to cross the Eastern Continental Divide. The members of that expedition included Thomas Wood, Thomas Batts (Batte) and Robert Fallamto. The expedition is now known as the Batts and Fallam Expedition. The exploration party reached what is now the New River Valley and the New River. The site of discovery of the northerly-running river is believed to be where the Little River enters the New River just north of what is now the Claytor Lake Dam. This is about 10 miles from the center of Christiansburg. 

Along the river, there were several Native American encampments, and conflicts were common between those tribes and the early settlers. As settlers began moving into present-day Christiansburg, they discovered that area was also inhabited by the Shawnee and other Native American tribes, who had discovered the river some years prior.

In the late 1600s, Dutch priest Friar Hans arrived in the region; it was named Hans Meadow after him in the early 1700s.

In the 18th century, the region was settled by pioneers from Pennsylvania and eastern Virginia. In 1776, Montgomery County was formed from part of Fincastle County. The City of Radford, as well as parts of Floyd, Giles and Pulaski counties, were all subsequently formed from Montgomery County land.

The town of &quot;Christiansburgh&quot; – as it was originally spelled – was named in honor of Colonel William Christian, who was an early settler in the region. He was one of the first justices of Fincastle County, a member of the Virginia Legislature, and brother-in-law of Patrick Henry. Theodore Roosevelt, in his history &quot;The Winning of the West,&quot; later wrote that Colonel Christian was a &quot;noted Indian fighter&quot; and a &quot;very gallant and honorable man.&quot;

Developing from a concentration of taverns and rest stops along the Great Wagon Road (present-day U.S. Route 11), the original 1.1-square mile town was established on November 10, 1792, by an act passed by the Virginia General Assembly. The town of Christiansburg was later incorporated on January 7, 1833.

=== Notable early settlers ===
George Washington was known to have visited Christiansburg during the early years of settlement.

Frontiersman Daniel Boone resided in town for a time. Among records in the County Courthouse is a warrant dated 1774 for the arrest of Boone on a debt charge. The warrant was issued under King George&#x27;s name but marked &quot;Not executed – Gone to Kentucky.&quot; Boone later repaid the debt.

Davy Crockett lived in Christiansburg and served as an apprentice to a local newspaper printer for a short time. Crockett also worked at John Snider&#x27;s Hattery Shop, located on W. Main Street, for 18 months.

William Clark, of the famous Lewis and Clark Expedition, resided in Christiansburg. He lived in downtown Christiansburg in the existing house at 109 E. Main Street, which is commonly known as the Montague home. Meriwether Lewis also visited Christiansburg on occasion.

=== Early years (1793–1860) ===
Christiansburg experienced significant growth in the early 1800s, and by 1840, the population had grown to 400.

Most residential growth was confined to Main Street and Cross Street (now Franklin Street). Several industrial complexes developed around the Gardner Zink Mill west of town and the Chrisman Mill along Crab Creek (on what is now State Route 661/Chrisman Mill Road). These two mills were responsible for the centralization of a number of area milling operations in the late 1700s.

New streets were laid out during the early 1800s, and additional construction included a number of churches and a public well and pumps, which were placed just north of the Courthouse in 1826. Ten years later, a public privy was built near the public square, and a new courthouse was constructed in March 1836 in the east corner of the public square. The Christiansburg (Cambria) Depot in the community of Cambria was established on the Virginia Tennessee Railroad line in 1854.

Downtown Christiansburg was the site of the Lewis-McHenry Duel on May 9, 1808. The rifle duel between Thomas Lewis and John McHenry, which killed both men, led to the passage of the Barbour Bill in 1810, outlawing dueling in Virginia. Former town resident Dr. John Floyd was the attending surgeon at the Lewis-McHenry duel and later governor of Virginia, as well as a member of Congress. He was also the father of John Buchanan Floyd, who served as governor of Virginia from 1849 to 1852.

Pennsylvanian artist Lewis Miller was fascinated with Montgomery County&#x27;s scenery, and throughout the 1830s through the 1850s, he often stayed in Christiansburg to depict town scenes. After the Civil War, Miller retired to Christiansburg and spent his last 20 years living with relatives and friends. The Montgomery Museum and Lewis Miller Regional Art Center, located at 300 Pepper Street SE, is named for him.

=== Civil War through late 19th century (1861–1899) ===
During the Civil War, many men from the Christiansburg area served in the Confederate army in the Shenandoah Valley under General T.J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson . Christiansburg was invaded several times by Union Forces operating under W.W. Averell, and in 1864, the Union Army burned all of the Christiansburg Depot structures except the passenger station.

Confederate forces were active within the Christiansburg area and occupied a number of buildings in and around the town. The Lattimer Plantation, which once stood on the Christiansburg High School site, was used as a Confederate headquarters. The nearby Montgomery White Sulphur Springs resort in Ellett Valley was utilized as a hospital from 1861 to 1865.

Near the end of the war, Union General George B. Stoneman and his men were in Christiansburg and had established headquarters in the Rice D. Montague home, which still stands at 109 E. Main Street. His men were stationed there when news came of Confederate General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s surrender at Appomattox.

Following the Civil War, the population of Christiansburg experienced a decline that continued throughout the 19th century. In 1870, there were 864 people in the town, and by 1900, there were only 659.

=== Christiansburg Institute ===
Captain Charles S. Schaeffer, an agent of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, founded the Christiansburg Normal Institute (renamed the Christiansburg Industrial Institute) in 1866. The school was formed as a private primary school for the education of black children and was located on Zion Hill, between the town and the old Christiansburg (Cambria) Depot.

Booker T. Washington served as superintendent of the institute from 1896 until his death in 1915 and was instrumental in expanding the curriculum to include both classical instruction and practical instruction in industry and the trades. The school was relocated to Lattimer Plantation in 1898 and was significantly expanded in the following years, growing to 14 buildings and 185 acres. George Washington Carver and other members of the Tuskegee University staff visited CII, and prominent industrial engineer John Wines Lester lived on the CII campus.

The Institute came under lease by the Montgomery County School System in 1935. The property was transferred to Montgomery County Schools in 1947, establishing it as a full-fledged public school. The Christiansburg Institute was the first black high school in southwestern Virginia and was also the first high school in Montgomery County to receive accreditation with the Virginia Public School System. It remained in operation as a segregated high school until 1966 when desegregation brought its closure.

=== Early 20th century (1900–1945) ===
By the early 1900s, Christiansburg had taken on many of the functions of a regional center, with a bank, newspaper, Temperance Hall and photographer. Telephone service was provided by the Montgomery Intelligence Company, which was incorporated in 1886. Agriculture played an important part in the local and regional economy, and livestock were regularly driven to market down Main Street or taken to the Christiansburg Depot.

A fire following a temperance march in 1900 destroyed several buildings along West Main Street in the downtown area. Despite this fire, Christiansburg experienced vigorous growth in the first decade of the 20th century, growing from 659 persons in 1900 to 1,568 in 1910. The success of the Norfolk and Western Railroad&#x27;s Christiansburg Depot, which served as the main shipping point for much of Montgomery County, contributed to much of this growth. Several new houses were built between the town center and the Depot, and the Depot area community was eventually incorporated as the town of Cambria in 1906.

The completion of U.S. Route 11 – the first interstate highway in America – was celebrated in Christiansburg when the last link passing through downtown was hard surfaced in 1926. By 1929, Virginia Polytechnic Institute was providing employment for the area&#x27;s citizens through academic positions and mining jobs related to the school&#x27;s coal-operated power plant.

The depression years were notable for Christiansburg for an unusual reason: Christiansburg&#x27;s Post Office was one of approximately two dozen locations in Virginia to receive Mural American Artwork or sculptures, which were created through Roosevelt&#x27;s Works Project Administration. Christiansburg&#x27;s mural is entitled Great Road and was completed in 1938 by John DeGroot.

=== Post–World War II (1946–1965) ===
Following World War II, Christiansburg rapidly industrialized. The Southern Dairies Plant (which later became a part of Sealtest) opened, and The Roberts&#x27; Motel – the first of its kind in Southwestern Virginia – also debuted after the war. Virginia Tech continued to expand, and by the mid-1950s, the school owned 2,000 acres in Montgomery County and employed more than 1,400 individuals. In 1953, the Starlite Drive-In opened and continues to operate as one of the few remaining drive-in theatres in the United States.

The 1950s were most noted for the number of devastating fires that occurred in town. In 1954, Roses&#x27; 5&amp;10 and Cavalier Furniture were both destroyed. Catastrophe struck again in 1956, destroying most of the businesses on East Main Street. In a single fire, the town lost the City Market, Royal Cafe, Smith &amp; Jones, Jennings Barber Shop and Interiors by Richard. Fires in 1957 claimed Simmons Shoe Shop, the Blue Moon Lunch and the rebuilt Jennings Barber Shop. A major fire on Main Street (now Cambria Street, N.E.) in Cambria in 1959 destroyed many of the oldest and most historic buildings there.

Having lost most of its taxpaying enterprises and faced with failing utilities, the town of Cambria proposed and was accepted for consolidation with the Town of Christiansburg on December 31, 1965.

=== Modernization (1966–present) ===
The town of Christiansburg continued to grow in the 1970s and 1980s, and two annexations added approximately 3,799 residents. A 1988 annexation incorporated Belmont Farms, the New River Valley Mall (which was under construction on the effective date), what had been the Virginia Tech Horticulture Farm (on the northern end of town) and the top of Christiansburg Mountain (on the eastern end of town).

The town underwent two boundary adjustments in the 1990s, which incorporated the Falling Branch Industrial Park and a portion of the Marketplace shopping center and the Christiansburg Industrial Park.

In 2000, the Spradlin Farms area began development, providing an additional retail space to the town. In 2002, a large portion of both Blacksburg and Christiansburg, as well as a portion of Montgomery County, were designated as a part of an &quot;urbanized area&quot; based upon 2000 Census figures.

In 2007, the New River Center was constructed just north of the New River Valley Mall, which added another large retail development to the town. Also in 2007, the town of Christiansburg and Montgomery County agreed to an adjustment, which brought 49.816 acres and approximately 66 persons into Town (with one single-family house and Wheatland Retirement Community accounting for the population). In a 2009 boundary adjustment, the town added the area of the Christiansburg Middle School, Harkrader Sports Complex and former Harkrader Farm, which brought in 170.318 acres and approximately six residents.

A &quot;friendly sign war&quot; between local businesses in the community went viral in 2021.

<text>Elliston-Lafayette was a census-designated place (CDP) in Montgomery County, Virginia, United States. The population was 1,241 at the 2000 census; in 2010, Elliston and Lafayette were split into separate CDPs. It is part of the Blacksburg–Christiansburg Metropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses all of Montgomery County, Virginia, including the towns of Blacksburg and Christiansburg, and the city of Radford. However, many residents of the eastern section of Montgomery County more often travel to Roanoke or Salem for work, shopping, and services since these cities are generally closer and do not require driving up Christiansburg Mountain on U.S. Route 460 (which is a concurrency with U.S. Route 11 here) or Interstate 81.

Elliston and Lafayette are also considered distinct communities by most local residents. Lafayette is located along the Roanoke River just across the Roanoke County line. The north fork and south fork of the river join near Interstate 81 north of Lafayette. While Lafayette is named for the Marquis de Lafayette, it is pronounced &quot;Luh-fett&quot; or &quot;Luh-fay-ett&quot;. The center of Elliston, which is the larger community, is approximately three miles west of Lafayette on US 460.

Shawsville is approximately four miles west of Elliston. The majority of US 460 between the communities is a completely straight stretch of road, which is not common in this area of Virginia, known locally as the Elliston Straightaway. During the 1990s, there was some minor controversy between Elliston and Shawsville about how far down the Elliston Straightaway would be the appropriate place for a &quot;Welcome to Shawsville&quot; sign. Additionally, Shawsville Elementary School also resides in 24087, the Elliston ZIP Code.

<text>Cape Charles is a town / municipal corporation in Northampton County, Virginia, United States. The population was 1,178 as of the 2020 Census.

==History==
Cape Charles, located close to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, on Virginia&#x27;s Eastern Shore, was founded in 1884 as a planned community by railroad and ferry interests. In 1883, William Lawrence Scott became president of the New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk Railroad Company (NYP&amp;N), and purchased three plantations comprising approximately 2,509 acres from the heirs of former Virginia Governor Littleton Waller Tazewell. Of this land, 40 acres were ceded to the NYP&amp;N, and 136 acres went to create the Town of Cape Charles (technically known as the &quot;Municipal Corporation of Cape Charles&quot;). Some of this land, named Cape Charles for the geographical cape found on the Point and headland to the south, Scott sold to the Railroad Company to serve as the southern terminus of the line on the Delmarva Peninsula from the Northeast states. In that same year, construction of the railroad began. In Cape Charles, the Railroad Company built a harbor port to handle steamships and freighters from Cape Charles to Norfolk.

The original Town was surveyed, platted, and laid out with approximately 136 acres divided into 644 equal lots. Seven wider avenues which run from east to west were named for Virginia statesmen and political leaders; the streets which run north and south were named for fruits. The original layout of the Town is still very visible today, and was inspired by the layout of Erie, Pennsylvania, a city in which Scott was formerly mayor.

Historian William G. Thomas writes, &quot;At a cost of nearly $300,000, the New York, Pennsylvania, and Norfolk Railroad (N.Y.P. &amp; N. R.R.) was dredging a new harbor out of a large fresh-water lagoon between King&#x27;s and Old Plantation creeks in lower Northampton County, and Scott planned to develop a new town around it called Cape Charles City. The appellation &quot;City&quot; for any place on the Eastern Shore was romantic, a vision of the future that the railroad might make possible...In 1890, the United States Army Corps of Engineers dredged the harbor basin, its entrance, and a channel through Cherrystone Inlet and built stone jetties protecting the harbor outlet. By 1912 the Engineer Corps estimated that Cape Charles harbor handled 2,500,000 tons of freight a year.&quot;
Cape Charles was, for many years, the terminal for the Little Creek-Cape Charles Ferry, providing passenger and car ferry service across the mouth of the Bay to Norfolk Portsmouth, Virginia Beach and Chesapeake on the SouthSide / Tidewater and across Hampton Roads harbor to Hampton - Newport News on the northern Virginia Peninsula. The last ferry left Cape Charles in 1963. Cape Charles served as a terminal for railway freight barges that carried rail cars from the former Eastern Shore Railroad which later became Bay Coast Railroad across the mouth of the Bay to Norfolk. The Bay Coast Railroad ceased operations in 2018. There is also a cement factory nearby.

The town hosted the Northampton Red Sox in the old Eastern Shore Baseball League.

The Cape Charles Historic District and Stratton Manor are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Cape Charles is located at (37.267522, −76.014125).

Cape Charles lies on a peninsula and is surrounded by water on three sides. The town is situated directly on the Chesapeake Bay, bordered by King&#x27;s Creek to the north and Old Plantation Creek to the south. The land in town is low lying and relatively flat, with the highest point of elevation at 15 feet, and a slope of less than 1%. Most of the developed land in town is between 5 and 10 feet in elevation.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 4.4 square miles (11.3 km2), of which, 3.7 square miles (9.5 km2) of it is land and 0.7 square miles (1.8 km2) of it (16.06%) is water.

The Chesapeake Bay impact crater formed about 35 million years ago during the late Eocene when a comet fragment or asteroid struck the U.S. Atlantic continental shelf in the area now occupied by the southern part of Chesapeake Bay and adjacent landmasses in the Virginia Coastal Plain. The resulting structure is an approximately circular, 53-mile-diameter crater centered near the town of Cape Charles.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Cape Charles features a humid subtropical climate with hot, humid summers and chilly, but not very cold winters. Temperatures routinely exceed 90 °F in the summer and typically dip below the freezing point during the winter, though it is somewhat rare for temperatures to dip far below freezing. Cape Charles on average receives roughly 45 inches of precipitation annually. Cape Charles receives 2300 hours of sunshine annually (higher than the USA average). 
==Transportation==
===Major highways===

===Public transportation===
STAR Transit provides public transit services to Cape Charles.

==Recreation==
The town owns one of two public beaches on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, and the only public beach on the bayside of the Eastern Shore. The beach extends one-half mile along Bay Avenue with a paved walkway bordering the length of the beachfront. Residents and visitors of the town use the beach for swimming, sunbathing, and similar recreational pursuits. Public access onto the beachfront is provided by two wooden walkovers located near the end of Tazewell and Randolph Avenues, as well as the town&#x27;s Fun Pier which also has a wooden walkover. The beach is stabilized with buried groins and a bulkhead. In 1987 the Army Corps of Engineers dredged the harbor and channel and deposited the sand along the beach area, which greatly expanded the width of the beach and improved the quality of sand along the beachfront. Beach erosion is an ongoing problem and will require sand replenishment on a periodic basis in order to maintain a sandy beachfront.

Adjacent to the public beach is a municipal pier which extends across the stone jetty at the entrance of the harbor. The wooden pier, which is known as the Fun Pier, has a railed siding and several built-in benches, and is frequently utilized by Town residents and visitors for sightseeing. Cape Charles is also home to one of six public boat ramp sites in Northampton County, and one of only three sites on the County&#x27;s Bayside.

The nearby 29-acre Cape Charles Natural Area Preserve, owned by Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation, has a long boardwalk that traverses several natural communities, including a Maritime Loblolly Pine Forest, and ends at a low bluff overlooking the Chesapeake Bay. The preserve provides habitat for the federally threatened northeastern beach tiger beetle and is part of the Lower Delmarva Important Bird Area. During fall bird migration, the forest abounds with migratory songbirds and raptors resting and feeding before continuing their journey across the Chesapeake Bay.

==Industry==
The Cape Charles Harbor serves local industry and commerce operations as well as tourists and recreational users. The harbor was originally developed to load and unload railroad cars on barges. The harbor includes extensive bulkheading, as well as commercial docking facilities for industrial uses. The Industrial land use in the Town is concentrated at the Cape Charles Harbor area, and includes the Eastern Shore Railroad, Bayshore Concrete, the commercial dock and the Sustainable Technology Park.

== History ==

The present town of Eastville is situated near the sites of the first European settlements established on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. In 1620, Thomas Savage, having been trained as an interpreter and working with the Virginia Company to secure land on the shore from the indigenous cultures there, settled on land that in time came to be known as “Savage Neck,” a few miles southwest of Eastville. By the last quarter of the 17th century, Henry Matthews had settled on the tract of land covering the present town. In 1677, Northampton County residents petitioned for the county court to be moved to a more central location, suggesting Matthew&#x27;s home. The first courthouse was completed in 1690 and a small community developed to serve the needs of the court called “The Horns,” named for the several peninsulas of land which extended west into the Chesapeake Bay from the area. Not until almost a century later in 1773 was the town laid out and officially named Northampton Court House. The last decade of the 18th century and the first quarter of the 19th century saw significant growth and development, including the construction of a third courthouse in 1795, the building of a tavern adjacent to the court green, and several large homes which remain a core part of the town&#x27;s historic landscape today, including Cessford, Park Hall, and Ingleside, all examples of Georgian and Federal architecture. The town was known as Northampton Court House and Peachburg until the name Eastville was officially given to the community around 1800.

<text>Exmore is the largest town in Northampton County on the Eastern Shore of the U.S. state of Virginia. The population was 1,473 at the 2020 census. A popular story is that Exmore received its name because it is the tenth railroad station south of the Delaware state line, so there were &quot;X more&quot; stations to go. The same website also states another theory behind the town&#x27;s name—that it was named for Exmoor, Devon, in south west England. This theory is more plausible because many towns and counties in Virginia were named for places in England. Northampton County itself was named for Northamptonshire.

==Infrastructure and attractions==
Nearby Fort Barfoot (then Camp Pickett, and later Fort Pickett) was established by the U.S. Army in 1941 and was a very large training center during World War II. It was closed by the BRAC Commission in the 1990s, and the facility is now the headquarters for the Virginia National Guard. In May 2014 the U.S. Department of State selected Fort Barfoot (formerly Fort Pickett) as the site of their Foreign Affairs Security Training Center, which opened in November 2019. After the fall of Kabul during September 2021, the federal government temporarily housed 5,900 Afghan refugees at the facility.

The 2-year Blackstone Female Institute / Blackstone College for Girls also operated in Blackstone for many years. The buildings and grounds were later used as the Virginia United Methodist Assembly Center (VUMAC), drawing 19,000 visitors a year before closing in 2016. The Blackstone shopping district (including a Wal-Mart, an outpatient medical center, and a livestock market) attracts customers from a large three-county rural area. The town received a Main Street designation from the state, and a $1 million downtown revitalization project started in 2008. In 2009 the town opened the $4 million James Harris medical center. The Town of Blackstone also has a regional bus terminal that serves 11 counties. The oldest building in town is Schwartz Tavern, built in stages from 1790 to 1840, now used as a museum. Bevell&#x27;s Hardware, a local business, no longer displays a giant 58&#x27; by 20&#x27; (17.7 by 6.1 meter) model railroad layout that had attracted thousands of visitors. The Robert Thomas Carriage Museum, containing 28 restored antique carriages, sleighs, and buggies, was opened in 2007.

== History ==
The Town of Burkeville, Virginia was established in 1877.

Burkeville was named either for a tavern or for a Samuel Burke, and was formerly called &quot;Burke&#x27;s Junction&quot;. It was founded at the junction of the Richmond and Danville Railroad and the Southside Railroad in the mid-nineteenth century. The Southside became the Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad in 1870, then a line in the Norfolk and Western Railway, and finally a line in the Norfolk Southern Railway.

The rail line from Burkeville to Pamplin City, after being abandoned, was converted by the Virginia Department of Parks and Recreation into High Bridge Trail State Park. The state of Virginia has still yet to complete the portion from approximately 1 mile out into the town of Burkeville as of July 1, 2023.

The last major Civil War battle in the Appomattox campaign was fought nearby at Sayler&#x27;s Creek on April 6, 1865. Here were unconditionally surrendered more men than in any other battle on American soil. General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s depleted forces lost over 7,000 men killed, wounded, or taken prisoner either at Sayler&#x27;s Creek or at General John B. Gordon&#x27;s engagement the same day, a few miles west. Lee surrendered at Appomattox three days later.

Ella Graham Agnew was appointed in 1910 by the United States Department of Agriculture to be the first State Agent for women, and was the first woman to be appointed by the Department to represent it in the field. She had moved to the town as a baby and was later buried in the community&#x27;s Sunset Cemetery.

<doc id="137699" wikidata="Q1376628" url="?curid=137699" title="Crewe, Virginia">
<text>Crewe is a town in Nottoway County, Virginia, United States. The population was 2,262 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Crewe was founded in 1888 as a central location to house steam locomotive repair shops for the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad (now called Norfolk Southern) which has a rail yard there for east–west trains carrying Appalachian coal to Hampton Roads for export abroad, and the street pattern was laid out at that time. It was named after the railway town of Crewe in Cheshire, England.

The railroad repair facility&#x27;s importance diminished sharply in the 1950s, as the switch to diesel-electric locomotives required less labor and equipment. Crewe has a small railroad museum. Lottie Moon, a noted Baptist missionary to China, is buried in the town cemetery. A chicken festival is held annually on the third Wednesday in June, as well as the town Homecoming Celebration on the third weekend in May.

The Battle of Sayler&#x27;s Creek, the last major American Civil War engagement before the Army of Northern Virginia&#x27;s surrender at Appomattox Court House, occurred nearby. The Southside Electric Cooperative, Piedmont Geriatric Hospital, and Nottoway Correctional Center are located in Burkeville.

Millbrook and Mountain Hall are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Screenwriter and short story writer Robert Buckner was born in the town.

==Economy==

In recent years retail business in Crewe has declined. This decline is often attributed to the presence of big-box chain stores in nearby Blackstone and Farmville, Virginia. The Star Value grocery store in Crewe closed its doors in 2005, but later on a Dollar General was opened. In November 2005, the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation provided emergency funding for a bus route between Crewe and Blackstone in order to provide access to the Walmart, Food Lion, and other shops in Blackstone to those without other means of transportation.

<doc id="137700" wikidata="Q1376645" url="?curid=137700" title="Orange, Virginia">
<text>Orange is a town and the county seat of Orange County, Virginia, United States. The population was 4,880 at the 2020 census, representing a 3.4% increase since the 2010 census. Orange is northeast of Charlottesville, southwest of Washington, D.C., and east of Founding Father and fourth U.S. president James Madison&#x27;s plantation of Montpelier.

==History==

This area of the Piedmont was occupied by Siouan-speaking peoples at the time of European encounter. Tribes located in coastal areas generally spoke Algonquian languages.

===Pre-Civil War===
The present-day Town of Orange was known as the Town of Orange Court House prior to the late 19th century. Following the establishment of Culpeper County from a part of Orange County in 1749, the courthouse was relocated to Orange Court House from elsewhere in the county. The court convened in the house of a man named Timothy Crosthwait until 1752; after Crosthwait deeded the two acres to the county, a new courthouse was constructed on the property. The town at that time consisted of the courthouse and its related public buildings, a few houses and stores, a tavern and little else. The first U.S. Post Office was constructed in the town in 1796. From 1801 to 1804, the courthouse was replaced with a new building, clerk&#x27;s office and, later, a new jail.

In 1799, Paul Verdier purchased the property of William Bell, an 18th-century farm that included much of the modern-day Town of Orange adjacent to Main Street, near present-day Bellevue and Peliso avenues. Verdier divided the land into lots, which helped shape the town&#x27;s pattern of development. His house, which he named &quot;Montpeliso&quot;, still stands on the land. Growth continued into the 19th century as new roadways were constructed through the town. Along with expanding agricultural markets, the roads helped transform Orange Court House into a regional center. In 1834, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act allowing the incorporation of the Town of Orange Court House, but the act did not have implementing legislation.

Orange Court House continued growing, with several significant downtown buildings being constructed from this point up to the Civil War, including the Sparks Building (1829) the Holladay House (1830), and the St. Thomas Episcopal Church (1833). These buildings still stand as part of the Orange Commercial Historic District. In 1847, the Orange and Alexandria Railroad chose to route their new railway from Alexandria to Gordonsville through Orange. The county court granted the railroad right-of-way through the courthouse property, which required the courthouse to be moved to another location.

The fourth and current courthouse was completed in 1859 in the Italian Villa architectural style and stands today on the corner of Madison Road and Main Street. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The General Assembly passed an act in 1855 which officially incorporated the Town of Orange Court House, but it did not take effect until a majority of citizens qualified to vote consented, which did not occur until after the Civil War.

Orange was a strategically important location during the American Civil War. Just north of town, the Rapidan River was effectively the northern border of the Confederacy from March 1862 to May 1864. Consequently, the area witnessed countless troop movements, patrols, skirmishes, and encampments. In addition, the Town of Orange served as General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s headquarters during that time. General Lee worshipped at the St. Thomas Episcopal Church. This church is also significant as it served as a hospital for Confederate wounded after the Battle of Chancellorsville and the Battle of the Wilderness. Lee passed by this church many times during his stay in Orange. Mort Künstler, an artist of American historical subjects, immortalized this scene in his painting &quot;Soldier of Faith.&quot; County records dating back to its founding in 1734 were protected by a clerk of court removing them to &quot;a place of safety&quot; as Federal troops were moving through Orange and towards Richmond.

===Post-Civil War===
Numerous buildings constructed soon after the Civil War stand in the downtown historic district. Following Virginia&#x27;s readmission to the Union in 1870, Orange Court House officially became a town in 1872 when the petition (required by the 1855 General Assembly act) for an election of town trustees was filed in the court. The first town council meeting was held on June 28, 1872. In 1890, the village changed its name officially to the current-day Town of Orange.

The economy and population continued to grow up until the time of a fire in 1909, which destroyed most of the eastern portion of town. Like nearby Gordonsville, Orange&#x27;s importance as a railroad hub began declining in the early 20th century. Because of its location at the confluence of two major roadways and the establishment of the Orange Automobile Club in 1910, the town became a regional center for automobile sales and services. Its accessibility allowed it to maintain a relatively healthy economy through the Great Depression.

A notable company in Orange during that period was American Silk Mills, Inc., which was established in 1929 and processed raw silk into a finished material. During World War II, the mill was awarded a presidential citation for its production of parachutes for Allied troops. Although much of the mid-20th-century industry moved to other locations, the population of Orange has grown steadily up through the 2010 census.

As of September 2013, Orange County contained 33 places listed on the National Register of Historic Places, seven of which are within the Town of Orange.

<doc id="137702" wikidata="Q15551" url="?curid=137702" title="Sitges">
<text>; , ) is a town about 35 kilometres southwest of Barcelona, in Catalonia, Spain, renowned worldwide for its film festival, Carnival, and LGBT culture. Located between the Garraf Massif and the Mediterranean Sea, it is known for its beaches, nightspots, and historical sites.

While the roots of Sitges&#x27; artistic reputation date back to the late 19th century, when painter Santiago Rusiñol took up residence there during the summer, the town became a centre for the 1960s counterculture in mainland Spain during the Francoist regime, and became known as &quot;Ibiza in miniature&quot;.

Today, the economy of Sitges is based on tourism and culture, offering more than 4,500 hotel beds, half of them in four-star hotels.

Sitges is a gay-friendly destination with many establishments catering for the LGBT community and popular gay beaches.

Almost 35% of the approximately 26,000 permanent inhabitants are from the Netherlands, the UK, France, and Scandinavia, whose children attend international schools in the area. There are 17 beaches. Sitges was also the site of the annual Bilderberg conference held in June 2010.

Sitges has been referred to as the Saint-Tropez of Spain, with property prices approaching those of the most expensive European cities, the main reason for this being the setting by the sea and the surrounding . Proximity to Barcelona-El Prat Airport is also a major advantage.

== Toponymy ==
The name of the town is simply the Catalan word &quot;sitges&quot;, plural of &quot;sitja&quot;, meaning silos in English.

==History==
Human presence in the area dates to at least the Neolithic era, and an Iberian settlement from the 4th century. In the 1st century BC, it included two separated villages, later absorbed by the Romans.

During the Middle Ages, a castle was built in Sitges, owned by the bishopric of Barcelona, which later ceded it to count Mir Geribert (1041). In the 12th century, the town fell under the rule of the Sitges family. The latter held it until 1308, when Agnes of Sitges sold the town to Bernat de Fonollar, after whose death it went to the Pia Almoina, a charitable institution, to which it belonged until 1814.

Between the late-18th century and the early-20th, the history of Sitges was dominated by its close links with Spain&#x27;s overseas territories, most importantly Cuba. Thousands of youngsters from Sitges settled in Santiago de Cuba, Guantánamo and other areas in Eastern Cuba. Most of them were employed in commerce, usually working for relatives already established in the island. Some of them thrived and created big firms, like Facundo Bacardí, founder of Ron Bacardí, and Jaime Brugal, who later moved to the Dominican Republic and established Ron Brugal. Some others, after having amassed a certain fortune, settled back in Sitges, generally living on rent or investing in sectores like wine or shoe making. These were known as &quot;Americanos&quot;, known for their habit of planting palm trees in their Caribbean-looking houses, smoking Cuban cigars and rum drinking. The &quot;americanos&quot; left a huge legacy in Sitges which can still be seen in its architecture and the history of most local families.

After Spain lost its overseas territories as a result of the Spanish-American War in 1898, the migration flow from Sitges to Cuba continued, but most of the trade ended. As most of Catalan economy, Sitges found its biggest market in the rest of Spain. Shoe making shaped Sitges&#x27; economy during the first third of the 20th century. Sitges economy was mostly based on the production of wine until the late 19th century, when the first mechanized shoe factory in Spanish history was established in the town in 1874, starting a powerful shoe making sector which employed ca. 80% of local workers by the mid-20th century. The tourist boom of the 1960s ended the era of shoe making and made local economy essentially depending on tourism and services.

Due to the wave of artists settling in the town in the wake of Santiago Rusiñol, who established his studio (nowadays Museu del Cau Ferrat) wealthy families from Barcelona built summer residences in Sitges, especially in the garden city known as Terramar. Sitges acquired an international reputation and attracted celebrities. American businessman, art collector, and philanthropist Charles Deering held an important art collection in Sitges between 1910 and 1921, where he built the impressive &quot;Palau Maricel&quot; (Maricel Palace). Intellectuals like G. K. Chesterton, who visited the town in 1926 and 1935, or the German boxer Max Schmelling, who trained for his match against Paulino Uzcudun in Terramar Hotel in 1934.

For most of the Civil War (1936-1939), Sitges was controlled by Republican forces, with the ensuing repression against members of the Catholic Church and conservatives in general, until Franco&#x27;s troops seized the town in January 1939 and repressed the elites that had ruled the town during the Second Republic and the war. 

The British war journalist Henry Buckley (author of &quot;The Life and Death of the Spanish Republic,&quot; 1940) lived for a few months in Sitges during the conflict, marrying a local woman. He would eventually retire in the mid-1960s in the town, where he purchased a house and died in 1972.

In 1958, political leaders (Liberals and Conservatives) from the country of Colombia met in Sitges and signed a peace treaty, the &quot;Declaration of Sitges&quot;, instituting a consociationalist democracy in Colombia and creating the National Front.

== Geography ==
The municipality of Sitges is located in the Garraf comarca. It is bordered to the north by the municipalities of Olivella and Begues, to the west by Sant Pere de Ribes and Vilanova i la Geltrú, to the east by Gavà and Castelldefels, and to the south by the Mediterranean Sea.



==Carnival==
For over a century, Sitges has celebrated Carnestoltes, or Carnival, between the months of February and March, according to the liturgical calendar. The festivities begin on Dijous Gras, or Fat Thursday, with King Carnestoltes&#x27; arrival. They continue until the burial of the sardine — late afternoon on Ash Wednesday.

Folk dances and xatonades (traditional local salad served with assorted omelets) are also characteristic carnival elements. The two most important moments are the Rua de la Disbauxa, or the Debauchery Parade, on Sunday night and the Rua de l&#x27;Extermini, or Extermination Parade, on Tuesday night. Around forty floats with more than 2,000 participants fill Sitges. Many people come from all around to see it, describing it as a favourite time of year because of the celebration.

==Gastronomy==
&quot;Xató&quot; is Sitges&#x27; most typical dish. Its first recorded mention is in local newspaper &quot;Eco de Sitges&quot; report on Fat Thursday, published on 16 February 1896. The report refers to a meal that three days before had gathered together a selected group of Catalan artists and intellectuals, including Santiago Rusiñol, Miquel Utrillo and Gaietà Buigas. The name &quot;xató&quot; comes from an expression pronounced years before by Canudas, a member of the Rusiñol&#x27;s group.

Malvasia is a delicate liquor wine served in Sitges, primarily with dessert. The name &quot;malvasia&quot; comes from the Peloponnesian port Monemvasía.

==Beaches==


Sitges has 17 sand beaches. Four of them are in the east: the first one called Les Botigues at the beginning of the coast, next to the beaches of Castelldefels and the other three are following the coast of Garraf (Road C-31). One of them is Garraf village beach.

There are eleven beaches in the town and two to its west, which are difficult to access.

All the eastern and urban beaches have flags indicating the state of the sea and most of them have quality diplomas and blue flags awarded by the European Union.

There are three main nudist beaches located in Sitges. One of which is Platja dels Balmins, the second nudist beach is Platja d&#x27;Aiguadolç, both of these beaches are populated by all members of the community. The third nudist beach is Playa del Muerto, which is more populated by the gay community. Platja dels Balmins and Platja d&#x27;Aiguadolç are located on the eastern side of Sitges while Playa del Muerto is located on the western side of Sitges and is more difficult to reach.

==Education==
There are six public Catalan primary schools in Sitges: Escola Agnès de Sitges, Escola Esteve Barrachina, Escola Maria Ossó, Escola Miquel Utrillo, Escola Pia Sitges, and the catholic Camp Joliu.

Private schools include the French &quot;Lycée Bel Air&quot;, and the English &quot;Richmond International&quot; and &quot;The Olive Tree School&quot;.

The British School of Barcelona (BSB) also operates a campus in Sitges, providing education for primary (3-11 years), located in the upscale neighbourhood of Vallpineda.

The Institute of the Arts Barcelona is an international leader in performing arts training and education college based out of Terramar.

== LGBT Culture ==
Sitges is one of the world&#x27;s top leaders in the protection and advocating for equal rights for the LGBT community. It is often described as the gay capital of Europe, particularly in peak season of the summer months of May to September.

With its spirit and vibrant urban atmosphere, Sitges has become one of the top gay holiday spots for LGBT tourists and is at the centre of gay European nightlife, including spas, shopping, and dining. A small but compact city, it contains a huge concentration of gay-friendly hotels, restaurants, shops, and over 20 gay bars.

The key gay events are Carnival, Sitges Pride, Bears Week, Festa Major, and Circuit Barcelona. (There is also a Sunway Sitges International Chess Festival.)

==Motor racing==
Sitges is part of the long history of motor racing in Catalonia. From 1908 to 1920, events were staged over public roads from Sitges to Canyelles to Vilanova i la Geltrú, and from Mataró to Vilassar de Mar and Argentona. In 1922 and 1923, the Real Moto Club de Catalunya ran the Penya Rhin Grand Prix over a 9-mile circuit around the town of Vilafranca del Penedès until it was replaced by a short lived purpose built circuit, the banked Autódromo de Sitges-Terramar, which is still visible at . Albert Divo won the only Spanish Grand Prix held at the banked Sitges Terramar driving a Sunbeam.

<text>The Martian Way and Other Stories is a 1955 collection of four science fiction stories (3 novelettes and one novella by American writer Isaac Asimov, previously published in 1952 and 1954. Although single-author story collections generally sell poorly, &quot;The Martian Way and Other Stories&quot; did well enough that Doubleday science fiction editor Walter I. Bradbury was willing to publish a second collection, &quot;Earth Is Room Enough&quot;, in 1957.

<text>Paul David Wellstone (July 21, 1944 – October 25, 2002) was an American academic, author, and politician who represented Minnesota in the United States Senate from 1991 until he was killed in a plane crash near Eveleth, Minnesota, in 2002. A member of the Democratic Party (DFL), Wellstone was a leader of the populist and progressive wings of the party.

Born in Washington, D.C., Wellstone grew up in Northern Virginia. He went on to graduate from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a Bachelor&#x27;s of Arts and a doctorate in political science. In 1969, Wellstone was hired as a professor at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, where he taught until his election to the Senate in 1990. In addition, he also worked as a local activist and community organizer in rural Rice County. In 1982, he made his first bid for political office in that year&#x27;s Minnesota State Auditor race. His campaign was unsuccessful, losing to Republican incumbent Arne Carlson.

Wellstone challenged two-term Republican incumbent Rudy Boschwitz in the 1990 United States Senate election. Wellstone was widely seen as an underdog and was significantly outspent by Boschwitz. Using his progressive populism and grassroots campaigning tactics, such as his iconic green school bus, Wellstone won in an upset victory that gained him national attention. He was the only challenger in the country that year to defeat an incumbent senator. In his 1996 reelection campaign, he defeated Boschwitz in a rematch. He won the elections with 50.4% and 50.3% of the vote, respectively.

While in the U.S. Senate, Wellstone was a supporter of environmental protection, labor groups, and health care reform. He notably authored the &quot;Wellstone Amendment&quot; for the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. However, his efforts toward campaign finance reform were overturned in 2010 by the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot;. Wellstone was a candidate for reelection to the Senate in 2002 and was facing former Saint Paul mayor Norm Coleman in a competitive race when, a few weeks before the election, Wellstone died in a plane crash near Eveleth, Minnesota. His wife, Sheila, and daughter, Marcia, also died on board. After his sudden death, Wellstone was replaced on the ballot by former Vice President Walter Mondale, who lost by a slim margin to Coleman. Wellstone&#x27;s sons, David and Mark, were not on the flight, and until 2018 co-chaired the Wellstone Action nonprofit organization (now named Re:Power) in honor of their parents.

==Background and education==
Wellstone was born in Washington, D.C., the second son of Ukrainian Jewish immigrants Leon and Minnie Wellstone. His father changed the family name from Wexelstein after encountering antisemitism during the 1930s. Raised in Arlington, Virginia, Wellstone attended Wakefield High School and Yorktown High School, graduating in 1962.

Wellstone attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) on a wrestling scholarship. In college he was an undefeated Atlantic Coast Conference wrestling champion. After his freshman year, he married Sheila Ison Wellstone. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1965, and was elected Phi Beta Kappa. In May 1969, Wellstone earned a PhD in political science from UNC. His doctoral dissertation on the roots of black militancy was titled &quot;Black Militants in the Ghetto: Why They Believe in Violence&quot;.

==Early career and activism==
In August 1969, Wellstone accepted a tenure-track position at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, where he taught political science until his election to the Senate in 1990. During the 1970s and 1980s, he also began community organizing, working with the working poor and other politically disenfranchised communities. He founded the Organization for a Better Rice County, a group consisting mainly of single parents on welfare. The organization advocated for public housing, affordable health care, improved public education, free school lunches, and a publicly funded day care center. In 1978, he published his first book, &quot;How the Rural Poor Got Power: Narrative of a Grassroots Organizer&quot;, chronicling his work with the organization.

Wellstone was arrested twice during this period for civil disobedience. The Federal Bureau of Investigation began a case file on him after his May 1970 arrest for protesting the Vietnam War at the Federal Office Building in Minneapolis. In 1984 Wellstone was arrested again, for trespassing during a foreclosure protest at a bank.

Wellstone extended his activism to the Minnesota labor movement. In the summer of 1985, he walked the picket line with striking P-9ers during a labor dispute at the Hormel Meat Packing plant in Austin, Minnesota. The Minnesota National Guard was called in during the strike to ensure that Hormel could hire permanent replacement workers.

The trustees of Carleton College briefly fired Wellstone in the late 1970s for his activism and lack of academic publications. After his students held a sit-in, the trustees rehired him and gave him tenure. Wellstone remains the youngest tenured faculty member in Carleton&#x27;s history.

==Early political career==
Wellstone first sought public office in 1982. He received the Democratic nomination for Minnesota State Auditor after an impassioned speech at the state convention. In the general election he received 45% of the vote, losing to Republican incumbent, and future Minnesota governor, Arne Carlson. Wellstone remained active in Democratic politics in the mid-1980s. He served as an elected committeeman for the Democratic National Committee in 1984, and in 1986 began a second campaign for State Auditor before dropping out to tend his mother&#x27;s failing health. In 1988, Wellstone chaired Jesse Jackson&#x27;s campaign for the presidency in Minnesota. After the primary, he co-chaired Michael Dukakis&#x27;s campaign in the state.

==U.S. Senate campaigns (1990–2002)==

In 1990, Wellstone ran for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Rudy Boschwitz, beginning the race as a serious underdog. He narrowly won the election despite being outspent 7 to 1. Wellstone played off his underdog image with quirky, humorous ads created by political consultant Bill Hillsman, including &quot;Fast Paul&quot; and &quot;Looking for Rudy&quot;, a pastiche of the 1989 Michael Moore documentary &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot;. Boschwitz was also hurt by a letter his supporters wrote, on campaign stationery, to members of the Minnesota Jewish community days before the election, accusing Wellstone of being a &quot;bad Jew&quot; for marrying a Gentile and not raising his children in the Jewish faith. (Boschwitz, like Wellstone, is Jewish.) Wellstone&#x27;s reply, widely broadcast on Minnesota television, was &quot;He has a problem with Christians, then.&quot; Boschwitz was the only incumbent U.S. senator not to be reelected that year.

Wellstone defeated Boschwitz again in 1996. During that campaign, Boschwitz ran ads accusing Wellstone of being &quot;embarrassingly liberal&quot; and calling him &quot;Senator Welfare&quot;. He accused Wellstone of supporting flag burning, a move some believe backfired. Before that accusation, the race was close, but Wellstone beat Boschwitz by 197,236 votes despite again being significantly outspent. Reform Party candidate Dean Barkley received 7% of the vote.

Wellstone&#x27;s upset victory in 1990 and reelection in 1996 were also credited to a grassroots campaign that inspired college students, poor people, and minorities to get involved in politics, many for the first time. In 1990, the number of young people involved in the campaign was so notable that shortly after the election, Walter Mondale told Wellstone that &quot;the kids won it for you&quot;. Wellstone also spent much of his Senate career working with the Hmong community in Minnesota, which had not previously been much involved in American politics, and with the veterans community—serving on the Senate Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs, successfully campaigning for atomic veterans to receive compensation from the federal government, and for increased spending on health care for veterans.

In 2002, Wellstone campaigned for reelection to a third term despite an earlier campaign pledge to serve only two. His Republican opponent was Norm Coleman, a two-term mayor of St. Paul and former Democrat, who had supported Wellstone&#x27;s 1996 campaign. Earlier that year Wellstone announced he had a mild form of multiple sclerosis, causing the limp he had believed was an old wrestling injury.

Wellstone was in a line of center-left senators from the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL). The first three, Hubert Humphrey, Eugene McCarthy, and Walter Mondale, were all prominent in the national Democratic Party. Shortly after joining the Senate, South Carolina Senator Fritz Hollings told Wellstone, &quot;You remind me of Hubert Humphrey. You talk too much.&quot;

==Presidential aspirations==
Shortly after his reelection to the Senate in 1996, Wellstone began contemplating a run for his party&#x27;s nomination for President of the United States in 2000. In May 1997, he embarked on a cross-country speaking and listening tour dubbed &quot;The Children&#x27;s Tour.&quot; It took him through rural areas of Mississippi and Appalachia and the inner cities of Minneapolis, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Baltimore. He intended to retrace the steps Robert F. Kennedy took during a similar tour in 1966, and to highlight the fact that conditions had improved slightly for African-Americans since the civil rights movement, but not much for poor whites despite their dependency on food stamps, government jobs (military) and the massive federal investment in their regions, especially Appalachia.

In 1998, Wellstone formed an exploratory committee and a leadership PAC, the Progressive Politics Network, that paid for his travels to Iowa and New Hampshire, two early primary states in the nomination process. He spoke before organized labor and local Democrats, using the slogan &quot;I represent the democratic wing of the Democratic Party.&quot; Vermont governor Howard Dean later incorporated that phrase into his stump speech in the 2004 US presidential election.

On January 9, 1999, Wellstone called a press conference at the Minnesota State Capitol at which he said he lacked the stamina necessary for a national campaign, citing chronic back problems he ascribed to an old wrestling injury. His pain was later diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. He thereafter endorsed former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, the only Democratic candidate to challenge Vice President Al Gore.

==Political positions==

Wellstone was known for his work for peace, the environment, labor, and health care; he also joined his wife Sheila to support the rights of victims of domestic violence. He made the issue of mental illness a central focus in his career. He was a supporter of immigration to the U.S. He opposed the first Gulf War in 1991 and, in the months before his death, spoke out against the government&#x27;s threats to go to war with Iraq again. He was strongly supported by groups such as Americans for Democratic Action, the AFL–CIO, the Sierra Club, the American Civil Liberties Union, and People for the American Way. He was often called &quot;the conscience of the Senate&quot;.

In 1996, Wellstone voted for the Defense of Marriage Act. He later asked his supporters to educate him on the issue and by 2001, when he wrote his autobiography, &quot;Conscience of a Liberal&quot;, Wellstone admitted that he had made a mistake.

Wellstone was one of only eight senators to vote against repealing the Glass–Steagall Act in 1999.

After voting against the congressional authorization for the war in Iraq on October 11, 2002, amid a tight election, Wellstone is said to have told his wife, &quot;I just cost myself the election&quot;.

In the 2002 campaign, the Green Party ran a candidate against Wellstone, a move some Greens opposed. The party&#x27;s 2000 vice-presidential nominee, Winona LaDuke, called Wellstone &quot;a champion of the vast majority of our issues&quot;. Some liberals criticized the Green Party&#x27;s decision to oppose Wellstone.

Wellstone was the author of the &quot;Wellstone Amendment&quot; to the McCain-Feingold Bill for campaign finance reform, in what came to be known as the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. The law, including the Wellstone Amendment, was called unconstitutional by groups and individuals of various political perspectives, including the California Democratic Party, the National Rifle Association of America, and Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority whip. On December 10, 2003, the Supreme Court upheld McCain-Feingold&#x27;s key provisions, including the Wellstone Amendment. Wellstone called McCain-Feingold&#x27;s protection of &quot;advocacy&quot; groups a &quot;loophole&quot; allowing &quot;special interests&quot; to run last-minute election ads. He pushed an amendment to extend McCain-Feingold&#x27;s ban on last-minute ads to nonprofits like &quot;the NRA, the Sierra Club, the Christian Coalition, and others&quot;. Under the Wellstone Amendment, these organizations could advertise using only money raised under strict &quot;hard money&quot; limits—no more than $5,000 per individual.

In January 2010, in &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the McCain-Feingold Act and removed restrictions on the NRA&#x27;s and others&#x27; ability to campaign at election time.

===Gulf War===
Wellstone voted against authorizing the use of force before the Persian Gulf War on January 12, 1991 (the vote was 52–47 in favor). He also voted against the use of force before the Iraq War on October 11, 2002 (the vote was 77–23 in favor). Wellstone was one of 11 senators to vote against both the 1991 and 2002 resolutions. The others were also all Democrats: Daniel Akaka of Hawaii; Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico; Robert Byrd of West Virginia; Kent Conrad of North Dakota; Daniel Inouye of Hawaii; Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts; Patrick Leahy of Vermont; Carl Levin of Michigan; Barbara Mikulski of Maryland; and Paul Sarbanes of Maryland.

===Other key military action votes===
Wellstone supported requests for military action by President Bill Clinton, including Operation Restore Hope in Somalia (1992), Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti (1994), Operation Deliberate Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1995), Operation Desert Fox in Iraq (1998), and Operation Allied Force in Yugoslavia (1999). On July 1, 1994, during the 100-day Rwandan genocide from April 6 to mid-July 1994, Wellstone authored an amendment to the 1995 defense appropriations bill.

==Death==
On October 25, 2002, Wellstone, along with seven others, died in an airplane crash in northeastern Minnesota, at 10:22 a.m. He was 58 years old. The other victims were his wife, Sheila; one of his three children, Marcia; the pilots, Richard Conry and Michael Guess; and campaign staffers Mary McEvoy, Tom Lapic and Will McLaughlin. Autopsy reports determined that five of the passengers likely died instantly upon impact, while three others—McEvoy, Lapic, and McLaughlin—showed signs of smoke inhalation from the ensuing fire. The airplane was en route to Eveleth, where Wellstone was to attend the funeral of Martin Rukavina, a steelworker whose son Tom Rukavina served in the Minnesota House of Representatives. Wellstone decided to go to the funeral instead of a Minneapolis rally and fundraiser attended by Mondale and fellow Senator Ted Kennedy. He was to debate Norm Coleman in Duluth, Minnesota, that night.
The Beechcraft King Air A100 plane crashed into dense forest about two miles from the Eveleth airport, while operating under instrument flight rules. It had no flight data recorders. Autopsy toxicology results on both pilots were negative for drug or alcohol use. Icing, though widely reported on in following days, was considered and eventually rejected as a significant factor in the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) judged that while cloud cover might have prevented the flight crew from seeing the airport, icing did not affect the plane&#x27;s performance during its descent.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which initially sent agents to help recover debris, investigated possible foul play in the crash. After a few days, it determined that the crash was accidental, but only after following several criminal leads involving death threats. Wellstone had been receiving death threats since he took office; the FBI tapped his phone to locate the callers. Documents about the FBI&#x27;s involvement in investigating Wellstone&#x27;s death were not publicly released until 2010. Government documents also indicated that the FBI had been following Wellstone before he became a senator, and included records dating as far back as his arrest at a 1970 antiwar protest.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) later determined that the crash&#x27;s likely cause was &quot;the flight crew&#x27;s failure to maintain adequate airspeed, which led to an aerodynamic stall from which they did not recover&quot;. The last two radar readings detected the plane traveling at or just below its predicted stall speed given conditions at the time. Aviation experts speculated the pilots might have lost situational awareness because they were lost and looking for the airport. They had been off course for several minutes and &quot;clicked on&quot; the runway lights, something not usually done in good visibility. There was a problem with the airport&#x27;s VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigational beacon. According to Minnesota Public Radio:


Other pilots at the charter company told NTSB that pilot Richard Conry and first officer (co-pilot) Michael Guess had both displayed below-average flying skills. Conry had a well-known tendency to allow copilots to take over all aircraft functions as if they were the sole pilot. After the crash, three copilots told of occasions on which they had to take control of the aircraft away from Conry. After one of those incidents, three days before the crash, the copilot (not Guess) had urged Conry to retire. In a post-accident interview, Conry&#x27;s longtime friend and fellow aviator Timothy Cooney said that he had last spoken to Conry in June 2001 and had expressed concerns about difficulties he had flying King Airs as late as April of that year, 18 months before the crash. Significant discrepancies were also found in the captain&#x27;s flight logs in the course of the post-accident investigation, indicating he had probably greatly exaggerated his flying experience, most of which had been accrued before a 9–10 year hiatus from flying due to a fraud conviction and poor eyesight. He underwent LASIK surgery, but it had improved his vision to only 20/50 or 20/30. FAA regulations required Conry to wear corrective lenses, but his wife and Cooney said Conry did not do so after the surgery. The coroner who examined his body was unable to determine whether Conry was wearing contact lenses at the time of the crash.

Coworkers described Guess as having had to be consistently reminded to keep his hand on the throttle and maintain airspeed during approaches. He had two previous piloting jobs, one with Skydive Hutchinson as a pilot (1988–1989), and another with Northwest Airlines as a trainee instructor (1999), and was dismissed from both for lack of ability. Conry&#x27;s widow told the NTSB that her husband told her &quot;the other pilots thought Guess was not a good pilot&quot;.

===Aftermath===
Wellstone died just 11 days before his potential reelection in a crucial race to maintain Democratic control of the Senate. Campaigning halted on all sides. Minnesota law required that his name be stricken from the ballot, to be replaced by a candidate chosen by the party. The DFL selected former Vice President Walter Mondale.

The memorial service for Wellstone and the other victims of the crash was held in Williams Arena at the University of Minnesota and broadcast live on national TV. The lengthy service was dotted with political speeches, open advocacy on political issues, and a giant beach ball batted around the crowd in the style of a beach party. Many high-profile politicians attended the memorial, including former President Bill Clinton, former Vice President Al Gore, and more than half the U.S. Senate. The White House offered to send Vice President Dick Cheney to the service, but the Wellstone family declined.

Some criticized the service for having an inappropriate tone and resembling a &quot;pep rally&quot; or &quot;partisan foot-stomp&quot;. Wellstone campaign manager Jeff Blodgett noted after the event that it had not been scripted and apologized to people who were offended or surprised. In his 2003 book &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them&quot;, Al Franken wrote that &quot;reasonable people of good will were genuinely offended&quot; but argued that conservative media figures exploited outrage at the event for political gain. At the time of writing, Franken was a comedian and liberal commentator. Five years later, in 2008, Franken was elected to the Senate seat once held by Wellstone.

Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, who had stated his preference to appoint a Democrat to serve the remainder of Wellstone&#x27;s term, was &quot;disgusted&quot; by the event, walking out and later threatening to appoint &quot;an ordinary citizen&quot; instead. On November 4, the day before the election, Ventura appointed state planning commissioner Dean Barkley, founder and chair of Ventura&#x27;s Independence Party of Minnesota, to serve the remaining two months of Wellstone&#x27;s term; he had run against Wellstone in 1996. Coleman received 49.5% of the vote, defeating Mondale. In 2008, he was narrowly defeated (by 312 votes) in his bid for reelection by Franken, in a three-way race that included Barkley.

==Legacy==

The AFL–CIO has created the AFL–CIO Senator Paul Wellstone Award for supporters of the rights of labor unions. Presidential candidate Howard Dean and California state senator John Burton both received the first award in January 2003. In 2004, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill dedicated the Paul and Sheila Wellstone Memorial Garden as a tribute to the couple, both graduates of the university. Also in 2004, Mason Jennings released &quot;The Ballad of Paul and Sheila&quot;, a song memorializing the Wellstones, on his album &quot;Use Your Voice&quot;.

Near the site of the plane crash, a memorial to the Wellstones was dedicated on September 25, 2005. His distinctive green bus was present, as well as hundreds of supporters and loved ones. The six-acre site, off Bodas Road near Eveleth, is a tribute to Wellstone&#x27;s life and career, and to his family members and staff who died in the crash. The memorial is about three-quarters of a mile from the crash site, which is on private land. It is divided into three parts: the Legacy Trail, the Commemorative Circle, and the Crash Site Narrative Space.

Paul and Sheila Wellstone were buried at Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis, the same cemetery in which Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey is interred. A memorial sculpture near Bde Maka Ska marks their grave sites. Visitors sometimes follow the Jewish custom of placing small stones on the boulder marking the family plot or on the individual markers. Wellstone Action, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, trains citizens and potential candidates with a progressive agenda.

In 2007, former First Lady Rosalynn Carter joined David Wellstone to push Congress to pass legislation regarding mental health insurance. Wellstone and Carter worked to pass the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, which requires equal coverage of mental and physical illnesses when policies include both types of coverage; both testified about the bill before a House subcommittee in 2007. David said of his father, &quot;Although he was passionate on many issues, there was not another issue that surpassed this in terms of his passion.&quot; Because Paul Wellstone&#x27;s brother had had mental illness, Wellstone had fought for changes in mental health and insurance laws when he reached the Senate. The St. Paul branch of the Emily Program eating disorder clinic has a Wellstone Room in its adult inpatient unit. The room is dedicated to Paul and Sheila Wellstone for their work on treating eating disorders.

On March 5, 2008, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007, by a vote of 268–148. It was sponsored by Representatives Patrick Kennedy and Jim Ramstad, both of whom are recovering alcoholics. The narrower Senate bill S. 558, passed earlier, was introduced by Kennedy&#x27;s father, Senator Edward Kennedy, Pete Domenici, and Mike Enzi.

First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt visited the Mimslyn during a short visit in the late 1930s and former Virginia Governor Mark Warner visited in January 2008. The site of the Mimslyn is on the former location of &quot;Aventine Hall,&quot; the home of Peter Bouck Borst, a mid-19th century lawyer. Aventine was carefully removed to make way for the construction of the Mimslyn in the 1930s. &quot;Aventine Hall&quot; is now located on South Court Street (this is a private residence) in the Town of Luray, Virginia.

The Luray Singing Tower, officially known as the Belle Brown Northcott Memorial, was erected in 1937 in memory of Colonel Theodore Clay Northcott&#x27;s wife (Northcott was the owner of the Luray Caverns).

==History==
The Town of Luray was officially established by act of the Virginia General Assembly on February 6, 1812, on ten acres of land near the Hawksbill Creek. On March 21, 1871, by act of General Assembly, the Town became an “Incorporated Town,” containing approximately 442 acres.   

In 1781, Dirreck Pennypacker located the Redwell Furnace about a mile north of the current Town at Yager’s Spring. Here, Pennypacker operated a forge and a foundry making nails, farm tools, kettles, stoves, and other iron products. The iron works was later renamed the Isabella Furnace. More industry was located about a mile south of Luray at Willow Grove Mill. The small village known as Mundellsville contained a flour mill, carding mill, tannery and blacksmith shop. The economy of the Town would prosper from the nearness of the local industry. 

On August 21, 1812, the Town of Luray was surveyed on the lands owned by Mr. Isaac Ruffner.  The first streets platted were Main Street, due west of the Hawksbill Creek, to the top of the hill at present day Court Street.  Court Street was called Peter Street in memory of Peter Ruffner, an early pioneer in the area.  Three blocks of three lots each on either side of Peter Street were laid out.  Three cross streets were mapped out due north and south, going west from Hawksbill Creek. These were Water Street (now Hawksbill Street), High Street (now Bank Street) and West Street (now Court Street).  The first house was built here in 1814.  The lots were all the same size and contained about half an acre.  In 1818, the Town was extended by adding 26 lots.  The Town now had 44 lots and the eastern end was at Hudson’s alley near the railroad.  These lots were conveyed to the purchasers by Isaac Ruffner on May 9, 1818.  

About 1845, according to Howe’s History of Virginia, Luray contained several mercantile stores, two or three churches, and a population of about 500.  A description of Luray, in 1867 indicates Luray still had a population of 500.  During the 1880’s the population of Luray more than doubled, from 630 in 1880 to 1,386 in 1890.  The Town continued to grow in size from its original 442 acres that was established by the Town Charter in 1871.  

In 1941, the first annexation occurred when 289 acres were added to the Town for a total of 835 acres. Ten years later, 284 acres were annexed for a total of 1,365 acres. In 1963, the Town added 410 acres for a total of 1,775 acres. The recent annexation effective since January 1, 1985, added an additional 1,220 acres for total of 2,995 acres.

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, citizens living in the eastern portion of Shenandoah County – which is now Page County - traveled 35 to 40 miles to the Town of Woodstock, which served as Shenandoah’s county seat. During this era, a county seat served as an important location for conducting essential business such as recording deeds, paying property taxes, and settling disputes in civil court. Therefore, the Town which served as the location of a county seat was usually the undisputed epicenter of civic life for a county and region. For the citizens who lived in the far eastern portions of Shenandoah County, traveling to Woodstock was not only far in distance, but it was an arduous trip as well. Often the trip entailed crossing a mountain pass and several streams. This inconvenience prompted the General Assembly to establish Page County in 1831 with Luray, due to its central location, becoming the logical place for this new county seat. The establishment of Luray as the county seat of the newly formed Page County ensured that the Town evolved into the center for civic, cultural, and economic life.

* B. Presgraves (2005-2020)
* Jerry Dofflemyer (2021-2024)

== Civil War ==

Luray is often cited as the location (as is Yager&#x27;s Mill, on the north side of town, near Furnace Hill) of an engagement between Union and Confederate cavalry on September 24, 1864, though it actually took place approximately three miles north of the town, and even to the north of Yager&#x27;s Mill.

Following his victory at the Battle of Fisher&#x27;s Hill Union general Philip Sheridan sent approximately 6,000 troopers under Brigadier General Alfred Torbert into the Luray Valley. Torbert&#x27;s men engaged approximately 1,200 Confederate cavalry under Brigadier General Williams Wickham. Despite victory in this affair and moving toward New Market Gap following the engagement, Torbert halted his command that night on the Page County side of the Massanutten, thereby missing an opportunity to cut off Confederate General Jubal Early&#x27;s retreat from Fisher&#x27;s Hill. Private Philip Baybutt of the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry received the Medal of Honor for capturing a Confederate flag during the engagement. This action was part of Sheridan&#x27;s portion of the Valley Campaigns of 1864.

&quot;Aunt Betty&#x27;s Story: The Narrative of Bethany Veney, A Slave Woman&quot; (the book&#x27;s cover reads merely &quot;Aunt Betty&#x27;s Story&quot;) is the 1889 autobiography of Bethany Veney&#x27;s life in Luray.

==Climate==
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and cool winters. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Luray has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;).

==Transportation==

US 211 and US 340 intersect in Luray and are the main roadways into and out of the area. US 211 Bus and US 340 Bus provide local access to downtown Luray.

About 9.0% of families and 12.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 16.0% of those under age 18 and 17.7% of those age 65 or over.

==History==

The town was founded in 1837 by two brothers, Daniel and Henry Forrer, who settled in the area to take advantage of the natural resources found in and around Shenandoah. The natural resources included extensive iron ore deposits, hardwood, high-grade limestone, and waterpower. The proximity to the South Fork of the Shenandoah River was also a great benefit and was later used by the Forrers to transport iron ore and other commodities produced by the Shenandoah Iron Works to broader markets downstream.

On February 20, 1838, the Forrers established the first post office in Shenandoah under the name Shenandoah Iron Works with Henry Forrer being the postmaster. Development of the town ensued thereafter with houses, businesses, and industries developed astride of the Shenandoah River. The Shenandoah Iron Works, which was owned and operated by Daniel and Henry Forrer, was also located along the riverbanks. Ten houses were built facing the river in the Furnace Hollow section of town by a man named Mr. Pee Dee, hence, the name of this section of town today. Other historical structures were also built including Stephens Cottage, the South Fork House, Mt. Lebanon United Church at Comertown, and the Old Verbena Mill in Verbena, just south of town off Route 340.

The Town of Shenandoah played an instrumental role in the Civil War. Three iron ore furnaces around Shenandoah smelted raw iron into pig iron. Unlike during the pre-war years when pig iron was shipped on flat boats on the Shenandoah River to Harpers Ferry, during the war, the pig iron was shipped by wagon to Gordonsville, and subsequently by rail to Richmond for use at the Tredegar Iron Works. In addition to the pig iron, cannonballs were manufactured at some of the local furnaces and shipped out, along with gunpowder from a local gunpowder plant, for use by the Confederacy.

After the Civil War, two men, William Milnes, Jr. and Thomas Johns came to Shenandoah in 1866 and purchased including the Forrer&#x27;s Shenandoah Iron Works. These men continued the iron works; however, they introduced modern tools and machinery that were patented in order to improve production.

One of the major distinctions of the Town of Shenandoah is its flood prone nature due to its close proximity to the Shenandoah River. Time and time again, the town has been ravaged with floods. With all of the major development of the time occurring in or near the flood plain area, it was only a matter of time before a major flood wiped out the entire town.

On September 28 and 29, 1870, the inevitable happened when flood waters decimated the entire developed portion of Shenandoah. Between 30 and 60 buildings were completely destroyed or washed away as the water of the South Fork of the Shenandoah River billowed its way through town.

Despite the wrath of the flood, William Milnes was able to take charge of the town and rebuild with relative ease. At the time of the flood, the entire country was experiencing prosperity due to an industrial boom. Milnes took this opportunity to spearhead the Shenandoah Valley Railroad, which would begin in Roanoke, Virginia and wind through the Shenandoah Valley to Hagerstown, Maryland. Milnes&#x27; persistence led to the Shenandoah Valley Railroad being built along with the installation of a telegraph line. The town is now rich in railroad history.

Through the work of William Milnes, Shenandoah became the midpoint between Roanoke, Virginia and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and enabled town industries to ship out their goods through means other than the river. Milnes took advantage of the railroad&#x27;s presence and erected the Big Gem Cast Iron Furnace. The Big Gem was completed in 1882 and produced 110 tons of iron ore per day. It became a popular tourist destination as well because of the sparks that could be viewed each night as red hot cinder was poured down the cinder bank. The Big Gem literally lit up the entire town.

On June 27, 1882, the post office name was changed from Shenandoah Iron Works to Milnes in honor of William Milnes. The town also became incorporated on February 12, 1884, by an Act of the General Assembly. The town name was also changed to Milnes.

The railroad tracks that were built paralleled the river flood plain and Front Street, which is now modern day First Street. The area in and around Front Street became the town&#x27;s commercial hub as business were constructed facing the rail yard. Front Street became a thriving &quot;Main St. Community,&quot; as hundreds of people would come to the downtown to shop and watch the trains pass by. In 1957, however, Norfolk and Western Railroad closed its major maintenance and operations facilities along the Front Street corridor. Since this time, only a handful of businesses remain, and buildings have deteriorated. The only thing that remains is the aura of the &quot;good old days.&quot; In 1890, the town name was changed from Milnes to Shenandoah City by an Act of the General Assembly. Since this time, the town has parted with the City portion of the name.

The year of 1890 also was the year of another great &quot;Boom&quot; as Shenandoah experienced a period of rapid growth. The Shenandoah Land and Improvement Company bought land around town and surveyed the corporate limits. Streets were staked and a map of the town was produced. Many buildings were erected during this period of growth by the Shenandoah Land and Improvement Company. Most of the structures that were built by the Land and Improvement Company are no longer visible due to fires which are also a distinct feature of the town&#x27;s history.

===20th century===
Between 1890 and 1907, depression swept through the entire country. This depression affected Shenandoah as businesses closed and went bankrupt. Others, such as the luxurious town hotel, &quot;The Shenandoah,&quot; were destroyed by a fire in 1891. Floods in 1896 washed away the river bridge, and yet another fire destroyed the town bank.

In 1907, the Big Gem Furnace discontinued operations and parts of the land were sold off. The Big Gem was dismantled in 1917 and the land passed ownership to the Lukens Steel Company who donated the land to the town on September 27, 1995. The land, , became the site of an outdoor recreational park which was named &quot;Big Gem Park&quot; after the Big Gem Furnace.

Since the railroad downgraded its facilities along First St. in 1957, the downtown has remained dormant. Most of the town&#x27;s growth has occurred along the Route 340 corridor, which runs the entire length of Page County. Currently, the town has plans to revitalize Shenandoah, which like most other small, rural towns in America, suffered from the popularity of strip malls and the development of large shopping centers. The town would like to revive &quot;Old Front Street,&quot; develop the Big Gem Furnace tract, and play on its rich railroad history and proximity to such popular tourist destinations as Luray Caverns, Massanutten Resort, and the Shenandoah National Park.

===21st century===
Shenandoah&#x27;s downtown was hit by a fire on May 23, 2006. Two stores and one residential building were destroyed. The inferno raged for over 18 hours despite seven fire companies&#x27; efforts to battle the blaze.

A second large fire struck the downtown area on March 27, 2007. Again, seven fire companies responded to the fire that burned for nearly ten hours. Three structures were destroyed and four were damaged.

The Commonwealth of Virginia gave the town numerous grants for the beautification of its once-destroyed Main Street (First Street) area. The Page County Board of Supervisors agreed to accept a $7.8 million state grant application on September 9, 2021, aimed at bringing wireless broadband to every home in the county. Previously, Shenandoah was the only town in Page County to have wireless broadband.

The Shenandoah Historic District, Shenandoah Land and Improvement Company Office, Strickley-Louderback House, and Welfley-Shuler House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

As of 2017, Norfolk Southern owns a large railyard across from First Street. On a typical day, 10 to 15 trains can be seen in the yard. On the north end of the yard, there are remains of the old Norfolk and Western shops. These shops were abandoned in the late due to the switch to diesel locomotives.

<text>Patrick Springs is a census-designated place (CDP) in Patrick County, Virginia, United States. The population was 1,845 at the 2010 census.

==History==
In 1857, the area&#x27;s first post office was operated as Spabrook Station in the vicinity of the old Patrick Springs hotel and mineral resort. Spabrooke Station was named Patrick Springs post office in 1859. A second post office was operated on Route 680 just north of old Route 58 and was called Shuff post office.

Shuff was the phonetic spelling of &quot;Shough&quot;, the surname of Reverend Jacob Shough, a highly respected Methodist circuit rider and one of the early founders of the Patrick Springs area. In 1894, the residents named the community and post office &quot;Shuff&quot; in his honor. Reverend Shough ran a store and post office combination as well as building the old Shough grist mill, one of the community&#x27;s oldest landmarks. The old Shough mill was operated by four generations of the Shough family, before it stopping operating in 1918.

The Patrick Springs post office was discontinued in 1875, then re-opened in 1907. During the 32 years the Patrick Springs was closed, Shuff Post Office handled all the mail for the area. Passengers of the Danville and Western Railway &quot;Dick &amp; Willie&quot; would pass by the Shuff depot and post office on their way to the old Patrick Springs hotel and mineral resort. Having two sets of local addresses caused confusion, and in 1925, legislative steps were taken to give the whole area, post office, and train depot the name &quot;Patrick Springs&quot;.

<text>Stuart is a town in Patrick County, Virginia, United States, where it is the county seat. The population was 1,408 at the 2010 census. The town of Stuart was named after Confederate Gen. J.E.B. Stuart, of nearby Ararat, Virginia.

==History==

===Incorporation (1753–1830)===

The Town of Stuart was first incorporated as Taylorsville, Virginia, in 1792, in honor of early settler George Taylor. Stuart has been the county seat of Patrick County since 1791, when the county was organized from territory of Henry County, Virginia. Captain Eliphaz Shelton of the Patrick County Revolutionary War Militia, donated the land for the construction of a new courthouse and town subdivided from his plantation. The Patrick County Courthouse was built in the center of the town. What is now designated as the Stuart Uptown Historic District encompasses the historic core of the county seat. It includes government, financial, religious, and commercial buildings dating from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries.

===Antebellum (1831–1860)===
By 1850, Taylorsville had grown to include approximately 50 dwellings and businesses. The 1850 census reported 18 households with 50 adults (including 29 boarders) and 60 children living in the area of the courthouse. Occupations listed included four farmers, two innkeepers, three merchants, attorneys, two physicians, two cabinetmakers, two saddlers, one harness maker, three tailors, one bricklayer, nine laborers, a clerk, a mail carrier, and a sheriff with two deputies. The Danville and Wytheville Turnpike, the predecessor to the present-day U.S. Route 58, was established in the 1850s. In 1848, the Richmond and Danville Railroad was chartered, and tracks were completed to Danville by 1856.

===Civil War, reconstruction and growth (1860–1916)===

Following the economic difficulties of the Civil War, the residents of Taylorsville focused their energies on expanding railroads to connect to markets and boost the economy. The Danville and New River Railroad was chartered in 1873, with the line completed to Martinsville, Virginia in nearby Henry County by 1881. In 1883, citizens of Patrick County approved a bond of $150,000 to expand the line. The first train pulled into Taylorsville in August 1884. With the growth associated with the railroad, Taylorsville was incorporated as a town in 1884 and was renamed Stuart in honor of Confederate Major General J.E.B. Stuart, who was born 20 miles west of town in Ararat, Virginia.

Following the completion of the railroad, the town of Stuart continued to grow steadily. The population increased 25% from 300 in 1884 to 371 in 1900. While occupations continued to center around the courthouse functions and the typical needs of a trading center, the 1900 census reflects the influence of the railroad by recording four railroad employees, eight salesmen, one insurance agent, one mining engineer, and one timber dealer. Five teachers, three hotels, two druggists, and two bartenders also indicate the growth of the town. The construction of the railroad led to the distinction of &quot;uptown&quot; and &quot;downtown&quot; Stuart. The original courthouse village was situated at the crest of a hill. An industrial and commercial area developed adjacent to the railroad, which was located further downhill along the flats of the Mayo River. &quot;Uptown&quot; continued to serve as the center of the town with the courthouse, churches, school, attorneys&#x27; offices, banks, hotels, and stores. The two areas, however, were closely related and interdependent; the town&#x27;s first telephone line at the turn of the twentieth century was run between the railroad depot downtown and the Hotel Perkins uptown.
===World War I to World War II (1917–1945)===
Before 1915, no public water or sewer system was available. People gained their drinking water from private wells or from nearby springs. There were no streetlights, and oil lamps were used for interior lighting, the roads were unpaved and the sidewalks were wooden. After the water system was installed, it was well received. By 1926 the population of the town had increased so much that improvements needed to be made.

In 1916, the Clark Power and Light Company established the first electric light system in Stuart. Each customer was charged a flat rate of $1.25 per month, and if 300 citizens bought into the system, Clark would allow the lights to burn all night. The Stuart Power and Light Company bought them out, and they were sold to the Virginia East Coast Utilities Company. In 1938, during the Great Depression, the Appalachian Electric Power Company bought them out. Joseph H. Vipperman, a Stuart native, was the president of this company when its name was changed to American Electric Power. The first telegraph was installed in Stuart with completion of the railroad here in 1884.

Reportedly the first telephone was operated at the Hotel Perkins. By 1923, ten lines served the county, each with a central; the Stuart central was located in the home of Walter S. Gilbert. In 1937, the Lee Telephone Company acquired all the private lines. In 1974, the Central Telephone Company of Virginia bought out the Lee Company. Years later Sprint/Centel bought them out and now Centurylink serves Patrick County.

Travel to Stuart was difficult until the first hard-paved road reached Stuart from Martinsville in 1925. In 1929, a nine-mile stretch from Stuart to the North Carolina state line south was paved and improved. In 1930, the three miles to Cruzes (Cruises) Store was paved, and in 1932, the road was extended to Hillsville, Virginia. Today, State Routes 8 and U.S. Route 58 serve the town and the county, and other counties along its east-to-west stretch. Route 58 is a four-lane divided highway, crossing the entire Commonwealth, as well as Patrick County.

By 1940, the population of Stuart had increased to 600 and the majority of the buildings standing today had been constructed. The Patrick County Bank (established in 1890 and later merged with the Bank of Stuart in 1926) constructed its large Classical building directly across from the courthouse in 1911. The two uptown churches, Stuart United Methodist Church and the Stuart Baptist Church, constructed their present-day structures in the early twentieth-century.


===Present day===

Stuart is a town for all age groups. It has a burgeoning downtown and recent retail developments along the Highway 58 corridor. New additions include the downtown rail trail along the Mayo River, a new Farmer&#x27;s Market located within the heart of town, and new sidewalk and infrastructure improvements along Main Street.

The Stuart Uptown Historic District, Goblintown Mill, and Patrick County Courthouse are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Chatham is a town in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, United States. It is the county seat of Pittsylvania County. Chatham&#x27;s population was 1,232 at the 2020 census. It is included in the Danville, Virginia metropolitan area. The town was originally called Competition, but the name was changed to Chatham by the Virginia General Assembly on May 1, 1852.

Chatham is home to Chatham High School, Hargrave Military Academy, and Chatham Hall, an all-female boarding high school.

==History==

It is the home to the oldest continually used building in Pittsylvania County, once an 18th-century tavern, since turned into a house and now occupied by Chatham Hall faculty.
Chatham is the county seat for Pittsylvania County and has held that status since 1777. There is a large U.S. Department of Agriculture office to support farmers in the area and a small branch office of the U.S. Forest Service. Virginia has built a new state prison at the site of an old work-release camp; this led to infrastructure upgrades in fire and water services to support the increased population.

Chatham did not see any battle action during the Civil War although it is between Richmond, the capital of the Confederacy, and Danville, which contained Confederate prisons for captured Union soldiers. On Confederate Memorial Day each year, the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy places flowers at the statue of a Confederate soldier which is prominent in the front of the historic Pittsylvania County Court House. There is a walking tour of this downtown historic district and a brochure for this is available at the Town Hall, or at the Historical Society building next to Town Hall. There are several bed &amp; breakfast establishments located on Main Street in historic Greek Revival homes.

<text>Hampden Sydney is a census-designated place (CDP) in Prince Edward County, Virginia, United States. The population was 1,450 at the 2010 census.

Hampden Sydney is the home of Hampden–Sydney College, a private all-male college that is the tenth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States.

==Geography==
Hampden Sydney is located at (37.244067, −78.476032).

According to the United States Census Bureau, in 2000 the CDP had a total area of 4.4 square miles (11.6 km2), all of it land. According to the United States Census Bureau in 2010, it had a total area of 3.895 square miles (10.087 km2) with 3.878 square miles (10.044 km2) of land and 0.017 square miles (0.043 km2) of water.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2010, there were 1,450 people, 172 households, and 108 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 322.2 people per square mile (126.1/km2). There were 197 housing units at an average density of 43.7/sq mi (17.1/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 85.4% White, 11.7% African American, 0.8% Asian, and 1.0% from two or more races.

<doc id="137717" wikidata="Q1376750" url="?curid=137717" title="Fort Gregg-Adams">
<text>Fort Gregg-Adams, in Prince George County, Virginia is a United States Army post and headquarters of the United States Army Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM)/ Sustainment Center of Excellence (SCoE), the U.S. Army Quartermaster School, the U.S. Army Ordnance School, the U.S. Army Transportation School, the Army Sustainment University (ALU), Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), and the U.S. Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA).

Fort Gregg-Adams also hosts two Army museums (the U.S. Army Quartermaster Museum and the U.S. Army Women&#x27;s Museum), a Military Entrance Processing Command station, and the vocational training schools for culinary specialists in the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy. The equipment and other materiel associated with the Army&#x27;s Ordnance Museum was moved to Fort Gregg-Adams in 2009 and 2010 for use by the United States Army Ordnance Training and Heritage Center.

Fort Gregg-Adams is a census-designated place (CDP) with a population of 9,874 as of the 2020 census – nearly triple the size of the 2010 census count.

==Etymology==

The installation was initially named Camp Lee (changed to Fort Lee in 1950) after Robert E. Lee, a Confederate general. It was one of the U.S. Army installations named for Confederate soldiers that the U.S. Naming Commission had recommended be renamed. On 8 August 2022, the commission proposed the name be changed to Fort Gregg-Adams, after Lieutenant General Arthur J. Gregg and Lieutenant Colonel Charity Adams Earley. On 6 October 2022, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin accepted the recommendation and directed the name change occur no later than 1 January 2024. On 5 January 2023, William A. LaPlante, US under-secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, directed the full implementation of the recommendations. On 27 April 2023, the post was redesignated Fort Gregg-Adams. It is the first U.S. military base to be named for African Americans.

== History ==
=== World War I ===

Just 18 days after a state of war with Germany was declared, the first Camp Lee was established as a state mobilization camp and later became a division training camp.

Camp Lee was the mobilization center for the 80th Division, the Blue Ridge Division. Because of significant common heritage in the past (Colonial Wars, Revolutionary War, and Civil War), residents of Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia became the structure of the 80th Division. The 80th Division was organized in August 1917 at Camp Lee, Virginia. The units were made up mostly of men from the above three states.

Before long, Camp Lee became one of the largest &quot;cities&quot; in Virginia. More than 60,000 Doughboys trained here prior to their departure for the Western Front and fighting in France and Germany. Included among the many facilities here was a large camp hospital situated on 58 acres of land. One of the more trying times for the hospital staff was when the worldwide influenza epidemic reached Camp Lee in the fall of 1918. An estimated 10,000 Soldiers were stricken by flu. Nearly 700 of them died during a couple of weeks.

In June 1917, building began and within sixty days some 14,000 men were on the installation. The post was home to the 155th Depot Brigade. The role of depot brigades was to receive recruits and draftees, then organize them and provide them with uniforms, equipment and initial military training. Depot brigades also received soldiers returning home at the end of the war and carried out their mustering out and discharges. When construction work ended, there were accommodations for 60,335 men.

In 1920 Camp Lee was still active, as the US 1920 Census showed many soldiers still stationed there. After World War I, Camp Lee was taken over by the Commonwealth of Virginia and designated a game preserve. Later, portions of the land were incorporated into the Petersburg National Battlefield and the Federal Correctional Institution, Petersburg. In 1921, the camp was formally closed, and its buildings were torn down, all save one – the so-called &quot;White House&quot;. During the war, this two-story wood-framed structure served as 80th Division Headquarters and as temporary residence for its Commander, Major General Adelbert Cronkhite. Years later, it became known as the &quot;Davis House&quot; in honor of the family that lived there in the 1930s and 40s.

=== World War II ===

In October 1940, the War Department ordered the construction of another Camp Lee on the site of the earlier installation. Built as rapidly as the first, construction was still ongoing when the Quartermaster Replacement Training Center (QMRTC) started operation in February 1941. Their number grew to 25,000 in 1942, and peaked at 35,000 in 1944.

While the QMRTC was getting underway, the Quartermaster School was transferred to Camp Lee. In October 1941 (two months before Pearl Harbor), the Quartermaster School moved from Philadelphia to Camp Lee to begin training Officers and Non-Commissioned officers in the art of military supply and service. A full program of courses was conducted, including Officer Candidate School. By the end of 1941, Camp Lee was the center of both basic and advanced training of Quartermaster personnel and held this position throughout the war.

Over the course of the war, Camp Lee&#x27;s population continued to mushroom until it became, in effect, the third largest &quot;city&quot; in Virginia, after Norfolk and Richmond. More than 50,000 officers attended Quartermaster Officer Candidate School. Over 300,000 Quartermaster Soldiers trained here during the war. There was a Regional Hospital with scores of pavilions and literally miles of interlocking corridors capable of housing over 2,000 patients at a time. Here too was located the Army Services Forces Training Center, the Quartermaster (Research &amp; Development) Board, a Women&#x27;s Army Corps training center, and for a while, a prisoner of war camp and the Medical Replacement Training Center. Camp Lee enjoyed a reputation as one of the most effective and best-run military installations in the country.

Camp Lee was also the home of a Medical Replacement Training Center (MRTC), but as the Quartermaster training increased, it was decided to relocate the MRTC to Camp Pickett. Later, the QMRTC was re-designated as an Army Services Forces Training Center, but it retained its basic mission of training Quartermaster personnel.

=== Post–World War II era ===
==== 1945–1950 ====
In 1946, the War Department announced that Camp Lee would be retained as the center for quartermaster training in the Army. The Quartermaster School continued operation, and in 1947, the Adjutant General&#x27;s School moved here and remained until 1951.

The Women&#x27;s Army Corps likewise established its premier training center here from 1948 to 1954. Also in 1948, the first permanent brick and mortar structure—the Post Theater (Powhatan Beaty Theater)—was constructed.

=== 1950–1965: Cold War Era growth ===
During the Korean War (1950–1953), tens of thousands of soldiers arrived at Fort Lee to receive logistics training before heading overseas. Official recognition of its permanent status was obtained in 1950 and the post was redesignated Fort Lee.

After the Korean War, progress was made on an ambitious permanent building program.

==== Air Force SAGE site ====
In 1956, the Fort Lee Air Force Station on post was selected for a Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system direction center (DC) site, designated DC-04. The four-story block house was built to house two parallel AN/FSQ-7 Computers that could receive inputs from sensors on the East Coast and provide actionable information on incoming Soviet air threats. 
* On 1 December 1956 the 4625th Air Defense Wing (SAGE) was activated. 
* On 8 January 1957 the 4625th was redesignated as the newly activated Washington Air Defense Sector at Fort Lee. 
* The WaADS was initially assigned to the 85th Air Division but on 1 September 1958 it was transferred to the 26th Air Division. 
* In February 1959 the new Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Direction Center (DC-04) became operational and oversaw Washington Air Defense Sector operations. The day-to-day operations of the command were to train and maintain tactical units flying jet interceptor aircraft (F-101 Voodoo; F-102 Delta Dagger; F-106 Delta Dart) or interceptor missiles (CIM-10 Bomarc) in a state of readiness with training missions and series of exercises with Strategic Air Command and other units simulating interceptions of incoming Soviet aircraft.

==== First permanent structures built ====
The 1950s and 1960s witnessed almost nonstop modernization efforts as, one-by-one, Fort Lee&#x27;s temporary wooden barracks, training facilities and housing units began giving way to permanent brick and cinderblock structures. New multi-storied barracks were built in the mid-50s, along with whole communities of Capehart housing for permanent party. In May 1961, the new three-story Quartermaster School, Mifflin Hall, was dedicated. Kenner Army Hospital opened in 1962, replacing the remnants of the old WWII-era facility, and the privately funded Quartermaster Museum opened its doors in 1963. Some years have seen far more change than others, but the overall process of modernization has continued ever since.

==== Locus for Quartermaster Training ====
The Quartermaster Training Center, created to supervise the training of Quartermaster personnel and troop units, brought an intensification of training activity within the Quartermaster Corps. As a result, the courses formerly taught at other locations were incorporated in the curriculum of the Quartermaster School.

Profound changes were evident at Fort Lee during 1962. The post became a Class 1 military installation under Second United States Army. The Quartermaster School became a part of the Continental Army Command service school system and was also selected to serve as the home of the Quartermaster Corps. The Second United States Army was inactivated at Fort Lee in 1966 until its reactivation at Fort Gillem, Georgia in 1983.

=== 1965–1990: Vietnam War and aftermath: Consolidation of Logistics under TRADOC ===

The rapid logistics buildup in Vietnam after 1965 signaled an urgent need for many more soldiers in the Quartermaster Corps. Fort Lee responded by going into overdrive. For a time, the school maintained three shifts, and round-the-clock training. A Quartermaster Officer Candidate School opened in 1966 for the first time since World War II. A mock Vietnamese &quot;village&quot; was created on post to familiarize trainees with guerrilla tactics and the conditions in which they could expect to fight in the jungles of Southeast Asia. Part of the sixties-era Quartermaster training program also saw the first widespread local use of automated data processing equipment.

In July 1973, Fort Lee came under the control of U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command. Additionally, the U.S. Army Logistics Center was established in 1973 to serve as an &quot;integrating center&quot; for the Quartermaster, Transportation, Ordnance, and Missile and Munitions Centers and Schools – the traditional Combat Service Support branches.

Again in 1990, there was a post reorganization and restructuring and the U.S. Army Logistics Center was re-designated the U.S. Army Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM), and the CASCOM Commander became the Fort Lee Installation Commander as well.

=== 2001–2020: 9/11, BRAC, and Sustainment Center of Excellence ===
In May 2001, the U.S. Army Women&#x27;s Museum (AWM) relocated to Fort Lee. It offered more than 13,000 sq. feet of gallery space and thousands of artifacts used to tell the long, proud history of women in the Army. Additionally, the installation hosted a growing number of tenant activities such as the Army Logistics Management Center (ALMC), Readiness Group Lee, Materiel Systems Analysis Activity, the General Leonard T. Gerow U.S. Army Reserve Center, the Defense Commissary Agency (DECA), USAR 80th Division, and several other Department of Army and Department of Defense activities.

==== Base Realignment and Closure 2005 ====

In 2005, the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) law was passed by Congress. One of BRAC&#x27;s requirements was the relocation of the United States Army Ordnance Corps headquarters, the United States Army Ordnance Munitions and Electronic Maintenance School (OMMS) from Aberdeen Proving Ground, the United States Army Ordnance Munitions and Electronic Maintenance School (OMEMS) from Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, and the Ordnance Museum to Fort Gregg-Adams by September 2011. The transfer of artifacts from Aberdeen to Fort Gregg-Adams began in August 2009, with the former museum now designated the U.S. Army Ordnance Training and Heritage Center at Fort Gregg-Adams. Also, the headquarters of the U.S. Army Transportation Center and School from Fort Eustis was brought to the installation.

One of the principal parts of BRAC was the Sustainment Center of Excellence (SCoE) headquarters building project. In the summer of 2007, there was a ground-breaking ceremony on Sergeant Seay Field, the site of the new facility. The SCoE headquarters took 18 months to build and was formally dedicated in January 2009. It now houses the Combined Arms Support Command and command groups for the Quartermaster, Ordnance, and Transportation Corps. During a ceremony on 30 July 2010, the old CASCOM headquarters was officially retired, and the new building was proudly rededicated as &quot;Mifflin Hall&quot;. To help make way for the structure, the First Logistical Command Memorial – which had been located on that site since 1974 – was carefully unmoored and moved to a more prominent spot facing the main post entrance.

In addition, a new U.S. Army Logistics University was built and opened in July 2009 to centralize basic and advanced NCO, warrant officer, commissioned officer and government civilian leadership training for all Army sustainment branches. The 400,000-square-foot building now offers more than 200 courses and trains upward of 2,300 military and civilian students daily. Its International Studies program is attended by military personnel from more than 30 allied countries.

Fort Gregg-Adams is the country&#x27;s first army post to host a &#x27;full-size&#x27; statue commemorating the service of women in the Army. The statue was unveiled in 2013.

The installation emerged as the center of logistics and sustainment for the U.S. Army. With the completion of the BRAC construction projects, the installation acquired 6.5 million square feet of new facilities and about 70,000 troops now train here each year. In 2017, the post marked its Centennial with a year-long celebration themed &quot;A Century of Support to the Nation.&quot;

=== 2020s: Operation Allies Refuge and name change from Fort Lee to Fort Gregg-Adams ===
In July 2021, the post was tasked to support Operation Allies Refuge, with a goal of helping Afghan evacuees transition to a new life in the United States at the conclusion of the war in Afghanistan. Post leaders assembled a group called &quot;Task Force Eagle&quot;, which spent the next four months supporting OAR. The Department of Defense, through U.S. Northern Command, and in support of the Department of State and Department of Homeland Security, provided transportation, temporary housing, medical screening and general support for Afghan evacuees at military facilities across the country.

The mission was to support vulnerable Afghans and their families while they finished processing with immigration services, applied for work authorizations and underwent medical care prior to resettlement in the U.S. Fort Gregg-Adams (then Fort Lee) was the first of eight installations selected to provide temporary lodging and other living needs for the Afghan evacuees. The post was initially identified by the U.S. Army as an east coast location that could quickly be used to provide temporary housing for Afghans and their families to finish administrative checks and undergo the necessary medical exams to qualify for a Special Immigrant Visa. Over 3,000 of them were temporarily housed on post by the end of November 2021 when the mission was concluded.

==== Renamed to Fort Gregg-Adams ====
On 27 April 2023 during a redesignation ceremony the name of Fort Lee was changed to Fort Gregg-Adams which is named after two African American officers Lt. Gen. Arthur J. Gregg and Lt. Col. Charity Adams. The name change was recommended by the Commission on the Naming of Items of the Department of Defense as part of the renaming of military assets which were associated with the Confederate States of America. The naming of Fort Gregg-Adams is notable as it is the first time since 1900 where a fort has been named after a service member who is still alive. It is also the first named for African Americans.

Other infrastructure on the base had been renamed including the street signs along the former Lee Avenue, now Gregg Avenue, and the signage for the Gregg-Adams Officers&#x27; Club on base, into which notably Lt. Gen. Arthur Gregg had been denied entrance back in 1950 as a young Second Lieutenant, at a time when discrimination and segregation were still being practiced against African American Uniformed Personnel, even against an executive order to the contrary, signed by President Harry S. Truman two years prior.

<text>Dale City is a census-designated place (CDP) in Prince William County, Virginia, United States, located south west of Washington, D.C. It is an annex of Woodbridge, Virginia. As of 2020, the total population was 72,088.

The community is roughly bounded by Hoadly Road to the northwest, Prince William Parkway to the north, Smoketown Road to the northeast, Gideon Drive to the east, and Cardinal Drive to the south.

== History ==
Dale City was the idea of a real estate developer, Cecil Don Hylton, who chose the term because it aptly describes the &quot;hills and dales&quot; of the rolling Virginia Piedmont, where he developed the community. Hylton began his career as a &quot;huckster&quot;, a young man who sold farm goods and produce at the farmers&#x27; market in Washington, DC. He later began a sod business after several requests from his regular clients. He ran several dozen trucks and pioneered new technologies in the industry. After the post-war housing boom, he moved into homebuilding. Throughout his career, he constructed apartments, commercial shopping centers, and over 22,000 homes. Along the way, he began his own sewer company, Dale Service Company, as well as the first cable television companies in Prince William County.

His company, Hylton Enterprises, began Dale City in 1960 approximately 1 mile east of Interstate 95 and continued to build west towards Hoadly Road (State Route 642). By 1969, the first six communities were completed. Many more were added in the 1970s and 1980s.

Several places in Dale City are named after Hylton, such as C.D. Hylton High School and the Hylton Memorial Chapel. More recently, the Hylton Foundation underwrote a major new addition to Potomac Hospital in nearby Woodbridge. Hylton&#x27;s companies have branched into new markets, especially real estate of existing houses. Hylton Realty now sells property in and near Dale City. Hylton Enterprises manages commercial properties still controlled by the Hylton family, including several shopping centers, as well as several oddly-shaped parcels of unimproved land. These parcels were land that could not be built on or were proffered to the county; Andrew Leitch Park is one such parcel that has been given to the local Park Authority.

Because Dale City was built before most of eastern Prince William County was developed, it has its own water and sewer systems, separate from the ones in Occoquan, Woodbridge, Dumfries, Triangle, and Lake Ridge. Water service is provided by Virginia-American Water Company, and since 2013, Virginia-American also provides sewer service to Dale City through their purchase of the Dale Service Corporation.

Russell House and Store is a historic early 19th century building, located on Minnieville Road.

==Communities==
Each of the communities (often referred to as neighborhoods) ends in &#x27;dale&#x27;. The streets along Dale Boulevard (generally) proceed alphabetically when followed from east to west starting from Gideon Dr. and ending at Hoadly Rd.: Ashdale, Barksdale, Birchdale, Cherrydale, Cloverdale, Darbydale, Emberdale, Evansdale, Forestdale, Glendale, Hillendale, Kerrydale, Kirkdale, Lindendale (which includes Surrydale Ct.), Mapledale, Nottingdale, Orangedale, Princedale, Queensdale, Ridgedale, Silverdale, and Trentdale. Most street names in each neighborhood begin with the first letter of the neighborhood.

==Attractions and culture==
Dale City is near Potomac Mills Mall, the second largest shopping mall in Northern Virginia, and the largest outlet mall in the United States.

Across from the Nottingdale and next to the Mapledale communities is Andrew Leitch Park, which includes a water park.

<text>Monte Carlo ( , ; , ; or colloquially , ; , ; ) is an official administrative area of Monaco, specifically the ward of Monte Carlo/Spélugues, where the Monte Carlo Casino is located. Informally, the name also refers to a larger district, the Monte Carlo Quarter (corresponding to the former municipality of Monte Carlo), which besides Monte Carlo/Spélugues also includes the wards of La Rousse/Saint Roman, Larvotto/Bas Moulins and Saint Michel. The permanent population of the ward of Monte Carlo is about 3,500, while that of the quarter is about 15,000. Monaco has four traditional quarters, from west to east they are: Fontvieille (the newest), Monaco-Ville (the oldest), La Condamine, and Monte Carlo.

Monte Carlo is situated on a prominent escarpment at the base of the Maritime Alps along the French Riviera. Near the quarter&#x27;s western end is the &quot;world-famous Place du Casino, the gambling center ... that has made Monte Carlo an international byword for the extravagant display and reckless dispersal of wealth&quot;. It is also the location of the Hôtel de Paris, Café de Paris and Salle Garnier (the casino theatre which is the home of the Opéra de Monte-Carlo). The quarter&#x27;s eastern part includes the community of Larvotto with Monaco&#x27;s only public beach, as well as its new convention center (the Grimaldi Forum), and the Monte-Carlo Bay Hotel &amp; Resort. At the quarter&#x27;s eastern border, one crosses into the French town of Beausoleil (sometimes referred to as Monte-Carlo-Supérieur), and to its east is the western border of Italy.

==History==
In 1856, Charles III of Monaco granted a concession to Napoleon Langlois and Albert Aubert, to establish a sea-bathing facility for the treatment of various diseases, and to build a German-style casino.
The initial casino opened in La Condamine in 1862, but was unsuccessful. It relocated several times, before reaching its present location in the &quot;Les Spélugues&quot; (The Caves) area of Monte Carlo. Success came slowly, largely because Monaco was inaccessible from much of Europe. The railway, installed in 1868, brought with it an influx of people, and Monte Carlo grew in wealth.

Saint-Charles Church on Monte Carlo&#x27;s Avenue Sainte-Charles was completed in 1883. It was restored in its centenary year.

The municipality of Monte Carlo was created in 1911, when the constitution divided the principality of Monaco into three municipalities. Monte Carlo encompassed the existing neighborhoods of La Rousse/Saint Roman, Larvotto/Bas Moulins, and Saint Michel. The municipalities merged in 1917, after accusations that the government used them to &quot;divide and conquer&quot;. Since then, they became wards. Today, Monaco is divided into 9 wards, which are grouped into 4 quartiers.

The quarter of Monte Carlo was served by tramways from 1898 to 1931. It linked all parts of Monaco (see transportation in Monaco). In 2003 a new cruise ship pier was completed in the harbour at Monte Carlo.

== Geography ==
Monte Carlo has an area of 28.14 hectares (0.28 square kilometers or 69.19 acres) and faces the Mediterranean Sea, bordered to the west by Ravin de Sainte-Dévote and La Condamine, and to the east by La Rousse and Larvotto.

=== Climate ===
Monte Carlo has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csa), which is influenced by oceanic climate and humid subtropical climate. As a result, it has warm, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. 


==Sport==

Monte Carlo is home to an ATP Masters 1000 tennis tournament during the clay court season usually played during the end of March through mid to late April. Monte Carlo is a popular tax haven for many tennis professionals and home to many active and retired athletes. 
Monte Carlo is host to most of the Circuit de Monaco, on which the Formula One Monaco Grand Prix takes place. It also hosts world championship boxing bouts, the European Poker Tour Grand Final and the World Backgammon Championship as well as the Monaco International Auto Show (Fr: Salon International de l&#x27;Automobile de Monaco), fashion shows and other events. Although the Monte Carlo Masters tennis tournament is billed as taking place in the community, its actual location is in the adjacent French commune of Roquebrune-Cap-Martin. The Monte Carlo Rally is one of the longest running and most respected car rallies; from 1973 to 2008 and again from 2012, it marks the start of World Rally Championship season, having also served as the curtain-raiser for the Intercontinental Rally Challenge between 2009 and 2011. The rally, however, takes place outside the Monte Carlo quarter and is run mostly on French roads.

== Tourism ==
Monte Carlo has been visited by royalty as well as the public and movie stars for decades. Monte Carlo is one of Europe&#x27;s leading tourist resorts, although many of the key tourist destinations are in other parts of Monaco, including such attractions as Monaco Cathedral, the Napoleon Museum, the Oceanographic Museum and aquarium, and the Prince&#x27;s Palace, all of which are in Monaco-Ville.

===Salle Garnier===
The Opéra de Monte-Carlo or Salle Garnier was built to designs of the architect Charles Garnier, who also designed the Paris opera house now known as the Palais Garnier. Although much smaller, the Salle Garnier is very similar in style with decorations in red and gold, and frescoes and sculptures all around the auditorium. It was inaugurated on 25 January 1879 with a performance by Sarah Bernhardt dressed as a nymph. The first opera performed there was Robert Planquette&#x27;s &quot;Le Chevalier Gaston&quot; on 8 February 1879, and that was followed by three more in the first season.

Other famous twentieth-century singers to appear at Monte Carlo included Titta Ruffo, Geraldine Farrar, Mary Garden, Tito Schipa, Beniamino Gigli, Claudia Muzio, Georges Thill, and Lily Pons.

===Hôtel de Paris===

The Hôtel de Paris, established in 1864 by Charles III of Monaco, is located on the west side of the Place du Casino in the heart of Monte Carlo. It belongs to the Société des bains de mer de Monaco (SBM), and is part of the elite Palace Grand Hotels in Monaco with the Hotel Hermitage, the Monte-Carlo Beach Hotel, Monte-Carlo Bay Hotel &amp; Resort, the Hotel Metropole and Fairmont hotel.

The hotel has 106 rooms divided into four groups based on type of view, decoration and luxury. The Exclusive City View offers 20 rooms, the Superior Courtyard has 29 large rooms, the Exclusive Sea View 59 and the Exclusive Casino has six.

Additionally, there are 74 suites and junior suites which are grouped similarly, offering more luxury than the rooms. There are single and double suites as well as courtyard junior suites and Sea/Casino Junior suites. There is also one Presidential suite.

In October 2014, a renovation project began, to create a garden courtyard, add a new spa, fitness and pool area, exceptional suites, and a “rooftop villa” with a private garden and pool.

<text>Dumfries, officially the Town of Dumfries, is a town in Prince William County, Virginia. The population was 4,961 at the 2010 United States census.

==Geography==
Dumfries is located at (38.567853, −77.324591).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.6 square miles (4.1 km2), all of it land. The town is situated 70 miles north of the state capital, Richmond. It is 30 miles south of central Washington, D.C.

==History==
The history of Dumfries began as early as 1690 when Richard Gibson erected a gristmill on Quantico Creek. A customhouse and warehouse followed in 1731, and many others cropped up along the estuary by 1732. The Town of Dumfries was formally established on of land at the head of the harbor of Quantico Creek, provided by John Graham. He named the town after his birthplace, Dumfries, Scotland.

After much political maneuvering, the General Assembly established Dumfries as the first of seven townships in the county. Dumfries received its charter on May 11, 1749, making it the oldest continuously chartered town in Virginia.

The Ceremonial Seal of the Town of Dumfries embodies elements of its heritage, from the period of 1651, when the first patents were issued to colonists, who following the Potomac recognized the value of a snug harbor in Quantico Creek. Thus the foundations for the establishment of a town, which in 1749 received its charter from the Colonial government in Williamsburg, Virginia.

The elements of the seal are contained within the pattern formed by the outer frame of a hawser rope or cable, and the inner frame of an anchor chain, of a type employed in ships of the Colonial era.

Within these frames are found items which are consistent with a town of maritime background. They are overlaid on a chart of the Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River, with Dumfries indicated at the head of Quantico Creek. The navigational aids of the sextant and compass rose complete the maritime motif.

The two water fowl relate to the wetlands of Quantico Creek. The dock with fishnet, pilings, ships block and line further the theme of a mercantile port of call. The thistle indicates the Scottish founders of the town, with the name of Dumfries, taken by John Graham, the founder, in honor of his home in Scotland.
The supporters of the shield are, on the left, a Piscataway brave, of the Powhatan Confederacy, the predominant tribe along the Potomac, in this area. On the right, a Colonial militiaman of 1775, when Colonel Henry Lee was company Commander. The shield in its upper quadrant, displays a sailing vessel of the period, and below the tobacco leaf, the first commodity, overlaid with shafts of wheat, the later commodity that supported the town.

When Dumfries became the second leading port in Colonial America receiving tobacco from the upland, it rivaled New York, Philadelphia and Boston. Dumfries peaked in size and importance in 1763. For about 15 years Dumfries was a thriving port when several factors brought about its demise: the Revolutionary War, erosion and siltation, and the shift in the main shipping commodity (from tobacco to wheat and sugar).

The Dumfries Cemetery contains burials of some of the Dumfries pioneers.

Alexander Henderson built a house known as the Henderson House which still stands on a hill in Dumfries, as well as owning various land in Prince William Forest Park. Alexander was a merchant when the ports were booming in Dumfries. Alexander is famous for his son, United States Marine Corps commandant Archibald Henderson.

The Leesylvania Archeological Site (44PW7), Old Hotel, and Weems-Botts Museum are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Dumfries was combined with the community of Triangle, Virginia, to form Dumfries-Triangle in the 1950 United States census. However, the two communities were separated again by the time of the 1960 census.

<text>Gainesville is a census-designated place (CDP) in western Prince William County, Virginia, United States. The population was 17,287 in the 2020 census.

== History ==
Gainesville was once a changing point for stagecoach horses on the Fauquier and Alexandria Turnpike. In earlier times, the village that became known as “Gainesville” actually had two other names, though only briefly. In the colonial era, the region was known as the &quot;Middle Grounds&quot;, a reference to its location between Broad Run and Bull Run. 

===19th century===
In the early 1800s, Samuel Love of Buckland Hall started work on the Warrenton-Alexandria Turnpike. In the hamlet where the turnpike passed through the Middle Grounds, a new stable was erected for stagecoach drivers to switch horses. Other businesses followed, and the settlement became known as New Stable. 

In 1846, a post office by that name was opened there in Richard Graham&#x27;s hotel and store. Mr. Graham also operated a large stable that catered to the drovers and stage drivers and other less pretentious travelers. The person responsible for bringing the railroad through the village was Thomas Brawner Gaines (1814-1856), who had begun buying up property in the area as early as 1835, and later became a major landowner.

In 1850, Thomas Brawner Gaines (1814-1856) sold to the Manassas Gap Railroad a right-of-way through his land along the Warrenton Turnpike (US Route 29). After the railroad was completed to Strasburg, Virginia in 1854, Gaines conveyed additional land for a train depot with the condition that the rail stop take his name. By 1856, a small community with a post office flourished around the Gainesville depot.

===20th century===
Gainesville became a shipping point for grain, timber, and cattle and remained a major cattle shipping point into the early 1960s. During the American Civil War, Gainesville was occupied by both Confederate and Union armies and nearby Thoroughfare Gap in the Bull Run Mountains served as a path for soldiers to reach the First and Second battles of Bull Run. Into the early 1940s the Southern Railway operated passenger service from Harrisonburg and Strasburg Junction through Gainesville, to Manassas and Washington&#x27;s Union Station. In 1994, the groundbreaking for Gainesville&#x27;s first townhome community began; it was named Crossroads. This marked the beginning of mass-development for Gainesville.

===21st century===
In 2006, the VDOT began working on the Gainesville Interchange improvement project, with construction officially starting in July 2011, in order to ease the traffic in the rapidly growing Gainesville-Haymarket area. It was completed on July 9, 2015.

==Development==

Major commercial and residential development has taken place since 2000, resulting in Gainesville having six large shopping centers. The intersection of I-66 and Lee Highway (29 Highway) has the largest shopping center with many big box stores. 

Gainesville railway station extension for the VRE was scheduled to open in 2022, connecting the region via commuter rail to Fairfax County, Manassas, and Washington, D.C. However, the project was voted down by the VRE Operations Board in favor of expanding services to the existing station in Broad Run.

<text>Haymarket is a town in Prince William County, Virginia, United States. The population was 1,545 as of the 2020 census.

==History==

Haymarket is built on land that used to be hunting grounds of the western Iroquois nations, who came from the New York and Pennsylvania area around the Great Lakes. They used hunting paths through the land until 1722, when they made a treaty with the colonies of Virginia and New York to move into the Blue Ridge Mountain region.

Due to the hunting paths, this location, and later the town, were given the nickname &quot;The Crossroads&quot;. The town of Haymarket began to be developed and built after the American Revolutionary War, formally founded in 1799 on the land of William Skinker. The Virginia General Assembly gave Skinker the rights to lay out the town, which he drew to consist of 13 streets and 140 lots. Shortly after, a clerk&#x27;s office and jail were constructed in 1801, as the town had been selected as the site of what is now a district court. The town owed its early development to business and trade associated with the regular court sessions.

In 1807, the Virginia General Assembly abolished the district court in favor of the circuit court system, which established a court at each county seat. Until 1830 the court house remained the focal point of the town, while serving multiple purposes. In 1830, the court house was converted into and deeded as an Episcopal church; in 1833 it was consecrated as St Paul&#x27;s.

During the Civil War, on November 4, 1862, Union troops invaded Haymarket and set the entire town on fire. Only four buildings survived: three small houses and St. Paul&#x27;s Church. For the remainder of the war, Haymarket remained mostly uninhabited. A skirmish took place on October 19, 1863, involving the Second Brigade, Second Division, and Fifth Army Corps. Another skirmish took place in June 1863. They both involved Union encounters with the Confederate cavalry. Following General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s surrender, Haymarket began to recover. Slowly it regained its former prosperity and size.

===Post-Reconstruction Era to Present===
Haymarket was incorporated in 1882, the second town in Prince William County to do so. The first mayor elected was Garrett Hulfish and the first councilmen elected were T.A. Smith, Charles Jordan, and William W. Meade. In May 1882 during the council&#x27;s second meeting, the rudimentary ordinances were drafted and adopted.

On March 19, 1892, Lee Heflin and Joseph Dye were lynched in Haymarket. They had been convicted of the murder of a girl and sentenced to death, but the mob thought the legal system moved too slowly. The men were hanged from trees at the edge of woods; then the mob shot into their bodies. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said, &quot;mob law...is a dangerous thing to encourage. There is too much of it already throughout the country, and it spreads like a contagion so long as public sentiment tacitly approves it.&quot; It was unusual that white men were lynched; in Virginia and the rest of the South, usually black men were victims of lynching.

From 1882 to the present day, most of the buildings in central Haymarket have remained unchanged. The town borders U.S Route 15. Growth has occurred outside the town. While no schools are located within the town, the larger area has five schools – all part of the Prince William County School System. In the 1970s during the construction of the Interstate System, Haymarket was served by Exit 40 of Interstate 66. Being connected to the interstate, during a period of growth in the Northern Virginia region, has produced a population boom in the area of suburban development.
In 1994 The Walt Disney Company bought extensive amounts of land in Haymarket for a proposed Disney&#x27;s America theme park. Local resistance to the resort, because of perceived adverse effects on the Manassas Battlefield, resulted in the defeat of the park.

William B. Snyder, a local businessman, convinced Disney to sell the property to him. Snyder, in turn, sold off most of the land to developers, except for the donated to the National Capital Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America. It used this land to develop Camp Snyder.

In addition to St. Paul&#x27;s Church, Evergreen, Locust Bottom, Mt. Atlas, and Old Town Hall and School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="137726" wikidata="Q1374440" url="?curid=137726" title="Linton Hall, Virginia">
<text>Linton Hall is a census-designated place (CDP) in Prince William County, Virginia, United States, which includes unincorporated Bristow. The population was 35,725 at the 2010 census, an increase of over 300% from the 2000 census.

According to the United States Census Bureau, residents of Linton Hall had an average commute of 46.3 minutes each way between 2005 and 2007, the longest average commute for the period in the nation. The average commute in the United States for the period was 25.1 minutes. The chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors said commutes were especially long for residents during the period studied because the county had not finished building roads to support the new residential areas that had just been built.

==History==

The area is named for Linton Hall Military School (now Linton Hall School), a school founded by Benedictine nuns on the site of the former Linton&#x27;s Ford Plantation. Linton&#x27;s Ford was inherited by Sister Mary Baptista, John Linton&#x27;s daughter, and upon her death the land was inherited by the Benedictine order for the purpose of educating poor boys and girls. The Benedictine monastery remains part of the school through the present day.

Over the last century the Benedictine nuns sold most of the school property, primarily to real estate developers, which created the Braemar subdivision, a series of upscale housing developments with a large homeowners association.

The Linton family cemetery is located inside the Braemar subdivision. The site was surveyed by the Prince William County Archaeologist, Prince William County Historical Society and County Arborist for potential restoration in 2006. While it was the intent of the nuns at Linton Hall to maintain ownership of the cemetery, it was determined that, due to loss of land records for that space during the Civil War (attributed to the burning of the Brentsville Courthouse), the cemetery was &quot;unowned&quot; and remains in this status today.

==Geography==

==History==
Woodbridge was initially a village composed largely of plantations and later farms and industrial complexes. Formally dating to at least 1731 when Prince William County was formed out of the Stafford County, Virginia. Initially, the first Prince William County Courthouse was erected in Woodbridge owing to its location halfway between Dumfries, Virginia and Alexandria, Virginia, the two largest Cities which were then in Prince William County. With the incorporation of Fairfax County, Virginia, Woodbridge ceased to be the center of the county and municipal function eventually shifted westward into Brentsville and eventually to Manassas where it is today.

Later, the Woodbridge postal delivery area became the hub that included Dale City and Lake Ridge, which had previously been forged as a planned community in the 1960s and 1970s. The area takes its name from Thomas Mason&#x27;s 1795 wooden toll bridge built to supplant the existing ferry, carrying the King&#x27;s Highway traffic across the Occoquan River. Mason&#x27;s Woodbridge Plantation was located in the area of the present day Belmont Bay golf course community. The original bridge from which the area takes its name was washed away in 1807 following a heavy storm. Subsequently, industrial and economic development shifted toward Occoquan the next nearest river crossing. The bridge would not be replaced until the 20th century when an iron truss bridge was built. This bridge failed in 1972 during Hurricane Agnes and was eventually replaced by the current structure.

The Freestone Point Confederate Battery and Rippon Lodge are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Attractions and culture==
Woodbridge experienced its current development boom in the mid-1980s, after being a municipality composed largely of either farms or industrial complexes, as an annex of sorts of Dale City, which had been forged as a planned community in the 1960s and 1970s.

Woodbridge is home to Potomac Mills Mall (managed by Simon Property Group), one of the largest shopping centers in northern Virginia. Woodbridge is a suburban city because many of its residents are employed in nearby Washington, D.C.

Due in part to the I-95 and I-66 HOV waiver given to hybrid vehicles, many D.C. government workers have relocated to the area to take advantage of the lower-priced housing. However, in July 2006, the hybrid/HOV privilege was revoked. Vehicles registered prior to July 2006 were exempted from occupancy requirements in all (HOV) facilities in Virginia until July 1, 2009.

Other cultural resources include Rippon Lodge, the oldest house in Prince William County, which was opened as a park and museum in October 2007.

===Sports===

Woodbridge was the former home of the Potomac Nationals minor league baseball club, before their relocation to Fredericksburg. Their former stadium, the Pfitzner Stadium, is located in Woodbridge. The stadium is now the source of many community events.

On May 24, 2022, the Washington Commanders announced potential plans for a new stadium complex in Woodbridge, with plans for a new stadium, amphitheater, retail hub, and office space.

==Transportation==

Three other major routes, all of which have interchanges with I-95 and terminate at U.S. 1, are VA 123 (Gordon Boulevard), which runs north to Fairfax and ends in Arlington at the Washington, D.C. border, VA 294 (Prince William Parkway), which runs northeast to and ends in the Manassas area, and SR 784 (Dale Boulevard)—which heads northeast to Dale City and ends west of Hoadly. Other major roads in Woodbridge include SR 639 (Horner Road), SR 906 (Occoquan Road), and SR 2000 (Opitz Boulevard).

===Public transportation===

The Potomac and Rappahannock Transportation Commission (PRTC), which operates its OmniRide and OmniRide Local bus services throughout Prince William County, is headquartered in Woodbridge.

<text>The town of Washington, Virginia is a historic village located in the eastern foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains near Shenandoah National Park. The entire town is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district, Washington Historic District. It is the county seat of Rappahannock County, Virginia.

The town was established by an act of the Virginia General Assembly in 1796 and as the county seat of Rappahannock County, Virginia, in 1833. The town was incorporated in 1894 and was rechartered by the Virginia General Assembly in 1985. A large portion of the town was designated as the Washington Historic District on the Virginia Landmarks Register and the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and is considered to be the best preserved of county-seat communities in the Piedmont. The town is led by a 7-member elected Town Council composed of a mayor, a treasurer, and five other members, all of whom serve 4-year terms. The internationally recognized Inn at Little Washington is located in the town. The town combines a mixture of open spaces, residences, village commerce, tourism facilities, historic buildings, cultural offerings, and local government activities. Its population was 135 people in the 2010 census and was estimated to be 127 people in 2019. The area of the town is .

==History==
The first recorded official document relating to the land that became the town of Washington was a land grant in the year 1735 from King George II of Great Britain to Thomas, James, and Elizabeth Kennerly. The three siblings received 1,750 acres of land located &quot;between the mountains and the fork of the Rushy River,&quot; in what was then Orange County, for importing six people into the colony of Virginia, payment of seven pounds five shillings of &quot;good and lawful money,&quot; and an annual fee of one shilling for every fifty acres of land. At this time there were virtually no Native Americans in the area and the way was open to English settlement of the Piedmont region of Virginia.

In 1745, the Kennerlys divided their land into three parts. Thomas received the central part, adjacent to and south of the Rush River and containing the land that would become the town of Washington. Thomas sold his land to Henry Gambill in 1753 and moved to South Carolina. Gambill divided the land: in 1754 he sold the western part, which contained what became the western portion of the town of Washington, to John Minor; in 1761 he gave the eastern part, which contained what became the northeastern portion of the town, to his son William Gambill. The border between these two parts would become part of the original road to Chester Gap and, later, Gay Street when the town of Washington was established.

These two parts were bought and sold multiple times during the next 30 years. However, four important individuals acquired the land in the 1790s. In 1791 William Porter was given 247 acres of the western land, and in 1795 George Calvert purchased 230 acres of the adjacent eastern land. During 1792–1795, Porter sold 2 acres to James Wheeler, 2 acres to James Jett Jr., and 6 acres to George Calvert, all of which were located on land that became the town of Washington. Only a few buildings were mentioned in these deeds; these included Wheeler&#x27;s storehouse, Jett&#x27;s store, and a schoolhouse, located along the road to Chesters Gap. The rest of the land was apparently only farmland owned by Porter and by Calvert.

On November 1, 1796, George Calvert, James Jett Jr., and James Wheeler petitioned the Virginia General Assembly to &quot;establish a town by the name of Washington on twenty five acres of land of your said petitioners&quot;. The General Assembly responded by passing an act on December 14, 1796, establishing thirteen new towns in Virginia, one of which was the town of Washington. One year later, Calvert, Jett, Wheeler, and William Porter sent a second petition to the General Assembly of Virginia, asking that part of Porter&#x27;s land be added to the town. A plan of the proposed streets and lots of the town was attached to the petition; four of the six streets were named after the four petitioners. On December 25, 1797, the General Assembly approved this request.
The local legend that George Washington surveyed and laid out the town in 1749 is believed to have been created from fictitious documents in 1932.

The trustees of the new town of Washington quickly proceeded to sell the fifty-one lots of the town. In 1803 Mrs. Anne Cox established a tavern in the center of town; this building survives today as the gift shops of The Inn at Little Washington. Mary Resor also established a tavern, on Gay Street, which was next owned by George Thorn and later became the home &quot;Avon Hall.&quot; The Washington post office was situated in the town by 1804 and still remains in the town. The town became known as &quot;Little Washington&quot; as early as 1804, to distinguish it from the new capital of Washington, D.C. located only 70 miles to the northeast.

In 1833, Rappahannock County was created from part of Culpeper County and the town of Washington was selected to be the county seat. The courthouse and Court Clerk&#x27;s office were constructed by Malcolm F. Crawford of Albemarle County in 1833-1834 and the jail was built by John W. Fant of Shenandoah County in 1833–1836. The town was governed by a 7-member Board of Trustees. As the town prospered and grew in importance as the seat of government of Rappahannock County, new homes were constructed, and businesses were established to serve the town and the county. Two schools were created in the town to provide private education in the years before the Commonwealth of Virginia instituted public education. The Washington Presbyterian church was built in 1856–1858, Trinity Episcopal church in 1857, Washington Baptist church in 1875, the black American First Baptist church in 1881, and the Washington Methodist church in 1890. The &quot;Blue Ridge Guide&quot; newspaper served the town and the county from 1886 to 1936.

In 1894, the town was incorporated by an act of the Virginia General Assembly and governance of the town was vested in a council of seven members. The Rappahannock National Bank was established in the town in 1903, and electricity and telephones were introduced in the 1920s. Thornton&#x27;s garage was constructed in the middle of town; this became The Inn at Little Washington in 1978. Partlow&#x27;s General Store was created in the town in the early 1900s, Stuart&#x27;s merchandise store in 1908, and Lea Brothers Store in 1928. A new water system was constructed for the town in the mid-1930s through Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s Works Progress Administration, and a volunteer fire department was created at that time. In the later 1930s, caravans of tourists began visiting the town on their way to Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National Park. A major event heralded the beginning of the second half of the 20th century with the election of seven women to serve as the Town Council of Washington, replacing the seven men who had comprised the council. Nationwide publicity was given to the election and to the town (nicknamed &quot;She-town&quot; temporarily). These women accomplished a great deal to improve the ambiance and governance of the town. Over the next 50 years, the town flourished because of the influx of tourism, with many new stores, art galleries, restaurants, and overnight lodging. The weekly &quot;Rappahannock News&quot; newspaper was begun. Two performance arts theaters and a public library were established in the town.
In 1975, the town was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as &quot;Washington Historic District&quot;, and the Town Council passed an ordinance establishing a review board charged with preserving the town&#x27;s historic character. (More below.)
One of the most important events in the modern history of the town is the opening of The Inn at Little Washington in 1978. This restaurant and inn celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2018 and has gained national and international fame. It is a member of the luxury hotel association, Relais &amp; Châteaux. It is the first inn to receive the Mobil Travel Guide&#x27;s 5-Star award, and it has been rated by the American Automobile Association with 5 diamonds for its restaurant and 5 diamonds for its overnight lodging for 28 years. In 2001, the owner and chef of the Inn, Patrick O&#x27;Connell, was given the prestigious Outstanding Chef in America Award. La Liste, the French guide to the world&#x27;s best restaurants, ranked the Inn as the fifth highest rated restaurant in the world. The Inn attracts a discerning clientele from Washington, D.C., and its suburbs. Largely due to the Inn&#x27;s influence, the town is also home to several art galleries, unique shops, bed and breakfasts, and restaurants. The town attracts art lovers, history buffs, and hikers that come into the county for day hikes or weekend camping trips.

In 1985 the town was rechartered by the Virginia General Assembly. By this new charter, the town was granted much broader powers and increased responsibilities. Washington has evolved to be a safe and quiet community within the rural agricultural environment of Rappahannock County. It still has the same grid of streets and the same street names shown in the 1797 town plan. However, the 51 lots have been subdivided extensively and the boundaries of the town have been significantly enlarged, from the original 25 acres to 182.0171 acres. The town is a community without any large commercial businesses or heavy industry. It is governed by a 7-member Town Council guided by the town&#x27;s Comprehensive Plan, Planning Commission, Board of Zoning Appeals, and town ordinances.

==Washington Historic District==

&quot;Washington Historic District&quot; was added to the Virginia Landmarks Register and to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The historic district comprises the entire corporate boundaries of the town (180 acres). However, most of the historic structures are clustered within the 30-acre core of the town established in 1796–1797 by George Calvert, James Jett Jr., James Wheeler, and William Porter.

At that time, the Town Council passed a Historic District Ordinance which established a Historic District Architectural Review Board. The historic district encompassed the entire town and many properties were considered as contributing to the historic nature of the town. The Town Council&#x27;s actions were intended to protect and preserve the historic nature of the town. A resurvey of the town was conducted in 2004–2005. In 2006, an amendment was made to the town&#x27;s historic district designation, extending the period of historic significance to 1945, and the amendment was recorded on both the Virginia Landmarks Register and the National Register in 2006. A total of 159 properties are considered to contribute to the historic nature of the District. Many of the homes and other structures from the earliest period of the town survive today.
The chief landmark is the Rappahannock County Courthouse, a two-story Flemish-bond Jeffersonian-style building constructed in 1834–1835 by Malcolm F. Crawford of Albemarle County who had worked on construction of the University of Virginia and built the Page County Courthouse and Greene County Courthouse (both surviving and NRHP-listed), and also the courthouse of Spotsylvania County. Crawford also built the adjacent Court clerk&#x27;s office (now the office of the Commissioner of Revenue). Other brick buildings in the courthouse complex are the county jail (1835–1836, constructed by John W. Fant of Stafford County) and the county treasurer&#x27;s office (1857). A small frame building (1857) on the northwest corner of the complex served as the original office of the Commonwealth Attorney.

Other notable buildings include the tavern and inn originally owned by Anne Coxe (circa 1800, now commercial shops); a log building that was probably one of the original dwelling houses constructed when the town was formed in 1796–1797; the country-Gothic Trinity Episcopal church (1857) and the Doric Presbyterian church (1858, now the Town Hall), both constructed by James Leake Powers; the brick Baptist church and Masonic hall (1875); and a brick Edwardian bank building (1915, now commercial offices).

Numerous private homes are also part of the Washington Historic District, including the mansions Avon Hall (circa 1810, moved and enlarged in 1931), the Meadows (circa 1790), Mount Prospect (1872), The Maples (circa 1850, now a bed and breakfast establishment), and the home constructed for Edward Pendleton (circa 1800, now remodeled as overnight lodging for The Inn at Little Washington).  In addition to these large homes, there are many privately owned homes with historic significance throughout the Washington Historic District.

The town of Washington has been described as perhaps the best preserved of the county seat communities in the Virginia Piedmont.

==Geography==
Washington is located at (38.712914, −78.159474).

The town has a total area of , all of it land except for the Avon Hall pond.

The town is located on the eastern side of the Blue Ridge Mountains near the northern part of Shenandoah National Park.

==Highways==
The main road serving Washington is U.S. Route 211 Business/U.S. Route 522 Business. This road follows Warren Avenue, Middle Street, and Main Street through the town and is the old alignment of U.S. Route 211, which now passes just southeast of the town limits. Via US 211 and US 522, US 211 Bus/US 522 Bus provides access to Luray to the west, Culpeper to the south, Warrenton to the east and Front Royal to the north.

<text>Warsaw is an incorporated town in and the county seat of Richmond County, Virginia, United States. The population was 1,637 at the 2020 census and is estimated to be 2,330 as of 2023.

==History==
Prior to English colonization, the area of Warsaw, Virginia was occupied by a group of Rappahannock Native Americans, who would fish on the nearby creeks for shad and herring. By 1667, the Rappahannock people had been forced to sell all their land north of the Rappahannock River to English settlers, including the modern site of Warsaw.

After the division of the Old Rappahannock County in 1692, Richmond County was created. The new county had its seat at Richmond Court House, which was originally along the shores of the Rappahannock River. The site of Richmond Court House was moved inland to modern Warsaw in 1730, and the modern court house was built in 1748. The area was also the home of Robert Wormeley Carter, who represented Richmond County in the Virginia House of Burgesses and the Continental Congress as a supporter of the American Revolution; he owned the historic house of Sabine Hall, located near Richmond Court House. Additionally, the region was subjected to intense British raids during the War of 1812, and many free men of the town were rallied in its defense from the British army. During this time, the area&#x27;s economy grew reliant on tobacco, as a small group of wealthy planters grew the crop with the labor of indentured settlers and enslaved Africans.

In January 1832, the town&#x27;s name was changed to Warsaw, after the news of &quot;great uprisings in Old World Warsaw&quot; in 1830 and 1831 reached residents. This change was due to local popular support for the November Uprising in Poland. As with Richmond Court House, a number of other small towns in the United States changed their names to Warsaw at this time, such as Warsaw, Kentucky.

Following the Civil War, the area&#x27;s newly emancipated freedmen made efforts to secure their own churches and schools. Ultimately, the region&#x27;s schools and churches would be formally desegregated with the passage of the Civil Rights Act, though all schools in the region would not be fully integrated until the 1970s.

Today, Warsaw is one of many small towns in Virginia&#x27;s Northern Neck region. The town prides itself on its schools, natural beauty, and quality of life.

<doc id="137742" wikidata="Q1376339" url="?curid=137742" title="Glasgow, Virginia">
<text>Glasgow is a town in Rockbridge County, Virginia, United States, at the confluence of the James and Maury Rivers. The population was 1,052 at the 2020 census.

Glasgow has had issues with flooding, notably during Hurricane Camille in 1969. As a result of flooding concerns, the Balcony Falls Dam (just east of the confluence of the James and Maury rivers) was removed in 1973. From 2001 to 2007, the town was known for having at least a dozen fiberglass dinosaur figures along the roadside.

==History==

German explorer John Peter Salling and his brother Adam were the first Europeans to settle in what is known today as Glasgow around 1741. In December 1742, the Battle of Galudoghson between Iroquois warriors and a company of Virginia militia took place near the confluence of the James River and the Maury River. The militia captain, John McDowell, was killed, along with eight militia soldiers. Between 1760 and 1768, John Paxton II acquired most of the Salling property. Robert, Joseph, and Arthur Glasgow settled in the area in 1768. Glasgow was named after Joseph Glasgow, son of Arthur. Joseph and his wife, Nancy Ellis McCullough, built their home, known as Union Ridge, in 1823.

In 1854 Frank Padgett, a Black slave, drowned while attempting to rescue passengers stranded on a canal boat by the swollen James River. A granite obelisk monument commemorating his death stands in Glasgow&#x27;s Centennial Park.

Glasgow was established on March 5, 1890, when the Rockbridge Company held a drawing of lots. At that time only two houses, Union Ridge and the Salling home, stood in Glasgow, which then had a population of only 20 people. By 1892, the town had paved roads, streetlamps, telephone service and a 200-room hotel, the Rockbridge Hotel. The panic of 1893, however, led to an economic collapse that put the Rockbridge Company out of business. The hotel was abandoned and torn down around 1906. The Virginia Electrical Power Company (VEPCO, now Dominion Energy) built a hydroelectric plant at Balcony Falls in 1915. The plant was in operation until 1969. Citing evidence that the devastating flood of 1969 would not have been as bad if the dam were not there, citizens of Glasgow petitioned to have the dam removed in 1974. Flooding has affected the city numerous times in its history. Since the earliest recorded flood in 1877, the city was flooded in 1936, 1950, 1969, 1972, 1985, and 1995, with the floods of 1936, 1969 and 1985 being the worst.

==Geography==
Glasgow is located at (37.633093, -79.451542). Glasgow is about 6 miles east of the community of Natural Bridge, the site of the historic land bridge of the same name.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.5 square miles (4.0 km2), all of it land.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Glasgow has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

A few of the first settlers include Bratton, Lockridge, Graham, Carter, and Davis. The first Goshen council was headed in 1744 by James Patton and John Lewis.

Goshen was based on farms, much like today, raising mainly corn. While Goshen was mainly farmland, in the 1800s, Goshen Pass and Panther&#x27;s Gap was a bustling community with a school, a hotel, a post office, and foundries.

The Alleghany Hotel was built by the Goshen Improvement company, the company which in the boom period of 1890 selected Goshen station as a site for laying of and the founding of a new city. The hotel was known as the &quot;house of entertainment,&quot; but a few years before the fire, it was renamed the Alleghany Sanitarium, housing tuberculosis patients. On Thanksgiving Day, 1922, the Alleghany Hotel smoldered in flames and ash for hours before the building was completely destroyed. During this time, Goshen was without a fire department to combat the flames.

The Goshen Land Company Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

<text>Bridgewater is an incorporated town in Rockingham County, Virginia, United States. The population was 6,596 at the 2020 census. It is included in the Harrisonburg, Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
William Magill first settled along the North River in 1746, and the area became known as Magill&#x27;s Ford. 

According to the Harrisonburg-Rockingham Historical Society, the book &quot;History of Rockingham County, Virginia&quot; said John Dinkle built a carding mill there around 1810 and the settlement came to be called Dinkletown. By 1815, the Dinkle family additionally had a sawmill, stave mill, and gristmill in operation and opened the Dinkle Tavern on South Main Street (SR 42) in a brick house that still stands. Dinkle is also spelled Dinkel; the current town&#x27;s main east-west street (SR 257) still carries the name Dinkel Avenue within the town limits. 

The first bridge across the North River was built in 1820 along the town&#x27;s north-south axis (present-day SR 42 / Main Street); and, for a time, the young community was known as Bridgeport. 

The Town received its charter from the Virginia General Assembly on February 7, 1835, then incorporated as Bridgewater. Every February 7, the town holds an annual Charter Day celebration to commemorate the granting of the charter.

Bridgewater College is located within the town, and was first established in 1880. The college has grown along with the town, now enrolling more than 1,800 students.

Since the creation of the town in 1835, Bridgewater has endured six major floods, including a devastating flood in 1949 that claimed two lives. As a result, the US Army Corps of Engineers constructed a long earthen levee to protect large portions of the town against future flooding.

Since the mid-1990s, the town has held a &quot;Summer&#x27;s End Celebration&quot; on Labor Day each year. The event has grown to include a 5k race, carnival rides, and live music, and is attended by thousands of people.

Floods have wrecked the town occasionally. The northern areas are partly shielded from flooding with an Army Corps of Engineers dam. The wooded monadnock called Round Hill (elevation approx. 1750 feet) dominates the town&#x27;s western skyline.

==Transportation==

The Sipe Center, which replaced the old building, is a new purpose-built multi-use theater with some exterior decorative elements inspired by the original Sipe building.

<text>Dayton is a town in Rockingham County, Virginia, United States. The population is 1,530 as of the 2010 census. It is included in the Harrisonburg, Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The town of Dayton is one of the oldest settled communities in Rockingham County, and is the county&#x27;s second oldest incorporated town, after Bridgewater. The first settler in Dayton was Daniel Harrison (c. 1702–1770), whose family settled along Cooks Creek, north of downtown. Daniel was the eldest son of Isaiah Harrison and second wife Abigail and was born in Oyster Bay, Long Island, New York. Daniel&#x27;s brother Thomas Harrison founded Harrisonburg several miles to the northeast. They and their three brothers had migrated from New York to Delaware and then to Orange County Virginia before settling in the Shenandoah Valley.

The family homestead, a two-story stone house, has been owned and maintained since 1977 by a private, non-profit organization, Fort Harrison, Inc. The town was known as Rifeville or Rifetown until 1833.

Shenandoah University has its roots in Dayton, when it was known as the Shenandoah College and Conservatory of Music. The college was organized in 1875 under the leadership of Rev. A.P. Funkhouser. This was a major institution in Dayton until 1960, when it moved to Winchester. College Street was named after the school and many of the street&#x27;s buildings served as part of the campus.

The Dayton Historic District, Daniel Harrison House, and Peter Paul House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 2018, a series of strikes and protests were held at the town&#x27;s Cargill plant.

<doc id="137748" wikidata="Q1375226" url="?curid=137748" title="Elkton, Virginia">
<text>Elkton (formerly Conrad&#x27;s Store) is an incorporated town in Rockingham County, Virginia, United States. It is included in the Harrisonburg Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 2,941 at the 2020 census and 2,762 at the 2010 census. Elkton was named for the Elk Run stream.

It is located along the south fork of the Shenandoah River at the intersections of east-west U.S. Route 33 and north-south U.S. Route 340. The town celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2008.

==History==
One of the first European-Americans to settle permanently in the area was Adam Miller (Mueller), a native of Germany. In 1741, Miller purchased , including a large lithia spring, near Elkton and lived on this property for the remainder of his life. He sold of this property to his son-in-law, Jacob Baer, and the spring on Miller’s land is still known as Bear Lithia Spring.

Conrads Store was a general store built by George Conrad about 1812.
George Conrad was a son of Captain Stephen Conrad who served during the American Revolution. In 1816, Conrads Store became a United States post office with George Conrad as its first postmaster. During the American Civil War (1861–1865), Conrads Store operated as a Confederate post office. In September 1866, postal service was briefly
discontinued at Conrads Store, and intermittently resumed
and discontinued over the next decade until 1881 when the name,
Elkton, was adopted as the name of new passenger station of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad. In January 1881, Elkton, Virginia was established as a post office. The Town of Elkton was officially incorporated on March 14, 1908.

An important building in the town&#x27;s history is the Jennings House. Built in 1840 by Dr. Samuel B. Jennings, the house was transformed into a hospital during the Civil War. The historic Jennings House was converted to house the local government. In the Summer of 2016, local government offices &amp; the Elkton Police Department were moved out of the Jennings building in favor of the Elkton Area Community Center. On December 11, 2020, the Jennings House was opened as the Elkton Town Hall after a nearly 8 month restoration process to restore the home and add modern amenities like updated electric, plumbing, HVAC, ADA compliant restrooms, and a wheelchair lift. The town Christmas tree can be found across the street from the house.

Located on Rockingham Street, the Miller-Kite House was the headquarters of General Stonewall Jackson at the start of the Shenandoah Valley Campaign during the Civil War. Now the house is a town landmark and museum, housing many items from the war and some of Jackson&#x27;s personal belongings. In one of the second-story windows a cardboard cutout of the General watches the street. Many visitors report stories of ghosts or unusual behavior while in the house.

In addition to the Miller-Kite House, Bon Air and the Kite Mansion are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Education==

Although incorporated towns may operate their own schools under Virginia law, Elkton area schools are operated by Rockingham County Public Schools, a Virginia public school division.

Elkton houses three public schools: Elkton Elementary School, Elkton Middle School, and East Rockingham High School. Elkton Elementary School was built in 1938 on West B Street to house Elkton High School, but its role changed when a new school was built. Elkton Middle School was originally Elkton High School, built in 1957 primarily for grades eight through twelve. Additions were built to the high school in 1967, building a ten-room annex for more classes; and the elementary school in 1972, replacing part of the original building. In 1980, a new high school, Spotswood Senior High School (now Spotswood High School), was built for eastern Rockingham County, Virginia, combining Montevideo and Elkton High Schools. The new school, located in Penn Laird, Virginia and literally on the Massanutten Mountain, housed grades 10-12. Ninth grade was added for the 1984-85 school year. Over the years, Elkton Elementary added programs such as Head Start for preschoolers. In the 1990s a baseball field, used for Elkton softball teams, was built next to the middle school. In the late 1990s, renovations were done to Elkton Elementary School, as well as the addition of a new playground was built specifically for the lower grades. In 2001, more construction took place as the old playground, with original wooden trucks and sharp metal edges, was replaced by softer and brighter rounded metallic structures. In 2005, more renovations were done to Elkton Middle School, such as changing the old band room into an addition to the cafeteria, building a new computer lab, and adding another gym separate from the main for public use, such as the Elkton Recreation League Basketball teams. In 2006 the fifth grade was moved from Elkton Elementary School to the middle school because of the extra space made by the renovations made in 2005. In 2010 the fifth grade was moved back to the elementary school.

In 2010, the County Board of Education opened a new high school for the eastern Rockingham area, East Rockingham High School, located in Solsburg beside River Bend Elementary School. Its attendance district encompasses the Elkton, McGaheysville, River Bend, and South River elementary school districts.

==Events==

Since 1908, the town has held a carnival called Elkton Field Day. It is held in early July and features rides, good food, yard sales, live bluegrass music, fireworks, and a greased pole climbing contest in which contestants try to retrieve prize money at the top of the 25 foot pole covered in hand soap. The event is sponsored by the Junior Order of the United American Mechanics in Elkton. The group gives out scholarships and help for those in need.

==Sports==
The town has a team in the Rockingham County Baseball League called the Elkton Blue Sox.

== History ==
The Rockingham Springs Hotel was the first resort developed at Massanutten. In 1875, Gerald. T. Hopkins, a farmer, created a health spa from the natural springs. A three-story hotel was built in the vicinity of the family hunting cabin (Hunters Cabin), which still stands at the present-day Hopkins Park, near the intersection of Lanier Lane and Massanutten Drive. When the popularity of health resorts declined, the hotel was closed in 1915.

Sidney Lanier, a well-known poet, visited Rockingham Springs before taking a teaching position in literature at Johns Hopkins University. Lanier Lane roughly follows the route to the site of Rockingham Springs.

In the late 1960s the great grandson of G.T. Hopkins, John L. Hopkins, envisioned a ski resort at Massanutten.

== Development and growth ==
In 1973, the Massanutten Development Corporation was chartered by John L. Hopkins III (President), the great grandson of G.T. Hopkins, Leland Leachman, (Vice President) Donald Litten, Len LaSala (Del Webb employee appointed Massanutten general manager). One and one-half million dollars was paid to individual property owners to assemble 5,300 acre at a price of $100-$300/acre. One piece was purchased for $1000/acre. Hopkins invited the Del Webb Corporation to enter the partnership.

In 1974, an economic downturn caused the Webb Corp to become the major stockholder. In 1977, Dale Stancil, former owner of Bryce Resort, purchased the resort for $1.9 million and renamed the property Massanutten Village, Inc. In 1980, John Swaim of First Federal Corp. acquired the resort for $4.0 million. In 1984, the current owner, Great Eastern Resorts (C. Dice Hammer and Jim Lambert) acquired the resort for $3.0 million in a bankruptcy reorganization plan.

<text>Castlewood is a census-designated place (CDP) in western Russell County, Virginia, United States. The population was 2,045 at the 2010 census, a small increase from the 2,036 reported in 2000. Castlewood was an incorporated town from 1991 to 1997, when it reverted to unincorporated status.

==History==
The community was originally named Castle&#x27;s Woods, as the land in the immediate area had once belonged to Jacob Castle, a frontiersman in the likes of Daniel Boone. Castle purchased the land from the Shawnee Indians, for very little in trade, reportedly just a &quot;hound dog, a knife, and a shot of whiskey&quot;. As a &quot;Long Hunter&quot;, Castle spent long periods of time in the wilderness on hunting expeditions. There he befriended the Indians that inhabited the land in the Castlewood area. He married a Shawnee woman by the name of Gliding Swan, and they produced many children. It has been said that Castle himself showed Daniel Boone the Cumberland Gap and areas west, which led to Boone&#x27;s expedition and settlement of these lands. Many descendants of Castle reside in Russell County, Virginia, and the surrounding area. Castle&#x27;s father, Peter Cassell, was a German emigrant to Pennsylvania who was influential in the Dutch movement to America.

The name was modified to Castlewood by the United States Postal Service in the late 1800s, as a simplification of the original spelling and pronunciation, which was common during this time period.

The Castlerun Historic District and Mason-Dorton School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==

<text>Gate City is a town in Scott County, Virginia, United States. The population was 2,034 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Scott County.

Gate City is part of the Kingsport–Bristol–Bristol metropolitan area, which is a component of the &quot;Tri-Cities&quot; region.

Some scenes from &quot;The River&quot; were shot here.

==History==
In 1771, Silas Engart received a land grant of 200 acres that included the location of the future town. By the time of Scott County&#x27;s formation in 1815, landowner James Davidson, Sr. donated approximately 13 acres of his plantation for establishing the county seat. The location of the town was such that it would emerge as an important commercial center for people and goods traveling through Big Moccasin Gap and the North Fork of the Holston River.

When the county seat was established in 1815, it was named Winfield in honor of War of 1812 hero Gen. Winfield Scott. The main street of the new town honored war hero and future president Andrew Jackson. 

In 1817, the town was renamed Estillville in honor of Benjamin Estill, a local judge instrumental in the formation of the new county. As a result of the county seat&#x27;s location near Big Moccasin Gap and the North Fork of the Holston River, the town grew into a commercial center for people passing through on their way westward, for farmers hoping to sell goods, and businessmen in town for legal affairs. A regular wagon train and coach line service conveying people, mail, and commercial goods between Bedford and Estilville.

Gate City received its present name in 1886, when Attorney General Rufus A. Ayers pointed out that proximity to Big Moccasin Gap marked the town as the &quot;Gate Way to the West.&quot; The town was incorporated in 1892.

By the beginning of the twentieth-century, Gate City was one of several &quot;boom towns&quot; located in southwestern Virginia. Although the streets were little more than dirt byways in the town, the area was a vibrant commercial and transportation center. Up to six daily passenger trains passed through Gate City. The town also had a railroad log yard where logs from all over the county were stored and then loaded to be later transported by train. Iron ore from the Snowflake and Nickelsville areas as well as glass sand from the south of Clinch Mountain were manufactured and shipped from Gate City. In addition, the town had a thriving manufacturing center in the area of Water Street where wood pumps, staves, sleds, and harnesses were built. By 1915, the town supported two livery stables on Willow Street and a blacksmith shop on Jackson Street, as well as a dentist&#x27;s office, an ice plant, a casket shop, and a furniture manufacturing business. By the 1930s, Gate City had three movie theaters, banks, and a hotel. The town also had two businesses that dealt with auto sales and repairs.

By the 1950s and 1960s, the town&#x27;s momentum was slowing. As industry in Kingsport, Tennessee (6 miles to the south) attracted Gate City residents, several local businesses and small manufacturing companies shut down. By 2010, many former commercial buildings stood vacant, but the Gate City Historic District was newly listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Pilot Flying J, the largest network of service station/travel centers in North America operating in 44 states and 6 Canadian provinces, and headquartered in Knoxville, TN, was started in Gate City in 1958.

Local businessman Frank Parker Sr. heard the future name on the &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; radio show during a skit involving the upscale real estate development of &quot;Weber City.&quot; As a joke, Parker erected a sign outside his service station on US 23 that read &quot;Welcome to Weber City.&quot; However, by the time the town was incorporated in 1954, the area had become known locally as &quot;Weber City.&quot; As such, the name was chosen for the new town.

==Geography==
Weber City is located at (36.623284, −82.561039).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

Weber City is located on the southern side of Moccasin Gap, a natural break in the mountains caused by Big Moccasin Creek, which was used by pioneers headed into Tennessee. To the south of Weber City, another gap leads into Tennessee. US 23 is the main road through Weber City and a primary north–south corridor for western Virginia.

<text>Basye is a census-designated place (CDP) in Shenandoah County, Virginia, United States. The population was 1,374 at the 2020 census. As of the 2000 census, the CDP was known as Basye-Bryce Mountain.

== History ==
Basye was named after a local family that lived in the area and whose cemetery remains off one of the holes on the golf course. Originally considered part of the Orkney Springs community, Basye was named by Martha Basye, married to William Brice, who opened the original resort. One of the early settlers seems to have been John Basye (born 1773 died 1856).

==Geography==
Basye is located at (38.818702, −78.763146).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 8.8 square miles (22.8 km2), of which 8.7 square miles (22.5 km2) is land and 0.2 square miles (0.3 km2) (1.05%) is water.

==Demographics==
At the 2020 census, there were 1,374 people and 491 households residing in the CDP. There were 1,498 housing units. The racial makeup of the CDP was 92.4% White, 0.8% African American, 0.6% Native American, 0.3% Asian, 0.9% from other races, and 5.0% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 5.1% of the population.

Of the 491 households, 58.5% were married couples living together, 22.2% had a female householder with no spouse present, and 12.4% had a male householder with no spouse present. 28.1% of the population were never-married individuals.

8.0% of the population were under the age of 5, 12.9% were under 18 years, 87.1% were 18 years and over, and 22.9% were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 47.1 years.

The median household income was $90,125 and the median family income was $106,250. Married-couple families had a median income of $110,417 versus $52,888 for nonfamily households. About 7.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 45.8% of those under age 18, 2.5% of those 18 to 64, and none of those 65 years and over.

==Bryce Resort==
Bryce Resort is the core of Basye, a resort with six ski slopes, a small lake with a man-made beach, an 18 hole par 71 golf course and a mountain bike trail. Bryce offers activities such as tubing and skiing in winter, swimming, tennis, grass skiing in the summer. The resort has opened a downhill mountain bike course. There is also a small aircraft landing strip on the site.

Bryce Resort occupies 400 acres and was first opened in 1909, owned by William Brice who opened Bryce’s Hillside Cottages and Mineral Baths as a way to catch the overflow of guests from nearby historic Orkney Springs Hotel. The name of the resort included a &quot;y&quot; instead of &quot;i&quot; in Bryce since William Brice reportedly wanted the business to have a different spelling than his last name. The early resort was rustic with hillside cottages and a dining hall, with most of the food grown on the premises. People would come to escape the city heat and take in the black sulphur spring in Basye.

William Brice&#x27;s son Pete and his wife Julie (who both adopted the Bryce spelling for their last name) began running the resort in 1947. In the 1960s they transformed the resort adding a ski slope and other amenities, selling 2,776 lots for a woodland mountain retreat aimed for the Washington, DC vacation home market.

=== Lake Laura ===
Lake Laura is a pond owned by Bryce Resort. Lake Laura is formed by a dam impoundment of the headwaters of Big Stony Creek, creating a rectangular-shaped pool with a maximum depth of thirty feet. It is open to public use and has a boat ramp for that purpose. The Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries began managing the fishery and stocking fish in the pond in 1991. The pond has one of the highest density largemouth bass populations found anywhere in Virginia. Lake Laura had a history of nuisance algal blooms and over-abundant aquatic vegetation caused by nutrient-rich sediment.

<doc id="137764" wikidata="Q1376596" url="?curid=137764" title="Mount Jackson, Virginia">
<text>Mount Jackson is a town in Shenandoah County, Virginia, United States. The population was 1,994 at the 2010 census.

For highway travelers passing by, Mount Jackson is easily identified from I-81 exit 273 by the water tower painted as a basket of apples, which was recently repainted. For those exploring off the highway, the town has history as a commercial and railroad hub in the region, with rich Civil War heritage and a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
in 1739, attracted by rich valley land and abundant water supply, Benjamin Allen purchased a 400-acre tract at the confluence of Mill Creek and the North Fork of the Shenandoah River and established a grist mill by 1746. Soon other settlers and small mills followed. The village was known as Mount Pleasant. On January 28, 1826, an act of the General Assembly of Virginia changed the name of the village in honor of General Andrew Jackson, the hero of the War of 1812.

Mount Jackson became relatively wealthy because of its location, about halfway between Winchester and Staunton along the Valley Turnpike through the Shenandoah Valley, at a place where a tributary, Mill Creek, fed into the North Fork of the Shenandoah River. This provided power for milling enterprises to serve the local farms. Another major road, Howard&#x27;s Lick Turnpike, was started in 1856, originating in town heading towards mountainous western Virginia. Generating further development, Mt. Jackson was the original terminus of the spur of the Manassas Gap Railroad that extended from Strasburg, Virginia. This railroad was a key conduit for the crops and produce of the region to go to market further east. The connection to Mt. Jackson was completed in 1859, but the Civil War stopped further construction so the line remained a spur with Mt. Jackson the endpoint. It was not until 1868, after the Baltimore &amp; Ohio bought the line and repaired it from war damage, that the rail line was completed through to Harrisonburg. Mt. Jackson became a small but significant rail entrepot for grain, apples, and livestock, continuing to prosper as a mill and railroad town during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

=== Civil War era ===
Company G of the 33rd Regiment of Virginia Infantry, part of the famous &quot;Stonewall Brigade&quot; under command of General Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson, was largely recruited in Mt. Jackson and vicinity.

The town saw conflict during the Civil War, incurred damage and was occupied by soldiers of both armies at various times. During his Valley Campaign of 1862, General Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson made one of his headquarters just south of town at a manor on Rude&#x27;s Hill, about 3 miles south of Mt. Jackson. As a highly defensible high ground position, commanding the Valley Pike, the North Fork of the Shenandoah River and Meem&#x27;s Bottom and approaches south, Rude&#x27;s Hill had a particularly active role in the Civil War, occupied, encamped on and contested by both armies from 1862 to 1865.

On November 16–18, 1863 Col. William H. Boyd&#x27;s Union cavalry reconnoitered from West Virginia to the area of the Valley Pike. The Federal troopers skirmished at Woodstock, Edinburg and Mt. Jackson. North of Mt. Jackson the Federals encountered Confederate cavalry under command of Maj. Robert White. White. The rebel troopers retreated through Mt. Jackson fighting, crossing the bridges through Meems Bottom and to the defensible position on Rude&#x27;s Hill. Realizing that White&#x27;s horse artillery could sweep the bridge from the hill, Boyd withdrew from the skirmish at Rude&#x27;s Hill and withdrew to Woodstock, pursued by Confederate cavalry. Boyd&#x27;s reconnaissance-in-force then returned to West Virginia. Losses from the Mount Jackson cavalry engagement were light on both sides.

Troop movements and engagements in and near the town were particularly active in May 1864, around the Battle of New Market, 7 miles from Mt. Jackson. On May 14 a delaying action was fought at Rude&#x27;s Hill by the Confederate 18th Virginia Cavalry, under the overall command of Col. John Imboden. The Confederate cavalry slowed the Union advance, enabling Gen. John Breckinridge to gather the main body of his Confederate forces at New Market, about 4 miles away. After losing the battle on May 15, Union General Franz Sigel managed to organize a rearguard on Rude&#x27;s Hill, with infantry east of the turnpike, some cavalry west of the road and the artillery behind the line. Due to the exhaustion of the men and low ammunition, Sigel decided to retreat across the Meems bottomland and the North Fork of the Shenandoah River to Mount Jackson. Breckinridge at the same time, concerned the Federals would make a stand on Rude&#x27;s Hill, advanced his cavalry and artillery to the crest of Rude&#x27;s Hill where they shelled and harassed Sigel&#x27;s retreating Federals in Meems Bottom. The Union army managed to cross Mill Creek at Mt. Jackson and burned the bridge that spanned the creek to Mt. Jackson before the Confederates could catch up.

Rude&#x27;s Hill was also the site of a Confederate stand following their demoralizing and humiliating defeat on September 22, 1864, at the Battle of Fisher&#x27;s Hill, about 23 miles north of Mt. Jackson. Gen. Jubal Early rallied and deployed his remaining Confederate infantry in line across the top of the hill on November 22, 1864, to check the advance of two divisions of Union cavalry following them. The Union cavalry charged the Confederate line but were repulsed in a sharp action. Early then retreated from Rude&#x27;s Hill to Harrisonburg, eventually retreating to the entrance of the Shenandoah Valley at Browns Gap in the Blue Ridge.

In a predawn raid on October 3, 1864, Confederate Captain John McNeill led approximately 50 Confederate rangers against roughly 100 Union troopers of the 8th Ohio Cavalry Regiment guarding a bridge from Meems Bottom, a strategic crossing of the Valley Turnpike over the North Fork of the Shenandoah River to Mt. Jackson. The attack lasted just fifteen minutes with most of the Union cavalry captured but McNeill, one of the best-known and feared Confederate partisan raiders as leader of McNeill&#x27;s Rangers, was mortally wounded. He was taken to the house on Rude&#x27;s Hill, where his identity was later discovered by Union General Philip Sheridan&#x27;s troops. He was later secreted away by a band of Confederates after the Federals had temporarily left, thinking him to sick to move. McNeill was taken by the Confederates to Harrisonburg where he died on November 10.

In October 1864, as part of Union General Phil Sheridan&#x27;s 1864 Valley Campaign aimed at destroying anything of potential military value, Mt. Jackson&#x27;s mill was obliterated. Towards the end of the war, Rude&#x27;s Hill was also the scene of a cavalry skirmish when Confederate Brigadier General Thomas Rosser&#x27;s troopers attacked Union troops guarding Confederate prisoners on March 7, 1865.

Outside of troop movements or significant engagements, Civil War skirmishes were recorded as happening at Mt. Jackson on March 25, 1862; June 3, 6 and 16, 1862; November 18, 1863; September 23–24, 1864; October 3, 1864; and March 7, 1865.

As the southern terminus of a north–south railroad line connecting to Northern Virginia, Mt. Jackson was an ideal location for military hospitals and became a center for military medical treatment, ultimately used by both sides in the conflict. A Confederate hospital was built in Mt. Jackson along the Manassas Gap Railroad in 1861, to which wounded and sick were to be transported by rail from the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Dr. Andrew Russell Meem, a graduate of Princeton University and a native of Mt. Jackson, ran the hospital and the land was donated by Col. Levi Rinker, a large slaveowner and one of the wealthiest families in the valley. The hospital, intended as a wayside hospital for intermediate care not a permanent treatment facility for badly wounded, consisted of three two story buildings and could accommodate 500 patients, a mixture of wounded soldiers and those sick from disease. The hospital functioned nearly continuously throughout the war, attending to wounded from the battles of Antietam, Gettysburg as well as the Shenandoah Valley campaigns. In addition, with shifting control of the town some Union soldiers were treated at the hospital and at other makeshift hospitals in the town, including Union Church. A Confederate cemetery was established across from the hospital, directly along the tracks of the railroad. At the end of the war in 1865, Union troops tore down the hospital, using the lumber to build a federal occupation installation on Rude&#x27;s Hill, 3 miles south of Mt. Jackson. This post was removed in 1875 when the Reconstruction era ended. The Confederate cemetery is all that visibly remains of the hospital today in the town of Mt. Jackson.

=== Historic buildings ===

One of the most notable landmarks in Mt. Jackson, Virginia is the little red brick Union Church in the center of town, built circa 1825, one of the oldest structures in the town. In 1822 an early settler bequeathed to the town a lot to build a nondenominational church for the use of any Christian congregations in the area. A frame church was originally erected on the site, but was replaced by the present brick structure around 1825. The church was used by both sides during the Civil War, including use as a hospital, with etchings on the walls by passing soldiers. Daniel Grey, a Revolutionary War soldier, lays buried here. Many of the most prominent early citizens of the area lay at rest in the church yard. Union Church is on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Mount Jackson Historic District encompasses 125 buildings and contributing structures in the town. This includes a variety of commercial, residential, and institutional buildings dating primarily from the late-19th to the early-20th century, the era of the town&#x27;s greatest prosperity. They are in a variety of popular architectural styles including Gothic Revival, Federal, and Queen Anne. Other notable buildings include the Stoneburner House, Tisinger House, S. P. Lonas House, Brill Building, Lonas Store, former Peoples Bank (c. 1904), Mt. Jackson Volunteer Fire Department (1936), Mt. Jackson Theatre Building (1938), St. Andrew&#x27;s Episcopal Church (1876), Mt. Jackson Methodist Episcopal Church (1884), and Triplett Middle School (1925). The historic district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.

The Bauserman Farm, Meems Bottom Covered Bridge and J.W.R. Moore House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Mount Jackson, in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley, is in the southern part of Shenandoah County, Virginia at (38.749950, -78.637638). The town is located just to the west of Short Mountain, a prominent ridge of the Massanutten Mountain Ridge. Short Mountain is seven miles in length, from Mount Jackson on the south end to Edinburg on the north.

The most prominent feature of Short Mountain is &quot;The Knob&quot;, a rocky top barren at the south end of the mountain, an iconic landmark overlooking Mt. Jackson, the image of which is part of the town&#x27;s official seal. When the Knob was threatened with private development, The Conservation Fund and Town of Mount Jackson worked together to secure $80,000 of funding to preserve it, purchasing it in January 2020 and conveying its 91 acres to the Forest Service to be part of the George Washington National Forest. 

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.2 square miles (3.2 km2), all of it land.

==Businesses==
Mt. Jackson hosts several businesses serving the region, including Holtzman Propane and Valley Fertilizer &amp; Chemical Company (established 1937). Bowman Andros Products has a fruit processing factory in Mt. Jackson. A recent successful enterprise located in the town is Route 11 Potato Chips, which moved its production facility to Mount Jackson in 2008.

==Transportation==

The primary highway passing by Mount Jackson is Interstate 81, which continues south to southwestern Virginia and Tennessee, and north to West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New York. Virginia State Route 292 connects I-81 to U.S. Route 11, the original and historic Valley Turnpike which now serves as the main local road passes through downtown Mount Jackson. Rt. 11, the historic route through the Shenandoah Valley, roughly parallels I-81 and offers access to it. Virginia State Route 263 named Orkney Springs Road extends westward from US 11 in Mount Jackson, connecting to Basye resort area and the historic Orkney Springs in the mountains of westernmost Shenandoah County.
Norfolk Southern has a rail line extending through Mt. Jackson, originally part of the historic Manassas Gap Railroad, that it has put out of service, lacking industrial demand. The last train traveled south from Mt. Jackson in 2014. In 2016 Norfolk Southern announced that it would no longer be maintaining the railbed, and the rail line has become overgrown with weeds and brush. Pending formal abandonment by the Norfolk Southern, a consortium of public, private and non-profit organizations based in the counties of Shenandoah and Rockingham, Virginia have come together in an exploratory group called the Shenandoah Rail Trail Partnership to seek transformation of the from Strasburg to Broadway (including Mt. Jackson as a historic hub) into a multi-use trail.

It is the largest town by population in the county and is known for its grassroots art culture, pottery, antiques, and American Civil War history. The population was 7,083 at the 2020 census.

==History==

===Early settlers===
German-speaking Pennsylvanians were among the first non-native settlers to arrive in the northern Shenandoah Valley and Strasburg area. The luscious greenery and fertile land were prime targets for immigrant farmers. On August 21, 1734, speculator Henry Willis was granted total of this land by William Gooch, Virginia&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor and Commander in Chief. Gooch wished to settle the Valley to create a buffer between Native American tribes and the rest of the Virginia colony. During the summer of 1735, Willis sold his entire property to Jacob Funk. Jacob, in return, partitioned his new purchase, reselling a part of it to his brother John.

In contrast to the English culture found east of the Blue Ridge Mountains, Strasburg was settled with family farms and towns rather than plantations (and slaves). Instead, the German language and Germanic architecture were more common than in areas east of the Blue Ridge. The thriving agricultural community that developed in the fertile bottomland along the banks of the Shenandoah River boasted scenic views of Massanutten Mountain (to the east) and the Allegheny Mountains (to the west). Later nicknamed “Pot Town,” Strasburg also became a center for the production of both utilitarian and fancy earthenware and stoneware pottery. During the 19th and 20th centuries, many residents worked for the railroad industry and at limestone quarries; after WWII, other industries came to Strasburg, including paper and automotive parts manufacturing. Today, Strasburg boasts a growing service economy, museums, eateries, numerous antique stores, and other shops.

===Founder===
Peter Stover (Petrus Stauffer) is considered the founder of the Town of Strasburg. Stover was born in 1715 to a German-Swiss father, Christian Stauffer I., in Mannheim, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Stauffer took his family to America in 1718 to gain religious freedom and settled in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, where he would live out his entire life.

His son Peter migrated south to Virginia by 1730 and to the Shenandoah Valley as early as 1739. On May 2, 1749, Stover purchased of land from Jacob Funk, his future father-in-law. The purchase was divided into smaller plots for sale to other settlers and a village was informally established.

Stover applied for a town charter in November 1761, giving the town the official name of Strasburg. The name was taken from Strasbourg, the capital of Alsace, France. Some called the area Staufferstadt, the German name for Stoverstown. Ten trustees were named; William Miller, Matthew Harrison, Jacob Bowman, Valentine Smith, Charles Buck, Peter Stover, Isaac Hite, Leonard Baltice, John Funk, and Philip Huffman (Hoffman).

Peter eventually married Frainey Funk before he died on August 13, 1799 at the age of 84. He was survived by eight children. Being a philanthropist for most of his life, Stover&#x27;s will left land and $10,000 to the community to establish schools. A monument resides in Strasburg&#x27;s Riverview Cemetery honoring Peter Stover, but the whereabouts of his grave is unknown.

Strasburg is directly served by two primary highways, U.S. Route 11 and Virginia State Route 55. US 11 extends north and south, serving primarily as a local service road for nearby Interstate 81. SR 55 extends east and west, also serving primarily as a local service road for nearby Interstate 66 from Strasburg on east. West of Strasburg, SR 55 is concurrent with U.S. Route 48, which extends into eastern West Virginia. Both US 11 and SR 55 have interchanges with I-81 on the northeastern and northwestern edges of the town, respectively. I-81 extends northwards to the eastern panhandle of West Virginia, western Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New York state, and southwards to Tennessee. It also interchanges with the start of I-66 just northeast of Strasburg, which extends eastward to Washington, D.C.

The western extension of Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s B-Line runs through Strasburg, though that section of the line usually only sees one short local train—ranging from once a week to once a day—which stops at the R.R. Donnelley plant in the town. South of its interchange with CSX at Strasburg Junction, the line is completely dormant. The CSX line also receives only sporadic local traffic.

<text>Woodstock is a town and the county seat of Shenandoah County, Virginia, United States. It has a population of 5,212 according to the 2017 census. Woodstock comprises 3.2 square miles of incorporated area of the town, and is located along the &quot;Seven Bends&quot; of the North Fork of the Shenandoah River. While some tourism references list Woodstock as the fourth oldest town in Virginia, the area was sparsely settled and perhaps platted in 1752 or shortly thereafter, but the town was actually established by charter in 1761. While there are a number of Virginia towns closer to the eastern seaboard that claim earlier founding dates, Woodstock was one of the first towns west of the Blue Ridge Mountains.

The Massanutten Military Academy is located in Woodstock, as is it the former location of the Sigma Sigma Sigma sorority&#x27;s national headquarter. Woodstock is also home to the River Bandits of the Valley Baseball League, the Shenandoah County Public School&#x27;s central campus, and the Shenandoah County Fairgrounds.

==History==
The Town of Woodstock was established by charter in March 1761 as a part of what was then Frederick County. It was originally formed from a land grant from Lord Fairfax, and founded as Muellerstadt (Miller Town) in 1752 by founder Jacob Muller (or &quot;Mueller&quot;). The town&#x27;s charter was sponsored by George Washington in Virginia&#x27;s House of Burgesses. Woodstock has been the County Seat of Shenandoah County since Shenandoah County&#x27;s formation in 1772.

=== Colonial era ===
The Shenandoah Valley region surrounding Woodstock was settled by Pennsylvania Germans who migrated south down the natural route of the Shenandoah Valley in the mid-18th century. The majority of these German settlers tended small farms that grew crops other than tobacco, were not slaveholders, and had Protestant faiths different from the established Anglican Church in Virginia, which differed from the English society that was prevalent on the eastern side of the Blue Ridge Mountains.

The Senedo people lived in the Shenandoah Valley around Woodstock, but they disappeared as a tribe prior to European settlement, possibly from attack by the Catawba people to the south. By the time the German settlers arrived, few Native Americans lived in the Shenandoah Valley. Several later tribes hunted in the valley, among them the Shawnee, Occoneechee, Monocans and Piscataways and the powerful Iroquois Confederation, so while not inhabiting the area Indians were likely not an uncommon sight. The seven bends have locations associated with Indian mounds dating back to the Late Woodland Period (AD 900–1650) in the area of the river between Woodstock and Strasburg, Virginia. After 250 years of plowing by settlers, the mounds have largely disappeared from sight, though traces of them have been detected with aerial photography

Relations between Indians and settlers were friendly. In the 1750s, settlers began to sense trouble when Indians moved further west, over the Allegheny Mountains, where they were under influence of the French. During the French and Indian War, the French encouraged Indian raiding parties against so-called &quot;English settlers&quot; though most settlers in the Woodstock area were likely peaceable Germans. In the 1760s, there was constant danger of Indian raids, with some atrocities and brutality. The last Indian raid in the area occurred in 1766, three years after the formal end of the French and Indian War, about two miles south of Woodstock.

Route 11, which runs through Woodstock, was originally an Indian trail that served as a route between the Catawba in the south and the Lengape in the north, which were warring rivals. This came to be known as the Indian Road and was the main route for settlement and travel through the Shenandoah Valley. With many improvements, Route 11 has largely followed this route, which was later called the Great Wagon Road and then the Valley Pike. Jacob Muller apparently used this old trail in laying out the plans for the main street of what would become Woodstock. Muellerstadt was the early name for Woodstock.

=== Establishment ===
The new village was established by an act in 1761, sponsored by George Washington, and the town was renamed Woodstock at that time. George Washington was a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, representing Frederick County, which the Woodstock area remained a part of until 1772. The act of the General Assembly gave full credit to Jacob Muller for initiating the idea. Muller came from Germany in 1749, and had initially settled in Pennsylvania. By 1752, he obtained 400 acres from Lord Fairfax for the area that eventually was included in the town limits of Woodstock. Muller settled in Narrow Passage near Woodstock, and in the next few years his holdings grew to something between 1200 and 2000 acres, and he proceeded to lay out a plan for the town, Mullerstadt. A few white settlers had preceded Muller, as the 1761 act establishing the town noted &quot;several persons are now living there.&quot; It is realistic to assume this meant a scattering of log buildings. However, Muller&#x27;s town plan was that referred to in the 1761 General Assembly act that established Woodstock.

There is no clear reason why the town&#x27;s name was changed to Woodstock, though theories include it being renamed by Washington or perhaps for a wood stockade used by the community as shelter from Indian raids. Jacob Muller&#x27;s town continued for many years to be known as Millerstown, or to German language residents as Muellerstadt. During the years following the establishment of the town, Muller held a big land sale in which 40 parcels he plotted were purchased. Muller died in 1766, just four years after his land sales. Andrew Brewbaker, his son-in-law, became proprietor of his grant, supported by a board of trustees appointed by the General Assembly to govern the new town. This form of government continued until 1795, when the town was authorized to hold elections. In 1761, the town&#x27;s appointed trustees left no records, so early history of Woodstock as a town cannot be determined with accuracy. There was also no local newspaper until 1817.

=== Revolutionary Era ===
In 1772, Woodstock became the county seat of Dunmore County, which was renamed Shenandoah County in 1777 during the American Revolutionary War, shedding the name of the controversial last royal governor of Virginia. Being named the county seat had significant impact for the development of the town. As a county seat, Woodstock necessitated the building of a courthouse and jail. By 1774, the county had erected a permanent courthouse. That original courthouse was replaced in 1795 with a limestone building designed by Thomas Jefferson, using native limestone. It was enlarged in 1871 and 1886. The Shenandoah County Courthouse, located on Main Street, is the oldest courthouse still in use west of the Blue Ridge Mountains.

====Peter Muhlenberg====

John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg, a native of Pennsylvania who was formerly a soldier in the British Army and German dragoons, accepted a call to become pastor to a Woodstock congregation in 1771. After theological training, he served both Lutherans and Episcopalians for four years in a wide-ranging pastorate in the Shenandoah Valley. During this time, he was drawn to in politics, serving in the House of Burgesses in 1774 and as a delegate to the First Virginia Convention. Muhlenberg became famous for his impassioned speeches in support of the American Revolutionary cause, helping to raise a regiment in the Shenandoah Valley among its German and Scots-Irish frontier population. He led the 8th Virginia Regiment, as its Colonel in the Continental Army. 

At the conclusion of his fiery farewell sermon in Woodstock on January 21, 1776, Muhlenberg famously threw off his clerical robes to reveal an officer&#x27;s uniform beneath and proclaimed, according to later reports, &quot;in the language of Holy Writ there is a time for all things, a time to preach and a time to pray, but those times have passed away. There is a time to fight, and that time has now come.&quot; Muhlenberg went on to be promoted to a general in the Continental Army and led units in many battles, from the Battle of Brandywine to the Battle of Yorktown. Upon the end of the war in 1783, he did not return to live in Woodstock, but instead returned to his native Pennsylvania as a war hero, served in elected capacities and then was elected to the First Continental Congress (1788-1789) and several successive Congresses. Elected to the United States Senate in 1801, he resigned to return to a revenue post in Philadelphia, where he died on October 1, 1807. His statue in the U.S. Capitol&#x27;s National Statuary Hall Collection was submitted by Pennsylvania in 1889, and Muhlenberg remains revered in Woodstock for his fiery sermon and the unit he raised and inspired to fight for the nation&#x27;s independence.

The frontier-recruited 8th Virginia Regiment was drawn from Augusta, Berkeley, Culpeper, Dunmore (Shenandoah), Fincastle, and Frederick Counties in the Shenandoah Valley. It was also drawn from the districts of Hampshire County and West Augusta, which are in present-day West Virginia, and elsewhere along the Virginia frontier, which stretched from Kentucky to Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh, PA). Two of the ten companies were raised from the Dunmore County area of Woodstock. It was led by Muhlenberg, Colonel of the regiment and Abraham Bowman, Lt. Colonel, both from Woodstock. The 8th Virginia was called &quot;The German Regiment&quot; though it also contained substantial numbers of Scots-Irish. Frequently separated and detached to other units, the men of this tough, frontier-bred regiment served with distinction in many theaters of the war: White Plains, Trenton, Princeton, Short Hills, Cooch&#x27;s Bridge, Brandywine, Saratoga, Germantown and Charleston. They suffered the hardships at Valley Forge, and were afterwards mustered out of service, with those who reenlisted merging into other Virginia units.

=== Railroads ===

The commercial importance of Woodstock was enhanced by the coming of the railroad, and the railroad had significant impact upon the Woodstock&#x27;s development. The first railroad south of Strasburg was the Manassas Gap Railroad. On March 2, 1859, the line was extended to Mount Jackson. The Civil War interrupted the work however, and the line remained a long spur from Strasburg, with Mount Jackson as the terminus. In 1865 the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) acquired and reconstructed the line after extensive damage during the Civil War, merging it with the Orange &amp; Alexandria to form the Orange, Alexandria and Manassas Railroad. They then extended the line to Harrisonburg in 1868. In 1872, the B&amp;O formed a separate subsidiary railroad on the line known as the Strasburg &amp; Harrisonburg RR (S&amp;H RR). In 1873 the B&amp;O RR leased and operated the S&amp;H RR between Strasburg and Harrisonburg. But the B&amp;O encountered financial difficulties and sold the S&amp;H railroad subsidiary to the Southern Railway in 1896.

In 1888, the B&amp;O built a passenger station in Woodstock, made with native limestone, noted as one of the more elaborate passenger depots in the region. Woodstock became a freight rail entrepot with outward bound shipments of grain, cattle and fruit and inward bound freight of manufactured goods, rail service that continued into the 1960s. Passenger service ended in 1948 and freight rail service began to decline in the 1950s, reflecting a nationwide shift to cars and trucks with the advent of the national highway system. While individual industries were still served, sometime before 1969 regular freight depot service ended and the Woodstock freight depot was demolished in the 1970s. The Southern Railway merged with the Norfolk &amp; Western in 1982 to become the Norfolk Southern Railroad, which owns the line through Woodstock to this day. However, industrial need for the line ended, and the rail between Strasburg between Edinburg (through Woodstock) is out of service, though the track remains.

In 1954, the B&amp;O sold the passenger station, and it was torn down in 1954 by a local businessman despite protests of many locals, and its loss damaged Woodstock&#x27;s historical character and heritage as a once-active railroad town.

=== Civil War Era ===
Confederate military units raised in Woodstock included Company F (the Muhlenberg Rifles) of the 10th Virginia Infantry (of whom 71% had German surnames) as well as Company C of the 33rd Virginia Infantry, part of the Stonewall Brigade led by Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson. While the area had an active Confederate population, it also was home to many reluctant secessionists, Unionists and families religiously opposed to slavery and war (Mennonites, German Dunkards.) In addition, traditional enmity between the slavery-based plantation society in eastern Virginia and the small farm populations over the rugged Blue Ridge and Allegheny mountains, where slavery was not as predominant an economic institution, meant that allegiances in the Shenandoah Valley and western Virginia were often divided. Many of German descent in the Shenandoah Valley were generally or religiously opposed to slavery, even as others with German ethnicity served in the Confederate Army.

The Civil War left no serious visible scars on the town, although there was partisan activity and retaliation. A few buildings were destroyed, notably the railroad depot and some warehouses along with a locomotive and some rolling stock. No major battles were fought in the immediate vicinity of the town, although skirmishes and large troop movements were not uncommon. Recorded skirmishes in Woodstock were May 18 and 21, 1862; June 2, 1862; February 26, 1863; November 16, 1863; September 23, 1864; and March 14, 1865. Various homes were used from time to time as staff headquarters by both sides, and as the occasional military hospital. General Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson made Woodstock his headquarters during part of his Valley Campaign in spring 1862, using the small brick law office near the courthouse. Union General Phil Sheridan sent a famous telegraph message from Woodstock during his own Valley campaign in 1864, during which his army destroyed anything of military value to the Confederates, stating “I have destroyed over 2,000 barns filled with wheat, burned over 70 mills filled with grain and flour. I have made the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia so bare that a crow flying over it would have to carry its knapsack.”

One small but significant cavalry battle occurred 4.5 miles north of Woodstock, at Tom&#x27;s Brook on October 9, 1864. The Battle of Tom&#x27;s Brook followed a Union victory at the Battle of Fisher&#x27;s Hill. After Fisher&#x27;s Hill, Sheridan&#x27;s Union cavalry pursued Jubal Early&#x27;s Confederates south to Staunton, after which the Federals withdrew, devastating anything of military benefit in their path, a campaign known in the Shenandoah as &quot;The Burning.&quot; Rebel cavalry harassed the withdrawal, until Union troopers under Wesley Merritt and George Armstrong Custer turned and routed the divided Confederate divisions of Rosser and Lomax at Tom&#x27;s Brook, 5 miles south of Strasburg and 4.5 miles north of Woodstock. The Confederate cavalry&#x27;s disorderly retreat from battle became known as the &quot;Woodstock Races&quot;, because the routed Rebel troopers fled back in disarray through Woodstock all the way to Mt. Jackson. A total of 6,300 Federal troopers and 3,500 Confederates engaged in the battle, with Union casualties at 57 and Confederate losses at 350. With the victory, the Union cavalry attained superiority in the Valley. The Battle of Tom&#x27;s Brook preceded by ten days the dramatic, large-scale and climactic battle at Cedar Creek (just north of Strasburg) between Early and Sheridan, which ended in a decisive Union victory that smashed any real threat of Confederate power in the Shenandoah or invasion of Washington DC via the Valley. The Battle of Tom&#x27;s Brook, and the &quot;Woodstock Races,&quot; occurred in significant part along the Valley Pike, now Route 11.

About 20 miles south of the town, the Battle of New Market also had Woodstock context. In conjunction with spring 1864 offensives, Union Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant ordered Maj. Gen. Franz Sigel to move down the Valley Pike from West Virginia to Lynchburg, to destroy its railroads and canal while denying the rich Shenandoah Valley to the Confederacy. Receiving intelligence on these movements, Confederate Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge scraped together all available troops, including cadets from Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in Lexington. Sigel&#x27;s advance was slowed by Confederate cavalry and undermined by his own command jealousies and inept decisions, but on May 11 his cavalry captured a lightly defended Woodstock. The Confederates were forced out of Woodstock so fast that several telegrams between Breckinridge and his cavalry commander John D. Imboden fell into Union hands. These Woodstock dispatches revealed strength and location of Confederate forces as well as a rough time table for a cavalry rendezvous with the main Confederate force - potentially a game-changing intelligence coup. But rather than acting decisively, Sigel continued his cautious advance, allowing Confederates time to concentrate. Breckenridge decided to attack Sigel&#x27;s army, which had advanced from Woodstock. The Battle of New Market occurred on morning of May 15. Threatened by cavalry on his flank and rear, Sigel withdrew and retreated through Woodstock all the way to Strasburg. Sigel&#x27;s army outnumbered Breckinridge&#x27;s by 6,275 to 4,087. Union losses were 841 while Confederate casualties were 531. The Valley remained in Confederate control until Sheridan&#x27;s arrival.

=== Historic Structures ===
Lantz Hall, a structure at Massanutten Military Academy, and the Shenandoah County Courthouse are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Woodstock Historic District comprising the historic center of the town of Woodstock, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. It includes examples of early architecture in the town from its earliest years into the 1940s, having been little altered since then.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 3,952 people, 1,685 households, and 1,029 families residing in the town. The population density was 1,216.9 people per square mile (469.5/km2). There were 1,840 housing units at an average density of 566.6 per square mile (218.6/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 91.62% White, 2.73% African American, 0.08% Native American, 0.18% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 4.28% from other races, and 1.09% from two or more races.

==Geography==
Woodstock is located at (38.877075, −78.511521).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 3.2 square miles (8.4 km2), all of it land.

The town is located 11.4 miles (18.3 km) southwest of Strasburg, 18 miles (29 km) southwest of Middletown, and 31.5 miles southwest of Winchester.

Woodstock is located along the &quot;Seven Bends&quot; of the North Fork of the Shenandoah River, which are seven significant meanders that are unusually sharp and tightly packed. In 48 miles (77 kilometers) of flow, the river travels only 16 miles (26 kilometers) as the crow flies. These large looping turns in the river were in earlier times a significant feature for which the town was known.

== Climate ==
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally cold though not severe winters. July highs averaging . Winters are chilly, with January lows averaging . Snowfall averages per year, while rainfall per year averages .

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Woodstock, due to lying between the 27 °F (−3 °C) isotherm and the 32 °F (0 °C) isotherm, is in the transition zone between a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfa&quot; on climate maps, and a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps. The hardiness zone is 6b.

== Recreation ==
Seven Bends State Park is located just outside of town limits with 1,066 acre area in total. The master plan for Seven Bends State Park was adopted on November 26, 2008 by the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR). The park is in the geographically unique &quot;Seven Bends&quot; area of the North Fork of the Shenandoah River and provides access to the River&#x27;s North Fork. The park&#x27;s eastern border is shared with the George Washington- Jefferson National Forest, and the park&#x27;s western boundary is the North Fork of the Shenandoah River, which includes a four-mile-long shoreline. 

The Woodstock Tower, built in 1935 by the Civilian Conservation Corps, is located on a 2000 ft mountain that overlooks the town. The tower is a popular sightseeing attraction, providing panoramic views of the valleys on either side and of the seven bends of the North Fork of the Shenandoah River. In March 2019, a portion of the road leading to the tower crumbled due to erosion. The road received $350,000 worth of repairs by Virginia Department of Transportation. The road re-opened again in November 2019.

In the August to September time frame each year, Woodstock&#x27;s Shenandoah County Fairgrounds plays host to the Shenandoah County Fair, which includes concerts, horse harness races, crafts, and farm exhibitions. The Shenandoah County Fair has been held on these premises since 1917. In addition, the Fairgrounds host a horse harness racing season in September and October called Shenandoah Downs.

===Viticultural attractions===

The Shenandoah Valley&#x27;s relatively dry climate, warm days and cool nights are conducive to producing good wine. The climate allows grapes to attain higher acidity, which is generally positive for wine. Limestone soil, which is common to the Valley, has been long associated with great wine growing regions in Europe. The region is a designated American Viticultural Area (AVA), Virginia&#x27;s first AVA, identified in 1982. The Shenandoah Valley is a relatively dry &quot;rain shadow,&quot; as storms soak the mountains on either side of the Blue Ridge and Alleghenies. The growing season in the Valley is distinctly warmer and drier than in neighboring Virginia regions, which don&#x27;t have the natural rain barrier from the nearby mountains, and where, east of the Blue Ridge, vineyard soils are primarily clay and loam. The annual rainfall in the Valley is one half that of the Virginia average. These conditions are thus more favorable for Cabernet Franc, Chambourcin, Cabernet Sauvignon, Lemberger, Petit Manseng, Petit Verdot, Pinot Noir, and Riesling. The area around Woodstock has several wineries. Muse Vineyards is located in Woodstock within the &quot;Seven Bends&quot; area of the North Fork of the Shenandoah River. Other nearby wineries include Cave Ridge Vineyard, about 14 miles southwest of Woodstock in the rural hills of Shenandoah County, and Shenandoah Vineyards, about 4.5 miles from Woodstock in Edinburg, VA (Shenandoah Vineyards is reportedly the second oldest active winery in Virginia and was founded in 1976). In addition to wineries, Woodstock has a brewpub, the Woodstock Brewhouse, founded in 2015, housed in a restored industrial-age facility that was formerly a Woodstock denim factory.

== Economy ==

The largest employers in Woodstock, as of 2016, were Shenandoah County School Board, Shenandoah County, Valley Health Care System, Walmart, Food Lion, and Lowe&#x27;s.

== Transportation ==

Interstate 81 is the main highway providing access to Woodstock. I-81 extends south to Tennessee and north to West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New York. Virginia State Route 42 extends southwest from Woodstock into rural southwestern Shenandoah County. SR 42 also connects I-81 to U.S. Route 11, which serves as a local service road for I-81 and is known as Main Street within Woodstock. Route 11 follows the historical route through the Shenandoah Valley, and was once known as the Indian Road and later the Great Wagon Road and the Valley Pike. Route 11 is now the principal local through road connecting towns in the Valley and is dotted with historical markers and scenic points.

The Norfolk Southern railroad has a rail line that runs through town for which service has been discontinued, but Norfolk Southern has been unclear as to whether they will fully abandon the line. It is part of a roughly 17 mile stretch of discontinued railroad line from Edinburg, VA to Strasburg, VA. Norfolk Southern announced in 2016 it was planning on no longer servicing the line. The rail bed is now increasingly overgrown with weeds and has not been maintained and putting it back into service would be costly and especially unlikely since there is no prospect of industry that needs rail service in volume that would be profitable for Norfolk Southern. There is discussion and ideas surrounding making 2.5 miles of the discontinued line in Woodstock into a rail trail, but the program&#x27;s funding has not been determined, and neither have the intentions of Norfolk Southern regarding the rail line. As part of its fiscal 2018 budget, the Woodstock Town Council approved $40,000 in capital improvement funds to hire a designer to develop blueprints of the trail system, but no designer has been hired yet, as the program is still in the &quot;exploratory phase.&quot;

Shenandoah Valley Commuter Bus Service offers weekday commuter bus service from Northern Shenandoah Valley including Shenandoah County and Warren County to Northern Virginia and Washington, D.C. including Arlington County and Fairfax County. Origination points in Shenandoah County include Woodstock. Origination points in Warren County include Front Royal and Linden.

<doc id="137772" wikidata="Q1756073" url="?curid=137772" title="Kriek lambic">
<text>Kriek lambic is a style of Belgian beer, made by fermenting lambic with sour Morello cherries. Traditionally &quot;Schaarbeekse krieken&quot; (a rare Belgian Morello variety) from the area around Brussels are used. As the Schaarbeek type cherries have become more difficult to find, some brewers have replaced these (partly or completely) with other varieties of sour cherries, sometimes imported.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from the Dutch word for this type of cherry (kriek).

==Brewing==
Traditionally, kriek is made by breweries in and around Brussels using lambic beer to which sour cherries (with the pits) are added. A lambic is a sour and dry Belgian beer, fermented spontaneously with airborne yeast said to be native to Brussels; the presence of cherries (or raspberries) predates the almost universal use of hops as a flavoring in beer.
A traditional kriek made from a lambic base beer is sour and dry as well. The cherries are left in for a period of several months, causing a refermentation of the additional sugar. Typically no sugar will be left so there will be a fruit flavour without sweetness. There will be a further maturation process after the cherries are removed.

More recently, some lambic brewers have added sugar to the final product of their fruit beers, in order to make them less intense and more approachable to a wider audience. They also use cherry juice rather than whole cherries and are matured for much shorter periods.

Framboise is a related, less traditional Belgian beer, fermented with raspberries instead of sour cherries. Kriek is also related to gueuze, which is not a fruit beer but is also based on refermented lambic beer. Some breweries, like Liefmans, make &quot;kriek&quot; beers based on oud bruin beer instead of lambic.

==Commercial examples==
Traditional krieks include:

*Lindemans Kriek Cuvée René
*Boon Oude Kriek
*Cantillon Kriek Lambic
*3 Fonteinen Kriek
*Girardin Kriek 1882
*Hanssens Kriek Lambic
*Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille
*Timmermans Traditional Kriek Lambic

Sweetened krieks include:

*Belle-Vue Kriek Lambic
*De Troch Chapeau Kriek Lambic
*Lindemans Kriek Lambic
*Boon Kriek Lambic
*Mort Subite Kriek Lambic
*Timmermans Kriek Lambic
*Van Honsebrouck St. Louis Kriek Lambic
*La Sultane Halal Kriek

Kriek based on Oud Bruin include:

*De Ryck Kriek Fantastiek
*Liefmans Kriek
*Kasteel Kriek
*Verhaeghe Echt Kriekenbier

==History==

Marion College, a two-year Lutheran women&#x27;s college, operated from 1873 to 1967. Marion Hall, constructed in 1968 and named in honor of Francis Marion, is a residence hall at Roanoke College.

Marion is also home to Southwestern Virginia Mental Health Institute.

In December 1864, during the Civil War, it was the site of the Battle of Marion.

Marion is the birthplace of the soft drink Mountain Dew. Although Mountain Dew was first marketed under that name in Knoxville, TN, the original soft drink&#x27;s formula changed drastically from Knoxville&#x27;s formula to the syrup mixture that constitutes today&#x27;s drink, which is Marion&#x27;s version. In 1961, the rights to Mountain Dew were purchased by the Marion-based Tip Corporation. The Mountain Dew flavor was reworked by Marion resident William H. &quot;Bill&quot; Jones. Due to the success of the revised formulation, the Pepsi Corporation purchased the Tip Corporation in 1964. Marion also hosted the Mountain Dew Festival for more than 50 years.

The Emory and Henry College School of Health Sciences was established in 2014.

Back of the Dragon, a segment of SR16 popular among motorcycle and sports car enthusiasts for its sharp turns and scenic overlooks, begins in Marion, Virginia.

Marion&#x27;s Park Place Drive-In Theatre, originally constructed in 1954, was named the eighth best drive-in in the United States by &quot;USA Today&quot; in May 2024.

R. T. Greer and Company, Henderson Building, Hotel Lincoln, Hungry Mother State Park Historic District, Lincoln Theatre, Marion Historic District, Marion Male Academy, Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Depot, Preston House, and the Abijah Thomas House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Boykins is a town in Southampton County, Virginia, United States. The population was 516 at the 2020 census.

==History==
John Boykin acquired a tract to the south of what became the town on the road to Severn, North Carolina, which lay partly in Virginia and partly in North Carolina. In 1829 Boykin and his wife sold the land and moved to Alabama. In 1835, Edward Beaton, one of three brothers who were living in Isle of Wight County near the Blackwater River, came to Southampton County and acquired the tract of land that is now known as Boykins from Francis Rochelle. Beaton, who was a continuous resident of Boykins until his death in 1880, is given credit for the founding of the town.

The Beaton-Powell House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Completed in 1857, this two-story plantation house has a living area that exceeds four thousand square feet and has an additional five hundred square feet of porch space. This residence has classic Greek Revival characteristics: the front portico with its pediment-like roof line supported by four columns; its bilateral symmetry; the corner pilasters that shoulder a wide entablature; the two- and four-panel doors; the two-over-two double hung sash windows and the five-inch exposure clapboard. The large roof overhang supported by massive brackets illustrates the Italianate influence. The milled timber framing is supported by a continuous brick foundation. All eight fireplace surrounds, exposed heart pine floors and most of its plaster walls, ceilings, crown molding and medallions are a few of the interior features that remain undisturbed. The original kitchen, which predates the house, still exists but has been relocated nearby, off the property. A noncontributing building on the property was constructed to complement the house.

The Beaton-Powell House has an abundance of Italianate embellishments but is primarily of the Greek Revival Style, alternately, in its antebellum heyday, called the National or Democratic and even the American Greek Revival Style.1 This two-story plantation house was built in 1857 on a 600-acre tract of land, known as Boykins Depot by the town&#x27;s founder, Edward Beaton.2 The house is now located on a half-acre landscaped lot at the northwest corner of Main Street and Virginia Avenue in the Town of Boykins, Southampton County, Virginia.3 Three conspicuous diagonal braces link together four paired, seven-inch square chamfered columns that support the massive, elaborate two tiered central portico which is capped with a gable roof.

<text>Courtland is an incorporated town in Southampton County, Virginia, United States. It is the county seat of Southampton County.

==History==
Native Americans of the Cheroenhaka (Nottoway), and Meherrin tribes were the first inhabitants of the land that is now Courtland. Virginia&#x27;s leaders prohibited Europeans from settling the area that is Courtland during the first 100 years of the colony. The Articles of Peace signed between the colony and the natives in 1677 set aside for use by Nottoway. As a result, the Nottoway established several settlements along the banks of the Nottoway River near what is now Courtland in the late 17th century. As late as 1821, the Nottoways maintained their traditional social order with a female leader.

In 1749, the European settlers formed Southampton County from Isle of Wight County, using the Blackwater River as the dividing line. In 1751, the county built a clerk&#x27;s office, pillory, and prison on the eastern bank of the Nottoway River in the geographic center of Southampton. A courthouse was added to the complex in 1752.

A town grew around the courthouse and became a courthouse village and minor market center. The courthouse burned in 1767 and was replaced in 1768. The town was incorporated as the Town Jerusalem by the Virginia General Assembly in 1791. Jerusalem was Southampton County&#x27;s only town through the 18th century. Eight trustees divided the town&#x27;s ten acres (40,000 m2) into half-acre lots alongside the courthouse on land owned by Joseph Scott and William Scott. The trustees created two streets—Main Street and the eastern end of Court Street. The trustees auctioned the lots with the requirement of adding a building within five years.

Henry Adams and Thomas Hunts purchased Lot 18 and built a house in 1796; they applied for a license to operate an ordinary there in 1797. Located across Main Street from the courthouse, the tavern offered a good view of the executions across the street, behind the jail&#x27;s fence. A new courthouse was built in 1798.

Samuel Kello Jr., one of the original eight trustees and the Southampton County clerk of court, purchased the tavern in 1799. In 1828, he sold the ordinary to Henry Vaughan. James Rochelle replaced Kello as clerk of court and moved into and expanded a house built in 1811 by his father-in-law on Lots 14 and 15, across Main Street from the courthouse. There in the 1839s, Rochelle taught law to his nephew, George H. Thomas, before Thomas entered the United States Military Academy and became a Union General during the Civil War. In 1830, the Jerusalem Jockey Club formed and coordinated racing seasons in May and November.

In August 1831, the town became well known nationally as the site of the trials and subsequent executions of Nat Turner and some of his cohorts who had planned a major slave rebellion in Southampton County During the rebellion, the county&#x27;s planters sought refuge in Jerusalem and the state militia used Vaughn&#x27;s tavern as its base of operation. However, a Richmond newspaper criticized Vaughn for charging the state $800 for militia expenses. Three years after the rebellion, the county&#x27;s leaders approved the construction of a new brick courthouse. Jeremiah Cobb and Clement Rochell constructed the courthouse for $2,500.34.

In 1835, &quot;Martin&#x27;s Gazetteer of Virginia&quot; said the town included &quot;25 houses, four stores, a saddlery, a carriage maker, two hotels, a masonic hall, and two houses of public entertainment (taverns).&quot; Despite its modest population of 175 people, the town became crowded when the court was in session. In 1839, Vaughn sold his tavern to Fielding J. Mahone, giving it the name Mahone&#x27;s Tavern. Mahone purchased the adjacent Hart Tavern and connected the two with a breezeway. Mahone&#x27;s teenage son moved to Jerusalem with the family. He is better known as Confederate Major General William Mahone who served in the Virginia House of Delegates, as Petersburg mayor, and as a U.S. Senator.

In 1853, the town was connected to Petersburg via the Jerusalem Plank Road, essentially today&#x27;s Virginia State Route 35. The Nottoway River also was a mode of transportation. The town was accessed from the south by a wooden bridge over the Nottoway that led to Rochelle Stree, just south of the courthouse.

The town was not the site of any military conflicts during the Civil War; however, troops passed through Jerusalem during the Siege of Suffolk and used Mahone&#x27;s Tavern and the Baptist church as temporary hospitals. Deceased soldiers were buried in a graveyard behind the church. After the Civil War, the town stagnated, probably due to the loss of enslaved labor in the surrounding area. However, nearly freed African Americans started participating in the political process after gaining the right to vote. A crowd of African Americans assembled in the town for a speech by progressive politician Thomas Jefferson Pretlow on June 21, 1867.

Josephine Howard acquired Mahone&#x27;s Tavern in 1869, renaming it Howard&#x27;s Hotel. It continued to be the center of town&#x27;s social gatherings, including a new tradition of a medieval-style tournament that featured colorful costumes, jousting on horseback, and a dinner and dance at the hotel.

Jerusalem became a stop on the Atlantic and Danville Railway in 1888, allowing residents to ride the train to Petersburg and Norfolk for business and shopping. The railroad led to rapid growth and change in the town. The town petitioned the state to change its name to Courland. Postmistress Fannie Barnett suggested the name change after town residents were teased in Norfolk as being &quot;those Arabs from Jerusalem&quot;. The General Assembly charted Courtland in 1888; this legislation expanded the town boundary and defined a new town government with an elected mayor and a council of six who could issue business licenses and levy local taxes.

With the railroad, Courtland became a center for processing and warehousing agricultural produce such as peanuts and cotton from the surrounding county. The north–south oriented railroad was built on land owned by the Kindred family who divided their tract into lots near the railroad. New warehouses were built adjacent to the tracks as early as 1888 and were available for lease to local farmers and businesses. The post office was relocated beside the railroad. The bridge across the Nottoway was moved away from the center of town in the late 19th century, aligning with the existing bridge on U.S. Route 58 Business that parallels the railroad tracks. The Birdsong Storage Company began a peanut milling plant in Courland at the turn of the 20th century. A fertilizer plant opened alongside the railroad.

In 1928 and 1929, the Courtland Rosenwald School was built on the north side of Courtland for $4,000. The Rosenwald Fund donated $500, the county contributed $2,500, and the town&#x27;s African American community raised $1,00. Courtland experienced two large fires in 1934 and 1935, damaging many historic structures and resulting in new buildings being added to the downtown commercial district. The Southampton County Training School opened outside of Courland in 1937, providing the first access to grades 8 through 12 for African Americans in the county. (Its name was changed to Riverview High School in 1963).

In 1947, the Hancock Peanut Company opened a processing facility outside town and employed 77 people; its founder invented the peanut shelling machine in 1944. However, the railroad service ended after the 1970s, and the railroad depot was demolished.

The David Temple AME Zion was built in 1966 on the west side of town and does not follow a revival style. The town&#x27;s main cemetery, Riverside Cemetery, was originally associated with St. Luke&#x27;s. The one-acre Helping Hand Cemetery is located on the north side of Courtland and was opened for African Americans in 1897. This historic district also included the Mahone-Manry cemetery, a private plot behind the Seven Gables house, and a Confederate burial ground behind the Courtland Baptist Church.The Southampton County Courthouse was built in June 1834 in a modest version of the Jeffersonian Classical style.

<text>Falmouth is a census-designated place (CDP) in Stafford County, Virginia, United States. Situated on the north bank of the Rappahannock River at the falls, the community is north of and opposite the city of Fredericksburg. Recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau as a census-designated place (CDP), Falmouth&#x27;s population was 4,956 as of the 2020 census.

== History ==

Founded in 1728 by the same act of the Virginia General Assembly that established neighboring Fredericksburg, Falmouth was created as a port town on the Rappahannock to serve inhabitants living north of the river within the vast Northern Neck holdings of Lord Fairfax. His agent, Robert &quot;King&quot; Carter, promoted the establishment of the town, and the Carter family played a dominant role in the town&#x27;s development throughout much of the colonial period.

Hunter&#x27;s Ironworks, also known as Rappahannock Forge, was an iron furnace located near Falmouth. Thomas Jefferson made special provision to protect the ironworks during the American Revolution.

The Falmouth Road was a colonial road that served as the main route connecting Winchester in the Shenandoah Valley to the port of Falmouth. This road follows a northwesterly route that was originally called the Shenandoah Hunting Path and crossed through the Piedmont counties of Stafford and Fauquier before passing over the Blue Ridge Mountains at Ashby&#x27;s Gap. Modern day US Highway 17 follows much of this route. Originally located within King George County, Falmouth became part of Stafford when county lines were redrawn in 1776.

It was a stop on the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad in the 19th century which was replaced by CSXT today. During the American Civil War, Falmouth was occupied by the Union Army in 1862 and 1863, and Northern commanders located their headquarters southeast of the town during the Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville campaigns. In May 1864, Union wounded and Confederate prisoners from the Battles of the Wilderness and Spotsylvania Court House were transported through the area to the wharves at Belle Plain on Potomac Creek, a tributary of the Potomac River, located east of Falmouth.

Today Falmouth is a residential community and a suburb of Fredericksburg. Among the community&#x27;s significant historic structures is Belmont, the home of American artist Gari Melchers, now a historic house museum administered by University of Mary Washington. Chatham Manor, the 1771 home of William Fitzhugh and a Union headquarters during the Civil War, is located downstream from Falmouth, opposite the historic district of Fredericksburg. It is administered by the National Park Service as part of Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania County Battlefields Memorial National Military Park and now serves as park headquarters.

Carlton, Clearview, the Conway House, Falmouth Historic District, Hunter&#x27;s Ironworks, Union Church and Cemetery, and White Oak Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="137785" wikidata="Q1373680" url="?curid=137785" title="Claremont, Virginia">
<text>Claremont is an incorporated town in Surry County, Virginia, United States. The population was 378 at the 2010 census. A granite marker is a memorial to British settlers&#x27; arrival in the area. It received its name during the colonial era from the royal residence in Surry Shire in England. The town was incorporated in 1886, had a port on the James River, and gained railroad service as a terminus for a while before being abandoned. Claremont was home to the Temperance, Industrial, and Collegiate Institute, a school for African Americans founded by a formerly enslaved person. The area includes a historical marker commemorating the institution.

== History ==
A granite marker in a circle in the center of town commemorates the landing here on May 5, 1607, of English settlers, before the landing at Jamestown across the navigable portion of the James River. English and Scotch emigrants had settled there, near the principal native American village called Quioughcohanock (probably located on what later became known as &quot;Wharf Bluff&quot;) by 1632. In 1649, Arthur Allen patented lands in Surry County and by 1655 built Allen&#x27;s Brick House in the lower part of the county. His descendants owned this property until 1882. His son Arthur Allen II in addition to his agricultural and mercantile activities became Speaker of the House of Burgesses. By the late 17th and early 18th centuries, Claremont was a busy port town and shipped many goods, but especially hogsheads of tobacco. Colonel William Allen served in the American Revolutionary War. Speaker Allen&#x27;s grandson John Allen lived at Claremont Manor House. He served in the Virginia House of Delegates and Virginia Ratifying Convention. His principal heir, Lt. Col. William Allen (1768–1831), also lived at Claremont and served many terms in the House of Delegates before the War of 1812 and supposedly became the largest land owner and enslaver in the Commonwealth of Virginia of his day. He never married and required his great-nephew and heir, William Griffin Orgain to change his surname to Allen to inherit. That William Allen became a lumber magnate, built a railroad, and in May 1861 became a Confederate officer and captain of the Jamestown Heavy Artillery (which he financed), Rails from his railroad were re-smelted to armor the Confederate ironclad Merrimac. However, Allen resigned his military commission in 1862.

After the Civil War, Claremont became a shipping port for railroad ties cut for the Prussian government and shipped to Hamburg. Willie Allen, who inherited Claremont Manor, moved to New York and sold the property. J. Frank Mancha, a Maryland or Delaware real estate developer, began developing and subdividing the property to build a new town there in 1879. Incorporated in 1886, the town of Claremont became the eastern terminus of the new Atlantic and Danville Railway (A&amp;D), a narrow gauge railroad, which was completed to a point near Emporia called James River Junction, where it connected with a standard gauge track towards Danville. Unfortunately for Claremont, the A&amp;D decided to link its western leg with a new eastern terminus in West Norfolk on the harbor of Hampton Roads, and the line to Claremont, which was never standard-gauged, went into semi-abandonment. After some use for lumber transport as the Surry, Sussex and Southampton Railway, the rails were removed in the late 1930s.

In the years since the area has remained a rural enclave, but some resort use has developed along the bluffs and beaches of the James River. Many homes along the riverfront were severely damaged, and Claremont&#x27;s neighboring beach, Sunken Meadow, was destroyed in 2003 by Hurricane Isabel.

In 2006, the old A&amp;D station at Claremont Beach (village, not the wharf) was still standing.

==Temperance, Industrial, and Collegiate Institute==
Dr. John Jefferson Smallwood established the Temperance, Industrial, and Collegiate Institute in Claremont on October 12, 1892, with fewer than ten students. Smallwood was born enslaved in Rich Square, North Carolina in 1863. The school&#x27;s campus covered more than 65 acres along the James River and served boys and girls from Virginia as well as other states.

The &quot;Richmond Planet&quot; covered the opening of Lincoln Memorial Hall on its campus in 1912, a significant accomplishment for the Institute. Smallwood became severely ill in September of that same year and was taken to the in Richmond, Virginia. He died on September 29, 1912, at the age of 49.

After Smallwood&#x27;s death, a period of mergers and name changes followed. When the school closed in 1928, it had more than 2,000 alums. A marker commemorating the school is at 37° 9.931′ N, 76° 58.404′ W. in Spring Grove, Virginia at the intersection of Colonial Trail West (Virginia Route 10) and Martin Luther King Highway (Virginia Route 40), on the right when traveling east on Colonial Trail West. A prominent memorial to Smallwood may be found at the Abundant Life Church Cemetery in Spring Grove, Virginia.

<text>Zecharia Sitchin (July 11, 1920 – October 9, 2010) was an author of a number of books proposing an explanation for human origins involving ancient astronauts. Sitchin attributed the creation of the ancient Sumerian culture to the &quot;Anunnaki&quot;, which he claimed was a race of extraterrestrials from a planet beyond Neptune called Nibiru. He claimed that Sumerian mythology suggests that this hypothetical planet of Nibiru is in an elongated, 3,600-year-long elliptical orbit around the Sun. Sitchin&#x27;s books have sold millions of copies worldwide and have been translated into more than 25 languages.

Sitchin&#x27;s ideas have been resoundingly rejected by scientists, academics, historians (including Sumerologists, Orientalists and Assyriologists) and anthropologists who dismiss his work as pseudoscience and pseudohistory. His work has been criticized for flawed methodology, ignoring archaeological and historical evidence, and mistranslations of ancient texts as well as for incorrect astronomical and scientific claims.

==Early life==

Sitchin was born to a Jewish family in Baku, the capital of then Soviet Azerbaijan, and raised in Mandatory Palestine (which in 1948 became the modern state of Israel). According to an interview in the New York Times he received a degree in economics from the University of London, and was an editor and journalist in Israel before moving to New York in 1952. While working as an executive for a shipping company, he taught himself Sumerian cuneiform and visited several archaeological sites.

==Ideas and works==
Similar to earlier authors such as Immanuel Velikovsky and Erich von Däniken, Sitchin advocated hypotheses in which extraterrestrial events supposedly played a significant role in ancient human history.

According to Sitchin&#x27;s interpretation of Mesopotamian iconography and symbolism, outlined in his 1976 book &quot;The 12th Planet&quot; and its sequels, there is an undiscovered planet beyond Neptune that follows a long, southern tilted elliptical orbit (he also indicated that part of its orbit is to the north of Earth&#x27;s equator), reaching the inner Solar System roughly every 3,600 years. This planet is called Nibiru (although Jupiter was the planet associated with the god Marduk in Babylonian cosmology). According to Sitchin, Nibiru (whose name was replaced with MARDUK in original legends by the Babylonian ruler of the same name in an attempt to co-opt the creation for himself) collided catastrophically with Tiamat (a goddess in the Babylonian creation myth the &quot;Enûma Eliš&quot;), which he considers to be another planet once located between Mars and Jupiter. This collision supposedly formed the planet Earth, the asteroid belt, and the comets. Sitchin states that when struck by one of planet Nibiru&#x27;s moons, Tiamat split in two, and then on a second pass Nibiru itself struck the broken fragments and one half of Tiamat became the asteroid belt. The second half, struck again by one of Nibiru&#x27;s moons, was pushed into a new orbit and became today&#x27;s planet Earth. Sitchin also speculated that Pluto (which he identifies as both Gaga and Isimud) was originally a satellite of Saturn but Nibiru&#x27;s gravity perturbed it, sending it to the outer Solar System and giving the body its peculiar orbital path, intersecting the orbit of Neptune.

According to Sitchin, Nibiru (called &quot;the twelfth planet&quot; because, Sitchin claimed, the Sumerians&#x27; gods-given conception of the Solar System counted all eight planets, plus Pluto, the Sun and the Moon) was the home of a technologically advanced human-like extraterrestrial race called the &quot;Anunnaki&quot; in Sumerian myth, who Sitchin states are called the &quot;Nephilim&quot; in Genesis. He wrote that they evolved after Nibiru entered the inner Solar System, and they first arrived on Earth probably 450,000 years ago, looking for minerals, especially gold, which they found and mined in Africa. Sitchin states that these &quot;gods&quot; were the rank-and-file workers of the colonial expedition to Earth from planet Nibiru.

According to Sitchin, Enki (the Sumerian god of water and human culture) suggested that to relieve the Anunnaki, who had mutinied over their dissatisfaction with their working conditions, that primitive workers (&quot;Homo sapiens&quot;) be created by genetic engineering as slaves to replace them in the gold mines by crossing extraterrestrial genes with those of &quot;Homo erectus&quot;. According to Sitchin, ancient inscriptions report that the human civilization in Sumer, Mesopotamia, was set up under the guidance of these &quot;gods&quot;, and human kingship was inaugurated to provide intermediaries between mankind and the Anunnaki (creating the &quot;divine right of kings&quot; doctrine). Sitchin believes that fallout from nuclear weapons, used during a war between factions of the extraterrestrials, is the &quot;evil wind&quot; described in the Lament for Ur that destroyed Ur around 2000 BCE. Sitchin states the exact year is 2024 BCE. Sitchin says that his research coincides with many biblical texts, and that biblical texts come originally from Sumerian writings.

==Influence==

Since the release of his first book &quot;The 12th Planet&quot; in 1976, Sitchin has written seven other books as part of his &quot;Earth Chronicles&quot; series, as well as six other companion books. Sitchin&#x27;s books have sold millions of copies worldwide and have been published in more than 25 languages. &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Corey Kilgannon has noted that despite academic dismissal of his work, Sitchin has &quot;a devoted following of readers&quot;.

Critic Michael S. Heiser has called Sitchin &quot;arguably the most important proponent of the ancient astronaut hypothesis over the last several decades&quot;. Sitchin was a frequent guest on the &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; radio show, which in 2010 presented Sitchin with a lifetime achievement award. &quot;Gods of the New Millennium&quot; author Alan F. Alford admits he initially became &quot;infatuated&quot; with Sitchin&#x27;s hypotheses but later became a critic of Sitchin&#x27;s interpretations of myth.

According to some writers, Sitchin&#x27;s ideas, along with those of Erich von Däniken, may have influenced the beliefs of the religious sect of Raëlism, and writer Mark Pilkington sees the mythology of Japan&#x27;s Pana Wave religious group as rooted in Sitchin&#x27;s &quot;The 12th Planet&quot; and its sequels.

The 1994 movie &quot;Stargate&quot;, directed by Roland Emmerich, and the 2009 video game &quot;The Conduit&quot; drew some conceptual inspiration from Sitchin&#x27;s ideas, while screenwriter Roberto Orci says the villains of the film &quot;Cowboys &amp; Aliens&quot; were inspired by Sitchin&#x27;s conceptualization of the Anunnaki as gold-mining aliens.

In 2000, Lorin Morgan-Richards&#x27; theatrical performance of &quot;ENKI&quot;, based on the writings of Zecharia Sitchin, premiered in Cleveland, Ohio under the choreography of Michael Medcalf.

In 2016, Kazem Finjan, the Iraqi Minister of Transport, claimed at a press conference that Sumerians had built and used an airport in the Dhi Qar Governorate to launch spaceships 5000 years ago. He cited the work of Sitchin and others to support his assertion.

==Criticisms==
Criticism of Sitchin&#x27;s work falls primarily into three categories: translations and interpretations of ancient texts, astronomical and scientific observations, and literalism of myth.

===Translations and interpretations===
When Sitchin wrote his books, only specialists could read the Sumerian language. However, sources such as the 2006 book &quot;Sumerian Lexicon&quot; have made the language more accessible to non-experts.

American biblical scholar Michael S. Heiser states he has found many inaccuracies in Sitchin&#x27;s translations and challenges interested parties to use this book to check their validity. Prof. Ronald H. Fritze, author of the book &quot;Invented Knowledge: False History, Fake Science and Pseudo-religions&quot;, mentions the example of Sitchin&#x27;s claim that the Sumerian sign &quot;DIĜIR&quot; means &quot;pure ones of the blazing rockets&quot;, adding that &quot;Sitchin&#x27;s assignment of meanings to ancient words is tendentious and frequently strained.&quot; Fritze also commented on Sitchin&#x27;s methodology, writing that &quot;When critics have checked Sitchin&#x27;s references, they have found that he frequently quotes out of context or truncates his quotes in a way that distorts evidence in order to prove his contentions. Evidence is presented selectively and contradictory evidence is ignored.&quot;

Sitchin bases his arguments on his personal interpretations of Egyptian and Sumerian texts, and the seal VA 243. Sitchin wrote that these ancient civilizations knew of a twelfth planet, when in fact they only knew five. Hundreds of Sumerian astronomical seals and calendars have been decoded and recorded, and the total count of planets on each seal has been five. Seal VA 243 has 12 dots that Sitchin identifies as planets. When translated, seal VA 243 reads &quot;You&#x27;re his Servant&quot; which is now thought to be a message from a nobleman to a servant. According to Heiser, the so-called sun on Seal VA 243 is not the Sumerian symbol for the sun but is a star, and the dots are also stars. The symbol on seal VA 243 has no resemblance to the hundreds of documented Sumerian sun symbols.

In a 1979 review of &quot;The Twelfth Planet&quot;, Roger W. Wescott, Professor of Anthropology and Linguistics at Drew University, Madison, New Jersey, noted Sitchin&#x27;s amateurishness with respect to the primacy of the Sumerian language:

===Astronomical and scientific observations===
Sitchin&#x27;s &quot;planetary collision&quot; hypothesis does superficially resemble one suggested by modern astronomers—the giant impact hypothesis of the Moon&#x27;s formation about 4.5 billion years ago by a body impacting with the newly formed Earth. However, Sitchin&#x27;s proposed series of rogue planetary collisions differ in both details and timing. As with Immanuel Velikovsky&#x27;s earlier &quot;Worlds in Collision&quot; thesis, Sitchin states that he has found evidence of ancient human knowledge of rogue celestial motions in a variety of mythological accounts. In Velikovsky&#x27;s case, these interplanetary collisions were supposed to have taken place within the span of human existence, whereas for Sitchin these occurred during the early stages of planetary formation, but entered the mythological account passed down via the alien race which purportedly evolved on Nibiru after these encounters.

According to former Immanuel Velikovsky assistant turned prolific critic, C. Leroy Ellenberger, &quot;[Sitchin states that] from an equal start, the Nephilim evolved on Nibiru 45 million years ahead of comparable development on Earth with its decidedly more favorable environment. Such an outcome is unlikely, to say the least, since Nibiru would spend over 99% of its time beyond Pluto. Sitchin&#x27;s explanation that heat from radioactive decay and a thick atmosphere keep Nibiru warm is absurd and does not address the problem of darkness in deep space. Also unexplained is how the Nephilim, who evolved long after Nibiru arrived, knew what happened when Nibiru first entered the solar system.&quot;

The scenario outlined by Sitchin, with Nibiru returning to the inner Solar System regularly every 3,600 years,

... implies an orbit with a semi-major axis of 235 astronomical units, extending from the asteroid belt to twelve times farther beyond the sun than Pluto. Elementary perturbation theory indicates that, under the most favorable circumstances of avoiding close encounters with other planets, no body with such an eccentric orbit would keep the same period for two consecutive passages. Within twelve orbits the object would be either ejected or converted to a short period object. Thus, the failed search for a trans-Plutonian planet by T.C. Van Flandern, of the U.S. Naval Observatory, which Sitchin uses to bolster his thesis, is no support at all.

Sitchin in &quot;the case of Adam&#x27;s alien genes&quot; states that 223 genes found by the Human Genome Sequencing Consortium are without the required predecessors on the genomic evolutionary tree. Later researchers have argued that the conclusion from the Human Genome Sequencing Consortium cannot be drawn due to a lack of a comprehensive gene database for comparison. An analysis by Salzberg identified 40 potential genes laterally transferred into the genome from prokaryotic organisms. Salzberg also argues that gene loss combined with sample size effects and evolutionary rate variation provide an alternative, more biologically plausible explanation.

===Literalism of myth===

Peter James, co-author of the controversial book &quot;Centuries of Darkness&quot;, has criticized Sitchin both for ignoring the world outside Mesopotamia and more specifically for wholly misunderstanding Sumerian, Assyrian and Babylonian literature:

William Irwin Thompson comments on what he calls Sitchin&#x27;s &#x27;literalism&#x27;:

<text>Dendron is a town in Surry County, Virginia, United States. The population was 251 at the 2020 census. Sculptor Leslie Garland Bolling was born in Dendron, as was mayor of Hopewell, Virginia, Curtis W. Harris.

==Geography==
Dendron is located at (37.044516, -76.934737).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 3.6 square miles (9.2 km), all land.

==History==

Dendron was originally a mill town, built and run by the Surry Lumber Company in to house employees of its sawmill. The village was known as Mussel Fork Village until 1896 when it was renamed &quot;Dendron.&quot; The name was derived from , the Greek word for tree. The years after 1896 saw rapid growth and expansion of the sawmill and the town. More people moved to Dendron and additional Company housing was built. By 1906, Dendron had a population of 1513 people, 298 dwellings, two hotels, eighteen Company stores and five churches.
By 1928, Dendron&#x27;s population had reached nearly 3,000 people. In addition to those establishments listed above, there was also a post office, two schools, a jail, two banks, two doctors, a skating rink, a movie theater, and a number of non-company owned businesses; such as a drug store, barber shops, garages, cleaning establishments, a pool room, a restaurant, bakery and an ice cream parlor.

The company also operated a narrow gauge railroad known as Sussex, Surry and Southampton Railway that transported logs to its sawmill in Dendron, and lumber to its wharf on the James River. It also offered passenger service to Dendron and other small towns along its route. One of its steam locomotives built in 1891 was sold to Argent Lumber company in 1926. It was later bought by Midwest Central Railroad in 1960. Completely restored it is still in operation as Midwest Central Railroad&#x27;s flagship locomotive.

Production peaked in 1920, and the company did not replant after it cut trees. By 1925, most of the area&#x27;s old growth timber was exhausted. The Surry Lumber Company shut its Dendron sawmills on October 27, 1927. With its major employer gone, the town lost population rapidly, as did nearby Sedley, Vicksville, and Central Hill. The following year, the company began dismantling and selling its equipment and buildings, leaving Dendron without a railroad, water system or electricity.

In February 1931, a fire swept through what was left of Dendron, destroying twenty-one buildings along Main Street and erasing much of what was left of the once prosperous town. A decade later, the rival Gray Lumber Company of Waverly, which had long replanted its land with pine seedlings, bought 15,000 acres from the nearly defunct Surry Lumber company, and three other companies soon bought most of the remaining acreage in other counties. The company&#x27;s headquarters in Dendron was razed in 1970, and the former commissary, converted into a store, burned down in 1989.

<text>Waverly is an incorporated town in Sussex County, Virginia, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 1,955.

==History==

Popular legend has it that William Mahone (1826–1895), builder of the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad (now Norfolk Southern), and his cultured wife, Otelia Butler Mahone (1837–1911), traveled along the newly completed Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad naming stations. Otelia was reading &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, a book written by Sir Walter Scott. From his historical Scottish novels, Otelia chose the place names of Waverly, as well as Windsor and Wakefield. She tapped the Scottish Clan &quot;McIvor&quot; for the name of Ivor, a small town in neighboring Southampton County. When they could not agree, it is said that they invented a new name in honor of their dispute, which is how the tiny community of Disputanta a few miles west of Waverly was named. The N&amp;P railroad was completed in 1858.

William Mahone became a Major General in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War, and later, a Senator in the United States Congress. A large portion of U.S. Route 460 between Petersburg and Suffolk is named in his honor.

Waverly is the second largest of the towns Gen. Mahone founded. Waverly has supplied the most state senators and delegate members to the Virginia General Assembly of any Virginia town under 3,000 people. They are Junius Edgar West, Delegate (1910–1912) and Senator (1912–1918); Thomas H. Howerton, Delegate (1912–1914); William O. Rogers, Senator (1924–1934); Garland &quot;Peck&quot; Gray, Senator (1942–1945 and 1948–1971); and Elmon T. Gray, Senator (1971–1992).

The Miles B. Carpenter House, Hunting Quarter, and Waverly Downtown Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

One of the last lynchings in Virginia happened in Waverly in 1925, when a black man was arrested for allegedly attacking a married white woman and stealing a pistol belonging to her husband. An armed mob of approximately 500 descended on the jail, seized the man, and then strung him up a tree, shot him, and burned him. The following day, Governor E. Lee Trinkle arrived in Waverly and admonished citizens. Negative publicity surrounding the event and the lynching of another black man in Wytheville, Virginia in 1926, led to anti-lynching legislation.

On February 24, 2016, an EF1 tornado moved directly through Waverly, killing three, as verified by the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries. The storm also caused significant damage to the town, destroying mobile homes, and damaging homes, businesses, trees, and power poles and lines. This was all part of a massive storm system that moved rapidly across the region.

<doc id="137795" wikidata="Q1376715" url="?curid=137795" title="Bluefield, Virginia">
<text>Bluefield is a town in Tazewell County, Virginia, United States, located along the Bluestone River. The population was 5,096 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Bluefield WV-VA micropolitan area which has a population of 106,363 in 2020.

==History==
Bluefield has not always borne the name Bluefield. The town developed around a small post office named &quot;Pin Hook&quot; in the 1860s, named for a small creek that ran through the community. For a brief time it was known as the community of Harman, named after a Civil War hero from the area who had been shot during the Battle of Cloyd&#x27;s Mountain in Pulaski County, Virginia.

Later, after coal was discovered and a company was formed to build a railroad to the Pocahontas Coalfields, the community&#x27;s name was changed again to &quot;Graham&quot; to honor Col. Thomas Graham, a Philadelphia capitalist. The town was first chartered by the Commonwealth of Virginia as the town of Graham in 1884. The Norfolk and Western railroad chose Bluefield, West Virginia over Graham as the place to build its regional headquarters and main docking yards for the Pocahontas region. As a result, Bluefield, West Virginia grew at a much faster rate than did Graham.

Graham, Virginia operated under that name until a referendum on June 10, 1924. By a margin of 287 to 223, voters in Graham approved changing the name of the 5,000 member town to Bluefield, Virginia to match the larger (22,000) West Virginia city. The name change was celebrated in a mock marriage ceremony held in the city park between officials of Bluefield, Virginia, and Bluefield, West Virginia, to celebrate the renaming of Graham. Its community had borders then that are roughly the same as the downtown area alongside the railroad of today&#x27;s Bluefield, Virginia.

Graham continued to hope for development as a major city in the region; it tried to attract a steel refining industry alongside the railyards. The Great Depression of the 1930s caused development in the region to come to a halt. The current Bluefield did not start to expand beyond the downtown area until the 1950s, when it annexed the small town of West Graham, Virginia to the west. It also began to develop land in the more open rural foothills to the south of the city.

As the largest town in Tazewell County, Virginia, Bluefield has expanded since the 1990s and the first decade of the new millennium. After a series of devastating floods in the early 21st century, the town has relocated its town council chambers and police department from the flood-prone historic downtown area to the southernmost point in the city at the foot of East River Mountain. The area has been developed with a Wal-Mart, the headquarters of First Community Bank, strip malls, and a medical center operating along U.S. Route 460.

Bluefield&#x27;s most prominent residents are Bill Dudley, an NFL Hall of Famer; New York Giants RB Ahmad Bradshaw; and the widow of actor Lorne Greene, who previously lived in a mansion atop a hill overlooking the Sanders house. This is considered one of the most significant historic homes in the city.

The Walter McDonald Sanders House and Alexander St. Clair House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Bluefield Blue Jays, a Minor League Baseball team, played their home games at Bowen Field, a stadium in the city park that serves both Bluefield and its neighbor of the same name in West Virginia. Although the park is operated by the West Virginia city, the stadium lies entirely within Virginia. In conjunction with a contraction of Minor League Baseball beginning with the 2021 season, the Appalachian League was reorganized as a collegiate summer baseball league, and the Blue Jays were replaced by a new franchise in the revamped league designed for rising college freshman and sophomores.

Bluefield University hosts many sports programs, including basketball, soccer, baseball, and now football.

Graham High School&#x27;s football team won the Virginia High School League&#x27;s Class 2 State Football Championship in 2024. The G-Men defeated Strasburg High School 31-8 on December, 14, 2024 at Salem City Stadium for the state crown. Previous state football titles were won in 1962, 1989, 1995, 2018, and 2022.

<doc id="137798" wikidata="Q732180" url="?curid=137798" title="Pocahontas, Virginia">
<text>Pocahontas is a town in Tazewell County, Virginia, United States. It was named for Chief Powhatan&#x27;s daughter, Pocahontas, who lived in the 17th-century Jamestown Settlement. The town was founded as a company mining town by the Southwest Virginia Improvement Company in 1881. It was the first company mining town in Virginia. The post office opened on June 30, 1882.

Its population was 268 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Bluefield, WV-VA micropolitan area, which has a population of 106,363.

==History==
Coal was known to exist in the western part of Virginia as early as 1750 when explorer Dr. Thomas Walker observed coal outcrops on Flat Top Mountain in western Virginia. His findings went largely unnoticed for nearly 125 years. In 1861, Confederate Major Jedediah &quot;Jed.&quot; Hotchkiss observed the same outcrops while he was a topographical engineer for General Robert E. Lee. In 1873, he hired Isiah Arnold Welch to survey timber and coal in the Flat Top Mountain area. Welch&#x27;s survey began at the residence of Jordan Nelson, a local blacksmith. In addition to using the coal from a large outcropping on his property, he sold it to people who came to purchase it by the bushel. Locals feared that actively mining the coal would deplete it. When the mine closed in 1955, after 73 years of continuous production, over 44 million tons had been shipped from the mine.

The depression of 1873 delayed further development until 1881. Hotchkiss, an advocate of Virginia industrialism, urged Frederick J. Kimball, a partner in the Philadelphia investment firm that established the Norfolk and Western Railroad (and later the railroad&#x27;s president) to extend the railroad from the New River Depot near Radford, Virginia to the coal fields of Southwest Virginia and Southern West Virginia. The firm financed both the railroad&#x27;s extension and the Southwest Virginia Improvement Company.

The railroad extension was established in 1881 by The Southwest Virginia Improvement Company under the direction of Mine Superintendent William Arthur Lathrop and architect Charles W. Bolton. At this time, the railroad line of Norfolk &amp; Western was still about 50 miles away from the town. 200 Hungarian, Swedish and German immigrant workers, recruited from Castle Garden, New York, arrived in January 1882. They and native workers from Virginia, North Carolina and West Virginia lived in tents set up among the cleared laurel thickets of Powell&#x27;s Bottom, which became the town&#x27;s location.

On June 30, 1882, Powell&#x27;s Bottom officially became Pocahontas when the post office was established with William A. Lathrop its first postmaster. The first house, finished in October 1882 at 181 W. Water St., is still standing and is a private residence as of October 2022. The railroad arrived in March 1883. The first carload (of coal) was used as fuel for the N&amp;W railroad and shipped on March 12, 1883. The Virginia Legislature granted a charter for the town on January 31, 1884.

The railroad line constructed to Pocahontas helped start the region&#x27;s coal boom in the late 19th century. The Norfolk and Western Railroad (reorganized as the Norfolk and Western Railway in 1896) (now Norfolk Southern) became nationally prominent during the 1880s primarily due to hauling the coal from the Pocahontas-Flat Top coal region. The Pocahontas large, two-state coal region was named after this town. The town reached its peak of population in 1920 and has declined markedly since 1960.

The Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development gave the town a $1,000,000 grant to help fund their downtown revitalization. In 2012, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of Historic Pocahontas to preserve buildings slated for demolition and redevelop them instead. The lawsuit stopped the revitalization project, which was never completed. In 2016, the lawsuit was dismissed, as one of the historic buildings was deemed unsafe after much of it had caved in.

This was used to heat homes across the United States and was the chosen fuel of the United States Navy. The exhibition mine features a coal seam, museum, education center, and restaurant. The museum created 16 new jobs and had over 3,500 visitors in 2021.

The Pocahontas Cemetery contains the side-by-side graves of 144 miners killed in a mine explosion in Pocahontas in 1884. A memorial for the victims is held each April.

St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, built by Hungarian immigrants who came to work in the coal mines, features ten life-sized murals on the ceiling and walls. The church holds an annual Hungarian cabbage roll dinner to honor the European heritage of workers in the coalfields.
