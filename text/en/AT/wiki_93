<text>Seabirds (also known as marine birds) are birds that are adapted to life within the marine environment. While seabirds vary greatly in lifestyle, behaviour and physiology, they often exhibit striking convergent evolution, as the same environmental problems and feeding niches have resulted in similar adaptations. The first seabirds evolved in the Cretaceous period, while modern seabird families emerged in the Paleogene.

Seabirds generally live longer, breed later and have fewer young than other birds, but they invest a great deal of time in their young. Most species nest in colonies, varying in size from a few dozen birds to millions. Many species are famous for undertaking long annual migrations, crossing the equator or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. They feed both at the ocean&#x27;s surface and below it, and even on each other. Seabirds can be highly pelagic, coastal, or in some cases spend a part of the year away from the sea entirely.

Seabirds and humans have a long history together: They have provided food to hunters, guided fishermen to fishing stocks, and led sailors to land. Many species are currently threatened by human activities such as oil spills, nets, climate change and severe weather. Conservation efforts include the establishment of wildlife refuges and adjustments to fishing techniques.

== Classification ==
There exists no single definition of which groups, families and species are seabirds, and most definitions are in some way arbitrary. Elizabeth Shreiber and Joanna Burger, two seabird scientists, said, &quot;The one common characteristic that all seabirds share is that they feed in saltwater; but, as seems to be true with any statement in biology, some do not.&quot; However, by convention, all of the Sphenisciformes (penguins), all of the Phaethontiformes (tropicbirds), all of the Procellariiformes (albatrosses and petrels), all of the Suliformes (gannets, boobies, frigatebirds, and cormorants) except the darters, one family of the Pelecaniformes (pelicans), and some of the Charadriiformes (gulls, skuas, terns, auks, and skimmers) are classified as seabirds. The phalaropes are usually included as well, since although they are waders (&quot;shorebirds&quot; in North America), two of the three species (red and red-necked) are oceanic for nine months of the year, crossing the equator to feed pelagically.

Loons and grebes, which nest on lakes but winter at sea, are usually categorized as water birds, not seabirds. Although there are a number of sea ducks in the family Anatidae that are truly marine in the winter, by convention they are usually excluded from the seabird grouping. Many herons and waders (or shorebirds), such as crab-plovers, are also highly marine, living on the sea&#x27;s edge (coast), but are also not treated as seabirds. Fish-eating birds of prey, such as sea eagles and ospreys, are also typically excluded, however tied to marine environments they may be. Some birds, such as darters and anhingas, are primarily found in freshwater habitats, but may occasionally venture into marine or coastal areas as well; such birds are generally not considered to be seabirds.

German ornithologist Gerald Mayr defined the &quot;core waterbird&quot; clade Aequornithes in 2010. This lineage gives rise to the Procellariiformes, Sphenisciformes, Suliformes, Pelecaniformes, Ciconiiformes (not seabirds), and Gaviiformes (not seabirds). The tropicbirds (Phaethontiformes) are part of the Eurypygimorphae lineage, which is sister to the Aequornithes; this clade also includes the non-seabird Eurypygiformes (kagu and sunbittern). The Charadriiformes are more distantly related to the other seabirds, being more closely related to the non-seabird Gruiformes (rails and cranes) and Opisthocomiformes (hoatzin) in the clade Gruae.

== Evolution and fossil record ==
Seabirds, by virtue of living in a geologically depositional environment (that is, in the sea where sediments are readily laid down), are well represented in the fossil record. They are first known to occur in the Cretaceous period, the earliest being the Hesperornithes. These were flightless seabirds that could dive in a fashion similar to grebes and loons (using its feet to move underwater), but had beaks filled with sharp teeth. Other Cretaceous seabirds included the gull-like Ichthyornithes. Flying Cretaceous seabirds do not exceed wingspans of two meters; piscivorous pterosaurs occupied seagoing niches above this size.

While &quot;Hesperornis&quot; is not thought to have left descendants, the earliest modern seabirds also occurred in the Cretaceous, with a species called &quot;Tytthostonyx glauconiticus&quot;, which has features suggestive of Procellariiformes and Fregatidae. As a clade, the Aequornithes either became seabirds in a single transition in the Cretaceous or some lineages such as pelicans and frigatebirds adapted to sea living independently from freshwater-dwelling ancestors. In the Paleogene both pterosaurs and marine reptiles became extinct, allowing seabirds to expand ecologically. These post-extinction seas were dominated by early Procellariidae, giant penguins and two extinct families, the Pelagornithidae and the Plotopteridae (a group of large seabirds that looked like the penguins). Modern genera began their wide radiation in the Miocene, although the genus &quot;Puffinus&quot; (which includes today&#x27;s Manx shearwater and sooty shearwater) might date back to the Oligocene. Within the Charadriiformes, the gulls and allies (Lari) became seabirds in the late Eocene, and then waders in the middle Miocene (Langhian). The highest diversity of seabirds apparently existed during the Late Miocene and the Pliocene. At the end of the latter, the oceanic food web had undergone a period of upheaval due to extinction of considerable numbers of marine species; subsequently, the spread of marine mammals seems to have prevented seabirds from reaching their erstwhile diversity.

== Characteristics ==

=== Adaptations to life at sea ===
Seabirds have made numerous adaptations to living on and feeding in the sea. Wing morphology has been shaped by the niche an individual species or family has evolved, so that looking at a wing&#x27;s shape and loading can tell a scientist about its life feeding behaviour. Longer wings and low wing loading are typical of more pelagic species, while diving species have shorter wings. Species such as the wandering albatross, which forage over huge areas of sea, have a reduced capacity for powered flight and are dependent on a type of gliding called dynamic soaring (where the wind deflected by waves provides lift) as well as slope soaring. Seabirds also almost always have webbed feet, to aid movement on the surface as well as assisting diving in some species. The Procellariiformes are unusual among birds in having a strong sense of smell, which is used to find widely distributed food in a vast ocean, and help distinguish familiar nest odours from unfamiliar ones.

Salt glands are used by seabirds to deal with the salt they ingest by drinking and feeding (particularly on crustaceans), and to help them osmoregulate. The excretions from these glands (which are positioned in the head of the birds, emerging from the nasal cavity) are almost pure sodium chloride.

With the exception of the cormorants and some terns, and in common with most other birds, all seabirds have waterproof plumage. However, compared to land birds, they have far more feathers protecting their bodies. This dense plumage is better able to protect the bird from getting wet, and cold is kept out by a dense layer of down feathers. The cormorants possess a layer of unique feathers that retain a smaller layer of air (compared to other diving birds) but otherwise soak up water. This allows them to swim without fighting the buoyancy that retaining air in the feathers causes, yet retain enough air to prevent the bird losing excessive heat through contact with water.

The plumage of most seabirds is less colourful than that of land birds, restricted in the main to variations of black, white or grey. A few species sport colourful plumes (such as the tropicbirds and some penguins), but most of the colour in seabirds appears in the bills and legs. The plumage of seabirds is thought in many cases to be for camouflage, both defensive (the colour of US Navy battleships is the same as that of Antarctic prions, and in both cases it reduces visibility at sea) and aggressive (the white underside possessed by many seabirds helps hide them from prey below). The usually black wing tips help prevent wear, as they contain melanins that help the feathers resist abrasion.

=== Diet and feeding ===
Seabirds evolved to exploit different food resources in the world&#x27;s seas and oceans, and to a great extent, their physiology and behaviour have been shaped by their diet. These evolutionary forces have often caused species in different families and even orders to evolve similar strategies and adaptations to the same problems, leading to remarkable convergent evolution, such as that between auks and penguins. There are four basic feeding strategies, or ecological guilds, for feeding at sea: surface feeding, pursuit diving, plunge diving, and predation of higher vertebrates; within these guilds, there are multiple variations on the theme.

==== Surface feeding ====
Many seabirds feed on the ocean&#x27;s surface, as the action of marine currents often concentrates food such as krill, forage fish, squid, or other prey items within reach of a dipped head.

Surface feeding itself can be broken up into two different approaches, surface feeding while flying (for example as practiced by gadfly petrels, frigatebirds, and storm petrels), and surface feeding while swimming (examples of which are practiced by gulls, fulmars, many of the shearwaters and gadfly petrels). Surface feeders in flight include some of the most acrobatic of seabirds, which either snatch morsels from the water (as do frigatebirds and some terns), or &quot;walk&quot;, pattering and hovering on the water&#x27;s surface, as some of the storm petrels do. Many of these do not ever land in the water, and some, such as the frigatebirds, have difficulty getting airborne again should they do so. Another seabird family that does not land while feeding is the skimmer, which has a unique fishing method: flying along the surface with the lower mandible in the water—this shuts automatically when the bill touches something in the water. The skimmer&#x27;s bill reflects its unusual lifestyle, with the lower mandible uniquely being longer than the upper one.

Surface feeders that swim often have unique bills as well, adapted for their specific prey. Prions have special bills with filters called lamellae to filter out plankton from mouthfuls of water, and many albatrosses and petrels have hooked bills to snatch fast-moving prey. On the other hand, most gulls are versatile and opportunistic feeders who will eat a wide variety of prey, both at sea and on land.

==== Pursuit diving ====

Pursuit diving exerts greater pressures (both evolutionary and physiological) on seabirds, but the reward is a greater area in which to feed than is available to surface feeders. Underwater propulsion is provided by wings (as used by penguins, auks, diving petrels and some other species of petrel) or feet (as used by cormorants, grebes, loons and several types of fish-eating ducks). Wing-propelled divers are generally faster than foot-propelled divers. The use of wings or feet for diving has limited their utility in other situations: loons and grebes walk with extreme difficulty (if at all), penguins cannot fly, and auks have sacrificed flight efficiency in favour of diving. For example, the razorbill (an Atlantic auk) requires 64% more energy to fly than a petrel of equivalent size. Many shearwaters are intermediate between the two, having longer wings than typical wing-propelled divers but heavier wing loadings than the other surface-feeding procellariids, leaving them capable of diving to considerable depths while still being efficient long-distance travellers. The short-tailed shearwater is the deepest diver of the shearwaters, having been recorded diving below .

Some albatross species are also capable of limited diving, with light-mantled sooty albatrosses holding the record at . Of all the wing-propelled pursuit divers, the most efficient in the air are the albatrosses, and they are also the poorest divers. This is the dominant guild in polar and subpolar environments, but it is energetically inefficient in warmer waters. With their poor flying ability, many wing-propelled pursuit divers are more limited in their foraging range than other guilds.

==== Plunge diving ====
Gannets, boobies, tropicbirds, some terns, and brown pelicans all engage in plunge diving, taking fast-moving prey by diving into the water from flight. Plunge diving allows birds to use the energy from the momentum of the dive to combat natural buoyancy (caused by air trapped in plumage), and thus uses less energy than the dedicated pursuit divers, allowing them to utilise more widely distributed food resources, for example, in impoverished tropical seas. In general, this is the most specialised method of hunting employed by seabirds; other non-specialists (such as gulls and skuas) may employ it but do so with less skill and from lower heights. In brown pelicans, the skills of plunge diving take several years to fully develop—once mature, they can dive from above the water&#x27;s surface, shifting the body before impact to avoid injury.

It may be that plunge divers are restricted in their hunting grounds to clear waters that afford a view of their prey from the air. While they are the dominant guild in the tropics, the link between plunge diving and water clarity is inconclusive. Some plunge divers (as well as some surface feeders) are dependent on dolphins and tuna to push shoaling fish up towards the surface.

==== Kleptoparasitism, scavenging and predation ====
This catch-all category refers to other seabird strategies that involve the next trophic level up. Kleptoparasites are seabirds that make a part of their living stealing food of other seabirds. Most famously, frigatebirds and skuas engage in this behaviour, although gulls, terns and other species will steal food opportunistically. The nocturnal nesting behaviour of some seabirds has been interpreted as arising due to pressure from this aerial piracy. Kleptoparasitism is not thought to play a significant part of the diet of any species, and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting. A study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds could at most obtain 40% of the food they needed, and on average obtained only 5%. Many species of gull will feed on seabird and sea mammal carrion when the opportunity arises, as will giant petrels. Some species of albatross also engage in scavenging: an analysis of regurgitated squid beaks has shown that many of the squid eaten are too large to have been caught alive, and include mid-water species likely to be beyond the reach of albatrosses. Some species will also feed on other seabirds; for example, gulls, skuas and pelicans will often take eggs, chicks and even small adult seabirds from nesting colonies, while the giant petrels can kill prey up to the size of small penguins and seal pups.

=== Life history ===
Seabirds&#x27; life histories are dramatically different from those of land birds. In general, they are K-selected, live much longer (anywhere between twenty and sixty years), delay breeding for longer (for up to ten years), and invest more effort into fewer young. Most species will only have one clutch a year, unless they lose the first (with a few exceptions, like the Cassin&#x27;s auklet), and many species (like the tubenoses and sulids) will only lay one egg a year.

Care of young is protracted, extending for as long as six months, among the longest for birds. For example, once common guillemot chicks fledge, they remain with the male parent for several months at sea. The frigatebirds have the longest period of parental care of any bird except a few raptors and the southern ground hornbill, with each chick fledging after four to six months and continued assistance after that for up to fourteen months. Due to the extended period of care, breeding occurs every two years rather than annually for some species. This life-history strategy has probably evolved both in response to the challenges of living at sea (collecting widely scattered prey items), the frequency of breeding failures due to unfavourable marine conditions, and the relative lack of predation compared to that of land-living birds.

Because of the greater investment in raising the young and because foraging for food may occur far from the nest site, in all seabird species except the phalaropes, both parents participate in caring for the young, and pairs are typically at least seasonally monogamous. Many species, such as gulls, auks and penguins, retain the same mate for several seasons, and many petrel species mate for life. Albatrosses and procellariids, which mate for life, take many years to form a pair bond before they breed, and the albatrosses have an elaborate breeding dance that is part of pair-bond formation.

=== Breeding and colonies ===

Ninety-five percent of seabirds are colonial, and seabird colonies are among the largest bird colonies in the world, providing one of Earth&#x27;s great wildlife spectacles. Colonies of over a million birds have been recorded, both in the tropics (such as Kiritimati in the Pacific) and in the polar latitudes (as in Antarctica). Seabird colonies occur exclusively for the purpose of breeding; non-breeding birds will only collect together outside the breeding season in areas where prey species are densely aggregated.

Seabird colonies are highly variable. Individual nesting sites can be widely spaced, as in an albatross colony, or densely packed as with a murre colony. In most seabird colonies, several different species will nest on the same colony, often exhibiting some niche separation. Seabirds can nest in trees (if any are available), on the ground (with or without nests), on cliffs, in burrows under the ground and in rocky crevices. Competition can be strong both within species and between species, with aggressive species such as sooty terns pushing less dominant species out of the most desirable nesting spaces. The tropical Bonin petrel nests during the winter to avoid competition with the more aggressive wedge-tailed shearwater. When the seasons overlap, the wedge-tailed shearwaters will kill young Bonin petrels in order to use their burrows.

Many seabirds show remarkable site fidelity, returning to the same burrow, nest or site for many years, and they will defend that site from rivals with great vigour. This increases breeding success, provides a place for returning mates to reunite, and reduces the costs of prospecting for a new site. Young adults breeding for the first time usually return to their natal colony, and often nest close to where they hatched. This tendency, known as philopatry, is so strong that a study of Laysan albatrosses found that the average distance between hatching site and the site where a bird established its own territory was ; another study, this time on Cory&#x27;s shearwaters nesting near Corsica, found that of nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony bred in the burrow they were raised in, and two actually bred with their own mother.

Colonies are usually situated on islands, cliffs or headlands, which land mammals have difficulty accessing. This is thought to provide protection to seabirds, which are often very clumsy on land. Coloniality often arises in types of birds that do not defend feeding territories (such as swifts, which have a very variable prey source); this may be a reason why it arises more frequently in seabirds. There are other possible advantages: colonies may act as information centres, where seabirds returning to the sea to forage can find out where prey is by studying returning individuals of the same species. There are disadvantages to colonial life, particularly the spread of disease. Colonies also attract the attention of predators, principally other birds, and many species attend their colonies nocturnally to avoid predation. Birds from different colonies often forage in different areas to avoid competition.

=== Migration ===

Like many birds, seabirds often migrate after the breeding season. Of these, the trip taken by the Arctic tern is the farthest of any bird, crossing the equator in order to spend the Austral summer in Antarctica. Other species also undertake trans-equatorial trips, both from the north to the south, and from south to north. The population of elegant terns, which nest off Baja California, splits after the breeding season with some birds travelling north to the Central Coast of California and some travelling as far south as Peru and Chile to feed in the Humboldt Current. The sooty shearwater undertakes an annual migration cycle that rivals that of the Arctic tern; birds that nest in New Zealand and Chile and spend the northern summer feeding in the North Pacific off Japan, Alaska and California, an annual round trip of .

Other species also migrate shorter distances away from the breeding sites, their distribution at sea determined by the availability of food. If oceanic conditions are unsuitable, seabirds will emigrate to more productive areas, sometimes permanently if the bird is young. After fledging, juvenile birds often disperse further than adults, and to different areas, so are commonly sighted far from a species&#x27; normal range. Some species, such as the auks, do not have a concerted migration effort, but drift southwards as the winter approaches. Other species, such as some of the storm petrels, diving petrels and cormorants, never disperse at all, staying near their breeding colonies year round.

=== Away from the sea ===
While the definition of seabirds suggests that the birds in question spend their lives on the ocean, many seabird families have many species that spend some or even most of their lives inland away from the sea. Most strikingly, many species breed tens, hundreds or even thousands of miles inland. Some of these species still return to the ocean to feed; for example, the snow petrel, the nests of which have been found inland on the Antarctic mainland, are unlikely to find anything to eat around their breeding sites. The marbled murrelet nests inland in old growth forest, seeking huge conifers with large branches to nest on. Other species, such as the California gull, nest and feed inland on lakes, and then move to the coasts in the winter. Some cormorant, pelican, gull and tern species have individuals that never visit the sea at all, spending their lives on lakes, rivers, swamps and, in the case of some of the gulls, cities and agricultural land. In these cases, it is thought that these terrestrial or freshwater birds evolved from marine ancestors. Some seabirds, principally those that nest in tundra, as skuas and phalaropes do, will migrate over land as well.

The more marine species, such as petrels, auks and gannets, are more restricted in their habits, but are occasionally seen inland as vagrants. This most commonly happens to young inexperienced birds, but can happen in great numbers to exhausted adults after large storms, an event known as a &quot;wreck&quot;.

== Relationship with humans ==

=== Seabirds and fisheries ===
Seabirds have had a long association with both fisheries and sailors, and both have drawn benefits and disadvantages from the relationship.

Fishermen have traditionally used seabirds as indicators of both fish shoals, underwater banks that might indicate fish stocks, and of potential landfall. In fact, the known association of seabirds with land was instrumental in allowing the Polynesians to locate tiny landmasses in the Pacific. Seabirds have provided food for fishermen away from home, as well as bait. Famously, tethered cormorants have been used to catch fish directly. Indirectly, fisheries have also benefited from guano from colonies of seabirds acting as fertilizer for the surrounding seas.

Negative effects on fisheries are mostly restricted to raiding by birds on aquaculture, although long-lining fisheries also have to deal with bait stealing. There have been claims of prey depletion by seabirds of fishery stocks, and while there is some evidence of this, the effects of seabirds are considered smaller than that of marine mammals and predatory fish (like tuna).

Some seabird species have benefited from fisheries, particularly from discarded fish and offal. These discards compose 30% of the food of seabirds in the North Sea, for example, and compose up to 70% of the total food of some seabird populations. This can have other impacts; for example, the spread of the northern fulmar through the United Kingdom is attributed in part to the availability of discards. Discards generally benefit surface feeders, such as gannets and petrels, to the detriment of pursuit divers like penguins and guillemots, which can get entangled in the nets.

Fisheries also have negative effects on seabirds, and these effects, particularly on the long-lived and slow-breeding albatrosses, are a source of increasing concern to conservationists. The bycatch of seabirds entangled in nets or hooked on fishing lines has had a big impact on seabird numbers; for example, an estimated 100,000 albatrosses are hooked and drown each year on tuna lines set out by long-line fisheries. Overall, many hundreds of thousands of birds are trapped and killed each year, a source of concern for some of the rarest species (for example, only about 2,000 short-tailed albatrosses are known to still exist). Seabirds are also thought to suffer when overfishing occurs. Changes to the marine ecosystems caused by dredging, which alters the biodiversity of the seafloor, can also have a negative impact.

=== Exploitation ===
The hunting of seabirds and the collecting of seabird eggs have contributed to the declines of many species, and the extinction of several, including the great auk and the spectacled cormorant. Seabirds have been hunted for food by coastal peoples throughout history—one of the earliest instances known is in southern Chile, where archaeological excavations in middens has shown hunting of albatrosses, cormorants and shearwaters from 5000 BP. This pressure has led to some species becoming extinct in many places; in particular, at least 20 species of an original 29 no longer breed on Easter Island. In the 19th century, the hunting of seabirds for fat deposits and feathers for the millinery trade reached industrial levels. (harvesting shearwater chicks) developed as important industries in both New Zealand and Tasmania, and the name of one species, the providence petrel, is derived from its seemingly miraculous arrival on Norfolk Island where it provided a windfall for starving European settlers. In the Falkland Islands, hundreds of thousands of penguins were harvested for their oil each year. Seabird eggs have also long been an important source of food for sailors undertaking long sea voyages, as well as being taken when settlements grow in areas near a colony. Eggers from San Francisco took almost half a million eggs a year from the Farallon Islands in the mid-19th century, a period in the islands&#x27; history from which the seabird species are still recovering.

Both hunting and egging continue today, although not at the levels that occurred in the past, and generally in a more controlled manner. For example, the Māori of Stewart Island / Rakiura continue to harvest the chicks of the sooty shearwater as they have done for centuries, using traditional stewardship, &quot;kaitiakitanga&quot;, to manage the harvest, but now also work with the University of Otago in studying the populations. In Greenland, however, uncontrolled hunting is pushing many species into steep decline.

=== Other threats ===
Other human factors have led to declines and even extinctions in seabird populations and species. Of these, perhaps the most serious are introduced species. Seabirds, breeding predominantly on small isolated islands, are vulnerable to predators because they have lost many behaviours associated with defence from predators. Feral cats can take seabirds as large as albatrosses, and many introduced rodents, such as the Pacific rat, take eggs hidden in burrows. Introduced goats, cattle, rabbits and other herbivores can create problems, particularly when species need vegetation to protect or shade their young. The disturbance of breeding colonies by humans is often a problem as well—visitors, even well-meaning tourists, can flush brooding adults off a colony, leaving chicks and eggs vulnerable to predators.

The build-up of toxins and pollutants in seabirds is also a concern. Seabirds, being apex predators, suffered from the ravages of the insecticide DDT until it was banned; DDT was implicated, for example, in embryo development problems and the skewed sex ratio of western gulls in southern California. Oil spills are also a threat to seabirds: the oil is toxic, and bird feathers become saturated by the oil, causing them to lose their waterproofing. Oil pollution in particular threatens species with restricted ranges or already depressed populations.

Climate change mainly affect seabirds via changes to their habitat: various processes in the ocean lead to decreased availability of food and colonies are more often flooded as a consequence of sea level rise and extreme rainfall events. Heat stress from extreme temperatures is an additional threat. Some seabirds have used changing wind patterns to forage further and more efficiently.

In 2023, plasticosis, a new disease caused solely by plastics, was discovered in seabirds.
The birds identified as having the disease have scarred digestive tracts from ingesting plastic waste. &quot;When birds ingest small pieces of plastic, they found, it inflames the digestive tract. Over time, the persistent inflammation causes tissues to become scarred and disfigured, affecting digestion, growth and survival.&quot;

=== Conservation ===
The threats faced by seabirds have not gone unnoticed by scientists or the conservation movement. As early as 1903, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt was convinced of the need to declare Pelican Island in Florida a National Wildlife Refuge to protect the bird colonies (including the nesting brown pelicans), and in 1909 he protected the Farallon Islands. Today many important seabird colonies are given some measure of protection, from Heron Island in Australia to Triangle Island in British Columbia.

Island restoration techniques, pioneered by New Zealand, enable the removal of exotic invaders from increasingly large islands. Feral cats have been removed from Ascension Island, Arctic foxes from many islands in the Aleutian Islands, and rats from Campbell Island. The removal of these introduced species has led to increases in numbers of species under pressure and even the return of extirpated ones. After the removal of cats from Ascension Island, seabirds began to nest there again for the first time in over a hundred years.

Seabird mortality caused by long-line fisheries can be greatly reduced by techniques such as setting long-line bait at night, dying the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, increasing the amount of weight on lines and by using bird scarers, and their deployment is increasingly required by many national fishing fleets.

One of the Millennium Projects in the UK was the Scottish Seabird Centre, near the important bird sanctuaries on Bass Rock, Fidra and the surrounding islands. The area is home to huge colonies of gannets, puffins, skuas and other seabirds. The centre allows visitors to watch live video from the islands as well as learn about the threats the birds face and how we can protect them, and has helped to significantly raise the profile of seabird conservation in the UK. Seabird tourism can provide income for coastal communities as well as raise the profile of seabird conservation, although it needs to be managed to ensure it does not harm the colonies and nesting birds. For example, the northern royal albatross colony at Taiaroa Head in New Zealand attracts 40,000 visitors a year.

The plight of albatross and large seabirds, as well as other marine creatures, being taken as bycatch by long-line fisheries, has been addressed by a large number of non-governmental organizations (including BirdLife International, the American Bird Conservancy and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds). This led to the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels, a legally binding treaty designed to protect these threatened species, which has been ratified by thirteen countries as of 2021 (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, France, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, South Africa, Spain, Uruguay, United Kingdom).

=== Role in culture ===

Many seabirds are little studied and poorly known because they live far out at sea and breed in isolated colonies. Some seabirds, particularly the albatrosses and gulls, are more well known to humans. The albatross has been described as &quot;the most legendary of birds&quot;, and have a variety of myths and legends associated with them. While it is widely considered unlucky to harm them, the notion that sailors believed that is a myth that derives from Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s famous poem, &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, in which a sailor is punished for killing an albatross by having to wear its corpse around his neck. Sailors did, however, consider it unlucky to touch a storm petrel, especially one that landed on the ship.

Gulls are one of the most commonly seen seabirds because they frequent human-made habitats (such as cities and dumps) and often show a fearless nature. Gulls have been used as metaphors, as in &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot; by Richard Bach, or to denote a closeness to the sea; in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, they appear in the insignia of Gondor and therefore Númenor (used in the design of the films), and they call Legolas to (and across) the sea. Pelicans have long been associated with mercy and altruism because of an early Christian myth that they split open their breast to feed their starving chicks.

<text>Hygiene is a set of practices performed to preserve health.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), &quot;Hygiene refers to conditions and practices that help to maintain health and prevent the spread of diseases.&quot; Personal hygiene refers to maintaining the body&#x27;s cleanliness. Hygiene activities can be grouped into the following: home and everyday hygiene, personal hygiene, medical hygiene, sleep hygiene, and food hygiene. Home and every day hygiene includes hand washing, respiratory hygiene, food hygiene at home, hygiene in the kitchen, hygiene in the bathroom, laundry hygiene, and medical hygiene at home. And also environmental hygiene in the society to prevent all kinds of bacterias from penetrating into our homes.

Many people equate hygiene with &quot;cleanliness&quot;, but hygiene is a broad term. It includes such personal habit choices as how frequently to take a shower or bath, wash hands, trim fingernails, and wash clothes. It also includes attention to keeping surfaces in the home and workplace clean, including bathroom facilities. Adherence to regular hygiene practices is often regarded as a socially responsible and respectable behavior, while neglecting proper hygiene can be perceived as unclean or unsanitary, and may be considered socially unacceptable or disrespectful, while also posing a risk to public health.
== Definition and overview ==
Hygiene is a practice related to lifestyle, cleanliness, health, and medicine. In medicine and everyday life, hygiene practices are preventive measures that reduce the incidence and spread of germs leading to disease.

Hygiene practices vary from one culture to another.

In the manufacturing of food, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and other products, good hygiene is a critical component of quality assurance.

The terms cleanliness and hygiene are often used interchangeably, which can cause confusion. In general, hygiene refers to practices that prevent spread of disease-causing organisms. Cleaning processes (e.g., handwashing) remove infectious microbes as well as dirt and soil, and are thus often the means to achieve hygiene.

Other uses of the term are as follows: &quot;body hygiene&quot;, &quot;personal hygiene&quot;, &quot;sleep hygiene&quot;, &quot;mental hygiene&quot;, &quot;dental hygiene,&quot; and &quot;occupational hygiene&quot;, used in connection with public health.

=== Home hygiene overview ===
Home hygiene pertains to the hygiene practices that prevent or minimize the spread of disease at home and other everyday settings such as social settings, public transport, the workplace, public places, and more. Hygiene in a variety of settings plays an important role in preventing the spread of infectious diseases. It includes procedures like hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, food and water hygiene, general home hygiene (hygiene of environmental sites and surfaces), care of domestic animals, and home health care (the care of those who are at greater risk of infection).

At present, these components of hygiene tend to be regarded as separate issues, although based on the same underlying microbiological principles. Preventing the spread of diseases means breaking the chain of infection transmission so that infection cannot spread. &quot;Targeted hygiene&quot; is based on identifying the routes of pathogen spread in the home and introducing hygiene practices at critical times to break the chain of infection. It uses a risk-based approach based on Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP).

The main sources of infection in the home are people (who are carriers or are infected), foods (particularly raw foods), water, pets, and domestic animals. Sites that accumulate stagnant water – such as sinks, toilets, waste pipes, cleaning tools, and face cloths – readily support microbial growth and can become secondary reservoirs of infection, though species are mostly those that threaten &quot;at risk&quot; groups. Pathogens (such as potentially infectious bacteria and viruses – colloquially called &quot;germs&quot;) are constantly shed via mucous membranes, feces, vomit, skin scales, and other means. When circumstances combine, people are exposed, either directly or via food or water, and can develop an infection.

The main &quot;highways&quot; for the spread of pathogens in the home are the hands, hand and food contact surfaces, and cleaning cloths and utensils (e.g. fecal–oral route of transmission). Pathogens can also be spread via clothing and household linens, such as towels. Utilities such as toilets and wash basins were invented to deal safely with human waste but still have risks associated with them. Safe disposal of human waste is a fundamental need; poor sanitation is a primary cause of diarrhea disease in low-income communities. Respiratory viruses and fungal spores spread via the air.

Good home hygiene means engaging in hygiene practices at critical points to break the chain of infection. Because the &quot;infectious dose&quot; for some pathogens can be very small (10–100 viable units or even less for some viruses), and infection can result from direct transfer of pathogens from surfaces via hands or food to the mouth, nasal mucous, or the eye, &quot;hygienic cleaning&quot; procedures should be adopted to eliminate pathogens from critical surfaces.
===Hand washing===

===Respiratory hygiene===

Correct respiratory and hand hygiene when coughing and sneezing reduces the spread of pathogens particularly during the cold and flu season:
* Carry tissues and use them to catch coughs and sneezes, or sneeze into your elbow.
* Dispose of tissues as soon as possible.

===Hygiene in the kitchen, bathroom and toilet===
Routine cleaning of hands, food, sites, and surfaces (such as toilet seats and flush handles, door and tap handles, work surfaces, and bath and basin surfaces) in the kitchen, bathroom, and toilet rooms reduces the spread of pathogens. The infection risk from flush toilets is not high, provided they are properly maintained, although some splashing and aerosol formation can occur during flushing, particularly when someone has diarrhea. Pathogens can survive in the scum or scale left behind on baths, showers, and washbasins after washing and bathing.

Thorough cleaning is important to prevent the spread of fungal infections. Molds can live on wall and floor tiles and on shower curtains. Mold can be responsible for infections, cause allergic reactions, deteriorate/damage surfaces, and cause unpleasant odors. Primary sites of fungal growth are inanimate surfaces, including carpets and soft furnishings. Airborne fungi are usually associated with damp conditions, poor ventilation, or closed air systems.

Hygienic cleaning can be done through:
* Mechanical removal (i.e., cleaning) using a soap or detergent. To be effective as a hygiene measure, this process must be followed by thorough rinsing under running water to remove pathogens from the surface.
* Using a process or product that inactivates the pathogens &quot;in situ&quot;. Pathogen kill is achieved using a &quot;micro-biocidal&quot; product, i.e., a disinfectant or antibacterial product; waterless hand sanitizer; or by application of heat.
* In some cases, combined pathogen removal with kill is used, e.g., laundering of clothing and household linens such as towels and bed linen.
* House deep-cleaning an intensive cleaning process targeting often-neglected areas, enhancing aesthetics, and improving health by reducing allergens and bacteria. It typically includes tasks like detailed dusting, appliance cleaning, and carpet shampooing, recommended biannually to maintain a home&#x27;s hygiene and air quality.

===Laundry hygiene===
Laundry hygiene involves practices that prevent disease and its spread via soiled clothing and household linens such as towels. Items most likely to be contaminated with pathogens are those that come into direct contact with the body, e.g., underwear, personal towels, facecloths, nappies. Cloths or other fabric items used during food preparation, or for cleaning the toilet or cleaning up material such as feces or vomit are a particular risk.

Microbiological and epidemiological data indicates that clothing and household linens are a risk factor for infection transmission in home and everyday life settings as well as institutional settings. The lack of quantitative data linking contaminated clothing to infection in the domestic setting makes it difficult to assess the extent of this risk. This also indicates that risks from clothing and household linens are somewhat less than those associated with hands, hand contact and food contact surfaces, and cleaning cloths, but even so these risks need to be managed through effective laundering practices. In the home, this should be carried out as part of a multibarrier approach to hygiene which includes hand, food, respiratory, and other hygiene practices.

Infectious disease risks from contaminated clothing can increase significantly under certain conditions - for example, in healthcare situations in hospitals, care homes, and the domestic setting where someone has diarrhoea, vomiting, or a skin or wound infection. The risk increases in circumstances where someone has reduced immunity to infection.

Hygiene measures, including laundry hygiene, are an important part of reducing spread of antibiotic-resistant strains of infectious organisms. In the community, otherwise-healthy people can become persistent skin carriers of MRSA, or faecal carriers of enterobacteria strains which can carry multi-antibiotic resistance factors (e.g. NDM-1 or ESBL-producing strains). The risks are not apparent until, for example, they are admitted to hospital, when they can become &quot;self infected&quot; with their own resistant organisms following a surgical procedure. As persistent nasal, skin, or bowel carriage in the healthy population spreads &quot;silently&quot; across the world, the risks from resistant strains in both hospitals and the community increases. In particular the data indicates that clothing and household linens are a risk factor for spread of &quot;S. aureus&quot; (including MRSA and PVL-producing MRSA strains), and that effectiveness of laundry processes may be an important factor in defining the rate of community spread of these strains. Experience in the United States suggests that these strains are transmissible within families and in community settings such as prisons, schools, and sport teams. Skin-to-skin contact (including unabraded skin) and indirect contact with contaminated objects such as towels, sheets, and sports equipment seem to represent the mode of transmission.

During laundering, temperature and detergent work to reduce microbial contamination levels on fabrics. Soil and microbes from fabrics are severed and suspended in the wash water. These are then &quot;washed away&quot; during the rinse and spin cycles. In addition to physical removal, micro-organisms can be killed by thermal inactivation which increases as the temperature is increased. Chemical inactivation of microbes by the surfactants and activated oxygen-based bleach used in detergents contributes to the hygiene effectiveness of laundering. Adding hypochlorite bleach in the washing process achieves inactivation of microbes. A number of other factors can contribute including drying and ironing.

Drying laundry on a line in direct sunlight is known to reduce pathogens.

In 2013, the International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene reviewed 30 studies of the hygiene effectiveness of laundering at temperatures ranging from room temperature to , under varying conditions. A key finding was the lack of standardization and control within studies, and the variability in test conditions between studies such as wash cycle time, number of rinses, and other factors. The consequent variability in the data (i.e., the reduction in contamination on fabrics) in turn makes it extremely difficult to propose guidelines for laundering with any confidence. As a result, there is significant variability in the recommendations for hygienic laundering given by different agencies.

===Medical hygiene at home===
Medical hygiene pertains to hygiene practices that prevent or minimize disease and the spreading of disease in relation to administering medical care to those who are infected or who are more at risk of infection in the home. Members of &quot;at-risk&quot; groups are cared for at home by a carer who may be a household member and who requires a good knowledge of hygiene. People with reduced immunity to infection, who are looked after at home, make up an increasing proportion of the population (, up to 20%). The largest proportion are the elderly who have co-morbidities that reduce their immunity to infection. It also includes the very young, patients discharged from hospital, taking immuno-suppressive drugs, or using invasive systems, etc. For patients discharged from hospital, or being treated at home, special &quot;medical hygiene&quot; procedures may need to be performed for them, such as catheter or dressing replacement, which puts them at higher risk of infection.

Antiseptics may be applied to cuts, wounds, and abrasions of the skin to prevent the entry of harmful bacteria that can cause sepsis. Day-to-day hygiene practices, other than special medical hygiene procedures, are no different for those at increased risk of infection than for other family members. The difference is that, if hygiene practices are not correctly carried out, the risk of infection is much greater.

===Disinfectants and antibacterials in home hygiene===
Chemical disinfectants are products that kill pathogens. If the product is a disinfectant, the label on the product should say &quot;disinfectant&quot; or &quot;kills&quot; pathogens. Some commercial products, e.g. bleaches, even though they are technically disinfectants, say that they &quot;kill pathogens&quot; but are not actually labelled as &quot;disinfectants&quot;. Not all disinfectants kill all types of pathogens. All disinfectants kill bacteria (called bactericidal). Some also kill fungi (fungicidal), bacterial spores (sporicidal), or viruses (virucidal).

An antibacterial product acts against bacteria in some unspecified way. Some products labelled &quot;antibacterial&quot; kill bacteria while others may contain a concentration of active ingredient that only prevents them from multiplying. It is, therefore, important to check whether the product label states that it &quot;kills bacteria&quot;. An antibacterial is not necessarily anti-fungal or anti-viral unless this is stated on the label.

The term sanitizer has been used to define substances that both clean and disinfect. More recently this term has been applied to alcohol-based products that disinfect the hands (alcohol hand sanitizers). Alcohol hand sanitizers however are not considered to be effective on soiled hands.

The term biocide is a broad term for a substance that kills, inactivates or otherwise controls living organisms. It includes antiseptics and disinfectants, which combat micro-organisms, and pesticides.

== Personal hygiene ==

===Regular activities===
Personal hygiene involves those practices performed by a person to care for their bodily health and well-being through cleanliness. Motivations for personal hygiene practice include reduction of personal illness, healing from illness, optimal health and sense of wellbeing, social acceptance, and prevention of spread of illness to others. What is considered proper personal hygiene can be culture-specific and may change over time.

Practices that are generally considered proper hygiene include showering or bathing regularly, washing hands regularly and especially before handling food, face washing, washing scalp hair, keeping hair short or removing hair, wearing clean clothing, brushing teeth, and trimming fingernails and toenails. Some practices are sex-specific, such as by a woman during menstruation.

Toiletry bags hold body hygiene and toiletry supplies.

Anal hygiene is the practice that a person performs on their anal area after defecation. The anus and buttocks may be either washed with liquids or wiped with toilet paper, or by adding gel wipe to toilet tissue as an alternative to wet wipes or other solid materials in order to remove remnants of feces.

People tend to develop a routine for attending to their personal hygiene needs. Other personal hygienic practices include covering one&#x27;s mouth when coughing, disposal of soiled tissues appropriately, making sure toilets are clean, and making sure food handling areas are clean, besides other practices. Some cultures do not kiss or shake hands in order to reduce transmission of bacteria by contact.

Personal grooming extends personal hygiene as it pertains to the maintenance of a good personal and public appearance, which need not necessarily be hygienic. It may involve, for example, using deodorants or perfume, shaving, or combing.

===Hygiene of internal ear canals===
Excessive cleaning of the ear canals can result in infection or irritation. The ear canals require less care than other parts of the body because they are sensitive and mostly self-cleaning. There is a slow and orderly migration of the skin lining the ear canal from the eardrum to the outer opening of the ear. Old earwax is constantly being transported from the deeper areas of the ear canal out to the opening where it usually dries, flakes, and falls out. Attempts to clean the ear canals through the removal of earwax can push debris and foreign material into the ear that the natural movement of ear wax out of the ear would have removed.

=== Oral hygiene ===
It is recommended that all healthy adults brush twice a day, softly, with the correct technique, replacing their toothbrush every few months (~3).

There are a number of common oral hygiene misconceptions. The National Health Service (NHS) of England recommends not rinsing the mouth with water after brushing – only to spit out excess toothpaste. They claim that this helps fluoride from toothpaste bond to teeth for its preventative effects against tooth decay. It is also not recommended to brush immediately after drinking acidic substances, including sparkling water. It is also recommended to floss once a day, with a different piece of floss at each flossing session. The effectiveness of amorphous calcium phosphate products, such as Tooth Mousse, is in debate. Visits to a dentist for a checkup every year at least are recommended.

===Sleep hygiene===

Sleep hygiene is the recommended behavioral and environmental practices that promote better quality sleep. These recommendations were developed in the late 1970s as a method to help people with mild to moderate insomnia, but, , the evidence for effectiveness of individual recommendations is &quot;limited and inconclusive&quot;. Clinicians assess the sleep hygiene of people who present with insomnia and other conditions, such as depression, and offer recommendations based on the assessment. Sleep hygiene recommendations include establishing a regular sleep schedule, using naps with care, not exercising physically or mentally too close to bedtime, and avoiding alcohol as well as nicotine, caffeine, and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime. Further recommendations include limiting worry, limiting exposure to light in the hours before sleep, getting out of bed if sleep does not come, not using the bed for anything but sleep, and having a peaceful, comfortable, and dark sleep environment.

=== Personal care services hygiene ===
Personal care services hygiene pertains to the care and use of instruments used in the administration of personal care services to people:

Personal care hygiene practices include:
* sterilization of instruments used by service providers including hairdressers, aestheticians, and other service providers
* sterilization by autoclave of instruments used in body piercing and tattooing
* cleaning hands

===Challenges===
Excessive body hygiene is a possible sign of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Neglecting bodily hygiene, or the cleanliness of one&#x27;s environment, may be a sign of major depression and other psychological disorders.

====Hygiene hypothesis and allergies====

Although media coverage of the hygiene hypothesis has declined, popular folklore continues to sometimes assert that dirt is healthy and hygiene unnatural. This has caused health professionals to be concerned that hygiene behaviors which are the foundation of public health are being undermined. In response to the need for effective hygiene in home and everyday life settings, the International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene developed a &quot;risk-based&quot; or targeted approach to home hygiene that seeks to ensure that hygiene measures are focused on the places and times most critical for infection transmission. While targeted hygiene was originally developed as an effective approach to hygiene practice, it also seeks, as far as possible, to sustain &quot;normal&quot; levels of exposure to the microbial flora of our environment to the extent that is important to build a balanced immune system.

Although there is substantial evidence that some microbial exposures in early childhood can in some way protect against allergies, there is no evidence that humans need exposure to harmful microbes (infection) or that it is necessary to develop a clinical infection. Nor is there evidence that hygiene measures such as hand washing, food hygiene, etc., are linked to increased susceptibility to atopic disease. If this is the case, there is no conflict between the goals of preventing infection and minimizing allergies. that the answer lies in more fundamental changes in lifestyles that have led to decreased exposure to certain microbial or other species, such as helminths, that are important for development of immuno-regulatory mechanisms. There is still much uncertainty as to which lifestyle factors are involved.

== Medical hygiene ==
Medical hygiene pertains to hygiene practices related to the administration of medicine and medical care that prevents or minimizes the spread of disease.

Medical hygiene practices include:
* isolation of infectious persons or materials to prevent spread of infection
* sterilization of instruments used in surgical procedures
* proper bandaging and dressing of injuries
* safe disposal of medical waste
* disinfection of reusables (i.e., linen, pads, uniforms)
* scrubbing up, handwashing, especially in an operating room, but in more general health-care settings as well, where diseases can be transmitted
* ethanol-based sanitizers

Most of these practices were developed in the 19th century and were well-established by the mid-20th century. Some procedures (such as disposal of medical waste) were refined in response to late-20th century disease outbreaks, notably AIDS and Ebola.

== Food hygiene ==
Culinary hygiene (or food hygiene) pertains to practices of food management and cooking that prevent food contamination, prevent food poisoning, and minimize the transmission of disease to other foods, humans, or animals. Culinary hygiene practices specify safe ways to handle, store, prepare, serve, and eat food.

== Hygiene aspects in low- and middle-income countries ==

In developing countries (or low- and middle-income countries), universal access to water and sanitation, coupled with hygiene promotion, is essential in reducing infectious diseases. This approach has been integrated into the Sustainable Development Goal Number 6 whose second target states: &quot;By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations&quot;. Due to their close linkages, water, sanitation, hygiene are together abbreviated and funded under the term WASH in development cooperation.

About two million people die every year due to diarrheal diseases; most of them are children less than five years of age. The most affected are people in developing countries who live in extreme conditions of poverty, normally peri-urban dwellers or rural inhabitants. Providing access to sufficient quantities of safe water and facilities for a sanitary disposal of excreta, and introducing sound hygiene behaviors are important in order to reduce the burden of disease.

Research shows that, if widely practiced, hand washing with soap could reduce diarrhea by almost fifty percent and respiratory infections by nearly twenty-five percent Hand washing with soap also reduces the incidence of skin diseases, and eye infections like trachoma and intestinal worms, especially ascariasis and trichuriasis. Other hygiene practices, such as safe disposal of waste, surface hygiene, and care of domestic animals, are important in low income communities to break the chain of infection transmission.

Cleaning of toilets and hand wash facilities is important to prevent odors and make them socially acceptable. Social acceptance is an important part of encouraging people to use toilets and wash their hands, in situations where open defecation is still seen as a possible alternative, e.g. in rural areas of some developing countries.

=== Household water treatment and safe storage ===

Household water treatment and safe storage ensure drinking water is safe for consumption. These interventions are part of the approach of self-supply of water for households. Drinking water quality remains a significant problem in developing and in developed countries; even in the European region it is estimated that 120 million people do not have access to safe drinking water. Point-of-use water quality interventions can reduce diarrheal disease in communities where water quality is poor or in emergency situations where there is a breakdown in water supply.
Since water can become contaminated during storage at home (e.g. by contact with contaminated hands or using dirty storage vessels), safe storage of water in the home is important.

Methods for treatment of drinking water at the household level include:
* chemical disinfection using chlorine or iodine
* boiling
* filtration using ceramic filters
* solar disinfection — Solar disinfection is an effective method, especially when no chemical disinfectants are available.
* UV irradiation — Community or household UV systems may be batch or flow-though. The lamps can be suspended above the water channel or submerged in the water flow.
* combined flocculation/disinfection systems — available as sachets of powder that act by coagulating and flocculating sediments in water followed by release of chlorine
* multibarrier methods — Some systems use two or more of the above treatments in combination or in succession to optimize efficacy.
* portable water purification devices

==History==


===Asia===
====China====
Bathing culture in Chinese literature can be traced back to the Shang dynasty (), when Oracle bone inscriptions describe people washing their hair and body in a bath. The &quot;Book of Rites&quot;, a work regarding Zhou dynasty () ritual, politics, and culture compiled during the Warring States period, recommends that people take a hot shower every five days, and wash their hair every three days. It was also considered good manners to take a bath provided by the host before a dinner. In the Han dynasty, bathing became a regular activity, and for government officials bathing was required every five days.

Ancient bath facilities have been found in ancient Chinese cities, such as Dongzhouyang archaeological site in Henan Province. Bathrooms were called (), and bathtubs were made of bronze or timber. Bath beans – a powdery soap mixture of ground beans, cloves, eaglewood, flowers, and even powdered jade – were recorded in the Han Dynasty. Bath beans were considered luxury toiletries, while common people simply used powdered beans without spices mixed in. Luxurious bathhouses built around hot springs were recorded in Tang dynasty. While royal bathhouses and bathrooms were common among ancient Chinese nobles and commoners, public bathhouses were a relatively late development. In the Song dynasty (), public bathhouses became popular and people could find them readily. Bathing became an essential part of social life and recreation. Bathhouses often provided massage, nail cutting service, rubdown service, ear cleaning, food, and beverages. Marco Polo, who traveled to China during the Yuan dynasty, noted Chinese bathhouses were using coal to heat the bathhouse, which he had never seen before in Europe. Coal was so plentiful that Chinese people of every social class had bathrooms in their houses, and people took showers every day in the winter for enjoyment.

A typical Ming dynasty bathhouse had slabbed floors and brick domed ceilings. A huge boiler would be installed in the back of the house, connected with the bathing pool through a tunnel. Water could be pumped into the pool by turning wheels attended by the staff.

==== Japan ====
The origin of Japanese bathing is , ritual purification with water.

In the Heian period (), houses of prominent families, such as the families of court nobles or samurai, had baths. The bath had lost its religious significance and instead became leisure. became (to bathe in a shallow wooden tub). In the 17th century, the first European visitors to Japan recorded the habit of daily baths in mixed sex groups.

==== Indian subcontinent ====
The earliest written account of elaborate codes of hygiene can be found in several Hindu texts, such as the Manusmriti and the Vishnu Purana. Bathing is one of the five (daily duties) in Hinduism, and not performing it leads to sin, according to some scriptures.

Ayurveda is a system of medicine developed in ancient times that is still practiced in India, mostly combined with conventional Western medicine. Contemporary Ayurveda stresses a sattvic diet and good digestion and excretion. Hygiene measures include oil pulling, and tongue scraping. Detoxification also plays an important role.

===The Americas===
====Mesoamerica====

Spanish chronicles describe the bathing habits of the peoples of Mesoamerica during and after the conquest.
Bernal Díaz del Castillo describes Moctezuma (the Mexica, or Aztec, emperor at the arrival of Cortés) in his as being &quot;...Very neat and cleanly, bathing every day each afternoon...&quot;.

Bathing was not restricted to the elite, but was practiced by all people; the chronicler Tomás López Medel wrote after a journey to Central America that &quot; and the custom of washing oneself is so quotidian [common] amongst the Indians, both of cold and hot lands, as is eating, and this is done in fountains and rivers and other water to which they have access, without anything other than pure water...&quot;

The Mesoamerican bath, known as in Spanish, from the Nahuatl word , a compound of (&quot;steam&quot;) and (&quot;house&quot;), consists of a room, often in the form of a small dome, with an exterior firebox known as () that heats a small portion of the room&#x27;s wall made of volcanic rocks; after this wall has been heated, water is poured on it to produce steam, an action known as . As the steam accumulates in the upper part of the room a person in charge uses a bough to direct the steam to the bathers who are lying on the ground, with which he later gives them a massage, then the bathers scrub themselves with a small flat river stone and finally the person in charge introduces buckets with water along with soap and grass used to rinse. This bath had also ritual importance, and was tied to the goddess Toci; it is also therapeutic when medicinal herbs are used in the water for the . It is still used in Mexico.

===Europe===

====Antiquity====

Regular bathing was a hallmark of Roman civilization. Elaborate baths were constructed in urban areas to serve the public, who typically demanded the infrastructure to maintain personal cleanliness. The complexes usually consisted of large, swimming pool-like baths, smaller cold and hot pools, saunas, and spa-like facilities where people could be depilated, oiled, and massaged. Water was constantly changed by an aqueduct-fed flow. Bathing outside of urban centers involved smaller, less elaborate bathing facilities, or simply the use of clean bodies of water. Roman cities also had large sewers, such as Rome&#x27;s Cloaca Maxima, into which public and private latrines drained. Romans did not have demand-flush toilets but did have some toilets with a continuous flow of water under them. The Romans used scented oils (mostly from Egypt), among other alternatives.

Christianity has always placed a strong emphasis on hygiene. Despite rejecting mixed bathing, early Christian clergy encouraged believers to bath, which contributed to hygiene and good health according to the Church Fathers Clement of Alexandria and Tertullian. The Church built public bathing facilities that were separated by sex near monasteries and pilgrimage sites. 

====Middle Ages====
Contrary to popular belief, bathing and sanitation were not lost in Europe with the collapse of the Roman Empire. Starting in the early Middle Ages, popes situated baths within church basilicas and monasteries. Pope Gregory the Great promoted bathing as a bodily need. The use of water in many Christian countries is partly due to Biblical toilet etiquette which encourages washing after all instances of defecation. Bidet and bidet showers were used in regions where water was considered essential for anal cleansing. Public bathhouses were common in medieval Christendom larger towns and cities such as Constantinople, Paris, Regensburg, Rome and Naples.

In the 11th and 12th centuries, bathing was essential to the Western European upper class: the Cluniac monasteries (popular centers for resorting and retiring) were always equipped with bathhouses. These baths were also used ritually when the monks took full immersion baths at the two Christian festivals of renewal. The rules of the Augustinians and Benedictines contained references to ritual purification, and, inspired by Benedict of Nursia, encouraged the practice of therapeutic bathing. Benedictine monks also played a role in the development and promotion of spas.

On the other hand, bathing also sparked erotic phantasies, played upon by the writers of romances intended for the upper class; in the tale of Melusine the bath was a crucial element of the plot.
 Cities regulated public bathing – the 26 public baths of Paris in the late 13th century were strictly overseen by the civil authorities and guild laws banned prostitutes from bathhouse admission. 

In 14th century Tuscany, newlywed couples commonly took a bath together and we find an illustration of this custom in a fresco in the town hall of San Gimignano. 
As evident in Hans Folz&#x27; &quot;Bath Booklet&quot; (a late 15th century guide on European baths) and various artistic depictions such as Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s &quot;Women&#x27;s Bath&quot; , public bathing continued to be a popular past time in the Renaissance. In Britain, the rise of Protestantism also played a prominent role in the development of spa culture.

====Modernity====
Until the late 19th century, only the elite in Western cities typically possessed indoor facilities for relieving bodily functions. The poorer majority used communal facilities built above cesspools in backyards and courtyards. This changed after Dr. John Snow discovered that cholera was transmitted by the fecal contamination of water. Though it took decades for his findings to gain wide acceptance, governments and sanitary reformers were eventually convinced of the health benefits of using sewers to keep human waste from contaminating the water. This encouraged the widespread adoption of both the flush toilet and the moral imperative that bathrooms should be indoors and as private as possible.

Modern sanitation was not widely adopted until the 19th and 20th centuries. According to medieval historian Lynn Thorndike, people in Medieval Europe probably bathed more than people did in the 19th century. Some time after Louis Pasteur&#x27;s experiments proved the germ theory of disease and Joseph Lister and others put this into practice in sanitation, hygienic practices came to be regarded as synonymous with health, as they are in modern times.

The importance of hand washing for human healthparticularly for people in vulnerable circumstances like mothers who had just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitalswas first recognized in the mid 19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English &quot;founder of modern nursing&quot;. At that time most people still believed that infections were caused by foul odors called miasmas.

===Middle East===

Islam stresses the importance of cleanliness and personal hygiene. Islamic hygienical jurisprudence, which dates back to the 7th century, has a number of elaborate rules. (ritual purity) involves performing (ablution) for the five daily (prayers), as well as regularly performing (bathing), which led to bathhouses being built across the Islamic world. Islamic toilet hygiene also requires washing with water after using the toilet, for purity and to minimize pathogens.

In the Abbasid Caliphate (8th–13th centuries), its capital city of Baghdad (Iraq) had 65,000 baths, along with a sewer system. Cities and towns of the medieval Islamic world had water supply systems powered by hydraulic technology that supplied drinking water along with much greater quantities of water for ritual washing, mainly in mosques and hammams (baths). Bathing establishments in various cities were rated by Arabic writers in travel guides. Medieval Islamic cities such as Baghdad, Córdoba (Islamic Spain), Fez (Morocco), and Fustat (Egypt) also had sophisticated waste disposal and sewage systems with interconnected networks of sewers. The city of Fustat also had multi-storey tenement buildings (with up to six floors) with flush toilets, which were connected to a water supply system, and flues on each floor carrying waste to underground channels.

A basic form of contagion theory dates back to the Persian medicine in the medieval, where it was proposed by Persian physician Ibn Sina (also known as Avicenna) in &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot; (1025), the most authoritative medical textbook of the Middle Ages. He mentioned that people can transmit disease to others by breath, noted contagion with tuberculosis, and discussed the transmission of disease through water and dirt. The concept of invisible contagion was eventually widely accepted by Islamic scholars. In the Ayyubid Sultanate, they referred to them as (&quot;impure substances&quot;). The scholar Ibn al-Haj al-Abdari (), while discussing Islamic diet and hygiene, gave advice and warnings about how contagion can contaminate water, food, and garments, and could spread through the water supply.

In the 9th century, Ziryab invented a type of deodorant. He also promoted morning and evening baths, and emphasized the maintenance of personal hygiene. Ziryab is thought to have invented a type of toothpaste, which he popularized throughout Islamic Iberia. The exact ingredients of this toothpaste are not known, but it was reported to have been both &quot;functional and pleasant to taste.&quot;

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
In West Africa, various ethnic groups such as the Yoruba have used black soap to treat skin diseases.

In Southern Africa, the Zulu people conducted methods of sanitation by using water stored in pottery at Ulundi. The Himba people of Namibia and Angola also utilized mixtures of smoke and otjitze treat skin diseases in regions where water is scarce.

=== Soap and soap makers ===
Hard toilet soap with a pleasant smell was invented in the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age when soap-making became an established industry. Recipes for soap-making are described by Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (), who also gave a recipe for producing glycerine from olive oil. In the Middle East, soap was produced from the interaction of fatty oils and fats with alkali. In Syria, soap was produced using olive oil together with alkali and lime. Soap was exported from Syria to other parts of the Muslim world and to Europe. Two key Islamic innovations in soapmaking was the invention of bar soap, described by al-Razi, and the addition of scents using perfume technology perfected in the Islamic world.

By the 15th century, the manufacture of soap in Christendom had become virtually industrialized, with sources in Antwerp, Castile, Marseille, Naples, and Venice. In the 17th century the Spanish Catholic manufacturers purchased the monopoly on Castile soap from the cash-strapped Carolinian government. Industrially-manufactured bar soaps became available in the late 18th century, as advertising campaigns in Europe and America promoted popular awareness of the relationship between cleanliness and health.

A major contribution of the Christian missionaries in Africa, China, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Korea, and other places was better health care through hygiene and introducing and distributing soap, and &quot;cleanliness and hygiene became an important marker of being identified as a Christian&quot;.

==Society and culture==
===Religious hygienic customs===

Many religions require or encourage ritual purification via bathing or immersing the hands in water. In Islam, washing oneself via or is necessary for performing prayer. Islamic tradition also lists a variety of rules concerning proper hygiene after using the bathroom. The Baháʼí Faith mandates the washing of the hands and face prior to the obligatory Baháʼí prayers. Orthodox Judaism requires a bath following menstruation and childbirth, while washing the hands is performed upon waking up and before eating bread. Water plays a role in Christian rituals as well, and in certain denominations of Christianity such as the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church which prescribes several kinds of hand washing for example after leaving the latrine, lavatory, or bathhouse, or before prayer, or after eating a meal, or ritual handwashing.

== Etymology ==
First attested in English in 1676, the word &quot;hygiene&quot; comes from the French , the latinisation of the Greek () , meaning &quot;(art) of health&quot;, from , &quot;good for the health, healthy&quot;, in turn from (), &quot;healthful, sound, salutary, wholesome&quot;. In ancient Greek religion, Hygeia () was the personification of health, cleanliness, and hygiene.

<doc id="147026" wikidata="Q1738733" url="?curid=147026" title="West Coast Swing">
<text>West Coast Swing is a partner dance with roots in Lindy Hop, characterized by an elastic look that results from its extension-compression technique of partner connection. It is danced primarily in a slotted area on the dance floor. The dance allows for both partners to improvise steps while dancing together, putting West Coast Swing in a short list of dances that emphasize improvisation.

Typically the follower is led forward into new patterns traveling forward on counts &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; of each basic pattern, rather than rocking back. Traditional figures include 6-count and 8-count patterns of one of the four basic varieties: (1) Starter Step, (2) Side Pass, (3) Push Break / Sugar Push, (4) Whip. The Anchor Step is a common ending pattern of many West Coast Swing figures.

Alternatively the basic patterns in West Coast Swing are defined as: Push Break (or Sugar Push); Left Side Pass; Right Side Pass; Tuck Turn; and Whip. Virtually all other moves in West Coast Swing are variations of these basic patterns.

West Coast Swing has the leader using &quot;body leads&quot; versus the &quot;arm leads&quot; of East Coast Swing.

==History==
The origins of the West Coast Swing are in the Lindy Hop. Western swing, country boogie, and, with a smaller audience, jump blues were popular on the West Coast throughout the 1940s and into the 1950s when they were renamed and marketed as rock and roll in 1954. Dancers danced &quot;a &#x27;swingier&#x27; more smooth and subdued&quot; form of jitterbug to Western swing music.

Dean Collins, a lindy hop dancer who arrived in the Los Angeles area around 1937, was influential in developing the style of swing dance on the West Coast of the United States as both a performer and teacher. Collins was humble about his contributions to the style. According to one of his former students, a member of his last dance troupe, Collins himself said that he had nothing to do with the West Coast Swing style.

Lessons in &quot;The New West Coast Swing&quot; were offered at the Arthur Murray Dance Studios in San Bernardino and Riverside, California in December 1948. By 1954 West Coast Swing was taught from Southern California to Vancouver B.C. and from Eastern Washington to Hawaii. By 1957 the dance had reached as far east as Missouri. 

Laure&#x27; Haile, an Arthur Murray Dance Studio National Dance Director, documented the unique style of swing dancing in Los Angeles in 1951 using the name &quot;Western Swing&quot; to describe it. Arthur Murray Dance Studios developed a syllabus for West Coast Swing from her notes. The Arthur Murray style taught Western Swing beginning from a closed position and the possibility of dancing single, double, or triple rhythm. After &quot;Throwout&quot; patterns began with the woman &quot;walking in&quot; and the man doing a &quot;rock step&quot;, or step together for counts one and two. Although the dance remained basically the same, the Golden State Dance Teachers Association (GSDTA) began teaching from the walk steps, counts 1 and 2. It replaced Laure Haile&#x27;s Coaster Step with an &quot;Anchor Step&quot; around 1961.

&quot;West Coast Swing&quot; as a synonym for &quot;Western swing&quot; appears in a 1961 dance book. The name was used in an advertisement by ballroom dancer Skippy Blair circa 1958–1962. However, the term wasn&#x27;t incorporated into mainstream swing circles until the late 1960s. Blair preferred the name &quot;West Coast Swing&quot; because of the ambiguous meaning of &quot;Western&quot; (in dance, usually referring to country and western), as distinguished from &quot;West Coast,&quot; referring to California, where the style was actually developed. Blair credits Jim Bannister, editor of the &quot;Herald American&quot; newspaper in Downey, California, for suggesting the name West Coast Swing.

While teenagers preferred to dance freestyle through a constantly changing succession of discotheque social dance fads during the 1960s, adults kept swing alive. In the mid-1970s, the advent of disco music revitalized partner dancing. In California, West Coast Swing was one of the popular dances of the era. By 1978, &quot;California Swing&quot; had developed as a variation of West Coast Swing, with styling that Blair wrote was &quot;considered more UP, with a more Contemporary flavor.&quot; By 1978 GSDTA had &quot;some 200 or more patterns and variations&quot; for West Coast Swing.&quot;

In 1988, West Coast Swing was pronounced the Official State Dance of California.

When Disco fell out of favor, West Coast Swing was one of the dances done in country western bars in Los Angeles. and an instructional booklet for the dance was advertised with a heading of &quot;Cowboy Dancing!&quot;.
By the 1990s country western dancers were dancing West Coast Swing to contemporary country western songs. 

== Slot ==

West Coast Swing is a slotted dance, which means that the steps of the dance are confined to an imaginary &quot;slot&quot; on the dance floor. For West Coast Swing, the slot is a long, thin, rectangular area whose length depends on the tempo of the music – it can be eight or nine feet long for slower songs, but will be shorter for faster music. The follower travels back and forth in the slot, while the leader moves only minimally. When the follower reaches the leader, the leader moves a minimal amount (at mid-way point) to the side, barely out of the follower&#x27;s way. The follower in turn lightly brushes against the leader each time they pass.

The use of the &quot;dance slot&quot; for energetic and improvisational dances like the West Coast Swing allows for dancers to dance on a crowded dance floor without colliding with other couples; remaining within one&#x27;s slot is considered proper etiquette. Couples usually establish their own slot parallel with dancers who have already established a space on the dance floor. If the dance floor is not crowded and the couple is afforded more space, such as during a competitive event, the dancers may move the slot around the floor more liberally.

There are urban myths regarding the origin of the slotted style. According to one version, it was an invention of Hollywood film makers who wanted &quot;dancers to stay in the same plane, to avoid going in and out of focus&quot;.

== Associated musical styles ==
West Coast Swing can be traced to the swing era of jazz. During this period many jazz, blues, and country musicians incorporated swing in their music. Writing in the &quot;Arthur Murray Silver Dance Notebook&quot;, Laure Haile, who first described &quot;Western Swing&quot;, listed the following songs as &quot;Good Swing or Fox Trot Records&quot;:

* &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; by Ray Anthony ((Capitol L-258)(1951))
* &quot;Be-Bop&#x27;s Spoken Here&quot; by Les Brown Columbia 38499 (4/14/49)
* &quot;One Mint Julep&quot;, Buddy Morrow, Victor 20-4869 (June/July 1952)
* &quot;Dry Bones&quot;, Tommy Dorsey, Victor 20-3523 (1949?)
Western Swing was documented in the 1971 edition of the &quot;Encyclopedia of Social Dance&quot;, listing the &quot;Coaster Step&quot; (with a forward step as the last step of the second triple) rather than the Anchor Step. The one song that was listed for this dance was &quot;Comin&#x27; On&quot; by Bill Black&#x27;s Combo (1964 Hi #2072).

West Coast Swing can be danced to almost any music written in time. In the past, the ideal speed for West Coast Swing was cited as 32 measures per minute or 128 bpm, compared to the recommended 112 bpm for Western Swing. In its 2014–2016 rules, the United Country Western Dance Council (UCWDC) specified a range of 102–114 bpm with a preferred speed of 108 bpm &quot;for all.&quot; West Coast Swing dancers have adopted music genres such as hip hop and blues, both of which often range well below 100 bpm.

==Basic guidelines==
West Coast Swing is an evolving social dance that has gone through many changes throughout its short history, over time incorporating techniques from numerous dance styles. However, there are many guidelines that should be followed to maintain the true character of the dance. A dance&#x27;s character is typically defined by a basic philosophy, principles of movement, and traditional steps and figures. While these guidelines can be violated, by committing too many violations one risks departing from the defining features of the dance.

Modern West Coast Swing is in large part defined by an emphasis on musicality and connection. Movement is based on a principle borrowed from ballroom and Latin dance in which the dancer moves their center of gravity immediately over the foot when a weight transfer is desired. Traditional figures include 6-count and 8-count patterns of one of the four basic varieties: (1) Starter Step, (2) Side Pass, (3) Push Break / Sugar Push, (4) Whip. Many common West Coast Swing figures are derived from simple variations of these basic figures. West Coast Swing is also a fundamentally improvised dance, and thus such defined figures are simply starting points for the skilled dancer. Additionally, West Coast Swing can be said to rely on the leader creating and redirecting the momentum of the follower in order to communicate how they wish to lead the dance. The follower&#x27;s step is different from the leader&#x27;s; partners do not mirror each other.

Dancing to different types of music gives a different feel and look. In writing about West Coast Swing, Skippy Blair said, &quot;The only problem that exists in swing is when someone decides there is only one way to dance it. There is never only one way to do anything.&quot; In 1994 Blair noted that the posture for men had trended to be more upright than in previous years.

A 1998 summary of trends in West Coast Swing distinguished the traditional or classic style from modern variations as follows:
* &quot;Traditional/Classic:&quot; minimal extension of the free arm, the leader moves off and on the center of the track for most moves
* &quot;Modern&quot;: the free arm may be extended for style, emphasis on large number of spins and other flourishes

===Basic figures===
The following are some examples of basic West Coast Swing patterns. Most are performed with the same &quot;step step tri-ple-step tri-ple-step&quot; pattern equalling eight steps in six beats of music. The term &quot;count&quot; is used as a synonym for a &quot;beat&quot;, usually a quarter note, of music.
*Underarm pass: Also called the right-side pass. A six-count basic where the follower is led to the other end of the slot, passing on the leader&#x27;s right (right side pass), typically under the leader&#x27;s arm (underarm pass).
* Left-side pass: A six-count basic where the follower is led to the other end of the slot, passing on the leader&#x27;s left.
* Tuck pass: Similar to a left side pass in six counts, except that the leader creates a &quot;tuck&quot; action on the second count by turning the follower towards themselves and then reversing their direction back toward the slot on the fourth count. Then the follower turns under the leader&#x27;s left arm – either a half turn or a turn and a half – on the final two counts.
* Sugar push: Also called the &quot;push break&quot; or &quot;six-count basic&quot;. In this six-count move, the follower, facing the leader, is led from the end of the slot to a one- or two-hand hold, then led back to the same end of the slot. The deceptively simple pattern requires &quot;compression&quot; or &quot;resistance&quot; with firm but flexible arms, and no excessive pushing or pulling . While the arms remain firm but flexible, there should be no excessive pushing or pulling in the arms but in the body. The Sugar Push has been around since 1952. 
* Whip: An eight-count basic with many variations. In a basic whip, the follower is led past the leader and then redirected (or &quot;whipped&quot;) back towards the end of slot from which they started. The basic footwork for a whip extends the six-count pattern by inserting a pair of walking steps between the triple steps. The footwork is therefore &quot;step step tri-ple-step step step tri-ple-step.&quot; The whip is an evolution of the Lindy Hop basic, but with a smoother and more grounded west coast swing interpretation.

== Global spread ==

West Coast Swing is danced all over the world. It is most popular in the United States, and has spread across the country since its inception.

Internationally, West Coast Swing is popular in France, Russia, Germany, Switzerland, Israel, Iceland, New Zealand, Australia, Austria, Poland, Singapore, Hungary, Romania, Latvia, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Netherlands, Finland, Belarus, Panama City, and the United Kingdom.

<text>A chemical property is any of a material&#x27;s properties that becomes evident during, or after, a chemical reaction; that is, any attribute that can be established only by changing a substance&#x27;s chemical identity. Simply speaking, chemical properties cannot be determined just by viewing or touching the substance; the substance&#x27;s internal structure must be affected greatly for its chemical properties to be investigated. When a substance goes under a chemical reaction, the properties will change drastically, resulting in chemical change. However, a catalytic property would also be a chemical property.

Chemical properties can be contrasted with physical properties, which can be discerned without changing the substance&#x27;s structure. However, for many properties within the scope of physical chemistry, and other disciplines at the boundary between chemistry and physics, the distinction may be a matter of researcher&#x27;s perspective. Material properties, both physical and chemical, can be viewed as supervenient; i.e., secondary to the underlying reality. Several layers of superveniency are possible.

Chemical properties can be used for building chemical classifications. They can also be useful to identify an unknown substance or to separate or purify it from other substances. Materials science will normally consider the chemical properties of a substance to guide its applications.

== Examples ==
* Heat of combustion
* Enthalpy of formation
* Toxicity
* Chemical stability in a given environment
* Flammability (the ability to burn)
* Preferred oxidation state(s)
* Ability to corrode
* Combustibility
* Acidity and basicity
* creation of a new substance(s)
*The ability to melt

<doc id="147035" wikidata="Q2613808" url="?curid=147035" title="Squamish Five">
<text>The Squamish Five (sometimes referred to as the Vancouver Five) were a group of self-styled &quot;urban guerrillas&quot; active in Canada during the early 1980s. Their chosen name was Direct Action. The five were Ann Hansen, Brent Taylor, Juliet Caroline Belmas, Doug Stewart and Gerry Hannah.

== Campaigns ==
The group&#x27;s first action was in 1982: vandalizing the British Columbia Ministry of Environment offices. They began training with stolen weapons in a deserted area north of Vancouver and stole a large cache of dynamite belonging to the Department of Highways.

On the morning of May 30, 1982, Hansen, Taylor, and Stewart travelled to Vancouver Island and set off a large bomb at the Dunsmuir BC Hydro substation. The damage was extensive, causing over $3 million CAD in damage and leaving four transformers damaged beyond repair. Nobody was injured.

=== Litton Industries bombing ===
In October 1982, the five filled a stolen pick-up truck with of dynamite and drove from Vancouver to Toronto. Their target was Litton Industries, a company producing guidance components for the controversial American cruise missiles many feared would increase the risk of nuclear war.

=== &quot;Wimmin&#x27;s Fire Brigade&quot; and Red Hot Video firebombing ===
The bombers fled Toronto for Vancouver and ceased their activities as they moved underground together. On November 22, 1982, they emerged as part of a larger group under the name &quot;Wimmin&#x27;s Fire Brigade&quot;. They subsequently firebombed three franchises of Red Hot Video, a chain of video pornography stores which had attracted the attention of feminist activists and the local community and was accused of selling snuff films as well as violent and paedophilic pornography. The majority of the stores closed or changed names.

Ann Hansen alleges in her memoirs that the police were surveilling them at the time of the Red Hot Video action, which would mean the police broke the law to get the evidence needed to proceed with the charges on the earlier bombings.

== Arrest and trial ==
The high-profile crimes attracted major police attention and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) was closing in. On the morning of January 20, 1983, an RCMP tactical unit disguised as a road crew captured all five on the road to their training area.

Punk band D.O.A released a pair of benefit singles, &quot;Right to Be Wild&quot; and &quot;Burn It Down&quot;, for the arrested members.

== Legacy ==

After prison, Juliet Belmas attended Emily Carr University of Art and Design, and completed a degree in film. She produced independent art films on the conditions of women in prison and was working on her memoirs as of 2012.

In 1987, experimental filmmaker Oliver Hockenhull released &quot;Determinations&quot;, an avant-garde documentary which criticized the political undertones in media coverage of the Squamish Five.

In 1988, CBC Television released an award winning docudrama entitled &quot;The Squamish Five&quot;. The film&#x27;s cast included Nicky Guadagni as Ann Hansen, Michael McManus as Brent Taylor, Robyn Stevan as Juliet Belmas, Albert Schultz as Doug Stewart, and David McLeod as Gerry Hannah.

<text>Emanuel David &quot;Manu&quot; Ginóbili ( , ; born 28 July 1977) is an Argentine former professional basketball player. Credited for popularizing the Euro step move in the NBA, he is regarded as one of the greatest shooting guards and sixth men in the league&#x27;s history and as the greatest Latin American player of all time and is often considered one of the greatest draft steals in NBA history, along with Nikola Jokić. Ginóbili notably led Argentina to a gold medal-winning the FIBA Olympics MVP award in Athens 2004, and achieving with his team the only elimination of a US NBA team in the history of this competition. Over a 23-year professional career, Ginóbili became one of only two players (along with fellow Hall of Famer Bill Bradley) to have won a EuroLeague title, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal. A four-time NBA champion, Ginóbili was a member of the San Antonio Spurs for his entire 16-year NBA career. Along with Spurs teammates Tim Duncan and Tony Parker, Ginóbili was known as one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; during the Spurs&#x27; era of success. During their playing years together, the Spurs became a &quot;model franchise&quot; for other NBA teams. Since September 2021, Ginóbili had been appointed as special advisor to basketball operations for the Spurs.

Ginóbili comes from a family of professional basketball players. He spent the early part of his career in Argentina and Italy, winning several individual and team honors. Ginóbili&#x27;s stint with Italian club Kinder Bologna was particularly successful as he won two Italian League MVP awards, the EuroLeague Finals MVP, and the 2001 EuroLeague championship and Triple Crown.

Selected as the 57th overall pick in the 1999 NBA draft, Ginóbili joined the Spurs in 2002 and soon became a key player for the team. In addition to his four NBA championships, Ginóbili was named an All-Star in 2005 and 2011 and was selected twice for the All-NBA Third Team. In 2007–08, he was named the NBA Sixth Man of the Year. Ginóbili announced his retirement from the NBA in August 2018. In April 2022, he was announced as a first ballot inductee into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

==Family and personal life==
Ginóbili comes from a family of basketball players. His oldest brother, Leandro, retired in 2003 after seven years in the Argentine basketball league, while brother Sebastián has played in both the Argentine local league and in the Spanish 2nd-tier level Liga Española de Baloncesto. Their father, Jorge, was a coach at a club in Bahía Blanca, Argentina, where Ginóbili learned to play the game. Given the proliferation of basketball clubs in Bahía Blanca and his idolization of Michael Jordan, Ginóbili&#x27;s love for basketball grew rapidly.

Ginóbili has dual citizenship in Argentina and Italy, thanks to his Marchesan descent. He speaks Italian and English fluently in addition to his native Spanish. In his free time, Ginóbili enjoys listening to Latin music, watching movies, and traveling. In 2004, he married fellow Argentine Marianela Oroño. On 16 May 2010, his wife gave birth to twin boys, Dante and Nicola. On 21 April 2014, she gave birth to their third son, Luca.

In the immediate aftermath of the legalization of same-sex marriage in Argentina in 2010, Ginóbili expressed his support for the bill, and added that while supportive of same-sex marriage, Ginóbili did not &quot;consider himself qualified&quot; to speak about same-sex adoption. He said that he would prefer to see a child being raised by two men or two women rather than to see that child in an orphanage. In March 2020, Ginóbili also expressed support for gay people playing basketball and expressed hope that the issue of sexual orientation will no longer be important soon. A documentary based on his life was directed by Rodolfo Lamboglia.

==Professional career==

===Andino (1995–1996)===
Ginóbili made his professional debut in the Argentine basketball league for the Andino Sport Club of La Rioja in the 1995–96 season.

=== Estudiantes de Bahía Blanca (1996–1998) ===
Ginóbili was traded to Estudiantes de Bahía Blanca in 1996. He played with his hometown team until 1998.

=== Viola Reggio Calabria (1998–2000) ===
Ginóbili went to Europe to spend the 1998–99 and 1999–2000 seasons with Italian team Basket Viola Reggio Calabria. In 1999, he teamed with Brent Scott, Brian Oliver and Sydney Johnson to earn promotion from the Italian 2nd Division to the Italian 1st Division.

=== Virtus Bologna (2000–2002) ===
Ginóbili then entered the 1999 NBA draft and the San Antonio Spurs selected him late in the second round with the 57th overall pick. However, Ginóbili did not sign with the Spurs at this point. Instead, he returned to Italy to play for Kinder Bologna, whom he helped win the 2001 Italian League Championship, the 2001 and 2002 Italian Cups, and the 2001 EuroLeague. In the lattermost, Ginóbili was named the 2001 EuroLeague&#x27;s Finals MVP. He was also named the Italian League MVP in 2000–01 and 2001–02, and made the Italian League&#x27;s All-Star Game three times during this period.

While playing with the Argentina national team at the 2002 FIBA World Championship in Indianapolis, Ginóbili made the All-Tournament Team, alongside future NBA star Yao Ming and established NBA stars Dirk Nowitzki and Peja Stojaković, and helped lead Argentina to a second-place finish.

===San Antonio Spurs (2002–2018)===

====Early NBA career and first championship (2002–2004)====

Ginóbili joined the Spurs for the 2002–03 NBA season, where he played backup for veteran guard Steve Smith. Ginóbili spent much of the early season injured, and found it hard to adjust to the NBA&#x27;s style of play. As his injury improved, so did Ginóbili, winning the Western Conference Rookie of the Month in March, and being named to the All-Rookie Second Team at the end of the season. Still, he only started in five games as the Spurs chalked up a 60–22 regular season win–loss record. The Spurs then entered the playoffs eager to upend the defending champions Los Angeles Lakers, at which point Ginóbili rose to prominence.

In contrast to his regular season, Ginóbili became an integral part of Gregg Popovich&#x27;s rotation in the playoffs, playing in every game. The Spurs eliminated Phoenix and Los Angeles and in those games, Ginóbili&#x27;s scoring threat took opponents by surprise, giving them one more thing to cope with against the now highly favored Spurs. He helped guide them past the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals and then the New Jersey Nets in the Finals, securing San Antonio&#x27;s second championship. After the win, Ginóbili won his first &quot;Olimpia de Oro&quot; (&quot;Golden Olympia&quot;) as Argentina&#x27;s sportsperson of the year, and met Argentine president Néstor Kirchner. A gym in Bahía Blanca was also dedicated in Ginóbili&#x27;s honor.

In the 2003–04 season, the Spurs began featuring Ginóbili more prominently, starting him in half of the 77 regular season games in which he played. Ginóbili&#x27;s statistics improved in all major categories, as he averaged 12.8 points, 4.5 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.8 steals per game. During the 2004 playoffs, the Spurs lost again to the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Semifinals. Following Game 5 where Derek Fisher scored a buzzer-beating jump shot, the Spurs lost Game 6 and the series 4–2. While Ginóbili did not start in a single playoff game as he did in 2003, his playoff statistics improved significantly, with 13.0 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 3.1 assists per game.

====Peak years: second and third championships (2004–2011)====

After some initial issues with San Antonio over his contract, Ginóbili re-signed with the Spurs and started every game during the 2004–05 season. This was his best season yet as he was selected as a reserve by NBA coaches to the 2005 Western Conference All-Star team, marking his debut in the elite mid-season showcase. During the playoffs, Ginóbili&#x27;s play was pivotal to winning San Antonio&#x27;s third championship. The Spurs first defeated Phoenix 4–1 in the Conference Finals, before prevailing in a very defense-oriented seven-game series against the Detroit Pistons. Ginóbili recorded career-highs in his playoff numbers, most notably 20.8 ppg and 5.8 rpg, and had the third-highest point total in the entire playoffs. In the NBA Finals MVP Award voting, the shooting guard was a candidate but was edged out by teammate and captain Tim Duncan. The former finished the 2004–05 season as the second-leading scorer on the team. During the season, Ginóbili became only the fourth person to win consecutive &quot;Olimpias de Oro&quot;, this time sharing the award with soccer star Carlos Tevez.

The 2005–06 season was an injury-plagued one for Ginóbili, who suffered foot and ankle injuries that hindered his ability to play. Ginóbili managed 65 games in the regular season, but saw a dip in major statistics as compared to the previous season. During the playoffs, he returned to form, but was unable to prevent the Spurs from being eliminated by the Dallas Mavericks in the Conference Semifinals.

In the 2006–07 season, the Spurs lacked energy from their reserves. Ginóbili came off the bench for most of the second half of the season, helping the Spurs attain the league&#x27;s best record during that portion of the season. Ginóbili produced numbers closely identical to his successful 2004–05 campaign despite starting in only 36 of 75 games, his second-lowest number of starts since arriving at San Antonio. The 2007 NBA Playoffs saw him help the Spurs to defeat the Denver Nuggets, Phoenix Suns and Utah Jazz; the team then swept the Cleveland Cavaliers for Ginobili&#x27;s third and San Antonio&#x27;s fourth championship.

Ginóbili was to play an even bigger role for the Spurs the following season, reaching career high averages in points, rebounds, assists, and three-point field goal percentage. On 11 February 2008, he scored 34 points and recorded 15 rebounds in a 93–88 win over the Toronto Raptors, becoming the first guard in Spurs&#x27; history to have at least 15 points and 15 rebounds in a game. On 21 April 2008, the NBA announced that Ginóbili had won the 2008 Sixth Man Award, winning 123 out of the 124 first place votes. He had a statline of 19.5 points, 4.5 assists, and 4.8 rebounds on .460 shooting averaging 31.1 minutes. Only a couple of weeks later, the Argentine was also named to the All-NBA Third Team. In the playoffs, the Spurs defeated the Suns 4–1 in the first round, and Ginóbili was moved to the starting lineup in the second round against the New Orleans Hornets after the Spurs lost the first two road games. San Antonio eventually prevailed in seven games, the Argentine played another strong series, leading the Spurs in points and assists per game (21.3 and 6.0 respectively). However, San Antonio lost to arch-rivals Los Angeles Lakers in the Conference Finals in five games, and once again failed to capture back-to-back NBA championships.

The following season, Ginóbili was injured for most of the campaign, managing only 44 regular-season games and missing the 2009 NBA Playoffs entirely. San Antonio qualified for the playoffs as the third seed with a 54–28 record, but with an aging supporting cast (Bowen, Michael Finley and Kurt Thomas were all in their late 30s), the Spurs were only considered fringe contenders for the championship. As it turned out, the strong play of Duncan and Tony Parker were not enough to help the Spurs avoid a 4–1 defeat by Dallas, and the Spurs were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since 2000.

On 31 October 2009, in a game against the Sacramento Kings, a bat descended onto the court at the AT&amp;T Center, causing a stoppage of play. As the bat flew past, Ginóbili swatted the bat to the ground with his hand. He then carried the creature off the court, earning the applause of the crowd. On 9 April 2010, the Spurs and Ginóbili agreed to a three-year, $39 million contract extension through the 2012–13 season.

In 2010–11, Ginobili was regarded as the key player on his team, and he finished eighth on the NBA MVP ballot following the season. Ginobili was injured in the last game of the regular season. Despite the injury, he averaged 20.6 points and 4.2 assists during the team&#x27;s first-round series against Memphis Grizzlies; however, the Spurs lost the series in six games. Ginóbili was named an NBA All-Star for the second time in his career and also was named to the All-NBA third team.

====Later career (2011–2018)====

In the lockout-shortened 2011–12 season, Ginóbili helped the Spurs go 50–16. The team advanced to the Western Conference Finals, where they were defeated 4–2 by the Oklahoma City Thunder. In Game 5 of the series, Ginóbili scored 34 points.

In 2012–13, the Spurs advanced to the NBA Finals, where they faced the Miami Heat. In the Spurs&#x27; Game 5 victory, Ginóbili scored a season-high 24 points and helped his team take a 3–2 series lead. However, the Spurs went on to lose Games 6 and 7.

On 11 July 2013, Ginóbili re-signed with the Spurs on a two-year deal. In 2013–14, the Spurs had a league-best 62–20 record. Ginóbili finished third in the voting for Sixth Man of the Year. In Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals against the Thunder, the Big Three of Duncan, Parker, and Ginóbili notched their 110th career playoff win, matching the number of playoff wins attained by Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Michael Cooper of the Los Angeles Lakers. The Spurs reached the NBA Finals again, where they faced the Heat for the second consecutive year. This time, they dominated the series, winning 4–1 to claim that franchise&#x27;s fifth championship; Ginóbili won his fourth championship as a Spur.

On 20 July 2015, Ginóbili re-signed with the Spurs. On 14 January 2016, in a win over the Cleveland Cavaliers, he played his 900th NBA game, all with the Spurs. On 4 February, Ginóbili underwent surgery after suffering a testicular injury in the Spurs&#x27; win over the New Orleans Pelicans the previous night. He was subsequently sidelined for one month. He returned to the action on 5 March after missing 12 games with the injury, scoring 22 points in 15 minutes against the Sacramento Kings.

On 14 July 2016, Ginóbili re-signed with the Spurs. On 9 November, in a loss to the Houston Rockets, Ginóbili became the 15th second-rounder to reach 13,000 points and joined Rashard Lewis as the only second round draft picks in NBA history with 13,000 career points and at least 1,300 three-pointers.

In Game 5 of the 2017 Western Conference Semifinals against Houston, Ginóbili blocked James Harden&#x27;s shot in the closing seconds to help San Antonio to a 110–107 victory. In Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals against Golden State Warriors, Ginóbili became the first player at the age of 39 to score 20 or more points off the bench in a playoff game since the NBA began recording starts in the 1970–71 NBA season.

On 24 August 2017, Ginóbili re-signed with the Spurs. In January 2018, he became the only player in NBA history to have multiple 20-point games off the bench at age 40 or older. Ginóbili also became the first player in his 40s to score 15-plus points in back-to-back games since Michael Jordan in 2002–03. On 28 January against the Sacramento Kings, Ginóbili and Vince Carter scored 21 and 15 points respectively; it was the first game in NBA history where two players over the age of 40 scored 15 points or more. On 29 March, in a 103–99 victory over the Thunder, Ginobili became the Spurs&#x27; career leader in steals, passing David Robinson (1,388) for the franchise record. In Game 4 of the Spurs&#x27; first round playoff series against the Warriors, Ginóbili played in his 217th playoff game, breaking a tie with Shaquille O&#x27;Neal for sixth in league history. Ginóbili also passed Reggie Miller for third in career 3-pointers in playoff history. The Spurs lost to the Warriors in five games.

=== Retirement ===
On 27 August 2018, Ginóbili announced his retirement from professional basketball, making him the second player that season to complete a career with one team, after Nick Collison of the Oklahoma City Thunder. On 28 March 2019, the Spurs retired Ginóbili&#x27;s No. 20 jersey, right next to the No. 21 jersey of Tim Duncan.

==Post-playing career==
On 24 September 2021, the San Antonio Spurs announced that they had appointed Ginóbili as special advisor to basketball operations.

On 10 September 2022, Ginóbili became the 12th player to have played for the San Antonio Spurs franchise to be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. However, he is one of only four Spurs players to be inducted who played exclusively for San Antonio for their entire NBA career the others being fellow 2022 inductee George Karl, David Robinson and Tim Duncan. Former teammate Tim Duncan presented Ginóbili at the ceremony. Ginóbili joins fellow 2022 inductee George Karl as being one of only five players of the twelve elected to the Hall of Fame to play five or more seasons with the Spurs, the others being George Gervin, Tim Duncan, and David Robinson.

==National team career==
Ginóbili was a core member of a hugely successful Argentina national basketball team, which is sometimes referred to as the Golden Generation.

===Junior national team===
Ginóbili played with the junior Argentina national team at the 1997 FIBA Under-21 World Championship, where his team finished in 4th place.

===Senior national team===
Ginóbili was a member of the senior Argentina national basketball team, and made his senior debut during the 1998 FIBA World Championship in Athens. He also played at the 2002 FIBA World Championship, where he won a silver medal. Ginóbili&#x27;s best accomplishment as a member of the national team came at the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics when he led Argentina to a gold medal as they became the first team other than Team USA to emerge as the competition&#x27;s winner in 16 years. The highlight of the tournament was his game-winning buzzer beater with 0.7 seconds remaining, on the opening day of the Olympics, in a game versus Serbia and Montenegro. Ginóbili led the team in both scoring (19.3 points per game) and assists (3.3 assists per game).

Ginóbili played with Argentina at the 2006 FIBA World Championship, where his team finished in 4th place. Ginóbili was the flag bearer for Argentina at the opening ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics, which was held in Beijing, China. At the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics basketball tournament, Argentina defeated Lithuania to win the bronze medal game, although the shooting guard did not play in that match, after sustaining an injury in the tournament&#x27;s semifinals. In April 2010, Ginóbili announced that he would not participate in the 2010 FIBA World Championship, due to family reasons. However, he competed for the team at the 2012 London Summer Olympics, where Argentina narrowly missed out on winning the bronze medal, in the bronze medal game versus Russia. Ginóbili played his last international games at the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics, where Argentina finished in 8th place.

==Player profile==
Ginóbili was listed as 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) in shoes, weighed 205 lb (93 kg), and played left-handed. He established himself as a star shooting guard and became known as one of the greatest sixth men in NBA history. Ginóbili was a relatively late bloomer, entering the NBA at age 25 in a period when entering the NBA as a teenager was very common. He was known as a reliable and versatile backcourt player.

Apart from his up-tempo and aggressive style, Ginóbili was known for his clutch play. Ginóbili&#x27;s go-to move was either a three-pointer or a fierce drive to the basket. He often lowered his head when driving to the basket to collapse defenses and create shots or passes to his teammates. Ginobili popularized the Euro step in the NBA, although he was not the first to use the move in the league.

Ginobili was known as a team player. He accepted the Spurs coaches&#x27; decision to bring him off the bench for most of his career. He was also known for his difficult-to-defend passes, including the no-look pass. Ginobili was also willing to draw charges on defense. In 2007, he was listed by ESPN writer Thomas Neumann at No. 6 on the list of greatest floppers in NBA history. Five years later, Ian Thomsen, a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; columnist, grouped Ginóbili with fellow European league players Anderson Varejão and Vlade Divac as the players who &quot;made [flopping] famous&quot;, by exaggerating contact on the court in a manner analogous to diving in soccer games.
Having traversed the major basketball continents during his career, Ginóbili is one of the few players who enjoyed success under both the physical, one-on-one play of the NBA and the more technical, jump-shooting rule set of FIBA. He is one of only two players in basketball history (along with Bill Bradley) to win the EuroLeague, an Olympic gold medal, and an NBA championship ring. Ginóbili is also the first non-U.S. player to win both the NBA championship ring and the Olympic gold medal, and the second Latin American to be selected to play in an NBA All-Star game (after Panama&#x27;s Rolando Blackman). The Spurs made the NBA playoffs in each of his 16 NBA seasons.

In 2007, ESPN sportswriter John Hollinger ranked Ginóbili as the sixth-best international player then active in the NBA, describing Ginobili as &quot;one of the great draft heists of all time&quot; and attributing the trend of NBA teams drafting developing European players to the success of the Argentine. The following year, Ginóbili was named by ESPN as one of the best EuroLeague players to have graced the NBA.

<doc id="147042" wikidata="Q206008" url="?curid=147042" title="ISO 9000 family">
<text>The ISO 9000 family is a set of international standards for quality management systems. It was developed in March 1987 by International Organization for Standardization. The goal of these standards is to help organizations ensure that they meet customer and other stakeholder needs within the statutory and regulatory requirements related to a product or service. The standards were designed to fit into an integrated management system. The ISO refers to the set of standards as a &quot;family&quot;, bringing together the standard for quality management systems and a set of &quot;supporting standards&quot;, and their presentation as a family facilitates their integrated application within an organisation. ISO 9000 deals with the fundamentals and vocabulary of QMS, including the seven quality management principles that underlie the family of standards. ISO 9001 deals with the requirements that organizations wishing to meet the standard must fulfill. A companion document, ISO/TS 9002, provides guidelines for the application of ISO 9001. ISO 9004 gives guidance on achieving sustained organizational success.

Third-party certification bodies confirm that organizations meet the requirements of ISO 9001. Over one million organizations worldwide are independently certified, making ISO 9001 one of the most widely used management tools in the world today. However, the ISO certification process has been criticised as being wasteful and not being useful for all organizations.

==History==
In March 1979, BSI published the world&#x27;s first quality management systems standard, BS 5750, as part of a response to growing concerns about the quality. BS 5750 supplied the template for the development of the ISO 9000 series in March 1987, by ISO. However, its history can be traced back some twenty years before that, to the publication of government procurement standards, such as the United States Department of Defense MIL-Q-9858 standard in 1959, and the United Kingdom&#x27;s Def Stan 05–21 and 05–24. Large organizations that supplied government procurement agencies often had to comply with a variety of quality assurance requirements for each contract awarded, which led the defense industry to adopt mutual recognition of NATO AQAP, MIL-Q, and Def Stan standards. Eventually, industries adopted ISO 9000 instead of forcing contractors to adopt multiple—and often similar—requirements.

==Reasons for use==
The global adoption of ISO 9001 may be attributable to several factors. In the early days, the ISO 9001 (9002 and 9003) requirements were intended to be used by procuring organizations, such as contractors and design activities, as the basis of contractual arrangements with their suppliers. This helped reduce the need for subcontract supplier quality development by establishing basic requirements for a supplier to assure product quality. The ISO 9001 requirements could be tailored to meet specific contractual situations, depending on the complexity of the product, business type (design responsibility, manufacture only, distribution, servicing, etc.), and risk to the procurer. For example, the food industry combined the ISO 9000 series with HACCP as a single management system. If a chosen supplier was weak in the controls of their measurement equipment (calibration), and hence QC/inspection results, that specific requirement would be invoked in the contract. Adopting a single quality assurance requirement also leads to cost savings throughout the supply chain by reducing the administrative burden of maintaining multiple sets of quality manuals and procedures. 

A few years later, the UK Government took steps to improve national competitiveness following the publication of a white paper on Standards, Quality and International Competitiveness, Cmd 8621, and Third-Party Certification of Quality Management Systems was born under the auspices of the National Accreditation Council of Certification Bodies (NACCB), which has become the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS).

In addition to many stakeholders&#x27; benefits, several studies have identified significant financial benefits for organizations certified to ISO 9001, with an ISO analysis of 42 studies showing that implementing the standard enhances financial performance. Corbett &quot;et al.&quot; showed that certified organizations achieved a superior return on assets compared to otherwise similar organizations without certification.

Heras &quot;et al.&quot; found similarly superior performance and demonstrated that this was statistically significant and not a function of organization size. Naveha and Marcus claimed that implementing ISO 9001 led to superior operational performance in the U.S. automotive industry. Sharma identified similar improvements in operating performance and linked this to superior financial performance. Chow-Chua &quot;et al.&quot; showed better overall financial performance was achieved for companies in Denmark. Rajan and Tamimi (2003) showed that ISO 9001 certification resulted in superior stock market performance and suggested that shareholders were richly rewarded for the investment in an ISO 9001 system.

While the connection between superior financial performance and ISO 9001 may be seen from the examples cited, there remains no proof of direct causation, though longitudinal studies, such as those of Corbett &quot;et al.&quot; (2005), may suggest it. Other writers, such as Heras &quot;et al.&quot; (2002), have indicated that while there is some evidence of this, the improvement is partly driven by the fact that there is a tendency for better-performing companies to seek ISO 9001 certification.

The mechanism for improving results has also been the subject of much research. Lo &quot;et al.&quot; (2007) identified operational improvements (e.g., cycle time reduction, inventory reductions) as following from certification. Internal process improvements in organizations lead to externally observable improvements. The benefit of increased international trade and domestic market share, in addition to the internal benefits such as customer satisfaction, interdepartmental communications, work processes, and customer/supplier partnerships derived, far exceeds any and all initial investment.

==Global adoption==
The increase in ISO 9001 certification is shown in the tables below.


==ISO 9000 series Quality Management Principles==
The ISO 9000 series are based on seven quality management principles (QMP), namely:
====

ISO 9001:2015 Quality management systems — Requirements is a document of approximately 30 pages available from the national standards organization in each country. Only ISO 9001 is directly audited against for third-party assessment purposes.

Contents of ISO 9001:2015 are as follows:
* Section 1: Scope
* Section 2: Normative references
* Section 3: Terms and definitions
* Section 4: Context of the organization
* Section 5: Leadership
* Section 6: Planning
* Section 7: Support
* Section 8: Operation
* Section 9: Performance evaluation
* Section 10: Continual Improvement

Essentially, the layout of the standard is similar to the previous ISO 9001:2008 standard in that it follows the Plan, Do, Check, Act cycle in a process-based approach but is now further encouraging this to have risk-based thinking (section 0.3.3 of the introduction). The purpose of the quality objectives is to determine the conformity of the requirements (customers and organizations), facilitate effective deployment, and improve the quality management system.

Before the certification body can issue or renew a certificate, the auditor must be satisfied that the company being assessed has implemented the requirements of sections 4 to 10. Sections 1 to 3 are not directly audited against, but because they provide context and definitions for the rest of the standard, not that of the organization, their contents must be taken into account.

The standard no longer specifies that the organization shall issue and maintain documented procedures, but ISO 9001:2015 requires the organization to document any other procedures required for its effective operation. The standard also requires the organization to issue and communicate a documented quality policy, a quality management system scope, and quality objectives. The standard no longer requires compliant organizations to issue a formal Quality Manual. The standard does require the retention of numerous records, as specified throughout the standard. New for the 2015 release is a requirement for an organization to assess risks and opportunities (section 6.1) and to determine internal and external issues relevant to its purpose and strategic direction (section 4.1). The organization must demonstrate how the standard&#x27;s requirements are being met, while the external auditor&#x27;s role is to determine the quality management system&#x27;s effectiveness. More detailed interpretation and implementation examples are often sought by organizations seeking more information in what can be a very technical area.

==Certification==
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) does not certify organizations themselves. Numerous certification bodies exist that audit organizations and issue ISO 9001 compliance certificates upon success. Although commonly referred to as &quot;ISO 9000&quot; certification, the actual standard to which an organization&#x27;s quality management system can be certified is ISO 9001:2015 (ISO 9001:2008 expired around September 2018). Many countries have formed accreditation bodies to authorize (&quot;accredit&quot;) the certification bodies. Both the accreditation bodies and the certification bodies charge fees for their services. The various accreditation bodies have mutual agreements with each other to ensure that certificates issued by one of the accredited certification bodies (CB) are accepted worldwide. Certification bodies themselves operate under another quality standard, ISO/IEC 17021, while accreditation bodies operate under ISO/IEC 17011.

An organization applying for ISO 9001 certification is audited based on an extensive sample of its sites, functions, products, services, and processes. The auditor presents a list of problems (defined as &quot;nonconformities&quot;, &quot;observations&quot;, or &quot;opportunities for improvement&quot;) to management. If there are no major nonconformities, the certification body issues a certificate. Where major nonconformities are identified, the organization presents an improvement plan to the certification body (e.g., corrective action reports showing how the problems will be resolved); once the certification body is satisfied that the organization has carried out sufficient corrective action, it issues a certificate. The certificate is limited by a particular scope (e.g., production of golf balls) and displays the addresses to which the certificate refers.

An ISO 9001 certificate is not a once-and-for-all award but must be renewed, in accordance with the requirements of ISO 17021, at regular intervals recommended by the certification body, usually once every three years. There are no grades of competence within ISO 9001: either a company is certified (meaning that it is committed to the method and model of quality management described in the standard) or it is not. In this respect, ISO 9001 certification contrasts with measurement-based quality systems.

==Evolution of ISO 9000 standards==
The ISO 9000 standard is continually being revised by standing technical committees and advisory groups, who receive feedback from those professionals who are implementing the standard.

===1987 version===
ISO 9000:1987 had the same structure as the British Standard BS 5750, with three specifications for quality management systems, the selection of which was based on the scope of activities of the organization:
* ISO 9001:1987 &quot;Model for quality assurance in design, development, production, installation, and servicing&quot; was for companies and organizations whose activities included the creation of new products.
* ISO 9002:1987 &quot;Model for quality assurance in production, installation, and servicing&quot; had basically the same material as ISO 9001 but without covering the creation of new products.
* ISO 9003:1987 &quot;Model for quality assurance in final inspection and test&quot; covered only the final inspection of finished product, with no concern for how the product was produced.
&quot;ISO 9000:1987&quot; was also influenced by existing U.S. and other Defense Standards (&quot;MIL SPECS&quot;), and so was well-suited to manufacturing. The emphasis tended to be placed on conformance with procedures rather than the overall process of management, which was likely the actual intent.

===1994 version===
&quot;ISO 9000:1994&quot; emphasized quality assurance via preventive actions, instead of just checking final product, and continued to require evidence of compliance with documented procedures. As with the first edition, the down-side was that companies tended to implement its requirements by creating shelf-loads of procedure manuals, and becoming burdened with an ISO bureaucracy. In some companies, adapting and improving processes could actually be impeded by the quality management system.

===2000 version===

&quot;ISO 9001:2000&quot; replaced all three former standards of 1994 issues, &quot;ISO 9001&quot;, &quot;ISO 9002,&quot; and &quot;ISO 9003&quot;. Design and development procedures were required only if a company does, in fact, engage in the creation of new products. The 2000 version sought to make a radical change in thinking by actually placing front and center the concept of process management (the monitoring and optimization of a company&#x27;s tasks and activities, instead of just inspection of the final product). The 2000 version also demanded involvement by upper executives in order to integrate quality into the business system and avoid delegation of quality functions to junior administrators. Another goal was to improve effectiveness via process performance metrics: numerical measurement of the effectiveness of tasks and activities. Expectations of continual process improvement and tracking customer satisfaction were made explicit.

ISO 9000 Requirements include:
* Approve documents before distribution;
* Provide correct version of documents at points of use;
* Use your records to prove that requirements have been met; and
* Develop a procedure to control your records.

===2008 version===
ISO 9001:2008 in essence re-narrates ISO 9001:2000. The 2008 version only introduced clarifications to the existing requirements of ISO 9001:2000 and some changes intended to improve consistency with ISO 14001:2004. There were no new requirements. For example, in ISO 9001:2008, a quality management system being upgraded just needs to be checked to see if it is following the clarifications introduced in the amended version.

ISO 9001 is supplemented directly by two other standards of the family:
* ISO 9000:2005 &quot;Quality management systems. Fundamentals and vocabulary&quot;
* ISO 9004:2009 &quot;Managing for the sustained success of an organization. A quality management approach&quot;
Other standards, like ISO 19011 and the ISO 10000 series, may also be used for specific parts of the quality system.

===2015 version===
In 2012, ISO/TC 176 – responsible for ISO 9001 development – celebrated 25 years of implementing ISO 9001 and concluded that it was necessary to create a new QMS model for the next 25 years. They subsequently commenced the official work on creating a revision of ISO 9001, starting with the new QM principles. This moment was considered by important specialists in the field as the &quot;beginning of a new era in the development of quality management systems&quot;. As a result of the intensive work from this technical committee, the revised standard ISO 9001:2015 was published by ISO on 23 September 2015. The scope of the standard has not changed; however, the structure and core terms were modified to allow the standard to integrate more easily with other international management systems standards.

The new &quot;ISO 9001:2015&quot; management system standard helps ensure that consumers can secure reliable, desired quality goods and services. This further increases benefits for a business.

The 2015 version is also less prescriptive than its predecessors and focuses on performance. This was achieved by combining the process approach with &quot;risk-based thinking&quot;, and employing the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle at all levels in the organization.

Some of the key changes include:
* High-Level Structure of 10 clauses is implemented. Now all new management system standards released by ISO will have this high-level structure
* Greater emphasis on building a management system suited to each organization&#x27;s particular needs
* A requirement that those at the top of an organization be involved and accountable, aligning quality with wider business strategy
* Risk-based thinking throughout the standard makes the whole management system function as a preventive tool and encourages continuous improvement
* Less prescriptive requirements for documentation: the organization can now decide, in addition to the mandatory documents and records, what documented information it needs and in what format it should be
* Alignment with other key management system standards through the use of a common structure and core text
* Inclusion of knowledge management principles
* Quality Manuals and management representatives (MR) are no longer mandatory.

&quot;Risk-based thinking&quot; is seen as a development from a traditional approach to risk management, seen as the responsibility of a &quot;risk manager&quot;, to an approach which sees risk management as &quot;a fundamental way of thinking and decision making throughout [an] entire organization. The ISO and the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) have issued joint guidance on auditing practices covering risk-based thinking.

==Auditing==
Two types of auditing are required to become registered to the standard: auditing by an external certification body (external audit) and audits by internal staff trained for this process (internal audits). The aim is a continual review and assessment process to verify that the system is working as it is supposed to, find out where it can improve, and correct or prevent identified problems. It is considered healthier for internal auditors to audit outside their usual management line to bring a degree of independence to their judgements. Supporting papers are provided by the ISO 9001 Auditing Practices Group. This is constituted as an informal group of quality management system (QMS) experts, auditors, and practitioners, drawn from the ISO Technical Committee 176 Quality Management and Quality Assurance (ISO/TC 176) and the International Accreditation Forum (IAF).

==Industry-specific interpretations==
The ISO 9001 standard is generic; its parts must be carefully interpreted to make sense within a particular organization. Developing software is not like making cheese or offering counseling services, yet the ISO 9001 guidelines, because they are business management guidelines, can be applied to each of these. That being said there is no requirement to cite scientific or industrial guidelines/textbooks/journals. Diverse organizations—police departments (United States), professional soccer teams (Mexico), and city councils (UK)—have successfully implemented ISO 9001 systems.

Over time, various industry sectors have wanted to standardize their interpretations of the guidelines within their own marketplace. This is partly to ensure that their versions of ISO 9000 have their specific requirements, but also to try and ensure that more appropriately trained and experienced auditors are sent to assess them and even certify according to that interpretation.
* The TickIT guidelines are an interpretation of ISO 9000 produced by the UK Board of Trade to suit the processes of the information technology industry, especially software development.
* AS9000 is the Aerospace Basic Quality System Standard, an interpretation developed by major aerospace manufacturers. Those major manufacturers include AlliedSignal, Allison Engine, Boeing, General Electric Aircraft Engines, Lockheed-Martin, McDonnell Douglas, Northrop Grumman, Pratt &amp; Whitney, Rockwell-Collins, Sikorsky Aircraft, and Sundstrand. The current version is AS9100D.
* PS 9000 * QS 9000 is an interpretation agreed upon by major automotive manufacturers (GM, Ford, Chrysler). It includes techniques such as FMEA and APQP. QS 9000 is now replaced by ISO/TS 16949.
* ISO/TS 16949:2009 is an interpretation agreed upon by major automotive manufacturers (American and European manufacturers); the latest version is based on ISO 9001:2008. The emphasis on a process approach is stronger than in ISO 9001:2008. ISO/TS 16949:2009 contains the full text of ISO 9001:2008 and automotive industry-specific requirements. After the new edition of ISO 9001:2015 the ISO/TS 16949:2009 was also completely revised and reissued by IATF (International Automotive Task Force). IATF 16949:2016 is now a stand-alone standard that doesn&#x27;t include the ISO 9001:2015 requirements but still refers to them and works as an additional automotive-specific requirement to ISO 9001.
* TL 9000 is the Telecom Quality Management and Measurement System Standard, an interpretation developed by the telecom consortium, QuEST Forum. In 1998 QuEST Forum developed the TL 9000 Quality Management System to meet the supply chain quality requirements of the worldwide telecommunications industry. The TL 9000 standard is made up of two handbooks: the QMS Requirements Handbook, and the QMS Measurement Handbook. The current versions of the Requirements and Measurements Handbooks are 6.0. Unlike ISO 9001 or other sector-specific standards, TL 9000 includes standardized product and process measurements that must be reported into a central repository, which allows organizations to benchmark their performance in key process areas against peer organizations. TL 9000 R6.0 contains the full text of ISO 9001:2015.
* ISO 13485:2016 is the medical industry&#x27;s equivalent of ISO 9001. ISO 13485:2016 is a stand-alone standard. Because ISO 13485 is relevant to medical device manufacturers (unlike ISO 9001, which is applicable to any industry), and because of the differences between the two standards relating to continual improvement, compliance with ISO 13485 does not necessarily mean compliance with ISO 9001 (and vice versa).
* ISO/IEC 90003:2014 provides guidelines for the application of ISO 9001 to computer software.
* ISO/TS 29001 is quality management system requirements for the design, development, production, installation, and service of products for the petroleum, petrochemical, and natural gas industries. It is equivalent to API Spec Q1 without the Monogram annex.
*ISO 18091 is the guidelines for the application of ISO 9001 in local government.
*ISO/TS 54001 is the Quality management system with particular requirements for the application of ISO 9001:2015 for electoral organizations at all levels of government.
*ISO 17025:2017 is the Quality Management System applicable only to Testing and Calibration Laboratories.

==Effectiveness==
The debate on the effectiveness of ISO 9000 commonly centers on the following questions:
# Are the quality principles in ISO 9001 of value?
# Does it help to implement an ISO 9001-compliant quality management system?
# Does it help to obtain ISO 9001 certification?

The effectiveness of the ISO system being implemented depends on a number of factors, the most significant of which are:
# Commitment of senior management to monitor, control, and improve quality. Senior managers must be strongly involved in the quality management activities, starting with the definition of a quality strategy for the organisation. 
# Motivations to adopt the standard. Internal motivations such as a genuine desire to improve the product quality, company processes, and process efficiency tend to facilitate the implementation of the standard and to increase the effectiveness of the certification. Organizations that implement an ISO system without this desire often take the cheapest road to get a certificate on the wall and ignore problem areas uncovered in the audits. External motivations (such as stakeholder pressure or customer demand) tend to produce lower certification benefits.
# Making a convenient analysis of the internal context of the company that wants to adopt the standard, preparing for the implementation of the standard (e.g. training), planning for the implementation of the standard in the organisation, and the organisational (personnel, culture) receptivity to the implementation of the standard. 
# The degree of effective implementation of the standard (i.e., internalization of the standard in the processes of the organization). That is, how well the ISO system integrates into current business practices. Many organizations that implement ISO try to make their system fit into a cookie-cutter quality manual instead of creating a manual that documents existing practices and only adds new processes to meet the ISO standard when necessary.
# How well the ISO system focuses on improving the customer experience. The broadest definition of quality is &quot;Whatever the customer perceives good quality to be.&quot; This means that a company doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to make a product that never fails; some customers have a higher tolerance for product failures if they always receive shipments on-time or have a positive experience in some other dimension of customer service. An ISO system should take into account all areas of the customer experience and the industry expectations, and seek to improve them on a continual basis. This means taking into account all processes that deal with the three stakeholders (customers, suppliers, and organization). Only then can a company sustain improvements in the customer&#x27;s experience.
# How well the auditor finds and communicates areas of improvement. While ISO auditors may not provide consulting to the clients they audit, there is the potential for auditors to point out areas of improvement. Many auditors simply rely on submitting reports that indicate compliance or non-compliance with the appropriate section of the standard; however, to most executives, this is like speaking a foreign language. Auditors that can clearly identify and communicate areas for improvement in language and terms executive management understands facilitate action on improvement initiatives by the companies they audit. When management doesn&#x27;t understand why they were non-compliant and the business implications associated with non-compliance, they simply ignore the reports and focus on what they do understand.

===Advantages===
Proper quality management can improve business, often having a positive effect on investment, market share, sales growth, sales margins, competitive advantage, and avoidance of litigation. The quality principles in ISO 9000:2000 are also sound, according to Wade and Barnes, who says that &quot;ISO 9000 guidelines provide a comprehensive model for quality management systems that can make any company competitive&quot;. Sroufe and Curkovic, (2008) found benefits ranging from registration required to remain part of a supply base, better documentation, to cost benefits, and improved involvement and communication with management. According to the ISO, the 2015 version of the standard brings the following benefits:
# By assessing their context, organizations can define who is affected by their work and what they expect. This enables clearly stated business objectives and the identification of new business opportunities.
# Organizations can identify and address the risks associated with their organization.
# By putting customers first, organizations can make sure they consistently meet customer needs and enhance customer satisfaction. This can lead to more repeat customers, new clients and increased business for the organization.
# Organizations work in a more efficient way as all their processes are aligned and understood by everyone. This increases productivity and efficiency, bringing internal costs down.
# Organizations will meet necessary statutory and regulatory requirements.
# Organizations can expand into new markets, as some sectors and clients require ISO 9001 before doing business.

===Criticisms of ISO 9001 certification===
A common criticism of ISO 9000 and 9001 is the amount of money, time, and paperwork required for a complete implementation, and later, when needed, ISO 9001 certification. Dalgleish cites the &quot;inordinate and often unnecessary paperwork burden&quot; of ISO, and says that &quot;quality managers feel that ISO&#x27;s overhead and paperwork are excessive and extremely inefficient&quot;. The level of minimum documentation for a minimum scope organization has been greatly reduced, going from ISO 9001:2000 to ISO 9001:2008 to ISO 9001:2015.

According to Barnes: 

Wilson suggests that ISO standards &quot;elevate inspection of the correct procedures over broader aspects of quality&quot;, and therefore, &quot;the workplace becomes oppressive and quality is not improved&quot;.

One study showing reasons for not adopting this standard include the risks and uncertainty of not knowing if there are direct relationships to improved quality, and what kind and how many resources will be needed. Additional risks include how much certification will cost, increased bureaucratic processes and risk of poor company image if the certification process fails. According to John Seddon, ISO 9001 promotes specification, control, and procedures rather than understanding and improvement.

Wade argues that ISO 9000 is effective as a guideline, but that promoting it as a standard &quot;helps to mislead companies into thinking that certification means better quality, ... [undermining] the need for an organization to set its own quality standards&quot;. In short, Wade argues that reliance on the specifications of ISO 9001 does not guarantee a successful quality system.

The standard is seen as especially prone to failure when a company is interested in certification before quality. Certifications are in fact often based on customer contractual requirements rather than a desire to actually improve quality. ISO&#x27;s Roger Frost suggested: 

Certification by an independent auditor is often seen as the problem area, and according to Barnes, &quot;has become a vehicle to increase consulting services&quot;.

Dalgleish argues: &quot;...[while] quality has a positive effect on return on investment, market share, sales growth, better sales margins, and competitive advantage...taking a quality approach is unrelated to ISO 9000 registration.&quot; In fact, ISO itself advises that ISO 9001 can be implemented without certification, simply for the quality benefits that can be achieved.

Abrahamson argues that fashionable management discourse such as Quality Circles tends to follow a lifecycle in the form of a bell curve, possibly indicating a management fad.

Dytz argues that ISO 9001 certification is based on 7 management principles and that companies are free to develop their internal tools and working methods, however, the model adopted to audit and certify companies does not evaluate the effectiveness of these methods. Even when there is still a superficial analysis of this effectiveness, mainly due to the time available to audit these companies, the certifications do not distinguish two companies with the same business model, with regard to their internal capacity and quality of management.

Pickrell argues that ISO systems merely gauge whether the processes are being followed. It does not gauge how good the processes are or whether the correct parameters are being measured and controlled to ensure quality. Furthermore, when unique technical solutions are involved in the creation of a new part, ISO does not validate the robustness of the technical solution—a key part of advanced quality planning. It is not unheard of for an ISO-certified plant to display poor quality performance due to poor process selection and/or poor technical solutions.

Lastly, the standard itself is proprietary, and not open to inspection by the general public.

=== Reasons for Loss of ISO 9000 Certification ===
ISO 9001 certification has a three-year validity period. At the end of this period, every certified organization must renew its certificate. Not all organizations are successful in their renewal. Some organizations are not able to renew the certificate, because they do not conform to all requirements, and others simply decide not to renew the certificate. There are several reasons why an organization may lose or decide not to renew its ISO 9000 certification:

* Some companies may think that the total cost outweighs the certification benefits. This is the most cited reason for voluntary decertification, but some research suggests that economic underperformance is not the reason why firms lose the certification.
* In some industries, there may be too many competitors already certified which may create the sensation that the potential for competitive advantage gained from (re)certification is lower.
* Some companies may believe that they have internalized the certification benefits into their processes and do not feel the need for formal certification as they can continue to conform to the ISO 9001 standard without formal registration within a certification body.
* Some of the customers may no longer demand certification.
* Some companies may have considered their ISO 9001 certification as a first step into quality management and now want to evolve their quality management systems by advancing to other alternative certifications (e.g., IATF 16949:2016, in the automobile industry) or towards other more demanding quality management systems (e.g., TQM, six sigma, lean).
* Financial distress.
*Expected performance after decertification.
*Improper ISO 9001 implementation.
* and other reasons.

=== Propensity for Loss of ISO 9000 Certification ===
According to the latest data made available by ISO, approximately 60,000 organizations lose the certification every year. Given that there are approximately 1,000,000 certified organizations worldwide, and that 1/3 of these (approx. 333,333) must renew the certificate every year, the yearly average propensity for ISO 9001 withdrawal can be estimated roughly at 18% (60,000/333,333). The propensity of a given organization to lose its certification can be estimated, depending on several factors specific to the organization:

* initial certification motivations;
* certification barriers that were overcome during certification;
* certification benefits achieved;
* decertification motivations held;
* expected performance after decertification;
*and other factors.

<doc id="147049" wikidata="Q1322065" url="?curid=147049" title="ISO 14000 family">
<text>The ISO 14000 family is a set of international standards for environment management systems. It was developed in March 1996 by International Organization for Standardization. The goal of these standards is to help organizations (a) minimize how their operations (processes, etc.) negatively affect the environment (i.e. cause adverse changes to air, water, or land); (b) comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other environmentally oriented requirements; and (c) continually improve in the above. The standards were designed to fit into an integrated management system. 

ISO 14000 is similar to ISO 9000 quality management in that both pertain to the process of how a service/product is rendered, rather than to the service/product itself. As with ISO 9001, certification is performed by third-party organizations rather than being awarded by ISO directly. The ISO 19011 and ISO 17021 audit standards apply when audits are being performed. The current version of ISO 14001 is ISO 14001:2015, which was published in September 2015.

The requirements of ISO 14001 are an integral part of the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS). EMAS&#x27;s structure and material are more demanding, mainly concerning performance improvement, legal compliance, and reporting duties.

== History ==
In March 1992, BSI published the world&#x27;s first environmental management systems standard, BS 7750, as part of a response to growing concerns about the environment. BS 7750 supplied the template for the development of the ISO 14000 series in March 1996, by ISO. , more than 300,000 certifications to ISO 14001 can be found in 171 countries.

Prior to the development of the ISO 14000 series, organizations voluntarily constructed their own EMSs, but this made comparisons of environmental effects between companies difficult; therefore, the universal ISO 14000 series was developed. An EMS is defined by ISO as: &quot;part of the overall management system, that includes organizational structure, planning activities, responsibilities, practices, procedures, processes, and resources for developing, implementing, achieving, and maintaining the environmental policy.&quot;

== Development of the ISO 14000 series ==
The ISO 14000 family includes most notably the ISO 14001 standard, which represents the core set of standards used by organizations for designing and implementing an effective environmental management system (EMS). Other standards in this series include ISO 14004, which gives additional guidelines for a good EMS, and more specialized standards dealing with specific aspects of environmental management. The major objective of the ISO 14000 series of norms is to provide &quot;practical tools for companies and organizations of all kinds looking to manage their environmental responsibilities.&quot;

The ISO 14000 series is based on a voluntary approach to environmental regulation. The series includes the ISO 14001 standard, which provides guidelines for the establishment or improvement of an EMS. The standard shares many common traits with its predecessor, ISO 9000, the international standard of quality management, which served as a model for its internal structure, and both can be implemented side by side. As with ISO 9000, ISO 14000 acts both as an internal management tool and as a way of demonstrating a company&#x27;s environmental commitment to its customers and clients.

==ISO 14001 standard==
ISO 14001 defines criteria for an EMS. It does not state requirements for environmental performance but maps out a framework that a company or organization can follow to set up an effective EMS. It can be used by any organization that wants to improve resource efficiency, reduce waste, and reduce costs. Using ISO 14001 can provide assurance to company management and employees as well as external stakeholders that environmental impact is being measured and improved. ISO 14001 can also be integrated with other management functions and assists companies in meeting their environmental and economic goals.

ISO 14001, like other ISO 14000 standards, is voluntary, with its main aim to assist companies in continually improving their environmental performance and complying with any applicable legislation. The organization sets its own targets and performance measures, and the standard highlights what an organization needs to do to meet those goals, and to monitor and measure the situation. The standard does not focus on measures and goals of environmental performance, but of the organization. The standard can be applied to a variety of levels in the business, from the organizational level down to the product and service level. 

ISO 14001 is known as a generic management system standard, meaning that it is relevant to any organization seeking to improve and manage resources more effectively. This includes:

* single-site to large multi-national companies
* high-risk companies to low-risk service organizations
* the manufacturing, process, and service industries, including local governments
* all industry sectors, including public and private sectors
* original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers

=== ISO 14001:2015 ===

All standards are periodically reviewed by ISO to ensure they still meet market requirements. The current version is ISO 14001:2015, and certified organizations were given a three-year transition period to adapt their environmental management system to the new edition of the standard. The new version of ISO 14001 focuses on the improvement of environmental performance rather than the improvement of the management system itself. It also includes several new updates all aimed at making environmental management more comprehensive and relevant to the supply chain. One of the main updates asks organizations to consider environmental impact during the entire life cycle, although there is no requirement to actually complete a life cycle analysis. Additionally, the commitments of top management and the methods of evaluating compliance have also been strengthened. Another significant change linked ISO 14001 to the general management system structure, introduced in 2015, called the High Level Structure. Both ISO 9001 and 14001 use this same structure, making implementation and auditing more uniform. The new standard also requires the holder of the certificate to specify risks and opportunities and how to address them.

=== Basic principles and methodology ===

The basic principles of ISO 14001 are based on the well-known Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle.

==== Plan: Establish objectives and processes required ====
Prior to implementing ISO 14001, an initial review or gap analysis of the organization&#x27;s processes and products is recommended, to assist in identifying all elements of the current operation, and if possible, future operations, that may interact with the environment, termed &quot;environmental aspects&quot;. Environmental aspects can include both direct, such as those used during manufacturing, and indirect, such as raw materials. This review assists the organization in establishing their environmental objectives, goals, and targets (which should ideally be measurable); helps with the development of control and management procedures and processes; and serves to highlight any relevant legal requirement, which can then be built into the policy.

==== Do: Implement the processes ====
During this stage, the organization identifies the resources required and works out those members of the organization responsible for the EMS&#x27; implementation and control. This includes establishing procedures and processes, although only one documented procedure is specifically related to operational control. Other procedures are required to foster better management control over elements such as documentation control, emergency preparedness and response, and the education of employees, to ensure that they can competently implement the necessary processes and record results. Communication and participation across all levels of the organization, especially top management, is a vital part of the implementation phase, with the effectiveness of the EMS being dependent on active involvement from all employees.

==== Check: Measure and monitor the processes and report results ====
During the &quot;check&quot; stage, performance is monitored and periodically measured to ensure that the organization&#x27;s environmental targets and objectives are being met. In addition, internal audits are conducted at planned intervals to ascertain whether the EMS meets the user&#x27;s expectations and whether the processes and procedures are being adequately maintained and monitored.

==== Act: Take action to improve performance of EMS based on results ====
After the checking stage, a management review is conducted to ensure that the objectives of the EMS are being met, the extent to which they are being met, and that communications are being appropriately managed. The set targets are evaluated and if they are not being achieved then they are reevaluated. Additionally, the review evaluates changing circumstances, such as legal requirements, in order to make recommendations for further improvement of the system. These recommendations are incorporated through continual improvement: plans are renewed or new plans are made, and the EMS moves forward.

==== Continual Improvement Process (CI) ====
ISO 14001 encourages a company to continually improve its environmental performance. Apart from the obvious – the reduction in actual and possible negative environmental impacts – this is achieved in three ways:

* Expansion: Business areas increasingly get covered by the implemented EMS.
* Enrichment: Activities, products, processes, emissions, resources, etc. increasingly get managed by the implemented EMS.
* Upgrading: The structural and organizational framework of the EMS, as well as an accumulation of knowledge in dealing with business-environmental issues, is improved.

Overall, the CI concept expects the organization to gradually move away from merely operational environmental measures towards a more strategic approach on how to deal with environmental challenges.

=== Benefits ===
ISO 14001 was developed primarily to assist companies with a framework for better management control, which can result in reducing their environmental impact. In addition to improvements in performance, organizations can reap a number of economic benefits, including higher conformance with legislative and regulatory requirements by adopting the ISO standard. By minimizing the risk of regulatory and environmental liability fines and improving an organization&#x27;s efficiency, benefits can include a reduction in waste, consumption of resources, and operating costs. Secondly, as an internationally recognized standard, businesses operating in multiple locations across the globe can leverage their conformance to ISO 14001, eliminating the need for multiple registrations or certifications. Thirdly, there has been a push in the last decade by consumers for companies to adopt better internal controls, making the incorporation of ISO 14001 a smart approach for the long-term viability of businesses. This can provide them with a competitive advantage against companies that do not adopt the standard (Potoki &amp; Prakash, 2005). This in turn can have a positive impact on a company&#x27;s asset value (Van der Deldt, 1997). It can lead to improved public perceptions of the business, placing them in a better position to operate in the international marketplace. The use of ISO 14001 can demonstrate an innovative and forward-thinking approach to customers and prospective employees. It can increase a business&#x27;s access to new customers and business partners. In some markets it can potentially reduce public liability insurance costs. It can also serve to reduce trade barriers between registered businesses. There is growing interest in including certification to ISO 14001 in tenders for public-private partnerships for infrastructure renewal. Evidence of value in terms of environmental quality and benefit to the taxpayer has been shown in highway projects in Canada.

=== Conformity assessment===
ISO 14001 can be used in whole or in part to help an organization (for-profit or nonprofit) better manage its relationship with the environment. If all the elements of ISO 14001 are incorporated into the management process, the organization may opt to prove that it has achieved full alignment or conformity with the international standard, ISO 14001, by using one of four recognized options. These are:

#make a self-determination and self-declaration, or
#seek confirmation of its conformance by parties having an interest in the organization, such as customers, or
#seek confirmation of its self-declaration by a party external to the organization, or
#seek certification/registration of its EMS by an external organization.

ISO does not control conformity assessment; its mandate is to develop and maintain standards. ISO has a neutral policy on conformity assessment in so much that one option is not better than the next. Each option serves different market needs. The adopting organization decides which option is best for them, in conjunction with their market needs.

Option one is sometimes incorrectly referred to as &quot;self-certify&quot; or &quot;self-certification&quot;. This is not an acceptable reference under ISO terms and definitions, as it can lead to confusion in the market. The user is responsible for making their own determination. 

Option two is often referred to as a customer or 2nd-party audit, which is an acceptable market term. 

Option three is an independent third-party process by an organization that is based on an engagement activity and delivered by specially trained practitioners. This option was based on an accounting procedure branded as the EnviroReady Report, which was created to help small- and medium-sized organizations. Its development was originally based on the Canadian Handbook for Accountants; it is now based on an international accounting standard.

The fourth option, certification, is another independent third-party process, which has been widely implemented by all types of organizations. Certification is also known in some countries as registration. Service providers of certification or registration are accredited by International Accreditation Forum or national accreditation services such as UKAS in the UK.

===ISO 14001 and EMAS===
In 2010, the latest EMAS Regulation (EMAS III) entered into force; the scheme is now globally applicable, and includes key performance indicators and a range of further improvements. 
, more than 3,900 organizations and approximately 9,200 sites are EMAS registered.

====Complementarities and differences ====
ISO 14001&#x27;s EMS requirements are similar to those of EMAS. Additional requirements for EMAS include: 
* stricter requirements on the measurement and evaluation of environmental performance against objectives and targets
* government supervision of the environmental verifiers 
* strong employee involvement; EMAS organizations acknowledge that active employee involvement is a driving force and a prerequisite for continuous and successful environmental improvements.
* environmental core indicators creating multi-annual comparability within and between organizations 
* mandatory provision of information to the general public 
* registration by a public authority

====ISO 14001 use in supply chains====
There are many reasons that ISO 14001 should be potentially attractive to supply chain managers, including the use of the voluntary standard to guide the development of integrated systems, its requirement for supply chain members in industries such as automotive and aerospace, the potential of pollution prevention leading to reduced costs of production and higher profits, its alignment with the growing importance of corporate social responsibility, and the possibility that an ISO-registered system may provide firms with a unique environmental resource, capabilities, and benefits that lead to competitive advantage.
Research on the supply chain impact of ISO 14001 registration posited that potential positive impacts might include more proactive environmental management, higher levels of communication, higher levels of waste reduction and cost efficiency, better ROI, higher levels of customer relationship management, fewer issues with employee health, and a reduced number of safety incidents. This research concluded that ISO 14001 registration can be leveraged across the supply chain for competitive advantage.

<doc id="147052" wikidata="Q859365" url="?curid=147052" title="Big stick ideology">
<text>Big stick ideology, big stick diplomacy, big stick philosophy, or big stick policy was a political approach used by the 26th president of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt. The terms are derived from an aphorism which Roosevelt often said: &quot;speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far&quot;. The American press during his time, as well as many modern historians today, used the term &quot;big stick&quot; to describe the foreign policy positions during his administration. Roosevelt described his style of foreign policy as &quot;the exercise of intelligent forethought and of decisive action sufficiently far in advance of any likely crisis&quot;. As practiced by Roosevelt, big stick diplomacy had five components. First, it was essential to possess serious military capability that would force the adversary to pay close attention. At the time that meant a world-class navy; Roosevelt never had a large army at his disposal until the 1900s. The other qualities were to act justly toward other nations, never to bluff, to strike only when prepared to strike hard, and to be willing to allow the adversary to save face in defeat. 

The idea is negotiating peacefully but also having strength in case things go wrong. Simultaneously threatening with the &quot;big stick&quot;, or the military, ties in heavily with the idea of Realpolitik, which implies a pursuit of political power that resembles Machiavellian ideals. It is comparable to gunboat diplomacy, as used in international politics by the powers.

== Background ==

The term derives from the phrase, &quot;Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far,&quot; which Roosevelt claimed was a West African proverb, although there is little evidence for that.
Roosevelt (then Governor of New York), in a bout of happiness after forcing New York&#x27;s Republican committee to pull support away from a corrupt financial adviser, wrote to Henry L. Sprague a letter dated January 26, 1900, in which he said: 

He first publicly uttered the phrase in March of the same year in relation to his reputation for holding state Senators accountable. Roosevelt added clarification to the meaning of the saying.

Roosevelt would go on to be elected Vice President later that year and subsequently used the aphorism in an address to the Minnesota State Fair entitled &quot;National Duties&quot; on September 2, 1901:

== Usage ==
Although it had been used before his presidency, Roosevelt used military muscle several times throughout his two terms with a more subtle touch to complement his diplomatic policies and enforcing the Monroe Doctrine throughout multiple interventions in Latin America. This included the Great White Fleet, 16 battleships which peacefully circumnavigated the globe as an illustration of United States&#x27;s rising yet neutral prestige under Roosevelt&#x27;s direction.

=== Latin America ===
==== Venezuelan Affair (1902) and the Roosevelt Corollary ====
In the early 20th century, Venezuela was receiving complaints from Britain and Germany about &quot;acts of violence against the liberty of British subjects and the massive capture of British vessels&quot; who were from the UK and the lack of Venezuelan initiative to pay off long-standing debts. After the Royal Navy and Imperial German Navy took naval action with a blockade on Venezuela (1902–1903), Roosevelt denounced the blockade. The blockade provided the initial basis of the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine.

In 1904, although he had mentioned the basis of his idea beforehand in private letters, Roosevelt officially announced the corollary, stating that he only wanted the &quot;other republics on this continent&quot; to be &quot;happy and prosperous&quot;. For that goal to be met, the corollary required that they &quot;maintain order within their borders and behave with a just obligation toward outsiders&quot;.

Most historians, such as one of Roosevelt&#x27;s many biographers Howard K. Beale, have summarized that the corollary was influenced by Roosevelt&#x27;s personal beliefs as well as his connections to foreign bondholders. The U.S. public was very &quot;tense&quot; during the two-month blockade; Roosevelt asked Britain and Germany to pull out their forces from the area. During the requests for the blockade&#x27;s end, Roosevelt stationed naval forces in Cuba, to ensure &quot;the respect of Monroe doctrine&quot; and the compliance of the parties in question. The doctrine was never ratified by the senate or brought up for a vote to the American public. Roosevelt&#x27;s declaration was the first of many presidential decrees in the 20th century that were never ratified.

==== Canal diplomacy ====
The U.S. used the &quot;big stick&quot; during &quot;Canal Diplomacy&quot;, the diplomatic actions of the U.S. during the pursuit of a canal across Central America. Both Nicaragua and Panama featured canal related incidents of big stick diplomacy.

===== Proposed construction of the Nicaragua Canal =====
In 1901, Secretary of State John Hay pressed the Nicaraguan Government for approval of a canal. Nicaragua would receive $1.5 million in ratification, $100,000 annually, and the U.S. would &quot;provide sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity&quot;. Nicaragua then returned the contract draft with a change; they wished to receive, instead of an annual $100,000, $6 million in ratification. The U.S. accepted the deal, but, after Congress approved the contract, a problem of court jurisdiction came up. The U.S. did not have legal jurisdiction in the land of the future canal. This problem was on the verge of correction until pro-Panama representatives posed problems for Nicaragua; the current leader (General José Santos Zelaya) did not cause problems, from the outlook of U.S. interests.

===== Construction of the Panama Canal =====

In 1899, the Isthmian Canal Commission was set up to determine which site would be best for the canal (Nicaragua or Panama) and then to oversee construction of the canal. After Nicaragua was ruled out, Panama was the obvious choice. A few problems had arisen, however. With the U.S.&#x27;s solidified interests in Panama (then a small portion of Colombia), both Colombia and the French company that was to provide the construction materials raised their prices. The U.S., refusing to pay the higher-than-expected fees, &quot;engineered a revolution&quot; in Colombia. On November 3, 1903, Panama (with the support of the United States Navy) revolted against Colombia. Panama became a new republic, receiving $10 million from the U.S. alone. Panama also gained an annual payment of $250,000 and guarantees of independence. The U.S. gained the rights to the canal strip &quot;in perpetuity&quot;. Roosevelt later said that he &quot;took the Canal, and let Congress debate&quot;. After Colombia lost Panama, they tried to appeal to the U.S. by the reconsidering of treaties and even naming Panama City the capital of Colombia.

==== Cuba ====

The U.S. after the Spanish–American War had many expansionists who wanted to annex Cuba. Many people felt that a foreign power (outside of the U.S.) would control a portion of Cuba, thus the U.S. could not continue with its interests in Cuba. Although many advocated annexation, this was prevented by the Teller Amendment, which states &quot;hereby disclaims any disposition of intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over said island except for pacification thereof, and asserts its determination, when that is accomplished, to leave the government and control of the island to its people&quot;. When summarized, this could mean that the U.S. would not interfere with Cuba and its peoples. The expansionists argued that the Teller Amendment was created &quot;ignorant of actual conditions&quot;, which released the U.S. from its obligation. Following the debate surrounding the Teller Amendment, the Platt Amendment took effect. The Platt Amendment (the name is a misnomer; the Platt Amendment is actually a rider to the Army Appropriation Act of 1901) was accepted by Cuba in late 1901, after &quot;strong pressure&quot; from Washington. The Platt Amendment, summarized by Thomas A. Bailey in &quot;Diplomatic History of the American People&quot;:

# Cuba was not to make decisions impairing her independence or to permit a foreign power [e.g., Germany] to secure lodgment in control over the island.
# Cuba pledged herself not to incur an indebtedness beyond her means [It might result in foreign intervention].
# The United States was at liberty to intervene for the purpose of preserving order and maintaining Cuban independence.
# Cuba would agree to an American-sponsored sanitation program [Aimed largely at yellow fever].
# Cuba would agree to sell or lease to the United States sites for naval or coaling stations [Guantánamo became the principal base].

With the Platt Amendment in place, Roosevelt pulled the troops out of Cuba. A year later, Roosevelt wrote:

<doc id="147054" wikidata="Q7928568" url="?curid=147054" title="Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation">
<text>The Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation (VVAF), established in 1980, now the Veterans for America (VFA), is a Washington, D.C.-based international humanitarian organization that addresses the consequences of war and conflict. The founder of VVAF is Bobby Muller, a former U.S. Marine lieutenant and Vietnam veteran.

==Background==
In 1980, co-founders Bobby Muller and John Terzano created Vietnam Veteran of America Foundation with the goal of transforming the American experience of the Vietnam War into a mission of compassion and justice. VVAF&#x27;s first major initiative was a journey back to Vietnam in 1981 to make peace with the country. In 1991, after a trip to the Killing Fields of Cambodia, VVAF co-founded the International Campaign to Ban Landmines to ban landmines, called &quot;Campaign for A Landmine Free World&quot;, which was awarded the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize for its efforts to persuade countries to sign a treaty eradicating the use of antipersonnel landmines. In 1992, VVAF opened a clinic on the outskirts of Phnom Penh to offer rehabilitative services to landmine victims.

==Projects==
One of VVAF&#x27;s primary causes is Campaign for a Landmine Free World, which works to increase awareness of the world&#x27;s landmine crisis. As of 2002, VVAF operated programs in Angola, Cambodia, El Salvador, Kosovo, Sierra Leone and Vietnam.

Since early 1998, a number of top musical artists have contributed to the cause through VVAF&#x27;s Artists for a Landmine Free World. Some of the program&#x27;s most active members include Emmylou Harris, Sheryl Crow, Steve Earle, Nanci Griffith, Willie Nelson, Lucinda Williams, Bruce Cockburn, Bruce Springsteen, and Mary Chapin Carpenter.

VVAF was a cofounder of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), which was awarded the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize jointly with coordinator Jody Williams of the VVAF. Loung Ung serves as National Spokesperson for the Campaign for a Landmine-Free World.

===Post-Conflict Rehabilitation===
Many survivors of war require physical and emotional rehabilitation. VVAF&#x27;s Post-Conflict Rehabilitation Program (PCR) provides support through product services, physical and emotional training, and sport rehabilitation. It has provided rehabilitation services in Angola, Ethiopia, Cambodia, and Vietnam, and supports rehabilitation and disability programs throughout Central America and Sub-Saharan Africa. Thousands of people who suffer from disabilities caused by war or debilitating diseases such as polio and clubfoot benefit every year from artificial limbs, braces and wheelchairs produced at VVAF clinics. In addition, patients are enrolled in physical therapy sessions where they develop the strength, flexibility and skills to become mobile again. VVAF&#x27;s community follow-up and outreach teams bring assistance to people where they live. And through the creation of self-help groups and the implementation of sports and recreation activities through its Sports for Life initiative, people develop the confidence, skills, and social networks necessary to become active participants in their societies.

===Sports for life===
Sports for Life (SFL), a project of PCR, uses athletic activity and play as vehicles for bringing about positive changes in the lives of people with disabilities. The SFL program uses therapeutic and competitive sports to rehabilitate disabled persons in war-affected nations, helping them to build physical and social skills and develop the confidence to improve their lives in other ways. SFL has conducted successful programs in Kosovo, Angola and Cambodia. In March 2006 two athletic superstars, 2000 NFL MVP Ray Lewis and Paralympian Cheri Blauwet joined the Sports for Life Advisory Committee and travelled to Africa with VVAF to support and promote new developments in Ethiopia and Angola.

===Information Management and Mine Action Programs===
VVAF&#x27;s Information Management and Mine Action Programs (iMMAP) works in post-conflict countries, including Iraq, Vietnam and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to evaluate the impact of landmines and provide technical assistance to coordinate information necessary for relief and development. IMMAP started from the basic premise that implementing organizations, national authorities and donor governments needed to be able to define the global landmine problem&#x27;s physical, social and economic dimensions as a prerequisite for effective planning, resource allocation and advocacy. Its efforts resulted in broad international acceptance of landmine survey standards and socio-economic measures of landmine/UXO impact. In the winter of 2005 and beginning of 2006, tsunamis and earthquakes devastated much of Southeast Asia and Pakistan. iMMAP&#x27;s information management support helped guide and maximize relief efforts by assisting in surveying hazardous and safe routes for transportation, supplies and locations for shelter. In January 2006, an iMMAP survey of Iraqi communities found that one in five areas in northern and southern Iraq were endangered by landmines and other unexploded ordnance.

===Nuclear threat reduction===
VVAF&#x27;s Nuclear Threat Reduction Campaign (NTRC) educates and mobilizes key constituencies to advance US public policy on a bipartisan basis that reduces the threats posed by nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. In late 2005, NTRC was largely responsible for the rejection of a government bill that would have allowed the use of robust nuclear earth penetrator (RNEP) bombs, commonly known as &quot;bunker busters&quot;.

===War Kids Relief and Returnee Integration Support===
VVAF&#x27;s newest programs, War Kids Relief and Returnee Integration Support Program were launched in November 2005. War Kids Relief, led by former Iraq veteran and captain Jon Powers, helps of Iraqi children recover from the disruptive effects of war. The program works to improve the physical conditions of existing housing facilities and provide training to orphanage directors and caregivers, integrate children back into safe family environments, and with Construct a Baghdad Career and Life Skills Center works to provide a safe haven for older children (age 12–18) and give them a place to learn job and life-training skills.

===Returnee Integration Support===
The Returnee Integration Support Program (RISP) helps Cambodian refugees readjust to Cambodia&#x27;s lifestyle and culture. Through its services, the program provides orientation, assistance with employment and housing, drug, alcohol and HIV education, Khmer literacy classes, counseling and referral services, in order to support returnees who seek help in becoming independent and productive members of society.

<text>CQD (transmitted in Morse code as ) is one of the first distress signals adopted for radio use. On 7 January 1904 the Marconi International Marine Communication Company issued &quot;Circular 57&quot;, which specified that, for the company&#x27;s installations, beginning 1 February 1904 &quot;the call to be given by ships in distress or in any way requiring assistance shall be &#x27;C Q D&#x27; &quot;.

==Background==
Landline and submarine telegraphers&#x27; telegraphs had adopted the convention of using the station code &quot;CQ&quot; to all stations along a telegraph line. As the first wireless operators were taken from the already trained landline telegraphers, the current practices carried forward and CQ had then been adopted in maritime radiotelegraphy as a &quot;general call&quot; to any ship or land station.

The Marconi company added a &quot;D&quot; (&quot;distress&quot;) to CQ in order to create a distress call. Thus, &quot;CQD&quot; was understood by wireless operators to mean &quot;All stations: Distress&quot;. Although used worldwide by Marconi operators, CQD was never adopted as an international standard, since it can easily be mistaken for a mere general call &quot;CQ&quot; when reception is poor.

==Replacement==
At the first International Radiotelegraphic Convention, held in Berlin in 1906, Germany&#x27;s &quot;&quot; distress signal of three-dots three-dashes three-dots () was adopted as the international Morse code distress signal.

This signal soon became known as SOS because it has the same dash-dot sequence as the letters with the gaps between them removed, and in fact is properly written , with an overbar, to distinguish it from the three individual letters. In contrast, CQD is transmitted as three distinct letters with a short gap between each, like regular text. SOS is also easier to hear as it is nine symbols long, while no other character or sign is longer than six symbols. Germany had first adopted SOS in regulations effective 1 April 1905.

==History of wireless distress rescues==
From 1899 to 1908, nine documented rescues were made by the use of wireless. The earliest of these was a distress call from the &quot;East Goodwin&quot; lightship. However, for the earliest of these, there was no standardized distress signal. The first US ship to send a wireless distress call in 1905 simply sent HELP (in both International Morse and American Morse code).

On 7 December 1903, Ludwig Arnson was a wireless operator aboard the liner when the ship lost a propeller off the Irish coast. His call of CQD brought aid from a British cruiser. In 1944 Arnson received the Marconi Memorial Medal of Achievement in recognition of his sending the first wireless distress signal. By February 1904, the Marconi Wireless Company required all its operators to use CQD for a ship in distress or for requiring URGENT assistance. In the early morning of 23 January 1909, whilst sailing into New York from Liverpool, collided with the Italian liner SS &quot;Florida&quot; in fog off the Massachusetts island of Nantucket. Radio Operator Jack Binns sent the CQD distress signal by wireless transmission.

On 15 April 1912, radio operator Jack Phillips initially sent &quot;CQD&quot;, which was still commonly used by British ships. Harold Bride, the junior radio operator, suggested using , saying half-jokingly that it might be his last chance to use the new code. Phillips thereafter began to alternate between the two. Although Bride survived, Phillips perished in the sinking.

<doc id="147060" wikidata="Q1129306" url="?curid=147060" title="2002 French presidential election">
<text>Presidential elections were held in France on 21 April 2002, with a runoff election between the top two candidates, incumbent Jacques Chirac of the Rally for the Republic and Jean-Marie Le Pen of the National Front, on 5 May. This presidential contest attracted a greater than usual amount of international attention because of candidate Le Pen&#x27;s unexpected appearance in the runoff election.

Chirac ran for a second term, reduced to five years instead of seven previously by a 2000 referendum, emphasising a strong economy (mostly unaffected by downturns in Germany and the United States). It was widely expected that Chirac and Lionel Jospin, the outgoing cohabitation Prime Minister and nominee of the Socialist Party, would be the most popular candidates in the first round, thus going on to face each other in the runoff, with opinion polls showing a hypothetical Chirac versus Jospin second round too close to call. However, Jospin unexpectedly finished in third place behind Le Pen. Journalists and politicians claimed polls had failed to predict Le Pen&#x27;s second-place finish in the general election, though his strong stance could be seen in the week prior to the election. This led to serious discussions about polling techniques, the climate of French politics and especially the high numbers of candidate from the left-wing.

Although Le Pen&#x27;s political party, the National Front, described itself as mainstream conservative, observers largely agreed in defining it as a far-right and nationalist party. As a protest, almost all French political parties called for their supporters to vote against Le Pen, most notably the Socialists, who were traditionally billed as the archrivals to Chirac&#x27;s party. Chirac thus went on to win in the largest landslide in a presidential election in French history (greater even than that of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte in 1848, the first by direct ballot), winning over 82% of the vote.

The National Front would not appear again in the second round of the presidential election until 2017. After Chirac&#x27;s victory, no French president would win a second term until Emmanuel Macron in 2022.

==Background==
The 2002 election was the first for which the president would be elected to a five-year, instead of a seven-year, term.

In the months before the election, the campaign had increasingly focused on questions of law and order, with a particular focus on crimes committed by young people, especially those of foreign origin. Lionel Jospin was, at the time, Prime Minister of France; the Jospin government was criticised for its &quot;softness&quot; on crime by its political opponents. Reporting on the TF1 and France2 television channel and other media also emphasized the alleged crime wave.

==Opinion polls==

;First round 

;Second round (Chirac–Jospin)
==Results==
The first round of the election (on 21 April), which saw an exceptional number of 16 candidates, came as a shock to many commentators, almost all of whom had expected the second ballot to be between Jacques Chirac and Lionel Jospin. Indeed, it was this very expectation that led to Jospin&#x27;s downfall, with a plethora of &quot;small party&quot; left candidates (independent socialists and republicans, Green, Communist, Trotskyist, radical etc.) all intending to support him in the second round, but to raise their profile in the first, like Jean-Pierre Chevènement and Christiane Taubira. They cumulatively took enough votes away from Jospin to (unintentionally) prevent him from reaching the second round, which he could have won. Instead Jean-Marie Le Pen faced Chirac in the second ballot. The election brought the opinion polls and two-round voting system into question as well as raising many concerns about apathy and the way in which the left had become so divided as a result of the over democratical refusal of Jospin to strategically ask the nearest small parties of his own government coalition to withdraw, like the preceding leaders of the left had done for such an election.

There was a widespread stirring of national public opinion, and more than one million people in France took part in street rallies, in an expression of fierce opposition to Le Pen&#x27;s ideas. Some held up protest signs stating &quot;I&#x27;m ashamed to be French,&quot; which parodied Le Pen&#x27;s party slogan, &quot;Proud to be French.&quot; Spontaneous street protests began in the night from 21 to 22 April, then on 22 April and 23, then as follows:

* 24 April: 60,000 people in the streets protesting against Le Pen&#x27;s success
* 25 April: 250,000 people in the streets protesting against Le Pen&#x27;s success
* 27 April: 200,000 people in the streets protesting against Le Pen&#x27;s success (including 45,000 in Paris)
* 1 May:
** Approximately 20,000 people turned out for the National Front&#x27;s yearly demonstration in Paris in honor of Joan of Arc and in support of Le Pen.
** Between 900,000 (according to the Ministry of the Interior) and 1,300,000 people (according to syndicates) turned up to the Labor Day demonstrations and against the National Front. Hundreds of thousands of people who normally did not take part in such demonstrations came, in addition to the usual unions. In Paris, 500,000 people were seen in the streets, one of the greatest protest since the Liberation of Paris; the march was so big it had to be divided in three parts to reach the place de la Bastille. In another unusual sight for 1 May demonstrations, French tricolour flags were commonplace.

A 2025 study found that the protests against Le Pen &quot;reduced the number of votes for Le Pen and abstention, while increasing the number of votes for the incumbent president, Jacques Chirac.&quot; The protests also &quot;reduced support for the policies advocated by Le Pen. Moreover, the positive effect on voting for Chirac resulted from right-wing voters switching from Le Pen to Chirac and left-wing voters not casting a blank ballot, implying that some voters voted expressively. Finally, we show that protests reduced the social desirability of voting for Le Pen.&quot;

The choice between Chirac, who was under suspicion for actions carried out whilst he was mayor of Paris but benefited from presidential immunity as long as he stayed president, and Le Pen, a nationalist often accused of racism and antisemitism, was one that many found tough. Some people suggested going to vote with a clothes peg on their noses to express disgust when voting for Chirac, but this may have been illegal, because it is prohibited to advertise one&#x27;s vote inside the voting precinct. In the days before the second ballot, a memorable poster was put up of Chirac with the slogan &quot;Vote for the Crook, not the Fascist&quot;. Chirac defeated Le Pen by a landslide.

<text>Milton Teagle &quot;Richard&quot; Simmons (July 12, 1948 – July 13, 2024) was an American fitness instructor and television personality. He was a promoter of weight-loss programs, most prominently through his television show, &quot;The Richard Simmons Show&quot; and later the &quot;Sweatin&#x27; to the Oldies&quot; line of aerobics videos.

Simmons began his weight-loss career by opening his gym Slimmons in Beverly Hills, California, catering to the overweight in a supportive atmosphere, and he became widely known through exposure on television and through the popularity of his consumer products. He was often parodied and was a frequent guest on late-night television and radio talk shows, such as the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;.

He continued to promote health and exercise through a decades-long career, and later broadened his activities to include political activism, such as in 2008 in support of a bill mandating non-competitive physical education in public schools as a part of the No Child Left Behind Act.

==Early life==
Milton Teagle Simmons was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on July 12, 1948, to Leonard Douglas Simmons Sr. and Shirley May ( Satin). He was born to &quot;show-business parents&quot; and raised in the French Quarter of New Orleans. Simmons had an older brother. Their father was raised Methodist and worked as a master of ceremonies and later in thrift stores while their mother was Russian Jewish and was a traveling fan dancer and later a store cosmetics saleswoman.

Simmons became a practicing Catholic in adolescence and attended Cor Jesu High School. He attended the University of Louisiana at Lafayette before graduating from Florida State University with a Bachelor of Arts in art.

He became obese during his early childhood and adolescence. He began to overeat and became overweight as early as the age of 4 and by the age of 5, he knew it was perceived negatively. At the age of 15, he weighed . As a young man, he considered being a priest. As a young art student, he appeared among the &quot;freak show&quot; characters in the Fellini films &quot;Satyricon&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Clowns&quot; (1970) and he eventually reached a peak of .

In an interview with the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot;, Simmons explained he adopted the name Richard after an uncle who paid for his college tuition. His first job in New Orleans was as a child, selling pralines at Leah&#x27;s Pralines.

==Career==
===Fitness career===

Upon moving to Los Angeles in the 1970s, Simmons worked as the &quot;maître d&#x27;hôtel&quot; at Derek&#x27;s, a restaurant in Beverly Hills. He developed an interest in fitness. Exercise studios of the day favored the already fit customer, so little help was available for those who needed to gain fitness from an otherwise unhealthy state. He established gyms and his interest in fitness helped him lose .

He opened his own exercise studio, originally called The Anatomy Asylum, where emphasis was placed on healthy eating in proper portions and enjoyable exercise in a supportive atmosphere. The business originally included a salad bar restaurant called Ruffage, a pun on the word &quot;roughage&quot; (dietary fiber); though it was eventually removed as the focus of The Anatomy Asylum shifted solely to exercise. Later renamed Slimmons, the establishment continued operations in Beverly Hills and Simmons taught motivational classes and aerobics throughout the week. His success led to a recurring role in &quot;General Hospital&quot; portraying himself over a four-year period and then to his own television series &quot;The Richard Simmons Show&quot;, which aired from 1980 to 1984 and earned him multiple Emmy awards. Rising interest in aerobics during the 1980s led to the popularization of Simmons&#x27; line of fitness videos, particularly his &quot;Sweatin&#x27; to the Oldies&quot; series, which became one of the most popular videos during the decade.
In 2010, Simmons stated he had maintained his own 100+ pound (45 kg) weight loss for 42 years, had been helping others lose weight for 35 years, and that in the course of his fitness career, had helped humanity lose approximately 12 million pounds (5.5 million kg).

===In media===
Simmons began to receive media attention due to the success of his health club that started with him on &quot;Real People&quot; (where he was shown at work). He introduced customers whom he had helped to lose weight. He later had guest roles on &quot;Battlestars&quot;, &quot;Super Password&quot;, &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot;, &quot;Body Language&quot;, &quot;Match Game&quot; (ABC), &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; (syndicated), and Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Figure It Out&quot;. Positive viewer reactions landed Simmons a recurring role as himself in &quot;General Hospital&quot; over a four-year period. This, as well as being in shopping malls (where he taught exercise classes), led to further media attention. In the early 1980s, Simmons hosted two shows — &quot;Slim Cookin&quot; and the Emmy Award-winning talk show &quot;The Richard Simmons Show&quot;, in which he focused on personal health, fitness, exercise, and healthy cooking. Simmons portrayed himself in the &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; episode &quot;Remote Control Man&quot;. Simmons was a guest on &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot; on November 18, 1997, together with Celine Dion. He was a frequent guest on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, his last appearance coming in 2013.

Simmons was also a guest on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; (NBC) and the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; (CBS), but on November 22, 2000, they had a falling-out after an incident on that night&#x27;s show. Simmons (while dressed as a turkey) grabbed Letterman as if to hug or kiss him, to which Letterman responded by spraying Simmons with a fire extinguisher, which made Simmons have a severe asthma attack. Simmons did not appear on the Letterman show for six years, finally returning on November 29, 2006. During that time, Letterman once again set Simmons up for a prank; while Simmons was demonstrating a steamer branded with his name, Letterman insisted on placing a tray under the steamer which Simmons did not believe belonged there. When Simmons turned the steamer on, something in the tray exploded and caught fire, sending Simmons running for his life. Despite the scare, Simmons took the incident in fairly good nature, even joking that he &quot;felt like Michael Jackson&quot; (referring to a mishap where Jackson&#x27;s hair was accidentally set on fire by pyrotechnics while filming a Pepsi commercial).

In 1998, Simmons provided the voice of Boone in &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: The Movie&quot;. He featured as himself on numerous television series, including &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;, &quot;CHiPs&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, and in the &quot;Arrested Development&quot; episode &quot;Bringing Up Buster&quot;. In 1999, he hosted the short-lived television series &quot;DreamMaker&quot;. On January 14, 2000, Simmons and Tribune Entertainment parted ways, following low ratings. In 2007, he filmed the PBS pledge-drive special &quot;Love Yourself and Win&quot;.

He also featured in television advertisements for Sprint, Yoplait, and Herbal Essence shampoos. In late 2007, he was in a &quot;This is SportsCenter&quot; commercial on ESPN as the show&#x27;s &quot;conditioning coach&quot;. In the &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; episode &quot;No Pain, No Gain&quot;, Simmons voiced an exercise trainer bearing his animated likeness, leading a class filled with large, anthropomorphic animals.

Simmons appeared multiple times on &quot;The Glenn Beck Program&quot; on HLN. From 2006 to 2008, he hosted a radio show on Sirius Stars (Sirius Satellite Radio channel 102) titled &quot;Lighten Up with Richard Simmons&quot;. He provided the voice of Coach Salmons, a recurring character modeled after his own likeness, for &quot;Fish Hooks&quot;. In 2011, Simmons starred in &quot;Fit to Fly with Richard Simmons&quot;, an Air New Zealand inflight safety briefing video modeled after his aerobic workouts. He is featured heavily in the film clip of &quot;Hawker Boat&quot; by Tobacco, taken from the album &quot;Fucked Up Friends&quot;.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Simmons&#x27; YouTube channel was updated with archival exercise videos (recorded before his decision to withdraw from public life) to help people stay fit at home. A spokesperson said the move was motivated by an &quot;overwhelming request for Richard to return in some way as a comfort&quot; and added that Simmons was &quot;very touched by the outreach&quot;.

In January 2024, an as-yet untitled biopic about Simmons, starring Pauly Shore, was announced, titled &quot;The Court Jester&quot;. Simmons stated on Facebook, &quot;I have never given my permission for this movie.&quot; In April, he said he was discussing giving his approval for a different biopic.

==Personal life==
===Religion===
Simmons became Catholic as a teenager, having first asked his parents if he could convert as a younger child. He attended church with his brother Lenny for years until being baptized and confirmed on the same day. He considered the priesthood for a time, but decided against it.

He lapsed as an older adult, but returned to the faith in his later years.

===Personality===

Simmons used his energetic, loud, and motivational demeanor to encourage people to lose weight. His high energy level was always featured in his workout videos. His trademark attire was tank tops decorated with Swarovski crystals and candy-striped Dolphin shorts.

Simmons interacted at a personal level with fans and people using his products. This began by personally answering fan mail he received as a cast member of &quot;General Hospital&quot;. As late as 2008, he personally answered emails and letters and made hundreds of phone calls each week to those who would seek his help.

He claimed to have few friends, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t have a lot to offer to one person. I have a lot to offer to a lot of people.&quot; Aside from his six Dalmatians and two maids, Simmons lived alone in Beverly Hills, California. Although his persona inspired speculation about his sexual orientation, he never publicly addressed the subject. After his death in 2024, Jane Fonda stated she had last seen him for lunch at the Polo Lounge, when he was accompanied by his new boyfriend.

In a 2012 interview with &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot;, he was quoted:
===Assault charge===
In March 2004, Simmons was cited for Misdemeanor assault after he slapped Christopher Farney in the face at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. The slap was in response to Farney making a remark poking fun at Simmons’ exercise videos. In May 2004, a judge dismissed the assault charge after Simmons reached a private settlement with Farney.

===Hurricane Katrina response===
In September 2005, Simmons appeared on &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; to discuss the effects of Hurricane Katrina on his family in his hometown of New Orleans, and his involvement in aiding those affected by the hurricane. On August 29, 2006, Simmons was on &quot;Your World with Neil Cavuto&quot; while making a return visit to New Orleans one year after the flooding, a visit he repeated on March 2, 2007, now talking about his recent trip to Washington, D.C., to promote and raise awareness about the Strengthening Physical Education Act of 2007 (H.R. 1224).

===Retirement===
After 2014, Simmons did not make any major public appearances. He stopped appearing in public altogether on February 15 of that year. In March 2016, speculation began that he was being held hostage by his housekeeper. In response, on March 14, Simmons gave an audio interview on &quot;The Today Show&quot;, denying the rumors and assuring the public that he is fine. In November 2016, the Simmons fitness gym closed without any public announcement from Simmons. In February 2017, the podcast &quot;Missing Richard Simmons&quot; launched, investigating why Simmons left public life so suddenly.

In March the same year, Los Angeles Police Department detectives visited Simmons&#x27; home to conduct a welfare check, issuing a statement that Simmons is &quot;perfectly fine&quot; and that &quot;right now he is doing what he wants to do and it is his business&quot;. On April 19, following a hospitalization for severe indigestion, Simmons made his first public comment in over a year, posting on Facebook a photo of himself and the message &quot;I&#x27;m not &#x27;missing&#x27;, just a little under the weather&quot;. However, the picture that was included in the post was from as far back as 2013, leading to speculation that the person who posted the message might not actually have been Simmons.

In May 2017, he sued the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;, Radar Online, and American Media, Inc. for libel and false claims that he was undergoing gender reassignment. In September 2017, Simmons lost the lawsuit and was ordered to pay the defendants&#x27; attorney&#x27;s fees. The judge ruled, &quot;because courts have long held that a misidentification of certain immutable characteristics do not naturally tend to injure one&#x27;s reputation, even if there is sizeable portion of the population who hold prejudices against those characteristics, misidentification of a person as transgender is not actionable defamation absent special damages&quot;.

In June 2018, he sued a Los Angeles private investigator, claiming he had placed a tracking device over a year earlier on the only vehicle Simmons used for transportation, noting that such tracking is in violation of California law. In July 2018, Simmons amended the suit, alleging the investigator had been hired by &quot;In Touch Weekly&quot; and prosecutors filed a criminal complaint. In May 2020, a California appellate court upheld a trial judge&#x27;s decision allowing Simmons&#x27; lawsuit to move forward.

In August 2022, in response to continued rumors and a TMZ documentary &quot;What Really Happened to Richard Simmons&quot; claiming that knee problems forced Simmons out of public life, Simmons issued a statement to the &quot;New York Post&quot; that he is &quot;happy, healthy, and living the life he has chosen to live&quot;.

Teresa Reveles, who worked as Simmons&#x27; house manager and was often erroneously referred to as his housekeeper in news reports, said that Simmons retired due to failing knees which required surgery and made him unable to have the flexibility necessary to teach his fitness classes. He did not want to continue working if he was not able to fully perform up to expectations. Simmons was also nervous about aging, claiming to her that he did not &quot;look that beautiful anymore&quot;. Even after he retreated from the public spotlight, he still frequently traveled outside of his house locally in disguises and continued to motivate fans by calling and emailing them as much as he could. He would donate to charities.

Two days before his death, Simmons had conducted his first interview in a significant amount of time with &quot;People&quot;. On his birthday, Simmons stated that he is grateful to be alive for another day and would spend his birthday helping people. Instead of cake, he stated he would have a candle on a zucchini, stating he is a vegetarian. He added, &quot;Okay, fine. Maybe one Pepperidge Farm Milano cookie. But just one. Sure, once in a while, have dessert.&quot; He was also calling and motivating people again and writing a Broadway musical about his life in collaboration with composer Patrick Leonard, as well as planning for a longer comeback interview with Diane Sawyer.

== Illness and death ==

===Health===
In March 2024, Simmons issued a statement clarifying that he was not dying after a Facebook post he wrote encouraging people to &quot;embrace every day&quot; drew public concern. He also stated that he no longer had a manager or publicist, and that he had not given permission for a biopic of him. That same month, Simmons revealed that he had been diagnosed with skin cancer, located underneath his right eye. Simmons later stated on his Twitter account that the cancer diagnosis occurred &quot;so many years ago&quot; and he decided to speak out about it to encourage people to go to the doctor if they see anything unusual on their body.

===Death===
On July 13, 2024, Simmons died at his home in Los Angeles at the age of 76. He had suffered a fall at his home in his bathroom two days prior and refused to seek medical attention until the following morning out of a desire to spend his 76th birthday at home. He went to bed and the next day, he posted on social media that he never got so many birthday wishes. He was found by his long-time house manager Teresa Reveles the next day. Police said that his death appeared to be from natural causes, though the investigation is ongoing; Reveles suspected that Simmons had suffered a heart attack in his sleep. He was buried at Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park and Mortuary, dressed in his trademark fitness outfit. On August 21, in a report given to Simmons&#x27; brother, the Los Angeles County Coroner&#x27;s office confirmed that Simmons had died of complications of the previous day&#x27;s fall, among others, and that heart disease was a contributing factor; no unprescribed drugs had been in his system when he died.

On July 20, one week after his death, Simmons&#x27; team shared what would be his final social media post, a paraphrase of lyrics from the song &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot;. On October 5, a memorial mass for Simmons was held at St. Louis Cathedral in New Orleans, Louisiana.

<doc id="147073" wikidata="Q82222" url="?curid=147073" title="Little Richard">
<text>Richard Wayne Penniman (December 5, 1932 – May 9, 2020), known professionally as Little Richard, was an American singer, pianist, and songwriter. He was an influential figure in popular music and culture for seven decades. Described as the &quot;Architect of Rock and Roll&quot;, Richard&#x27;s most celebrated work dates from the mid-1950s, when his charismatic showmanship and dynamic music, characterized by frenetic piano playing, pounding backbeat and powerful raspy vocals, laid the foundation for rock and roll. Richard&#x27;s innovative emotive vocalizations and uptempo rhythmic music played a key role in the formation of other popular music genres, including soul and funk. He influenced singers and musicians across musical genres from rock to hip hop; his music helped shape rhythm and blues for generations.

&quot;Tutti Frutti&quot; (1955), one of Richard&#x27;s signature songs, became an instant hit, crossing over to the pop charts in the United States and the United Kingdom. His next hit single, &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; (1956), hit No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Rhythm and Blues Best-Sellers chart, followed by a rapid succession of fifteen more in less than three years. In 1962, after a five-year period during which Richard abandoned rock and roll music for born-again Christianity, concert promoter Don Arden persuaded him to tour Europe. During this time, the Beatles opened for Richard on some tour dates.

Richard is cited as one of the first crossover black artists, reaching audiences of all races. His music and concerts broke the color line, drawing black and white people together despite attempts to sustain segregation. Many of his contemporaries, including Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, Bill Haley, Jerry Lee Lewis, the Everly Brothers, Gene Vincent, Pat Boone, and Eddie Cochran, recorded covers of his works.
Richard was honored by many institutions. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of its first group of inductees in 1986. He was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. He was the recipient of Lifetime Achievement Awards from The Recording Academy and the Rhythm and Blues Foundation. In 2015, Richard received a Rhapsody &amp; Rhythm Award from the National Museum of African American Music. &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot; was included in the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2010, which stated that his &quot;unique vocalizing over the irresistible beat announced a new era in music&quot;.

==Early life==
Richard Wayne Penniman was born in Macon, Georgia, on December 5, 1932, the third of twelve children of Leva Mae (née Stewart) and Charles &quot;Bud&quot; Penniman. His father was a church deacon and a brick mason, who sold bootlegged moonshine on the side and owned a nightclub called the Tip in Inn. His mother was a member of Macon&#x27;s New Hope Baptist Church. Initially, his first name was supposed to have been &quot;Ricardo&quot;, but an error switched it to &quot;Richard&quot;. The Penniman children were raised in Macon&#x27;s Pleasant Hill neighborhood. In childhood, he was nicknamed &quot;Lil&#x27; Richard&quot; by his family because of his small and skinny frame. He was a mischievous child who played pranks on neighbors. He began singing in church and taking piano lessons at a young age. Possibly as a result of complications at birth, he had a slight deformity that left one of his legs shorter than the other. This produced an unusual gait, and he was mocked for his effeminate appearance.

His family was religious and joined various A.M.E., Baptist, and Pentecostal churches, with some family members becoming ministers. He enjoyed the Pentecostal churches the most, because of their charismatic worship and live music. He later recalled that people in his neighborhood sang gospel songs throughout the day during segregation to keep a positive outlook, because &quot;there was so much poverty, so much prejudice in those days&quot;. He had observed that people sang &quot;to feel their connection with God&quot; and to wash their trials and burdens away. Gifted with a loud singing voice, he recalled that he was &quot;always changing the key upwards&quot; and that he was once stopped from singing in church for &quot;screaming and hollering&quot; so loud, earning him the nickname &quot;War Hawk&quot;. As a child, he would &quot;beat on the steps of the house, and on tin cans and pots and pans, or whatever&quot; while singing, which annoyed neighbors.

His initial musical influences were gospel performers such as Brother Joe May, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Mahalia Jackson, and Marion Williams. May, a singing evangelist who was known as &quot;the Thunderbolt of the Middle West&quot; because of his phenomenal range and vocal power, inspired Richard to become a preacher. He credited the Clara Ward Singers for one of his distinctive hollers. Richard attended Macon&#x27;s Hudson High School, where he was a below-average student. He eventually learned to play alto saxophone, joining his school&#x27;s marching band in fifth grade. While in high school, he got a part-time job at Macon City Auditorium for local secular and gospel concert promoter Clint Brantley. He sold Coca-Cola to crowds during concerts of star performers of the day such as Cab Calloway, Lucky Millinder, and his favorite singer, Sister Rosetta Tharpe.

==Music career==
===1947–1955: Beginnings===
In October 1947, Sister Rosetta Tharpe overheard the fourteen-year-old Richard singing her songs before a performance at the Macon City Auditorium. She invited him to open her show. After the show, Tharpe paid him, inspiring him to become a professional performer. In 1949, he began performing in Doctor Nubillo&#x27;s traveling show. Richard was inspired to wear turbans and capes in his career by Nubillo, who also &quot;carried a black stick and exhibited something he called &#x27;the devil&#x27;s child&#x27;—the dried-up body of a baby with claw feet like a bird and horns on its head.&quot; Nubillo told Richard he was &quot;gonna be famous&quot;.

Before entering the tenth grade, Richard left his family home and joined Hudson&#x27;s Medicine Show in 1949, performing Louis Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Caldonia&quot;. Richard recalled that the song was the first secular R&amp;B song he learned since his family had strict rules against playing R&amp;B music, which they considered &quot;devil music&quot;. Other sources also indicate that Little Richard was influenced by Jordan. In fact, according to one reliable source, the whoop sound on Jordan&#x27;s record &quot;Caldonia&quot; sounds eerily like the vocal tone Little Richard would adopt in addition to the &quot;Jordan-style pencil-thin mustache&quot;.

Richard also performed in drag during this time, performing under the name &quot;Princess LaVonne&quot;. In 1950, Richard joined his first musical band, Buster Brown&#x27;s Orchestra, where Brown named him Little Richard. Performing in the minstrel show circuit, Richard, in and out of drag, appeared for vaudeville acts such as Sugarfoot Sam from Alabam, the Tidy Jolly Steppers, the King Brothers Circus, and the Broadway Follies. Having settled in Atlanta at this point, Richard began listening to rhythm and blues and frequented Atlanta clubs, including the Harlem Theater and the Royal Peacock, where he saw performers such as Roy Brown and Billy Wright onstage. Richard was further influenced by Brown&#x27;s and Wright&#x27;s flashy showmanship and even more so by Wright&#x27;s flamboyant persona. Inspired by Brown and Wright, he decided to become a rhythm-and-blues singer. After befriending Wright, he began to learn how to be an entertainer from him, and began adapting a pompadour hairdo similar to Wright&#x27;s, wearing flashier clothes, and using Wright&#x27;s brand of pancake makeup.

Impressed by his singing voice, Wright put him in contact with Zenas Sears, a local DJ. Sears recorded Richard at his station, backed by Wright&#x27;s band. The recordings led to a contract that year with RCA Victor. Richard recorded a total of eight sides for RCA Victor, including the blues ballad, &quot;Every Hour&quot;, which became his first single and a hit in Georgia. The release of &quot;Every Hour&quot; improved his relationship with his father, who began regularly playing the song on his nightclub jukebox. Shortly after the release of &quot;Every Hour&quot;, Richard was hired to front Perry Welch and His Orchestra and played at clubs and army bases for $100 a week. Richard left RCA Victor in February 1952 after his records failed to chart; the recordings were marketed with little promotion, although ads for the records showed up in &quot;Billboard&quot;.

After his father&#x27;s death in 1952, Richard began to find success through RCA Victor&#x27;s reissue of the recordings on the budget RCA Camden label. He continued to perform during this time and Clint Brantley agreed to manage Richard&#x27;s career. Moving to Houston, he formed a band called the Tempo Toppers, performing as part of blues package tours in Southern clubs such as Club Tijuana in New Orleans and Club Matinee in Houston. Richard signed with Don Robey&#x27;s Peacock Records in February 1953, recording eight sides, including four with Johnny Otis and his band that were not released at that time. Like his venture with RCA Victor, none of his Peacock singles charted, despite his growing reputation for high energy antics onstage. Richard began complaining of monetary issues with Robey, leading Robey to knock him out during a scuffle.

Disillusioned by the record business, Richard returned to Macon in 1954. Struggling with poverty, he settled for work as a dishwasher for Greyhound Lines. While in Macon, he met Esquerita, whose flamboyant onstage persona and dynamic piano playing would deeply influence Richard&#x27;s approach. That year, he disbanded the Tempo Toppers and formed a harder-driving rhythm and blues band, the Upsetters, which included drummer Charles Connor and saxophonist Wilbert &quot;Lee Diamond&quot; Smith that toured under Brantley&#x27;s management. The band supported R&amp;B singer Christine Kittrell on some recordings, then began to tour successfully, even without a bassist, forcing drummer Connor to thump &quot;real hard&quot; on his bass drum to get a &quot;bass fiddle effect&quot;. In 1954, Richard signed on to a Southern tour with Little Johnny Taylor.
At the suggestion of Lloyd Price, Richard sent a demo to Price&#x27;s label, Specialty Records, in February 1955. Months passed before Richard got a call from the label. Finally, in September of that year, Specialty owner Art Rupe loaned Richard money to buy out his Peacock contract and set him to work with producer Robert &quot;Bumps&quot; Blackwell. Upon hearing the demo, Blackwell felt Richard was Specialty&#x27;s answer to Ray Charles, however, Richard told him he preferred the sound of Fats Domino. Blackwell sent him to New Orleans where he recorded at Cosimo Matassa&#x27;s J&amp;M Studios, recording there with several of Domino&#x27;s session musicians, including drummer Earl Palmer and saxophonist Lee Allen. Richard&#x27;s recordings that day failed to produce much inspiration or interest (although Blackwell saw some promise).

Frustrated, Blackwell and Richard went to relax at the Dew Drop Inn nightclub. According to Blackwell, Richard then launched into a risqué dirty blues he titled &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot;. Blackwell said he felt the song had hit potential and hired songwriter Dorothy LaBostrie to replace some of Richard&#x27;s sexual lyrics with less controversial ones. Recorded in three takes in September 1955, &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot; was released as a single that November and became an instant hit, reaching No. 2 on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Rhythm and Blues Best-Sellers chart and crossing over to the pop charts in both the United States and the United Kingdom. It reached No. 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 in America and No. 29 on the British singles chart, eventually selling a million copies.

===1956–1962: Initial success and conversion===
Richard&#x27;s next hit single, &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; (1956), hit number one on the R&amp;B chart and number 13 on the Top 100, while reaching the top 10 in Britain. Like &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot;, it sold more than a million copies. Following his success, Richard built up his backup band, The Upsetters, with the addition of saxophonists Clifford &quot;Gene&quot; Burks and leader Grady Gaines, bassist Olsie &quot;Baysee&quot; Robinson and guitarist Nathaniel &quot;Buster&quot; Douglas. Richard began performing on package tours across the United States. Art Rupe described the differences between Richard and a similar hitmaker of the early rock and roll period by stating that, while &quot;the similarities between Little Richard and Fats Domino for recording purposes were close&quot;, Richard would sometimes stand up at the piano while he was recording, and that onstage, where Domino was &quot;plodding, very slow&quot;, Richard was &quot;very dynamic, completely uninhibited, unpredictable, wild. So the band took on the ambience of the vocalist.&quot; Richard&#x27;s high-energy antics included lifting his leg while playing the piano, climbing on top of his piano, running on and off the stage and throwing souvenirs to the audience. He also began using capes and suits studded with multi-colored stones and sequins. Richard said he became more flamboyant onstage so no one would think he was &quot;after the white girls&quot;.

Richard&#x27;s performances, like most early rock and roll shows, resulted in integrated audience reaction during an era where public places were divided into &quot;white&quot; and &quot;colored&quot; domains. In these package tours, Richard and other artists such as Fats Domino and Chuck Berry would enable audiences of both races to enter the building, albeit still segregated (e.g. blacks on the balcony and whites on the main floor). As his later producer H. B. Barnum explained, Richard&#x27;s performances enabled audiences to come together to dance. Despite broadcasts on television from local supremacist groups such as the North Alabama White Citizens Council warning that rock and roll &quot;brings the races together&quot;, Richard&#x27;s popularity was helping to shatter the myth that black performers could not successfully perform at &quot;white-only venues&quot; especially in the South, where racism was most overt.

Richard claims that a show at Baltimore&#x27;s Royal Theatre in June 1956 led to women throwing their undergarments onstage at him, resulting in other female fans repeating the action, saying it was &quot;the first time&quot; that had happened to any artist. Richard&#x27;s show would stop several times that night to restrain fans from jumping off the balcony and then rushing to the stage to touch him.

Overall, Richard produced seven singles in the United States alone in 1956, with five of them also charting in the UK, including &quot;Slippin&#x27; and Slidin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Rip It Up&quot;, &quot;Ready Teddy&quot;, &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; and &quot;Lucille&quot;. Immediately after releasing &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot;, &quot;safer&quot; white recording artists such as Pat Boone covered the song, charting in the top twenty, higher than Richard&#x27;s. His fellow rock and roll peers Elvis Presley and Bill Haley also recorded his songs later that same year. Befriending Alan Freed, the disc jockey eventually put him in his &quot;rock and roll&quot; movies such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock the Rock&quot; and &quot;Mister Rock and Roll&quot;. Richard was given a larger singing role in the film, &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot;. That year, he scored more hit success with songs such as &quot;Jenny, Jenny&quot; and &quot;Keep A-Knockin&#x27;&quot;, the latter becoming his first top ten single on the Billboard Top 100. By the time he left Specialty in 1959, Richard had scored a total of nine top-40 pop singles, as well as seventeen top-40 R&amp;B singles.

On September 2, 1956, Richard performed at the twelfth Cavalcade of Jazz, held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles, which was produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. Also performing that day were Dinah Washington, The Mel Williams Dots, Julie Stevens, Chuck Higgins&#x27; Orchestra, Bo Rhambo, Willie Hayden &amp; Five Black Birds, The Premiers, Gerald Wilson and His 20-Pc. Recording Orchestra, and Jerry Gray and his Orchestra.
Shortly after the release of &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot;, Richard relocated to Los Angeles. After achieving success as a recording artist and live performer, Richard moved into a wealthy, formerly-predominantly-white neighborhood, living close to black celebrities such as boxer Joe Louis. Richard&#x27;s first album, &quot;Here&#x27;s Little Richard&quot;, was released by Specialty in March 1957 and peaked at number thirteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart. Similar to most albums released during that era, the album featured six released singles, as well as &quot;filler&quot; tracks. In October 1957, Richard embarked on a package tour in Australia with Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran. In the middle of the tour, he shocked the public by announcing he was following a life in the ministry. In early 1958, Specialty released his second album, &quot;Little Richard&quot;, which did not chart.

Richard claimed in his autobiography that, during a flight from Melbourne to Sydney, while his plane was experiencing some difficulty, he saw the plane&#x27;s red-hot engines, and felt angels were &quot;holding it up&quot;. At the end of his Sydney performance, Richard saw a bright red fireball flying across the sky above him and claimed he was &quot;deeply shaken&quot;. Though he was eventually told that it was the first artificial Earth satellite Sputnik 1, Richard took it as a &quot;sign from God&quot; to stop performing secular music and repent for his wild lifestyle.

Returning to the States ten days earlier than expected, Richard later read news of his original flight having crashed into the Pacific Ocean, and took it as a further sign to &quot;do as God wanted&quot;. After a &quot;farewell performance&quot; at the Apollo Theater and a &quot;final&quot; recording session with Specialty later that month, Richard enrolled at Oakwood College in Huntsville, Alabama, to study theology. Despite his claims of spiritual rebirth, Richard later admitted his reasons for leaving were more monetary. During his tenure at Specialty, despite earning millions for the label, Richard complained that he did not know the label had reduced the percentage of royalties he was to earn for his recordings. Specialty continued to release Richard&#x27;s recordings, including &quot;Good Golly, Miss Molly&quot;, and his unique version of &quot;Kansas City&quot;, until 1960. Ending his contract with the label, Richard agreed to relinquish royalties for his material.

In 1958, Richard formed the Little Richard Evangelistic Team, traveling across the country to preach. A month after his decision to leave secular music, Richard met Ernestine Harvin, a secretary from Washington, D.C., and the couple married on July 11, 1959. Richard ventured into gospel music, first recording for End Records, before signing with Mercury Records in 1961, where he eventually released &quot;King of the Gospel Singers&quot;, in 1962, produced by Quincy Jones, who later remarked that Richard&#x27;s vocals impressed him more than any other vocalist he had worked with. His childhood heroine, Mahalia Jackson, wrote in the liner notes of the album that Richard &quot;sang gospel the way it should be sung&quot;. While Richard was no longer charting in the U.S., with pop music, some of his gospel songs such as &quot;He&#x27;s Not Just a Soldier&quot; and &quot;He Got What He Wanted&quot;, and &quot;Crying in the Chapel&quot;, reached the pop charts in the U.S. and the UK.

===1962–1979: Return to secular music===
In 1962, concert promoter Don Arden persuaded Little Richard to tour Europe after telling him his records were selling well there. With soul singer Sam Cooke as an opening act, Richard, who featured a teenage Billy Preston in his gospel band, figured it was a gospel tour and, after Cooke&#x27;s delayed arrival forced him to cancel his show on the opening date, performed only gospel material during the show, leading to boos from the audience expecting Richard to sing his rock and roll hits. The following night, Richard viewed Cooke&#x27;s well-received performance. Bringing back his competitive drive, Richard and Preston warmed up in darkness before launching into &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot;, resulting in frenetic, hysterical responses from the audience. A show at Mansfield&#x27;s Granada Theatre ended early after fans rushed the stage.

Hearing of Richard&#x27;s shows, Brian Epstein, manager of the Beatles, asked Don Arden to allow his band to open for Richard on some tour dates, to which he agreed. The first show for which the Beatles opened was at New Brighton&#x27;s Tower Ballroom that October. The following month they, along with Swedish singer Jerry Williams and his band The Violents, opened for Richard at the Star-Club in Hamburg. During this time, Richard advised the group on how to perform his songs and taught Paul McCartney his distinctive vocalizations. Back in the United States, Richard recorded six rock and roll songs with his 1950s band, the Upsetters for Little Star Records, under the name &quot;World Famous Upsetters&quot;, hoping this would keep his options open in maintaining his position as a minister.

In the fall of 1963, Richard was called by a concert promoter to rescue a sagging tour featuring The Everly Brothers, Bo Diddley and the Rolling Stones. Richard agreed and helped to save the tour from flopping. At the end of that tour, Richard was given his own television special for Granada Television titled &quot;The Little Richard Spectacular&quot;. The special became a ratings hit and after 60,000 fan letters, was rebroadcast twice. In 1964, now openly re-embracing rock and roll, Richard released &quot;Bama Lama Bama Loo&quot; on Specialty Records. Due to his UK exposure, the song reached the top twenty there but only hit 82 in the U.S. Later in the year, he signed with Vee-Jay Records, then on its dying legs, to release his &quot;comeback&quot; album, &quot;Little Richard Is Back&quot;. Due to the arrival of the Beatles and other British bands as well as the rise of soul labels such as Motown and Stax Records and the popularity of James Brown, Richard&#x27;s new releases were not well promoted or well received by radio stations. However, his first Vee Jay album made number 136 on a major chart. In November/December 1964, Jimi Hendrix joined Richard&#x27;s Upsetters band as a full member.

In December 1964, Richard brought Hendrix and childhood friend and piano teacher Eskew Reeder to a New York studio to re-record an album&#x27;s worth of his greatest hits. He went on tour with his new group of Upsetters, to promote the album. In early 1965, Richard took Hendrix and Billy Preston to a New York studio where they recorded the Don Covay soul ballad, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know What You&#x27;ve Got (But It&#x27;s Got Me)&quot;, which became a number 12 R&amp;B hit. Three other songs were recorded during the sessions, &quot;Dance a Go Go&quot; aka &quot;Dancin&#x27; All Around the World&quot;, &quot;You Better Stop&quot;, and &quot;Come See About Me&quot; (possibly an instrumental), but &quot;You Better Stop&quot; was not issued until 1971 and &quot;Come See About Me&quot; has yet to see official release. Around this time, Richard and Jimi appeared in a show starring Soupy Sales at the Brooklyn Paramount, New York. Richard&#x27;s flamboyance and drive for dominance reportedly got him thrown off the show.
Hendrix and Richard clashed over the spotlight, as well as Hendrix&#x27;s tardiness, wardrobe and stage antics. Hendrix also complained over his pay. In early July 1965, Richard&#x27;s brother Robert Penniman &quot;fired&quot; Jimi, however, Jimi wrote to his father, Al Hendrix, that he quit Richard as &quot;you can&#x27;t live on promises when you&#x27;re on the road, so I had to cut that mess aloose&quot;. Hendrix had not been paid &quot;for five-and-a-half weeks&quot; and was owed 1,000 dollars. Hendrix then rejoined the Isley Brothers&#x27; band, the IB Specials. Richard later signed with Modern Records, releasing a modest charter, &quot;Do You Feel It?&quot; before leaving for Okeh Records in early 1966. His former Specialty labelmate Larry Williams produced two albums for Richard on Okeh - the studio release &quot;The Explosive Little Richard&quot;, which used a Motown-influenced sound and produced the modest charters &quot;Poor Dog&quot; and &quot;Commandments of Love&quot; and &quot;Little Richard&#x27;s Greatest Hits: Recorded Live!&quot; which returned him to the album charts. Richard was later scathing about this period, declaring Larry Williams &quot;the worst producer in the world&quot;. In 1967, Richard signed with Brunswick Records, but after clashing with the label over musical direction, he left the following year.
Richard felt that producers on his labels did not promote his records during this period. Later, he claimed they kept trying to push him to make records similar to Motown and felt he was not treated with appropriate respect. Richard often performed in dingy clubs and lounges with little support from his label. While Richard managed to perform in huge venues overseas such as in England and France, in the U.S. Richard had to perform on the Chitlin&#x27; Circuit. Richard&#x27;s flamboyant look, while a hit during the 1950s, failed to help his labels to promote him to more conservative black record buyers. Richard later claimed that his decision to &quot;backslide&quot; from his ministry, led religious clergymen to protest his new recordings. Making matters worse, Richard said, was his insistence on performing in front of integrated audiences at the time of the black liberation movement, which caused many black radio disk jockeys in certain areas of the country, including Los Angeles, to choose not to play his music. Now acting as his manager, Larry Williams convinced Richard to focus on his live shows. By 1968, he had ditched the Upsetters for his new backup band, the Crown Jewels, and performed on the Canadian TV show, &quot;Where It&#x27;s At&quot;. Richard was also featured on the Monkees TV special &quot;33⅓ Revolutions per Monkee&quot; in April 1969. Williams booked Richard shows in Las Vegas casinos and resorts, leading Richard to adopt an even wilder, flamboyant, and androgynous look, inspired by Hendrix&#x27;s success. Richard was soon booked at rock festivals such as the Atlantic City Pop Festival where he stole the show from headliner Janis Joplin. Richard produced a similar show stealer at the Toronto Pop Festival with John Lennon as the headliner. These successes brought Little Richard to talk shows such as the &quot;Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and the &quot;Dick Cavett Show&quot;, raising his celebrity status.

Responding to his reputation as a successful concert performer, Reprise Records signed Richard in 1970 and he released the album, &quot;The Rill Thing&quot;, with the philosophical single, &quot;Freedom Blues&quot;, becoming his biggest single in years. In May 1970, Richard made the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. Despite the success of &quot;Freedom Blues&quot;, none of Richard&#x27;s other Reprise singles charted with the exception of &quot;Greenwood, Mississippi&quot;, a swamp rock original by guitar hero, Travis Wammack, who incidentally played on the track. It charted briefly on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, Cash Box pop chart, and &quot;Billboard&quot; Country charts. It made a strong showing on WWRL radio in New York. Richard became a featured guest instrumentalist and vocalist on recordings by acts such as Delaney and Bonnie, Joey Covington and Joe Walsh and was prominently featured on Canned Heat&#x27;s 1972 hit single, &quot;Rockin&#x27; with the King&quot;. To keep up with his finances and bookings, Richard and three of his brothers formed a management company, Bud Hole Incorporated. By 1972, Richard had entered the rock and roll revival circuit, and that year, he co-headlined the London Rock and Roll Show at Wembley Stadium with Chuck Berry. When he came on stage he announced himself &quot;the king of rock and roll&quot;, also the title of his 1971 album. He was booed during the show when he climbed on top of his piano and stopped singing; he also seemed to ignore the crowd. To make matters worse, he showed up with just five musicians and struggled through low lighting and bad microphones. When the concert film documenting the show came out, his performance was considered generally strong, though his fans noticed a drop in energy and vocal artistry. Two songs he performed did not make film&#x27;s final cut. The following year, he recorded a charting soul ballad, &quot;In the Middle of the Night&quot;, released with proceeds donated to victims of tornadoes that had caused damage in twelve states.

Richard did no new recordings in 1974, although two &quot;new&quot; albums were released. In the summer, came a major surprise for fans, &quot;Talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout Soul&quot;, a collection of previously released Vee Jay recordings, as well as some unreleased numbers, all never before available on a domestic LP. Two were new to the world: the title tune and &quot;You&#x27;d Better Stop&quot;, both up tempo.

Later that year came a set recorded in one night, early the previous year, called &quot;Right Now!&quot;, and featuring &quot;roots&quot; material, including a vocal version of an unreleased Reprise instrumental &quot;Mississippi&quot;, released in 1972 as &quot;Funky Dish Rag&quot;; his third try at his gospel-rock tune &quot;In the Name&quot;; and a 6-minute plus rocker, &quot;Hot Nuts&quot;, based upon a 1936 song by Li&#x27;l Johnson (&quot;Get &#x27;Em From The Peanut Man&quot;).

1975 was a big year for Richard, with a world tour and acclaim over high energy performances throughout England and France. His band was perhaps his best to date. He cut a top 40 single (US and Canada), with Bachman-Turner Overdrive, &quot;Take It Like a Man&quot;. He worked on new songs with sideman Seabrun &quot;Candy&quot; Hunter. In 1976, he decided to retire again, physically and mentally exhausted, having experienced family tragedy and the drug culture. He was talked into once again recutting his greatest hits, for Stan Shulman in Nashville. This time, they used original arrangements. Richard re-recorded eighteen of his hits for K-Tel Records in stereo, with a single featuring the new versions of &quot;Good Golly Miss Molly&quot; and &quot;Rip It Up&quot; reaching the UK singles chart. Richard later admitted that at the time he was addicted to drugs and alcohol.

By 1977, worn out from years of drug abuse and wild partying as well as a string of personal tragedies, Richard quit rock and roll again and returned to evangelism, releasing one gospel album, &quot;God&#x27;s Beautiful City&quot;, in 1979. At the same time, while touring as a minister and returning to talk shows, a controversial album was released by the discount label, Koala, taken from a 1974 concert. It includes an 11-minute discordant version of &quot;Good Golly, Miss Molly&quot;. The performances are widely panned as subpar and it gained notoriety among collectors.

===1984–1999: Comeback===

In 1984, Richard filed a $112 million lawsuit against Specialty Records, Art Rupe and his publishing company, Venice Music, and ATV Music for not paying royalties to him after he left the label in 1959. The suit was settled out of court in 1986. According to some reports, Michael Jackson allegedly gave him monetary compensation for his work, which he co-owned with Sony-ATV, songs by the Beatles and Richard. In September 1984, Charles White released the singer&#x27;s authorized biography, &quot;Quasar of Rock: The Life and Times of Little Richard&quot;, which returned Richard to the spotlight. Richard returned to show business in what &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; referred to as a &quot;formidable comeback&quot; following the book&#x27;s release.

Reconciling his roles as evangelist and rock and roller for the first time, Richard stated that the genre could be used for good or evil. After accepting a role in the film &quot;Down and Out in Beverly Hills&quot;, Richard and Billy Preston penned the faith-based rock and roll song &quot;Great Gosh A&#x27;Mighty&quot; for its soundtrack. Richard won critical acclaim for his film role and the song found success on the American and British charts. The hit led to the release of the album &quot;Lifetime Friend&quot; (1986) on Warner Bros. Records, with songs deemed &quot;messages in rhythm&quot;, including a gospel rap track. In addition to a version of &quot;Great Gosh A&#x27;Mighty&quot;, cut in England, the album featured two singles that charted in the UK, &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Comin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Operator&quot;. Richard spent much of the rest of the decade as a guest on television shows and appearing in films, winning new fans with what was referred to as his &quot;unique comedic timing.&quot;

In 1988, he introduced a new song written by his guitarist, Travis Wammack (&quot;King of the Swamp Guitar&quot;), &quot;(There&#x27;s ) No Place Like Home&quot;, a slow, reflective biographical Country ballad, which fans believed would become a major Country hit. It was performed at major musical events and captured on a commercial video from Italy and released in an Australian DVD. (Seven years later, a single was pressed but withdrawn. Richard discovered it was bootlegged.) That same year, he surprised fans with a tribute to Otis Redding at his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, singing several Redding songs, including &quot;Fa Fa Fa Fa Fa (Sad Song)&quot;, &quot;These Arms of Mine&quot;, and &quot;(Sittin&#x27; on the) Dock of the Bay&quot;. Richard told Redding&#x27;s story and explained how his 1956 tune &quot;All Around the World&quot; was Redding&#x27;s reference on his 1963 side, &quot;Hey, Hey Baby&quot;. In 1989, Richard provided rhythmic preaching and background vocals on the extended live version of the U2–B.B. King hit &quot;When Love Comes to Town&quot;. That same year, Richard returned to singing his classic hits following a performance of &quot;Lucille&quot; at an AIDS benefit concert.
In 1990, Richard contributed a spoken-word rap on Living Colour&#x27;s hit song, &quot;Elvis Is Dead&quot;, from their album &quot;Time&#x27;s Up&quot;. That same year he appeared in a cameo for the music video of Cinderella&#x27;s &quot;Shelter Me&quot;. In 1991, he appeared the home video &quot;Detonator Videoaction 1991&quot; by the hair metal band Ratt, and the same year, he was one of the featured performers on the hit single and video &quot;Voices That Care&quot; that was produced to boost the morale of U.S. troops involved in Operation Desert Storm. The same year, he recorded a version of &quot;The Itsy Bitsy Spider&quot; for the Pediatric AIDS Foundation benefit album &quot;For Our Children&quot;. The album&#x27;s success led to a deal with Walt Disney Records, resulting in the release of a hit 1992 children&#x27;s album, &quot;Shake It All About&quot;.

In 1994, Richard sang the theme song to the award-winning PBS Kids and TLC animated television series &quot;The Magic School Bus&quot;. He also opened Wrestlemania X from Madison Square Garden that year miming to his reworked rendition of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;.

Throughout the 1990s, Richard performed around the world and appeared on TV, film, and tracks with other artists, including Jon Bon Jovi, Elton John, and Solomon Burke. In 1992 he released his final album, &quot;Little Richard Meets Masayoshi Takanaka,&quot; featuring members of Richard&#x27;s touring band.

===2000–2020: Later years===
In 2000, Richard&#x27;s life was dramatized for the biographical film &quot;Little Richard&quot;, which focused on his early years, including his heyday, his religious conversion and his return to secular music in the early 1960s. Richard was played by Leon Robinson, who earned an NAACP Image Award nomination for his performance. In 2002, Richard contributed to the Johnny Cash tribute album, &quot;Kindred Spirits: A Tribute to the Songs of Johnny Cash&quot;. In 2004–2005, he released two sets of unreleased and rare cuts, from the Okeh label 1966/67 and the Reprise label in 1970/72. Included was the full &quot;Southern Child&quot; album, produced and composed mostly by Richard, scheduled for release in 1972, but shelved. In 2006, Little Richard was featured in a popular GEICO advertisement.
A 2005 recording of his duet vocals with Jerry Lee Lewis on a cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; was included on Lewis&#x27;s 2006 album, &quot;Last Man Standing&quot;. The same year, Richard was a guest judge on the TV series &quot;Celebrity Duets&quot;. Richard and Lewis performed alongside John Fogerty at the 2008 Grammy Awards in a tribute to the two artists considered to be cornerstones of rock and roll by the NARAS. That same year, Richard appeared on radio host Don Imus&#x27; benefit album for sick children, &quot;The Imus Ranch Record&quot;. In 2009, Richard was Inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame in a concert in New Orleans. In June 2010, Richard recorded a gospel track for an upcoming tribute album to songwriting legend Dottie Rambo.

Throughout the first decade of the new millennium, Richard kept up a vigorous touring schedule, performing primarily in the United States and Europe. However, sciatic nerve pain in his left leg and then replacement of the involved hip began affecting the frequency of his performances by 2010. Despite his health problems, Richard continued to perform to receptive audiences and critics. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reported that at a performance at the Howard Theater in Washington, D.C., in June 2012, Richard was &quot;still full of fire, still a master showman, his voice still loaded with deep gospel and raunchy power.&quot; Richard performed a full 90-minute show at the Pensacola Interstate Fair in Pensacola, Florida, in October 2012, at age 79, and headlined at the Orleans Hotel in Las Vegas during Viva Las Vegas Rockabilly Weekend in March 2013. In September 2013, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; published an interview with Richard who said that he would be retiring from performing. &quot;I am done, in a sense, because I don&#x27;t feel like doing anything right now&quot;, he told the magazine, adding, &quot;I think my legacy should be that when I started in showbusiness there wasn&#x27;t no such thing as rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll. When I started with &#x27;Tutti Frutti&#x27;, that&#x27;s when rock really started rocking.&quot; Richard would perform one last concert in Murfreesboro, Tennessee in 2014.

In June 2015, Richard appeared before a benefit concert audience, clad in sparkly boots and a brightly colored jacket at the Wildhorse Saloon in Nashville to receive the Rhapsody &amp; Rhythm Award from and raise funds for the National Museum of African American Music. It was reported that he charmed the crowd by reminiscing about his early days working in Nashville nightclubs. In May 2016, the National Museum of African American Music issued a press release indicating that Richard was one of the key artists and music industry leaders that attended its third annual Celebration of Legends Luncheon in Nashville honoring Shirley Caesar, Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff with Rhapsody &amp; Rhythm Awards. In 2016, a new CD was released on Hitman Records, &quot;California (I&#x27;m Comin&#x27;)&quot; with released and previously unreleased material from the 1970s, including an a cappella version of his 1975 single release, &quot;Try to Help Your Brother&quot;. On September 6, 2017, Richard participated in a television interview for the Christian Three Angels Broadcasting Network, appearing in a wheelchair, clean-shaven, without make-up, dressed in a blue paisley coat and tie, where he discussed his Christian faith.

On October 23, 2019, Richard addressed the audience after appearing to receive the Distinguished Artist Award at the 2019 Tennessee Governor&#x27;s Arts Awards at the Governor&#x27;s Residence in Nashville, Tennessee.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and family===
Around 1956, Richard became involved with Audrey Robinson, a sixteen-year-old college student, originally from Savannah, Georgia. Richard and Robinson quickly got acquainted even though Robinson was not a rock and roll fan. Richard said in his 1984 autobiography that he invited other men to have sexual encounters with her, including Buddy Holly. Robinson denied those statements. Robinson refused his marriage proposal. Robinson later became known under the name Lee Angel as a stripper and socialite. Richard reconnected with Robinson in the 1960s, though she left him again over his drug abuse. Robinson was interviewed for Richard&#x27;s 1985 documentary on &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; and denied Richard&#x27;s statements. According to Robinson, Richard would use her to buy food in white-only fast food stores that he could not enter due to his skin color.

Richard met his only wife, Ernestine Harvin, at an evangelical rally in October 1957. They began dating that year and wed on July 12, 1959, in Santa Barbara, California. According to Harvin, she and Richard initially enjoyed a happy marriage with &quot;normal&quot; sexual relations. When the marriage ended in divorce in April 1964, Harvin said it was due to her husband&#x27;s celebrity status, which had made life difficult for her. Richard said the marriage fell apart over his neglect and because of his sexuality. Both Robinson and Harvin denied Richard&#x27;s statements that he was gay, and Richard believed they did not know because he was &quot;such a pumper in those days&quot;. During the marriage, Richard and Harvin adopted a one-year-old boy, Danny Jones, from a late church associate. Richard and his son remained close, with Jones often acting as one of his bodyguards. Harvin later married Mcdonald Campbell.

===Sexuality===
In 1984, Richard said that he just played with girls as a child and was subjected to homosexual jokes and ridicule because of his manner of walking and talking. His father brutally punished him whenever he caught him wearing his mother&#x27;s makeup and clothing. The singer said he had been sexually involved with both sexes as a teenager. Because of his effeminate mannerisms, his father kicked him out of their family home when he was fifteen. In 1985, on &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;, Richard explained, &quot;my daddy put me out of the house. He said he wanted seven boys, and I had spoiled it, because I was gay.&quot;

Richard got involved in voyeurism in his early twenties. A female friend would drive him around picking up men who would allow him to watch them having sex in the backseat of cars. Richard&#x27;s activity caught the attention of Macon police in 1955 and he was arrested when caught in the act. Cited on a sexual misconduct charge, he spent three days in jail and was temporarily banned from performing in Macon.

In the early 1950s, Richard became acquainted with openly gay musician Billy Wright, who helped in establishing Richard&#x27;s look, advising him to use pancake makeup and wear his hair in a long-haired pompadour style similar to his. As Richard got used to the makeup, he ordered his band, the Upsetters, to wear makeup too, to gain entry into predominantly white venues. He later stated, &quot;I wore the make-up so that white men wouldn&#x27;t think I was after the white girls. It made things easier for me, plus it was colorful too.&quot; In 2000, Richard told &quot;Jet&quot; magazine, &quot;I figure if being called a sissy would make me famous, let them say what they want to.&quot; Richard&#x27;s look, however, still attracted female audiences, who would send him naked photos and their phone numbers.

During Richard&#x27;s heyday, his obsession with voyeurism and group sex continued, with Robinson&#x27;s participation. Richard wrote that Robinson would have sex with men while she sexually stimulated Richard. Despite saying he was &quot;born again&quot; after leaving rock and roll for the church in 1957, Richard left Oakwood College after exposing himself to a male student. The incident was reported to the student&#x27;s father, and Richard withdrew from the college. In 1962, Richard was arrested for spying on men urinating in toilets at a Trailways bus station in Long Beach, California. He participated in orgies and continued his voyeurism.

On May 4, 1982, on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, Richard said, &quot;God gave me the victory. I&#x27;m not gay now, but, you know, I was gay all my life. I believe I was one of the first gay people to come out. But God let me know that he made Adam be with Eve, not Steve. So, I gave my heart to Christ.&quot; In his 1984 book, while demeaning homosexuality as &quot;unnatural&quot; and &quot;contagious&quot;, he told Charles White he was &quot;omnisexual&quot;.

In 1995, Richard told &quot;Penthouse&quot; that he always knew he was gay, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve been gay all my life&quot;. In 2007, &quot;Mojo Magazine&quot; referred to Richard as &quot;bisexual&quot;.

In October 2017, Richard once again denounced homosexuality in an interview with the Christian Three Angels Broadcasting Network, calling homosexual and transgender identity &quot;unnatural affection&quot; that goes against &quot;the way God wants you to live&quot;.

===Drug use===
During his initial heyday in the 1950s rock and roll scene, Richard was a teetotaler abstaining from alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs. Richard often fined bandmates for drug and alcohol use during this era. By the mid-1960s, however, Richard began drinking heavily and smoking cigarettes and marijuana. By 1972, he had developed an addiction to cocaine. He later lamented that period, &quot;They should have called me Lil Cocaine, I was sniffing so much of that stuff!&quot; By 1975, he had developed addictions to both heroin and PCP, otherwise known as &quot;angel dust&quot;. His drug and alcohol use began to affect his career and personal life. &quot;I lost my reasoning&quot;, he later recalled.

Of his cocaine addiction, he said that he did whatever he could to use cocaine. Richard admitted that his addictions to cocaine, PCP and heroin were costing him as much as $1,000 a day. In 1977, longtime friend Larry Williams once showed up with a gun and threatened to kill him for failing to pay his drug debt. Richard said that this was the most fearful moment of his life; Williams&#x27; own drug addiction made him wildly unpredictable. Richard acknowledged that he and Williams were &quot;very close friends&quot; and when reminiscing of the drug-fueled clash, he recalled thinking &quot;I knew he loved me—I hoped he did!&quot; Within that same year, Richard had several devastating personal experiences, including his brother Tony&#x27;s death of a heart attack, the accidental shooting of his nephew whom he loved like a son, and the murder of two close personal friends – one a valet at &quot;the heroin man&#x27;s house.&quot; These experiences convinced the singer to give up drugs and alcohol, along with rock and roll, and return to the ministry.

===Religion===
Richard&#x27;s family had deep evangelical (Baptist and African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME)) Christian roots, including two uncles and a grandfather who were preachers. He also took part in Macon&#x27;s Pentecostal churches, which were his favorites mainly due to their music, charismatic praise, dancing in the Holy Spirit and speaking in tongues. At age ten, influenced by Pentecostalism, he went around saying he was a faith healer, singing gospel music to people who were feeling sick and touching them. He later recalled that they would often indicate that they felt better after he prayed for them and would sometimes give him money. Richard had aspirations to become a preacher due to the influence of singing evangelist Brother Joe May.

After he was born again in 1957, Richard enrolled at Oakwood College in Huntsville, Alabama, a mostly black Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) college, to study theology. He became a vegetarian, which coincided with his return to religion. He was ordained a minister in 1970 and resumed evangelical activities in 1977. Richard represented Memorial Bibles International and sold their Black Heritage Bible, which highlighted the Book&#x27;s many black characters. As a preacher, he evangelized in small churches and packed auditoriums of 20,000 or more. His preaching focused on uniting the races and bringing lost souls to repentance through God&#x27;s love. In 1984, Richard&#x27;s mother, Leva Mae, died following a period of illness. Prior to her death, Richard promised her that he would remain a Christian.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Richard officiated at celebrity weddings. In 2006, in one ceremony, Richard wedded twenty couples who won a contest. The musician used his experience and knowledge as a minister and elder statesman of rock and roll to preach at funerals of musical friends such as Wilson Pickett and Ike Turner. At a benefit concert in 2009 to raise funds to help rebuild children&#x27;s playgrounds that were destroyed by Hurricane Katrina, Richard asked guest of honor Fats Domino to pray with him and others. His assistants handed out inspirational booklets at the concert, a common practice at Richard&#x27;s shows. Richard told a Howard Theatre, Washington, D.C., audience in June 2012, &quot;I know this is not Church, but get close to the Lord. The world is getting close to the end. Get close to the Lord.&quot; In 2013, Richard elaborated on his spiritual philosophies, stating &quot;God talked to me the other night. He said He&#x27;s getting ready to come. The world&#x27;s getting ready to end and He&#x27;s coming, wrapped in flames of fire with a rainbow around his throne.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reported that his apocalyptic prophesies generated snickers from some audience members as well as cheers of support. Richard responded to the laughter by stating: &quot;When I talk to you about [Jesus], I&#x27;m not playing. I&#x27;m almost 81 years old. Without God, I wouldn&#x27;t be here.&quot;

In 1986, it was reported that Richard converted to Judaism at the encouragement of Bob Dylan—but &quot;Richard saw Judaism as not contradicting his other beliefs.&quot;

In 2017, Richard returned to his SDA spiritual roots and appeared in a televised interview on 3ABN and later he shared his personal testimony at 3ABN Fall Camp Meeting 2017.

===Health problems and death===
In October 1985, having finished &quot;Lifetime Friend&quot;, Richard returned from England to film a guest spot on the show &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. Following the taping, he crashed his sports car into a telephone pole in West Hollywood, California. He suffered a broken right leg, broken ribs and head and facial injuries. His recovery took several months, preventing him from attending the inaugural Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony in January 1986 where he was one of several inductees. He instead supplied a recorded message.

In 2007, Richard began having problems walking due to sciatica in his left leg, requiring him to use crutches. In November 2009, he entered a hospital to have replacement surgery on his left hip. Despite returning to performing the following year, Richard&#x27;s problems with his hip continued and he was brought onstage in a wheelchair, able to play only while seated. On September 30, 2013, he revealed to CeeLo Green at a Recording Academy fundraiser that he had suffered a heart attack the week before. Taking aspirin and having his son turn on the air conditioner saved his life according to his doctor. Richard stated, &quot;Jesus had something for me. He brought me through.&quot;

On April 28, 2016, Richard&#x27;s friend Bootsy Collins stated on his Facebook page that, &quot;he is not in the best of health so I ask all the Funkateers to lift him up.&quot; Reports stated that Richard was in grave health and that his family were gathering at his bedside. On May 3, 2016, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; provided a health update by Richard and his lawyer; Richard stated, &quot;not only is my family not gathering around me because I&#x27;m ill, but I&#x27;m still singing. I don&#x27;t perform like I used to, but I have my singing voice, I walk around, I had hip surgery a while ago but I&#x27;m healthy.&#x27;&quot; His lawyer said, &quot;He&#x27;s 83. I don&#x27;t know how many 83-year-olds still get up and rock it out every week, but in light of the rumors, I wanted to tell you that he&#x27;s vivacious and conversant about a ton of different things and he&#x27;s still very active in a daily routine.&quot; Though Richard continued to sing in his eighties, he kept away from the stage.

On May 9, 2020, after a two-month illness, Richard died at the age of 87 at a home in Tullahoma, Tennessee, from a cause related to bone cancer. His brother, sister, and son were with him. Richard received tributes from popular musicians, including Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, John Fogerty, Elton John, and Lenny Kravitz. He is interred at Oakwood University Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Huntsville, Alabama.

===Music===
Richard&#x27;s music and performance style had a pivotal effect on the sound and style of popular 20th century music genres. Richard embodied the rock and roll spirit more flamboyantly than any other performer. Richard&#x27;s raspy shouting style gave the genre one of its most identifiable and influential vocal sounds and his fusion of boogie-woogie, New Orleans R&amp;B and gospel music blazed its rhythmic trail. Richard&#x27;s emotive vocalizations and uptempo rhythmic music drove the formation of other popular music genres, including soul and funk. He influenced singers and musicians across musical genres from rock to hip hop; his music helped shape rhythm and blues for generations. Richard introduced several of rock music&#x27;s most characteristic musical features, including its high volume, vocal style emphasizing power, its distinctive beat, and innovative visceral rhythms. He departed from boogie-woogie&#x27;s shuffle rhythm and introduced a distinctive rock beat, where the beat division is even at all tempos. He reinforced this rhythm with a two-handed piano style, playing patterns with his right hand, with the rhythm typically popping out in the piano&#x27;s high register. His rhythm pattern, which he introduced with &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot; (1955), became the basis for the standard rock beat, which was later consolidated by Chuck Berry. &quot;Lucille&quot; (1957) foreshadowed the rhythmic feel of 1960s classic rock in several ways, including its heavy bassline, slower tempo, strong rock beat played by the entire band, and verse–chorus form similar to the blues.

Richard&#x27;s voice was able to generate croons, wails, and screams unprecedented in popular music. He was cited by two of soul music&#x27;s pioneers, Otis Redding and Sam Cooke, as contributing to the genre&#x27;s early development. Redding stated that most of his music was patterned after Richard&#x27;s, referring to his 1953 recording &quot;Directly From My Heart To You&quot; as the personification of soul, and that he had &quot;done a lot for [him] and [his] soul brothers in the music business.&quot; Cooke said in 1962 that Richard had done &quot;so much for our music&quot;. Cooke had a top 40 hit in 1963 with his cover of Richard&#x27;s 1956 hit &quot;Send Me Some Loving&quot;.

James Brown and others credited Richard and his mid-1950s backing band, The Upsetters, as the first to put funk in the rock beat.

Richard&#x27;s hits of the mid-1950s, such as &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot;, &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot;, &quot;Keep A-Knockin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Good Golly, Miss Molly&quot;, were generally characterized by playful lyrics with sexually suggestive connotations. AllMusic writer Richie Unterberger stated that Little Richard &quot;merged the fire of gospel with New Orleans R&amp;B, pounding the piano and wailing with gleeful abandon&quot;, and that while &quot;other R&amp;B greats of the early 1950s had been moving in a similar direction, none of them matched the sheer electricity of Richard&#x27;s vocals. With his high-speed deliveries, ecstatic trills, and the overjoyed force of personality in his singing, he was crucial in upping the voltage from high-powered R&amp;B into the similar, yet different, guise of rock and roll.&quot;

Emphasizing Richard&#x27;s folk influences, English professor W. T. Lhamon Jr. wrote, &quot;His songs were literally good booty. They were the repressed stuff of underground lore. And in Little Richard they found a vehicle prepared to bear their chocked energy, at least for his capsulated moment.&quot;

Ray Charles introduced him at a concert in 1988 as &quot;a man that started a kind of music that set the pace for a lot of what&#x27;s happening today.&quot; Richard&#x27;s contemporaries, including Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, Bill Haley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Pat Boone, the Everly Brothers, Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran, all recorded covers of his works. As they wrote about him for their Man of the Year – Legend category in 2010, &quot;GQ&quot; magazine stated that Richard &quot;is, without question, the boldest and most influential of the founding fathers of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll.&quot;

===Society===
In addition to his musical style, Richard was cited as one of the first black crossover artists, reaching audiences of all races. His music and concerts broke the color line, drawing mixed black and white audiences. As H.B. Barnum explained in &quot;Quasar of Rock&quot;, Little Richard &quot;opened the door. He brought the races together.&quot; Barnum described Richard&#x27;s music as not being &quot;boy-meets-girl-girl-meets-boy things, they were &quot;fun&quot; records, all fun. And they had a lot to say sociologically in our country and the world.&quot; Barnum also stated that Richard&#x27;s &quot;charisma was a whole new thing to the music business&quot;, explaining that &quot;he would burst onto the stage from anywhere, and you wouldn&#x27;t be able to hear anything but the roar of the audience. He might come out and walk on the piano. He might go out into the audience.&quot; Barnum stated that Richard was innovative in that he would wear colorful capes, blouse shirts, makeup and suits studded with multi-colored stones and sequins, and that he also brought flickering stage lighting from his show business experience into performance venues where rock and roll artists performed. In 2015, the National Museum of African American Music honored Richard for helping to shatter the color line on the music charts changing American culture forever.

Ian &quot;Lemmy&quot; Kilmister of the heavy metal band Motörhead spoke highly of him, stating: &quot;Little Richard was always my main man. How hard must it have been for him: gay, black and singing in the South? But his records are a joyous good time from beginning to end.&quot;

===Influence===

Richard influenced generations of performers. Quincy Jones stated that Richard was &quot;an innovator whose influence spans America&#x27;s musical diaspora from Gospel, the Blues &amp; R&amp;B, to Rock &amp; Roll, &amp; Hip-Hop.&quot; James Brown and Otis Redding both idolized him. Brown allegedly came up with the Famous Flames debut hit, &quot;Please, Please, Please&quot;, after Richard had written the words on a napkin. Redding started his professional career with Richard&#x27;s band, The Upsetters. and first entered a talent show performing Richard&#x27;s &quot;Heeby Jeebies&quot;, winning for fifteen consecutive weeks. Ike Turner claimed most of Tina Turner&#x27;s early vocal delivery was based on Richard, something Richard reiterated in the introduction of Turner&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Takin&#x27; Back My Name&quot;. Richard influenced Ritchie Valens; before he broke out, Valens was known as the &quot;Little Richard of San Fernando&quot;. Bob Dylan performed covers of Richard&#x27;s songs in high school with his rock and roll group, the Golden Chords; in his high school yearbook, under &quot;Ambition&quot;, he wrote: &quot;to join Little Richard&quot;.

The Beatles were heavily influenced by Richard. Paul McCartney idolized him in school and later used his recordings as inspiration for his uptempo rockers, such as &quot;I&#x27;m Down&quot;. &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; was the first song McCartney performed in public. McCartney later stated, &quot;I could do Little Richard&#x27;s voice, which is a wild, hoarse, screaming thing. It&#x27;s like an out-of-body experience. You have to leave your current sensibilities and go about a foot above your head to sing it.&quot; John Lennon recalled that upon hearing &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; in 1956, he was so impressed that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t speak&quot;. During the Beatles&#x27; Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, George Harrison commented, &quot;thank you all very much, especially the rock &#x27;n&#x27; rollers, an&#x27; Little Richard there, if it wasn&#x27;t for [gesturing to Little Richard], it was all his fault, really.&quot; Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones were also profoundly influenced by him, with Jagger citing him as his introduction to R&amp;B and calling him &quot;the originator and my first idol&quot;. Richard was the first rock n roll influence on Rod Stewart and Peter Wolf. Others influenced by Richard early on included Bob Seger and John Fogerty. Michael Jackson admitted that Richard had been a huge influence on him prior to the release of &quot;Off the Wall&quot;. Jimi Hendrix was influenced in appearance and sound by Richard. He was quoted in 1966 saying, &quot;I want to do with my guitar what Little Richard does with his voice.&quot;

Hard rock and heavy metal bands have cited Richard as an influence. John Kay of Steppenwolf recalls hearing &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot; on a U.S. Armed Forces station in East Prussia in the mid-1950s: &quot;it was unlike anything I ever heard before and it was instant &#x27;chicken skin time&#x27; - I mean goosebumps from head to toe. From that time on my focus was to hear as much of that stuff as possible, and after a while it became a kind of adolescent dream that someday [I] would be on the other side of the ocean, would learn how to speak English, and this music is something that I would play.&quot; Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin recalls: &quot;I was a 13-year-old boy in Kidderminster when I heard Little Richard for the first time. My parents shielded me from anything that was worldly. I spent my time searching feverishly through my stamp collection or working on my Meccano, and then someone played me &#x27;Good Golly, Miss Molly&#x27;. The sound! It was fantastic, indescribable.&quot; Jon Lord of Deep Purple said &quot;There would have been no Deep Purple if there had been no Little Richard.&quot; AC/DC&#x27;s early lead vocalist and co-songwriter Bon Scott idolized Richard and aspired to sing like him, its lead guitarist and co-songwriter Angus Young was first inspired to play guitar after listening to Richard, and rhythm guitarist and co-writer Malcolm Young derived his signature sound from playing his guitar like Richard&#x27;s piano. Motörhead was heavily influenced by Richard; Lemmy Kilmister said Richard should be &quot;Golden God&quot;.

Richard was an influence on glam rock. David Bowie called Richard his &quot;inspiration&quot;, recalling that upon hearing &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot; he &quot;heard God&quot;.
After opening for him with his band Bluesology, Elton John was inspired to be a &quot;rock and roll piano player&quot;. Lou Reed referred to Richard as his &quot;rock and roll hero&quot;, deriving inspiration from &quot;the soulful, primal force&quot; of the sound Richard and his saxophonist made on &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot;. Reed later stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t know why and I don&#x27;t care, but I wanted to go to wherever that sound was and make a life.&quot; Freddie Mercury performed covers of Richard&#x27;s songs as a teen, before finding fame with Queen.

The sexuality of Richard&#x27;s persona has been influential. Rock critics noted similarities between Prince&#x27;s androgynous look, music and vocal style and Richard&#x27;s. Patti Smith said, &quot;To me, Little Richard was a person that was able to focus a certain physical, anarchistic, and spiritual energy into a form which we call rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll ... I understood it as something that had to do with my future. When I was a little girl, Santa Claus didn&#x27;t turn me on. Easter Bunny didn&#x27;t turn me on. God turned me on. Little Richard turned me on.&quot;

Richard&#x27;s influence continues. Mystikal and André &quot;3000&quot; Benjamin were cited by critics as having emulated Richard&#x27;s style in their own works. Mystikal&#x27;s vocal delivery was compared to Richard&#x27;s. André 3000&#x27;s vocals in Outkast&#x27;s hit &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; were compared to an &quot;indie rock Little Richard&quot;. Bruno Mars declared that Richard was one of his and his performer-father&#x27;s early influences. Mars&#x27; song &quot;Runaway Baby&quot; was cited by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;channeling Little Richard&quot;. Chris Cornell of Audioslave and Soundgarden traced his musical influences back to Richard via the Beatles.

<text>Lloyd Price (March 9, 1933May 3, 2021) was an American R&amp;B and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll singer, known as &quot;Mr. Personality&quot;, after his 1959 million-selling hit, &quot;Personality&quot;. His first recording, &quot;Lawdy Miss Clawdy&quot;, was a hit for Specialty Records in 1952. He continued to release records, but none were as popular until several years later, when he refined the New Orleans beat and achieved a series of national hits. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.

== Early life, family and education ==
Price was born on March 9, 1933, in Kenner, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans, and raised in Kenner. His mother, Beatrice Price, owned the Fish &#x27;n&#x27; Fry Restaurant. Price picked up lifelong interests in business and food from her. He and his younger brother Leo were both musical.

He had formal training on trumpet and piano, sang in his church&#x27;s gospel choir, and was a member of a combo in high school.

== Career ==
Art Rupe, the owner of Specialty Records, based in Los Angeles, came to New Orleans in 1952 to record the distinctive style of rhythm and blues developing there, which had been highly successful for his competitor Imperial Records. Rupe heard Price&#x27;s song &quot;Lawdy Miss Clawdy&quot; and wanted to record it. Because Price did not have a band, Rupe hired Dave Bartholomew to create the arrangements and Bartholomew&#x27;s band (plus Fats Domino on piano) to back Price in the recording session. The song was a massive hit, selling over one million copies and earning Price his first gold disc. His next release, &quot;Oooh, Oooh, Oooh&quot;, cut at the same session, was a much smaller hit. Price continued making recordings for Specialty, but none of them reached the charts at that time.

In 1954, he was drafted into the US Army and sent to Korea. When he returned he found he had been replaced by Little Richard. In addition, his former chauffeur, Larry Williams, was also recording for the label, having released &quot;Short Fat Fannie&quot;.

He eventually formed KRC Records with Harold Logan and Bill Boskent. Their first single, &quot;Just Because&quot;, was picked up for distribution by ABC Records. From 1957 to 1959, Price recorded a series of national hits for ABC that successfully adapted the New Orleans sound, including &quot;Stagger Lee&quot; (which topped the Pop and R&amp;B charts and sold over a million copies), &quot;Personality&quot; (which reached number 2), and &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Get Married&quot; (number 3). When Price appeared on the television program &quot;American Bandstand&quot; to sing &quot;Stagger Lee&quot;, the producer and host of the program, Dick Clark, insisted that he alter the lyrics to tone down its violent content. &quot;Stagger Lee&quot; was Price&#x27;s version of an old blues standard, recorded many times previously by other artists. Greil Marcus, in a critical analysis of the song&#x27;s history, wrote that Price&#x27;s version was an enthusiastic rock rendition, &quot;all momentum, driven by a wailing sax.&quot; In all of these early recordings by Price (&quot;Personality&quot;, &quot;Stagger Lee&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Get Married&quot;, and others) Merritt Mel Dalton was the lead sax player; he was also in the traveling band and appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; with Price.
The personnel on the original hit recording of &quot;Stagger Lee&quot; included Clarence Johnson on piano, John Patton on bass, Charles McClendon and Eddie Saunders on tenor sax, Ted Curson on trumpet and Sticks Simpkins on drums.

In 1962, Price along with business partner Harold Logan formed Double L Records. Wilson Pickett got his start on this label. In 1967, Price and Logan acquired the site that had formerly been the fabled jazz club Birdland, at 1678 Broadway in New York City, and they opened a new club called The Turntable. In 1969, Logan was murdered in the office connected to the club. Price then founded a new label, Turntable.

During the 1970s, Price helped the boxing promoter Don King promote fights, including the &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot; boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in Kinshasa, Zaire and its accompanying concert which featured James Brown and B. B. King. He and Don King formed a record label, LPG, which issued Price&#x27;s last hit, &quot;What Did You Do With My Love&quot;, to limited success.

Price toured Europe in 1993 with Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, and Gary U.S. Bonds. He performed with soul legends Jerry Butler, Gene Chandler, and Ben E. King on the &quot;Four Kings of Rhythm and Blues&quot; tour in 2005; concerts were recorded for a DVD and a PBS television special.

Price appears in performance footage in the 2005 documentary film &quot;Make It Funky!&quot;, which presents a history of New Orleans music and its influence on rhythm and blues, rock and roll, funk and jazz. In the film, he performs &quot;Lawdy Miss Clawdy&quot; with Allen Toussaint and band.

On June 20, 2010, he appeared and sang in the season 1 finale of the HBO series &quot;Treme&quot;. he continued to sing.

=== Other pursuits ===
Price was a prolific entrepreneur. In addition to his music production and publication ownership, he started and owned businesses in various industries. He owned two construction companies, erecting middle-income housing in the 1980s in the Bronx and also homes in Staten Island.

He managed Global Icon Brands (a.k.a. Lloyd Price Icon Food Brands), which makes a line of Southern-style foods, including Lawdy Miss Clawdy food products, ranging from canned greens to sweet potato cookies, and a line of Lloyd Price foods, such as Lloyd Price&#x27;s Soulful &#x27;n&#x27; Smooth Grits and Lloyd Price&#x27;s Energy-2-Eat Bar, plus Lawdy Miss Clawdy clothing and collectibles.

In 2011, Price released his autobiography, &quot;The True King of the Fifties: The Lloyd Price Story&quot;, and worked on a Broadway musical, &quot;Lawdy Miss Clawdy&quot;, focused on his life and rise to stardom with a team that included the producer Phil Ramone. The musical also told how rock and roll evolved from the New Orleans music scene of the early 1950s. That musical evolved to become the 2023 production &quot;Personality: The Lloyd Price Musical&quot;, which opened at the Studebaker Theater in Chicago to positive reviews.

== Honors and awards ==

 The city of Kenner, Louisiana celebrates an annual Lloyd Price Day.

== Personal life and death ==

<doc id="147078" wikidata="Q804567" url="?curid=147078" title="Blue Cheer">
<text>Blue Cheer was an American rock band that initially performed and recorded in the late 1960s and early 1970s and was sporadically active until 2009. Based in San Francisco, Blue Cheer played in a psychedelic blues rock or acid rock style. They are also credited as being some of the earliest pioneers of heavy metal, with their cover of &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; sometimes cited as the first in the genre. They have also been noted as influential in the development of genres as disparate as punk rock, stoner rock, doom metal, experimental rock, and grunge.

==History==
===Main career (1966–1971)===
Blue Cheer were formed in 1966 by Dickie Peterson. Peterson had previously been with the Davis-based band the Oxford Circle along with future Blue Cheer members Paul Whaley and Gary Lee Yoder. The original Blue Cheer personnel were singer/bassist Peterson, guitarist Leigh Stephens and Eric Albronda as drummer. Albronda was later replaced by Whaley, who was joined by Peterson&#x27;s brother Jerre (guitar), Vale Hamanaka (keyboards), and Jere Whiting (vocals, harmonica). Albronda continued his association with Blue Cheer as a member of Blue Cheer management, as well as being the producer or co-producer of five Blue Cheer albums.

The band was managed by Allen &quot;Gut&quot; Terk, a former member of the Hells Angels. Early on, it was decided that the line-up should be trimmed down. It has been said that Blue Cheer decided to adopt a power trio configuration after seeing Jimi Hendrix perform at the Monterey Pop Festival. Hamanaka and Whiting were asked to leave. Jerre Peterson did not want to remain in the group without them, so he departed as well, leaving Peterson, Stephens and Whaley as a trio.

Their first hit was a cover version of Eddie Cochran&#x27;s &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; from their debut album &quot;Vincebus Eruptum&quot; (1968). The single peaked at No. 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, their only such hit, and the album peaked at No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. In Canada, the song peaked at No. 3 on the RPM Magazine chart.

The &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; single was backed with Dickie Peterson&#x27;s original song &quot;Out Of Focus&quot;. Peterson also contributed to the album the eight-minute &quot;Doctor Please&quot; and &quot;Second Time Around&quot;, which features Paul Whaley&#x27;s frantic drum solo. Filling out the record, the band cranked out blues covers &quot;Rock Me Baby&quot; (by B.B. King) and &quot;Parchman Farm&quot; (Mose Allison, but retitled &quot;Parchment Farm&quot;).

The group underwent several personnel changes, the first occurring after the 1968 release of &quot;Outsideinside&quot; after Leigh Stephens – who never used drugs – was asked to leave the band after criticizing his bandmates&#x27; behaviour. He was replaced by Randy Holden, formerly of Los Angeles garage rock band the Other Half. On 1969&#x27;s &quot;New! Improved!&quot; there were different guitarists on side 1 and side 2 (Randy Holden and Bruce Stephens) due to Holden&#x27;s unanticipated departure from the band. Following Holden&#x27;s departure the band&#x27;s line-up initially consisted of Dickie Peterson (bass), Tom Weisser (guitar), and Mitch Mitchell (drums), before Whaley returned and Bruce Stephens joined the band. Later, Ralph Burns Kellogg joined the band on keyboards. Blue Cheer&#x27;s style now changed to a more commercial hard rock sound à la Steppenwolf or Iron Butterfly. By the fourth album, &quot;Blue Cheer&quot;, Paul Whaley had left the band and had been replaced by Norman Mayell, and following the release of the fourth album Bruce Stephens also left the band and was succeeded by Gary Lee Yoder who helped complete the album.

According to Peterson, the group&#x27;s lifestyle during this period caused problems with the music industry and press. Peterson said the group was outraged by the Vietnam War and society in general.

The new line-up of Peterson, Kellogg, Mayell and Yoder in 1970 saw the release of &quot;The Original Human Being&quot;, followed by 1971&#x27;s &quot;Oh! Pleasant Hope&quot;. When the latter album failed to dent the sales charts, Blue Cheer temporarily split up in 1971.

===1974–1975 and 1978–1979 reunions===

In 1974, Blue Cheer reformed under the name “Peterbilt,” with Dickie Peterson and brother Jerre Peterson as founding members and three guitars in the band&#x27;s lineup. Peterbilt played club appearances in Sacramento January 10–12. By May of that year, they had switched the name back to &quot;Blue Cheer&quot; and the Petersons were co-writing new songs and slowly attracting more bookings. The band played an outdoor festival in San Juan Capistrano July 5.

In December 1974, Blue Cheer played a Christmas festival at The Greek Theatre in Los Angeles on December 22 alongside Van Halen, Judee Sill, The Coasters and Art Laboe&#x27;s Band, followed by a three-night run of appearances at The Whisky a Go Go from December 23 to December 25.

In 1975, Kim Fowley produced an album for Blue Cheer, with sometime Steppenwolf member Nick St. Nicholas co-producing. The lineup included the Peterson brothers on bass and guitar, along with ex-Hollywood Stars members Ruben De Fuentes on guitar and Terry Rae on drums. Although the album was never released, six tracks from this period were released on the Captain Trip Records album &quot;Live and Unreleased &#x27;68/&#x27;74&quot; (1996).

Dickie Peterson left the band in 1975 with Nick St. Nicholas replacing him on bass/vocals, leaving the band with no original members for some shows. The band played Laguna Beach Winter Festival February 15 of that year.

In 1978, Dickie Peterson began rehearsing with Davis-based guitarist Tony Rainier, a younger brother of Peterson&#x27;s high school friend (and sometime Blue Cheer soundman and bodyguard) Larry Rainier. Michael Fleck was auditioned as drummer. The reformed Blue Cheer recorded an album with Jim Keylor at Army Street Studios. The album was initially unreleased, but received an official release in 2012 by ShroomAngel Records as &quot;Blue Cheer 7.&quot; The band embarked on a US tour in 1978–1979 with setlists that featured tracks from the first two Blue Cheer albums, and then returned to a period of inactivity after the tour completed.

===Further reconfigurations, relocation to Germany, second and third extended hiatus (1980s–1998)===
Blue Cheer was once again inactive in the early 1980s. There was another attempt to reunite in 1983, but that fell through. In 1984, Peterson had better luck when he returned with Whaley and Rainier as Blue Cheer and a brand new album &quot;The Beast Is Back&quot;, which was released on the New York label Megaforce Records. Whaley left again in 1985 as drummer Brent Harknett took over, only to be succeeded by Billy Carmassi in 1987. That same year, Dickie led yet another new lineup of the Cheer that had Ruben De Fuentes back on guitar and Eric Davis on drums. In 1988, the line-up changed once again, being now composed of Dickie Peterson (bass), with Andrew &quot;Duck&quot; MacDonald (guitar) and Dave Salce (drums).

From 1989 to 1993, Blue Cheer toured mainly in Europe. During this time, they played with classic rock acts as well as then-up-and-coming bands: Mountain, Outlaws, Thunder, The Groundhogs, Ten Years After, Mucky Pup, Biohazard and others.

1989 saw the release of Blue Cheer&#x27;s first official live album, &quot;Blitzkrieg over Nüremberg&quot;. This album was recorded during Blue Cheer&#x27;s first European tour in decades.

1990 saw the release of the &quot;Highlights and Lowlives&quot; studio album, composed of blues-based heavy metal and one ballad. The album was co-produced by notable grunge producer Jack Endino and producer Roland Hofmann. The line-up was Peterson, Whaley on drums and MacDonald on guitars.

Blue Cheer followed up &quot;Highlights and Lowlives&quot; with the much heavier &quot;Dining with the Sharks&quot;. Duck MacDonald was replaced by German ex-Monsters guitar player Dieter Saller in 1990. Also featured is a special guest appearance by Groundhogs guitarist Tony McPhee. The album was co-produced by Roland Hofmann and Blue Cheer. Gary Holland (ex-Dokken/Great White/Britton replaced Whaley on drums in 1993.

In the early 1990s, Peterson and Whaley re-located to Germany. In 1992, Peterson recorded his first solo album, &quot;Child of the Darkness&quot;, in Cologne with a band named &quot;The Scrap Yard&quot;. The album appeared five years later in Japan on Captain Trip Records. After Peterson came back to the U.S. in 1994, Blue Cheer was dormant from 1994 to 1999.

===The return of Blue Cheer (1999–2009)===
In 1999, Peterson and Whaley got together with guitarist MacDonald to resume touring as Blue Cheer. This band configuration remained largely constant from 1999 until Peterson&#x27;s death in 2009.

In 2000, Blue Cheer was the subject of a tribute album, &quot;Blue Explosion – A Tribute to Blue Cheer&quot;, featuring such bands as Pentagram, Internal Void, Hogwash and Thumlock.

Peterson and Leigh Stephens were together once again in Blue Cheer with drummer Prairie Prince at the Chet Helms Memorial Tribal Stomp in San Francisco&#x27;s Golden Gate Park on October 29, 2005, and their lively performance drew old rockers like Paul Kantner and others from backstage to observe. They did some recordings in Virginia in Winter 2005 with Joe Hasselvander of Raven and Pentagram on drums, due to Paul Whaley choosing to remain in Germany. While Hasselvander played on the entire album, his contribution was reduced to drums on five songs, with Paul Whaley re-recording the drum parts on the balance of the album. This was because Whaley was set to rejoin the band and it was felt that he should contribute to the album, prior to touring. The resulting CD, &quot;What Doesn&#x27;t Kill You...&quot;, released in 2007, features contributions from both Whaley and Hasselvander as a consequence.

Blue Cheer&#x27;s video for &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; made an appearance in 2005 documentary &quot;&quot;, where Geddy Lee of Rush referred to the group as one of the first heavy metal bands.

===Death of Peterson and disbandment (2009)===
Peterson died on October 12, 2009, in Germany from prostate cancer. Peterson was actually 63 at the time of his death despite some initial confusion, as exemplified here, immediately following the announcement of his death. After Peterson&#x27;s death, long-time Blue Cheer guitarist Andrew MacDonald wrote on the group&#x27;s website that &quot;Blue Cheer is done. Out of respect for Dickie, Blue Cheer [will] never become a viable touring band again.&quot; Drummer Paul Whaley died of heart failure in January 2019.

===Dispute over ownership of band name===
In recent years, a dispute has arisen as to ownership of the Blue Cheer band name. It was reported that, as of the early 2000s (decade), former Blue Cheer guitarist Randy Holden, assisted by Randy Pratt of The Lizards band, had trademarked the Blue Cheer band name. Holden&#x27;s association with Blue Cheer was quite brief; his only recorded output with the band is three tracks on &quot;New! Improved!&quot; from 1969. The matter had upset Dickie Peterson, given his position as a co-founder of the band and the only continuing member since its inception, but does not appear to have been resolved.

According to Randy Pratt, this report is not entirely accurate. Pratt provides uncited commentary as follows:

== Legacy ==
Blue Cheer is often credited as one of the very earliest pioneers of heavy metal and their version of &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; has been cited as the first heavy metal song.
According to Tim Hills in his book, &quot;The Many Lives of the Crystal Ballroom&quot;, &quot;Blue Cheer was the epitome of San Francisco psychedelia.&quot; Jim Morrison of The Doors characterized the group as &quot;the single most powerful band I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot; and Eric Clapton defined them as &quot;probably the originators of heavy metal&quot;. Blue Cheer influenced such late 1970s bands as East-European psychedelic hardcore band Galloping Coroners.

Blue Cheer was also widely recognized as the loudest band ever at the time when they emerged. Billy Altman reported that at a 1968 concert the band was &quot;So loud, in fact, that within just a few songs, much of the crowd in the front orchestra section was fleeing.&quot;

Various artists in the grunge movement have paid homage to Blue Cheer, including Melvins vocalist Buzz Osborne and Mudhoney vocalist Mark Arm, who said; &quot;Hearing Blue Cheer [while in college] was almost as important to me as hearing the Stooges for the first time the year before. When Mudhoney started up, Blue Cheer was definitely part of our blueprint.”

&quot;Blue Cheer&quot; was the name of a variety of LSD made by chemist and Grateful Dead patron Owsley Stanley and the band was probably named after that, although the name existed earlier, as the name of a laundry detergent after which the LSD variety itself was named.

<text>John Rogers Searle (American English pronunciation: ; born July 31, 1932) is an American philosopher widely noted for contributions to the philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, and social philosophy. He began teaching at UC Berkeley in 1959, and was Willis S. and Marion Slusser Professor Emeritus of the Philosophy of Mind and Language and Professor of the Graduate School at the University of California, Berkeley, until June 2019, when his status as professor emeritus was revoked because he was found to have violated the university&#x27;s sexual harassment policies.

As an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Searle was secretary of &quot;Students against Joseph McCarthy&quot;. He received all his university degrees, BA, MA, and DPhil, from the University of Oxford, where he held his first faculty positions. Later, at UC Berkeley, he became the first tenured professor to join the 1964–1965 Free Speech Movement. In the late 1980s, Searle challenged the restrictions of Berkeley&#x27;s 1980 rent stabilization ordinance. Following what came to be known as the California Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Searle Decision&quot; of 1990, Berkeley changed its rent control policy, leading to large rent increases between 1991 and 1994.

In 2000, Searle received the Jean Nicod Prize; in 2004, the National Humanities Medal; and in 2006, the Mind &amp; Brain Prize. In 2010 he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. Searle&#x27;s early work on speech acts, influenced by J. L. Austin and Ludwig Wittgenstein, helped establish his reputation. His notable concepts include the &quot;Chinese room&quot; argument against &quot;strong&quot; artificial intelligence.

==Biography==

Searle&#x27;s father, G.W. Searle, an electrical engineer, was employed by AT&amp;T Corporation; his mother, Hester Beck Searle, was a physician.

Searle began his college education at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. In his junior year, he became a Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford, where he obtained all his university degrees, BA, MA, and DPhil.

Searle was the Willis S. and Marion Slusser Professor Emeritus of the Philosophy of Mind and Language and Professor of the Graduate School at the University of California, Berkeley; even though he retired in 2014, he continued teaching until 2016. In June 2019, the emeritus title was revoked.

===Politics===
While an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Searle became the secretary of &quot;Students against Joseph McCarthy&quot;. McCarthy at that time served as the junior senator from Wisconsin. In 1959, Searle began teaching at Berkeley, and he was the first tenured professor to join the 1964–65 Free Speech Movement. In 1969, while serving as chairman of the Academic Freedom Committee of the Academic Senate of the University of California, he supported the university in its dispute with students over the People&#x27;s Park.

In &quot;The Campus War: A Sympathetic Look at the University in Agony&quot; (1971), Searle investigates the causes behind the campus protests of the era. In it he declares, &quot;I have been attacked by both the House Un-American Activities Committee and...several radical polemicists... Stylistically, the attacks are interestingly similar. Both rely heavily on insinuation and innuendo, and both display a hatred --one might almost say terror-- of close analysis and dissection of argument.&quot; He asserts that &quot;My wife was threatened that I (and other members of the administration) would be assassinated or violently attacked.&quot;

In the late 1980s, Searle, along with other landlords, petitioned Berkeley&#x27;s rental board to raise the limits on how much he could charge tenants under the city&#x27;s 1980 rent-stabilization ordinance. The rental board refused to consider Searle&#x27;s petition and Searle filed suit, charging a violation of due process. In 1990, in what came to be known as the &quot;Searle Decision&quot;, the California Supreme Court upheld Searle&#x27;s argument in part and Berkeley changed its rent-control policy, leading to large rent-increases between 1991 and 1994. Searle was reported to see the issue as one of fundamental rights, being quoted as saying &quot;The treatment of landlords in Berkeley is comparable to the treatment of blacks in the South... our rights have been massively violated and we are here to correct that injustice.&quot; The court described the debate as a &quot;morass of political invective, ad hominem attack, and policy argument&quot;.

Shortly after the September 11 attacks, Searle wrote an article arguing that the attacks were a particular event in a long-term struggle against forces that are intractably opposed to the United States, and signaled support for a more aggressive neoconservative interventionist foreign policy. He called for the realization that the United States is in a more-or-less permanent state of war with these forces. Moreover, a probable course of action would be to deny terrorists the use of foreign territory from which to stage their attacks. Finally, he alluded to the long-term nature of the conflict and blamed the attacks on the lack of American resolve to deal forcefully with America&#x27;s enemies over the past several decades.

===Sexual assault allegations===
In March 2017, Searle became the subject of sexual assault allegations. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported: &quot;A new lawsuit alleges that university officials failed to properly respond to complaints that John Searle ... sexually assaulted his ... research associate last July and cut her pay when she rejected his advances.&quot; The case brought to light several earlier complaints against Searle, on which Berkeley allegedly had failed to act.

The lawsuit, filed in a California court on March 21, 2017, alleged sexual harassment, retaliation, wrongful termination and assault and battery and sought damages both from Searle and from the Regents of the University of California as his employers. It also claims that Jennifer Hudin, the director of the John Searle Center for Social Ontology, where the complainant had been employed as an assistant to Searle, has stated that Searle &quot;has had sexual relationships with his students and others in the past in exchange for academic, monetary or other benefits&quot;. After news of the lawsuit became public, several previous allegations of sexual harassment and assault by Searle were also revealed.

On June 19, 2019, following campus disciplinary proceedings by Berkeley&#x27;s Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination (OPHD), University of California President Janet Napolitano approved a recommendation that Searle have his emeritus status revoked, after a determination that he had violated university policies against sexual harassment and retaliation between July and September 2016.

===Awards and recognitions===
Searle has five honorary-doctorate degrees from four countries and is an honorary visiting professor at Tsing Hua University and at East China Normal University.

In 2000, Searle received the Jean Nicod Prize; in 2004, the National Humanities Medal; and in 2006, the Mind &amp; Brain Prize.

==Philosophical work==

===Speech acts===
Searle&#x27;s early work, which did much to establish his reputation, was on speech acts. He attempted to synthesize ideas from many colleagues – including J.L. Austin (the &quot;illocutionary act&quot;, from &quot;How To Do Things with Words&quot;), Ludwig Wittgenstein and G.C.J. Midgley (the distinction between regulative and constitutive rules) – with his own thesis that such acts are constituted by the rules of language. He also drew on the work of Paul Grice (the analysis of meaning as an attempt at being understood), Hare and Stenius (the distinction, concerning meaning, between illocutionary force and propositional content), P.F. Strawson, John Rawls and William Alston, who maintained that sentence meaning consists in sets of regulative rules requiring the speaker to perform the illocutionary act indicated by the sentence and that such acts involve the utterance of a sentence which (a) indicates that one performs the act; (b) means what one says; and (c) addresses an audience in the vicinity.

In his 1969 book &quot;Speech Acts&quot;, Searle sets out to combine all these elements to give his account of illocutionary acts. There he provides an analysis of what he considers the prototypical illocutionary act of promising and offers sets of semantical rules intended to represent the linguistic meaning of devices indicating further illocutionary act types. Among concepts presented in the book is the distinction between the &quot;illocutionary force&quot; and the &quot;propositional content&quot; of an utterance. Searle does not precisely define the former as such, but rather introduces several possible illocutionary forces by example. According to Searle, the sentences...
# Sam smokes habitually.
# Does Sam smoke habitually?
# Sam, smoke habitually!
# Would that Sam smoked habitually!

... each indicate the same propositional content (Sam smoking habitually) but differ in the illocutionary force indicated (respectively, a statement, a question, a command and an expression of desire).

According to a later account, which Searle presents in &quot;Intentionality&quot; (1983) and which differs in important ways from the one suggested in &quot;Speech Acts&quot;, illocutionary acts are characterised by having &quot;conditions of satisfaction&quot;, an idea adopted from Strawson&#x27;s 1971 paper &quot;Meaning and Truth&quot;, and a &quot;direction of fit&quot;, an idea adopted from Austin and Elizabeth Anscombe. For example, the statement &quot;John bought two candy bars&quot; is satisfied if and only if it is true, i.e., John did buy two candy bars. By contrast, the command &quot;John, buy two candy bars!&quot; is satisfied if and only if John carries out the action of purchasing two candy bars. Searle refers to the first as having the &quot;word-to-world&quot; direction of fit, since the words are supposed to change to accurately represent the world, and the second as having the &quot;world-to-word&quot; direction of fit, since the world is supposed to change to match the words. There is also the double direction of fit, in which the relationship goes both ways, and the null or zero direction of fit, in which it goes neither way because the propositional content is presupposed, as in &quot;I am sorry I ate John&#x27;s candy bars.&quot;

In &quot;Foundations of Illocutionary Logic&quot; (1985, with Daniel Vanderveken), Searle prominently uses the notion of the &quot;illocutionary point&quot;.

Searle&#x27;s speech-act theory has been challenged by several thinkers in various ways. Collections of articles referring to Searle&#x27;s account are found in Burkhardt 1990 and Lepore / van Gulick 1991.

===Intentionality and the background===
In &quot;Intentionality: An Essay in the Philosophy of Mind&quot; (1983), Searle applies the principles of his account(s) of illocutionary acts to the investigation of intentionality, which is central to Searle&#x27;s &quot;Philosophy of Mind&quot;. (Searle is at pains to emphasize that &#x27;intentionality&#x27;, the capacity of mental states to be &quot;about&quot; worldly objects, is not to be confused with &#x27;intensionality&#x27;, the referential opacity of contexts that fail tests for &#x27;extensionality&#x27;.)

For Searle, intentionality is exclusively mental, being the power of minds to represent or symbolize over, things, properties and states of affairs in the external world. Causal covariance, about-ness and the like are not enough: maps, for instance, only have a &#x27;derived&#x27; intentionality, a mere after-image of the real thing.

Searle also introduces a technical term &quot;the Background&quot;, which, according to him, has been the source of much philosophical discussion (&quot;though I have been arguing for this thesis for almost twenty years,&quot; Searle writes, &quot;many people whose opinions I respect still disagree with me about it&quot;). He calls &quot;Background&quot; the set of abilities, capacities, tendencies, and dispositions that humans have that are not themselves intentional states but that generate appropriate such states on demand.

Thus, when someone is asked to &quot;cut the cake,&quot; they know to use a knife and when someone is asked to &quot;cut the grass,&quot; they know to use a lawnmower (and not vice versa), even though the request did not mention this. Beginning with the possibility of reversing these two, an endless series of sceptical, anti-real or science-fiction interpretations could be imagined. &quot;I wish to say that there is a &quot;radical&quot; underdetermination of what is said by the literal meaning...&quot; emphasizes Searle. The Background fills the gap, being the capacity always to have a suitable interpretation to hand. &quot;I just take a huge metaphysics for granted,&quot; he says. Searle sometimes supplements his reference to the &quot;Background&quot; with the concept of &quot;the Network&quot;, one&#x27;s network of other beliefs, desires, and other intentional states necessary for any particular intentional state to make sense.

To give an example, two chess players might be engaged in a bitter struggle at the board, but they share all sorts of Background presuppositions: that they will take turns to move, that no one else will intervene, that they are both playing to the same rules, that the fire alarm will not go off, that the board will not suddenly disintegrate, that their opponent will not magically turn into a grapefruit, and so on indefinitely. As most of these possibilities will not have occurred to either player, Searle thinks the Background is itself unconscious as well as nonintentional. To have a Background is to have a set of brain structures that generate appropriate intentional states (if the fire alarm does go off, say). &quot;Those brain structures enable me to activate the system of intentionality and to make it function, but the capacities realized in the brain structures do not themselves consist in intentional states.&quot;

It seems to Searle that Hume and Nietzsche were probably the first philosophers to appreciate, respectively, the centrality and radical contingency of the Background. &quot;Nietzsche saw, with anxiety, that the Background does not have to be the way it is.&quot; Searle also thinks that a Background appears in the ideas of other modern thinkers: as the river-bed/substratum of Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;On Certainty&quot; (&quot;the work of the later Wittgenstein is in large part about the Background, especially &quot;On Certainty&quot;&quot;) and Pierre Bourdieu&#x27;s &quot;habitus&quot;.

In his debate with Jacques Derrida, Searle argued against Derrida&#x27;s purported view that a statement can be disjoined from the original intentionality of its author, for example when no longer connected to the original author, while still being able to produce meaning. Searle maintained that even if one was to see a written statement with no knowledge of authorship it would still be impossible to escape the question of intentionality, because &quot;a meaningful sentence is just a standing possibility of the (intentional) speech act&quot;. For Searle, ascribing intentionality to a statement was a basic requirement for attributing it any meaning at all.

In 2023 Pierre Jacob described Searle&#x27;s view as &quot;anti-intentionalist&quot;.

===Consciousness===
Building upon his views about intentionality, Searle presents a view concerning consciousness in his book &quot;The Rediscovery of the Mind&quot; (1992). He argues that, starting with behaviorism, an early but influential scientific view, succeeded by many later accounts that Searle also dismisses, much of modern philosophy has tried to deny the existence of consciousness, with little success. In &quot;Intentionality&quot;, he parodies several alternative theories of consciousness by replacing their accounts of intentionality with comparable accounts of the hand:

:No one would think of saying, for example, &quot;Having a hand is just being disposed to certain sorts of behavior such as grasping&quot; (manual behaviorism), or &quot;Hands can be defined entirely in terms of their causes and effects&quot; (manual functionalism), or &quot;For a system to have a hand is just for it to be in a certain computer state with the right sorts of inputs and outputs&quot; (manual Turing machine functionalism), or &quot;Saying that a system has hands is just adopting a certain stance toward it&quot; (the manual stance) (p. 263).

Searle argues that philosophy has been trapped by a false dichotomy: that, on one hand, the world consists of nothing but objective particles in fields of force, but that yet, on the other hand, consciousness is clearly a subjective first-person experience.

Searle says simply that both are true: consciousness is a real subjective experience, caused by the physical processes of the brain. (A view which he suggests might be called &quot;biological naturalism&quot;.)

====Ontological subjectivity====
Searle has argued that critics like Daniel Dennett, who he claims insist that discussing subjectivity is unscientific because science presupposes objectivity, are making a category error. Perhaps the goal of science is to establish and validate statements which are &quot;epistemically&quot; objective, i.e., whose truth can be discovered and evaluated by any interested party, but are not necessarily &quot;ontologically&quot; objective.

Searle calls any value judgment epistemically &quot;subjective&quot;. Thus, &quot;McKinley is prettier than Everest&quot; is &quot;epistemically subjective&quot;, whereas &quot;McKinley is higher than Everest&quot; is &quot;epistemically objective&quot;. In other words, the latter statement is evaluable, in fact, falsifiable, by an understood (&#x27;background&#x27;) criterion for mountain height, like &quot;the summit is so many meters above sea level&quot;. No such criteria exist for prettiness.

Beyond this distinction, Searle thinks there are certain phenomena, including all conscious experiences, that are &quot;ontologically&quot; subjective, i.e., can only exist as subjective experience. For example, although it might be subjective or objective in the epistemic sense, a doctor&#x27;s note that a patient suffers from back pain is an epistemically &quot;objective&quot; claim: it counts as a medical diagnosis only because the existence of back pain is &quot;an objective fact of medical science&quot;. The pain itself, however, is &quot;ontologically subjective&quot;: it is only experienced by the person having it.

Searle goes on to affirm that &quot;where consciousness is concerned, the existence of the appearance &quot;is&quot; the reality&quot;. His view that the epistemic and ontological senses of objective/subjective are cleanly separable is crucial to his self-proclaimed biological naturalism, because it allows epistemically objective judgments like &quot;That object is a pocket calculator&quot; to pick out agent-relative features of objects, and such features are, on his terms, ontologically subjective, unlike, say, &quot;That object is made mostly of plastic&quot;.

====Artificial intelligence====

Biological naturalism implies that if humans want to create a conscious being, they will have to duplicate whatever physical processes the brain goes through to cause consciousness. Searle thereby means to contradict what he calls &quot;Strong AI&quot;, defined by the assumption that &quot;the appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to &quot;understand&quot; and have other cognitive states.&quot;

In 1980, Searle presented the &quot;Chinese room&quot; argument, which purports to prove the falsity of strong AI. A person is in a room with two slits, and they have a book and some scratch paper. This person does not know any Chinese. Someone outside the room slides some Chinese characters in through the first slit; the person in the room follows the instructions in the book, transcribing the characters as instructed onto the scratch paper, and slides the resulting sheet out by the second slit. To people outside the room, it appears that the room speaks Chinese – they have slid Chinese statements into one slit and got valid responses in English – yet the &#x27;room&#x27; does not understand a word of Chinese. This suggests, according to Searle, that no computer can ever understand Chinese or English, because, as the thought experiment suggests, being able to &#x27;translate&#x27; Chinese into English does not entail &#x27;understanding&#x27; either Chinese or English: all that the person in the thought experiment, and hence a computer, is able to do is to execute certain syntactic manipulations. Douglas Hofstadter and Daniel Dennett in their book &quot;The Mind&#x27;s I&quot; criticize Searle&#x27;s view of AI, particularly the Chinese room argument.

Stevan Harnad argues that Searle&#x27;s &quot;Strong AI&quot; is really just another name for functionalism and computationalism, and that these positions are the real targets of his critique. Functionalists argue that consciousness can be defined as a set of informational processes inside the brain. It follows that anything that carries out the same informational processes as a human is also conscious. Thus, if humans wrote a computer program that was conscious, they could run that computer program on, say, a system of ping-pong balls and beer cups and the system would be equally conscious, because it was running the same information processes.

Searle argues that this is impossible, contending that consciousness is a physical property, like digestion or fire. No matter how good a simulation of digestion is built on the computer, it will not digest anything; no matter how well it simulates fire, nothing will get burnt. By contrast, informational processes are &quot;observer-relative&quot;: observers pick out certain patterns in the world and consider them information processes, but information processes are not things-in-the-world themselves. Since they do not exist at a physical level, Searle argues, they cannot have &quot;causal efficacy&quot; and thus cannot cause consciousness. There is no physical law, Searle insists, that can see the equivalence between a personal computer, a series of ping-pong balls and beer cans, and a pipe-and-water system all implementing the same program.

===Social reality===
Searle extended his inquiries into observer-relative phenomena by trying to understand social reality. Searle begins by arguing collective intentionality (e.g., &quot;we are going for a walk&quot;) is a distinct form of intentionality, not simply reducible to individual intentionality (e.g., &quot;I am going for a walk with him and I think he thinks he is going for a walk with me and he thinks I think I am going for a walk with him and...&quot;)

In &quot;The Construction of Social Reality&quot; (1995), Searle addresses the mystery of how social constructs like &quot;baseball&quot; or &quot;money&quot; can exist in a world consisting only of physical particles in fields of force. Adapting an idea by Elizabeth Anscombe in &quot;On Brute Facts&quot;, Searle distinguishes between &quot;brute facts&quot;, like the height of a mountain, and &quot;institutional facts&quot;, like the score of a baseball game. Aiming at an explanation of social phenomena in terms of Anscombe&#x27;s notion, he argues that society can be explained in terms of institutional facts, and institutional facts arise out of collective intentionality through constitutive rules with the logical form &quot;X counts as Y in C&quot;. Thus, for instance, filling out a ballot counts as a vote in a polling place, getting so many votes counts as a victory in an election, getting a victory counts as being elected president in the presidential race, etc.

Many sociologists, however, do not see Searle&#x27;s contributions to social theory as very significant. Neil Gross, for example, argues that Searle&#x27;s views on society are more or less a reconstitution of the sociologist Émile Durkheim&#x27;s theories of social facts, social institutions, collective representations, and the like. Searle&#x27;s ideas are thus open to the same criticisms as Durkheim&#x27;s. Searle responded that Durkheim&#x27;s work was worse than he had originally believed and, admitting he had not read much of Durkheim&#x27;s work, said: &quot;Because Durkheim&#x27;s account seemed so impoverished I did not read any further in his work.&quot; Steven Lukes, however, responded to Searle&#x27;s response to Gross and argued point by point against the allegations that Searle makes against Durkheim, essentially upholding Gross&#x27;s argument that Searle&#x27;s work bears a great resemblance to Durkheim&#x27;s. Lukes attributes Searle&#x27;s miscomprehension of Durkheim&#x27;s work to the fact that Searle had never read Durkheim.

====Searle–Lawson debate====

In recent years, Searle&#x27;s main interlocutor on issues of social ontology has been Tony Lawson. Although their accounts of social reality are similar, there are important differences. Lawson emphasizes the notion of social totality whereas Searle prefers to refer to institutional facts. Furthermore, Searle believes that emergence implies causal reduction whereas Lawson argues that social totalities cannot be completely explained by the causal powers of their components. Searle also places language at the foundation of the construction of social reality, while Lawson believes that community formation necessarily precedes the development of language and, therefore, there must be the possibility for non-linguistic social structure formation. The debate is ongoing and takes place additionally through regular meetings of the Centre for Social Ontology at the University of California, Berkeley and the Cambridge Social Ontology Group at the University of Cambridge.

===Rationality===
In &quot;Rationality in Action&quot; (2001), Searle argues that standard notions of rationality are badly flawed. According to what he calls the Classical Model, rationality is seen as something like a train track: a person moves onto it at one point with their beliefs and desires, and then the rules of rationality compel them all the way to a conclusion. Searle doubts that this picture of rationality holds generally.

Searle briefly critiques one particular set of these rules: those of mathematical decision theory. He points out that its axioms require that anyone who valued a quarter and their life would, at some odds, bet their life for a quarter. Searle insists he would never take such a bet and believes that this stance is perfectly rational.

Most of his attack is directed against the common conception of rationality, which he believes is badly flawed. First, he argues that reason does not cause an individual to do anything, because having sufficient reason &quot;wills&quot;, but does not &quot;force&quot;, them to do that thing. Therefore, in any decision situation, people experience a gap between reasons and actions. For example, when a person decides to vote, they may determine that they care most about economic policy and that they prefer candidate Jones&#x27;s economic policy, but they must also make an effort to actually cast a vote. Similarly, every time a smoker who feels guilty about their action lights a cigarette, they are aware that they are succumbing to their craving, and not merely acting automatically as they do when they exhale. This gap makes people think they have &quot;freedom of the will&quot;. Searle thinks that whether one really has free will or not is an open question, but considers its absence highly unappealing because it makes the feeling of freedom of will an epiphenomenon, which is highly unlikely from the evolutionary point of view given its biological cost. He also says, &quot;All rational activity presupposes free will&quot;.
Second, Searle believes that people can rationally do things that do not result from their own desires. It is widely believed that one cannot derive an &quot;ought&quot; from an &quot;is&quot;, i.e., that facts about how the world is can never tell a person what they should do (Hume&#x27;s Law). By contrast, insofar as a fact is understood to relate to an institution (marriage, promises, commitments, etc.), which is to be understood as a system of constitutive rules, then what one should do can be understood as following from the institutional fact of what one has done; institutional fact, then, can be understood as opposed to the &quot;brute facts&quot; related to Hume&#x27;s Law. For example, Searle believes that the promise of doing something means that one must do it, because by making the promise one participates in the constitutive rules that arrange the system of promise-making itself; a &quot;shouldness&quot; is implicit in the mere factual action of promising. Furthermore, he believes that this provides a desire-independent reason for an action – if one orders a drink at a bar, there is an obligation to pay for it even if one has no desire to do so. This argument, which he first made in his paper, &quot;How to Derive &#x27;Ought&#x27; from &#x27;Is&#x27;&quot; (1964), remains highly controversial, but Searle maintained that &quot;the traditional metaphysical distinction between fact and value cannot be captured by the linguistic distinction between &#x27;evaluative&#x27; and &#x27;descriptive&#x27; because all such speech act notions are already normative&quot;.

Third, Searle argues that much of rational deliberation involves adjusting patterns of desires, which are often inconsistent, to decide between outcomes, not the other way around. While in the Classical Model one would start from viewing a desire to go to Paris as a greater factor than saving money, which would lead to calculating the cheapest way to get there, Searle would argue that people balance the desire of Paris against the desire to save money to determine which one they value more. Hence, he believes that rationality is not a system of rules, but more of an adverb. Certain behaviors are seen as rational, no matter what their source, and a system of rules derives from finding patterns in what is considered rational.

===Searle–Derrida debate===

After Jacques Derrida, in his 1972 paper &quot;Signature Event Context,&quot; responded to J. L. Austin&#x27;s theory of the illocutionary act, Searle argued, in his 1977 essay &quot;Reiterating the Differences: A Reply to Derrida,&quot; that Derrida&#x27;s apparent rejection of Austin was unwarranted. Searle later refused to let his 1977 reply to be printed along with Derrida&#x27;s papers in the 1988 collection &quot;Limited Inc&quot; — in which a new text by Derrida attacked Searle&#x27;s positions on the topic. In the 1990s, Searle elaborated on why he did not consider Derrida&#x27;s approach to be legitimate philosophy.

A so far insuperable stumbling block to artificial intelligence is an incapacity for reliable disambiguation. &quot;[V]irtually every sentence [that people generate] is ambiguous, often in multiple ways.&quot; A prominent example is known as the &quot;pronoun disambiguation problem&quot;: a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a pronoun in a sentence—such as &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot; or &quot;it&quot;—refers.

<text>Nathan Mironovich Milstein ( – December 21, 1992) was a Russian and American virtuoso violinist.

Widely considered one of the finest violinists of the 20th century, Milstein was known for his interpretations of Bach&#x27;s solo violin works and for works from the Romantic period. He was also known for his long career: he performed at a high level into his mid-80s, retiring only after suffering a broken hand.

==Biography==
Milstein was born in Odessa, Russian Empire, the fourth child of seven, to a middle-class Jewish family with no musical background. It was a concert by the 11-year-old Jascha Heifetz that inspired his parents to make a violinist out of Milstein. As a child of seven, he started violin lessons (as suggested by his parents, to keep him out of trouble) with the eminent violin pedagogue Pyotr Stolyarsky, also the teacher of the violinist David Oistrakh.

When Milstein was 11, Leopold Auer invited him to become one of his students at the St. Petersburg Conservatory. Milstein reminisced:

Every little boy who had the dream of playing better than the other boy wanted to go to Auer. He was a very gifted man and a good teacher. I used to go to the Conservatory twice a week for classes. I played every lesson with forty or fifty people sitting and listening. Two pianos were in the classroom and a pianist accompanied us. When Auer was sick, he would ask me to come to his home.

Milstein may in fact have been the last Russian violinist to have had personal contact with Auer. Auer did not name Milstein in his memoirs but mentions &quot;two boys from Odessa ... both of whom disappeared after I left St. Petersburg in June 1917.&quot; Neither is Milstein&#x27;s name in the registry of the St Petersburg Conservatory.

Milstein also studied with Eugène Ysaÿe in Belgium. In the documentary &quot;Nathan Milstein – In Portrait&quot;, Milstein told the director Christopher Nupen that he learned almost nothing from Ysaÿe but enjoyed his company enormously. In a 1977 interview printed in &quot;High Fidelity&quot;, he said, &quot;I went to Ysaÿe in 1926 but he never paid any attention to me. I think it might have been better this way. I had to think for myself.&quot;

Milstein met Vladimir Horowitz and his pianist sister Regina in 1921 when he played a recital in Kiev. They invited him for tea at their parents&#x27; home. Milstein later said, &quot;I came for tea and stayed three years.&quot; Milstein and Horowitz performed together, as &quot;children of the revolution&quot;, throughout the Soviet Union and struck up a lifelong friendship. In 1925, they went on a concert tour of Western Europe together.

In 1929, Milstein made his American debut with Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra. He eventually settled in New York, gaining American citizenship in 1942. He toured repeatedly throughout Europe, maintaining residences in London and Paris.

A transcriber and composer, Milstein arranged many works for violin and wrote his own cadenzas for many concertos. He was obsessed with articulating each note perfectly and would often spend long periods of time working out fingerings which would make passages sound more articulated. One of his best-known compositions is &quot;Paganiniana&quot;, a set of variations on various themes from the works of Niccolò Paganini.

After playing many different violins in his earlier days, Milstein finally acquired the 1716 &quot;Goldman&quot; Stradivarius in 1945 which he used for the rest of his life. He renamed this Stradivarius the &quot;Maria Teresa&quot; in honor of his daughter Maria and his wife Therese. He also performed on the 1710 ex-&quot;Dancla&quot; Stradivarius for a short period.

In 1948, Milstein&#x27;s recording of Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Concerto in E minor, with Bruno Walter conducting the New York Philharmonic, was the first recording issued in Columbia&#x27;s LP format.

Milstein was awarded the Légion d&#x27;honneur by France in 1968 and received a Grammy Award for his recording of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Sonatas and Partitas&quot; in 1975. He was also awarded Kennedy Center honors by US President Ronald Reagan.

A recital he gave in Stockholm in June 1986, one of his last performances, was recorded in its entirety and shows the remarkable condition of his technique at age 82. A fall shortly afterward in which he severely broke his left hand ended his career.

During the late 1980s, Milstein published his memoirs, &quot;From Russia to the West&quot;, in which he discussed his life of constant performance and socializing. Milstein discusses the personalities of composers such as Alexander Glazunov, Sergei Prokofiev, Sergei Rachmaninoff and Igor Stravinsky and conductors such as Arturo Toscanini and Leopold Stokowski, all of whom he knew personally. He also discusses his best friends, pianist Vladimir Horowitz, cellist Gregor Piatigorsky and ballet director George Balanchine, as well as other violinists such as Fritz Kreisler and David Oistrakh.

Milstein was married twice, remaining married to his second wife, Therese, until his death. He died of a heart attack in London on December 21, 1992, 23 days before his 89th birthday. Therese died in 1999 aged 83.

<doc id="147083" wikidata="Q2455512" url="?curid=147083" title="Trophy wife">
<text>A trophy wife is a wife who is regarded as a status symbol for the husband. The term is often used in a derogatory or disparaging way, implying that the wife in question has little personal merit besides her physical attractiveness, requires substantial expense for maintaining her appearance, is often unintelligent or unsophisticated, does very little of substance beyond remaining attractive, and is in some ways synonymous with the term gold digger. A trophy wife is typically relatively young and attractive, and may be a second, third or later wife of an older, wealthier man. A trophy husband is the male equivalent.

== History ==
In his &quot;Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; (1899), Thorstein Veblen suggested that &quot;The original reason for the seizure and appropriation of women seems to have been their usefulness as trophies.&quot; The term&#x27;s more recent etymological origins are disputed. One claim is that &quot;trophy wife&quot; originally appeared in a 1950 issue of &quot;The Economist&quot; newspaper, referring to the historical practice of warriors capturing the most beautiful women during battle to bring home as wives. William Safire claimed that the term &quot;trophy wife&quot; was coined by Julie Connelly, a senior editor of &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine, in a cover story in the issue of August 28, 1989, and immediately entered common usage. Author Tom Wolfe, himself often credited with coining the term, disclaimed it in a talk given at Brown University in 1996, wherein he also credited &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine in an article published &quot;not that long ago&quot;. Many sources claim the term was coined earlier (for example, the &quot;Online Etymology Dictionary&quot; cites 1984), but easy online access to William Safire&#x27;s article about the term has led many (such as the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;) to believe that August 28, 1989, was its first use. However, the idiom is found in passing in a quote in a 1965 publication, apparently referring to the wife of Bernie Madoff. The 1994 marriage of former Playboy Playmate Anna Nicole Smith to oil billionaire J. Howard Marshall was widely followed by the US mass media as an extreme example of this concept. At the time of their marriage, he was 89 years old and she was 26.

Elizabeth McClintock, a sociologist at the University of Notre Dame, believes the phenomenon in modern society is less common than other research suggests.

<text>Nigel Kennedy (born 28 December 1956) is an English violinist and violist.

His early career was primarily spent performing classical music, and has since expanded into jazz, klezmer, and other music genres.

==Early life and background==
Kennedy&#x27;s grandfather was Lauri Kennedy, principal cellist with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, and his grandmother was Dorothy Kennedy, a pianist. Lauri and Dorothy Kennedy were Australian, while their son, the cellist John Kennedy, was born in England. After graduating from the Royal Academy of Music in London, at age 22, John joined the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, later becoming the principal cellist of Sir Thomas Beecham&#x27;s Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. While in England, John developed a relationship with an English pianist, Scylla Stoner, with whom he eventually toured in 1952 as part of the Llewellyn-Kennedy Piano Trio (with the violinist Ernest Llewellyn; Stoner was billed as &quot;Scylla Kennedy&quot; after she and John married). But they ultimately divorced, and John returned to Australia.

Kennedy was born in Brighton. A child prodigy, as a 10-year-old he picked out Fats Waller tunes on the piano after hearing his stepfather&#x27;s jazz records. At the age of 7, he became a pupil at the Yehudi Menuhin School of Music. He later studied at the Juilliard School in New York City with Dorothy DeLay. While there he helped to pay for his studies by busking with fellow student and cellist Thomas Demenga.

==Musical career==
===Until 2000===
At the age of 16, Kennedy was invited by jazz violinist Stéphane Grappelli to appear with him at New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall. He made his recording debut in 1984 with Elgar&#x27;s Violin Concerto. His subsequent recording of Vivaldi&#x27;s &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; with the English Chamber Orchestra in 1989 sold over two million copies and earned a place as one of the best-selling of all classical recordings. The album remained at the top of the UK classical charts for over a year, with total sales of over three million units.

In 1992, Kennedy announced the end of his career in classical music. Around this time, he recorded the album &quot;Music in Colours&quot; with Stephen Duffy. He returned to the international concert platform in the mid-1990s. In 1997, he received an award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music at the BRIT Awards, and in 2001 received the &#x27;Male Artist of the Year&#x27; award.

In other music genres, Kennedy recorded a cover of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Fire&quot; for the 1993 album &quot;Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix&quot;. The same year, he made an appearance on Robert Plant&#x27;s solo album Fate of Nations on the track &quot;Calling to you&quot;. In 1999, Sony Classical released &quot;The Kennedy Experience&quot;, which featured improvisational recordings based on Hendrix compositions. Kennedy&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Always Playing&quot;, was published in 1991.

===Since 2000===
In 2000, he recorded &quot;Riders on the Storm: The Doors Concerto&quot; (with Jaz Coleman), a violin-based orchestral version of Doors songs, including &quot;Strange Days&quot;, &quot;L.A. Woman&quot;, &quot;The End&quot;, and &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot;. On 27 November 2000, Kennedy joined rock group The Who at the Royal Albert Hall to play the violin solo in the song &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;, released three years later on the album &quot;Live at the Royal Albert Hall&quot;. Kennedy also played on several tracks – including &quot;Experiment IV&quot; – by British singer-songwriter Kate Bush, who was a guest on Kennedy&#x27;s episode of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. He was featured on two of Sarah Brightman&#x27;s songs for her 2003 album &quot;Harem&quot;. He has explored Klezmer music with the Polish jazz band Kroke. In late 2005, Kennedy recorded his first album for the Blue Note jazz label, released as &quot;Blue Note Sessions&quot;, with Ron Carter on double bass, Jack DeJohnette on drums and saxophonist Joe Lovano.

Kennedy returned to the 2008 Proms after an absence of 21 years, performing Elgar&#x27;s Violin Concerto and a late-night Prom with the Nigel Kennedy Quintet. He was appointed artistic director of the Polish Chamber Orchestra and in 2010, founded the Orchestra of Life, an ensemble of mainly Polish musicians.

In August 2013, he again returned to the Proms performing &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; at a concert featuring Kennedy with a group of young Palestinian musicians, the Palestine Strings from the Edward Said Conservatory of Music, and the Orchestra of Life. According to Michael Church of &quot;The Independent&quot;, in the first movement &quot;Spring&quot;, Kennedy &quot;swerved off-course with a flurry of bird-tweets followed by a jazz riff from his bassist; the staccato chords of the next movement were decorated by a microtonal Arabic riff from one of the guest players&quot;. Near the end of the concert, the BBC removed the violinist&#x27;s attribution of apartheid to Israel from the television broadcast on BBC4. The comments were broadcast live on BBC Radio 3. A representative of the Corporation said they did not &quot;fall within the editorial remit of the Proms as a classical music festival.&quot; Kennedy said:
 Kennedy objected to the removal of his remarks from the broadcast. A condition of the booking, to which Kennedy had agreed, was not making such a comment, according to his manager.

Kennedy also plays the viola, and has recorded Sir William Walton&#x27;s Viola Concerto. Kennedy&#x27;s own compositions include incidental music for Chekhov&#x27;s play &quot;Three Sisters&quot;. Kennedy published his second autobiography, &quot;Nigel Kennedy Uncensored!&quot;, in 2021.

===Image===

In 1991, the Controller of BBC Radio 3 John Drummond criticised Kennedy describing him as &quot;a Liberace for the nineties&quot; and objected to his &quot;ludicrous&quot; clothes and &quot;self-invented accent&quot;.

Until 2006, Kennedy expressed his intention of not appearing on the classical London concert scene with a London orchestra, which was seen by some as arrogance, although he rationalised it in terms of frustrated perfectionism:

It all comes down to the amount of rehearsal you get, or don&#x27;t get, in this country. I insist on three or four sessions prior to a concert, and orchestral administrators won&#x27;t accommodate that. If I didn&#x27;t care about getting it right, I could do three concerts in the same amount of time and earn three times the money. But you can&#x27;t do something properly in less time than it takes.

Kennedy expresses a preference for the immediate appeal of live performance, and often records entire works or movements in single takes to preserve this sense in his recordings. He also introduces improvised elements to his performances, as in his Jimi Hendrix-inspired cadenza to Beethoven&#x27;s Violin Concerto and his jazz and fusion recordings.

In September 2021, Kennedy cancelled a performance at the Royal Albert Hall after the host, Classic FM, prevented him from including a Jimi Hendrix composition at the concert. He had intended to perform a version of &quot;Little Wing&quot; in the manner of Ralph Vaughan Williams

==Personal life and politics==
Kennedy was romantically involved with singer/guitarist Brix Smith after she had broken up from and divorced husband Mark E. Smith in 1989. Kennedy currently divides his time among residences in Malvern, Worcestershire where his former girlfriend Eve Westmore and son Sark Yves Amadeus (born in 1997) reside, London and Kraków, Poland. He has been married twice; his second wife, Agnieszka (née Chowaniec), is a Polish actress and artistic director, born in April 1977.

Kennedy acknowledges regularly smoking cannabis to aid his creativity.

===Football===
Kennedy is an Aston Villa F.C. supporter. At Przystanek Woodstock 2010, he had his orchestra wear Aston Villa shirts and led the crowd in the team&#x27;s chants. While living and recording in Poland, he also took an active interest in KS Cracovia, in whose 100th anniversary club replica kit he appeared.

===Politics===
Kennedy is an avowed socialist. He supported David Davis&#x27;s campaign when he quit his Shadow Home Secretary post to force a by-election, in protest over proposals to allow terrorist suspects to be locked up for 42 days without charge. Kennedy is a vocal opponent of Israel&#x27;s policies in the West Bank, and, in the summer of 2007, he told a &quot;Haaretz&quot; reporter:

===Honours===
In 1991, he was awarded an honorary degree (Doctor of Letters, or Litt.D.) by the University of Bath.

<doc id="147089" wikidata="Q716009" url="?curid=147089" title="Red envelope">
<text>A red envelope, red packet, lai see (), hongbao or ang pau () is a gift of money given during holidays or for special occasions such as weddings, graduations, and birthdays. It originated in China before spreading across parts of Southeast Asia and other countries with sizable ethnic Chinese populations.

In the mid-2010s, a digital equivalent to the practice emerged within messaging apps with mobile wallet systems localized for the Chinese New Year, particularly WeChat.

==Usage==
Red envelopes containing cash, known as &quot;hongbao&quot; in Mandarin and &quot;laisee&quot; in Cantonese, are gifts presented at social and family gatherings such as weddings or holidays such as Chinese New Year; they are also gifted to guests as a gesture of hospitality. The red color of the envelope symbolizes good luck and wards off evil spirits. In Chinese, the red packet is also called &quot;money warding off old age&quot; () for Chinese New Year. 

The act of requesting red packets is normally called &#x27; () or &#x27; (), and, in the south of China, &quot;&quot; (). Red envelopes are usually given out to the younger generation who are normally in school or unmarried. 

The amount of money contained in the envelope usually ends with an even digit, following Chinese beliefs; odd-numbered money gifts are traditionally associated with funerals. An exception exists for the number nine, as the pronunciation of &quot;nine&quot; () is homophonous to the word &quot;long&quot; (), and is the largest single digit. In some regions of China and among the Chinese diaspora, odd numbers are favored for weddings because they are difficult to divide. One widespread tradition is that money should not be given in fours, or the number four should not appear in the amount, such as in 40, 400, and 444, as the pronunciation of the word &quot;four&quot; () is similar to the word &quot;death&quot; (). When giving money, new bills are favored over old bills. It is common to see long bank queues before Chinese New Year holding people waiting to acquire new bills.

At wedding banquets, the amount offered is usually intended to cover the cost of the attendees as well as signify goodwill to the newlyweds. The amounts given are often recorded in ceremonial ledgers for the new couple to keep.

In southern China, red envelopes are typically given by the married to the unmarried during Chinese New Year, mostly to children. In northern and southern China, red envelopes are typically given by the elders to those under 25 (30 in most of the three northeastern provinces), regardless of marital status. The money is usually in the form of notes to make it difficult to judge the amount before opening. In Malaysia it is common to add a coin to the notes, particularly in &quot;hongbao&quot; given to children, signifying even more luck.

It is traditional to avoid opening the envelopes in front of the relatives out of courtesy. However, to receive an envelope, the youth kowtow to thank their elders. In Hong Kong, red envelopes are traditionally opened on or after the 7th day of the Lunar New Year.

During Chinese New Year supervisors or business owners give envelopes to employees.

In Suzhou, children keep the red envelope in their bedroom after receiving it. They believe that putting the red envelope under their bed can protect the children. This action relates to the Chinese &quot; &quot;yā&quot;. Those &quot; would not be used until the end of Chinese New Year. They also receive fruit or cake during the celebration.

It is traditional to give an actor a red packet when he or she is to play a dead character, or pose for a picture for an obituary or a grave stone.

Red packets are also used to deliver payment for favorable service to lion dance performers, religious practitioners, teachers, and doctors.

Red packets as a form of bribery in China&#x27;s film industry, were revealed in 2014&#x27;s Sony hack.

In the Chinese communities of Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Macao, it is also customary for red packets to be given to service staff, such as security guards, cleaners, domestic helpers and doormen during the first few days of the Lunar New Year.

===Virtual red envelopes===
Virtual red envelopes are available on mobile payment platforms. During the Chinese New Year holiday in 2014, the messaging app WeChat introduced the ability to distribute virtual red envelopes of money to contacts and groups via its WeChat Pay platform. The launch included an on-air promotion during the CCTV New Year&#x27;s Gala — China&#x27;s most-watched television special — where viewers could win red envelopes as prizes.

WeChat Pay adoption increased following the launch, and over 32 billion virtual envelopes were sent over the Chinese New Year holiday in 2016 (a tenfold increase over 2015). The feature&#x27;s popularity spawned imitations from other vendors; a &quot;red envelope war&quot; emerged between WeChat owner Tencent and its historic rival, Alibaba Group, who added a similar function to its competing messaging service and held similar promotions. Analysts estimated that over 100 billion digital red envelopes would be sent over the New Year holiday in 2017. One study reported that this popularization of virtual red packets comes from their contagious feature—users who receive red packets feel obligated to follow.

==History==

The history of the red packet dates to the Han dynasty. People created a type of coin to ward off evil spirits, (), which was inscribed with auspicious words, such as &quot;May you live a long and successful life&quot;. It was believed to protect people from sickness and death.

In the Tang dynasty, the Chinese New Year was seen as the beginning of spring, and in addition to congratulations, elders gave money to children to ward off evil spirits.

After the Song and Yuan dynasties, the custom of giving money in the Spring Festival evolved into the custom of giving children lucky money. The elderly would thread coins with a red string.

The Ming and Qing dynasties featured two kinds of lucky money. One was made of red string and coins, sometimes placed at the foot of the bed in the shape of a dragon. The other was a colorful pouch filled with coins.

In Qing dynasty, the name &quot;&quot; () emerged. The book () recorded that &quot;elders give children coins threaded together by a red string, the money is called .&quot;

From the Republic of China (1912–1949) era, it evolved into 100 coins wrapped in red paper, meaning &quot;May you live a hundred years!&quot;. Due to the lack of holes in modern-day coins, red envelopes became more prevalent. Later, people adopted banknotes instead of coins.

After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, the custom of the elders giving the younger generation money continued.

==Other customs==

Other similar traditions also exist in other countries in Asia.

===Ethnic Chinese===
In Thailand, Myanmar (Burma), and Cambodia, the Chinese diaspora and immigrants introduced the practice of red envelopes.

===Cambodia===
In Cambodia, red envelopes are called &quot;ang pav&quot; or &quot;tae ea&quot; (&quot;give &quot;ang pav&quot;&quot;). &quot;Ang pav&quot; are delivered with best wishes to younger generations. &quot;Ang pav&quot; is an important gift as a symbol of good luck from the elders. &quot;Ang pav&quot; can be presented on the day of Chinese New Year or &quot;Saen Chen&quot;, when relatives gather. The gift is kept as a worship item in or under the pillowcase, or somewhere else, especially near the bed of young while they are sleeping. &quot;Ang pav&quot; can be either money or a cheque, and more or less according to the donors.

&quot;Ang pav&quot; are not given to someone in family who has a career, while such a person has to gift their parents and/or their younger children or siblings.

At weddings, the amount offered is scaled to cover the cost of the attendees as well as help the newlyweds.

===Vietnam===
Red envelopes are a traditional part of Vietnamese culture. They are considered to be lucky money and are typically given to children during Vietnamese New Year. They are generally given by elders and adults, where a greeting or offering health and longevity is exchanged. Common greetings include &quot; (), &quot; (), &quot; () and &quot; (), wishing health and prosperity. The typical name for lucky money is &quot;lì xì&quot; () or, less commonly, &quot;&quot; ().

===South Korea===
In South Korea, a monetary gift is given to children by their relatives during the New Year period. Bags known as &quot;bokjumeoni&quot; () are used instead of red envelopes.

===Japan===
Monetary gifts called are given to children during the New Year period. White or are used instead of red, with the name of the receiver usually written on the front. A similar practice, , is observed for Japanese weddings, but the envelope is folded rather than sealed, and decorated with an elaborate bow, called .

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, Chinese Filipinos (known locally as &quot;Filipino-Chinese&quot;) exchange red envelopes (termed &quot;ang pao&quot;) during the Lunar New Year or &quot;Chinese New Year&quot;. Red envelopes have gained acceptance in the broader Philippine society. Filipinos with no Chinese heritage appropriated the custom for occasions such as birthdays and in giving monetary &quot;aguinaldo&quot; during Christmas and New Year. Due to the phonetics of most Philippine languages, red envelopes are nowadays more well-known as &quot;ampaw&quot;.

===Green envelope===

Malay Muslims in Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, and Singapore adopted the Chinese custom as part of their Eid al-Fitr () celebrations, but instead of red packets other colored envelopes are used, most commonly green. Customarily a family gives (usually small) amounts of money in green envelopes, and may send them to friends and family unable to visit. Green is used for its traditional association with Islam. The adaptation of the red envelope is based on the Muslim custom of &quot;sadaqah&quot;, or voluntary charity. While present in the Qur&#x27;an, &quot;sadaqah&quot; is less formally established than the sometimes similar practice of &quot;zakat&quot;, and in many cultures this takes a form closer to gift-giving and generosity among friends than charity. I.e. no attempt is made to give more to guests &quot;in need&quot;, nor is it a religious obligation. Among the Sundanese people, a boy who had been recently circumcised is given monetary gifts known as &quot;panyecep&quot; or &quot;uang sunatan&quot;.

===Purple envelope===
The tradition of &quot;ang pao&quot; was adopted by local Indian Hindu populations of Singapore and Malaysia for Deepavali. They are known as &quot;Deepavali ang pow&quot; (in Malaysia), &quot;purple ang pow&quot; or simply &quot;ang pow&quot; (in Singapore). Yellow colored envelopes for Deepavali were give in the past.

<doc id="147091" wikidata="Q918319" url="?curid=147091" title="Butt plug">
<text>A butt plug is a sex toy that is designed to be inserted into the rectum for sexual pleasure. They often have a flanged end to prevent the device from being lost inside the rectum.

==History==
Rectal dilators were originally designed for therapeutic uses and later marketed with terms such as Dr. Young&#x27;s Ideal Rectal Dilators, which were marketed as a cure for insanity and constipation. In the late 20th century, similar devices started to be marketed as sex toys.

==Basics==
Unlike the vagina, which is closed off by the cervix, the rectum leads to the sigmoid colon. Objects that are inserted into the rectum can therefore potentially travel up into the bowel; the flared end on a butt plug exists to prevent this. Some dildos lack a flared end, and thus it is not advised to use such dildos anally since they may get stuck; rectal foreign bodies may require medical extraction.

In addition, the lower bowel above the rectum is easily perforated. For this reason, butt plugs tend to be shorter than dildos, and their marked size generally indicates the circumference of the device rather than the length. They must also be very smooth to avoid damaging the rectum or bowel. In order to get them into the rectum, they most commonly have a general profile of a round-ended cone which then narrows to a &quot;waist&quot; which locates itself at the anal sphincter, with the flared part outside the body, preventing the butt plug from slipping further into the body. The sphincter muscle will hold the plug in place by the waist, preventing the plug from slipping out unintentionally.

Butt plugs can be moved in or out for pleasure, so as to simulate the rhythmic thrusting of penetrative sex, although some butt plugs are specifically designed for stimulation of the prostate.

As with other activities involving anal penetration, such as anal sex, large amounts of sexual lubricant and a slow gentle approach are needed to insert or remove a butt plug.

Butt plugs are sometimes covered by condoms for hygiene and to allow for the easy disposal of any feces with which they may come into contact. Nevertheless, they should not be shared with other people, due to the risk of transmitting sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, from the transfer of body fluids from one person to another.

==Designs==
Butt plugs come in a variety of colors, shapes, sizes, and textures. Some are designed to look like penises, while some are ribbed or wavy. Many have a thin tip which is wider in the middle, a notch to hold it in place once it is inserted, and a flared base to prevent complete insertion into the rectum. Some plugs have an egg-shaped penetrative part. Some plugs are designed (long, flexible and curved) to penetrate the sigmoid colon.

Butt plugs are made of a variety of materials, the most common being latex. Other materials used include silicone, neoprene, wood, metal, glass, stone, and many other materials. Silicone is a particularly good material, as it can be disinfected in boiling water.

===Fetish plugs===
Fetish plugs are any kind of butt plugs that are designed in a way to be unusual, exciting, or unique in some way. A fetish plug is called such because it caters to sexual fetishes. One common type of fetish plug has a tail of long hair or synthetic fur attached to the non-insertable end so that, when inserted, the impression is given that the wearer has an animal&#x27;s tail. Some plugs popular in animal roleplay have their tails molded from medical grade silicone as opposed to faux fur. The firmness of the silicone, when combined with bodily movements or rhythmic pelvic-floor muscle contractions, allow for a simulated tail &quot;wag&quot;. There are also vibrating plugs and plugs which utilize erotic electro-stimulation. Additional variations include plugs that can &quot;ejaculate&quot; by squirting water or other fluids such as lubricant, oil, etc., into the rectum, and inflatable plugs (intended to expand the rectum).

==Risks==
Sex toys that are used in the anus can easily get lost as rectal muscles contract and can suck an object up and up, potentially obstructing the colon; to prevent this from occurring, it is recommended that individuals use sex toys with a flared base or a string. However, the flared flange is not a foolproof method of preventing the plug from entering the rectum completely with the inability to retrieve it. This is uncomfortable and may require medical intervention. Butt plugs of excess diameter can, especially when inserted too rapidly and/or too forcefully, lead to sphincter tear, detachment or other rectal failure. Kegel exercises can help maintain normal, healthy sphincter function. When inserting a butt plug, one should be gentle, use plenty of lubrication, start with smaller sizes, and exercise patience. While medical data is sparse, some recommend not leaving a butt plug inserted for longer than two to three hours, though anecdotal evidence dictates some users wear their plugs for even longer; some committed practitioners only remove them so as to be able to pass stool.

== In culture ==

The sculpture named &quot;Santa Claus&quot; or the &quot;Buttplug Gnome&quot; was erected in Rotterdam by Paul McCarthy. The same artist&#x27;s 2014 sculpture &quot;Tree&quot; was also deliberately jokingly designed to look like a butt plug.

<doc id="147092" wikidata="Q10807" url="?curid=147092" title="Cock ring">
<text>A cock ring is a ring worn around the penis, usually at the base. The primary purpose of wearing a cock ring is to restrict the flow of blood from the erect penis to produce a stronger erection. It can also be used increase girth and/or to maintain an erection for a longer period of time. They are sometimes used as medical devices, on their own or in conjunction with a penis pump to assist in the management of erectile dysfunction. Genital adornment is another purpose, as is repositioning the genitals to provide an enhanced appearance.

When used in cases of erectile dysfunction (ED), they are known by various other names, such as erection rings and tension rings.

Cock rings worn just behind the corona of the glans of the penis are known as glans rings, head rings or cock crowns. A ring that is worn around the penis and scrotum is also usually called a cock ring, but is sometimes referred to as a cock and ball ring. Rings that are worn just around the scrotum, in order to hold the testicles, are called testicle cuffs or ball stretchers.

==Uses==
The purpose of a cock ring is to trap blood inside the penis in order to maintain an erection, or encourage a stronger erection. In order to do this, it must be placed at the base of the penis.

A ring made of stretchy material is stretched over the penis (and optionally also the scrotum, except when used with a pump for impotence) and situated against the body. Rigid rings are used differently: first each testicle is fed through the ring and the entire scrotum is pulled through, then the flaccid penis is pushed through the ring and the ring is situated against the body.

=== Medical ===
An erection ring may be worn to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). When used for ED, a purpose-designed vacuum pump is used to produce an erection by simple mechanical and hydrodynamical action in spite of vascular or nerve damage, and the ring is slid off the pump&#x27;s cylinder onto the base of the penis to maintain the erection before it is lost. The testicles are not ringed in this case. When used with a pump, a lubricating gel is always used to help the pump maintain a vacuum, in the same way vacuum grease is used with a vacuum pump in scientific applications. The gel also makes it easier for the ring to slide off the pump, and later, to remove it from the penis.

===Recreational===
A cock ring may be used during sex or masturbation to prolong or enhance erections, delay orgasm, or for the sensation of tightness and engorgement that wearing one produces; vibrating models apply vibration to the base of the user&#x27;s penis and to their partner. They can be worn as sex toys or for aesthetic reasons.

==Variations==
Some models include a protruding clitoral stimulator, designed to tickle the vulva or anus during sex (and during masturbation while the ring is used on a dildo). Others, such as the vibrating ring, vibrate, either vibrating the ring itself, or using two removable bullet vibrators to provide stimulation to the testicles and clitoris. Some cock rings have vibrators attached that can be worn to stimulate the scrotum or perineum of a partner during sexual intercourse. Many women find that rings with vibrator attachments provide clitoral stimulation that is needed for achieving orgasm.

Another variation is an inflatable or stackable ring design, which can limit the depth of penetration to protect the receiving partner from pain or discomfort. 

A triple cock ring or triple crown is a cock ring that has additional rings for restraining the testicles. In orgasm, the testicles usually retract towards the body before ejaculation. A triple crown changes and intensifies the sensation of orgasm by forcing the testicles to stay away from the body.

==Risks==
Vendors of cock rings and medical sources indicate that cock rings are not to be worn for more than about 30 minutes. Falling asleep or using illicit drugs at the same time is very dangerous. The first sign of pending problems is when the penis starts to become numb, painful, or cold. As soon as this happens, the cock ring must be removed.

===Medical issues===
Cock rings that are too tight, or worn for too long can be dangerous: this may cause priapism, a medical emergency that, if not treated promptly, can result in severe and permanent damage, including penile gangrene that can result in the destruction and possible amputation of the penis. Rings for erectile dysfunction are invariably supplied with the instruction that they should not be left on for more than thirty minutes. Falling asleep with a ring on is a particular danger. This may lead to temporary or permanent nerve damage. Numbness in the glans penis, penis becoming cold or penis becoming white may be signs that a cock ring has been worn for too long and medical advice should be sought.

Cock rings must not be used without medical advice by those who have cardiovascular problems or who take blood-thinning medication.

==Materials and types==
Commercially available cock rings are made from many different materials, including leather, rubber, silicone, neoprene, nylon, metals (such as aluminium, steel, titanium, silver, gold and platinum), wood, plastic, bone, horn, ceramic, glass, and semi-precious stone. They also come in a wide variety of sizes, with an inner diameter ranging from .

Designs range from the simple to the complex. Simple rings may lie flat on a surface, while others are ergonomically curved to fit more comfortably on the wearer. Some designs are horseshoe-shaped with a closure. In cross-section, the rings may vary from round to flattened oval, the latter offering more friction on the penis; these are, therefore, less likely to slip. Many modern rings also have different accessories and projections.

There are also vibrating cock rings which can stimulate the testes at the same time.

Some cock rings come with accessories that stimulate the clitoris or anal area during intercourse. Other cock rings go around the scrotum and can significantly enhance erection and the intensity of orgasms.

However, there is one disadvantage: the more accessories that are added on, the greater the chance of developing discomfort or cold sensations from the device.

Rings for ED must be able to be placed in position while a pump is connected; the erection is lost as soon as vacuum is removed, unless the ring is already in place. This rules out most types other than simple elastic rings.

===Specialized underwear===
Specialized underwear is available which comes with pre-fitted cock rings. The underwear has a pouch with an internal fabric/elastic cock ring which either slides along the penis and encircles the scrotum or, alternatively, simply snaps around the base of the scrotum to snugly—but not in a constricting way—attach the pouch to the genitals. While this type of pouch permits the wearer to &quot;go backless&quot;, C ring pouches can be attached to either a thong or traditional jockstrap.

<doc id="147093" wikidata="Q648679" url="?curid=147093" title="Lake Nemi">
<text>Lake Nemi (, , also called Diana&#x27;s Mirror, ) is a small circular volcanic lake in the Alban Hills south of Rome in the Lazio region of Italy. It takes its name from Nemi, the largest town in the area, which overlooks it from a height.

It was formed in an ancient volcanic crater created at least 36,000 years ago.

The lake is famous for its great sunken Roman ships built under Caligula.

==Archaeology and history==

From the 6th century BC, the lake and its forest were sacred to the goddess Diana Nemorensis and the site of the festival Nemoralia. The sacred grove of Aricia was where a priest called the Rex Nemorensis reigned until he was killed by a challenger. The monumental sanctuary of Diana was built around 300 BC as the centre of the religion.

In Roman times up to 6 large villas lay on the rim of the crater taking advantage of the cool summer air and fine views over the lake and the sea. Only one villa is known to be on the shore of the lake: the villa in the locality of Santa Maria on the western shore.

Emperors Tiberius and Caligula sailed Lake Nemi not merely to cool off in summer, but to assert themselves as Nemorenses, rulers aligning with the Stars, wedded to Earth&#x27;s perpetual life-force.

===Villa at Santa Maria===
The villa was excavated between 1998 and 2002. It was built in the late Republican era, mid-first century BC, and underwent 4 remodelling phases until the 120s AD. The size and quality of the villa, and the fact that it was the only one located on the lake strongly indicate that it was an imperial villa and the one &quot;in nemorensi&quot; (in Diana’s sacred wood) owned by Julius Caesar. It stayed in imperial ownership probably being used as a base by Caligula.

It is situated on a large artificial terrace of which stretched 260 m along the shore with a width of 60 m and 9 m high above the lake.

The northern sector was smaller and simply decorated and was probably the living quarters for the villa’s servants. The rooms had geometric monochrome floors and a small bath suite north of the villa built in the fourth phase probably also for servants.

The central part was sumptuously decorated for &quot;public&quot; functions and entertainment while the southern part was for private family use. The central part was built around a large peristyle 21.3 x 13.5 m with a rich marble &quot;opus sectile&quot; floor. On the north side of this peristyle was a large &quot;triclinium&quot; overlooking the lake, also with an opus sectile floor. Surrounding the peristyle on western and southern sides were living rooms (&quot;cubicula&quot;) decorated with opus sectile floors and walls with coloured stucco.

The private wing was very richly decorated and was dominated by two large features intended for the owner&#x27;s private uses: a long pool and a huge exedra, between which were the residential quarters and baths of the owner. The exedra had a semicircular main room of diameter 21 m and two wings of total 48 m width, built against the rock. Parallel to the exedra was a 1.1 m wide water channel. The long pool built in the early first century AD was over 63 m long, 4.3 m wide and 1 m deep with 0.75 m wide mortar walls was cut partly into the rock of the terrace. At its southern end was a circular pool with steps leading into the basin. It was parallel to the terrace wall with a garden between them. The channel was fed from a cistern, 34 x 8 m and height 6 m, which still exists above the villa.

===The emissary===

Lake Nemi, like that of Albano, has no natural outlets and all the water comes from rain in the crater. Originally the level must have greatly fluctuated. Hence the lake level was controlled from rising too high in ancient times by an emissary connected to a 1650 m-long tunnel dug through the crater wall and ending in Vallericca c. 10 m lower. It dates from before circa 300 BC when the upper inlet was closed and replaced by an entrance around 11 m lower to further reduce the level of the lake and which had a series of chambers.

In planning the tunnel the shortest path from the lake to the outside was used consistent with the minimum downhill slope needed. The tunnel connects the lake with the adjacent crater of Ariccia, which was also occupied by a lake at that time and later reclaimed.

It was a monumental, if invisible, project which involved many workers not least to dispose of the excavated material and to transport it away. The original tunnel varied between 0.7 and 1 m wide meaning that only one person could be at the excavation face at a time. No intermediate shafts were used in the central part, unlike other tunnels, to speed up the work and lower the orientation error, but to set the initial direction of the tunnels at the two ends several vertical shafts were included there. Tunnelling would have started at the outlet end to avoid flooding of the workface from groundwater but when hard basalt rock was encountered tunnelling also from the inlet seems to have been added.

The emissary entrance is a few metres above the current level of the lake, on the south-western shore. An 18th century portal gives access to a first stretch of tunnel clad with large opus quadratum blocks for about 25 m. A stone plate with circular holes, part of which is still in situ, was a filter to prevent entry of logs and other large debris. Grooves in the walls are clearly visible for bulkheads which could control the flow of water and allowing the filters to be cleaned. The original plan was for the entrance to be on the same level as the floor of the main tunnel but there is a steep slope from the outside to avoid water entering the tunnel while under construction. The entrance floor was to be lowered once completed but this was never done.

From the entrance a narrow tunnel leads, after about 150 m, into the trapezoidal tunnel.

After Vallericca the water flowed in an open-air channel for about 2 km before another underground section for 600 m, the so-called Aricino tunnel.

<doc id="147100" wikidata="Q656448" url="?curid=147100" title="Three Represents">
<text>The Three Represents, officially the Theory of Three Represents, is a sociopolitical theory that defines the role of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Chinese society. It was first introduced by Jiang Zemin—then the General Secretary of the CCP—on 25 February 2000, while he was on the inspection tour in Gaozhou, Guangdong. It was ratified by the party at the 16th Party Congress in 2002. The theory legitimized the entry of private business owners and bourgeois elements into the CCP.

==History and development==

Following the tenure of Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin articulated a new theory to define the new relationship between the party and the people, which is named Three Represents. Jiang first delivered a speech about the Three Represents on 25 February 2000 during a symposium on party building in Guangzhou. It brought wide attention and many interpretations of the meaning of the speech.

The Three Represents results from Jiang Zemin&#x27;s efforts to grapple with the diverse class backgrounds of party members and their sometimes conflicting material interests. Based on Mao&#x27;s premise that the Communist Party should serve the people, it became important as China&#x27;s private sector grew to bring &quot;worthy people from all sectors who are loyal to the motherland and to socialism&quot; into the Party.

In Jiang&#x27;s speech on the Three Represents on the 80th anniversary of the founding of the CCP in 2001, he claimed that the expansion of &quot;working class&quot; would help the party remain advanced as the vanguard of the working class by expanding its popular support and increasing its social influence. Jiang made a statement on the concept of the working class that it includes intellectuals:&quot;With intellectuals being part of the working class, the scientific, technical and educational level of the working class has been raised considerably... Consequently some workers have changed their jobs. But this has not changed the status of the Chinese working class. On the contrary, this will serve to improve the overall quality of the working class and give play to its advantages as a group in the long run. The Chinese working class has always been the basic force for promoting the advanced productive forces in China. Our Party must remain the vanguard of the working class and unswervingly and wholeheartedly rely on the working class.&quot;The Three Represents were written into the CCP constitution during the 16th Party National Congress in November 2002. It was also written to the Chinese Constitution on March 14, 2004.

== Content ==
The theory requires the CCP to:
# Represent the development trend of China&#x27;s advanced productive forces.
# Represent the orientation of China&#x27;s advanced culture.
# Represent the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people.
In this context, to &quot;represent&quot; means to incorporate.

== Influence and reception ==
Jiang&#x27;s theory was the subject of significant internal debate. Supporters viewed it as a further development of socialism with Chinese characteristics or a mechanism to incorporate bourgeois elements into the discipline of the party. Certain segments within the CCP criticized the Three Represents as being un-Marxist and a betrayal of basic Marxist values. Criticism originated on all ideological sides of the party.

Jiang said that by representing Chinese people in three levels, the party used the interests and demands of the overwhelming majority of the people to replace the specific interests of people from different quarters, especially the class nature of the working class. As Xiao Gongqin argues, the innovation of the &quot;Three Represents&quot; theory was meant to complete the historical ideology transformation of CCP from a revolutionary party to a ruling party. The CCP can keep its legitimacy under the &#x27;socialist market economy&#x27; or any system that is conducive to the development of advanced productive forces, without promoting any revolutionary movement or keeping the ideal of egalitarianism.

Jiang disagreed with the assertion that his theories were not Marxist, and concluded that attaining the communist mode of production (as formulated by earlier communists) was more complex than had been realized; it was useless to try to force a change, as it had to develop naturally by following the economic laws of history. The theory is most notable for allowing capitalists, officially referred to as the &quot;new social strata&quot;, to join the party on the grounds that they engaged in &quot;honest labour and work&quot; and through their labour contributed &quot;to build[ing] socialism with Chinese characteristics.&quot; Jiang&#x27;s decision to allow capitalists into the CCP was criticized as &quot;political misconduct&quot; and &quot;ideological confusions&quot;. These critiques helped fuel the rise of the Chinese New Left movement.

Zheng Bijian, the executive vice president of the Central Party School who has been active in helping to create the Three Represents, argued that a party of the whole people would be a catch-all party that would include diverse and conflicting interests. To include all of the broad mass of contemporary Chinese intellectuals, science and technology workers, cultural workers, and economic managers, in the category of the so-called &#x27;middle class&#x27; would weaken or even obliterate the working class.

At the time Jiang announced the theory, most entrepreneurs who were members of the CCP had been party members before starting their businesses. This change allowed for a new cohort of party members who could join after having had success in business. The greatest jump in the numbers of party members who are also entrepreneurs came in 2001, not long after the announcement of the Three Represents. In recent years (as of 2022), around 30-35% of Chinese entrepreneurs have been party members.

Academic Lin Chun writes that while &quot;nothing was politically incorrect in this banal statement&quot; of the Three Represents, &quot;it simply signaled that the party no longer even pretended to be the vanguard of the working class.&quot;

Academics Steve Tsang and Olivia Cheung observe that the Three Represents helped co-opt economic elites and extend the party&#x27;s reach into the growing private sector. Academic Pang Laikwan describes the Three Represents as legitimating privately-owned enterprises in the context of the socialist market economy.

<text>&quot;Big Three&quot; music labels
A record label or record company is a brand or trademark of music recordings and music videos, or the company that owns it. Sometimes, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos, while also conducting talent scouting and development of new artists, artist financing and maintaining contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term &quot;record label&quot; derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer&#x27;s name, along with other information.

Within the mainstream music industry, recording artists have traditionally been reliant upon record labels to broaden their consumer base, market their albums, and promote their singles on streaming services, radio, and television. Record labels also provide publicists, who assist performers in gaining positive media coverage, and arrange for their merchandise to be available via stores and other media outlets.

== Major versus independent record labels ==

Record labels may be small, localized and &quot;independent&quot; (&quot;indie&quot;), or they may be part of a large international media group, or somewhere in between. The Association of Independent Music (AIM) defines a &#x27;major&#x27; as &quot;a multinational company which (together with the companies in its group) has more than 5% of the world market(s) for the sale of records or music videos.&quot; , there are only three labels that can be referred to as &quot;major labels&quot;: Universal Music Group, Sony Music, and Warner Music Group. In 2014, AIM estimated that the majors had a collective global market share of some 65–70%.

== Major labels ==

=== Present ===

=== Past ===
Record labels are often under the control of a corporate umbrella organization called a &quot;music group&quot;. A music group is usually affiliated to an international conglomerate &quot;holding company&quot;, which often has non-music divisions as well. A music group controls and consists of music-publishing companies, record (sound recording) manufacturers, record distributors, and record labels. Record companies (manufacturers, distributors, and labels) may also constitute a &quot;record group&quot; which is, in turn, controlled by a music group. The constituent companies in a music group or record group are sometimes marketed as being &quot;divisions&quot; of the group.

From 1929 to 1998, there were six major record labels, known as the Big Six:

# Warner Music Group
# EMI
# Sony Music (known as CBS Records until January 1991)
# BMG (formed in 1985 as RCA/Ariola International)
# Universal Music Group (known as MCA Music until 1996)
# PolyGram

PolyGram was merged into Universal Music Group (UMG) in 1999, leaving the remaining record labels to be known as the Big Five.

In 2004, Sony and BMG agreed to a joint venture and merged their recorded music division to create the Sony BMG label (which would be renamed Sony Music Entertainment after a 2008 merger); BMG kept its music publishing division separate from Sony BMG and later sold BMG Music Publishing to UMG. In 2007, the remaining record labels—then known as the Big Four—controlled about 70% of the world music market, and about 80% of the United States music market.

In 2012, the major divisions of EMI were sold off separately by owner Citigroup: most of EMI&#x27;s recorded music division was absorbed into UMG; EMI Music Publishing was absorbed into Sony/ATV Music Publishing; finally, EMI&#x27;s Parlophone and Virgin Classics labels were absorbed into Warner Music Group (WMG) in July 2013. This left the so-called Big Three labels.

In 2020 and 2021, both WMG and UMG had their IPO with WMG starting trading at Nasdaq and UMG starting trading at Euronext Amsterdam and leaving only Sony Music as wholly-owned subsidiary of an international conglomerate (Sony Entertainment which in turn is owned by Sony Group Corporation).

== Independent ==
Record labels and music publishers that are not under the control of the big three are generally considered to be &quot;independent&quot; (&quot;indie&quot;), even if they are large corporations with complex structures. The term &quot;indie label&quot; is sometimes used to refer to only those independent labels that adhere to independent criteria of corporate structure and size, and some consider an indie label to be almost any label that releases non-mainstream music, regardless of its corporate structure.

Independent labels are often considered more artist-friendly. Though they may have less sales power, indie labels typically offer larger artist royalty with a 50% profit-share agreement, aka 50–50 deal, not uncommon. In addition, independent labels are often artist-owned (although not always), with a stated intent often being to control the quality of the artist&#x27;s output. Independent labels usually do not enjoy the resources available to the &quot;big three&quot; and as such will often lag behind them in market shares. However, frequently independent artists manage a return by recording for a much smaller production cost of a typical big label release. Sometimes they are able to recoup their initial advance even with much lower sales numbers.

On occasion, established artists, once their record contract has finished, move to an independent label. This often gives the combined advantage of name recognition and more control over one&#x27;s music along with a larger portion of royalty profits. Artists such as Dolly Parton, Aimee Mann, Prince, Public Enemy, among others, have done this. Historically, companies started in this manner have been re-absorbed into the major labels (two examples are American singer Frank Sinatra&#x27;s Reprise Records, which has been owned by Warner Music Group for some time now, and musician Herb Alpert&#x27;s A&amp;M Records, now owned by Universal Music Group). Similarly, Madonna&#x27;s Maverick Records (started by Madonna with her manager and another partner) was to come under control of Warner Music when Madonna divested herself of controlling shares in the company.

Some independent labels become successful enough that major record companies negotiate contracts to either distribute music for the label or in some cases, purchase the label completely, to the point where it functions as an imprint or sublabel.

== Imprint ==

A label used as a trademark or brand and not a company is called an imprint, a term used for a similar concept in publishing. An imprint is often marketed as a &quot;unit&quot; or &quot;division&quot; of the parent label, though in most cases, they operate as pseudonym for it and do not exist as a distinct business operation or separate business structure (although trademarks are sometimes registered). 

A record label may give a musical act an imprint as part of their branding, while other imprints serve to house other activities, such as side ventures of that label.

== Sublabel ==
Music collectors often use the term &quot;sublabel&quot; to refer to either an imprint or a subordinate label company (such as those within a group). For example, in the 1980s and 1990s, 4th &amp; B&#x27;way Records (pronounced as &quot;Broadway&quot;) was a trademarked brand owned by Island Records Ltd. in the UK and by a subordinate branch, Island Records, Inc., in the United States. The center label on a 4th &amp; Broadway record marketed in the United States would typically bear a 4th &amp; B&#x27;way logo and would state in the fine print, &quot;4th &amp; B&#x27;way™, an Island Records, Inc. company&quot;. Collectors discussing labels as brands would say that 4th &amp; B&#x27;way is a sublabel or imprint of just &quot;Island&quot; or &quot;Island Records&quot;. Similarly, collectors who choose to treat corporations and trademarks as equivalent might say 4th &amp; B&#x27;way is an imprint and/or sublabel of both Island Records, Ltd. and that company&#x27;s sublabel, Island Records, Inc. However, such definitions are complicated by the corporate mergers that occurred in 1989 (when Island was sold to PolyGram) and 1998 (when PolyGram merged with Universal). PolyGram held sublabels including Mercury, Island and Motown. Island remained registered as corporations in both the United States and UK, but control of its brands changed hands multiple times as new companies were formed, diminishing the corporation&#x27;s distinction as the &quot;parent&quot; of any sublabels.

== Vanity labels ==
Vanity labels are labels that bear an imprint that gives the impression of an artist&#x27;s ownership or control, but in fact represent a standard artist/label relationship. In such an arrangement, the artist will control nothing more than the usage of the name on the label, but may enjoy a greater say in the packaging of their work. An example of such a label is the Neutron label owned by ABC while at Phonogram Inc. in the UK. At one point artist Lizzie Tear (under contract with ABC themselves) appeared on the imprint, but it was devoted almost entirely to ABC&#x27;s offerings and is still used for their re-releases (though Phonogram owns the masters of all the work issued on the label).

However, not all labels dedicated to particular artists are completely superficial in origin. Many artists, early in their careers, create their own labels which are later bought out by a bigger company. If this is the case it can sometimes give the artist greater freedom than if they were signed directly to the big label. There are many examples of this kind of label, such as Nothing Records, owned by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails; and Morning Records, owned by the Cooper Temple Clause, who were releasing EPs for years before the company was bought by RCA.

== Relationship with artists ==

If an artist and a label want to work together, whether an artist has contacted a label directly, usually by sending their team a demo, or the Artists &amp; Repertoire team of the label has scouted the artist and reached out directly, they will usually enter in to a contractual relationship.

A label typically enters into an exclusive recording contract with an artist to market the artist&#x27;s recordings in return for royalties on the selling price of the recordings. Contracts may extend over short or long durations, and may or may not refer to specific recordings. Established, successful artists tend to be able to renegotiate their contracts to get terms more favorable to them, but Prince&#x27;s much-publicized 1994–1996 feud with Warner Bros. Records provides a strong counterexample, as does Roger McGuinn&#x27;s claim, made in July 2000 before a US Senate committee, that the Byrds never received any of the royalties they had been promised for their biggest hits, &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; and &quot;Turn! Turn!, Turn!&quot;.

A contract either provides for the artist to deliver completed recordings to the label, or for the label to undertake the recording with the artist. For artists without a recording history, the label is often involved in selecting producers, recording studios, additional musicians, and songs to be recorded, and may supervise the output of recording sessions. For established artists, a label is usually less involved in the recording process.

The relationship between record labels and artists can be a difficult one. Many artists have had conflicts with their labels over the type of sound or songs they want to make, which can result in the artist&#x27;s artwork or titles being changed before release. Other artists have had their music prevented from release, or shelved. Record labels generally do this because they believe that the album will sell better if the artist complies with the label&#x27;s desired requests or changes. At times, the record label&#x27;s decisions are prudent ones from a commercial perspective, but these decisions may frustrate artists who feel that their art is being diminished or misrepresented by such actions.

In other instances, record labels have shelved artists&#x27; albums with no intention of any promotion for the artist in question. Reasons for shelving can include the label deciding to focus its resources on other artists on its roster, or the label undergoing a restructure where the person that signed the artist and supports the artist&#x27;s vision is no longer present to advocate for the artist. In extreme cases, record labels can prevent the release of an artist&#x27;s music for years, while also declining to release the artist from their contract, leaving the artist in a state of limbo. Artists who have had disputes with their labels over ownership and control of their music have included Taylor Swift, Tinashe, Megan Thee Stallion, Kelly Clarkson, Thirty Seconds to Mars, Clipse, Ciara, JoJo, Michelle Branch, Kesha, Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, Paul McCartney, and Johnny Cash.

In the early days of the recording industry, recording labels were absolutely necessary for the success of any artist. The first goal of any new artist or band was to get signed to a contract as soon as possible. In the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, many artists were so desperate to sign a contract with a record company that they sometimes ended up signing agreements in which they sold the rights to their recordings to the record label forever. Entertainment lawyers are usually employed by artists to discuss contract terms.

Due to advancing technology such as the Internet, the role of labels is rapidly changing, as artists are able to freely distribute their own material through online radio, peer-to-peer file sharing such as BitTorrent, and other services, at little to no cost, but with correspondingly low financial returns. Established artists, such as Nine Inch Nails, whose career was developed with major label backing, announced an end to their major label contracts, citing that the uncooperative nature of the recording industry with these new trends is hurting musicians, fans and the industry as a whole. However, Nine Inch Nails later returned to working with a major label, admitting that they needed the international marketing and promotional reach that a major label can provide. Radiohead also cited similar motives with the end of their contract with EMI when their album &quot;In Rainbows&quot; was released as a &quot;pay what you want&quot; sales model as an online download, but they also returned to a label for a conventional release. Research shows that record labels still control most access to distribution.

== New label strategies ==

Computers and internet technology led to an increase in file sharing and direct-to-fan digital distribution, causing music sales to plummet in recent years. Labels and organizations have had to change their strategies and the way they work with artists. New types of deals called &quot;multiple rights&quot; or &quot;360&quot; deals are being made with artists, where labels are given rights and percentages to artist&#x27;s touring, merchandising, and endorsements. In exchange for these rights, labels usually give higher advance payments to artists, have more patience with artist development, and pay higher percentages of CD sales. These 360 deals are most effective when the artist is established and has a loyal fan base. For that reason, labels now have to be more relaxed with the development of artists because longevity is the key to these types of pact. Several artists such as Paramore, Maino, and even Madonna have signed such types of deals.

A look at an actual 360 deal offered by Atlantic Records to an artist shows a variation of the structure. Atlantic&#x27;s document offers a conventional cash advance to sign the artist, who would receive a royalty for sales after expenses were recouped. With the release of the artist&#x27;s first album, however, the label has an option to pay an additional $200,000 in exchange for 30 percent of the net income from all touring, merchandise, endorsements, and fan-club fees. Atlantic would also have the right to approve the act&#x27;s tour schedule, and the salaries of certain tour and merchandise sales employees hired by the artist. In addition, the label also offers the artist a 30 percent cut of the label&#x27;s album profits—if any—which represents an improvement from the typical industry royalty of 15 percent.

=== Internet and digital labels ===
With the Internet now being the dominant source for obtaining music, netlabels have emerged. Depending on the ideals of the net label, music files from the artists may be downloaded free of charge or for a fee that is paid via PayPal or other online payment system. Some of these labels also offer hard copy CDs in addition to direct download. Digital Labels are the latest version of a &#x27;net&#x27; label. Whereas &#x27;net&#x27; labels were started as a free site, digital labels represent more competition for the major record labels.

=== Open-source labels ===
The new century brought the phenomenon of &quot;open-source&quot; or &quot;open-content&quot; record labels. These are inspired by the free software and open source movements and the success of Linux.

=== Publishers as labels ===

In the mid-2000s, some music publishing companies began undertaking the work traditionally done by labels. The publisher Sony/ATV Music, for example, leveraged its connections within the Sony family to produce, record, distribute, and promote Elliott Yamin&#x27;s debut album under a dormant Sony-owned imprint, rather than waiting for a deal with a proper label.

=== Crowdfunded labels ===
In 2002, ArtistShare was founded as the Internet&#x27;s first record label where the releases were directly funded by the artist&#x27;s fans.

<text>A ship burial or boat grave is a burial in which a ship or boat is used either as the tomb for the dead and the grave goods, or as a part of the grave goods itself. If the ship is very small, it is called a boat grave. This style of burial was practiced by various seafaring cultures in Asia and Europe. Notable ship burial practices include those by the Germanic peoples, particularly by Viking Age Norsemen, as well as the pre-colonial ship burials described in the Boxer Codex (c. 15th century) in the Philippines.

==Asia-Pacific==

=== China ===

The extinct Bo people of China&#x27;s Sichuan and Yunnan provinces are known for their hanging coffins.

The ancestors of the Bo people were instrumental in helping the Western Zhou overthrow the ruling Yin at the end of the Shang dynasty. Apart from this, the Bo people differed from other ethnic minorities in China through their burial traditions. Instead of the more common burial on the ground, the coffins of the Bo people were found hanging on cliffs. These coffins were also boat-shaped. Grave goods found in the coffins included blue and white porcelain bowls dating back to the Ming dynasty, an iron knife, another smaller knife and two iron spear points. The Bo people were massacred by the Imperial Army in the later years of the Ming dynasty, and those who survived changed their names in order to escape oppression. Scenes of the typical daily life of the Bo people can also be seen through the cliff and wall paintings they have left behind.

In the area of Sichuan several boat-shaped coffins have been found and dated to the Eastern Zhou Period (770–255 BC). The tombs also contain a large amount of ritual objects.

=== Japan ===
A boat-shaped coffin was found in Japan during the construction of the Kita Ward in Nagoya. This coffin was found to be older than any other previously found in Japan. Another boat-shaped coffin was found in the tomb of the Ohoburo Minami Kofun-gun in Northern Kyoto, dated to the latter half of the Yayoi Period (4 BC–4 AD). The tomb contained grave goods including a cobalt blue glass bangle, an iron bangle, and several iron swords. Boat-shaped coffins called haniwa were more common during the Kofun period, and these coffins were seen in paintings along with the representation of the sun, moon, and the stars. This suggests the ritual symbols associated with boats even in Japan.

=== Philippines ===
There are numerous burial sites in the Philippines that include boat burials and boat-shaped burials. In fact, present-day coffins in the Philippines still resemble canoes made from hollowed out logs. There are two famous sites of burials, the jar burials in Batanes and in Catanauan. The burial markers in Batanes are shaped like a boat, with the bow and stern appearing prominently. The markers were made from stone, and were made to appear like the outline of the traditional boat &quot;tataya&quot;. Inspection of the Chuhangin and Nakamaya sites in Batanes reveals that the markers were oriented in a Northwest-Southeast direction. Principal site investigators also discovered that the bow of the markers pointed towards the sea. But apparently, when the storms cease to pound on the islands of Batanes, the bow of the boats align with the appearance of the band of the Milky Way Galaxy. This further increases the possibility that the burials were made to align with the cosmos in the belief that the boats would carry the dead to the heavens and the stars.

Some 1500 kilometers from Batanes, the Tuhian beach in Catanauan, Quezon lies another boat-shaped burial site. The boats in Catanauan are also oriented in a Northwest-Southeast direction, with the bow pointing towards the sea. The only difference is that the markers in Batanes were made from andesite and limestone, while those present in Catanauan were made from coral slabs. Also, while the markers in Batanes contained a single burial, the Catanauan markers contained multiple burials.

The alignment of both of these burial sites served as evidence that people from both sites believed in the idea of the afterlife. Also, the boats were thought as a vessel for &quot;sailing&quot; to the heavens and the stars. This belief is a widespread idea all around the world, as we know from different burial sites all throughout Europe, the Americas and Asia.

Another burial site in Bohol was observed by the Spanish during the 16th century. One account of the burial states:

&quot;In some places, they kill slaves and bury them with their masters in order to serve them in the afterlife, this practice is carried out to the extent that many load a ship with more than sixty slaves, fill it up with food and drink, place the dead on board, and the entire vessel including live slaves buried in the earth.&quot;

Perhaps the most famous boat-shaped burial found in the Philippines is the Manunggul Jar. The jars were excavated from a Neolithic burial site in Manunggul cave of Tabon Caves at Lipuun Point at Palawan. The jars were found to be from 890–710 BC. The main feature of the Manunggul jar is the two human figures seated on a boat at the top handle of its cover. The figures represent the journey of the soul to the afterlife, with another figure serving as his oarsman.

The burial jar with a cover featuring a ship-of-the-dead […] is perhaps unrivaled in Southeast Asia; the work of an artist and master potter. This vessel provides a clear example of a cultural link between the archaeological past and the ethnographic present. The boatman […] is steering rather than paddling the &quot;ship&quot;. The mast of the boat was not recovered. Both figures appear to be wearing bands tied over the crowns of their heads and under their jaws; a pattern still found in burial practices among the indigenous peoples in the Southern Philippines. The manner in which the hands of the front figure are folded across the chest is also a widespread practice in the islands when arranging the corpse.

The carved prow and the eye motif of the spirit boat is still found on the traditional watercraft of the Sulu Archipelago, Borneo, and Malaysia. Similarities in the execution of the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth of the figures may be seen today in the wood carving of Taiwan, the Philippines, and elsewhere in Southeast Asia.

===Vietnam ===

The Dong Son culture in Vietnam is known by archaeologists due to a great concentration of boat-shaped coffins. 171 boat-shaped coffins were recovered from 44 sites in Vietnam, and most of these were found from Dong Son sites. Some of these burials included carefully arranged grave goods inside the coffin along with the corpse of the dead. Also, the coffins were found strategically close to water, either rivers or small streams of sea.

==Europe==
Ship burials were a traditional practice in Europe. Specifically, in Northern Europe, Viking ship burials are impressive finds, as they are a significant source of information about the Viking Age and the historical character of those who lived during that time. Viking ship graves were laid out in a costly fashion, and practiced for both men and women of the time.

A traditional Viking ship prepared for burial contained the body of whomever owned the ship, which would then be set on fire and laid in the water, eventually taken by the winds and tides on a journey to a new life. In Norse mythology, boats were a symbol of safe passage to the afterlife, similar to the role they played in the Vikings&#x27; lives.

The Gokstad ship, found in 1880 A unique eyewitness account of a 10th-century ship burial among the Volga Vikings is given by Arab traveller Ibn Fadlan. The largest Viking ship grave, 65 feet (20 m) long, was discovered in Norway by archeologists in 2018, and it is estimated to have been covered over 1000 years ago to be used as a boat grave for an eminent Viking king or queen.

=== Northern Europe ===

====Scandinavia====
* in Leka Municipality, Norway – a high tumulus, where (according to Snorri Sturluson) a certain King Herlaug was buried. The presumed ship burial is the earliest in Scandinavia, dated by dendrochronology to ca. 700 AD.
* Ladby – from Kerteminde on the island of Funen, Denmark
* Gokstad – from Kongshaugen, Vestfold, Norway
* Oseberg – from Oseberg farm near Tønsberg in Vestfold, Norway
* Tune – from Haugen farm on Rolvsøy in Tune Municipality, Østfold, Norway
* Gjellestad – from the farm of the same name in Halden Municipality, Norway; excavations ongoing as of June 2020.

The Gokstad Ship burial– from Kongshaugen, Vestfold, Norway, discovered in 1880, is the largest preserved Viking ships in Norway. The ship was found by archeologist Nicolay Nicolaysen, who had discovered an unsanctioned archeological dig endeavor on Gokstad farm, which the two sons of the owner of the farm&#x27;s owner were responsible for. When Nicolaysen&#x27;s team arrived at the site, they soon began a state-sponsored excavation. It only took two days for part of the boat&#x27;s wooden structure to surface, revealing what would be one of the most remarkable Viking archeological discoveries ever made.

The ship measures an astonishing 76 by 17.5 feet, with a mast, fittings for one large sail, and its outside embellished by altering black and yellow shields. Inside, a chieftain was found in a burial chamber within the ships mast, surrounded by a variety of spectacular group of objects placed with the intention of providing relaxation and enjoyment in his journey to the afterlife. Additionally, the archeologists discovered the remains of different animals buried within, such as horses, dogs, peacocks, and goshawks. Dendrochronology suggests that the wood used for the ship was cut down in around 890. The ship is spacious, with a full deck across its interior, and is large enough for a crew of thirty to forty men.Another well preserved viking ship, The Oseberg Ship– from Oseberg farm near Tønsberg in Vestfold, Norway, was found in 1904 by Gabriel Gustafson . The burial was covered with a 40 meter wide and more than 6 meter high mound of stone, clay and turf, and consisted of a 21.5 meter long ship with a tent-shaped, timber-built and 5.6 meter long burial chamber erected immediately aft of amidships. The ship and grave goods are unusually well preserved because of the blue clay in which it was buried. 

In the early Middle Ages, robbers broke into the mound and reached the burial chamber, leaving the grave disturbed by the time archeologists discovered it in 1904. However, most of the rich equipment was preserved and found in the forefront of the ship, including: three beds, two tents, a richly decorated cart, three sleighs and a work sled, and elegantly carved sleigh shafts. Additionally, the skeletons of at least 10 horses and an ox were found. The Oseberg Ship burial is one of the few ship burials for women, and the two individuals found were thought to have been 50 and 80 years old.Some of the personal possessions of the women were also discovered, such as implements for textile work, chests, and four intricately carved animal heads.

<doc id="147107" wikidata="Q2619535" url="?curid=147107" title="Revolution (Beatles song)">
<text>&quot;Revolution&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, written by John Lennon and credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership. Three versions of the song were recorded and released in 1968, all during sessions for the Beatles&#x27; self-titled double album, also known as the &quot;White Album&quot;: a slow, bluesy arrangement (&quot;Revolution 1&quot;) included on the album; an abstract sound collage (titled &quot;Revolution 9&quot;) that originated as the latter part of &quot;Revolution 1&quot; and appears on the same album; and the faster, hard rock version similar to &quot;Revolution 1&quot;, released as the B-side of &quot;Hey Jude&quot;. Although the single version was issued first, it was recorded several weeks after &quot;Revolution 1&quot;, intended for release as a single. A music video for the song was shot using the backing track from the single version, their appearances reflecting the song&#x27;s atmosphere, along with live-sung lyrics that more closely resemble the album version.

Inspired by political protests in early 1968, Lennon&#x27;s lyrics expressed sympathy with the need for social change but doubt in regard to the violent tactics espoused by some members of the New Left. Despite his bandmates&#x27; reservations, he persevered with the song and insisted it be included on their next single. When released in August, the song was viewed by the political left as a betrayal of their cause and a sign that the Beatles were out of step with radical elements of the counterculture. The release of &quot;Revolution 1&quot; in November indicated Lennon&#x27;s uncertainty about destructive change, with the phrase &quot;count me out&quot; recorded instead as &quot;count me out – in&quot;. Lennon was stung by the criticism he received from the New Left and subsequently espoused the need for Marxist revolution, particularly with his 1971 single &quot;Power to the People&quot;. However, in one of the final interviews he gave before his death in 1980, he reaffirmed the pacifist sentiments expressed in &quot;Revolution&quot;.

&quot;Revolution&quot; reached number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the US and topped singles charts in Australia and New Zealand. &quot;Revolution&quot; has received praise from music critics, particularly for the intensity of the performance and the heavily distorted guitar sound. In 1987, the song became the first Beatles recording to be licensed for a television commercial, which prompted a lawsuit from the surviving members of the group. The song has been covered by numerous artists, including Thompson Twins, who performed it at Live Aid in July 1985, and Stone Temple Pilots.
==Background and composition==
In early 1968, media coverage in the aftermath of the Tet Offensive spurred increased protests in opposition to the Vietnam War, especially among university students. The protests were most prevalent in the United States, and on 17 March, 25,000 demonstrators marched to the American embassy in London&#x27;s Grosvenor Square and violently clashed with police.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burley/Independent&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Major protests concerning other political issues made international news, such as the March 1968 protests in Poland against their communist government, and the campus uprisings of May 1968 in France. The upheaval reflected the increased politicisation of the 1960s youth movement and the rise of New Left ideology, in a contrast with the hippie ideology behind the 1967 Summer of Love. For these students and activists, the Maoist idea of cultural revolution, purging society of its non-progressive elements, provided a model for social change.

By and large, the Beatles had avoided publicly expressing their political views in their music, with &quot;Taxman&quot; being their only overtly political track thus far. Viewed as leaders of the counterculture, the band – particularly John Lennon – were under pressure from Leninist, Trotskyist and Maoist groups to actively support the revolutionary cause. Lennon decided to write a song about the recent wave of social upheaval while the Beatles were in Rishikesh, India, studying Transcendental Meditation. He recalled, &quot;I thought it was about time we spoke about it, the same as I thought it was about time we stopped not answering about the Vietnamese war [in 1966]. I had been thinking about it up in the hills in India.&quot; Lennon began writing the song there and completed it in England in May, inspired especially by events in France.
Despite Lennon&#x27;s antiwar feelings, he had yet to become anti-establishment, and expressed in &quot;Revolution&quot; that he wanted &quot;to see the plan&quot; from those advocating toppling the system. In author Mark Hertsgaard&#x27;s description, the lyrics advocate social change but emphasise that &quot;political actions [should] be judged on moral rather than ideological grounds&quot;. The repeated phrase &quot;it&#x27;s gonna be alright&quot; came directly from Lennon&#x27;s Transcendental Meditation experiences in India, conveying the idea that God would take care of the human race no matter what happened politically. Another influence on Lennon was his burgeoning relationship with avant-garde artist Yoko Ono and her espousal of sexual politics as an alternative to Maoist ideas and other hardline philosophies adopted by the political left. Lennon credited Ono with awakening him from his passive mindset of the previous year.

Around the fourth week of May 1968, the Beatles met at Kinfauns, George Harrison&#x27;s home in Esher, to demonstrate their compositions to each other in preparation for recording their next studio album. A recording from that informal session released in the White Album&#x27;s Super Deluxe version shows that &quot;Revolution&quot; had two of its three verses intact. The lines referencing Mao Zedong – &quot;But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao / You ain&#x27;t gone make it with anyone anyhow&quot; – were added in the studio. While filming a promotional clip later that year, Lennon told director Michael Lindsay-Hogg that it was the most important lyric in the song. By 1972, Lennon had changed his mind, saying: &quot;I should have never said that about Chairman Mao.&quot;
==Recording==
===&quot;Revolution 1&quot;===
The Beatles began the recording sessions for their new album on 30 May, starting with &quot;Revolution 1&quot; (simply titled &quot;Revolution&quot; for the first few sessions). At this first session, they concentrated on recording the basic rhythm track. Take 18 lasted 10:17, much longer than the earlier takes, and it was this take that was chosen for additional overdubs recorded over the next two sessions. The full take 18 was officially released in 2018, as part of the Super Deluxe Edition of &quot;The Beatles&quot; coinciding with the album&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary.

During overdubs which brought the recording to take 20, Lennon took the unusual step of performing his lead vocal while lying on the floor. He also altered one line into the ambiguous &quot;you can count me out, in&quot;. He later explained that he included both because he was undecided in his sentiments.
&quot;Revolution 1&quot; has a blues style, performed at a relaxed tempo. The basic time signature is (or in a &quot;shuffle&quot; style), but the song has several extra half-length bars during the verses. There are also two extra beats at the end of the last chorus, the result of an accidental bad edit during the mixing process that was left uncorrected at Lennon&#x27;s request.

====Take 20====
Monitor mixes of the full-length version of &quot;Revolution 1&quot; became available on bootlegs such as &quot;From Kinfauns to Chaos&quot; in the 1990s. In 2009, a high-quality version labelled &quot;Revolution Take 20&quot; appeared on the bootleg CD &quot;Revolution: Take ... Your Knickers Off!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Krepps/RS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The release triggered considerable interest among the media and fans of the group. This version, RM1 (Remix in Mono #1) of take 20, runs to 10 minutes 46 seconds (at the correct speed) and was created at the end of the 4 June session, with a copy taken away by Lennon. It was an attempt by Lennon to augment the full-length version of &quot;Revolution&quot; in a way that satisfied him before he chose to split the piece between the edited &quot;Revolution 1&quot; and the &quot;musique concrète&quot; &quot;Revolution 9&quot;.

The bootlegged recording starts with engineer Peter Bown announcing the remix as &quot;RM1 of Take ...&quot; and then momentarily forgetting the take number, which Lennon jokingly finishes with &quot;Take your knickers off and let&#x27;s go!&quot; The first half of the recording is almost identical to the released track &quot;Revolution 1&quot;. It lacks the electric guitar and horn overdubs of the final version, but features two tape loops in the key of A (same as the song) that are faded in and out at various points. After the final chorus, the song launches into an extended coda similar to that in &quot;Hey Jude&quot;. (The album version only features about 40 seconds of this coda.) Beyond the point where the album version fades out, the basic instrumental backing keeps repeating while the vocals and overdubs become increasingly chaotic: Harrison and Paul McCartney repeatedly sing &quot;dada, mama&quot; in a childlike register; Lennon&#x27;s histrionic vocals are randomly distorted in speed (a little of this can be heard in the fade of &quot;Revolution 1&quot;); and radio tuning noises à la &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; appear. Several elements of this coda appear in the officially released &quot;Revolution 9&quot;.

After the band track ends, the song moves into avant-garde territory, with Yoko Ono reciting some prose over a portion of the song &quot;Awal Hamsa&quot; by Farid al-Atrash (captured from the studio recording). Ono&#x27;s piece begins with the words &quot;Maybe, it&#x27;s not that ...&quot;, with her voice trailing off at the end; McCartney jokingly replies, &quot;It &quot;is&quot; &#x27;that&#x27;!&quot; As the piece continues, Lennon quietly mumbles &quot;Gonna be alright&quot; a few times. Then follows a brief piano riff, some comments from Lennon and Ono on how well the track has proceeded, and final appearances of the tape loops. Most of this coda was lifted for the end of &quot;Revolution 9&quot;, with a little more piano at the beginning (which monitor mixes reveal was present in earlier mixes of &quot;Revolution&quot;) and minus Lennon&#x27;s (or Harrison&#x27;s) joking reply.

====Splitting of &quot;Revolution 1&quot; and &quot;Revolution 9&quot;====

Lennon soon decided to divide the existing ten-minute recording into two parts: a more conventional Beatles track and an avant-garde sound collage. Within days after take 20, work began on &quot;Revolution 9&quot; using the last six minutes of the take as a starting point. Numerous sound effects, tape loops, and overdubs were recorded and compiled over several sessions almost exclusively by Lennon and Ono, although Harrison provided assistance for spoken overdubs. With more than 40 sources used for &quot;Revolution 9&quot;, only small portions of the take 20 coda are heard in the final mix; most prominent from take 20 are Lennon&#x27;s multiple screams of &quot;right&quot; and &quot;alright&quot;, and around a minute near the end featuring Ono&#x27;s lines up to &quot;you become naked&quot;.

On 21 June, the first part of take 20 received several overdubs and became officially titled &quot;Revolution 1&quot;. The overdubs included a lead guitar line by Harrison and a brass section of two trumpets and four trombones. Final stereo mixing was completed on 25 June. The final mix that would ultimately be included on the &quot;White Album&quot; included the hurried announcement of &quot;take two&quot; by Geoff Emerick at the beginning of the song.

===Single version===
Lennon wanted &quot;Revolution 1&quot; to be the next Beatles single, but McCartney was reluctant to invite controversy, and argued along with Harrison that the track was too slow for a single. Lennon persisted, and rehearsals for a faster and louder remake began on 9 July. Recording started the following day. Writing in 2014, music journalist Ian Fortnam paired &quot;Revolution&quot; with the White Album track &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; as the Beatles&#x27; two &quot;proto-metal experiment[s]&quot; of 1968.
The song begins with &quot;a startling machine-gun fuzz guitar riff&quot;, according to music critic Richie Unterberger, with Lennon and Harrison&#x27;s guitars prominent throughout the track.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unterberger/AM&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Paul McCartney, it was played on &quot;a bit of a cheap Gibson&quot;, a hollowbody guitar with a laminated maple top that gave it some bite and warmth. The distorted sound was achieved by direct injection of the guitar signal into the mixing console. Emerick later explained that he routed the signal through two microphone preamplifiers in series while keeping the amount of overload just below the point of overheating the console. This was such a severe abuse of the studio equipment that Emerick thought, &quot;If I was the studio manager and saw this going on, I&#x27;d fire myself.&quot; Lennon overdubbed the opening scream, and double-tracked some of the words &quot;so roughly that its careless spontaneity becomes a point in itself&quot;, according to author Ian MacDonald.

&quot;Revolution&quot; was performed in a higher key, B major, compared to the A major of &quot;Revolution 1&quot;. The &quot;shoo-bee-do-wop&quot; backing vocals were omitted in the remake, and an instrumental break was added. &quot;Revolution&quot; was given a climactic ending, as opposed to the fade out of &quot;Revolution 1&quot;. For this version, Lennon unequivocally sang &quot;count me out&quot;. An electric piano overdub by Nicky Hopkins was added on 11 July, with final overdubs taking place on 13 July and mono mixing on 15 July.

Despite Lennon&#x27;s efforts, McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was selected as the A-side of the band&#x27;s next single. Having sought to reassert his leadership of the Beatles over McCartney, Lennon reluctantly agreed to have &quot;Revolution&quot; demoted to the B-side.

==Release==
The &quot;Hey Jude&quot; / &quot;Revolution&quot; single was issued on 26 August 1968 in the US, with the UK release taking place on 30 August. Two days after the record&#x27;s US release, violent scenes occurred at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, as police and National Guardsmen were filmed clubbing Vietnam War protestors. This event came two months after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, the Democratic presidential nominee who had pledged to end America&#x27;s involvement in Vietnam, and coincided with further militant action in Europe. According to author Jonathan Gould, this combination ensured that, contrary to Lennon&#x27;s doubts about the song&#x27;s relevance, Revolution&#x27; had been rendered all &quot;too&quot; relevant by the onrushing tide of events.&quot;

The single was the band&#x27;s first release on Apple Records, their EMI-distributed record label. As part of their Apple Corps business enterprise, the label was run on counterculture principles and intended to be a form of what McCartney termed &quot;Western communism&quot;. The single was one of the four records that were sent in gift-wrapped boxes, marked &quot;Our First Four&quot;, to Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the royal family, and to Harold Wilson, the British prime minister. According to music journalist Jim Irvin, the heavily distorted sound of &quot;Revolution&quot; led some record buyers to return their copies, in the belief that &quot;there was bad surface noise&quot; on the disc. Irvin recalled of his own experience: &quot;The exasperated [shop] assistant explained, for the umpteenth time that Saturday, &#x27;It&#x27;s &quot;supposed&quot; to sound like that. We&#x27;ve checked with EMI ...

&quot;Hey Jude&quot; topped sales charts around the world, while &quot;Revolution&quot; was a highly popular B-side. In the US, where each side of a single continued to be listed individually, it peaked at number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number 11 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 100, and number 2 on &quot;Record World&quot;″s chart. The latter peak was achieved while &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was at number 1. The single was listed as a double-sided number 1 in Australia, while &quot;Revolution&quot; topped New Zealand&#x27;s singles chart for one week, following &quot;Hey Judes five-week run at number 1 there.

&quot;Revolution 1&quot; was released on &quot;The Beatles&quot; on 22 November 1968. It was the opening track on side four of the LP, four spots ahead of the companion piece &quot;Revolution 9&quot;. In an interview following the album&#x27;s release, Harrison said that &quot;Revolution 1&quot; &quot;has less attack and not as much revolution&quot; as the single B-side, and described it as &quot;the Glenn Miller version&quot;. The lyric sheet included with the original LP carried the words &quot;count me out&quot;, without the appended &quot;in&quot;.

==Promotional film==
Filming for promotional clips of &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and &quot;Revolution&quot; took place on 4 September 1968 under the direction of Michael Lindsay-Hogg. Two finished clips of &quot;Revolution&quot; were produced, with only lighting differences and other minor variations. The Beatles sang the vocals live over the pre-recorded instrumental track from the single version. Their vocals included elements from &quot;Revolution 1&quot;: McCartney and Harrison sang the &quot;shoo-bee-doo-wop&quot; backing vocals, and Lennon sang &quot;count me out – in&quot;. Authors Bruce Spizer and John Winn each describe the performance as &quot;exciting&quot;. According to Spizer, it &quot;combines the best elements of the album and single versions&quot;, while Hertsgaard writes that, two years after the band had retired from public performances, the clip proved that &quot;the Beatles could rock with the best of them&quot;.
Lindsay-Hogg recalled of the Beatles&#x27; approach to their promotion films: &quot;Society was changing and music was in the vanguard. The appearance of the musicians, their clothes, hair, their way of talking was stirring the pot of social revolution.&quot; For Lennon, his absorption in a romantic and creative partnership with Ono was reflected in a change of appearance and image. In Fortnam&#x27;s description, a &quot;lean, mean demeanour&quot; had replaced Lennon&#x27;s &quot;moptop-era puppy fat&quot;, while Hertsgaard says the clip presented him as &quot;a serious longhair ... his center-parted locks falling down to his shoulders, and both his vocals and his subject matter further underlined how far he had traveled since the moptop days&quot;. Lindsay-Hogg recalled that before filming &quot;Revolution&quot;, Lennon looked the worse for wear, yet he turned down a suggestion that he apply some stage makeup to make him appear healthier. Lennon reasoned, &quot;Because I&#x27;m John Lennon&quot; – a point Lindsay-Hogg cites as demonstrating that &quot;They had a very different attitude to most stars. They were authentic, they weren&#x27;t characters in a fiction.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McCormick/DT&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the clip, Lennon plays his Epiphone Casino guitar, which he had recently stripped back from its sunburst pattern to a plain white finish. MacDonald says this gesture was partly indicative of Lennon&#x27;s desire for &quot;deglamourised frankness&quot; and that the song inaugurates Lennon&#x27;s adoption of the &quot;stripped Casino&quot; as a &quot;key part of his image&quot;.

While the &quot;Hey Jude&quot; clip debuted on David Frost&#x27;s show &quot;Frost on Sunday&quot;, on the ITV network, the &quot;Revolution&quot; clip was first broadcast on the BBC1 programme &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 19 September 1968. The first US screening of &quot;Revolution&quot; was on the 6 October broadcast of &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;. The latter show was frequently subjected to censorship by its network, CBS, for its anti-establishment views, political satire and commentary on the Vietnam War. In choosing &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; over more mainstream shows such as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, the Beatles ensured that their single reached an audience aligned with countercultural ideology.

==Critical reception==
In his contemporary review of the single, for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Chris Welch praised the A-side, saying it was a track that took several listens before its full appeal became evident, but he dismissed &quot;Revolution&quot; as &quot;a fuzzy mess, and best forgotten&quot;. More impressed, Derek Johnson of the &quot;NME&quot; described &quot;Revolution&quot; as &quot;unashamed rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot; but &quot;a cut above the average rock disc, particularly in the thoughtful and highly topical lyric&quot;, and &quot;a track that literally shimmers with excitement and awareness&quot;. Johnson concluded by stating that the two sides &quot;prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Beatles are still streets ahead of their rivals&quot;. &quot;Cash Box&quot;″s reviewer described &quot;Revolution&quot; as &quot;straight-out rock with lyrical flavor of a pre-Revolver feel and fifties-rock instrumentation&quot;, adding: &quot;More commercial at first few hearings, but hardly able to stand up against &#x27;Hey Jude.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine devoted an article to discussing &quot;Revolution&quot;, the first time in the magazine&#x27;s history that it had done so for a pop song. The writers said the song was &quot;exhilarating hard rock&quot; directed at &quot;radical activists the world over&quot;, and that its message would &quot;surprise some, disappoint others, and move many: cool it&quot;. Dave Marsh featured &quot;Revolution&quot; in his 1989 book covering the 1001 greatest singles, describing it as a &quot;gem&quot; with a &quot;ferocious fuzztone rock and roll attack&quot; and a &quot;snarling&quot; Lennon vocal. Writing for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham includes &quot;Revolution&quot; in his list of the essential Beatles songs and calls it a &quot;remarkably cogent&quot; statement. He says that whereas &quot;Revolution 1&quot; resembles a &quot;stoned, bluesy jam&quot;, the vibrant quality of the single version &quot;has the effect of making [Lennon&#x27;s] flower-proffering pacifism a dynamic option, rather than a soporifically waved white flag&quot;. In his song review for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger calls &quot;Revolution&quot; one of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;greatest, most furious rockers&quot; with &quot;challenging, fiery lyrics&quot; where the listener&#x27;s &quot;heart immediately starts pounding before Lennon goes into the first verse&quot;.

In 2006, &quot;Mojo&quot; placed &quot;Revolution&quot; at number 16 on its list of &quot;The 101 Greatest Beatles Songs&quot;. In his commentary for the magazine, Pete Shelley of the punk band the Buzzcocks recalled that he had never heard such distorted guitar sounds before, and hearing the song was his &quot;eureka moment&quot; when he decided he wanted to be in a band. The track was ranked at number 13 in a similar list compiled by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2010.

==Cultural responses==

Until the events of summer 1968, political activists and far left publications in the US distanced themselves from rock music and had no expectations of its relevance to their cause. According to the historian Jon Wiener, &quot;Revolution&quot; inspired the first &quot;serious debate&quot; about the connection between politics and 1960s rock music. The counterculture&#x27;s reaction was especially informed by news footage of the violent scenes outside the Democratic National Convention on 28 August, and of Soviet tanks invading Czechoslovakia, which marked the return of Soviet-style communism and the end of the Prague Spring. The song prompted immediate responses from the New Left and counterculture press, most of whom expressed disappointment in the Beatles. Radicals were shocked by Lennon&#x27;s use of sarcasm, his contention that things would be &quot;all right&quot;, and his failure to engage with their plight. They also objected to his requirement for a &quot;plan&quot; for the revolution, when their aim was to liberate minds and ensure that all individuals entered the decision-making process as a means of personal expression. &quot;Ramparts&quot; branded the song a &quot;betrayal&quot; of the cause and the &quot;Berkeley Barb&quot; likened it to &quot;the hawk plank adopted this week in the Chicago convention of the Democratic Death Party&quot;. In Britain, the &quot;New Left Review&quot; derided the song as &quot;a lamentable petty bourgeois cry of fear&quot;, while &quot;Black Dwarf&quot; said it showed the Beatles to be &quot;the consciousness of the enemies of the revolution&quot;. The far left contrasted &quot;Revolution&quot; with the Rolling Stones&#x27; concurrent single, &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot;, which Mick Jagger had been inspired to write after attending the violent rally at Grosvenor Square in March. Despite the ambiguity in Jagger&#x27;s lyrics, &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; was perceived to be supportive of a radical agenda.
The approval from &quot;Time&quot; magazine – a mainstream publication widely viewed as reflecting establishment views – added to the song&#x27;s lack of credibility among the far left. Other commentators on the left applauded the Beatles for rejecting radicalism governed by hatred and violence, and for advocating &quot;pacifist idealism&quot;. Among these, the New Left Students for a Democratic Society&#x27;s newspaper at Cornell University stated that &quot;You can argue about effectiveness of non-violence as a tactic, but it would be absurd to claim that it is a conservative notion ... The Beatles want to change the world, and they are doing what they can.&quot; With the release of &quot;Revolution 1&quot; three months after the single, some student radicals – unaware of the chronology of the recordings – welcomed the &quot;count me out, in&quot; lyric as a sign that Lennon had partly retracted his objection to Maoist revolution. According to author Mark Kurlansky, although student activists returned to their colleges after the long summer break motivated to continue the struggle, for many other people, a &quot;feeling of weariness&quot; supplanted their interest, and &quot;by the end of 1968 many people agreed with the Beatles&quot;.

Among the political right, William F. Buckley Jr, an arch-conservative, wrote approvingly of the song, only to then be rebuked by the far-right John Birch Society&#x27;s magazine. The magazine&#x27;s editors warned that, rather than denouncing revolution, &quot;Revolution&quot; was urging Maoists not to &quot;blow it all&quot; through their impatience and was espousing a Lenin-inspired, &quot;Moscow line&quot;. In reaction to the song and to Lennon and Ono&#x27;s performance art activities, the British authorities withdrew the protection they had long afforded the Beatles as MBEs. On 18 October, Lennon and Ono were arrested on charges of drug possession; Lennon maintained he had been warned of the raid and that the drugs were planted by the arresting officers from the London Drug Squad.
Rock critics also entered the political debate over &quot;Revolution&quot;, whereas politics had rarely been a subject of interest in their field before 1968. Greil Marcus commented that political detractors of &quot;Revolution&quot; had overlooked the &quot;message&quot; of the music, &quot;which is more powerful than anyone&#x27;s words&quot;. He added: &quot;There is freedom and movement in the music even as there is sterility and repression in the lyrics. The music doesn&#x27;t say &#x27;cool it&#x27; or &#x27;don&#x27;t fight the cops&#x27; ... the music dodges the message and comes out in front.&quot; Ellen Willis of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that the Rolling Stones understood the &quot;ambiguous relation of rock to rebellion&quot;, but &quot;It takes a lot of chutzpah for a multimillionaire to assure the rest of us, &#x27;You know it&#x27;s gonna be all right&#x27; ... Deep within John Lennon there&#x27;s a fusty old Tory struggling to get out.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor Jann Wenner wholeheartedly supported the Beatles, saying that any accusations of &quot;revolutionary heresy&quot; were &quot;absurd&quot;, since the band were being &quot;absolutely true to their identity as it has evolved through the last six years&quot;. In his review of the White Album, Wenner added: &quot;Rock and roll has indeed become a style and a vehicle for changing the system. But one of the parts of the system to be changed is &#x27;politics&#x27; and this includes &#x27;new Left&#x27; politics.&quot;

The Beatles&#x27; apoliticism was attacked by the French film-maker Jean-Luc Godard, who had recently made the film &quot;One Plus One&quot; in London with the Rolling Stones. In an interview for &quot;International Times&quot; in September 1968, Godard said the Beatles were an example of people in Britain who had been &quot;corrupted by money&quot;. Soon afterwards, Lennon told Jonathan Cott of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that this criticism was &quot;sour grapes&quot; on the director&#x27;s part, since Godard had been unable to get the band to appear in &quot;One Plus One&quot; and so had approached the Stones. On her arrival in London in December, the American singer Nina Simone was quoted as saying she wanted to &quot;know what the message is&quot; in &quot;Revolution&quot; so that she could perform the song effectively in concert. Instead, she wrote and recorded an answer song, also titled &quot;Revolution&quot;, partly based on Lennon&#x27;s composition. In her lyrics, she challenged Lennon&#x27;s statements about destruction and &quot;the constitution&quot;, and urged him to &quot;clean&quot; his brain.
===Lennon&#x27;s reaction===

Challenged on his political stance, Lennon exchanged open letters with John Hoyland, a student radical from Keele University, in the pages of &quot;Black Dwarf&quot;. Hoyland wrote the first letter in late October 1968, expecting that Lennon&#x27;s drugs bust and the intolerance shown towards Ono, as a Japanese woman in Britain, would make him more sympathetic to a radical agenda. Hoyland said that &quot;Revolution&quot; was &quot;no more revolutionary&quot; than the radio soap opera &quot;Mrs Dale&#x27;s Diary&quot; and criticised Lennon for continuing to espouse an ideology the Beatles had expressed in &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; when, in the context of 1968, &quot;In order to change the world we&#x27;ve got to understand what&#x27;s wrong with the world. And then – destroy it. Ruthlessly.&quot;

Before writing a reply, Lennon met with two other students from Keele University at his home in Surrey, on 3 December. Referring to Hoyland&#x27;s letter, he said that a destructive approach to societal change merely makes way for a destructive ruling power, citing the Russian and French revolutions; he also said that the Far Left&#x27;s complaints demonstrated their &quot;extremer than thou&quot; snobbery and their inability to form a united movement, adding that if radicals of that calibre did lead a revolution, he and the Rolling Stones would &quot;probably be the first ones they&#x27;ll shoot ... And it&#x27;s him – it&#x27;s the guy that wrote the letter that&#x27;ll do it, you know.&quot; In his letter published in &quot;Black Dwarf&quot; on 10 January 1969, Lennon countered that Hoyland was &quot;on a destruction kick&quot; and challenged him to name a single revolution that had achieved its aims. Lennon closed the letter with a postscript saying, &quot;You smash it – and I&#x27;ll build around it.&quot; The exchange, which included a second letter from Hoyland, was syndicated internationally in the underground press. &quot;Oz&quot; editor Richard Neville later described it as &quot;a classic New Left/psychedelic Left dialogue&quot;.

Lennon was stung by the criticism he received from the New Left. Having campaigned for world peace with Ono throughout 1969, he began to embrace radical politics after undergoing primal therapy in 1970. In a conversation with British activist Tariq Ali in January 1971, he said of &quot;Revolution&quot;: &quot;I made a mistake, you know. The mistake was that it was anti-revolution.&quot; Lennon then wrote &quot;Power to the People&quot; to atone for the perceived apathy of &quot;Revolution&quot;, and instead sang: &quot;You say you want a revolution / We better get it on right away.&quot; After moving to New York in 1971, he and Ono fully embraced radical politics with Chicago Seven defendants Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman. Lennon abandoned the cause following Richard Nixon&#x27;s victory in the 1972 presidential election and he subsequently denounced revolutionaries and radical politics as useless. In the final interview he gave before his murder in December 1980, Lennon reaffirmed the pacifist message of &quot;Revolution&quot;, saying he still wished to &quot;see the plan&quot; for any proposed revolution. With reference to Lennon&#x27;s comments in this interview, MacDonald wrote in 1994: &quot;Tiananmen Square, the ignominious collapse of Soviet communism, and the fact that most of his radical persecutors of 1968–70 now work in advertising have belatedly served to confirm his original instincts.&quot;

==Subsequent releases and use in Nike advertisement==
&quot;Revolution&quot; made its LP debut on the 1970 US compilation album &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, which was also the first time that the track was available in stereo. The stereo mix was carried out on 5 December 1969, supervised by Martin. The song was subsequently issued on the Beatles compilations &quot;1967–1970&quot; and &quot;Past Masters, Volume Two&quot;. Lennon disliked the stereo mix used on &quot;1967–1970&quot;, saying in a 1974 interview that &quot;Revolution&quot; was a &quot;heavy record&quot; in mono but &quot;then they made it into a piece of ice cream!&quot; The song was included as the opening track of the Beatles&#x27; 2012 iTunes compilation &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, which the band&#x27;s website described as a collection of &quot;the Beatles&#x27; most influential rock songs&quot;.

In 1987, &quot;Revolution&quot; became the first Beatles recording to be licensed for use in a television commercial. Nike paid $500,000 for the right to use the song for one year, split between recording owner Capitol-EMI and song publisher ATV Music Publishing (owned by Michael Jackson). Commercials using the song started airing in March 1987.

The three surviving Beatles, through Apple Corps, filed a lawsuit in July objecting to Nike&#x27;s use of the song. The suit was aimed at Nike, its advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy, and Capitol-EMI Records. Capitol-EMI said the lawsuit was groundless because they had licensed the use of &quot;Revolution&quot; with the &quot;active support and encouragement of Yoko Ono Lennon, a shareholder and director of Apple&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doyle/PHD&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Ono had expressed approval when the ad was released, saying it was &quot;making John&#x27;s music accessible to a new generation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pareles/NYT&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Fans were outraged at Nike&#x27;s appropriation of the song and incensed at Jackson and Ono for allowing the Beatles&#x27; work to be commercially exploited in this way. Ono said that McCartney had agreed to the deal, a claim that McCartney denied. Harrison commented in an interview for &quot;Musician&quot; magazine:
Well, from our point of view, if it&#x27;s allowed to happen, every Beatles song ever recorded is going to be advertising women&#x27;s underwear and sausages. We&#x27;ve got to put a stop to it in order to set a precedent. Otherwise it&#x27;s going to be a free-for-all ... It&#x27;s one thing when you&#x27;re dead, but we&#x27;re still around! They don&#x27;t have any respect for the fact that we wrote and recorded those songs, and it was our lives.

The &quot;Revolution&quot; lawsuit and others involving the Beatles and EMI were settled out of court in November 1989, with the terms kept secret. The financial website TheStreet.com included the Nike &quot;Revolution&quot; advertisement campaign in its list of the 100 key business events of the 20th century, as it helped &quot;commodify dissent&quot;.

== Cover versions ==
=== Thompson Twins ===

The English pop band Thompson Twins recorded &quot;Revolution&quot; for their fifth studio album &quot;Here&#x27;s to Future Days&quot; (1985), which was co-produced by Nile Rodgers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lent/HR&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 July that year, in advance of the album&#x27;s release, the band performed the song with Rodgers,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fulton/DR&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Madonna and guitarist Steve Stevens at the concert held at JFK Stadium in Philadelphia that formed the US part of Live Aid. The concert was watched by a television audience estimated at 1.5 billion and raised $80 million for African famine relief. In a 2017 interview, Thompson Twins singer Tom Bailey said that, having grown up in the 1960s when music was &quot;about social change and making the world a better place&quot;, he now believed that it had become &quot;tamed by the corporate world&quot; and Live Aid represented &quot;the last great moment of rock and roll fist waving for change&quot;.

&quot;Revolution&quot; was one of three tracks on &quot;Here&#x27;s to Future Days&quot; to feature Stevens on guitar and was first released in September 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas/NightFlight&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently issued as a single, backed by the non-album instrumental &quot;The Fourth Sunday&quot;. The band made a promotional video for the single, directed by Meiert Avis. The song peaked at number 56 on the UK Singles Chart, spending five weeks on the chart. In 2004, the Live Aid performance of the song was included on the four-disc DVD release from the event.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beets/AustinChronicle&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stone Temple Pilots===

In October 2001, the rock band Stone Temple Pilots performed &quot;Revolution&quot; live during &quot;Come Together: A Night for John Lennon&#x27;s Words and Music&quot;, a television special in tribute to Lennon that raised funds for victims of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. Singer Scott Weiland said that the band had selected the song while on tour in Europe, several weeks before &quot;Come Together&quot;; he added: &quot;Our real decision for picking &#x27;Revolution&#x27; was simply because it rocks.&quot; After their performance received considerable radio airplay, Stone Temple Pilots recorded a studio version of the song, which was released as a single on 27 November 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiederhorn/MTV&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The song also appeared as a b-side to the band&#x27;s previous single &quot;Hollywood Bitch&quot;. The single reached number 30 on the US Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, was the 77th best-selling single in Canada for 2002, and the 90th best in 2001.
===Other artists===
Along with White Album tracks such as &quot;Revolution 9&quot;, &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; and &quot;Piggies&quot;, &quot;Revolution 1&quot; was interpreted by Californian cult leader Charles Manson as a prophecy of an upcoming apocalyptic racial war between the establishment and the Black community that would leave him and his followers, the Manson Family, to rule America on counterculture principles. In an attempt to initiate this revolution, the Family carried out a series of murders in Los Angeles in August 1969. For the soundtrack of the 1976 TV film &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, &quot;Revolution 1&quot; was performed by the band Silverspoon.

&quot;Revolution&quot; has also been covered by Anima Sound System, Billy Bragg, the Brothers Four, Enuff Z&#x27;nuff, Jools Holland, Kajsa Grytt, Kenny Neal, Reckless Kelly, Hawksley Workman, Stereophonics, Jim Sturgess, Running Wild and Trixter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fontenot/About&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a cover version of the song was featured in the Universal comedy &quot;Evan Almighty&quot; performed by country rock band Rascal Flatts.

<text>Kragujevac (, ) is the fourth largest city in Serbia and the administrative centre of the Šumadija District. It is the historical centre of the geographical region of Šumadija in central Serbia, and is situated on the banks of the Lepenica River. According to the 2022 census, City of Kragujevac has 171,186 inhabitants.

Kragujevac was the first capital of modern Serbia and the first constitution in the Balkans, the Sretenje Constitution, was proclaimed in the city in 1835. A unit of the Scottish Women&#x27;s Hospitals for Foreign Service was located there in World War I. During the Second World War, Kragujevac was the site of a massacre by the Nazis in which 2,778 Serb men and boys were killed.

Modern Kragujevac is known for its large munitions (Zastava Arms) and automobile (Fiat Serbia) industries, as well as its status as an education centre housing the University of Kragujevac, one of the region&#x27;s largest higher education institutions.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Kragujevac&quot; comes from &#x27;kraguj&#x27; the Serbian name for cinereous vulture. In the Middle Ages, this bird was common in the woods of the area, and was used for hunting. The city&#x27;s name means &#x27;kraguj&#x27;s tower&#x27;, and the bird is represented on the city&#x27;s coat of arms.

==History==
===Early and medieval===
Over 200 archaeological sites in Šumadija confirm that the region&#x27;s first human settlement took place around 40,000 years ago during the Paleolithic era. The Jerina cave, located near the village of Gradac in the direction of Batočina, is dated to have been inhabited from around 37,000 BP to 27,000 BP. Dugouts dated to 5,000 BC have been found in the city&#x27;s vicinity, in the localities of Grivac, Kusovac, Divostin, Donje Grbice and Dobrovodica. These remains belong to the Neolithic Starčevo culture, which, in this area, spread along the river valleys of Lepenica and Gruža. The best known artifacts are the fertility figurines called &quot;Divostinke&quot; (&quot;Girls from Divostin&quot;).

At the time of Roman conquest in 9 AD, the territory of the present-day city was largely inhabited by Illyrians (mainly the Dardani) and Celts (the Scordisci). By the late 6th and early 7th centuries, large-scale Slavic raids and settlement began, along with invasions from Hunnic and Germanic tribes. Later, the area would become part of the First Bulgarian Empire. With the weakening of both the Bulgarian and Eastern Roman empires, Stefan Nemanja, Grand Prince of the consolidated medieval Serbian state, captured the territory between 1198 and 1199. Although it is hypothesized that the current area of the city was densely settled by the time of Stefan Nemanja&#x27;s conquest, it does not appear in medieval Serbian documents.

The first written mention of the city was in an Ottoman cadastral survey (&quot;defter&quot;) in 1476 after the city&#x27;s incorporation into the Sanjak of Smederevo. Referred to as &#x27;Kraguyfoça&#x27;, the settlement, after Ottoman conquest, consisted of a square formerly used as a market with 32 houses. The surrounding region was largely empty; even the forests that once dominated the region had been burned. By the end of the same century, however, the Ottoman administration began to slowly resettle the city&#x27;s area; by the 1536 cadastral survey, the town had 7 Muslim neighborhoods (&quot;mahalas&quot;) with 56 houses in total, along with a Christian community of 29 houses. On the left bank of the Lepenica, a mosque was erected.

===Habsburg-Ottoman conflict and major revolts===
In spite of its newfound consolidation under Turkish rule, the town&#x27;s location in strategic borderland between the Habsburg monarchy and the Ottoman Empire made it an area of frequent conflict in the modern era. During the Great Turkish War, the Austrians, under Louis of Baden, pushed the Turks far to the south of the city. Although this occupation was short-lived, it spelled an end to consolidated Ottoman rule in the region. Soon after, in 1718, Kragujevac became a part of the Habsburg Kingdom of Serbia following conquest by Prince Eugene of Savoy and the signing of Treaty of Passarowitz.

Under Austrian occupation, Kragujevac was fortified, the Muslim population was driven out and it became an uskok town. It was exclusively inhabited by Serbian Orthodox members of the national militia with their families. As one of the districts lying right on the Ottoman border, moreover, it was controlled by an uskok company (of the fourteen that guarded the frontier) and found itself under military jurisdiction. Accordingly, its chief was a Serbian military officer, First Captain Staniša Marković Mlatišuma, the second highest authority of the Serbian militia. In 1725 the first officially recorded cases of vampirism occurred in Kragujevac, in which two alleged vampires were accused of murdering 42 people. In other parts of Habsburg ruled Kingdom of Serbia similar cases followed after which the Serbian word vampir entered German and later other world languages. As the Ottomans retook the town in 1739, and lost it again in 1789 to the same enemy, the town was ripe for new rule—this time under Serbian rebels.
As a settlement central to the Sanjak of Smederevo under Ottoman rule, Kragujevac was of utmost strategic importance to its agitating, largely rural Serb inhabitants. Therefore, it became a centre of the Serbian Revolution, a national awakening of Serbs led by the grand &quot;vožd&quot;, Karađorđe. First liberated on 5 April 1804 during the First Serbian Uprising, the city was finally freed from imperial rule during the Second Serbian Uprising in 1815.

In 1818, Kragujevac, though largely depopulated following the conflicts of the preceding centuries, was proclaimed capital of the Principality of Serbia on 6 May 1818 by Miloš Obrenović in the medieval Vraćevšnica monastery. To mark the occasion, he built the Royal residence on the left bank of the Lepenica river. Amidža Konak is the only remaining building from the complex and the only landmark of 19th century Ottoman architecture in the city. The first institutions of the Principality of Serbia were founded in Kragujevac including the first courthouse, First gymnasium (grammar school) and the Princely Serbian theatre. The first Serbian constitution, the Sretenje Constitution, was proclaimed in the city on 15 September 1835. It was one of the most liberal European constitutions of its time, modeled on the French and Belgian constitutions.

=== Industrial development ===
Although the capital was moved from Kragujevac to Belgrade in 1841, the importance of Kragujevac only increased during the remainder of the 19th century as it grew into a city marked by its industry. Following centuries of economic underdevelopment, the underpinnings of the city&#x27;s modernization—and Serbia&#x27;s main munitions manufacturer, Zastava Arms—were laid in the commissioning of the city&#x27;s foundry complex in 1835. Known under its Serbian acronym VTZ, the complex was completed in 1850, and the first cannon was cast in 1853. Colloquially styled the &#x27;Knez&#x27;s arsenal&#x27;, its first director, Charles Loubry, was a French engineer authorized to take over this duty by the Emperor of France, Napoleon III.
Following the creation of the VTZ, industrial development continued at an unprecedented pace. The first telephone exchange was installed in 1858, and in 1868 the first industrial brewery was opened by Nikola Mesarović. The first printing press was founded in 1870. To connect the city&#x27;s burgeoning military industry as well as its production of iron ploughs to the rest of Serbia&#x27;s regions, the Belgrade–Niš railroad was built in 1886. To serve its industrial population, Serbia&#x27;s first grammar school (&quot;gimnazija)&quot;, the city&#x27;s first pharmacy, and its first cinema, located in a local &quot;kafana&quot;, were all built during the remainder of the 19th century, along with Kragujevac&#x27;s Great (or Upper) Park and, in 1891, its first regulatory urban plan. The city&#x27;s industrialism characterized it among its European peers, along with its workers&#x27; demonstrations, known as the &quot;Crveni barjak&quot; (&#x27;Red banner&#x27;) demonstrations, first held on 27 February 1876.
Today, the beginnings of the town&#x27;s industry, the now-defunct VTZ, have been recognized by the Serbian government as vital to Serbia&#x27;s cultural heritage and, as of 2017, consists of 151 individual objects, of which 31 are protected as unique heritage, including the old foundry, the machine workshop, the chimney, the fire lookout tower, the railroad bridge over the Lepenica River, and the cartridge factory. Once known by its non-industrial residents as the &#x27;Forbidden City&#x27; (&quot;Zabranjeni Grad),&quot; the complex is now open to the public.

=== World War I ===
During World War I, Kragujevac again became the capital of Serbia (1914–1915), and the seat of many state institutions—the Supreme Army Command was housed within the courthouse building.

A unit of the Scottish Women&#x27;s Hospital for Women&#x27;s Service was based there from December 1914 to November 1915. A list of those working in the hospital can be viewed on the website &quot;Imperial War Museum: Lives of the First World War &quot; and more information on these units is below.

During the war, Kragujevac lost around 15% of its population. On the night of 2 June 1918, a group of occupying Slovak soldiers from the Austro-Hungarian 71st infantry regiment mutinied in the city centre. The soldiers, led by Viktor Kolibík, had recently returned from captivity in Russia and were to be immediately deployed to the Italian Front. The mutiny failed, and 44 mutineers were executed.

===Yugoslavia===

Following World War I, Kragujevac became a part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, later renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In the period before the Second World War, the city continued its cultural and economic development with the founding of the Gundulić Theatre and the Kragujevac Academic Theatre as well as a number of new factories.
Following the Nazi invasion of Yugoslavia, the city came under direct Nazi occupation. After a joint Partisan-Chetnik attack on German forces in nearby Gornji Milanovac, &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Wilhelm Keitel calculated that 50 people were to be shot for every German soldier wounded and 100 people were to be shot for every German soldier killed. Franz Böhme therefore ordered the deaths of nearly 2,800 men and boys between 19 and 21 October 1941 in the Kragujevac massacre. The dead included a class from the city&#x27;s First Gymnasium; today, a monument to the executed pupils is the symbol of the city. The massacre inspired a poem titled &quot;Krvava Bajka&quot; (&quot;A Bloody Fairy Tale&quot;) by Desanka Maksimović.

The city was liberated from Nazi Germany on 21 October 1944.

In the post-war period, Kragujevac continued to develop its industry. Its main products were passenger cars, trucks and industrial vehicles, hunting arms, industrial chains, leather, and textiles. The biggest industry was Zastava Automobiles, which at one point employed tens of thousands people.

The first product of the Zastava Automobiles car company, the FIAT 750, was manufactured in 1955 under a licence to Fiat Automobiles (now Fiat Serbia). In the following three decades, more than five million passenger cars (FIAT 750, Zastava 1300, Zastava 101, Zastava 128, Zastava Yugo, Yugo Florida, Fiat 500L) were manufactured and marketed in 74 countries worldwide. Perhaps most famous among the automobiles produced is the Yugo, also marketed as the Zastava Korral.

The city&#x27;s industry greatly suffered under international economic sanctions during the Milošević era in the 1990s, and some parts were reduced to rubble in the 1999 NATO aggression against FR Yugoslavia.

===Kragujevac today===
The city today remains an industrial heart of Serbia, and has grown with the influx of students and refugees from the Yugoslav wars. In 2010, the city government signed a memorandum with the German development agency GIZ and in 2012 city hall adopted a strategy of urban development of the central city zone to be completed by 2030. As of December 2017, many objects within the complex deteriorated and the right bank of the Lepenica is urbanistically neglected. The authenticity and representative values of the complex must be preserved, but where it is allowed, the industrial and workers quarters will be transformed into the residential and commercial areas, traffic corridors and used for the numerous educational and cultural institutions Serbia&#x27;s industrial city continues to cherish.

The architecture of Kragujevac displays a fusion of many different styles. Historically, Ottoman (nowadays almost completely gone) and 19th century Vienna Secession style architecture have played an important role in the city&#x27;s landscape.

Newer architecture dominates the city&#x27;s panorama. A blend of Viennese, Balkan as well as Brutalism is present, as showcased in the monuments to the Kragujevac massacre. Post-war concrete apartment blocks built during the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia period are prominent. Today, glass office buildings reflect the ambitious business aspirations of the city. Some important buildings in Kragujevac include:

<text>Experimental archaeology (also called experiment archaeology) is a field of study which attempts to generate and test archaeological hypotheses, usually by replicating or approximating the feasibility of ancient cultures performing various tasks or feats. It employs a number of methods, techniques, analyses, and approaches, based upon archaeological source material such as ancient structures or artifacts.

It is distinct from uses of primitive technology without any concern for archaeological or historical study. Living history and historical reenactment, which are generally undertaken as hobbies, are non-archaeological counterparts of this academic discipline.

One of the main forms of experimental archaeology is the creation of copies of historical structures using only historically accurate technologies. This is sometimes known as reconstruction archaeology or reconstructional archaeology; however, reconstruction implies an exact replica of the past, when it is in fact just one person&#x27;s idea of the past; the more archaeologically correct term is a &quot;working construction of the past&quot;. In recent years, experimental archaeology has been featured in several television productions, such as BBC&#x27;s &quot;Building the Impossible&quot; and the PBS&#x27;s &quot;Secrets of Lost Empires&quot;. Most notable were the attempts to create several of Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s designs from his sketchbooks, such as his 15th century armed fighting vehicle.

== Examples ==

=== Butser Ancient Farm ===

One of the earliest examples is Butser Ancient Farm, which recreates buildings from UK archaeology to test theories of construction, use, and materials. Today, the site features a working Stone Age farm, a Bronze Age roundhouse, Iron Age village, Roman villa, and Saxon long halls. The work carried out at Butser has been instrumental in establishing experimental archaeology as a legitimate archaeological discipline, as well as assisted in bringing study of prehistory to the UK school curriculum.

Butser still carries out long-term experiments in prehistoric agriculture, animal husbandry, and manufacturing to test ideas posited by archaeologists, as well as introducing visitors to the discipline.

=== Lejre Land of Legends ===
Another early example is the Lejre Land of Legends, the oldest open-air museum in Denmark. The site features reconstructed buildings from the Stone Age, Iron Age, Viking era, and 19th century, and runs experiments on prehistoric living and technologies.

=== Other examples ===
* The &quot;Kon-Tiki&quot; expedition (1947), a balsa raft built by Thor Heyerdahl, sailed from Peru to Polynesia to demonstrate the possibility of cultural exchange between South America and the Polynesian islands.
* Attempts to transport large stones like those used in Stonehenge over short distances using only technology that would have been available at the time. The original stones were probably moved from Pembrokeshire to the site on Salisbury Plain.
* Since the 1970s the re-construction of timber framed buildings has informed understanding of early Anglo Saxon buildings at West Stow, Suffolk, England. This extensive program of research through experiment and experience continues today.
* The reconstruction of part of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall at Vindolanda, carried out in limited time by local volunteers.
* Greek triremes have been reconstructed by skilled sailors from plans and archaeological remains and have been successfully tried at sea.
* Attempts to manufacture steel that matches all the characteristics of Damascus steel, whose original manufacturing techniques have been lost for centuries, including computational fluid dynamics reconstructions by the University of Exeter of the Sri Lanka furnaces at Samanalawewa, thought to be the most likely sources for Damascus steel.
* Experiments using reproduction bâtons de commandement as spear throwers.
* Guédelon Castle, a medieval construction project located in Treigny, France.
* Ozark Medieval Fortress, a defunct sister project to Guédelon.
* The Pamunkey Project – Errett Callahan led a series of extended Late Woodland living experiences in Tidewater Virginia.
* The World Atlatl Association, an organization devoted to the use and research of atlatls, helped lobby for the legalization of atlatls as a means of deer hunting in Missouri.
* Marcus Junkelmann constructed Roman devices and gear for various museums. He also tested and analyzed them in various reenactments, among them a group of legionaries in full authentic gear crossing the Alps from Verona to Augsburg.
* Ma&#x27;agen Michael II, a replica of a 2,400-year-old merchantman; built by Haifa University and the Israel Antiquities Authority
* Reconstruction of Galileo&#x27;s Experiment: the inclined plane.
* Reconstruction of Lomonosov&#x27;s discovery of Venus&#x27;s atmosphere.
* Construction of a monastic community according to the ninth-century Plan of Saint Gall at Campus Galli.
* Janet Stephens utilizing her own skill as a hairdresser to reconstruct Roman-era hairstyles, rebutting previously held theories about single-prong pins being used to hold them in place.
* Ben Marwick trampled experimentally-produced flaked stone artefacts into sediments excavated from Malakunanja II to show that it was unlikely that they had moved extensively through the deposit during the Pleistocene.
* Killian Driscoll undertook a series of experiments to examine the prehistoric use of vein quartz. This involved experimental knapping to understand the fracture mechanics of the material; the experimental burning of quartz; and an experiment designed to investigate the ease of identification of stone tools made from quartz; this series was added to by an experiment that examined the effects of trampling on quartz tools compared to flint.
* Beginning in the 1980s, a project to build an Iron Age Roundhouse was led by a teacher at Cranborne Middle School. In 2002, the site was expanded into the Cranborne Ancient Technology Centre with an additional Viking Longhouse and Neolithic dwellings that are all used for educational purposes.
* At University College Dublin, Ireland, the Centre for Experimental Archaeology and Material Culture (founded 2012) is one of the only university campus facilities of this type for experimental archaeological research and teaching in the world. Their work has involved Mesolithic, early medieval and Viking Age houses, pottery, stone, flint, chert, and quartz technologies; bronze, iron and glass-working; and food production.
* Sutton Hoo Ships Company based in Woodbridge, Suffolk, UK is a 4-year project to build a full size reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo burial ship excavated by Basil Brown at Sutton Hoo in 1939. The reconstruction process is attempting to discover and use traditional boat building skills and methods that might have been used by the Anglo Saxon shipbuilders of the time.

== Variations ==

Other types of experimental archaeology may involve burying modern replica artifacts and ecofacts for varying lengths of time to analyse the post-depositional effects on them. Other archaeologists have built modern earthworks and measured the effects of silting in the ditches and weathering and subsidence on the banks to understand better how ancient monuments would have looked. One example is Overton Down in England.

The work of flintknappers is also a kind of experimental archaeology as much has been learnt about the many different types of flint tools through the hands-on approach of actually making them. Experimental archaeologists have equipped modern professional butchers, archers and lumberjacks with replica flint tools to judge how effective they would have been for certain tasks. Use wear traces on the modern flint tools are compared to similar traces on archaeological artifacts, making probability hypotheses on the possible kind of use feasible. Hand axes have been shown to be particularly effective at cutting animal meat from the bone and jointing it.

Another field of experimental archaeology is illustrated by the studies of the stone flaking abilities of humans (&quot;novice knapper&quot; studies) and of non-human primates. In the latter case it has been shown that, after human demonstrations, enculturated bonobos are able to produce modified cores and flaked stones which are morphologically similar to early lithic industries in East Africa.

Historians working on costume and fashion have made reconstructions of garments, including farthingales, which can give a better understanding of clothing types and textile crafts known only from archival records or depictions in portraits.

== In popular culture ==
The subject has proven popular enough to spawn several re-creation-type television shows:
* The 1978 BBC TV series &quot;Living in the Past&quot; re-created life in an Iron Age village with 15 volunteers over a period of 13 months.
* Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;I, Caveman&quot; and &quot;I, Caveman : The Great Hunt&quot;
* Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Time Team&quot;
* Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;The Colony&quot; seasons 1 and 2 showed aspects of experimental archaeology
* Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;MythBusters&quot; often conduct experimental archaeology to test the capability of mythical ancient weapons, including Archimedes&#x27; death ray and the tree cannon, as well as testing the capabilities of known weapons including the hwacha, wood vs. stone arrowheads, and the effects of cannonballs and splintering.
* The BBC has several re-creation farm series, including &quot;Tudor Monastery Farm&quot;, &quot;Tales from the Green Valley&quot;, &quot;Victorian Farm&quot;, &quot;Edwardian Farm&quot;, and &quot;Wartime Farm&quot;.
* BBC Two has a series on the construction of Guédelon Castle: &quot;Secrets of the Castle&quot;.
* UK based experimental archaeologist James Dilley of AncientCraft and the University of Southampton researches the production of tools and artefacts from the Palaeolithic to late Bronze Age. As well as demonstrating his findings frequently on TV programs, his work is on display in the British Museum and Stonehenge. His recent work is exploring hunting strategies of Upper Palaeolithic people in Europe and Bronze Age copper-alloy mould use.

<doc id="147114" wikidata="Q1248785" url="?curid=147114" title="The Bob Newhart Show">
<text>The Bob Newhart Show is an American sitcom television series produced by MTM Enterprises that aired on CBS from September 16, 1972, to April 1, 1978, with a total of 142 half-hour episodes over six seasons. Comedian Bob Newhart portrays a psychologist whose interactions with his wife, friends, patients, and colleagues lead to humorous situations and dialogue. The show was filmed before a live audience.

==Premise==
The show centers on Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Hartley (Newhart), a Chicago psychologist, his work and home life, with his supportive, though occasionally sarcastic, wife Emily (Suzanne Pleshette), and their friendly but mildly pesky neighbor, airline navigator Howard Borden (Bill Daily). The medical building where Bob&#x27;s practice is located also houses Jerry Robinson (Peter Bonerz), an orthodontist whose office is on the same floor, and their receptionist, Carol Kester (Marcia Wallace), as well as a number of other doctors who appear on the show occasionally.

Bob&#x27;s three most frequently seen regular patients are cynical, mean-spirited and neurotic Elliot Carlin (Jack Riley), milquetoast former US Marine cook Emil Peterson (John Fiedler), and quiet, reserved Lillian Bakerman (Florida Friebus), an older woman who spends most of her sessions knitting. Carlin was ranked 49th in &quot;TV Guide&quot;&#x27;s List of the 50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time, and Riley reprised the character in guest appearances on both &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; and &quot;Newhart&quot;.

Most of the situations involve Newhart&#x27;s character playing straight man to his wife, colleagues, friends, and patients. A frequent running gag on the show is an extension of Newhart&#x27;s stand-up comedy routines, where he played one side of a telephone conversation, the other side of which is not heard. In a nod to this, for the first two seasons, the episodes opened with Bob answering the telephone by saying &quot;Hello?&quot;

==Episodes==


The first four seasons of &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; aired on Saturday nights at 9:30p.m. Eastern Standard Time. During the winter of the 1976–77 season, the program moved to 8:30p.m. EST. For its final season during 1977–78, the program moved to 8:00p.m. EST.

The program typically aired following &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, which was also produced by MTM Enterprises.

The credits feature the Cooper Black typeface, after it was made famous in 1966 by its use in the artwork for the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; album.

===Finale===
In the show&#x27;s April Fools&#x27; Day final episode, &quot;Happy Trails to You,&quot; Bob gives up his practice and accepts a teaching position at a small college in Oregon. In the closing scene, Bob, Emily, Jerry, Carol and Howard exchange tearful goodbyes and embrace; an emotional Emily bursts into an impromptu refrain of &quot;Oklahoma,&quot; and the others join in (except for Howard, who does not know the words), a nod to &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; finale (also produced by MTM) from the previous year, in which the newsroom characters embraced and sang &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to Tipperary&quot;. The final credits show the cast of the episode in a curtain call.

==Awards and honors==
In 1977, the show received two Emmy nominations – for &quot;Outstanding Comedy Series&quot; and for Pleshette for &quot;Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actress in a Comedy Series&quot;. Newhart, himself, was nominated twice for a Golden Globe Award as &quot;Best TV Actor—Musical/Comedy&quot; in 1975 and 1976. In 1997, the episodes &quot;Over the River and Through the Woods&quot; and &quot;Death Be My Destiny&quot; were respectively ranked No. 9 and No. 50 on TV Guide&#x27;s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. TV Guide&#x27;s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time listed it as No. 44. In 2007, &quot;Time&quot; placed the show on its unranked list of &quot;100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME&quot;. Bravo ranked Bob Hartley 84th on its list of the 100 greatest TV characters.

In 2004, TV Land commemorated the show with a statue of Newhart in character as Dr. Hartley, seated and facing an empty couch, as if conducting a therapy session in his office. The statue was temporarily installed in front of 430 North Michigan Avenue, the building used for exterior establishing shots of Hartley&#x27;s office. The statue is now permanently located in the sculpture park adjacent to Chicago&#x27;s Navy Pier entertainment complex. In 2005, the TV Land Awards honored &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; with its Icon Award, presented by Ray Romano.

In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked the series No. 49 on its list of the 60 Best Series of All Time.

==Later appearances by series characters==

St. Elsewhere (1985)

Jack Riley reprised his Elliot Carlin role on a 1985 episode of &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; and partnered with Oliver Clark as the amnesiac John Doe Number Six. Carlin and Doe have been committed to the hospital&#x27;s mental ward, where Carlin treats Doe with the same verbal abuse he directed toward Clark&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Herd&quot; on &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;. Carlin blames his insanity on an unnamed &quot;quack in Chicago.&quot; While Oliver Clark&#x27;s recurring portrayal of John Doe Number Six is essentially identical to Mr. Herd, the two are never stated to be the same individual. In a nod to the &quot;Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, John Doe Number Six addresses a character played by Betty White as Sue Ann Nivens, which Betty White&#x27;s character denies.

ALF (1987)

In the 1987 &quot;ALF&quot; episode entitled &quot;Going Out of My Head Over You&quot;, Willie visits a psychologist, Dr. Lawrence &quot;Larry&quot; Dykstra, portrayed by Bill Daily. Jack Riley is in the waiting room, apparently portraying Elliot Carlin. Also in this episode, ALF mentions learning about psychology by watching episodes of &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;.

Newhart (1988 and 1990)

Riley appears in a 1988 episode of &quot;Newhart&quot;, playing an unnamed character who acts very much like Mr. Carlin. This character is being treated by the same therapist in Vermont whom Dick Loudon (Bob Newhart) visits for marriage counseling. Dick feels he recognizes Riley&#x27;s character, but cannot place his face; whereupon the unnamed patient insults him. Echoing Carlin&#x27;s statement from the 1985 &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, the therapist apologizes for her patient, explaining that it has taken her &quot;years to undo the damage caused by some quack in Chicago.&quot;

Tom Poston, who played Cliff &quot;The Peeper&quot; Murdock, Bob&#x27;s college friend from Vermont, played &quot;George&quot; the resident handyman from Vermont, throughout the Newhart series. Poston and Suzanne Pleshette married in 2001, with the marriage lasting until Poston&#x27;s death in 2007. Pleshette died the following year.

Newhart and Pleshette reprised their roles from the show for the 1990 finale of &quot;Newhart&quot;, in which it was revealed that the entire &quot;Newhart&quot; series had just been Bob Hartley&#x27;s dream. Bob and Emily awake in a room identical in appearance to their Chicago bedroom from &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;. (This plot device had previously been used in the season five finale (&quot;You&#x27;re Having My Hartley&quot;) in which Emily is pregnant. At the end, the pregnancy is revealed to have been a dream.)

The Bob Newhart Show: The 19th Anniversary Special (1991)

The entire cast assembled for the one-hour clip show &quot;The Bob Newhart Show: The 19th Anniversary Special&quot; in 1991, which finds the show&#x27;s characters in the present day. This show is set in Chicago, in the same apartment and office that Bob Hartley had in his 1970s show. During the course of the show, the characters analyzed Bob&#x27;s dream from the &quot;Newhart&quot; finale. At one point Howard recalled, &quot;I had a dream like that once. I dreamed I was an astronaut in Florida for five years,&quot; as scenes from &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; featuring Bill Daily as Roger Healey were shown.

Murphy Brown (1994)

Newhart played Bob Hartley on &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, in the episode &quot;Anything But Cured&quot; (March 14, 1994) to beg Carol (Marcia Wallace reprising her role from &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;) to leave her job as Murphy&#x27;s secretary and come back with him to Chicago.

Saturday Night Live (1995)

Newhart reprised Hartley twice in the February 11, 1995, episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In one sketch, he appears on a satirical version of &quot;Ricki Lake&quot;, befuddled by Ms. Lake&#x27;s dysfunctional guests and her armchair pop psychology. The episode ended with a repeat of &quot;Newhart&quot;’s &quot;just a dream&quot; scene, in which Bob Hartley again wakes up with Emily (Pleshette), and tells her that he just dreamed he had hosted &quot;SNL&quot;. Emily responds, &quot;That show&#x27;s not still on, is it?&quot;

George and Leo (1997)

&quot;George and Leo&quot; was a sitcom starring Bob Newhart and Judd Hirsch, and a 1997 episode called &quot;The Cameo Episode&quot; featured a raft of cameo appearances by their co-stars of previous series. Although the actors were not necessarily playing the same characters as they played in the previous shows, there was certainly a suggestion with some of the unnamed characters that they &quot;could&quot; be. Amongst the &quot;Bob Newhart Show&quot; actors making cameos in the episode were Peter Bonerz (as &quot;Dr. Robins&quot;), Oliver Clark, Bill Daily (as a pilot), John Fiedler, Tom Poston (as a police officer), Jack Riley, and Marcia Wallace.

CBS at 75 (2002)

Newhart and Pleshette, as &quot;The Hartleys,&quot; were the hosts of a segment of the &quot;CBS at 75&quot; broadcast.

==Home media==
20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the first four seasons of &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; on DVD in Region 1 in 2005/2006.

On February 3, 2014, Shout! Factory announced it had acquired the rights to the series. It subsequently released &quot;The Bob Newhart Show: The Complete Series&quot; on May 27, 2014. The fifth and sixth seasons were later released on DVD in individual sets on February 3, 2015.

==In popular culture==
Season 1 episode 7 of the 2019 Sci-fi alternate history series, &quot;For All Mankind&quot;, in which the USSR beats the United States to a crewed lunar landing, has the crew of Apollo 22 watching &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; on the Jamestown lunar base and greeting each other with &quot;Hi Bob.&quot;

<doc id="147116" wikidata="Q192914" url="?curid=147116" title="Cult of personality">
<text>A cult of personality, or a cult of the leader, is the result of an effort which is made to create an idealized and heroic image of a glorious leader, often through unquestioning flattery and praise. Historically, it has been developed through techniques such as the manipulation of the mass media, the dissemination of propaganda, the staging of spectacles, the manipulation of the arts, the instilling of patriotism, and government-organized demonstrations and rallies. A cult of personality is similar to apotheosis, except that it is established through the use of modern social engineering techniques, it is usually established by the state or the party in one-party states and dominant-party states. Cults of personality often accompany the leaders of totalitarian or authoritarian governments. They can also be seen in some monarchies, theocracies, failed democracies, and even in liberal democracies.

==Background==

Throughout human history, monarchs and other heads of state were frequently treated with enormous reverence and they were also thought to be endowed with super-human qualities. Through the principle of the divine right of kings, notably in medieval Europe, rulers were said to hold office by the will of God or the will of the gods. Ancient Egypt, Imperial Japan, the Inca, the Aztecs, Tibet, Siam (now Thailand), and the Roman Empire are especially noted for their redefinition of monarchs as &quot;god-kings&quot;. Furthermore, the Imperial cult of ancient Rome identified emperors and some members of their families with the divinely sanctioned authority (auctoritas) of the Roman State.

The spread of democratic and secular ideas in Europe and North America in the 18th and 19th centuries made it increasingly difficult for monarchs to preserve this aura, though Napoleon III, and Queen Victoria appreciated its perpetuation in their &quot;carte-de-visite&quot; portraits which proliferated, circulated and were collected in the 19th century.

The subsequent development of mass media, such as radio, enabled political leaders to project a positive image of themselves onto the masses as never before. It was from these circumstances in the 20th century that the most notorious personality cults arose. Frequently, these cults are a form of political religion.

The advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web in the 21st century has renewed the personality cult phenomenon. Disinformation via social media platforms and the twenty-four hour news cycle has enabled the widespread dissemination and acceptance of deceptive information and propaganda. As a result, personality cults have grown and remained popular in many places, corresponding with a marked rise in authoritarian government across the world.

The term &quot;cult of personality&quot; likely appeared in English around 1800–1850, along with the French and German versions of the term. It initially had no political connotations, but was instead closely related to the Romanticist &quot;cult of genius&quot;. The first known political use of the phrase appeared in a letter from Karl Marx to German political worker Wilhelm Blos dated to November 10, 1877:

==Characteristics==

There are various views about what constitutes a cult of personality in a leader. Historian Jan Plamper wrote that modern-day personality cults display five characteristics that set them apart from &quot;their predecessors&quot;: The cults are secular and &quot;anchored in popular sovereignty&quot;; their objects are all males; they target the entire population, not only the well-to-do or just the ruling class; they use mass media; they exist where the mass media can be controlled enough to inhibit the introduction of &quot;rival cults&quot;.

In his 2013 paper, &quot;What is character and why it really does matter&quot;, Thomas A. Wright stated, &quot;The cult of personality phenomenon refers to the idealized, even god-like, public image of an individual consciously shaped and molded through constant propaganda and media exposure. As a result, one is able to manipulate others based entirely on the influence of public personality ... the cult of personality perspective focuses on the often shallow, external images that many public figures cultivate to create an idealized and heroic image.&quot;

Adrian Teodor Popan defined a cult of personality as a &quot;quantitatively exaggerated and qualitatively extravagant public demonstration of praise of the leader.&quot; He also identified three causal &quot;necessary, but not sufficient, structural conditions, and a path-dependent chain of events which, together, lead to the cult formation: a particular combination of patrimonialism and clientelism, lack of dissidence, and systematic falsification pervading the society&#x27;s culture.&quot;

One underlying characteristic, as explained by John Pittman, is the nature of the cult of personalities to be a patriarch. The idea of the cult of personalities that coincides with the Marxist movements gains popular footing among the men in power with the idea that they would be the &quot;fathers of the people&quot;. By the end of the 1920s, the male features of the cults became more extreme. Pittman identifies that these features became roles including the &quot;formal role for a [male] &#x27;great leader&#x27; as a cultural focus of the apparatus of the regime: reliance on top-down &#x27;administrative measures&#x27;: and a pyramidal structure of authority&quot; which was created by a single ideal.

==Role of mass media==
The twentieth century brought technological advancements that made it possible for regimes to package propaganda in the form of radio broadcasts, films, and later content on the internet.

Writing in 2013, Thomas A. Wright observed that &quot;[i]t is becoming evident that the charismatic leader, especially in politics, has increasingly become the product of media and self-exposure.&quot; Focusing on the media in the United States, Robert N. Bellah added, &quot;It is hard to determine the extent to which the media reflect the cult of personality in American politics and to what extent they have created it. Surely they did not create it all alone, but just as surely they have contributed to it. In any case, American politics is dominated by the personalities of political leaders to an extent rare in the modern world ... in the personalized politics of recent years the &#x27;charisma&#x27; of the leader may be almost entirely a product of media exposure.&quot;

==Purpose==

Jan Plamper argues while Napoleon III made some innovations in France, it was Benito Mussolini in Italy in the 1920s who originated the model of dictator-as-cult-figure that was emulated by Hitler, Stalin and the others, using the propaganda powers of a totalitarian state.

Pierre du Bois de Dunilac argues that the Stalin cult was elaborately constructed to legitimize his rule. Many deliberate distortions and falsehoods were used. The Kremlin refused access to archival records that might reveal the truth, and key documents were destroyed. Photographs were altered and documents were invented. People who knew Stalin were forced to provide &quot;official&quot; accounts to meet the ideological demands of the cult, especially as Stalin himself presented it in 1938 in &quot;Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)&quot;, which became the official history.

Historian David L. Hoffmann states &quot;The Stalin cult was a central element of Stalinism, and as such it was one of the most salient features of Soviet rule ... Many scholars of Stalinism cite the cult as integral to Stalin&#x27;s power or as evidence of Stalin&#x27;s megalomania.&quot;

In Latin America, Cas Mudde and Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser link the &quot;cult of the leader&quot; to the concept of the &quot;caudillo&quot;, a strong leader &quot;who exercises a power that is independent of any office and free of any constraint.&quot; These populist strongmen are portrayed as &quot;masculine and potentially violent&quot; and enhance their authority through the use of the cult of personality. Mudde and Kaltwasser trace the linkage back to Juan Perón of Argentina.

==States and systems with personality cults==
===Argentina===

Juan Perón, who was elected three times as President of Argentina, and his second wife, Eva &quot;Evita&quot; Perón, were immensely popular among many of the Argentine people, and to this day they are still considered icons by the leading Justicialist Party. In contrast, academics and detractors often considered him a demagogue and a dictator. Perón sympathised with the Axis powers when he was a colonel and Minister of War and even served as a diplomatic envoy to Fascist Italy. During his regime he kept close ties with Francoist Spain. He ferociously persecuted dissents and potential political rivals, as political arrests were common during his first two terms. He eroded the republican principles of the country as a way to stay in power and forced statewide censorship on most media. Following his election, he built a personality cult around both himself and his wife so pervasive it is still a part of Argentina&#x27;s current political life.

During Perón&#x27;s regime, schools were forced to read Evita&#x27;s biography &quot;La Razón de mi Vida&quot;, union and government jobs were only given to those who could prove themselves to be a fervent Peronist, newspapers were censored and television and radio networks were nationalized, and only state media was allowed. He often showed contempt for any opponents, regularly characterizing them as traitors and agents of foreign powers. Those who did not fall in line or were perceived as a threat to Perón&#x27;s political power were subject to losing their jobs, threats, violence and harassment. Perón dismissed over 20,000 university professors and faculty members from all major public education institutions. Universities were then intervened, the faculty was pressured to get in line and those who resisted were blacklisted, dismissed or exiled. Numerous prominent cultural and intellectual figures were imprisoned. Thousands of artists, scientists, writers and academics left the country, migrated to North America or Europe. Union leaders and political rivals were arrested and tortured for years and were only released after Perón was deposed.

===Azerbaijan===
===Brazil===
===Bangladesh===
Mujibism initially began as the political ideology of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, which was gradually converted into a cult of personality around him by his daughter Sheikh Hasina, leader of the Awami League, the party which under the leadership of Mujib, led Bangladesh&#x27;s secession from Pakistan. After being pushed to the sidelines by 2 successive military dictators Ziaur Rehman (who founded the Bangladesh Nationalist Party) &amp; Hussain Muhammad Ershad (who founded the Bangladesh National Party), Mujib came back to dominate public consciousness from 2008 under the Awami League government led by Hasina. Hasina has been criticised for overemphasising the role of her father &amp; the Awami League in securing Bangladeshi independence at the cost of sidelining other prominent figures &amp; political parties of the time. Hasina had amended the constitution to make the presence of Mujib&#x27;s portrait mandatory in every school, government office &amp; diplomatic missions of the country &amp; made it illegal to criticise Mujib, his ideals &amp; his deeds, especially the one-party BAKSAL regime (1972–75) headed by him, through writing, speech or electronic media. Many events commemorating the birth-centenary of &quot;Bangabandhu&quot; (&#x27;Friend of Bengal&#x27; in Bengali, the honorific unofficial title given to Mujib in his lifetime) were launched by the Hasina administration, including an official in collaboration with the Indian government. The Hasina government converted Mujib&#x27;s residence in the capital city of Dhaka, where he &amp; his family was assassinated by mutinous military personnel in 1975, into a memorial museum. Hasina designated the day of Mujib&#x27;s assassination as the National Day of Mourning. The Hasina government also made the birthdays of Mujib, his wife Sheikh Fazilatunessa, eldest son Sheikh Kamal &amp; youngest son Sheikh Russel as official government holidays, alongside March 7 (on that day in 1971, Mujib declared Bangladesh&#x27;s secession at a speech in Dhaka). Under Hasina&#x27;s rule, the country was dotted with numerous statues of Mujib alongside several roads &amp; prominent institutions named after him. Critics state that Hasina utilises the personality cult around her father to justify her own authoritarianism, crackdown on political dissent &amp; democratic backsliding of the country. Following the violent overthrow of Sheikh Hasina in 2024, the cult of personality around Mujib is being systematically dismantled.

===China===
Mao Zedong&#x27;s cult of personality was a prominent part of Chairman Mao Zedong&#x27;s rule over the People&#x27;s Republic of China from his rise in 1949 until his death in 1976. Mass media, propaganda and a series of other techniques were used by the state to elevate Mao Zedong&#x27;s status to that of an infallible heroic leader, who could stand up against The West, and guide China to become a beacon of Communism. Mao himself, however, publicly criticized the personality cult which was formed around him.

During the period of the Cultural Revolution, Mao&#x27;s personality cult soared to an unprecedented height. Mao&#x27;s face was firmly established on the front page of &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;, where a column of his quotes was also printed every day. Mao&#x27;s Selected Works were later printed in even greater circulation; the number of his portraits (1.2 billion) was more than the inhabitants in China. And soon Chairman Mao badges began to appear; in total, about 4.8 billion were manufactured. Every Chinese citizen was presented with the &quot;Little Red Book&quot; – a selection of quotes from Mao. It was prescribed to be carried everywhere and displayed at all public events, and citizens were expected to quote the contents of the book daily. Mao himself believed that the situation had gone out of hand, and in a conversation with Edgar Snow in 1970, he denounced the titles of &quot;Great Leader, Great Supreme Commander, Great Helmsman&quot; and insisted on only being called &quot;teacher&quot;. Admiration for Mao Zedong has remained widespread in China in spite of somewhat general knowledge of his actions. In December 2013, a &quot;Global Times&quot; poll revealed that over 85% of Chinese viewed Mao&#x27;s achievements as outweighing his mistakes.

Chiang Kai-shek had a cult of personality. His portraits were commonly displayed in private homes and they were also commonly displayed in public on the streets. When the Muslim general and warlord Ma Lin was interviewed, he was described as having &quot;high admiration for and unwavering loyalty to Chiang Kai-shek&quot;.

After the Cultural Revolution, Deng Xiaoping and others launched the &quot;Boluan Fanzheng&quot; program which invalidated the Cultural Revolution and abandoned (and forbade) the use of a personality cult.

A cult of personality has been developing around Xi Jinping since he became General Secretary of the ruling Chinese Communist Party and the regime&#x27;s paramount leader in 2012.

=== Dominican Republic ===
Longtime dictator of the Dominican Republic Rafael Trujillo (ruled 1930–1961) was the center of a large personality cult. The nation&#x27;s capital city, its highest peak, and a province were renamed for him. Statues of &quot;El Jefe&quot; were mass-produced and erected across the country, and bridges and public buildings were named in his honor. Automobile license plates included slogans such as &quot;¡Viva Trujillo!&quot; and &quot;Año Del Benefactor De La Patria&quot; (Year of the Benefactor of the Nation). An electric sign was erected in Ciudad Trujillo so that &quot;Dios y Trujillo&quot; could be seen at night as well as in the day. Eventually, even churches were required to post the slogan &quot;Dios en el cielo, Trujillo en la tierra&quot; (God in Heaven, Trujillo on Earth). As time went on, the order of the phrases was reversed (Trujillo on Earth, God in Heaven).

===Haiti===

François Duvalier, also known as Papa Doc, was a Haitian politician who served as the president of Haiti from 1957 until his death in 1971. He was elected president in the 1957 general election on a populist and black nationalist platform. After thwarting a military coup d&#x27;état in 1958, his regime rapidly became more autocratic and despotic. An undercover government death squad, the Tonton Macoute (), indiscriminately tortured or killed Duvalier&#x27;s opponents; the Tonton Macoute was thought to be so pervasive that Haitians became highly fearful of expressing any form of dissent, even in private. Duvalier further sought to solidify his rule by incorporating elements of Haitian mythology into a personality cult.

===Italy===

Benito Mussolini was portrayed as the embodiment of Italian Fascism and as a result, he was keen to be seen as such. Mussolini was styled by other Italian fascists as Il Duce (&quot;The Leader&quot;). Since Mussolini was represented as an almost omniscient leader, a common saying in Italy during Mussolini&#x27;s rule was &quot;The Duce is always right&quot; (Italian: &quot;Il Duce ha sempre ragione&quot;). Mussolini became a unifying force in Italy in order for ordinary Italians to put their difference to one side with local officials. The personality cult surrounding Mussolini became a way for him to justify his personal rule and it acted as a way to enable social and political integration.

Mussolini&#x27;s military service in World War I and survival of failed assassination attempts were used to convey a mysterious aura around him. Fascist propaganda stated that Mussolini&#x27;s body had been pierced by shrapnel just like St. Sebastian had been pierced by arrows, the difference being that Mussolini had survived this ordeal. Mussolini was also compared to St. Francis of Assisi, who had, like Mussolini, &quot;suffered and sacrificed himself for others&quot;.

The press were given instructions on what and what not to write about Mussolini. Mussolini himself authorized which photographs of him were allowed to be published and rejected any photographs which made him appear weak or less prominent than he wanted to be portrayed as in a particular group.

Italy&#x27;s war against Ethiopia (1935–37) was portrayed in propaganda as a revival of the Roman Empire, with Mussolini as the first Roman emperor Augustus. To improve his own image, as well as the image of Fascism in the Arab world, Mussolini declared himself to be the &quot;Protector of Islam&quot; during an official visit to Libya in 1937.

===India===


During the days of the freedom struggle, Mahatma Gandhi had a cult-like following amongst the people of India. Congress leaders like Chittaranjan Das &amp; Subhash Chandra Bose who opposed Gandhi&#x27;s methods, found themselves sidelined within the party. The assassination of Gandhi in 1948 led to widespread violence against Marathi Brahmins by his followers. After Gandhi&#x27;s death, his cult was eclipsed by another personality cult that had developed around India&#x27;s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. C Rajagopalachari criticized the personality cult surrounding Nehru, saying that there should be an opposition group within the Congress. Rajagopalachari later formed the economically right-wing Swatantra Party in opposition to Nehru&#x27;s socialist economic view. The expression &#x27;Nehruvian consensus&#x27; reflects the dominance of Nehruvian ideals, a product of Nehru&#x27;s personality cult and the associated statism, i.e. the overarching faith in the state and the leadership. However, Nehru himself actively discouraged the creation of a cult of personality around him. He wrote an essay titled &#x27;Rashtrapati&#x27; in 1937 published in the &quot;Modern Review&quot; warning people about dictatorship and emphasizing the value of questioning leaders.

The Congress party has been accused of promoting a personality cult centered around Nehru, his daughter Indira Gandhi &amp; the Nehru-Gandhi family. Indira Gandhi has also been described as having a cult of personality during her administration. Following India&#x27;s victory in the 1971 Indo-Pak war, Gandhi was hailed by many as a manifestation of the Hindu goddess Durga. In that year, Gandhi nominated herself as a recipient for the Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award of the country. During the Emergency period the then Congress party president Devakanta Barooah, had remarked &quot;&#x27;India is Indira, Indira is India&quot;&#x27;. Her assassination in 1984 by her Sikh bodyguards sparked a massive wave of public grief &amp; anti-Sikh violence. The Congress party led by her son Rajiv Gandhi utilised her death to win the general elections shortly held after. His assassination while campaigning in the 1991 general elections also led to widespread public grief, which was utilised by the Congress to win the elections despite unfavorable circumstances.

Current Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is often criticized for creating a personality cult around him. Despite some setbacks and criticism, Modi&#x27;s charisma and popularity was a key factor that helped the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) return to power in the 2019 general elections. Shivraj Singh Chouhan, the chief minister of the country&#x27;s second largest state, said in 2022, &quot;He is superhuman and has traces of God in him.&quot; The Opposition often accused Modi for spreading propaganda using popular media such as movies, television and web series. Modi is often accused of having narcissist traits. In 2015, Modi wore a suit which has his name embroidered all over it in fine letters while greeting US president Barack Obama during his bilateral visit to India. This suit was auctioned that year, selling at a record amount of 43.1 million Indian rupees, thereby earning the Guinness World Records for the most expensive suit. In 2019, a biographical film of Modi was released, which was heavily criticized for its hagiographical nature. In 2021, Modi named the world&#x27;s largest cricket stadium after himself. During the 2024 general elections, Modi tried to divinise himself in an interview, in which he stated that he viewed himself to be sent directly by God to serve a special purpose on Earth. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra while campaigning in the Hindu holy city of Puri stated that even Jagannath (the form of the Hindu god Vishnu which is venerated there) worships Modi. The BJP is also stated to have created a cult of personality around Hindu Mahasabha leader V. D. Savarkar &amp; Gandhi&#x27;s assassin Nathuram Godse to oppose the dominance of Gandhian philosophy in Indian society.

One study claims that India&#x27;s political culture since the decline of the Congress&#x27; single-handed dominance over national politics from the 1990s onwards as a fallout of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement &amp; Mandal Commission protests has paved way for personality cults centered around leaders of the small regional parties, derived from hero-worship of sportspersons &amp; film industry celebrities and the concept of &quot;bhakti&quot;, which in turn has fostered nepotism, cronyism &amp; sycophancy. Among these leaders, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalitha had one of the most extensive ones. She was widely referred by leaders &amp; members of her party as &quot;Amma&quot; (&#x27;mother&#x27; in Tamil, also used to refer to Hindu goddesses) &amp; would prostrate themselves before her. She would be regularly publicly applauded with Tamil titles like &quot;Makkalin Mudhalvar&quot; (people&#x27;s chief minister), &quot;Puratchi Thalaivi&quot; (revolutionary female leader), &quot;Thanga Thalaivi&quot; (golden female leader) etc by her cadres. Her government provided various kinds of subsidised goods under the brand name of &quot;Amma&quot;. Widespread violence broke out throughout the state when she was arrested on charges of corruption. A huge wave of public grief swept all over the state, with some even committing suicide, following her death in 2016. Another leader, Mayawati, was also known for attempting to foster a cult of personality during her tenure as the Chief Minister of India&#x27;s most populous state by getting constructed large statues of herself &amp; the elephant (which was the electoral symbol of her party) that were installed in public parks at the cost of government exchequer.


Historical personalities are also deified to the level of cult worship long after their lifetimes which is utilised by politicians to woo their followers for electoral purposes. Prominent examples are the cult of Shivaji in Maharashtra &amp; the cult of Dr. B. R. Ambedkar among Dalits.

===Germany===

Starting in the 1920s, during the early years of the Nazi Party, Nazi propaganda began to depict the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler as a demagogue figure who was the almighty defender and savior of Germany. After the end of World War I and the Treaty of Versailles, the German people were left in turmoil under the Weimar Republic, and, according to Nazi propaganda, only Hitler could save them and restore Germany&#x27;s greatness, which in turn gave rise to the &quot;Führer-cult&quot;. During the five election campaigns in 1932, the Nazi newspaper &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; portrayed Hitler as a man who had a mass movement united behind him, a man with one mission to solely save Germany as the &#x27;Leader of the coming Germany&#x27;. The Night of the Long Knives in 1934 – after which Hitler referred to himself as being single-handedly &quot;responsible for the fate of the German people&quot; – also helped to reinforce the myth that Hitler was the sole protector of the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;, the ethnic community of the German people.

Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels cultivated an image of Hitler as a &quot;heroic genius&quot;. The myth also gave rise to the saying and concept, &quot;If only the Führer knew&quot;. Germans thought that problems which they ascribed to the Nazi hierarchy would not have occurred if Hitler had been aware of the situation; thus Nazi bigwigs were blamed, and Hitler escaped criticism.

British historian Ian Kershaw published his book &quot;The &quot;Hitler Myth&quot;: Image and Reality in the Third Reich&quot; in 1987 and wrote:
During the early 1930s, the myth was given credence due to Hitler&#x27;s perceived ability to revive the German economy during the Great Depression. However, Albert Speer wrote that by 1939, the myth was under threat and the Nazis had to organize cheering crowds to turn up to events. Speer wrote:
The myth helped to unite the German people during World War II, especially against the Soviet Union and the Western Allies. During Hitler&#x27;s early victories against Poland and Western Europe the myth was at its peak, but when it became obvious to most Germans that the war was lost then the myth was exposed and Hitler&#x27;s popularity declined.

A report is given in the little Bavarian town of Markt Schellenberg on March 11, 1945:

===North Korea===
The cult of personality which surrounds North Korea&#x27;s ruling family, the Kim family, has existed for decades and it can be found in many aspects of North Korean culture. Although not acknowledged by the North Korean government, many defectors and Western visitors state there are often stiff penalties for those who criticize or do not show &quot;proper&quot; respect for the regime. The personality cult began soon after Kim Il Sung took power in 1948, and was greatly expanded after his death in 1994.

The pervasiveness and the extreme nature of North Korea&#x27;s personality cult surpasses those of Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong. The cult is also marked by the intensity of the people&#x27;s feelings for and devotion to their leaders, and the key role played by a Confucianized ideology of familism both in maintaining the cult and thereby in sustaining the regime itself. The North Korean cult of personality is a large part of Juche and totalitarianism.

Yakov Novichenko, a Soviet military officer who saved Kim Il Sung&#x27;s life on 1 May 1946, is reported to also have developed a cult of personality around 1984. He is considered the only non-Korean to have developed a cult of personality there. 

===Peru===
===Philippines===


Nowadays both conservative and liberal groups have developed cult of personalities around their political frontman, most notably supporters of Leni Robredo who are dubbed as &quot; &#x27;kakampinks&#x27; &quot; or less commonly &quot; &#x27;pinklawan&#x27; &quot;, both a play on her affiliation with the Liberal Party and her branding of pink/magenta colors, Bongbong Marcos and his family, mostly surrounding his father&#x27;s legacy, and Rodrigo Duterte and his family dubbed &quot; &#x27;Diehard Duterte Supporters&#x27; &quot;, a play on the acronym of Rodrigo Duterte&#x27;s Davao Death Squad.

===Poland===
===Romania===
===Russia===
Russian President Vladimir Putin has created a cult of personality for himself as an outdoorsy, sporty, tough guy public image, demonstrating his physical capabilities and taking part in unusual or dangerous acts, such as extreme sports and interaction with wild animals.

===Soviet Union===

The first cult of personality to take shape in the USSR was Vladimir Lenin. Up until the dissolution of the USSR, Lenin&#x27;s portrait and quotes were a ubiquitous part of the culture. However, during his lifetime, Lenin vehemently denounced any effort to build a cult of personality as in his eyes the cult of personality was antithetical to Marxism. Despite this, members of the Communist Party further used Lenin&#x27;s image as the all-knowing revolutionary who would liberate the proletariat. Lenin attempted to take action against this; however it was halted as Lenin was nearly assassinated in August 1918. His health would only further decline as he suffered numerous severe strokes with the worst in May 1922 and March 1923. In this state Lenin would lose the ability to walk and speak. It was during this time that the Communist Party began to promote the accomplishments of Lenin as the basis for his cult of personality, using him as an image of morality and revolutionary ideas.

After Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s death in 1924 and the exile of Leon Trotsky, Joseph Stalin came to embody the Soviet Union. Once Lenin&#x27;s cult of personality had risen in power, creating enough influence, Stalin integrated his ideals into his own cult. Unlike other cults of personalities, the Lenin and Stalin cults were not created to give the leaders power, they were created to give power and validation to the Communist Party. Stalin initially spoke out against the cult and other outrageous and false claims centered around him. However Stalin&#x27;s attitude began to shift in favor of the cult in the 1930s and he began to encourage it following the Great Purge. Seldom did Stalin object to state actions that furthered his cult of personality, however he did oppose some initiatives from Soviet propagandists. When Nikolai Yezhov proposed to rename Moscow to &quot;Stalinodar&quot;, which translates to &quot;gift of Stalin&quot;, Stalin objected. To merge the idea of the Lenin and Stalin cults together, Stalin changed aspects of Lenin&#x27;s life in the public&#x27;s eye in order to place himself in power. This kept the two cults in a line that showed that both Lenin and Stalin had the same ideas and that Stalin was the rightful successor of Lenin, leading the USSR in the fashion Lenin would have.

In December 1929, Stalin celebrated his 50th birthday which made Stalin become a prominent feature in the Soviet press. The Soviet press used positive adjectives like, &quot;Great&quot;, &quot;Beloved&quot;, &quot;Bold&quot;, &quot;Wise&quot;, &quot;Inspirer&quot;, and &quot;Genius&quot; to describe him. Similarly, speeches that were given by people to the peasants described Stalin as &quot;Our Best Collective Farm Worker&quot;, &quot;Our Shockworker, Our Best of Best&quot;, and &quot;Our Darling, Our Guiding Star&quot;. By 1934, under Stalin&#x27;s full control of the country, socialist realism became the endorsed method of art and literature. Even under the communist regime, the Stalin cult of personality portrayed Stalin&#x27;s leadership as patriarchy under the features laid out during Khrushchev&#x27;s speech. After 1936, the Soviet press described Stalin as the &quot;Father of Nations&quot;.

One key element of Soviet propaganda was interactions between Stalin and the children of the Soviet Union. He was often photographed with children of different ethnic backgrounds of the Soviet Union and was often photographed giving gifts to children. In 1935 the phrase, &quot;Thank You, Dear Comrade Stalin, for a Happy Childhood!&quot; started to appear above doorways at nurseries, orphanages, and schools; children also chanted this slogan at festivals. Another key element of Soviet propaganda was imagery of Stalin and Lenin. In many posters, Stalin and Lenin were placed together to show their camaraderie and that their ideals were one. Throughout the 1930s, posters with both images were used as a way to bring the nation and the military together under the policies of the Communist Party during World War II, with the idea of Lenin as the father of the revolutionary ideas and Stalin as the disciple who would fulfill the communist ideals. Stalin was also portrayed in numerous films produced by Mosfilm, which remained a Soviet-led company until the fall of the Soviet Union.

=== Spain ===
Following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Francisco Franco&#x27;s image was deliberately crafted through extensive nationalist propaganda that portrayed him as a messianic figure and savior of traditional Spanish values against republican and communist forces. The carefully constructed narrative emphasized his military prowess and Catholic piety, with state-controlled media consistently depicting him as &quot;El Caudillo&quot; (The Leader), a divinely appointed guardian of Spain&#x27;s cultural and religious heritage.

=== Syria ===

Syria&#x27;s Hafez al-Assad, a Ba&#x27;athist officer who seized power through a coup d&#x27;état in 1970, established a pervasive cult of personality to maintain his dictatorship. As soon as he took over power, Ba&#x27;ath party loyalists designated him as &quot;Al-Abad&quot;; an Arabic terminology with deep religious dimensions. Linguistically, &quot;&quot;Al-Abad&quot;&quot; means &quot;forever, infinite and immortality&quot; and religious clerics use this term in relation to Divine Attributes. By designating Assad as &quot;Al-Abad&quot;, Syrian Ba&#x27;ath Movement ideologically elevated Hafez al-Assad as its &quot;Immortal&quot;, &quot;god-like figure&quot; who is supposed to represent the state as well as the Syrian nation itself. Another meaning of &quot;Al-Abad&quot; is &quot;permanent&quot;, which is used in state propaganda to denote the perpetual &quot;status quo&quot; of an &quot;eternal political order&quot; created by Hafez al-Assad, who continues to live in Assadist ideology. The term&#x27;s verbal form &quot;Abada&quot; means &quot;to commit genocide&quot; including the &quot;symbolical; performative side of violence&quot;. This dimension has been weaponized by the Assad regime to monopolize violence against alleged dissidents and justify state terrorism, including genocidal acts of mass murder like the Hama Massacre, Qamishli Massacre and other massacres of the Syrian civil war.

Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath party initially manufactured Hafez al-Assad&#x27;s cult of Arab socialist heroism in consultancy with Soviet state propagandists, mimicking the pervasive personality cults prevalent across Soviet Bloc dictatorships like Romania and North Korea. Beginning as a tool to bind every Syrian citizen with the obligation of undying loyalty (&quot;bay&#x27;ah&quot;) to Assad in 1970s, the propaganda was further intensified and personalist depictions reached new heights during the 1980s. The state began re-writing Syrian history itself, with the Ba&#x27;ath party deifying Hafez al-Assad as their &quot;leader for eternity&quot; [&quot;qa&#x27;iduna ila l-abad&quot;] and portraying him as &quot;the second Saladin&quot; who guarantees Arab peoples victory over Zionist Crusaders. Through kindergarten, school books, educational institutions and Baathist media; Assadist propaganda constructed the image of a homogenous Arab nation protected by a fatherly leader revelling under the &quot;cult of Saladin&quot;. Assad regime venerates Hafez al-Assad&#x27;s personalist iconography perpetually in the public and private spheres of everyday Syrian life; through monuments, images, murals, posters, statues, stamps, Ba&#x27;athist symbolism, currency notes, photos, banners, state TV, etc.
More than a leader of the masses, Ba&#x27;athist propaganda equated Hafez al-Assad itself with &quot;the people&quot;, apart from declaring him as the &quot;father of the nation&quot; and as an exceptional human being; being assigned with multiple roles as a doctor, soldier, lawyer, educator, statesman, general, etc. Every civil society organization, trade union and any form of cultural or religious associations in Syria, are obliged to declare their &quot;binding covenant to Hafez al-Assad and display his iconography, in order to be legalized. The far-reaching personality cult of his father has been weaponized by Bashar al-Assad as a pillar of his regime&#x27;s legitimacy and also as a supplement to enhance his own personality cult. Bashar&#x27;s cult downplayed religious elements for technocratic Arab socialist themes, with a constant militaristic emphasis on conspiratorial threats from forces of Zionism due to an allegedly ongoing &quot;dormant war with Israel&quot;.

One utilization of the personality cult has been to enable the Assad dynasty to downplay the rural Alawite origins of their family from public eyes. Images of Assad family members are installed across Syria&#x27;s numerous heritage sites and monuments, to wed the dynasty with Ba&#x27;athist Syrian history. Murals and statues of Hafez al-Assad and Bashar al-Assad were constructed across Syrian cities, towns, villages, etc. depicting them in the costumes of medieval Bedouins or as sultans like Harun al-Rashid. Assadist cult of personality functioned as a psychological tool for the totalitarian regime; which attempted to claim towards the Syrian society that the Ba&#x27;athist system shall continue ruling eternally, forever, with no end. The Assadist cult is being dismantled following the fall of the Assad regime.

===Turkey===
===Turkmenistan===
Saparmurat Niyazov, who was President of Turkmenistan from 1985 to 2006, is another oft-cited cultivator of a cult of personality. Human Rights Watch, in its &quot;World Report 2012&quot;, said there was a cult of personality of President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow. Agence France-Presse reported a developing personality cult. Reporters Without Borders said the president was promoting a cult of personality around himself and that his portraits had taken the place of those of the previous president.

===United States===

A number of presidents in American history have been noted by various historians as being supported by the effects of a cult of personality, among them George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump. Conrad Black, who wrote several biographies of American presidents, argued that &quot;supreme champion of the American personality cult&quot; has &quot;deservedly&quot; been Abraham Lincoln. John F. Kennedy&#x27;s cult of personality largely came about after his assassination, although his and his wife Jackie Kennedy&#x27;s appearance all contributed to the aura of &quot;Camelot&quot; which surrounded his administration.

Another American politician to whom a cult of personality has been ascribed is Huey Long, the populist governor of Louisiana from 1928 to 1932, who continued to control the politics of the state as a United States senator until he was assassinated in 1935. The LaRouche movement has been considered to be a personality cult based upon Lyndon LaRouche.

===Venezuela===
===Vietnam===

The Vietnamese Communist Party regime has continually maintained a personality cult around Ho Chi Minh since the 1950s in North Vietnam, and it was later extended to South Vietnam after reunification, which it sees as a crucial part of its propaganda campaign surrounding Ho and the Party&#x27;s past.

The former capital of South Vietnam, Saigon, was officially renamed Ho Chi Minh City on May 1, 1975, one day after its capture, which officially ended the Vietnam War.
