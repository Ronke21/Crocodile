<text>Kemmerer is the largest city in and the county seat of Lincoln County, Wyoming, United States. Its population was 2,415 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Explorer John C. Frémont discovered coal in the area during his second expedition in 1843. The Union Pacific Coal Company opened the first underground mine in 1881 after construction of the Oregon Short Line Railroad from Granger to Oregon.

Patrick J. Quealy (1857–1930) immigrated from Ireland, founded Kemmerer as an &quot;independent town&quot; in 1897 when he was vice-president of the Kemmerer Coal Company, located south of the original townsite. He named the company and town after his financial backer, Pennsylvania coal magnate Mahlon S. Kemmerer (1843–1925). In 1950, the operation converted to strip mining and became the world&#x27;s largest open pit coal mine. In 1980 the Kemmerer Coal Co. was sold to the Pittsburg &amp; Midway Coal Company, a subsidiary of the Westmorland Coal Company. The pit remains in operation with an annual output of about 5 million tons.

Quealy sold lots in the townsite rather than lease them, which permitted the establishment of independent businesses. The company&#x27;s subsidiary, Frontier Supply Company, provided electricity by utilizing a used $1,150 generator acquired in Utah. In Wyoming, he and his wife became active in Democratic Party politics and in St. Patrick&#x27;s Church, for which the company donated land.

Quealy was the founding president of the First National Bank, established in 1900. Kemmerer Savings Bank was founded in 1909. Its president Asbury D. Hoskins was manager of the Blyth-Fargo-Hoskins Company, and was elected Wyoming state treasurer in 1919.

The J. C. Penney company store was founded in Kemmerer in 1902.

TerraPower selected Kemmerer, Wyoming as the site for a 345 MWe reactor using a molten salt energy storage system. The reactor can temporarily boost output to 500 MWe, enabling the plant to integrate with renewable resources. 
In June 2024 the site broke ground, beginning preparation for the as-yet unapproved reactor. 
It is estimated to cost $4 billion, with the DOE supplying half of that cost, and Bill Gates contributing $1 billion of his money.

<text>Chugwater is a town in Platte County, Wyoming, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town population was 175. The High Plains town is located 45 miles north of Cheyenne and 25 miles south of Wheatland.

==History==

The Chugwater area, with its proximity to Fort Laramie, was visited by some of the earliest Western expeditions, including that of Stephen Watts Kearny in 1845, and cattle were first wintered in the valley as early as 1859.

===Early expeditions to the Valley===

In 1870, the Hayden Expedition passed through what they referred to as &quot;the valley of the Chug&quot;. Along on the expedition was famed Hudson River School painter, Sanford Robinson Gifford (1823-1880), who sketched Chugwater Bluff, and later completed a large painting of it entitled &quot;Valley of the Chugwater&quot;. Hayden&#x27;s photographer, William Henry Jackson, noted in his journal that the Chugwater area was a wintering area for cattle: &quot;A very conspicuous feature which we notice in descending the valley of the Chug is the high bluff of Lower Cretaceous sandstone, which stretches away toward the northeast like a hugh wall. the jointage is so regular that it presents the appearance of massive mason-work gradually falling to decay. The sides of these sandstone walls are from 40 to 60 feet perpendicular, sometimes overhanging, large masses of which have broken off and fallen to the base. Their most striking feature, however is to weather into most picturesque castlllated forms. The valley of the Chug is 100 miles long, and is a favorite place to winter stock.&quot;

===First settlers &amp; the coming of the railroad===

The first settler in the valley is reported to have been James Bordeaux (1814-1878), who opened a general store in 1868, located at the crossroads where the road from Cheyenne forks into the roads leading to Fort Fetterman and to Fort Laramie. In 1884, the Swan Land and Cattle Co. was established, and in 1886, the Cheyenne and Northern Railway was chartered to serve points north of Cheyenne in Wyoming. It was as a result primarily of the Swan Land and Cattle Co., and the railroad, that the town of Chugwater grew up.

===Establishment of the town===

The town of Chugwater was surveyed and laid out by engineers for the Swan Land and Cattle Co. in 1886. The town grew slowly, but in 1904 a Masonic Hall was constructed, and the Grant Hotel opened in 1912. After the drought in the early 20th century, many of the early settlers left the area, but a number stayed, and by 1919 the town was incorporated.

As late as the 1940s, Chugwater was still a railroad stop where cattle were loaded for shipment east to the Union Stockyards in Omaha, Nebraska.

Clayton Danks, the model for the rider on the Wyoming Bucking Horse and Rider state symbol, worked on the 2-Bar Ranch near Chugwater early in the 20th century. The bucking horse on the logo, that he rode at the Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo in 1909, was Steamboat, who was foaled at Chugwater in 1896.

State Representative Robert Mills Grant was among those who have drove cattle into Chugwater.

The former Speaker of the Wyoming House of Representatives, Harold Hellbaum, farmed and ranched in Chugwater. He served in the state legislature from 1963 to 1977, with his last term as Speaker.

===Etymology of the town&#x27;s name===
Some historians hold that the name &quot;Chugwater&quot; is derived from a Mandan account of a bison hunt. According to this narrative, a chief was disabled during the hunt and his son took charge of the hunt or &quot;buffalo jump&quot;. Under his direction, hunters drove the bison over nearby cliffs; when the animals reached the ground below, a sound of &quot;chugging&quot; was heard by the hunters. The story concludes with an etymology: since a stream was near the base of the cliffs, the site of the stampede has been called &quot;the place&quot; or &quot;water at the place where the buffalo chug.&quot;

===The Chugwater horse called &quot;Steamboat&quot;===

The iconic black horse named &quot;Steamboat&quot;, who was the model for the bucking horse and rider motif on Wyoming license plates, came from the Tyrrell ranch located near Chugwater, and was given to the Cheyenne Frontier Days organization by the ranch&#x27;s general chairman, Ace V. Tyrrell. As a young horse, Steamboat sustained a nose injury, requiring removal of a bone fragment from a nostril, and as a result, developed a sound resembling the whistling of a steamboat whenever he bucked.

Steamboat was first ridden at a Frontier Days rodeo in 1909, by Clayton Danks (1879 – 1970) who was then working as a ranch hand in the Chugwater area, and was stabled for many years south of Chugwater near Cheyenne, in an historic barn owned and maintained by Mike and Linda Holst. The Wyoming license plate logo, showing Steamboat being ridden by Danks, is the longest-running license plate motif in the world.

The famous horse died in 1914, and is buried in Frontier Park in Cheyenne near bucking chute number 9, the only horse to be so honored with interment on park grounds. In 1975, Steamboat was inducted into the National Cowboy Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City, and in 1979, into the Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame in Colorado Springs. Steamboat and Danks are also on the logo for the University of Wyoming, and on the Wyoming state quarter.

Chugwater lost its only grocery and gas station when an SUV crashed into Horton&#x27;s Corner on December 30, 2012, resulting in a fire that burned the convenience store. The loss of the convenience store has forced residents to drive to Wheatland, or to Cheyenne, to buy basic necessities, such as groceries. The town also has erected electronic highway signs on Interstate 25 to inform motorists that gas can not be purchased in Chugwater, yet drivers still stop in the town to fill up based on inaccurate GPS information.

As of the summer of 2017, drivers can purchase fuel from unattended fuel islands 24/7 or check out the convenience store during business hours.

Chugwater Chili, which employs 15 people, lost a major seller of its packets of chili mix with the closure of Horton&#x27;s Corner.

<text>Wheatland is a town in and the county seat of Platte County in southeastern Wyoming, United States. The population was 3,588 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Before the late 19th century, the area around the future site of Wheatland was a flat, arid landscape with desert-like vegetation. In 1883 local rancher and judge Joseph M. Carey, along with Horace Plunkett, John Hoyt, Morton Post, Francis E. Warren, William Irvine, and Andrew Gilchrist, established the Wyoming Development Company. The company hoped to irrigate in the Wheatland Flats and profit from new development.

By the fall of 1883 an irrigation system was constructed on the Wheatland flats including a 2,380 foot long tunnel to divert water for irrigation into Bluegrass Creek and the first two of the system&#x27;s canals. The Cheyenne and Northern Railway line reached the Wheatland flats in July 1887, eventually extending to the Wyoming Central Railway at Wendover. The line was eventually sold to the Colorado and Southern Railway, controlled by the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad, and operated at Wheatland station. Lots in the town of Wheatland were auctioned in 1894. By 1915 many farms were established in the irrigation district and the population of the flats was 5,277.

In 1911 Platte County was created from a portion of Albany County, and Wheatland was selected as the county seat. The Platte County Courthouse was built in Wheatland in 1917.

The Wheatland Irrigation District is still the largest privately owned irrigation system in the country.

<text>Arvada is a census-designated place in Sheridan County, Wyoming, United States. The population was 33 at the 2020 census.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

== Climate ==
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Arvada has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps.

==History==
Arvada, Wyoming, is located on the west bank of the Powder River, about fifty miles northwest of 
Gillette. From 1888 to 1891, a stage line that ran from Sundance to
Buffalo crossed the Powder River on a ferry boat at the future site of Arvada. The town of Suggs, Wyoming, was established on the east bank of the river in 1891, and a post office opened September 14, 1891. Suggs was named for a local rancher.

During the summer of 1892, railroad crews working on the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad, built a bridge across the Powder River at Suggs, although the railroad had only reached Gillette at that point in time. Suggs quickly became an &quot;end of tracks town&quot; with bars, brothels, and gambling establishments.

During the Johnson County War of 1892, a group of Buffalo Soldiers from Fort Robinson took the train to Gillette, and marched to Suggs. There the black soldiers built &quot;Camp Bettens&quot; in spite of a hostile and racist local population. One black soldier was killed and two wounded in gun battles with locals in a fight known as the &quot;Battle of Suggs.&quot;
Camp Bettens was built in mid-June 1892, and was abandoned in mid-November.

When the railroad reached Suggs in 1892, railroad officials planned the new town of Arvada on the west bank of the Powder River, and Suggs was abandoned. The post office was moved from Suggs to Arvada on July 20, 1893.

The Arvada area has deposits of coal at a shallow depth, and in the early days, local wells produced natural gas in solution in the drinking water. The drinking water would catch on fire, and could burn.

In the first decade of the 21st century, Arvada was included by the United States Census Bureau in a census designated place which was then named for the town. In 2011, the US Postal Service proposed closing the Arvada post office along with 42 other Wyoming post offices.
==Demographics==
At the 2000 census, there were 33 people, 18 households and 9 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 15.4 per square mile (6.0/km2). There were 26 housing units at an average density of 12.1/sq mi (4.7/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 84.85% White, 6.06% Native American, and 9.09% from two or more races.

There were 18 households, of which 27.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 27.8% were married couples living together, 16.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 50.0% were non-families. 44.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 22.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.83 and the average family size was 2.56.

21.2% of the population were under the age of 18, 6.1% from 18 to 24, 24.2% from 25 to 44, 27.3% from 45 to 64, and 21.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 44 years. For every 100 females, there were 120.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 136.4 males.
The median family income was $87,857. The median income for all workers was $48,333. Females had a median income of $36,786. Male medium income was unreported. The per capita income for the CDP was $43,343. There were no families living below the poverty line. Five people reported Social Security income and none were on SSI. All workers were reported as being employed by governments.

<text>Big Horn is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Sheridan County, Wyoming, United States. The population was 457 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Big Horn is along the valley of Little Goose Creek. From 1866 to 1868, the military cutoff route of the Bozeman Trail crossed Little Goose Creek, where Big Horn was later located. The trail was used by travelers going to gold fields in Montana, but was plagued by Lakota attacks under Red Cloud. Fort Phil Kearny was established on Piney Creek, but continued harassment by the Lakota led to its abandonment and the withdrawal of the U.S. Army from the Powder River Country under the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868.

According to local historian Glenn Sweem, the main route of the Bozeman Trail did not pass through the site where Big Horn was later founded. It lay farther to the east and followed Prairie Dog Creek, eventually leaving that drainage and taking a course now occupied by 5th Street in Sheridan. From there the trail crossed Goose Creek and continued out Soldier Creek to present-day Keystone Road, eventually crossing Tongue River between where Ranchester and Dayton, Wyoming, were later located.

Little Goose Creek was the site of General George Crook&#x27;s camp after the Battle of the Rosebud against the Sioux and Cheyenne on June 17, 1876. Crook was fishing in the Bighorn Mountains on Tepee Creek while General George Custer fell to the Lakota and Cheyenne at the Little Bighorn, to the north.

The first settler in the Big Horn area was Oliver Perry Hanna, an adventurer, prospector, buffalo hunter, and Indian fighter who built a cabin on Hanna Creek in 1878. During the winter of 1878–79, he rode his horse north on the frozen Tongue River to hunt buffalo in the Yellowstone River Country. He participated in the massive hide harvest that wiped out the buffalo on the northern plains. His published recollections told of entire steamships loaded with buffalo hides floating down the Yellowstone River, as well as entire freight trains loaded with buffalo bones. After the buffalo hunting dried up, Hanna made a round trip to Fort Laramie to buy seed and a plow, becoming the first farmer to carve a furrow in what became Sheridan County. Hanna attracted many of the first settlers to Big Horn City, which was established in 1882. He operated the Oriental Hotel across the street from the Big Horn Mercantile for many years. William Frackelton, &quot;The Sagebrush Dentist&quot;, credited Hanna as the inspiration for the Crow Tribe&#x27;s involvement in a July 1902 reenactment of the Little Bighorn Battle in Sheridan.

According to local legend, Frank James and Big Nose George were hiding out along Little Goose Creek in 1878. Supposedly, things got &quot;too hot&quot; for them in the Black Hills, so they headed for the unsettled country near the Big Horn Mountains, where they encountered Hanna. This story has been passed down in the written recollections of early homesteaders, but has not been corroborated by outside historical references or the chronology of the James Gang. The Hilman family employed a mysterious man for a time, who regularly engaged in target practice with his pistol. The family believes this man was Butch Cassidy, based on a note left on his sudden departure from the ranch, which read: &quot;This is the only home I have ever known—Robert Parker.&quot;

Polo was first played in the area at a summer fair in Sheridan in 1893. Among the players in the match were ex-members of the Ninth Lancers division of the English Cavalry, who had brought polo from India.

At one time Big Horn had nearly 1,000 residents, a college, a brick factory, a newspaper, two churches, a hotel, a livery barn, two saloons, and a mercantile. It made a bid to be the seat of Sheridan County, but an 1888 runoff election gave the title to Sheridan. There was an exodus of residents and businesses around 1891 when it was learned that the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad was being surveyed through Sheridan. The railroad came to Sheridan in 1893, and since then Big Horn has been a satellite community of Sheridan. Today Big Horn has a mercantile, two bars, several bed-and-breakfasts, a women&#x27;s club, the Bozeman Trail Museum, a park, and an art museum several miles up Little Goose Creek at the Moncreiffe/Bradford Brinton Memorial Ranch.

Queen Elizabeth II stayed in Big Horn in October 1984 during a visit with her friends Lord and Lady Carnarvon at Senator and Mrs. Wallop&#x27;s Canyon Ranch.

==Geography==
Big Horn is on the eastern slope of the Big Horn Mountains, along Little Goose Creek, a tributary of the Tongue River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has an area of 1.8 square miles (4.7 km2), all land.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Big Horn has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 198 people, 72 households, and 51 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 70.3 people per square mile (27.1/km2). There were 76 housing units at an average density of 27.0/sq mi (10.4/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 97.98% White, 1.52% Native American, and 0.51% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.52% of the population. 22.8% were of Irish, 22.0% German, 19.7% English and 7.1% Polish ancestry according to Census 2000.

There were 72 households, out of which 43.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 63.9% were married couples living together, 8.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 27.8% were non-families. 22.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.75 and the average family size was 3.33.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 31.8% under the age of 18, 4.0% from 18 to 24, 23.2% from 25 to 44, 28.8% from 45 to 64, and 12.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 94.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 82.4 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $52,344, and the median income for a family was $56,875. Males had a median income of $50,938 versus $25,625 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $23,217. None of the families and 1.2% of the population were living below the poverty line.

== Culture ==
Founded in 1882, Big Horn caught the eye of well-to-do cattle and sheep ranchers who established operations along the base of the Big Horn Mountains in the 1890s. These included the sheep-breeding Moncreiffe brothers (from Clan Moncreiffe of the Scottish Highlands), Oliver Wallop (a member of the English Nobility), Goelet Gallatin (a descendant of Albert Gallatin US Treasury Secretary under Thomas Jefferson), and Bradford Brinton (a businessman from Chicago). These residents of higher means were a minority among other residents who were owners or tenants on small ranches and farms. This trend has continued to the present day, with a number of distinguished but low-profile executives mixing with ranchers and upper-middle class residents, many of whom work in Sheridan, Wyoming. Land prices have risen dramatically in recent years, resulting in the subdivision of pastures that once served dairy farms and mid-size ranches. The large ranches along the base of the mountains have remained intact and largely undeveloped due to the foresight of residents who have established conservation easements on their properties.

From autumn to spring, most of the community activity in Big Horn centers around its K-12 school, especially during football season. In the summer months the community attracts polo players from around the world, who enjoy the laid-back atmosphere of Big Horn Polo and the Flying H Polo Club in comparison to the more aristocratic experiences to be had in Long Island, Palm Beach, Santa Barbara, Spain, and Argentina. In May, the Big Horn Equestrian Center often hosts the Mars Big Horn Mountain Spring Cup, a soccer tournament for dozens of Wyoming traveling teams. During the tournament three polo fields are converted into 18 regulation-size soccer fields.

Though Big Horn is an unincorporated community, it has several civic organizations including the volunteer fire department, a non-denominational church, Women&#x27;s Club, Lion&#x27;s Club, and the Big Horn City Historical Society, which has over 400 members nationwide.

==Flying H Polo Club==
The Flying H Polo Club is one of the oldest polo clubs west of the Mississippi River. Polo first arrived in the area in the 1890s, brought by British expatriates, second sons who did not inherit estates but rather received remittance payments, who settled on local ranches. Several British men, including Oliver Wallop and the Moncreiffe brothers, began breeding polo ponies and hosting matches. A unique polo culture emerged in which local cowboys played the game with sons of lords. In the early 1980s, the Big Horn Equestrian Center opened.

==Schools==

Public education in Big Horn is provided by Sheridan County School District #1.

Big Horn has a K-12 campus serving nearly 400 students. Graduating classes number approximately 40 students. Standardized test scores are routinely among Wyoming&#x27;s highest due to small class size, excellent teachers and administration, and an involved community. Recent years have seen several National Merit Scholars and a graduate who was nominated for the Rhodes Scholarship. Several graduates are enrolled in doctoral programs and medical school. Big Horn has also earned a reputation for competitive athletic teams, with several state championships in football, volleyball, and girls basketball in the last decade.

Big Horn School uses a four-day week with classes from 8 am to 4 pm, and teacher in-service days on Friday. Though controversial at its inception, this non-traditional schedule allows for increased teacher training and curriculum development, and reduces the need for students to miss school to attend athletic contests and other extracurricular activities on Fridays. It also allows for a consistent three-day weekend, giving children more time to be nurtured in the home setting.

In 2009, the Wyoming School Facilities Commission approved plans for new school buildings to meet Big Horn&#x27;s future education needs. In August 2010, construction was completed on a new two-story combined middle school/high school. A new elementary school will also be built on the current school property, in the location of the old middle school/high school which was demolished in the summer of 2010.

<doc id="140193" wikidata="Q1017214" url="?curid=140193" title="Sheridan, Wyoming">
<text>Sheridan is a city in the U.S. state of Wyoming and the county seat of Sheridan County. The city is located halfway between Yellowstone Park and Mount Rushmore by U.S. Route 14 and 16. It is the principal town of the Sheridan, Wyoming, Micropolitan Statistical Area which encompasses all of Sheridan County. The 2020 census put the city&#x27;s population at 18,737, making it the 6th most populous city in Wyoming.

==History==
The city was named after General Philip Sheridan, Union cavalry leader in the American Civil War.
Several battles between US Cavalry and the Sioux, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Shoshone, and Crow Indian tribes occurred in the area in the 1860s and 1870s before the town was built.

In 1878, trapper George Mandel built a cabin on Big Goose Creek, since reconstructed in the Whitney Commons park near the Sheridan County Fulmer Public Library. Jack Dow surveyed the townsite for Sheridan in 1882, at the behest of John Loucks, first mayor of the town who had served under Gen. Sheridan.

In the early 1880s, the nearby town of Big Horn was larger in population. In 1888, Sheridan County split off of Johnson County, and voters chose Sheridan as the county seat in a run-off election. The arrival of the Burlington and Missouri Railroad in 1892 boosted Sheridan&#x27;s economic status, leading to the construction of the Sheridan Inn, where Buffalo Bill Cody was once a financial partner. Railroad maintenance facilities and railroad-tie treatment plants were significant employers in Sheridan&#x27;s first decades. The railroad created numerous side industries as well as export opportunities for raw materials. Maps of the day show Sheridan as part of the &quot;hinterland&quot; providing raw goods to cities like Chicago. For the next twenty years the economy and population boomed.

Numerous coal mines funded by Chicago investors opened along Tongue River north of Sheridan in the 1890s, sparking immigration, and a major building boom that built Sheridan&#x27;s brick downtown district. By 1910, an electric streetcar line, the only one in the state, connected the mining towns of Monarch, Dietz, and Acme to Sheridan.

Sheridan was settled by farmers from midwestern states like Illinois, and a few people who came up the cattle trails from Texas, like John B. Kendrick, who went on to be a cattle tycoon and Governor of Wyoming. Many immigrants from Poland, Italy, Greece, Germany, Mexico, and Japan settled in Sheridan, finding work in coal mines, railroad, or agriculture. One Muslim immigrant was Zarif Khan, a charismatic Afghani tamale and hamburger vendor from what became Pakistan whose neighborly generosity is still remembered in Sheridan. Many Polish families came from the Jaworzynka village in southern Poland. English immigrants who settled in the area were overwhelmingly farmers.

Agriculture played a major role in Sheridan County&#x27;s early economy. By the 1920s, Sheridan was an agricultural processing center for wheat, dairy, and sugar beets, with a stockyard for cattle shipping by rail. Many hobos rode the rails to Sheridan in the 1920s and 1930s, seeking employment in agriculture and ranches. From 1935 through 1939, Sheridan was considered the state capital of the proposed state of Absaroka, a secessionist movement that proved unsuccessful.

The role of underground coal mining declined in the 1950s when demand for coal to power steam locomotives declined due to adoption of diesel locomotives. As coal mine towns dwindled, many employees moved into Sheridan and found other lines of work. The economy boomed in the 1970s with the construction of strip mines along Tongue River in Montana. Many subdivisions were built on former small farms outside of Sheridan in the 1970s and 1980s as the dairy, wheat, and sugar beet industry consolidated to other areas in Montana and South Dakota with more production capacity.

Tourism has long been a significant factor in Sheridan&#x27;s economy and community life. Numerous guest ranches including Eaton&#x27;s Ranch hosted guests that arrived by rail. Books like &quot;Diary of a Dude Wrangler&quot; and &quot;Hell Among the Yearlings&quot; document this history. Many dude ranch guests moved to Sheridan permanently, leaving a lasting influence on the area&#x27;s economy, cultural life, and charity institutions. Sheridan has a number of local educational and community foundations, and almost 400 non-profits. Community-funded entities include a large Y.M.C.A. recreation center, and the WYO Theater.

In the 21st century, Sheridan is the economic center for a large area spanning three counties in north-central Wyoming and southern Montana. The town has a relatively diversified service economy — including government, healthcare, education, real estate, mining, and financial services, with a growing manufacturing sector — in contrast to many communities in Wyoming that rely mostly on natural resource extraction, government jobs, or national park tourism.

Residents today are employed in many fields including nearby coal mines, education, coal bed methane extraction, health care, retailing, banking; law firms, government, forestry, home construction, farming and ranching.

===Tourism===
Sheridan was ranked number one by the &quot;True West Magazine&quot; in 2006 among the Top Western Towns. It was ranked sixth in 2007. It is a vacation destination and a travel stop, due to its proximity to Interstate 90 and U.S. Route 14.

==Arts and culture==
Sheridan has a strong rodeo culture that draws from ranching history as well as a tradition of catering to the wild-west entertainment and shopping tastes of locals and tourists. The Sheridan WYO Rodeo was established in 1931 to provide entertainment and economic development following the success of the PK Ranch Rodeos in 1928 and 1929. It was a professional rodeo from the beginning but took a hiatus because of the Second World War in 1942 and 1943. It returned as a working cowboy rodeo in 1944 with a new name, the Bots Sots Stampede. In 1951 it resumed as the Sheridan-Wyo-Rodeo and became a professional rodeo again in 1966.

In 1953, the Miss Indian America Pageant and All-American Indian Days, &quot;an interracial project in human relations,&quot; was founded to celebrate American Indian culture.

The mix of cowboy and American Indian pageantry is still a major flavor in Sheridan&#x27;s annual summer celebrations, akin to rodeos in other reservation-border towns like Pendleton, Oregon. Sheridan&#x27;s milieu of cowboy-Indian cross-pollination and community relations provided part of the inspiration for the Walt Longmire mystery novel and TV series created by local author Craig Johnson.

The Sheridan WYO Rodeo, which began in 1931, is widely regarded as one of the top rodeos in the nation. It draws 25,000 guests to its annual, weeklong western celebration and performance each July at the Sheridan County Fairgrounds. The Sheridan WYO Rodeo recently launched a new Labor Day Weekend destination event called the Cowboy State Elite Rodeo, the only ERA League of Champions Rodeo event in an outdoor arena in the U.S.

An eight-foot-tall (2.5 m) replica of &quot;Leonardo&#x27;s horse&quot; was dedicated on August 20, 2014. The Wyoming Horse was commissioned by the Wyoming Community Foundation on behalf of the Sheridan Public Arts Committee.

Ten sites in and near Sheridan are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including:

== Representation in media ==
In 1984, Queen Elizabeth II visited Sheridan and stayed at Canyon Ranch as a guest of Wyoming U.S. Senator Malcolm Wallop, the brother of lifetime friend Lady Porchester whose husband, George Herbert, 8th Earl of Carnarvon, was the queen&#x27;s godson. It remained rather unpublicized before local reports of the Queen shopping at local stores caused international media outlets to hound the area, seeking to capture the obscure idea of British monarchy gathering at a ranch in the &quot;Old West&quot; nestled beneath the Rocky Mountains. Coverage drastically intensified the following day with the Brighton hotel bombing, a nearly successful assassination attempt on Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and reports of the Queen&#x27;s impromptu call with President Ronald Reagan to discuss the matter.

Several scenes of the 2006 film &quot;Flicka&quot; were filmed on location in Sheridan. It was based on the novel, &quot;My Friend Flicka&quot;.

Movies filmed in Sheridan include &quot;Into the Homeland&quot;, &quot;Wild Horses&quot; and &quot;Endangered Species&quot;.

<text>Story is a census-designated place (CDP) in Sheridan County, Wyoming, United States. As of the 2020 census, the CDP population was 903.

==History of the region==

The region around Story was part of the history of the American Frontier and the Old West, and of the conflicts between early settlers and the Plains Indians. The historic Bozeman Trail passed nearby in the mid-1860s, and Fort Phil Kearny, now a State Historic Site, lies just 5 miles south of town. Fort Sheridan was just to the north, near what is now the city of Sheridan.

Fort Phil Kearny, known to the Plains Indians as the &quot;hated post on the Little Piney&quot;, played an important role in Red Cloud&#x27;s War (1866-1868), and the area around the fort was the site of the Fetterman massacre and the Wagon Box Fight. The Fetterman Fight (with 81 men killed on the U.S. side) was the worst military defeat suffered by the U.S. Army on the Great Plains, until the Battle of the Little Bighorn ten years later.

The 1866 Fetterman Fight marked a key victory of the Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho Indians over soldiers of the United States Army, and the 1867 Wagon Box Fight involved Lakota Sioux and soldiers from nearby Fort Phil Kearny. Fort Phil Kearny, including the nearby sites of the Fetterman engagement and the Wagon Box Fight, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960.

With the advent of the automobile in the early 1900s, the area around Story became, and has remained, a popular destination in Wyoming for tourists, Boy Scout troops and others for camping, fishing, and other outdoor recreational activities.
==Geography==

Banner lies three miles to the northeast, and the Bighorn Mountains (and Bighorn National Forest) are to Story&#x27;s west. The town is accessible via U.S. Route 87 (cosigned with Wyoming Highway 193).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the census-designated place has a total area of 7.1 square miles (18.46 km2), all land.

===Wildlife===
White-tailed deer thrive and flourish and groups of them often stroll down the streets or lounge on people’s lawn. There are also lots of turkeys. Mountain lions and black bears exist in the areas surrounding the community.
===Climate===

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Story has a warm-summer humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 887 people, 420 households, and 272 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 64.6 people per square mile (24.9/km2). There were 667 housing units at an average density of 48.6/sq mi (18.7/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 98.87% White, 0.11% African American, 0.34% Native American, 0.23% Asian, 0.23% from other races, and 0.23% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.35% of the population.

There were 420 households, out of which 20.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 57.1% were married couples living together, 4.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 35.2% were non-families. 30.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.11 and the average family size was 2.56.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 17.4% under the age of 18, 4.2% from 18 to 24, 21.2% from 25 to 44, 34.9% from 45 to 64, and 22.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 48 years. For every 100 females, there were 109.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 103.0 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $33,125, and the median income for a family was $45,000. Males had a median income of $29,028 versus $23,958 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $20,053. About 12.1% of families and 15.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 18.6% of those under age 18 and 11.5% of those age 65 or over.

==Education==
Public education in the community of Story is provided by Sheridan County School District #2. Although Story&#x27;s census-designated place (CDP) boundary extends onto land that is zoned to Sheridan County School District #1, the populated areas are served by Sheridan County School District #2.

Story Elementary School is located in the community and serves students in grades K-5. Secondary school students attend Sheridan Junior High School (grades 6-8) and Sheridan High School (grades 9-12), which are located in nearby Sheridan.

Story has a public library, a branch of the Sheridan County Public Library System.

==Fire and rescue==
The Story Volunteer Fire Rescue Department provides fire suppression and rescue services for the heavily forested community of Story and the surrounding area, which is designated as by the State of Wyoming as the Story Fire Protection District.

==Fish hatchery and visitor center==

The Wyoming State Game &amp; Fish Department operates a fish hatchery and visitor center, which is open to the public, on South Piney Creek, two miles west of Story on Fish Hatchery Road - State Route 194.

==Transportation==

===Highways===
* Interstate 90
* U.S. Highway 87
* (Sheridan Highway)
* (Fish Hatchery Road)
* (North Piney Road)

:In the late 1990s, a section of US 87 between Buffalo and Sheridan near Pilot Hill was closed due to recurring landslides, and State Route 193 began being used as an alternate route. The State of Wyoming petitioned the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) to officially reroute US 87 over Highway 193, but AASHTO denied the petition. Since then, an officially designated detour for US 87 has followed Highway 193 through Story, and it appears unlikely US 87 will be reconstructed in the foreseeable future due to additional, and recurring landslides in the area, as well as the potential costs.

===Airports===

The Sheridan County Airport is 14 miles north of Story, just south of Sheridan, with direct passenger flights available daily to Denver. The other two nearest airports are Worland Muni Airport and Gillette-Campbell County Airport.

<text>Big Piney is a town in Sublette County, Wyoming, United States. The population was 552 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Big Piney is the oldest settlement in Sublette County. It was founded in 1879, when rancher Daniel B. Budd and his partner Hugh McKay came with a thousand head of cattle from Nevada hoping to ship them, but got caught instead in severe winter weather in the Green River Valley. The following year, Dan Budd relocated his family to what became Big Piney.

The town was named after Big Piney Creek. The creek took its name from the pine trees growing along the banks of the creek.

Cattle and oil have traditionally been the two primary industries for the area.

The Wardell Buffalo Trap, a canyon used by Native Americans to trap bison, is in the vicinity of Big Piney. Its potential archeological value led to its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

===Historical documentaries===
In 1987, actress Glenn Close, daughter of one of the town&#x27;s doctors, co-produced a documentary about the vanishing cowboy of the American West, entitled, &quot;Do You Mean There Are Still Real Cowboys?&quot; The film focused on several generations of cattle ranching families in Big Piney. It was first shown in 1988 as part of the PBS television series &quot;The American Experience&quot; and was narrated by actor Robert Redford.

Big Piney was one of four international locations chosen for the 2006 documentary film &quot;Comrades in Dreams&quot;, about the impact of local movie theaters in four different cultures (North Korea, Burkina Faso, India and Wyoming).

==Geography==
Big Piney is located at (42.539768, −110.115350).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
Sometimes known as the &quot;Ice Box of the Nation,&quot; Big Piney has one of the coldest climates among inhabited locations in the Lower 48.
Big Piney experiences a semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;) with long, cold, dry winters and short, warm summers. Because of the high elevation and aridity, large diurnal temperature differences are a regular feature of Big Piney&#x27;s climate. Precipitation is very low and somewhat concentrated in the warmer months.

==Demographics==
===2010 census===
As of the census of 2010, there were 552 people, 228 households, and 131 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 282 housing units at an average density of .

<text>Daniel is a census-designated place in Sublette County, Wyoming, United States. The population was 150 at the 2010 census.

The town lies on U.S. Route 189, in the Green River valley as the water flows out of the Gros Ventre Range to Daniel&#x27;s north and the Wind River Mountains to the town&#x27;s east. Horse Creek, a Green River tributary that joins just west of Daniel, has its headwaters west in the Salt River Range. Thus bordered on three sides by nearby mountains, Daniel lies in the very northern, highest part of the large basin that defines much of southern Wyoming. Wyoming Highway 354 is a west-east road that intersects US Highways 189 and 191 north of town.

==History==
On July 5, 1840, Father Pierre-Jean De Smet offered the first Holy Mass (an important Christian worship ceremony) in Wyoming. A monument to the event stands on its site one mile east of Daniel.

The Rocky Mountain Rendezvous, a gathering of fur trappers and traders, was held in Daniel six times from 1833 to 1840.

==Geography==
Daniel is located at (42.865172, −110.070921).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 5.1 square miles (13.2 km2), all land.

==Climate==

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 89 people, 41 households, and 27 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 16.3 people per square mile (6.3/km2). There were 52 housing units at an average density of 9.5/sq mi (3.7/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 100.00% White.

There were 41 households, out of which 24.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.7% were married couples living together, 9.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 34.1% were non-families. 31.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 4.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

==Education==
Public education in the community of Daniel is provided by Sublette County School District #1.

== Recreation ==
Local recreational activities include hiking, fishing, and, controversially, competitive wildlife extermination events that are marketed as predator control, much to the chagrin of conservationists and international animal rights organizations.

== Cultural Event ==
While once known for the Rocky Mountain Rendezvous, where trappers and traders gathered in the 19th century, Daniel, Wyoming has recently gained notoriety for hosting events that celebrate the mass killing of native wildlife, a development that has drawn significant backlash from animal welfare advocates.

== Modern History ==
In recent years, Daniel, Wyoming has become internationally recognized not only for its historic fur trade gatherings but also as a hotbed of ethically questionable predator control practices, including the 2024 torture and killing of a wolf that drew worldwide condemnation. The town has since leaned into its newfound reputation by hosting events such as the Song Dog Shootout, a competitive coyote hunting contest that many consider an unintentional tourism deterrent.

<text>Granger is a town along Blacks Fork near the western edge of Sweetwater County, Wyoming, United States. The population was 139 at the 2010 census. It is located near the confluence of the Blacks Fork and the Hams Fork rivers. The geography of the area is flat with semi-arid scrub.

==Early history: 1834–1868==
Although the population has always been small, the site is located at the intersection of the Oregon Trail and the Overland Stage Trail and it was chosen for a stage coach station. The station, which was built of stone and adobe in 1856, was in operation when Mark Twain passed through, and still stands today. The Pony Express used this station as a stopover in 1861-62. Later, in 1868, it became a stop on the railroad, which was when it started to be called Granger.

The area of what is present-day Granger had significance to the mountain men who trapped in the early years of the American West. It was chosen as the site of their annual rendezvous in 1834 (the rendezvous was still somewhat spread out, as each supplier set up camp at different location along the river). The American Fur Company, among other suppliers, were present, and American Indians and trappers traded furs for goods. Several weeks were spent recounting events from the previous year and reveling in assorted amusements, while lubricated with liquor. The records show that the event occurred at the junction of the Hams Fork and Blacks Fork rivers.

<text>Green River is a city in and the county seat of Sweetwater County, Wyoming, United States, in the southwestern part of the state. The population was 11,825 at the 2020 census. It is the 7th most populous city in Wyoming. 

==History==

The townsite of Green River, Dakota Territory was platted by the Union Pacific Railroad in 1867. Although the Territory of Wyoming was created on July 25, 1868, the Town of Green River was incorporated on August 21,1868 under the laws of the previous Territory of Dakota since the laws of the Wyoming Territory had yet to be written. The Town of Green River was re-incorporated on June 10, 1891 under the laws of the State of Wyoming to remove any ambiguity.

The Union Pacific Railroad reached Green River on October 1, 1868, and was supposed to be the site of a division point for the railroad. Railroad officials were surprised to find that a town of 2000 residents and permanent adobe buildings had been established there, likely requiring costly negotiations for railroad land. They moved the division point west, creating the town of Bryan, on the Blacks Fork of the Green River. Just when Green River was on the verge of becoming a ghost town, Blacks Fork dried up during a drought and the railroad was forced to move the division point back to Green River to ensure adequate water for its steam locomotives. Bryan became the ghost town.

On May 24, 1869, John Wesley Powell launched the Powell Geographic Expedition from Green River.

On November 16, 1931, the Town of Green River passed the Green River Ordinance that prohibited door-to-door selling. Other towns across the country would adopt the ordinance.

==Economy==
The Green River Basin contains the world&#x27;s largest known deposit of trona ore. Soda ash mining from trona veins 900 and deep is a major industrial activity in the area, employing over 2000 persons at five mines. The mining operation is less expensive for production of soda ash in the United States than the synthetic Solvay process, which predominates in the rest of the world. The trona in Sweetwater County was created by an ancient body of water known as Lake Gosiute. Over time, the lake shrank. With the loss of outflows, highly alkaline water (salt brine) began to evaporate, depositing the beds of trona.

The four mines are run by these companies:
* Tata Chemicals Ltd.
* Genesis Alkali LLC
* Ciner Resources LP
* Solvay Chemicals Inc.

The Green River Basin also has large oil shale and natural gas reserves, which remain virtually untouched due to the high cost of extracting the oil from the hard shale formations. However, an increase in oil prices in 2008 and a national desire to become more energy independent led to an increase in well drilling and oil exploration. Expansion growth from Halliburton and Exxon, as well as other oil companies, created a mini-boom for Green River and its sister city, Rock Springs.

The 80MW Sweetwater Solar project near Green River is &quot;the first utility-scale solar farm&quot; in Wyoming. It was slated to come online in 2019. Concerns have been raised about its impact on antelope migration.

==Arts and culture==
===Flaming Gorge Days===

Every year, on the last full weekend of June, Green River hosts Flaming Gorge Days. The festival features concerts, 3-on-3 basketball, Red Desert Road Runner 5K race, Festival in the Park, among other activities. Past musical performances at the festival have included Poison, Tesla, Everclear, Head East, Neal McCoy, REO Speedwagon, Josh Gracin, Chris LeDoux and Trick Pony.

==Government==
Green River&#x27;s government consists of a six-member city council, each of whom are elected from one of three wards. Each ward elects two members. The mayor is elected in a citywide vote. The city council was criticized in 2007 for its handling of a smoking ban, which caused several residents to question the council&#x27;s motives.

The Mayor of Green River is Pete Rust, who was elected in November 2014.

=== Animal welfare ===

Green River is one of the last cities in the United States that still uses a gas chamber for euthanizing animals at its municipal shelter. The practice, widely condemned by animal rights groups, has faced protests from citizens and activists. Despite offers to fund a transition to humane euthanasia methods, city officials have refused to discontinue gas chamber use.

==Education==
Public education in the City of Green River is provided by Sweetwater County School District #2. Schools serving the city include: Harrison Elementary, Truman Elementary, Washington Elementary, Monroe Intermediate School, Lincoln Middle School, and Green River High School. There is also one alternative high school campus - Expedition Academy.

Western Wyoming Community College is located in nearby Rock Springs and maintains an extension center in Green River.

Green River has a public library, a branch of the Sweetwater County Library System.

==Media==

Green River is served by two print publications: &quot;The Green River Star&quot; (a weekly newspaper published in Green River) and the &quot;Rock Springs Daily Rocket-Miner&quot;.

Four larger radio stations originate from Green River, three FM stations (KYCS, KZWB and KFRZ) as well as one AM station (KUGR). Stations from Rock Springs, Wyoming can also be heard in Green River.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

Green River lies along Interstate 80 (I-80), a major transcontinental freeway that crosses southern Wyoming. It was designated in 1956 and constructed in phases to replace U.S. Route 30, the previous transcontinental highway on the corridor. The section around Green River was opened on October 28, 1966, and included the construction of the Green River Tunnel, a pair of tunnels that ran . The tunnels closed on February 14, 2025, after a mass collision involving 26 vehicles started a fire that killed 3 people. Other highways in the city include Highway 530, which connects to Flaming Gorge, and Interstate 80 Business, which uses the old route of U.S. Route 30 through Green River.

The city government owns a Greater Green River Intergalactic Spaceport, a public use airstrip south of the town on Highway 530. It was originally named Green River 48U for its Federal Aviation Administration identifier until 1994, when the city council passed a resolution to designate the airport as a spaceport. The same resolution included language with an &quot;offer of sanctuary&quot; to residents of Jupiter due to the impending collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9. The airport has a runway and a commemorative sign that has been replaced several times due to theft.

This plant is connected to the grid by numerous 500kv transmission lines.
==Almond Stage Station==
Also located in Point of Rocks are the remnants of the original Almond Stage Station, built in 1862 at the behest of Ben Holladay. Holladay wished to move his stage coach line further south because of repeated attacks by Indians. The station was constructed of local sandstone with a sod-covered roof, which allowed it to survive at least one attack and attempted burning. In 1868, the station was converted to a stop along the transcontinental railroad and the Overland Trail. When mining declined in the area the station was sold and used as a private home before being absorbed by the Wyoming State Parks and restored. The Point of Rocks Stage Station was never used as a Pony Express stop at any time and was not even on the route of the Pony Express.

<text>Rock Springs is a city in Sweetwater County, Wyoming, United States. The population was 23,526 at the 2020 census, making it the fifth most populous city in the state of Wyoming, and the most populous city in Sweetwater County. Rock Springs is the principal city of the Rock Springs micropolitan statistical area, which has a population of 37,975. Rock Springs is known as the Home of 56 Nationalities because of the influx of immigrants from all over the world who came to work in the coal mines that supplied the fuel to power the steam engines of the Union Pacific Railroad. The city&#x27;s rich cultural heritage is celebrated each summer on International Day, a festival where the foods, costumes, and traditions of residents&#x27; ancestors are recreated and enjoyed at Bunning Park in downtown Rock Springs.

Rock Springs is the site of Western Wyoming Community College and Wyoming&#x27;s Big Show, a yearly event with a carnival and concerts which is held at the Sweetwater County Events Complex.

Rock Springs is located in an energy-rich region with many oil and natural gas wells.

==History==
Rock Springs derives its name from a rock spring which flowed in the Number 6 district in the northern part of town. An erroneous story had indicated that the spring was found by a lost Pony Express rider, but the spring station was known to Jim Bridger before 1860; the Overland Stage station was located nearby. The spring disappeared when the coal mine operations interrupted the underground flow. Later an &#x27;S&#x27; was added to the name making it &quot;Rock Springs&quot;.

Through the years, water supplies have been a problem to Rock Springs. In the early days, Ed Cleg hauled domestic water from the sulfur spring north of Rock Springs and charged $.25 a barrel. With the mining operations, the water flow was interrupted and water was hauled from Green River and Point of Rocks. Beginning in 1887, a water main was started from the Green River and completed in 1888 to bring a continuous supply of water to Rock Springs.

Rock Springs has a multi-ethnic heritage; locals called it the 57 Variety Town. The first immigrants were brought in by the railroad and coal mining companies. The Welsh and British people were initially most populous. Later, Irish, Blacks and refugees from the Southern part of the United States also came. The Scandinavian people were represented with a heavy Mormon recruitment.

One of the worst incidents of anti-immigrant violence in American history, known as the Rock Springs Massacre, occurred on September 2, 1885, whereby White miners slaughtered their Chinese counterparts due to anti-Chinese sentiment. There are still remains of the old coal mining towns outside of Rock Springs.

On June 10, 1892, Rock Springs National Bank opened on 515 S Main St, across from the Union Pacific depot. The original sandstone building was designed by Mayor H.H. Edgar who chose an Italianate style. In 1907, when John Hay Sr. assumed control of the business, the location moved to C Street. RSNB owned the original building until 1921 when it was sold to Anton Mengoni. Hay Sr. navigated the bank through the Great Depression and World War II, before retiring in 1947. John Hay Jr., his son, then took control of the bank, having to control wild growth during Wyoming&#x27;s massive energy boom in the 1970s. Another of Hay Sr.&#x27;s sons was Archibald (Archie) Hay. Archibald was killed in France by a German plane in 1918. In his memory, Post 24 of the American Legion, chartered in 1919, was named Archie Hay Post.

Rock Springs was featured on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in 1977 due to corruption within the Police Department and City Government. A grand jury was called into session. The Sheriff of Sweetwater County, James Stark, testified and no wrongdoing was ever found. A follow-up was filmed 20 years later for the show &quot;City Confidential&quot;. The episode was named &quot;Rock Springs: Deadly Draw in the Wild West&quot;.

<text>Table Rock is a ghost town in Sweetwater County, Wyoming, United States. The former town is part of a census-designated place. In the 2000 census, it had a population of 82, but the 2010 census reported a population of 0.

==Geography==
Table Rock lies along Interstate 80 in the Red Desert Basin, between Rock Springs and Wamsutter.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Table Rock has a total area of 6.8 square miles (17.6 km2), all land.

==History==
Table Rock was built in the late 1970s by Colorado Interstate Gas (CIG) as a company town, to house workers during an area boom and housing shortage. It was built just north of the company&#x27;s natural gas processing plant. CIG provided employees three- or four-bedroom homes free of charge and built a community center. The village began to decline after El Paso Corp. acquired CIG in 2001. In 2003, the plant and town were bought by Anadarko Petroleum, which then decided not to operate the village. Table Rock was closed in July 2003. The housing units were sold to real estate developers, and some of the houses were moved to Rock Springs.

The remaining homes were demolished in late August 2011, leaving the community center as the only structure standing on the village site, and it was scheduled to be moved.

==Demographics==
The census of 2000 did not separate the town from the larger CDP, but there were 82 people, 32 households, and 23 families residing in the entire CDP.

There were 32 households, out of which 43.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 65.6% were married couples living together, 3.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.1% were non-families. 28.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and none had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.56 and the average family size was 3.17.

<text>Jackson is a resort town in Teton County, Wyoming, United States. The population was 10,760 at the 2020 census, up from 9,577 in 2010. It is the largest town in Teton County and its county seat. Jackson is the principal town of the Jackson, WY-ID Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes Teton County in Wyoming and Teton County in Idaho. The town is often called Jackson Hole, which is the name of the valley in which it is located. Jackson is a popular tourist destination due to its proximity to the ski resorts Jackson Hole Mountain, Snow King Mountain, and Grand Targhee, as well as Grand Teton National Park and Yellowstone National Park.

==History==
Jackson was originally populated by Native American tribes including the Shoshoni, Crow, Blackfeet, Bannock, and Gros Ventre. In the early 1800s, the locality became a prime area for trappers and mountain men to travel through, one example being John Colter. After being discharged from the Corps of Discovery of the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1806 at Fort Mandan, in present-day North Dakota, Colter visited Jackson Hole during the winter of 1807/1808. Among other mountain men who visited the valley include Jim Bridger, Jedediah Smith, and William Sublette who are responsible for many of the names in the area. David Edward Jackson gave his name to the valley after a winter spent on the shores of Jackson Lake.

As part of the Hayden Expedition of 1871 and 1872, William Henry Jackson took the first photographs of the Teton Range and Yellowstone. His photographs along with the sketches by Tom Moran, were important evidence to convince Congress to protect Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone National Park became the first National Park in 1872. Grand Teton National Park was created in 1929 and greatly expanded in 1950 after John D. Rockefeller Jr. purchased and then donated over .

The town of Jackson was named in 1894 and incorporated in 1914. Some of the early buildings remain and can be found throughout the area of the Town Square.

The town of Jackson elected an all-woman city government (including town council and mayor, who in turn appointed women to town marshal, town clerk and treasurer) in 1920.

The first ski rope tow was built at Teton Pass in 1937 and Snow King Resort was established in 1930. Teton County has three excellent ski areas including Jackson Hole Mountain Resort in Teton Village, Grand Targhee Ski, and Summer Resort located on the western slope of the Tetons as well as Snow King Resort.

The town of Jackson is the county seat of Teton County and the only incorporated municipality in the region. Less than 3% of land in Teton County is privately owned. Of the in Teton County, 97% are federally or state owned/managed.

In 2009, the town of Jackson was designated as a Preserve America Community. This designation recognizes that, as a community, the town protects and celebrates its heritage, uses historic assets for economic development, and encourages people to experience and appreciate local historic resources.

Jackson is surrounded by the Teton and Gros Ventre mountain ranges. The Teton Range is commonly associated with Jackson Hole and is a popular sightseeing attraction for many visitors. The Gros Ventre Range, by contrast, is geologically older than the Tetons and has a much broader width which encompasses huge expanses of wilderness; it is not as easily accessible.

Soils at Jackson Hole are mostly dark, excessively drained, moderately alkaline gravelly loam of the Greyback series.

Flat Creek, a tributary of the Snake River, runs through the town.

===Climate===
Jackson experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;), with warm summers and very cold winters. Due to its location in a very narrow river valley, Jackson and the rest of the Snake headwaters experience a unique microclimate that gets considerably more precipitation–much of it snow–than the majority of Wyoming and has higher humidity during much of the year. Its elevation is also responsible for extreme differences between day and night temperatures, which makes the climate very close to being classified as subarctic (Köppen Dfc). Extreme temperatures range from on December 20, 1924, to on July 17, 1934, and July 20, 1934, and on average 236.0 mornings fall below freezing and 34.7 of these below ; the 1991 to 2020 average window for subzero Fahrenheit temperatures is from November 22 to March 3, while the window for freezing temperature is from August 22 to July 5, but freezing temperature have been recorded on every single day of the year except for July 25.

Snowfall averages . The highest monthly total has been in January 1969, and the most in one season being between July 1966 and June 1967.

==Demographics==

==Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium==

Since 1978, the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank has held an annual economic summit at Jackson (Hole) that is globally known as the Jackson Hole Economic Summit or officially as the &quot;Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium&quot;. Attendees include prominent central bankers, finance ministers, and academics from around the world.

==In popular culture==

Movies shot in Jackson include &quot;The Big Trail&quot; (1930), &quot;The Big Sky&quot; (1952), &quot;Shane&quot; (1953), &quot;Any Which Way You Can&quot; (1980), &quot;Rocky IV&quot; (1985), &quot;Ghosts Can&#x27;t Do It&quot; (1990), and &quot;Django Unchained&quot; (2012). It is also a major location in the action-adventure video game &quot;The Last of Us&quot; (2013) and its sequel (2020), in which it is home to a large community of survivors in a post-apocalyptic world; however, scenes set in Jackson in the game&#x27;s television adaptation (2023) were instead shot in the Canadian town of Canmore, Alberta, which doubled for Jackson.

Jackson has gained notability since a livestream of its town square went viral on YouTube in 2016, leading to much fascination with the town&#x27;s elk antler arches and unusually high prevalence of red pickup trucks. It first went viral when a sheriff stopped at a red light in the early hours of the morning, got out of his patrol car, and dabbed towards the camera before leaving.

<text>Evanston is a city in and the county seat of Uinta County, Wyoming, United States. The population was 11,747 at the 2020 census. It is located near the border with Utah.

==History==

Evanston was named after James A. Evans, a civil engineer for the Union Pacific Railroad. Another source maintains it is named for John Evans, second Governor of the Territory of Colorado. The town was founded during the construction of the first transcontinental railroad. The railroad arrived in the area in November 1868, and Harvey Booth opened a saloon/restaurant in a tent near what is now Front Street. By December the rails had reached Evanston and the first train arrived December 16. However, orders were later handed down by the railroad managers to move the end of the line 12 miles west, to Wahsatch. Within three days, most all of Evanston had moved to Wasatch. It appeared that Evanston would become another &quot;end of the tracks&quot; town. In June 1869 headquarters returned to Evanston and it continued to grow. Later in 1871, a machine shop and roundhouse were constructed, giving Evanston a longevity not shared by many other railroad towns.

Abundant timber and water along the Bear River made Evanston a refueling station for cross-country locomotives. Coal was mined in Almy, a few miles north of Evanston. Similar to other railroad towns in Wyoming, early Evanston had a large population of Chinese Railroad Workers – in Evanston they lived on the north side of the railroad tracks in a small &quot;China town.&quot; Over time, the Chinese population dwindled; the last two members of the first generation of immigrants died in the 1930s.

Evanston was a major stop on the Lincoln Highway. The highway ran east to west from East Service Rd to Bear River Dr, on Front St to Harrison Dr, to Wasatch Rd southwest to Echo Canyon in Utah. It can still be seen along Interstate 80, which follows the railroad tracks in this area.

Evanston underwent massive growth and change during an oil boom in the 1980s. Recent drilling for natural gas has also revitalized the economy of the area. Union Tank Car works on railroad tank cars near the Union Pacific Railroad Complex, locally referred to as the old roundhouse. There are restored railroad buildings, including a roundhouse, in the downtown area. One of the more recent restorations include 1011 Front Street. This building, located in historic downtown Evanston, is across the street from the museum in Depot Square. Another restoration project included the rebuilding of the Joss house in Depot Square in 1990; the original had been destroyed in a fire in 1922.

<text>Fort Bridger is a census-designated place (CDP) in eastern Uinta County, Wyoming, United States. The population was 354 at the 2020 census. The community takes its name from the eponymous Fort Bridger, established in 1842, which is located within the boundaries of the CDP.

==History==
Fort Bridger was established in 1843 by Jim Bridger and Louis Vasquez. It served as a trading post for those who were traveling westward along the Oregon Trail, as well as LDS Pioneers, the Pony Express, the Lincoln Highway, and the transcontinental railroad. The fort was also commonly used to trade with the local Native Americans.

The fort was not very glamorous, it was even a disappointment to most travelers. It was simply two log cabins about in length connected by a fence to hold horses. Most visitors complained about insufficient supplies and it being overpriced. They did, however, have a blacksmith&#x27;s shop that many travelers took advantage of.

By 1858, Fort Bridger became a military outpost. Today, Fort Bridger is a historic site. Jim Bridger’s trading post is reconstructed, along with other historic buildings from the military. There is also a museum with gift shops available for visitors.

<text>Ten Sleep is a town in Washakie County, Wyoming, United States. It is located in the Bighorn Basin in the western foothills of the Bighorn Mountains, approximately east of Worland and west of Buffalo.

The population was 260 at the 2020 census.

==Culture==

Near the entrance to nearby Ten Sleep Canyon is the former site of the Girl Scout National Center West, a portion of which was one of the largest encampments in the world at . A part of that site is now owned and operated by the Nature Conservancy as the Tensleep Preserve, with facilities for workshops and seminars.

Ten Sleep Mercantile, also known as &quot;Ten Sleep Hardware&quot;, is an example of a typical small-town general store and it has been the focal point of the town since it was built in 1905 by H.T. Church. The building is an example of the tall, narrow and deep commercial buildings commonly found in small American towns. From 1919 to 1943 the store was operated by Paul Frison, who served as mayor of Ten Sleep and as a Wyoming state legislator.

The area continues to thrive as a ranching community. Other industries include mineral extraction (bentonite) and tourism. Logging and other small businesses have dwindled, leaving just a handful of small businesses supporting the community. Three cafes/restaurants, two bars, two motels, a historic hardware store, campground, bank, and a gas station/ convenience store offer the primary services for visitors and locals.

With a diversity of outdoor opportunities, locals mingle with tourists everywhere. Beyond the traditional activities such as hunting, fishing and horseback riding, outdoor enthusiasts today are found within a few miles of Ten Sleep participating in rock climbing, kayaking, spelunking, mountain biking, off-highway vehicle riding and camping, which draw explorers from near and far. Kids still wade in Ten Sleep Creek at the City Park and catch trout anywhere along the stream as it meanders through town. Mid-summer is celebrated by tubing (floating the creek on inner tubes).

Annual celebrations include a two-day rodeo and parade, hinging on the 4th of July celebration of Independence Day of the United States. The town&#x27;s population temporarily quadruples over this period, as tourists and area residents gather to celebrate. The main street is also closed to through traffic to accommodate live music that lasts into the wee hours of the morning. Another annual tradition is NoWoodStock, held the second weekend of August. An eclectic mixture of folk, bluegrass, swing, jazz and rock makes this wonderful celebration of music a destination for locals, neighbors and worldwide tourists.

Ten Sleep has a microbrewery named Ten Sleep Brewing Company, which began brewing in October 2013 and produces various beers.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Ten Sleep has a hot-summer humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfa&quot; on climate maps. The hottest temperature recorded in Ten Sleep was on July 13, 2005, while the coldest temperature recorded was on December 22, 1990.

Ten Sleep was an American Indian rest stop, so called because it was 10 days&#x27; travel, or “10 sleeps,” from Fort Laramie (southeast), Yellowstone National Park (west-northwest), and the Indian Agency on the Stillwater River in Montana (northwest). There are numerous archeological sites throughout the area, with frequent discoveries of artifacts such as arrowheads, pictographs and petroglyphs.

Ten Sleep was also the site of the Spring Creek Raid, one of the last feuds of the West&#x27;s Sheep and Cattlemen&#x27;s War. It was there in March 1909 that cattlemen attacked sheep herders and their flock, killing three men and shooting hundreds of the sheep. Caught and convicted, this was the end of major conflict, although it was many years before the two livestock growers&#x27; groups resolved their differences.

==Archaeology/paleontology==
Rich in prehistory, fossil specimens of dinosaurs, plants and sea-life are prolific throughout the region. One such area, Big Cedar Ridge, is open to the public for exploration and collection for personal use.

==Geology==
The yellowish-gray to white sandstone which forms much of Ten Sleep Canyon is named the Tensleep Formation (Pennsylvanian), and dominates much of the western slope of the Bighorn Mountains. The prominent red sandstone, such as Signal Cliff just west of Ten Sleep, as well as the dirt hills all along the west slope of the Bighorn Mountains are of the Chugwater Formation (Triassic). Above Chugwater, follows the marine Jurassic Sundance Formation and the terrestrial Late Jurassic Morrison Formation with dinosaurs. Called the &quot;Painted Desert&quot; or &quot;Colored Hills&quot; by locals, the Cloverly Formation is finely granuled sandstone, clay and &quot;gumbo&quot;. The Cloverly formations contains bands of various mineral colors ranging from greens and grays to red and violets, and are closely associated with strata containing dinosaur fossils. Numerous signs along U.S. 16 from Buffalo, through Ten Sleep and west to Worland identify the various geologic formations and their millennia.

Newcastle was founded in 1889 as a mining town and a railroad town as the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad expanded westward. It is named after Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, England, an important coal shipping port. President Teddy Roosevelt visited Newcastle in 1903.

U.S. Route 85 once ran south from the city to the east of the rail track, crossing them over a five span wide flange steel girder bridge constructed in 1929. The portion of US Hwy 85 from Newcastle to just south of the bridge was realigned to the west bypassing the bridge in 1963.

<doc id="140256" wikidata="Q8013" url="?curid=140256" title="Ebonics (word)">
<text>Ebonics (a portmanteau of the words &quot;ebony&quot; and &quot;phonics&quot;) is a term created in 1973 by a group of black scholars who disapproved of the negative terms being used to describe their type of language. Since the 1996 controversy over its use by the Oakland School Board, the term &quot;Ebonics&quot; has primarily been used to refer to the sociolects of African-American English, which typically are distinctively different from Standard American English.

==Original usage==
The word &quot;Ebonics&quot; was originally coined in 1973 by African American social psychologist Robert Williams in a discussion with linguist Ernie Smith (as well as other language scholars and researchers) that took place in a conference on &quot;Cognitive and Language Development of the Black Child&quot;, held in St. Louis, Missouri. His intention was to give a name to the language of African Americans that acknowledged the linguistic consequence of the slave trade and avoided the negative connotations of other terms like &quot;nonstandard Negro English&quot;:
We need to define what we speak. We need to give a clear definition to our language...We know that ebony means black and that phonics refers to speech sounds or the science of sounds. Thus, we are really talking about the science of black speech sounds or language.
In 1975, the term appeared in &quot;, &quot; a book edited and co-written by Williams:

A two-year-old term created by a group of black scholars, Ebonics may be defined as &quot;the linguistic and paralinguistic features which on a concentric continuum represent the communicative competence of the West African, Caribbean, and United States slave descendants of African origin. It includes the various idioms, patois, argots, idiolects, and social dialects of black people&quot; especially those who have adapted to colonial circumstances. Ebonics derives its form from ebony (black) and phonics (sound, the study of sound) and refers to the study of the language of black people in all its cultural uniqueness.

Other writers have since emphasized how the term represents a view of the language of Black people as African rather than European. The term was not obviously popular, even among those who agreed with the reason for coining it. Even within Williams&#x27; book, the term &quot;Black English&quot; is far more commonly used than the term &quot;Ebonics&quot;.

John Baugh has stated that the term &quot;Ebonics&quot; is used in four ways by its Afrocentric proponents. It may:
:1. Be &quot;an international construct, including the linguistic consequences of the African slave trade&quot;;
:2. Refer to the languages of the African diaspora as a whole;
or it may refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of 
:3. It &quot;is the equivalent of black English and is considered to be a dialect of English&quot; (and thus merely an alternative term for African American English), or
:4. It &quot;is the antonym of black English and is considered to be a language other than English&quot; (and thus a rejection of the notion of &quot;African American &quot;English&quot;&quot; but nevertheless a term for what others refer to by this term, viewed as an independent language and not a mere ethnolect).

==Common usage and controversy==
&quot;Ebonics&quot; remained a little-known term until 1996. It does not appear in the 1989 second edition of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary,&quot; nor was it adopted by linguists. The term became widely known in the United States due to a controversy over a decision by the Oakland School Board to denote and recognize the primary language (or sociolect or ethnolect) of African-American youths attending school, and to thereby acquire budgeted funds to facilitate the teaching of standard English. Thereafter, the term &quot;Ebonics&quot; became popularized, though as little more than a synonym for African American English, perhaps differing in the emphasis on its claimed African roots and independence from English. The term is linked with the nationally discussed controversy over the decision by the Oakland School Board, which adopted a resolution to teach children &quot;standard American English&quot; through a specific program of respect for students&#x27; home language and tutoring in the &quot;code switching&quot; required to use both standard English and Ebonics.

In 1997, a special subcommittee discussed whether federal funding for ebonics language programs would be allowed.

While the term is generally avoided by most linguists, it is used elsewhere (such as on Internet message boards), often for ridiculing AAE, particularly when this is parodied as drastically differing from Standard American English. African American linguist John McWhorter argues that the use of the term does more to hinder than to help black academic achievement because considering AAE to be a completely different language from English serves only to widen the perceived divide between whites and blacks in the United States. Walt Wolfram, a long-time researcher into AAE, points out that discussion of this variety of English &quot;gets politicized and trivialized by the very term &quot;Ebonics&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="140257" wikidata="Q264029" url="?curid=140257" title="Emperor (band)">
<text>Emperor is a Norwegian black metal band formed in 1991 by guitarist and vocalist Ihsahn and guitarist Samoth. The group split up in 2001, but reunited from 2005 to 2007 for a few festival dates and brief US tours, and again reunited in 2013 to 2014. Emperor reformed for the third time in 2016. 

Emperor is regarded as highly influential by music critics and by emerging black metal bands.

==History==
In their youth, Ihsahn and Samoth met at a rock music seminar. The two young men began playing together under various names; first Dark Device, then Xerasia, then Embryonic. The group soon evolved into the now well-known band Thou Shalt Suffer. Soon, however, Samoth began to write music outside of Thou Shalt Suffer, and together with Ihsahn and a new bass player called Mortiis (later of his own eponymous band Mortiis), Emperor was formed. After a short while together, the band released a demo entitled &quot;Wrath of the Tyrant&quot;. It quickly gained popularity in the underground and attracted the attention of the then-start-up label Candlelight. Soon afterwards, a record contract was signed, Samoth moved to rhythm guitar, Ihsahn continued the vocal duties and lead guitars, and Faust was recruited as a drummer. Emperor released their debut EP, Emperor, under Candlelight Records. The band then was signed to the infamous first black metal label, Deathlike Silence Productions, and planned to release their next album soon, though the band never managed to release any material while signed to DSP.

In the summer of 1992, a series of events were set in motion by the black metal inner circle. Samoth, along with various other black metallers, set out to burn down old churches in Norway. Also in 1992, Faust lived in Lillehammer, and in the newly constructed Olympic park a man named Magne Andreassen approached him and suggested that they take a walk in the nearby forest. Faust agreed, and, once in the forest, Faust claimed the man began to make strong sexual advances towards him. Faust then stabbed the man to death, kicking him in the head afterward to ensure that he was dead. He was not convicted until two years later. The day after Faust committed the murder, he went with Euronymous of Mayhem and Varg Vikernes of Burzum to burn the Holmenkollen Chapel in Oslo. In the summer of 1993, the band began working on their first full-length album. Emperor ceased wearing corpse paint; they stated that it was becoming a trend and losing its original significance and symbolism. In autumn of that year, the police began to investigate the murder of Euronymous of Mayhem, naming Varg Vikernes as a suspect; this investigation eventually led to the incarceration of Samoth for arson, and of Faust for the murder of Magne Andreassen.

In 1994, Samoth was sentenced to 16 months in prison for burning the Skjold Church in Vindafjord, together with Varg Vikernes. The arson was committed during a pause in the recording of the Burzum EP &quot;Aske&quot; (‘Ashes’). In 1994, &quot;In the Nightside Eclipse&quot; was released, and earned Emperor widespread acclaim and a large fanbase.

After Samoth&#x27;s parole, the band was joined by Trym and Alver on drums and bass respectively, and at the end of 1996, Emperor entered the studio to record &quot;Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk&quot;. &quot;Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk&quot; won the &#x27;album of the year&#x27; poll in many metal magazines around the world, including UK &quot;Terrorizer&quot; and US &quot;Metal Maniacs&quot;. Bassist Alver soon left.

Aside from their European shows, the band played in Mexico City on 24 July 1999.

Now continuing their career as a trio, with Ihsahn handling keyboards, vocals, guitars and bass, the band recorded their third album &quot;IX Equilibrium&quot; and toured Europe and North America. It was around 2000 when Samoth and Trym started to gravitate more towards death metal, while Ihsahn directed his musical exploration towards his side project, Peccatum. Thus, in 2001, Emperor decided to disband after releasing one final album, &quot;&quot;, composed entirely by Ihsahn. Ihsahn later recalled that &quot;When we announced the split up in 2001, we didn&#x27;t think we would do anything more with Emperor ever again...The decision was also based on the feeling that Emperor had a lot of integrity, and that if we were going to end it, we should end it while we still created great music. For us, the decision was made in the black metal spirit. Since Samoth and I pulled in different directions, we didn&#x27;t see any point in continuing. The core of the band wasn&#x27;t intact anymore&quot;. Samoth echoed Ihsahn&#x27;s position: &quot;At that point, we both had other priorities that we wanted to pursue and we both felt that splitting up Emperor was the best thing to do. We really wanted to focus on other things, and felt it was the only right thing to do&quot;.

===Hiatus and occasional live performances===
Following the breakup, Samoth and Trym continued playing in the black/death metal outfit Zyklon, while Ihsahn concentrated on his family project Peccatum. Later Ihsahn announced a solo project, much in the vein of &quot;&quot; and Peccatum, featuring drummer Asgeir Mickelson of Borknagar and Vintersorg. It has generated positive feedback in the black metal community.

The band played a surprise three-song show in Oslo on 30 September 2005, at which they announced a series of full concerts to take place in California, New York City, and Europe in 2006. As of February 2006, they were also scheduled to play at the Inferno festival in April and Germany&#x27;s Wacken Open Air in August. Samoth was unable to take part in the US tour dates, as his conviction for the arson he committed in 1992 lengthened the process for his visa application, so Emperor performed without him.

On 7 October 2006, Emperor performed at the under-18 Motstøy-festival in their home town of Notodden. The band had wanted to do an under-18 gig and a gig at their home town, so the festival fit perfectly. It was held at a small venue called StuA, and with only 450 tickets available, the concert quickly sold out.

On 28 October 2006, Emperor returned to the UK to play a gig at London&#x27;s Astoria venue, where the band was warmly greeted by fans. In 2007, Emperor played a series of one-off shows in the United States and two festival gigs in France and Finland.

A tablature book based on their &quot;Scattered Ashes: A Decade of Emperial Wrath&quot; compilation album, containing thirteen Emperor tracks from their back catalogue, transcribed by Ihsahn with a foreword also by him, was released 31 October 2007 via Candlelight Records. Emperor&#x27;s albums were also re-issued in a special box version with a bonus poster on 21 August 2007.

Samoth announced on 23 October 2007 that Emperor had begun preparing a second official DVD release. On 8 December 2008 it was revealed that this release will be called &quot;Live Inferno&quot; and come in the form of a double-disc live album and a live DVD, taken from their appearances at Inferno and Wacken metal festivals during their brief reunion. It was released on 16 April 2009 in Europe and 21 April in North America.

On 2 August 2013, it was announced that Emperor would be reuniting to headline the 25th anniversary Wacken Festival in 2014. In the following months, they were announced as headliners for the 2014 editions of the Bloodstock Open Air and Hellfest festivals. In April 2014, they announced shows in Tokyo and Osaka for July with Trym playing drums due to Faust&#x27;s visa issues.
On 12 August 2016, it was announced that Emperor would reunite again in 2017 for a special set of performances to celebrate their 20th anniversary second studio album &quot;Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk&quot;.

On 27 December 2018, the band announced its presentation at the Mexico Metal Fest in Monterrey, Mexico in 2019.

Despite playing a handful of reunion shows, Ihsahn has stated that Emperor has no plans to record a new album. He was quoted as saying: &quot;It&#x27;s kind of a lose-lose thing. The whole point of black metal, people want something that is real and has integrity of what it is. At this point, none of us can see any reason to do that beyond what we already do.&quot;

==Controversy==
In 1995, Ihsahn promoted arson in an interview: &quot;Skjold Church was a large wooden church about 100 years old. The church contained an altar board and preaching chair from the 16th century. All this was said to be of historical, Christian value. So it was to be reduced to a pile of ashes. The material damages are set to be of 13 million Norwegian Kroners. The church was still being used by a large flock of blind followers. It became a victim for true Norwegian spirit on the 13th of September Anno 1992 during a stormy night. Witnessed by the moon, this symbolic act of anti-Christian war enlightened the night with pagan flames. Heathen barbarism is on the rise. We will bring back the forgotten past of strength, pride, and victory.&quot;

In 2014, Emperor attracted further controversy when the original drummer, Faust, joined them for live performances. Faust is a convicted murderer and caused some upset by being part of the shows.

<text>Henry Hay Jr. (April 7, 1912 – October 24, 2002) was an American gay rights activist, communist, and labor advocate. He cofounded the Mattachine Society, the first sustained gay rights group in the United States, as well as the Radical Faeries, a loosely affiliated gay spiritual movement. Hay has been described as &quot;the Founder of the Modern Gay Movement&quot; and &quot;the father of gay liberation&quot;.

Acknowledging both his same-sex sexual attraction and an interest in Marxism from an early age, Hay eventually worked as a professional actor in Los Angeles, where he joined the Communist Party USA, becoming a committed labor activist. He ended his 1938 marriage to a Party activist after recognizing he remained homosexual, establishing the Mattachine Society in 1950. 

Hay increasingly stood against the assimilationism and subversive infiltration tactics advocated by the majority of gay rights campaigners. Organizing to subvert the social and political marginalization of gay people, he cofounded the Los Angeles chapter of the Gay Liberation Front in 1969. After moving to New Mexico in 1970 with his longtime partner John Burnside, Native American religions influenced the couple to cofound the Radical Faeries in 1979 with Don Kilhefner and Mitchell L. Walker. 

After returning to Los Angeles, Hay remained involved in an array of activist causes throughout his life, and became a well-known, albeit controversial, elder statesman within the country&#x27;s gay community. In his later years, Hay was an active supporter of the pedophile advocacy organization North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA), speaking on panels and sessions at several of the group&#x27;s annual meetings. Hay protested the group being expelled from Pride parades, including his boycott of the 1994 New York Pride March.

== Early life ==
===Youth: 1912 to 1929===
Hay was born in the coastal town of Worthing in Sussex, south-east England (at 1 Bath Road, then known as &quot;Colwell&quot;), on April 7, 1912. Raised in an upper middle class American family, he was named after his father, Harry Hay, Sr. (1869-1938), a mining engineer who had been working for Cecil Rhodes first in Witwatersrand, South Africa, and then in Tarkwa, Ghana. His mother, Margaret Hay (née Neall), a Catholic, had been raised in a wealthy family among American expatriates in Johannesburg, South Africa, prior to her marriage in April 1911. Hay Sr. was raised a Presbyterian but converted to her religion on their marriage, and their children were brought up Catholic. Harry Hay Jr.&#x27;s aunt took him to an Episcopal church and later he would join First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles.

Their second child, Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Caroline Hay, was born in February 1914, but following the outbreak of the First World War, the family moved to Northern Chile, where Hay Sr. had been offered a job managing a copper mine in Chuquicamata by the Guggenheim family&#x27;s Anaconda Company.

In Chile, Hay Jr. contracted bronchial pneumonia, resulting in permanent scar tissue damage to his lungs. In May 1916, his brother John &quot;Jack&quot; William was born. In June 1916, Hay Sr. was involved in an industrial accident, resulting in the amputation of a leg. As a result, he resigned from his position and the family relocated to California in the United States. In February 1919, they moved to 149 Kingsley Drive in Los Angeles, with Hay Sr. purchasing a 30-acre citrus farm in Covina, also investing heavily in the stock market. Despite his wealth, Hay Sr. did not spoil his son, and made him work on the farm. Hay had a strained relationship with his father, whom he labelled &quot;tyrannical&quot;. Hay Sr. would beat his son for perceived transgressions, with Hay later suspecting that his father disliked him for having effeminate traits. He was particularly influenced on one occasion when he noted that his father had made a factual error: &quot;If my father could be wrong, then the teacher could be wrong. And if the teacher could be wrong, then the priest could be wrong. And if the priest could be wrong, then maybe even God could be wrong.&quot;
Hay was enrolled at Cahuenga Elementary School, where he excelled at his studies but was bullied. He began experimenting with his sexuality, and aged nine took part in sexual activity with a twelve-year-old neighbour boy. At the same time he developed an early love of the natural world and became a keen outdoorsman through walks in the wilderness around the city. Aged ten he was enrolled at Virgil Junior High School, and soon after joined a boys&#x27; club known as the Western Rangers, through which he developed an interest in Native American Cultures, specifically the Hopi and the Sioux. Becoming a voracious reader, in 1923 he began to volunteer at a public library, where he discovered a copy of Edward Carpenter&#x27;s book &quot;The Intermediate Sex&quot;. Reading it, he discovered the word &quot;homosexual&quot; for the first time and came to recognize that he was gay. Aged twelve he enrolled at Los Angeles High School, where he continued to be studious and developed a love of theater. Coming to reject Catholicism, he remained at the school for three mandatory years before deciding to remain for a further two. In this period, he took part in the school&#x27;s poetry group, became State President of the California Scholarship Federation and President of the school&#x27;s debating and dramatic society, and competed in the Southern California Oratorical Society&#x27;s Contest, as well as joining the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps.

During the summer holidays, Hay&#x27;s father sent him to work on his cousin&#x27;s cattle ranch in Smith Valley, Nevada. Here he was introduced to Marxism by fellow ranch hands who were members of the Industrial Workers of the World (&quot;Wobblies&quot;). They gave him books and pamphlets written by Karl Marx, leading to his adoption of socialism. He learned of men having sex with other men through stories passed around by ranch hands, telling him of violent assaults on miners who attempted to touch men with whom they shared quarters. Hay often told a tall tale that, in 1925, he was invited to a local gathering of Natives, where he claimed to have met Wovoka, the Paiute religious leader who revived the Ghost Dance movement, and that Wovoka had recognized him in some way. However, Wovoka, as a well-known spiritual leader, led a well-documented life, and Hay&#x27;s story does not line up with his activities and whereabouts during the time in question. However, Hay&#x27;s family did have an actual, documented, blood connection to Wovoka and the Ghost Dance movement. In 1890, a misinterpretation of the Ghost Dance ritual as a war dance by Indian agents led to the Wounded Knee Massacre. Hay&#x27;s great-uncle, Francis Hardie, carried the Third Cavalry flag at Wounded Knee.

In 1926, at the end of the summer, Hay took his union card to a hiring hall in San Francisco, convinced the union officials he was 21, and got a job on a cargo ship to work his way back to Los Angeles. After an unloading at Monterey Bay, the 14-year-old Hay met and had sex with a 25-year-old merchant-sailor named Matt, who introduced him to the idea of gay men as a global &quot;secret brotherhood&quot;. Hay would later build on this idea, in combination with a Stalinist definition of nationalist identity, to argue that homosexuals constituted a &quot;cultural minority&quot;.

===Stanford University and the Communist Party: 1929 to 1938===
Graduating from school in 1929, Hay hoped to study paleontology, but was forbidden from doing so by his father, who insisted that he pursue law. Hay Sr. obtained an entry-level job for his son at his friend&#x27;s legal firm, Haas and Dunnigan. While working at the firm, Hay discovered the gay cruising scene in Pershing Square, where he developed a sexual relationship with a man who taught him about the underground gay culture. It has been claimed that here he learned about the Chicago-based gay rights group the Society for Human Rights, although Hay would later deny having any knowledge of previous LGBT activism.

In 1930, Hay enrolled at Stanford University to study international relations, taking independent study courses in English, history, and political science. There, he became increasingly interested in acting and also wrote poetry, some of which was published in university magazines. He came to frequent the gay scene in both Los Angeles and San Francisco, attending parties where men danced with men, women danced with women, people cross-dressed, and alcohol was consumed, all of which was illegal. He had a number of sexual and romantic trysts with various men; one biographer asserts that these included a one-night stand with Prince George, Duke of Kent, and a brief affair with James Broughton. In 1931, he came out as gay to some people he knew at Stanford, and while he did not face any vehement backlash, some friends and associates, including a number who were gay, chose not to be seen with him from then on. A severe sinus infection led Hay to drop out in 1932, and he returned to his cousin&#x27;s Nevada ranch to recuperate; he would never return to university.

Relocating to Los Angeles, Hay moved back in with his parents. He associated with artistic and theatrical circles, befriending composer John Cage and his lover Don Sample, with the former getting Hay to perform vocals at one of his concerts in November 1932. Becoming a professional voice actor, he obtained a minor role in a radio adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; performed by George K. Arthur&#x27;s International Group Players for the Hollywood Playhouse. They were impressed with his talent, and gave him a job as a permanent understudy. He supplemented this income as a screen extra, usually as a stunt rider in B movies, and also worked as a freelance dialogue coach for expat aristocrats in Hollywood. Through a friendship with George Oppenheimer he was able to get work screen-writing as a ghost-writer. Immersing himself in the Hollywood gay scene, he claimed to have had brief flings with Willy Wakewell, Philip Ahn, Hans Heinrich von Twardowski, and Richard Cromwell. Having met the Thelemite high priestess Regina Kahl on a play that they were both working on, he agreed to play the organ for the public performances of the Gnostic Mass given by Agape Lodge, the Hollywood branch of Ordo Templi Orientis.

While working on a play, Hay met actor Will Geer, with whom he entered into a relationship. Geer was a committed leftist, with Hay later describing him as his political mentor. Geer introduced Hay to Los Angeles&#x27; leftist community, and together they took part in activism, joining demonstrations for laborers&#x27; rights and the unemployed, and on one occasion handcuffed themselves to lamposts outside UCLA to hand out leaflets for the American League Against War and Fascism. Other groups whose activities he joined in with included End Poverty in California, Hollywood Anti-Nazi League, the Mobilization for Democracy, and Workers Alliance of America. Hay and Geer spent a weekend in San Francisco during the city&#x27;s 1934 General Strike, where they witnessed police open fire on protesters, killing two; this event further committed Hay to societal change. Hay joined an agitprop theatre group that entertained at strikes and demonstrations; their performance of &quot;Waiting for Lefty&quot; in 1935 led to attacks from the fascist Friends of New Germany group.

After Hay had become increasingly politicized, Geer introduced him to the Communist Party USA (CPUSA); however, from the beginning, Hay was perturbed at the Party&#x27;s hostility to homosexuals and its view that same-sex attraction was a deviance resulting from bourgeois society. Although he joined the Party in 1934, his involvement was largely restricted to attending fundraisers until 1936. In late 1937, Hay attended further classes in Marxist theory at which he came to fully understand and embrace the ideology, becoming a fully committed member of the Party. From the time he joined the Party until leaving it in the early 1950s, Hay taught courses in subjects ranging from Marxist theory to folk music at the &quot;People&#x27;s Educational Center&quot; in Hollywood and later throughout the Los Angeles area. Hay, along with Roger Barlow and LeRoy Robbins, directed the 1937 short film &quot;Even As You and I&quot;, featuring Hay, Barlow, and filmmaker Hy Hirsh, in which they spoofed surrealism. In early 1937, Hay Sr. was partly paralysed following a stroke, leaving Hay to take on many of his family duties.

===Marriage and Marxist class: 1938 to 1948===

Hay began Jungian analysis in 1937. He later claimed that the psychiatrist &quot;misled&quot; him into believing that through marriage to a woman, he could become heterosexual; the psychiatrist suggested that Hay find himself a &quot;boyish girl&quot;. After confiding with fellow Party members that he was homosexual, they too urged Hay to marry a woman, adhering to the party line that same-sex attraction was a symptom of bourgeoise decadence. Acting on this advice, in 1938 he married Anna Platky (1914-1983), a Marxist Party member from a working-class Jewish family. Hay maintained that he loved her, and was happy to have a companion with whom he could share his political pursuits; he also got along well with her family. Their marriage took place in September 1938, in a non-religious wedding ceremony overseen by a Unitarian minister. Their honeymoon however was cut short as a result of the sudden death of Hay, Sr. Settling into married life, Hay gained employment with the Works Progress Administration supervising the cataloguing of Orange County&#x27;s civil records, while the couple continued their activism by taking photographs of Los Angeles&#x27; slums for a leftist exhibition. However, the marriage did not quell Hay&#x27;s same-sex attractions, and by 1939 he had begun to seek sexual encounters with other men in local parks on a weekly basis. He would later describe the marriage as &quot;living in an exile world&quot;.

The couple moved to Manhattan, New York City, where Hay went through a series of unsteady and low-paid jobs, including as a scriptwriter, a service manager in Macy&#x27;s toy department, and a marketing strategy planner. Briefly returning to acting, he appeared in George Sklor&#x27;s off-Broadway play &quot;Zero Hour&quot;. The couple involved themselves with the city&#x27;s Communist Party branch, with Hay becoming a party functionary in the Theater Arts Committee for Peace and Democracy, and in 1941 he was appointed interim head of the New Theatre League, responsible for organising trade union theatre groups and teaching acting classes, for which he adopted the Konstantin Stanislavski &#x27;system&#x27;. By 1940 he was having a series of affairs with men in the city, developing a seven-month relationship with architect William Alexander, almost leaving his wife for him. During this period he took part in the research of sexologist Alfred Kinsey.

In 1942, the couple returned to Los Angeles, renting a house near to Silver Lake and Echo Park; the area was colloquially known as &quot;the Red Hills&quot; due to its large left-wing community. There, Hay went through various jobs, including with Russian War Relief, as a puddler, and as a production engineer at a manufacturing plant. He was not conscripted into the armed forces following the outbreak of World War II due to his work with Avion Aircraft, which was deemed essential for the country&#x27;s war effort. He would subsequently work in a record store, a television repair shop, and at a boiler manufacturing plant. Better-paid work was barred from him by his political viewpoints, with the Federal Bureau of Investigation monitoring his activities. He spent much time teaching lessons in Marxism across the Los Angeles Bay Area, for which he read widely in anthropology and sociology, but faced problems due to the increased anti-communist repression being exerted by the government through the Smith Act and the subsequent creation of the House Un-American Activities Committee. From 1945, he was involved in the People&#x27;s Songs organisation, becoming the group&#x27;s theoretician, through which he came to know Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger. From 1947, he taught a musicology class on the &quot;Historical Development of Folk Music&quot;, through which he articulated a Marxist understanding of the genre; he continued to teach these classes through the mid-1950s.

In September 1943, Hay and his wife adopted a daughter, Hannah Margaret, soon moving to a larger home nearby to accommodate her. They adopted a second daughter, Kate Neall, several days after her birth in December 1945. Hay was a caring parent, and encouraged his children&#x27;s interests in music and dance. In 1945, Hay was diagnosed with hypoglycemia, and the following year began to suffer intense mental anxiety and repeated nightmares as he realised that he was still homosexual and that his marriage had been a serious mistake. The couple divorced in 1951.

==Gay rights activism==

===Mattachine Society: 1948 to 1953===
Influenced by the publication of the Kinsey Reports, Hay conceived the idea of a homosexual activist group in August 1948 which later became the Mattachine Society. After signing a petition for Progressive Party presidential candidate Henry A. Wallace, Hay spoke with other gay men at a party about forming a gay support organization for the campaign called &quot;Bachelors for Wallace&quot;. Encouraged by the response he received, Hay wrote out the organizing principles that night, a document he referred to as &quot;The Call&quot;, however the men who had expressed an interest were not enthused the following morning. Over the next two years, Hay refined his idea, finally conceiving of an &quot;international ... fraternal order&quot; to serve as &quot;a service and welfare organization devoted to the protection and improvement of Society&#x27;s Androgynous Minority&quot;, the latter being a term that he later rejected. He planned to call this organization &quot;Bachelors Anonymous&quot; and envisioned it serving a similar function and purpose as Alcoholics Anonymous. At the centre of its approach was Hay&#x27;s view that homosexuals were &quot;a social minority&quot; or &quot;cultural minority&quot; who were being oppressed; in this he was influenced by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Marxist–Leninist concepts of what constituted a minority group.

Hay met Rudi Gernreich in July 1950, with the pair soon entering a relationship. Gernreich shared many of Hay&#x27;s leftist ideas, and was impressed by The Call. He became an enthusiastic financial supporter of the venture, although not lending his name, going instead by the initial &quot;R&quot;. Hay, Gernreich, and their friends Dale Jennings, Bob Hull, and Chuck Rowland met on November 11, 1950, in Los Angeles, under the name &quot;Society of Fools&quot;. The group changed its name to &quot;Mattachine Society&quot; in April 1951, chosen by Hay at the suggestion of fellow member James Gruber, based on Medieval French secret societies of masked men who (through their anonymity) were empowered to criticize ruling monarchs with impunity.

In April 1951, Hay informed his wife about his continuing homosexuality and his work with the Mattachine Society; she was angry and upset. In September they gained a divorce on the grounds of Hay&#x27;s &quot;extreme cruelty&quot; and he moved out of their home. He continued to send half his paycheck to Anita for twelve years, meanwhile cutting out most of his friends from that social milieu. He informed the Communist Party of the news, recommending that he be expelled; the Party forbade homosexuals from being members. Although they agreed and discharged him as a &quot;security risk&quot;, they also declared him a &quot;Lifelong Friend of the People&quot; in recognition of his many years of service. Hay&#x27;s relationship with Gernreich ended not long after, with Hay entering a relationship with Danish hat-maker Jorn Kamgren in 1952; it would last for eleven years, during which Hay helped him establish a hat shop, attempting to use his contacts within the fashion and entertainment industries to get exposure for Kamgren&#x27;s work and meeting with moderate success.

Mattachine&#x27;s structure was based partly on that of the Communist Party and partly on fraternal brotherhoods like Freemasonry. Operating on the Leninist basis of democratic centralism, it had cells, oaths of secrecy and five different levels of membership, each of which required greater levels of involvement and commitment. As the organization grew, the levels were expected to subdivide into new cells, creating the potential for both horizontal and vertical growth. The founding members constituted the &quot;Fifth Order&quot; and from the outset remained anonymous. Mattachine&#x27;s membership grew slowly at first but received a major boost in February 1952 when founder Jennings was arrested in a Los Angeles park and charged with lewd behavior. Often, men in Jennings&#x27; situation would plead guilty to the charge and hope to quietly rebuild their lives. Jennings and the rest of the Fifth Order saw the charges as a means to address the issue of police entrapment of homosexual men. The group began publicizing the case under the name Citizens Committee to Outlaw Entrapment, and the generated publicity brought financial support and volunteers. Jennings admitted during his trial to being a homosexual but insisted he was not guilty of the specific charge. The jury deadlocked (eleven to one in favor of acquittal), with the judge dismissing the charges; Mattachine declared victory.

Following the Jennings trial, the group expanded rapidly, with founders estimating membership in California by May 1953 at over 2,000 with as many as 100 people joining a typical discussion group. This brought greater scrutiny of the group, and in February 1953 a Los Angeles daily newspaper published an article exposing Hay as a Marxist; not wishing to tar the Society as a Communist group, Hay stepped down from his position. The group&#x27;s membership was diversifying, with people from a broader political spectrum becoming involved. Many members were concerned by the far left control of the group and felt that it should have a more open, democratic structure. At a group convention held in Spring 1953, Hal Call and other conservative members challenged the leaders to amend its constitution and to affirm that members were loyal to the United States and its laws. In an effort to preserve their vision of the organization, the Fifth Order members revealed their identities and resigned their leadership positions. With the founders gone, Call and other like-minded individuals stepped into the leadership void, and Mattachine officially adopted non-confrontation as an organizational policy. The reduced effectiveness of this newly organized Mattachine led to a precipitous drop in membership and participation. Hay was distraught at Mattachine&#x27;s change in direction, having an emotional breakdown as a result.

===After Mattachine: 1953 to 1969===

Hay&#x27;s relationship with Kamgren was strained, and he was bored by a life of domesticity and annoyed with Kamgren&#x27;s controlling and regimented nature. They had little in common, with Kamgren not sharing Hay&#x27;s interest in political activism, instead being conservative and, in Hay&#x27;s words, &quot;petty bourgeois&quot;. Kamgren permitted Hay to spend three nights a week in study, which the latter spent reading anthropological and historical texts to learn more about the role of gay people in society, becoming particularly interested in the &quot;berdache&quot; of Native American communities. In doing so, Hay was annoyed that Marxist scholars like V. Gordon Childe and George Derwent Thomson evaded the subject in their works. Although his writing style was widely deemed difficult to read, he published articles on many of his findings in the gay press, namely &quot;ONE Institute Quarterly&quot; and &quot;ONE Confidential&quot;, also giving lectures on the subject at ONE&#x27;s Mid-Winter Institute. Meanwhile, in May 1955 Hay was called to testify before a subcommittee of the House Un-American Activities Committee that was investigating Communist Party activity in Southern California. The subcommittee was aware that Hay was a Marxist, and as such he struggled to find legal representation, fearing that he would lose his job and worrying that his sexuality would be used to smear the Party.

Feeling that he was being restrained by the relationship, Hay left Kamgren, in 1963 beginning a brief relationship with Jim Kepner. Together they mooted the idea of starting a new Mattachine Society; this came to nothing. Influenced by the growing counter-culture, Hay ceased to wear suits, instead favouring brightly colored clothing, earrings and necklaces, also growing his hair long. In doing so, he stated that &quot;I never again wanted to be mistaken for a hetero.&quot; At a subsequent ONE event, Hay met the inventor John Burnside, who became his life partner. Burnside left his wife for Hay, with the latter becoming the manager for Burnside&#x27;s kaleidoscope factory. As the pair became increasingly interested in the counter-culture, many individuals belonging to the movement came to work for them. Moving to downtown Los Angeles, together the pair created a gay brotherhood called the Circle of Loving Friends in 1965, although they would frequently be the only members of it. As the Circle they participated in early homophile demonstrations throughout the 1960s and helped establish the North American Conference of Homophile Organizations (NACHO) in 1966.

Fascinated by spirituality, they regularly attended events of the Council on Religion and the Homosexual, and despite his anti-military stance, Hay became Chairman of the Los Angeles Committee to Fight Exclusion of Homosexuals from the Armed Forces, taking part in the group&#x27;s motorcade protest through the city. Attempting to gain greater visibility for the gay rights cause, he made appearances on local media, such as &quot;The Joe Pyne Show&quot;. Hay and Burnside also took part in research and fundraising for the Committee for Traditional Indian Land and Life, attending the first North American Traditional Indian conference at Tonawanda, New York state, in 1967. In June 1969, the Stonewall riots in New York City marked a move toward a more radical and militant approach among gay rights activists; Hay however stated that &quot;I wasn&#x27;t impressed by Stonewall, because of all the open gay projects we had done throughout the sixties in Los Angeles. As far as we were concerned, Stonewall meant that the East Coast was catching up.&quot; The riot led to the emergence of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF), with Hay and Burnside involving themselves in the early development of its Los Angeles chapter in December 1969. Hay was elected its first chairperson, organising pickets of homophobic establishments, holding a one-day &quot;Gay-In&quot; in Griffith Park and &quot;funky dances&quot; at Troupers Hall to challenge the legal restrictions on same-sex dancing.

==Later life==
===New Mexico and the Radical Faeries: 1971 to 1979===

In May 1971, Hay and Burnside moved to the San Juan Pueblo in New Mexico, taking their kaleidoscope factory with them. However, in June 1973, an accidental fire destroyed their kaleidoscope factory and mail order inventory, leaving them without a livelihood. In New Mexico, Hay once again took part in activism; he volunteered for a radical newspaper, &quot;El Grito&quot; (&quot;The Cry&quot;), which aimed at a Chicano readership. In 1975, he took a leading role in a water rights campaign to prevent the federal government from damming the Rio Grande. Local activists argued that it would devastate local farmland while benefitting the wealthy land owner Richard Cook, whose own land would be made fertile by the dam and who owned the company that was due to construct it. Hay organised the publication of literature on the subject, forming an umbrella activist group, and building it into a national campaign through the Nation-Wide Friends of the Rio Grande. The campaign was ultimately successful as the government rejected the plans in 1976. During the campaign, his mother died, and he was unable to return to Los Angeles for her memorial service.

After this, he involved himself in the foundation of a local LGBT rights group, the Lambdas de Santa Fe, designed to fight homophobic violence in northern New Mexico. The group sponsored a gay ball, and in June 1977 they held Albuquerque&#x27;s first Gay Pride Parade. Hay&#x27;s fame had begun to grow across the U.S., and at this time he was contacted by the historians Jonathan Ned Katz and John D&#x27;Emilio over the course of their independent research projects into the nation&#x27;s LGBT history. He and Burnside also appeared in Peter Adair&#x27;s documentary film, &quot;Word Is Out&quot; (1977).
In 1978, Hay teamed up with Don Kilhefner and Mitchell L. Walker to co-host a workshop on &quot;New Breakthroughs in the Nature of How We Perceive Gay Consciousness&quot; at the annual conference of the Gay Academic Union, held at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. This event convinced Hay and his partner John Burnside that they should leave their home in New Mexico and move to Los Angeles, where they settled into a 1920s house on the eastern edge of Hollywood. The three then decided to organise an outdoor conference at which they could teach other gay men about their ideas regarding gay consciousness. Kilhefner identified an ideal location from an advert in &quot;The Advocate&quot;; the Sri Ram Ashram was a gay-friendly spiritual retreat in the desert near Benson, Arizona, owned by an American named Swami Bill. Hay, Kilhefner, and Walker visited to check its suitability, and although Hay disliked Bill and didn&#x27;t want to use the site, the others insisted.

Their conference, set for Labor Day 1979, was to be called the &quot;Spiritual Conference for Radical Fairies&quot;, with the term &quot;Radical Faerie&quot; having been coined by Hay. The term &quot;Radical&quot; was chosen to reflect both political extremity and the idea of &quot;root&quot; or &quot;essence&quot;, while the term &quot;Faerie&quot; was chosen in reference both to the immortal animistic spirits of European folklore and to the fact that &quot;fairy&quot; had become a pejorative slang term for gay men. Initially, Hay rejected the term &quot;movement&quot; when discussing the Radical Faeries, considering it to instead be a &quot;way of life&quot; for gay males, and he began referring to it as a &quot;not-movement&quot;. In organizing the event, Hay handled the political issues, Burnside the logistics and mechanics, Kilhefner the budgetary and administrative side, and Walker was to be its spiritual leader. A flier advertising the event was released which proclaimed that gays had a place in the &quot;paradigm shift&quot; of the New Age, and quoted Mark Satin and Aleister Crowley alongside Hay; these fliers were sent out to gay and leftist bookstores as well as gay community centres and health food stores.

Around 220 men turned up to the event, despite the fact that the Ashram could only accommodate around 75. Hay gave a welcoming speech in which he outlined his ideas regarding Subject-SUBJECT consciousness, calling on those assembled to &quot;throw off the ugly green frogskin of hetero-imitation to find the shining Faerie prince beneath&quot;. Rather than being referred to as &quot;workshops&quot;, the events that took place were known as &quot;Faerie circles&quot;, and were on such varied subjects as massage, nutrition, local botany, healing energy, the politics of gay enspiritment, English country dancing, and auto-fellatio. Those assembled took part in spontaneous rituals, providing invocations to spirits and performing blessings and chants, with most participants discarding the majority of their clothes, instead wearing feathers, beads, and bells, and decorating themselves in rainbow makeup. Many reported feeling a change of consciousness during the event, which one person there described as &quot;a four day acid trip – without the acid!&quot;. On the final night of the gathering, they put together a performance of the Symmetricon, an invention of Burnside&#x27;s, while Hay gave a farewell speech.

After Hay and the others returned to Los Angeles, they received messages of thanks from various participants, many of whom asked when the next Faerie gathering would be. Hay decided to found a Faerie circle in Los Angeles that met at their house, which became known as &quot;Faerie Central&quot;, devoting half their time to serious discussion and the other half to recreation, in particular English circle dancing. As more joined the circle, they began meeting in West Hollywood&#x27;s First Presbyterian Church and then the olive grove atop the hill at Barnsdall Park; however they found it difficult to gain the same change of consciousness that had been present at the rural gathering. The group began to discuss what the Faerie movement was developing into; Hay encouraged them to embark on political activism, using Marxism and his Subject-SUBJECT consciousness theory as a framework for bringing about societal change. Others however wanted the movement to focus on spirituality and exploring the psyche, lambasting politics as part of &quot;the straight world&quot;. Another issue of contention was over what constituted a &quot;Faerie&quot;; Hay had an idealized image of what someone with &quot;gay consciousness&quot; thought and acted like, and turned away some prospective members of the Circle because he disagreed with their views. One prospective member, the gay theater director John Callaghan, joined the circle in February 1980, but was soon ejected by Hay after he voiced concern about hostility toward heterosexuals among the group.

The second Faerie gathering took place in August 1980 in Estes Park near Boulder, Colorado. Twice as long and almost twice as large as the first, it became known as Faerie Woodstock. It also exhibited an increasing influence from the U.S. pagan movement, as Faeries incorporated elements from Evans&#x27; &quot;Witchcraft and the Gay Counterculture&quot; and Starhawk&#x27;s &quot;The Spiral Dance&quot; into their practices. At that gathering, Dennis Melba&#x27;son presented a shawl that he had created with a crocheted depiction of the Northwest European Iron Age deity Cernunnos on it; the shawl became an important symbol of the Faeries, and would be sent from gathering to gathering over subsequent decades. There, Hay publicly revealed the founding trio&#x27;s desire for the creation of a permanent residential Faery community, where they could grow their own crops and thus live self-sustainably. This project would involve setting up a non-profit corporation to purchase property under a community land trust with tax-exempt status. They were partly inspired by a pre-existing gay collective in rural Tennessee, Short Mountain.

In 1980, Walker secretly formed the &quot;Faerie Fascist Police&quot; to combat &quot;Faerie fascism&quot; and &quot;power-tripping&quot; within the Faeries. He specifically targeted Hay: &quot;I recruited people to spy on Harry and see when he was manipulating people, so we could undo his undermining of the scene.&quot;

At a winter 1980 gathering in southern Oregon designed to discuss acquiring land for a Faerie sanctuary, a newcomer to the group, coached by Walker, confronted Harry about the power dynamics within the core circle. In the ensuing conflict, the core circle splintered. Plans for the land sanctuary stalled and a separate circle formed. The core circle made an attempt to reconcile, but at a meeting that came to be known as &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;, Kilhefner quit, accusing Hay and Burnside of &quot;power tripping&quot;, while Walker resigned. Walker and Kilhefner formed a new Los Angeles-based gay spiritual group called Treeroots which promoted a form of rural gay consciousness associated with Jungian psychology and ceremonial magic. However, despite the division among its founders, the Radical Faerie movement continued to grow, largely as a result of its egalitarian structure, with many participants being unaware of the squabbles. Hay himself continued to be welcomed at gatherings, coming to be seen as an in the movement.

===Later years: 1980 to 2002===
During the 1980s, Hay involved himself in an array of activist causes, campaigning against South African apartheid, Nicaragua&#x27;s Contras, and the death penalty, while also joining the nuclear disarmament and pro-choice movements, becoming a vocal critic of the administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Hoping for a left-ward turn in U.S. politics, he was involved in the Lavender Caucus of Jesse Jackson&#x27;s National Rainbow Coalition. Although pleased with the popular protests in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe that took place in the late 1980s and early 1990s, he was unhappy that those nations abandoned the socialist cause altogether and retained his faith in Marxism.

Hay came to be viewed as an elder statesman within the gay community, and was regularly invited to give speeches to LGBT activist and student groups. He was the featured speaker at the San Francisco Gay Pride Parade in 1982, and Grand Marshal of the Long Beach Gay Pride Parade in 1986. In 1989, West Hollywood city council awarded him an honor for his years of activism while that year he was invited to give a lecture at the Sorbonne in Paris, France, which he turned down.

He nevertheless remained highly critical of the mainstream gay rights movement, and took controversial and, at times, divisive positions, including his consistent support of the North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) being included in Pride parades. When speaking at the 1983 Gay Academic Union forum at New York University, his speech included, &quot;If the parents and friends of gays are truly friends of gays, they would know from their gay kids that the relationship with an older man is precisely what thirteen-, fourteen-, and fifteen-year-old kids need more than anything else in the world&quot;, as well as highlighting his own relationship with an adult man when he was fourteen, saying &quot;I send to all of you my love and deep affection for what you offer to the boys, in honor of this boy when he was fourteen, and when he needed to know best of all what only another gay man could show him and tell him&quot;. He continued to speak on panels at NAMBLA events in 1984 and 1986, and at the 1986 
Los Angeles Gay Pride Parade he wore two signs; on his front one that read &quot;Valerie Terrigno walks with me&quot;, referring to the politician who agreed to withdraw from the event lest being barred, and on his back &quot;NAMBLA Walks With Me&quot;, after organizers banned the pedophile advocacy group from joining the march. The organizers complained to police and he narrowly avoided arrest. In &quot;Before Stonewall&quot;, biographer Vern L. Bullough writes, &quot;Getting him to agree to simply wear a sign [supporting NAMBLA] rather than carry a banner took considerable negotiation by the parade organizers, who wanted to distance the gay and lesbian movement from pedophilia, yet wanted Harry to participate.&quot;

Hay continued to protest NAMBLA being banned from Pride parades, in 1994 protesting the Stonewall 25 events exclusion of NAMBLA on the grounds that such exclusions &quot;pandered to heterosexual-dominated society&quot;. Despite the efforts of the vast majority of the LGBT community to distance themselves from pedophiles and pedophilia, Hay and a handful of others who were boycotting Stonewall 25, including NAMBLA, organized an alternative, competing event.
He was also critical of the HIV/AIDS activist group ACT UP, arguing that their confrontational tactics were rooted in the typical machismo of straight men and thus reflected an assimilationist approach. Hay believed that by adopting these tactics and attitudes, ACT UP was shrinking the space available for diversity of gender roles for gay men, with the gentle and the effeminate discarded in their favor. He went so far as to condemn the group while at a June 1989 rally in New York&#x27;s Central Park where he shared the stage with Allen Ginsberg and Joan Nestle. In 1994, Hay refused to participate in the official parade in New York City commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall riots because it also refused NAMBLA a place in the event. Instead, he joined an alternate parade called &quot;The Spirit of Stonewall&quot;. As late as 2000, Hay continued to speak out against assimilation saying, &quot;The assimilationist movement is running us into the ground.&quot;

Hay and Burnside returned to San Francisco in 1999 after concluding that Hay was not receiving proper care in Los Angeles for his serious health concerns, including pneumonia and lung cancer. He served as the Grand Marshal of the San Francisco gay pride parade that same year. While in hospice care, Hay died of lung cancer on October 24, 2002, at age 90. His ashes, mingled with those of his partner John Burnside, were scattered in Nomenus Faerie Sanctuary, Wolf Creek, Oregon.

==Theory==
As he had throughout his life of activism, Hay continued to oppose what he perceived as harmful assimilationist attitudes within the gay community. &quot;We pulled ugly green frog skin of heterosexual conformity over us, and that&#x27;s how we got through school with a full set of teeth,&quot; Hay once explained. &quot;We know how to live through their eyes. We can always play their games, but are we denying ourselves by doing this? If you&#x27;re going to carry the skin of conformity over you, you are going to suppress the beautiful prince or princess within you.&quot; Having rooted his political philosophy from the founding of Mattachine in the belief that homosexuals constituted a cultural minority, Hay was wary of discarding the unique attributes of that minority in favor of adopting the cultural traits of the majority for the purpose of societal acceptance. Having witnessed the move of Mattachine away from its founding Marxist activist principles and having seen the gay community marginalize drag queens and the leather subculture through the first decade of the post-Stonewall gay movement, Hay opposed what he believed were efforts to move other groups to the margins as the gay rights movement progressed.

==Legacy==
In 1990, Stuart Timmons published &quot;The Trouble with Harry Hay&quot;, a biography based on three years of research. Timmons described Hay as &quot;the father of gay liberation&quot;. The 2002 documentary film &quot;Hope Along the Wind: The Life of Harry Hay&quot;, directed by Eric Slade, garnered critical acclaim.

In 1967, Hay and Burnside had appeared as a couple on Joe Pyne&#x27;s syndicated television show. Hay also appeared in other documentaries, including &quot;Word Is Out&quot; (1978), also appearing with his partner Burnside.

Hay, along with Gernreich, is one of the main characters of the play &quot;The Temperamentals&quot; by Jon Marans with Thomas Jay Ryan playing Hay and Michael Urie as Gernreich; after workshop performances in 2009 the play opened off-Broadway in 2010.

On June 1, 2011, the Silver Lake, Los Angeles Neighborhood Council voted unanimously to rename the Cove Avenue Stairway in Silver Lake to the Mattachine Steps in honor of Hay.

In 2014, Hay was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco&#x27;s Castro neighborhood noting LGBTQ people who have &quot;made significant contributions in their fields.&quot;

Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots in June 2019, Hay was one of the inaugural fifty American &quot;pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes&quot; named to the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor, located within the Stonewall National Monument, the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history.

<doc id="140264" wikidata="Q776391" url="?curid=140264" title="Type A Kō-hyōteki-class submarine">
<text>The class was a class of Japanese midget submarines (&quot;Kō-hyōteki&quot;) used during World War II. They had hull numbers but no names. For simplicity, they are most often referred to by the hull number of the mother submarine. Thus, the midget carried by &quot;I-16&quot;-class submarine was known as I-16&#x27;s boat, or &quot;I-16tou.&quot;

This class was followed by: , , and , the last one better known as .

==History==

Fifty were built. The &quot;A Target&quot; name was assigned as a ruse: if their design were prematurely discovered by Japan&#x27;s foes, the Japanese Navy could insist that the vessels were battle practice targets. They were also called or and other nicknames.

The first two, &quot;No.1&quot; and &quot;No.2&quot;, were used only in testing. They did not have conning towers, which were added to the later boats for stability under water.

&quot;No.19&quot; was launched by at Pearl Harbor. Most of the other fifty are unaccounted for, although three were captured in Sydney (Australia), and others in Guam, Guadalcanal, and Kiska Island, accounting for some of the other hull numbers.

The submarines were each armed with two 450 mm (17.7 in.) torpedoes in muzzle-loading tubes one above the other at the bow. In the Pearl Harbor attack, the specially designed Type 97 torpedo was used, with a warhead and a range of at , but problems with the oxygen flasks which held the air for propulsion meant that all later attacks used a different torpedo. Some have stated that a version of the Type 91 torpedo, designed for aircraft launching, was used, but other reports indicate that the Type 97 torpedo was modified to the Type 98, otherwise known as the Type 97 special. There is no definitive information that the Type 91 was used. The Type 98 was later supplanted by the Type 02 torpedo.

After the war 300 midget submarines of various types were found in various stockpiles in Japan. The submarines were fitted with 1300Ib warheads to be used in suicide attacks, they were intended to ram enemy ships in the event of a mainland invasion but were believed to have never been used.

Each submarine had a crew of two men. A junior officer conned the boat while a petty officer manipulated valves and moved ballast to control trim and diving.

==Pearl Harbor attack==


Five of these boats participated in the Pearl Harbor attack, with possibly two actually making it into the harbor. Secret war records show that submarine crews had been ordered to scuttle their subs after the attack and provisions were made to recover stranded crews. Of the five used at Pearl Harbor, &quot;No.19&quot; was captured with its pilot Kazuo Sakamaki where it grounded on the east side of Oʻahu. During World War II, &quot;No.19&quot; was put on tour across the United States to help sell War Bonds. Now a U.S. National Historic Landmark, &quot;No.19&quot; is an exhibit at the National Museum of the Pacific War in Fredericksburg, Texas.

A second Pearl Harbor midget submarine, &quot;No.18&quot;, was located by U.S. Navy divers and US Marine Divers in training including Laurence McInnis and Fred Stock of A Company, 3rd Recon Battalion, off Keʻehi Lagoon east of the Pearl Harbor entrance on 13 June 1960. The submarine had been damaged by a depth charge attack and abandoned by its crew before it could fire its torpedoes. It is unknown what happened to its 2 crew as their bodies were never found. This submarine was restored and placed on display at the Naval Academy Etajima 15 March 1962.

The midget submarine attacked by at 6:37 a.m. on 7 December, &quot;No.20&quot;, was located in 400 meters (1,312 feet) of water five miles outside Pearl Harbor by a University of Hawaiʻi research submersible on 28 August 2002. It was visited at approximately 6:30 am local time, by an Okeanos explorer ROV, on 7 December 2016, 75 years after it was sunk.

A fourth submarine, &quot;No.22&quot;, entered the harbor and fired its torpedoes at and . Both of those torpedoes missed and are believed to have hit a dock at Pearl City and the shore of Ford Island. This submarine was sunk by &quot;Monaghan&quot; at 8:43 a.m. on 7 December and later recovered and used as fill during construction of a new landside pier at the Pearl Harbor submarine base. The hulk was uncovered again in 1952 but was so badly corroded by chlorine gas from the electrical batteries that it was again reburied at the same location. The crew&#x27;s remains are still entombed in the submarine.

Japanese forces received a radio message believed to be from the fifth submarine, &quot;No. 16&quot; at 00:41 on 8 December claiming damage to one or more large warships inside Pearl Harbor. At 22:41 on 7 December, they received a message from &quot;No. 16&quot; describing the air attack on Pearl Harbor as successful, and at 00:51 on 8 December they received another message that read &quot;Unable to navigate.&quot; They never heard from &quot;No. 16&quot; again. In 1992, 2000, and 2001, Hawaiʻi Undersea Research Laboratory&#x27;s submersibles found the wreck of a midget sub lying in three parts three miles south of the Pearl Harbor entrance. The wreck was in the debris field where much surplus U.S. equipment was dumped from the West Loch Disaster of 1944, including vehicles and landing craft. In 2009, a research team assembled by the PBS television series &quot;Nova&quot; positively identified the sub as being the last, &quot;No.16&quot;, of the 5 Ko-Hyoteki that participated in the 7 December 1941, attack, plioted by Ensign Masaji Yokoyama and Petty Officer 2nd Class Sadamu Kamita. Both of its torpedoes were missing, indicating that the midget sub may have fired its torpedoes prior to its sinking. Although this correlates with reports of two torpedoes fired at the light cruiser at 10:04 at the entrance of Pearl Harbor, and a possible torpedo fired at destroyer at 08:21, there is dispute over this official chain of events; the &quot;torpedo&quot; that &quot;St. Louis&quot; saw was also reportedly a porpoising minesweeping float being towed by the destroyer . Some have suggested that circumstantial evidence supports a hypothesis that &quot;No.16&quot; successfully entered Pearl, fired its torpedoes at Battleship Row, and fled to the relative quiet of neighboring West Loch, and possibly was scuttled by its crew. When a series of explosions sank an amphibious fleet being assembled in the Loch in 1944, it is suggested the remains of the sub were collected and dumped in the subsequent salvage operation, which was kept classified as secret until 1960. A photograph taken from a Japanese plane during the Pearl Harbor attack shows what might have been &quot;No.16&quot; inside the harbor firing its torpedoes at Battleship Row. The photo was declassified in the 1990s and publicized in the 2000s to the public. The sinking of the USS &quot;West Virginia&quot; and capsizing of the may have been accelerated by a torpedo hit from a submarine-launched torpedo, the warheads of which were larger than the aerial torpedoes. Some believe that in the photo, where the torpedoes&#x27; paths had supposedly started, were sprays that indicated a midget-submarine rocking up and down due to the force of the torpedo being launched, causing the propellers of the stern to be exposed, kicking up clouds of water spray. A war time report from Admiral Nimitz confirmed the recovery of at least one dud torpedo of the type employed by the midget submarines. The theory is covered in the &quot;Nova&quot; episode &quot;Killer Subs in Pearl Harbor&quot; and companion website, I-16tou.com.

== Attacks on Sydney ==


On the night of 29 May 1942, five large Japanese submarines positioned themselves 56 kilometres north-east of Sydney Heads. At 3 a.m. the next day one of the submarines launched a reconnaissance aircraft. After circling Sydney Harbour the aircraft returned to its submarine, reporting the presence of &#x27;battleships and cruisers&#x27; moored in the harbour. The flotilla&#x27;s commanding officer decided to attack the harbour with midget submarines the next night. The next day the five submarines approached to within 11 kilometres of Sydney Heads, and at about 4:30 p.m. they released three midget submarines, which then began their approach to Sydney Harbour.

The outer-harbour defences detected the entry of the first midget submarine, &quot;No.14&quot;, at about 8 pm, but it was not identified until it became entangled in an anti-torpedo net that was suspended between George&#x27;s Head and Green Point. Before HMAS &quot;Yarroma&quot; was able to open fire, the submarine&#x27;s two crew members destroyed their vessel with demolition charges and killed themselves.

The second submarine, &quot;No.24b&quot;, entered the harbour at about 9.48 p.m. and headed west towards the Sydney Harbour Bridge, causing a general alarm to be issued by the Naval Officer in Charge, Sydney. About 200 metres from Garden Island the submarine was fired on by the heavy cruiser . The submarine then fired its two torpedoes at the cruiser. One torpedo ran ashore on Garden Island, but failed to explode. The other passed under the Dutch submarine &quot;K9&quot; and struck the harbour bed beneath the depot ship HMAS &quot;Kuttabul&quot; where it exploded, killing 21 sailors (19 Royal Australian Navy and 2 Royal Navy). The submarine then slipped out of the harbour, its mission complete, and disappeared. Its wreck was located, about 30 km north of the harbour and 5 km to seaward, in November 2006. It is now protected as a war grave.

The third submarine, &quot;No.21&quot;, was sighted by HMAS &quot;Yandra&quot; at the entrance to the harbour and was depth-charged. Some four hours later, having recovered, it entered the harbour, but it was subsequently attacked with depth charges and sunk in Taylor Bay by vessels of the Royal Australian Navy. Both members of the submarine&#x27;s crew committed suicide.

The two submarines that were recovered were identical, and their remains were used to reconstruct a complete submarine, which toured New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia before being delivered to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra in 1943, where it remains on display.

== Attacks on Madagascar ==
On 29 May 1942, the Japanese submarines &quot;I-10&quot;, &quot;I-16&quot; and &quot;I-20&quot; arrived at Madagascar. &quot;I-10&quot;″s reconnaissance plane spotted &quot;Revenge&quot;-class battleship at anchor in Diego Suarez harbor but the plane was spotted and &quot;Ramillies&quot; changed her berth. &quot;I-20&quot; and &quot;I-16&quot; launched two midget submarines, one of which managed to enter the harbor and fired two torpedoes while under depth charge attack from two corvettes. One torpedo seriously damaged &quot;Ramillies&quot;, while the second sank the 6,993 ton oil tanker &quot;British Loyalty&quot; (later refloated). &quot;Ramillies&quot; was later repaired in Durban and Plymouth.

The crew of one of the submarines, Lieutenant Saburo Akieda and Petty Officer Masami Takemoto, beached their submarine (&quot;No.20b&quot;) at Nosy Antalikely and moved inland towards their pick-up point near Cape Amber. They were informed upon when they bought food at a village and both were killed in a firefight with Royal Marines three days later. The second midget submarine, &quot;No.16b&quot;, was lost at sea and the body of one of its crew was found washed ashore a day later.

==Characteristics==

==Survivors==

There are the remains of one in the open at Kiska in the Aleutian Islands, and some in the waters nearby.

There are four reasonably intact Type A midgets on display in the world:
* HA-8 – Submarine Force Library and Museum, Groton, Connecticut
* HA-18 – JMSDF Etajima Naval Base, Etajima, Japan
* HA-19 – National Museum of the Pacific War, Fredericksburg, Texas
* A composite of two that entered the Sydney harbor in May 1942 – Australian War Memorial, Canberra, Australia

A third such submarine used in the attack at Sydney has been found, but remains in the waters off Sydney, to be left in situ as a war grave.

<doc id="140270" wikidata="Q48767245" url="?curid=140270" title="African-American English">
<text>African-American English (AAE) is the umbrella term for English dialects spoken predominantly by Black people in the United States and many in Canada; most commonly, it refers to a dialect continuum ranging from African-American Vernacular English to more standard American English. Like all widely spoken language varieties, African-American English shows variation stylistically, generationally, geographically (that is, features specific to singular cities or regions only), in rural versus urban characteristics, in vernacular versus standard registers, etc. There has been a significant body of African-American literature and oral tradition for centuries.

==Name==
The broad topic of the English language, in its diverse forms, as used by Black people in North America has various names, including Black American English or simply Black English. Also common is the somewhat controversial term Ebonics and, more recently in academic linguistics, African American Language (AAL).

==History==
African-American English began as early as the 17th century, when the Atlantic slave trade brought enslaved West Africans into Southern colonies (which eventually became the Southern United States in the late 18th century). During the development of plantation culture in this region, nonstandard dialects of English were widely spoken by British settlers, which probably resulted in both first- and second-language English varieties being developed by African Americans. The 19th century&#x27;s evolving cotton-plantation industry, and eventually the 20th century&#x27;s Great Migration, certainly contributed greatly to the spread of the first of these varieties as stable dialects of English among African Americans.

The most widespread modern dialect is known as African-American Vernacular English. Despite more than a century of scholarship, the historical relationship between AAVE and the vernacular speech of whites in the United States is still not very well understood; in part, this is because of a lack of data from comparable groups, but also because of the tendency to compare AAVE to northern vernaculars or even standard varieties of English while conflating regional and ethnic differences, as well as disregarding the sociohistorical context of AAVE origins. AAVE shares several linguistic features with Southern White Vernacular English (and even more with older Southern dialects), many of which either emerged or became widespread during the last quarter of the 19th century. The farm tenancy system that replaced slavery in the American South drew in Southern Whites, leading to a context for an interracial speech relationship dynamic among socioeconomic equals throughout the South and leading to many shared features until the start of WWII; leading to the situation wherein changes that became robust after the 1930s most strongly mark ethnic distinctions in speech.

==Dialects==
===African-American Vernacular English===

African-American Vernacular (AAVE) is the native variety of the majority of working-class and many middle-class African Americans, particularly in urban areas, with its own unique accent, grammar, and vocabulary features. Typical features of the grammar include a &quot;zero&quot; copula (e.g., &quot;she my sister&quot; instead of &quot;she&#x27;s my sister&quot;), omission of the genitive clitic (e.g., &quot;my momma friend&quot; instead of &quot;my mom&#x27;s friend&quot;), and complexity of verb aspects and tenses beyond that of other English dialects (e.g., constructions like &quot;I&#x27;m a-run&quot;, &quot;I be running&quot;, &quot;I been runnin&quot;, &quot;I done ran&quot;). Common features of the phonology include non-rhoticity (dropping the &quot;r&quot; sound at the end of syllables), the metathetic use of &quot;aks&quot; instead of &quot;ask&quot;, simplification of diphthongs (e.g., &quot;eye&quot; typically sounds like &quot;ah&quot;), a raising chain shift of the front vowels, and a wider range of intonation or &quot;melody&quot; patterns than most General American accents. AAVE is often used by middle-class African Americans in casual, intimate, and informal settings as one end of a sociocultural language continuum, and AAVE shows some slight variations by region or city.

===African-American Standard English===
African-American Standard English, a term largely popularized by linguist Arthur Spears, is the prestigious and native end of the middle-class African-American English continuum that is used for more formal, careful, or public settings than AAVE. This variety exhibits standard English vocabulary and grammar but often retains certain elements of the unique AAVE accent, with intonational or rhythmic features maintained more than phonological ones. Frequently, middle-class African Americans are between this standard variety and AAVE, tending toward using the former variety in school and other public places, so that adults will frequently even codeswitch between the two varieties within a single conversation. The phonological features maintained in this standard dialect tend to be less marked. For instance, one such characteristic is the omission of the final consonant in word-final consonant clusters, so words such as &quot;past&quot; or &quot;hand&quot; may lose their final consonant sound.

===African-American Appalachian English===
Black Appalachian Americans have been reported as increasingly adopting Appalachian/Southern dialect commonly associated with White Appalachians. These similarities include an accent that is rhotic, the categorical use of the grammatical construction &quot;he works&quot; or &quot;she goes&quot; (rather than the AAVE &quot;he work&quot; and &quot;she go&quot;), and Appalachian vocabulary (such as &quot;airish&quot; for &quot;windy&quot;). However, even African-American English in Appalachia is diverse, with African-American women linguistically divided along sociocultural lines.

Despite its distinctiveness, AAAE shares many features with other varieties of Appalachian English, including the use of nonstandard pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. AAAE also shares features with other varieties of African American English, particularly those spoken in the South. For instance, a study of African American communities in the Appalachian region of Virginia found that the dialects of these communities shared many features with both African American English and Southern White English.

===African-American Outer Banks English===
African-American English in the North Carolina Outer Banks is rapidly accommodating to urban AAVE through the recent generations, despite having aligned with local Outer Banks English for centuries.

The dialect has been studied by linguists and has been documented in various works, such as the book African American Outer Banks English: A Sociolinguistic Study by Elizabeth C. Zsiga (2000). This book provides a detailed description of the language, including its grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. It also provides a history of the dialect and examines how it has changed over time.

===African Nova Scotian English===
African Nova Scotian English is spoken by descendants of Black Nova Scotians, black immigrants from the United States who live in Nova Scotia, Canada. Though most African-American freedom seekers in Canada ended up in Ontario through the Underground Railroad, only the dialect of African Nova Scotians retains the influence of West African pidgin. In the 19th century, African Nova Scotian English would have been indistinguishable from English spoken in Jamaica or Suriname. However, it has been increasingly de-creolized since this time, due to interaction and influence from the white Nova Scotian population. Desegregation of the province&#x27;s school boards in 1964 further accelerated the process of de-creolization. The language is a relative of the African-American Vernacular English, with significant variations unique to the group&#x27;s history in the area. There are noted differences in the dialects of those from Guysborough County (Black Loyalists), and those from North Preston (Black Refugees), the Guysborough group having been in the province three generations earlier.

 use data from early recordings of African Nova Scotian English, Samaná English, as well as the recordings of former slaves to demonstrate that speech patterns were inherited from nonstandard colonial English. The dialect was extensively studied in 1992 by Shana Poplack and Sali Tagliamonte from the University of Ottawa.

The grammar of ANS is largely based on standard English, but there are several distinct features that set it apart from other varieties of English. These features include the use of the negative concord—which is the use of multiple negative words in a sentence to emphasize the negative—and the double negative, which is the use of two negative words in a sentence to express a positive meaning. In addition, ANS also has its own pronunciation rules, such as the use of the letter “d” instead of “th” and the dropping of the “g” in words ending in “ing”.

A commonality between African Nova Scotian English and African-American Vernacular English is (r)-deletion. This rate of deletion is 57% among Black Nova Scotians, and 60% among African Americans in Philadelphia. Meanwhile, in the surrounding mostly white communities of Nova Scotia, (r)-deletion does not occur.

===Older African-American English===
Older or earlier African-American English refers to a set of many heterogeneous varieties studied and reconstructed by linguists as theoretically spoken by the first African Americans and enslaved Africans in British America and, later, the United States. Of primary interest is the direct theoretical predecessor to AAVE. Mainly four types of sources have been used for the historical reconstruction of older AAVE: written interviews, ex-slave audio recordings, the modern diaspora dialects of isolated black communities, and letters written by 18th- and 19th-century African Americans. The use of the zero copula (the absence of &quot;is&quot; or &quot;are&quot;, as in &quot;she gon&#x27; leave&quot;), nonstandard plural forms (&quot;the three man&quot;, &quot;mans&quot;, or even &quot;mens&quot;) and multiple negatives (as in &quot;no one didn&#x27;t leave me nothing&quot;) were occasional or common variants in these earlier dialects, and the latter item even the preferred variant in certain grammatical contexts. Other nonstandard grammatical constructions associated with AAVE are documented in older dialects too; however, many of them are not, evidently being recent innovations of 20th-century urban AAVE.

===Gullah===
Sea Island Creole English, or &quot;Gullah&quot;, is the distinct language of some African Americans along the South Carolina and Georgia coast. Gullah is an English creole: a natural language grammatically independent from English that uses mostly English vocabulary. Most Gullah speakers today are probably bidialectal. A sub-dialect of Gullah is also spoken in Oklahoma and Texas, known as Afro-Seminole Creole.

The language is derived from a mixture of African languages and English, with words and phrases from Caribbean and West African languages such as Akan, Wolof, and Fula. Gullah has been described as a “linguistic bridge between Africa and the New World” (“Gullah Culture”). The Gullah culture is deeply rooted in African traditions, particularly in the practice of storytelling and the use of handicrafts. Gullahs have a strong connection to the land, and their traditional fishing, farming, and basket-weaving practices reflect this. In recent years, efforts have been made to preserve Gullah culture and language. The Gullah Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor Commission was established in 2006 to help protect and promote the Gullah culture. The commission has partnered with universities, museums, and other organizations to develop programs and initiatives to preserve Gullah language and traditions.

==In literature==
There is a long tradition of representing the distinctive speech of African Americans in American literature. A number of researchers have looked into the ways that American authors have depicted the speech of black characters, investigating how black identity is established and how it connects to other characters. argues that early mass media portrayals of black speech are the strongest historical evidence of a separate variety of English for black people. Early popular works are also used to determine the similarities that historical varieties of black speech have in common with modern AAVE.

The earliest depictions of black speech came from works written in the 18th century, primarily by white authors. A notable exception is &quot;Clotel&quot; (1853), the first novel written by an African American (William Wells Brown). Depictions have largely been restricted to dialogue and the first novel written entirely in AAVE was June Jordan&#x27;s &quot;His Own Where&quot; (1971), though Alice Walker&#x27;s epistolary novel &quot;The Color Purple&quot; (1982) is a much more widely known work written entirely in AAVE. Lorraine Hansberry&#x27;s 1959 play &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot; also has near exclusive use of AAVE. The poetry of Langston Hughes (1901–1967) uses AAVE extensively.

Some other notable works that have incorporated representations of black speech (with varying degrees of perceived authenticity) include:
* Edgar Allan Poe: &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot; (1843)
* Herman Melville: &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; (1851)
* Harriet Beecher Stowe: &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (1851–1852)
* Joel Chandler Harris: Uncle Remus stories (1880)
* Mark Twain: &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; (1885)
* Thomas Nelson Page: &quot;In Ole Virginia&quot; (1887)
* Thomas Dixon: &quot;The Clansman&quot; (1905)
* William Faulkner: &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; (1929)
* Margaret Mitchell: &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1936)
* Zora Neale Hurston: &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; (1937)
* William Faulkner: &quot;Go Down, Moses&quot; (1942)
* John Kennedy Toole: &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; (1980)
* Sapphire: &quot;Push&quot; (1996)

As there is no established spelling system for AAVE, depicting it in literature is instead often done through spelling changes to indicate its phonological features, or to contribute to the impression that AAVE is being used (eye dialect). More recently, authors have begun focusing on grammatical cues, and even the use of certain rhetorical strategies.

==In television and film==
Portrayals of black characters in film and television are also done with varying degrees of authenticity. In &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; (1934), the speech and behavioral patterns of Delilah (an African American character) are reminiscent of minstrel performances that set out to exaggerate stereotypes, rather than depict black speech authentically. More authentic performances, such as those in the following films and TV shows, occur when certain speech events, vocabulary, and syntactic features are used to indicate AAVE usage, often with particular emphasis on young, urban African Americans:

African American English has been used in television and film since the early days of Hollywood. For example, in the 1940s, the popular radio show Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy featured African American characters who spoke in African American English. This show was popular and influential, and it established AAE as a part of popular culture. In the decades since, AAE has continued to be used in television and film as a way to depict African American characters. It is often used to provide comedic relief or to illustrate the unique characteristics of African American culture. For example, the 1990s television show Martin featured a main character who speaks in AAE and is often the source of comedic moments. 
* Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy (1940)
* &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; (1989)
* &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; (1990–1996)
* &quot;Jungle Fever&quot; (1991)
* &quot;Laurel Avenue&quot; (1993)
* &quot;Fresh&quot; (1994)

==In education==
Nonstandard African-American varieties of English have been stereotypically associated with a lower level of education and low social status. Since the 1960s, however, linguists have demonstrated that each of these varieties, and namely African-American Vernacular English, is a &quot;legitimate, rule-governed, and fully developed dialect&quot;. The techniques used to improve the proficiency of African-American students learning standard written English have sometimes been similar to that of teaching a second language. Contrastive analysis is used for teaching topics in African-American Vernacular English. Both the phonological and syntactic features of a student&#x27;s speech can be analyzed and recorded in order to identify points for contrast with Standard American English. Another way AAE can be taught is based on a strategy, communicative flexibility, that focuses on language used at home and analyzes speech during dramatic play. Using this method, children are taught to recognize when SAE is being used and in which occasions, rather than conforming to the speech around them in order to sound correct.

Although the stigmatization of AAE has continued, AAE remains because it has functioned as a social identity marker for many African-Americans. The goal with teaching SAE is not to end its use, but to help students differentiate between settings where its use is and is not considered acceptable. In addition, research has also found that AAE can be used as a bridge to mainstream academic English. By understanding the similarities and differences between AAE and mainstream American English, teachers can provide students with effective strategies for learning and using both dialects.

Recently, linguists like John McWhorter have tried to persuade the public that &quot;Black English&quot; is not a separate language from or imperfect form of &quot;Standard English&quot;. He argues that Black English is a separate dialect, distinct from Standard English in the same way that Canadian French and Swiss French are distinct from the standard dialect of Parisian French. He also acknowledges that we have a long way to go as a society in recognizing Black English as anything but &quot;full of slang and bad grammar&quot;.

==In music==

African-American English, particularly AAVE, is often used by rappers in hip-hop music. AAE also has a long tradition as the main dialect of spirituals, blues, jazz, R&amp;B, and other music movements and styles originating with African Americans.
