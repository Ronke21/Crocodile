<text>Irasburg is a town in Orleans County, Vermont, United States. Irasburg was established in 1781 when the land was granted to Ira Allen, Roger Enos, Jerusha Enos (wife of Roger Enos), Jerusha Enos, Jr. (wife of Ira Allen), Roger Enos, Jr. and others by the Vermont General Assembly. Ira Allen later obtained the rights of the other proprietors, and he deeded the town to Jerusha Enos, Jr. as a wedding gift.

The 2020 United States Census reported that there were 1,233 citizens living in Irasburg. Irasburg has a total land area of , being land and being water. The unincorporated village of Irasburg is in the center of the town.

On average, it snows 9 out of the 12 months of the year.

==History==
The land now known as Irasburg was granted on February 23, 1781, to Ira Allen, by the General Assembly of Vermont. The lands of Vermont were then claimed by both New Hampshire and New York. The Continental Congress ordered that the land would not be distributed until the inhabitants of New York, New Hampshire, and the land known as &quot;Vermont&quot; had resolved the conflict of who truly owned the land. The General assembly of Vermont ignored this order, however, and Vermont was granted to 40–70 individuals. Ira Allen, the person known to have been granted the most land, was born in Colchester in 1790 and attended Middlebury College and the University of Vermont. The Allens leased the land that they had received to settlers. Although Ira Allen was the first to be granted land, Irasburg&#x27;s first settler was Caleb Leach in 1798. No land was conveyed by deed, however, until Ira H. Allen, son of Ira Allen, became town resident in 1814 and served as town clerk.

Captain James Richardson settled Irasburg in 1803 and is believed to have opened the first tavern in town.

The production of salts and pearl-ashes was the primary industry in Irasburg for the early 19th century. Although there was an embargo, those goods were transported to Canada. There was a large amount of smuggling of the salts and pearl-ashes by the town&#x27;s residents.

Mills emerged in Irasburg as early as 1810. By the 1820s, the town had begun to prosper as industrial sites began to emerge, which included a woolen mill, tannery, and factory production of stoves and plows.

The Old Heerman Mill was located here.

In 1812, the legislature voted to change the shire town of Orleans County to Irasburg. Supporting buildings were completed in 1816.

In 1812, Irasburg became an Orleans County shire town, as it remained until 1886. In 1886, the legislature moved the shire town to Newport.

The first courthouse and jail were built in 1815, by Irasburg residents at their own expense. The original courthouse was moved in 1847, however, and a new one was built on the same site. The original jail was built of timber and was replaced by one that was made of stone in 1838. It was eventually made of granite in 1862.
In 1862, Company E of the 9th Vermont Infantry was recruited, in part, from Irasburg.

In 1877, the town was still spelled &quot;Irasburgh.&quot;

The original county courthouse burned, with all of its records, in 1910 or 1911. A new Irasburg Town Hall was built in 1911 and remodeled in 1990.

The town was in the national news in 2010 when it appeared that a moose was going to be destroyed for theoretically carrying disease but mostly because &quot;tamed&quot; wildlife is not allowed in Vermont. The Vermont Legislature crafted a law that spared the moose&#x27;s life.

<text>Lowell is the westernmost town in Orleans County, Vermont, United States. The population was 887 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 56.1 square miles (145.2 km2), of which 56.0 square miles (145.1 km2) is land and 0.1 square mile (0.2 km2) (0.11%) is water. The unincorporated village of Lowell is in the center of the town.

===Geology===
Circa 400 million years ago, large and slow moving upheavals formed the serpentine rock and the asbestos fiber which sometimes accompanies serpentine. This serpentine comprises Brown&#x27;s Ledges at the Lowell-Westfield border. A rare fern species, &quot;Adiantum viridimontanum&quot;, grows which can tolerate the high nickel content of serpentine. Serpentine also contains iron, so much so that some rocks can be magnetized. This affects where cell towers can be placed in town. The iron oxide gives the color brown to &quot;Brown&#x27;s Ledges.&quot;

The major Baie Verte fault line runs through Lowell. The Burgess branch of the river follows the fault with serpentine rocks on one side and nonserpentine rocks on the other.

The Lowell (chrysotile) quarry on Belvidere Mountain was the last asbestos mine to operate in the Eastern U.S. It closed in 1993.

==History==

Lowell was chartered in 1787 by Governor Thomas Chittenden to John Kelley in 1787, for whom it was named Kellyvale. The first people other than the Native Americans to come to Lowell was in 1778 when the area was surveyed, preparatory to Col. John Hazen constructing a road to Canada for military purposes. This road was abandoned at what is now named Hazen’s Notch on Route 58.

The first settlers were Major Caldwell and family from Barre, Massachusetts in 1806. The town was formally organized in 1812, the same year the first school began with twelve students.

The presence of asbestos was first noted in 1824.

In 1831 the name was changed to Lowell; the origin remains uncertain.

The town grew from 144 people in 1820 with an average age of 17, to 413 in 1840 with an average age of 12.

By 1840 Churches had been built and Methodist, Congregational, Baptist and Roman Catholic services were being held.

During the first half of the nineteenth century, the population inflow was predominantly from other states of the US. In the second half the new arrivals were more often foreign-born - from Ireland and from French-speaking Canada. By 1870 the population was 944 and it reached its peak in 1890 when it stood at 1,178. Farming and lumber were its main economic base. Dairy products and hardwood were both exported to other states. Silsby and Company lumber mill closed in the 1920s. This loss of jobs resulted in a population drop of 40% between 1920 and 1940.

Several tons of asbestos were mined in 1870. By 1910, Lowell produced half the asbestos mined in the United States.

Lumber exports stopped by 1930. Farming has experienced a slow but steady decline since 1930 or so. Consistent with all of Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom, Lowell lost population throughout most of the twentieth century. This trend reversed in the mid-1980s.

The asbestos mine in Lowell was of economic importance from the 1940s to the mid-1980s. In the mid-1940s, the Belvidere mines produced more than 90% of all U.S. asbestos. In 1967, the mine produced of asbestos fiber [sic] annually. It closed in 1992.

The Shortsleve Mink Farm was located here.

In 2008, the town supported the Democratic candidate for president 225 to 151, yet voted for the local Republican challenger for the Vermont Legislature 229 to 79 to 71 (three parties).

In 2008, the state warned residents of the town and nearby towns that there was a &quot;health risk&quot; for people living within a radius of the asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain. Above ground mill tailings were estimated at . In April 2009, the Vermont Department of Health released a revised study which found that all deaths related to the asbestos mine were caused by occupational exposure. The report also concluded that people living near the mines had no increased risk of asbestos-related illness than people living anywhere else in Vermont. However, the site will still need to be cleaned up. In 2009, the expected cost of cleanup was $300 million.

In 2012 Kingdom Community Wind, built by Green Mountain Power in cooperation with Vermont Electric Cooperative, began operation. With a nameplate capacity of over 63 MW, the 21 turbines produce enough power to meet the annual needs of over 24,000 average Vermont residences, and is the largest wind farm in the state of Vermont.

<text>Orleans is a village in the northwestern corner of Barton, Orleans County, Vermont, United States. With a population of 788 at the 2020 census, it is the largest village in the county.

==History==

Roger Enos purchased land in 1820 in the area from Ira Allen. He had been given a land grant as a veteran in lieu of pay after the Revolutionary War; he may also have purchased this parcel from Herman Allen. It was named &quot;Barton Landing&quot;; this was the first place where craft could be safely loaded for transportation down the Barton River to Lake Memphremagog. It was at the confluence of the Willoughby and Barton rivers, providing sufficient water for flotation. Native Americans had used this landing for years before the pioneers.

Enos built the first building, a sawmill, at the confluence. Jesse Cook bought this building in 1830 to convert to a textile mill for weaving cloth, part of the northern economy using cotton from the South. In 1839 John Little converted it into a grain mill.

Lovinas Chandler bought this building in 1869 to use as a lumber mill. His son, who founded the E. L. Chandler Company, expanded the business here and in Barton Village in the 1890s. About the turn of the 20th century, Parker Young Company bought this complex of buildings. The 1928 flood ruined these buildings, together with causing other damage throughout the region.

Parker Young sold these properties back to E.L. Chandler. The owners developed the Sweat-Comings Company, the Vermont American Corporation, and finally, the Baumritter Corporation. The latter&#x27;s furniture division expanded from a payroll of $120,000 in 1954 to $2,500,000 in 1968. Then it was sold to Ethan Allen Manufacturing.

In 1833, the Valley House was built as a restaurant and tavern. In 1875 twenty rooms were added for an inn. The building was destroyed by fire in 1998.

The railroad reached the village in 1859–1860. Railroad accidents were not uncommon. On November 9, 1909, a crew member was killed in a head-on collision between two locomotives, just north of the rail intersection with Main Street. Near the same place, on March 12, 1913, another head-on collision killed one of the crew.

The railroad requested that the village change its name to avoid confusion with Barton Village. The village changed its name to Orleans in 1908 by popular vote, to the name of the county.

In the late 1910s, the Ku Klux Klan was first revived in Atlanta. It gradually expanded into northern and midwestern cities, where anxieties about migration, immigration, and social changes had heightened because of rapid industrialization and movement of peoples. The KKK promoted itself as a fraternal organization, among many that had been started since the late 19th century. In this period, it was primarily opposed to Catholic and Jewish immigrants, but kept some of its racist background. A chapter was started in Orleans. A 1918 photograph shows children at the old Opera House, a number of them dressed in KKK hoods, and others in blackface.

In the late 1970s, as efforts were made to improve water quality and the environment, the federal and state governments stopped the village from dumping raw sewage into the Barton River. Orleans built a new treatment plant, which cost $2.8 million, 90% of which was paid for by state and federal governments. The village disconnected its old storm sewers from the sanitary sewage system.

In 1999, the local Ethan Allen plant employed 600 workers. This dropped substantially in the 21st century, as it moved some manufacturing offshore or to areas with lower labor costs.

==Government==
Like all Vermont incorporated villages, the government is run directly by the people. Residents conduct the village meeting on the second Tuesday of March. They elect all officers, including those in the Fire Department.

Officers:
* Moderator (runs March village meeting. Elected each year) - Bill Davies

* Clerk - Shelia Martin
* Village Manager (appointed by Trustees) – John Morley III

===Water and sewage===
The village pumps water from the Willoughby River to its high reservoir during off-peak hours. The water is treated with chlorine, fluoride and polyphosphate. Sewage is treated by an anoxic-oxic system.

Billing and fees are quarterly. Households or apartment buildings pay a flat fee of $39 per quarter, plus $2 for of water beyond . There is a flat fee of $78.12 per dwelling per quarter for sewage.

===Education===
The village and surrounding area supports a graded school. The effective spending per pupil was $11,770 in 2008. The average in Vermont was $11,548.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 0.7 square mile (1.8 km2), all land.

The village is at the northwestern corner of the town of Barton. At the edge of the village, the Willoughby River Falls is a long stretch of river with cascades and a chute. In spring rainbow trout migrate up the river and falls from Lake Memphremagog in order to spawn.

==Demographics==

==Culture==
Orleans has a library which is open 28 hours a week over four days. It is a non-profit corporation. There is one part-time paid librarian. Other help is volunteer. The library is unique in the county for having an endowment left as an estate which also constructed the building.

==Education==
The elementary school was recognized as being among the ten &quot;most improved&quot; schools in the state in 2008. It also exceeded state averages in every category on the standardized NECAP test and was the only school in the area to do so.

==Transportation==

===Major routes===
The opening of the Interstate north on November 9, 1972, and opening south in 1978 affected the town comparable to the opening of the railway a century earlier.

* Interstate 91 – Barton village southbound, Derby northbound
* U.S. Route 5 – Barton village, southbound, to Coventry, northbound

==History==
Troy was chartered as &quot;Missisquoi.&quot; It once produced over of cast iron annually.

In the winter of 1799, a small party of American Indians, led by their chief, Captain Susap, joined the colonists at Troy, built their camps on the river and wintered near them. These Indians were nearly starving, which probably arose from the moose and deer, which formerly abounded here, being destroyed by the settlers. Their principal employment was making baskets, birch-bark cups and pails, and other Indian trinkets. They left in the spring and never returned. One of the party was a Native American woman, Molly Orcutt, who became quite noted among the settlers as a healer. She was found dead on Mount Whitecap, in East Andover, Maine, in 1817, having died, it is believed, at an age of 140 years.

Dr. Levi Moore and A.j. Rowell were Underground Railroad agents before the Civil War.

In one of the stranger chapters in Vermont history, researcher and scientist Gerald Bull constructed the Space Research Corporation in Highwater the town&#x27;s Quebec neighboring city, in 1967. His intent was to fire research packages into orbit using heavy artillery. This laboratory straddled the Vermont border. Bull was ultimately imprisoned for violating international regulations regarding an embargo on South Africa. This resulted in the bankruptcy of his corporation.

In 1998, a flood damaged the generator at Bakers Falls dam. The 600 kW generator produced an annual output of 1,500 MW.

In 2010, the Troy Elementary School had the highest percentage of students qualifying for free lunch in the county, 73%. The state average was 31%.

<text>Westmore is a town in Orleans County, Vermont, United States. The population was 357 at the 2020 census, making it the least populated and least densely populated town in the county. The town contains one unincorporated village clustered around Lake Willoughby.

==History==

Originally named Westford, the town was chartered on August 17, 1781. Since Chittenden County had a town named Westford, in 1787 the name was changed to Westmore.

The first vacation house was built on the lake in 1860. It is known as the Cheney House, named after an owner in the late 19th century.

Westmore never attracted many settlers. The town&#x27;s peak population was in the census year of 1880 with 485 people.

Before he became famous, Robert Frost camped here in the summer of 1909 with his family.

Songadeewin Camp for girls was located here from 1921–1975.

Electricity became available at the south end of the lake, from West Burke, .

In 1970, the state of Vermont acquired as part of Willoughby State Forest, which included the Cheney House.

Nudity is legal throughout Vermont, though in 2007–2008, the town discussed whether to ban nudity, aimed at sunbathers on the south beach of Lake Willoughby.

Having closely approximated the state&#x27;s voting percentages for governor, in 2006, and president in 2004, Westmore was considered one of six &quot;bellwether&quot; towns for the 2008 general election.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 37.5 square miles (97.0 km2), of which 34.5 square miles (89.4 km2) is land and 2.9 square miles (7.6 km2) (7.85%) is water.

One of the town&#x27;s most prominent features is Lake Willoughby. The relatively young 12,000-year-old glacier-carved lake is flanked on the east by Mount Pisgah and the west by Mount Hor . The mountains, which have hundreds of feet of rock cliffs, are located in the Willoughby State Forest and the cliffs have been designated a National Natural Landmark. In recent decades, several peregrine falcons have been found there.

Local mountains also include Goodwin , Bald , Hedgehog , Haystack , and Bartlett .

The town has a local weather recording and reporting station.

<text>Benson is a town in Rutland County, Vermont, United States. The population was 974 at the 2020 census. The town is rural, with a concentration of several homes and businesses in Benson village, at the intersection of Stage Road and Lake Road.

==Government==
As is the tradition of many towns in rural New England, the municipal government enjoys a degree of autonomy from the county and employs only a few essential service-providers. The democratically elected selectboard and town clerk decide on an annual budget for road crews, educators, and law enforcers. Town committees set the protocols of town policy with particular focus on the town&#x27;s annual budget, which is decided annually on Town Meeting Day. The Town Meeting is an assembly of all adult registered voters in the town, and the assembly usually draws a crowd approaching 40 citizens. These forty citizens help to determine the direction of town planning, in particular the areas of road maintenance, public safety, and local taxation.
==Public safety==
The town employs a town constable, but most law enforcement is handled by the Vermont State Police. The amount of crime in Benson is negligible when compared with the nearby communities of Orwell and Shoreham who respectively ranked second and tenth in recidivism and repeat offenders as of 2012. Even so, Benson has faced the growing drug epidemic in rural New England, and the use of illegal substances is on the rise across all ages and demographics.

Ambulance services are provided by Benson First Response and the Fair Haven Rescue Squad. The nearest hospitals are Rutland Regional Medical Center and Middlebury&#x27;s historic Porter Hospital. Benson also operates a small, entirely volunteer fire department, who respond to more motor vehicle crashes then fires. This volunteer department also sponsors an ice and swift water rescue team. . Assistance in fighting particularly large fires is provided by other neighboring volunteer fire departments, including Fair Haven, Castleton, Hubbardton, West Haven and Orwell, and Poultney. Similarly, Benson&#x27;s volunteer firefighters occasionally respond to large blazes and calls for water rescue in other local towns when the opportunity presents itself.

==Economy==
The local economy is driven by a number of small businesses centered in the central village center also known as the central business district centered on the intersection of Lake Road and Stage Road. The former C.J. Williamson store, a local greengrocery and gas station began the town&#x27;s economic development and differentiation from the greater Fair Haven area. The Williamson store opened in 1912, shortly after the proprietor survived a bear attack while hiking in the Green Mountains. Benson Village Store (AKA Williamson&#x27;s) Burned to the ground in April 2019 and was razed.

The Williamson store was soon joined by a tavern known as the Wheel Inn, which provides American fare and serves as the center of local intrigue. On the same site, there was an American Revolutionary War-era public house that served as a meeting place for American and British soldiers during the tense 1770s. The Wheel Inn remained in near-constant operation through the 2010s.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.36%, is water. Benson has of town roads.

The Benson Sycamore Tree is a local institution, located on Stage Road at the former estate of Lieutenant Colonel John Trutor. Before Lieutenant Colonel Trutor purchased the property on Stage Road, it was a local inn that served tourists who trekked through the state&#x27;s roads and railways. Two of the most famous individuals who stayed at the inn were John Blackburn and Karl Suessdorf, who wrote the song &quot;Moonlight in Vermont&quot; while staying at the inn. Blackburn and Seussdorf memorialized the Sycamore tree, a massive , in the song&#x27;s lyrics. A small plaque makes reference to this historical moment of musicianship on Stage Road, opposite the home.

==History==
In 1777, Walter Durfee, a Revolutionary War veteran from Massachusetts, made the first settlement in Benson. At that time the only road in town was the military road from Castleton to Ticonderoga, over which General St. Clair’s army passed on its retreat after the evacuation of Ticonderoga, on July 6, 1777. Durfee found his way through the woods by a bridle path made by the surveyors and followed their marks on the trees. During the summer and autumn of 1782, he was the only person who had a settled habitation in the town. He was originally from Freetown, Massachusetts but moved to Benson from Poultney. In 1780 he purchased the entire right of Isaac Clark, one of the original proprietors of Benson; and also the entire right of John G Rover, another original proprietor. In the spring of 1782, Durfee cleared the primeval forest and erected a log house on what was afterward known as the Home Farm. Durfee continued to reside on that farm until the spring of 1835 when he moved to West Chazy, New York, where he died in the summer of 1843, aged over 90 years. In the spring of 1783 Jonathan Meacham and Captain James Noble and his son, James Noble, Jr., came to Benson, and made preparations for settlement; and it is believed that they were removed here with their families in the autumn of that year.

While nobody seems to be quite sure as to the precise origin of the town&#x27;s name, most historians over the years have speculated that it was named for Egbert Benson, a respected lawyer and Revolutionary War officer, who was instrumental in negotiating the land claim which New York had made to Vermont—a congressionally mandated prerequisite for Vermont joining the Union as a state of its own, rather than being divided between New York and New Hampshire. Benson residents have entered into some disputes over the history of the town in the recent publication &quot;Remembering Benson&quot; over the origin of the town&#x27;s name. Lilian Snyder Philips Smith, who moved to Benson in 1948, claimed that her late husband Percy Phillips&#x27; great-great-grandfather Benson Philips was an early selectman responsible for chartering the town&#x27;s first primary school in 1813. This was contradicted by Leonard Lussier, who questioned Mrs. Snyder Philips Smith&#x27;s account as &quot;probably malarkey.&quot;

Benson&#x27;s political history has been checkered with Tory, Republican, Progressive, and Know Nothing sentiments. Local Historian Genevieve Trutor expressed surprise at Benson&#x27;s progressive streak, noting that the brief tenure of 1920s representative Susannah W. Nifong was surprising to locals as well as anyone who might consider the prevalent political conditions at the time. Mrs. Trutor was an active feminist agitator during her own time, arguing for women to be engaged in front-line combat during World War II.

The 1976 United States Bicentennial celebrations became a point of great national and town pride, as the town&#x27;s rivalry with neighboring Orwell intensified over which town would hold a better celebration. Although there was no formal victor, Benson&#x27;s parade still maintains an important part in the town&#x27;s history. Benson&#x27;s economy fell into a slump that it would not recover from until the late 2000s.

In 1994, the town became briefly infamous for failing to approve its school budget eighteen times before it finally passed, a national record at the time.

<text>Castleton is a town in Rutland County, Vermont, United States. Castleton is about to the west of Rutland, the county&#x27;s seat and most populous city, and about east of the New York/Vermont state border. The town had a population of 4,458 at the 2020 census. A campus of Vermont State University is located there, with roots dating to 1787.

==History==

Castleton was settled in 1770, and chartered in 1761. The charter for of land was granted by Governor Benning Wentworth of New Hampshire and divided the land into 70 &quot;rights&quot; or &quot;shares&quot;. Governor Wentworth retained ownership of two shares, and several others were given for churches and a school.

Three families had settled in Castleton by 1770. In the spring of 1767, some of the town&#x27;s first settlers, Amos Bird and Noah Lee, arrived in Castleton from Salisbury, Connecticut. Castleton&#x27;s favorite landmark, Birdseye Mountain, is named for Colonel Amos Bird. He had acquired 40 shares of land when the town was chartered and built a permanent residence there in the summer of 1769. More settlers followed, and by 1777 the town consisted of 17 families.

In May 1775 Ethan Allen and his Green Mountain Boys met in Castleton with Benedict Arnold to plan their next day&#x27;s attack on Fort Ticonderoga, west, on the New York side of Lake Champlain. Their successful capture of the fort was a holding action that lasted two years until the British launched a powerful sweep southward on Lake Champlain. The battle at nearby Hubbardton, followed by battles at Bennington and Saratoga, marked the turning point of the Revolutionary War in the North. Although German soldiers were stationed in Castleton for a time in 1777, they left as the fortunes of the war changed, and Tory sympathizers were treated with scorn by Castleton settlers. Fort Warren, built in 1777, was also located in Castleton.

The first medical school in Vermont was chartered here in 1818.

Following the war, Castleton continued to grow as an agricultural community. Farmers raised cattle, and then turned for a while to sheep. Saw mills and gristmills were the first industries established in town. During the 19th century the slate and marble industries thrived in and around Castleton. The railroad came in 1854, and the last half of the century saw the development of tourism around Lake Bomoseen. In the 19th century Castleton flourished, and many residents built elaborate houses to replace their log cabins and primitive frame houses. Several luxury hotels were built around the west end of the lake. A trolley system ran from the center of town to Lake Bomoseen, a destination for tourists vacationing during the summer. The Hydeville area flourished in the mid-19th century as a slate quarrying and milling center.

Between 1900 and 1940 several fires occurred in Castleton Village, Castleton Corners and Hydeville, as well as at the lakeside resorts. Despite this destruction of hotels and the original commercial and industrial areas of its villages, the town of Castleton retains an architectural heritage spanning two hundred years of Vermont history. Castleton&#x27;s mile-long tree-shaded Main Street, with its array of Federal and Greek Revival style houses and public buildings, many by builder Thomas Royal Dake, has been listed almost in its entirety on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Arts and culture==

===Museums and other points of interest ===
The Higley House was built in 1810 by Erastus Higley, and houses antiques and furnishings. Antique carriages are located on the grounds. The house is now maintained by the Castleton Historical Society, and was built and lived in by the Higley family until 1973.

The Castleton Federated Church was built in 1833 by master builder Thomas Dake. The church is listed in the Historic American Buildings Survey.

The Cobbler&#x27;s Shop is an old brick building on the corner of Main Street and Cemetery Road. It was built at some point between 1774 and 1794 by Nehemiah Hoyt, some people believe it to be the oldest brick building in Vermont.

The Castleton Medical Chapel was built in 1821 as part of Castleton University (Castleton State College at the time). It is located on Seminary Street close to the Fine Arts Center.

<text>Clarendon is a town in Rutland County, Vermont, United States. The population was 2,412 at the 2020 census. Clarendon spans U.S. Route 7 and is split by the highway, the Cold River and Mill River, Otter Creek, and the Green Mountains into the hamlets of Clarendon, West Clarendon, East Clarendon, Clarendon Springs, and North Clarendon

==History==

The area that later formed the Town of Clarendon was settled by families from lower New England as early as 1762. It and the surrounding area was then part of Albany County, New York, but was later split off as Charlotte County until Vermont declared itself as a republic around 1777. Land claims by New Hampshire were eventually settled, and in 1791 Vermont became a state.

Clarendon now includes the following entries on the National Register of Historic Places:
* Brown Covered Bridge – bridges the Cold River on Cold River Road in North Clarendon. NOTE: The Brown Covered Bridge is actually on the Upper Cold River Road in Shrewsbury and was damaged during the flooding from Hurricane Irene (added February 21, 1974)
* Clarendon Congregational Church – Middle Rd. (added August 12, 1984)
* Clarendon House – off VT 133 in Clarendon Springs (added June 17, 1976)

* Cold River Bridge – VT 7B over the Cold R. (added December 14, 1991)
* East Clarendon Railroad Station – VT 103 and East Rd. (added April 8, 1999)

<text>Killington is a town in Rutland County, Vermont, United States. The population was 1,407 at the 2020 census. Killington Ski Resort and numerous vacation lodges are located here. The town was previously named Sherburne, but was renamed to its original name, &quot;Killington&quot;, in 1999.

== History ==

The town of Killington was chartered on July 7, 1761, by a New Hampshire grant. In 1800, it was renamed Sherburne after landholder Colonel Benjamin Sherburne. The town voted to revert to its original name of Killington on March 2, 1999; which was approved by the Vermont General Assembly and became effective July 1, 1999.

The 2007 town meeting considered a proposal to impose a three-cent surcharge on every dollar of property tax revenue. The proceeds would have been used to fund a town economic development group. The surcharge was not approved by the voters.

Killington was one of thirteen Vermont towns isolated by flooding caused by Hurricane Irene on August 28, 2011. Killington was cut off for 19 days.

=== Secession referendums ===

Killington&#x27;s voters have twice voted to secede from Vermont and join the State of New Hampshire, to the east. The movement stems from what some residents perceive as an inequity in taxes sent to the state of Vermont, for services received. The votes are largely symbolic, as secession is highly unlikely and would require the agreement of both states&#x27; legislatures, as well as that of the U.S. Congress.

==Geography==

<text>Pittsfield is a town in Rutland County, Vermont, United States. The population was 504 at the 2020 census. It is the site of the annual Pittsfield Snowshoe Race.

==History==
Granted on November 8, 1780, the town was chartered on July 29, 1781, to Samuel Wilcox and 129 others. Pittsfield was named after Pittsfield, Massachusetts, which itself had been named in honor of William Pitt. It was first settled in 1786. The town proved suitable for grazing livestock because of its mountainous terrain. Indeed, in the 19th century, humorists attributed the invention of the one-legged milking stool to Pittsfield, &quot;...as a means of conquering a stern difficulty.&quot;
The Farmhouse pictured in this 1915 Postcard to the left still stands 
and was converted in 1960 to The Fleur De Lis Lodge, for travelers and
skiers to stay. Six rooms remain in the original farmhouse, while 
seven more rooms were added to the new section above the great room.

Pittfield was one of thirteen Vermont towns isolated by flooding caused by Tropical Storm Irene in 2011.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land. Set among the Green Mountains, Pittsfield is drained by the Tweed River, a tributary of the White River.

The town is crossed by Vermont Route 100.

==Demographics==

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.47% of the population.

There were 190 households, out of which 24.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 55.3% were married couples living together, 4.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.8% were non-families. 25.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.25 and the average family size was 2.73.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 19.9% under the age of 18, 3.5% from 18 to 24, 30.4% from 25 to 44, 30.7% from 45 to 64, and 15.5% who were 65 years of age or older.

==Notable events==
In August 2011, Pittsfield became known as one of the most isolated Vermont towns when Tropical Storm Irene destroyed parts of Vermont Route 100 between Killington and Bethel, preventing vehicle travel in and out of the town for weeks. The Giorgetti Covered Bridge was completely destroyed by flood waters, along with 8 homes. As with so many other towns in the area, the geography of this small village has changed significantly; this flood has been compared to the Great Vermont Flood of 1927.

<text>Proctor is a town in Rutland County, Vermont, United States. The population was 1,763 at the 2020 census. Proctor is home to the Vermont Marble Museum and Wilson Castle.

==History==
In the early 19th century, small high-quality marble deposits were discovered in Rutland, and in the 1830s a large deposit of nearly solid marble of high quality was found in what is now West Rutland. By the 1840s small firms had begun operations, but marble quarries only became profitable when the railroad came to Rutland in 1851. At the same time, the famous quarries of Carrara in Tuscany, Italy, became largely unworkable because of their extreme depth, and Rutland quickly became one of the leading producers of marble in the world.

This fueled enough growth and investment that in 1886 the marble companies saw to it that when the present Rutland City was incorporated as a village, most of the town was split off as West Rutland and Proctor, which between them contained the bulk of the marble quarries. Proctor was formed around the nucleus of the old Sutherland Falls from parts of Rutland and Pittsford. Proctor was named for and almost completely owned by Senator Redfield Proctor. The closing of the marble quarries in the town in the 1980s and 1990s cost the area many jobs, and Proctor has struggled much more than its neighbors. In 2004 the Proctor Marble Arch Bridge restoration project was the recipient of the Marble Institute Award of Merit for &quot;commitment to preservation of the original stonework.&quot;

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which , or 0.39%, is water. Drained by Otter Creek, Proctor lies between the Taconic Range and Green Mountains.

<text>Berlin ( ) is a town in Washington County, Vermont, United States, founded in 1763.

The population was 2,849 at the 2020 census. Being the town between Barre and Montpelier, the two largest cities in the region, much of the commercial business of the region can be found in Berlin, including parts of the Barre-Montpelier Road (U.S. Route 302), and the Berlin Mall.

==History==

Berlin was chartered June 8, 1763. The name refers to Berlin, Germany, and was the only German town name in this new English colony. The grantees who received the 70 original rights to the township were priests, merchants and judges. The charter was issued by the Royal Governor of New Hampshire, Benning Wentworth, and stated that each &quot;proprietor, settler or inhabitant&quot; should pay one ear of Indian corn for each acre of land, and after ten years, one shilling for each 100 acres.

It took 22 years until the first settlers arrived in the area: Ebenezer Sanborn coming from nearby Corinth, founding the &quot;Bradford farm&quot;, and Joseph Thurber from New Hampshire, founding the &quot;Shepard farm&quot;. Both left a year later for New York state.

In 1788 a legislature of the state of Vermont stated that &quot;the town of Randolph, Braintree, Brookfield, Roxbury, Williamstown, Northfield, Wildersburgh, Berlin and Montpelier [...] hereby are formed into one entire probate district, by the name of the district of Randolph.&quot;

Jacob Fowler, a hunter, was the first settler who stayed and left descendants in town. Other early settlers were Moses Smith, Daniel Morse, John Lathrop, and Hezekiah Silloway. In 1789 thirteen families lived in Berlin, and eight more in 1790. The first child born in Berlin was Abigail Black (1789).

The first town meeting was held on March 31, 1791. The first sawmill was built in the same year, the first school (on East Street) in 1794. The first Christian institution was founded in 1798, with James Hobart as its minister. A Congregational meeting house opened at Berlin center in 1803. After it burned down in 1838 the Congregational Church was built at Berlin Corner.

The first store and tavern opened and closed in 1850.

<text>Calais is a town in Washington County, Vermont, United States. The population was 1,661 at the 2020 census. Calais contains the unincorporated communities of Adamant, East Calais, North Calais, Kent&#x27;s Corner, Maple Corner and Pekin.

==History==

Colonel Jacob Davis named Calais after the French port city of the same name, during a time of general enthusiasm for things French as a result of France&#x27;s aid during the American Revolution.

The Wheelocks and Parkers were the first families to settle the town, in the latter part of the 18th century. In the early and mid 19th century, the Vermont wool industry spawned sheep pastures in the town. Photographs of the time show a heavily de-forested Calais. Like many small Vermont towns, Calais was devastated by the Civil War. Volunteers from Calais flocked to the Union cause, most serving in the Army&#x27;s volunteer regiments. In the post-Civil War era, agriculture turned from sheep to dairy, and new families came to fill farms that were sold by the families and widows of Civil War veterans.

===Historical landmarks===

* Kents Corner
* Old West Church
* Maple Corner
* Robinson Saw Mill
* Adamant Co-op

===Village histories===

Calais once had a village called Sodom. This name was allegedly given because the village had no church, though it did have a few active quarries. In 1905, the residents petitioned the state legislature to change the name to Adamant, chosen to suggest the hardness of granite.

Pekin is named after Peking (now Beijing), China, the result of a local farmer who had a friend who was a missionary to China. The missionary sent some Chinese wheat back to Vermont, the farmer planted it, and it flourished. It became the style to give directions using the wheat field as a landmark (&quot;up by the Pekin wheat&quot;, or &quot;just past the Pekin wheat&quot;). Eventually, the location of the field came to be known simply as Pekin. Another version suggests that the missionary sent back rice, and that the farmer planted the rice in a low-lying plain, which flooded each spring. The river came to be known as Peking Brook, later and presently Pekin Brook.

<text>Middlesex is a town in Washington County, Vermont, United States. The population was 1,779 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 39.9 square miles (103.2 km2), of which 39.7 square miles (102.7 km2) is land and 0.2 square mile (0.5 km2), or 0.53%, is water.

==History==

The town of Middlesex was granted by royal charter on June 8, 1763, by New Hampshire colonial governor Benning Wentworth. The town takes its boundaries from Waterbury, incorporated the previous day, and Worcester, which received its grant the same day as Middlesex. The source of the town&#x27;s name is uncertain but it is supposed Wentworth, or a staff member, chose the name for its location between Waterbury and Worcester. Another possibility would be that Wentworth chose Middlesex to seek favor from English nobleman Charles Sackville who held the title Lord Middlesex until 1765, when he became Duke of Dorset.

The town remained largely undeveloped through the period of the Vermont Republic and early Vermont statehood, with settlements in the village and Putnamville. The Putnam family were among the first settlers of the town. Seth Putnam was elected first town clerk in 1790; brothers Isaac and Jacob Putnam were elected town surveyors.
Middlesex village, situated along the Winooski River, is the town&#x27;s chief settlement and location of the town hall. Middlesex Village obtained a post office in 1821 (that office closed in 1966). Middlesex Center is, as the name suggests, in the near center of the town situated northwest of the Great Brook and Brook Road. Shady Rill is rolling, mostly lowland where three brooks-Herrick, Martins, and Patterson, each named for a local family, converge with the North Branch which runs south to Wrightsville and Montpelier. A northern affiliation Baptist church was built in Shady Rill in 1849. The village of Putnamville is located along the town&#x27;s eastern border along the North Branch River. A waterfall there once powered grist and saw mills. A post office was opened in Putnamville, incongruously titled Putnamsville, in 1882 (this post office closed in 1935).

Wrightsville, just south of Putnamville, was once a sizable settlement with nearly 30 built structures, and several mills. The Wrightsville Dam, built by the Civilian Conservation Corps 1933-35 in response to the 1927 flood, caused that settlement to be disbanded. The Northbranch Cemetery was moved southwest to Portal Road, and a majority of the mostly Greek Revival houses were moved west up the hill to where the old Hood place presently stands. Off Portal Road and Bolduc Road is Tangletown Road, which takes its name from an area of town nicknamed Tangletown because the woods there are so thick and so alike that settlers reported getting &quot;tangled up&quot; (lost) in the area.

The town had a large bear population well into the late nineteenth century. A recorded story tells of a farmer located between Middlesex Center and Bear Swamp finding one of his sheep killed by a bear. The farmer and his wife immediately walked their property to take stock of their flock. The farmer spotted a bear and killed it, soon afterward his wife called out that she sighted one and he shot that one, the couple returned to the barnyard and spotted a third bear-this one eating another of their sheep, and the farmer shot that bear as well. The area received the nickname Beartown.

Through most of the nineteenth century and well into the mid-twentieth century, the primary economic activity was farming. Dairy farming, sheep herding (for wool), logging, orchards and maple sugaring have all been part of the town&#x27;s economy. Following the end of World War II, the town slowly transitioned to becoming a place to live for people who worked elsewhere, mostly in Montpelier.

==Demographics==

==Culture==

Although Plainfield is similar to many other rural New England towns by the numbers (size, population, etc.), it has a distinct flair which sets it apart from most surrounding communities. Goddard College attracts a liberal, educated population that at one time made up a significant portion of the townspeople. Goddard alumni include Mumia Abu-Jamal, members of the band Phish, David Mamet, Piers Anthony, Mary Edwards, onetime State historian H. Allen Soule Jr., and abstract artists including Robert M. Fisher and James Gahagan. Plainfield was home to noted composer and builder of the first American village style gamelan, Dennis Murphy. J.Willis Pratt is still alive.

The town currently has two restaurants; one located in the village center with New York-style pizza, and the other a cafe on US Route 2. The village also has a community food co-op and community center open to non-members and featuring local products, a used bookshop, and a community maintained flower garden, all within several hundred feet of each other. The town has a unique public library, the Cutler Memorial Library, and is home to an environmentally progressive biodiesel station. Plainfield is also home to the historic Allenwood Farm.

Plainfield&#x27;s atmosphere is distinct from popular tourist destinations in Vermont such as Stowe, and Woodstock in that its commercial activity is generated primarily by local residents. There are a number of active local groups such as the Plainfield Historical Society and the Plainfield Area Community Association, which sponsor community activities, like the annual Old Home Days.

Plainfield, like a number of Vermont towns, retains the influence of the back-to-the-land movement of the 1960s. A number of people came to stay for good and continue to run organic farms. This older generation has now joined with the newer, younger sustainable agriculture movement and the food renaissance in Vermont. While the college, Goddard, has suffered a decline in recent years, the town nevertheless retains an ethos of activism, community and solidarity (except on Town Meeting day when everyone voices their opinion loudly). Community spirit and solidarity was demonstrated in 2013, when the town raised the most money per capita for Vermont Public Radio and thus earned an Ice Cream Social from Ben and Jerry&#x27;s. The radio station housed at Goddard College, WGDR, continues to serve as a community voice and link for area residents. The newly renovated Plainfield Town Hall Opera House () boasts a footprint of 55&#x27; 9&quot; along the eaves, 42&#x27; 4&quot; across the gables, and is a popular destination for local concerts and performances.

<text>Roxbury is a town in Washington County, Vermont, United States, created by Vermont charter on August 6, 1781. The population was 678 at the 2020 census.

==Geography and wildlife==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 41.8 square miles (108.3 km2), of which 41.8 square miles (108.2 km2) is land and 0.04 square mile (0.1 km2) (0.10%) is water.

Roxbury is the southernmost town of Washington County; it is bordered by Northfield (to the north), Warren (to the west), Granville (to the south and southwest), Braintree (to the southeast), and Brookfield (to the east). The town is located some southwest of Montpelier, the state capital. Roxbury is bisected by Vermont Route 12A, which runs through the town in a north-south direction. Roxbury includes the headwaters of the Dog River and White River; the former flows north into the Winooski River, while the latter flows south into Connecticut River. The geographic center of Vermont is located three miles east of Roxbury village.

Roxbury is heavily mountainous and forested, featuring some of the area&#x27;s most rugged terrain. More than 85% of the land surface area of the town is forested, including of state land and more than of privately owned land that is enrolled in the state&#x27;s Use Value Program.

More than twenty points within the town have an elevation of more than ; elevations in the town range from a low of (along the Third Branch of the White River) to a high of (at the peak of Rice Mountain). Rice Mountain lies in the Northfield range of the Green Mountains along the western boundary of the town.

==History==
Roxbury was granted by the Vermont General Assembly in 1781; its name is likely derived from Roxbury, Massachusetts, which later became part of Boston. The town was chartered on August 6, 1781, to Benjamin Edwards and 64 other people, although just 20 of these ever lived in the town. Actual European settlement began in 1789, and the first town meeting was held in 1797.

The town grew steadily in the first six decades of the 19th century, growing from 113 residents in 1800 to a peak of 1,060 residents in 1860, on the eve of the American Civil War. In the war, 94 Roxbury men served; 29 perished. The town&#x27;s population dropped in the 20th century after World War II, especially after the town&#x27;s marble quarries (which opened in 1857) were closed in
1957; the city&#x27;s population reached a low point in 1970, with just 354 residents. Subsequently, however, the town has made a rebound, with the population rising to 691 in 2010.

==Economy==
Historically, Roxbury&#x27;s economy was highly dependent upon resource extraction; major economic activities included agriculture, logging, fishing, and quarrying. Verde Antique marble quarrying and talc mining were historically significant in Roxbury; today, one commercial sand and gravel extraction operation is located in the town. Roxbury&#x27;s marble quarries opened in 1857 and closed in 1957.

In modern times, 80% of Roxbury workers are employed outside the town. From the 1970s onward, many Roxbury residents have commuted to Montpelier and Barre for work.

The Central Vermont Public Service Corporation and the Washington Electric Co-op are electric utilities for the town, although some residents live off-the-grid using alternative energy.

==Government, law enforcement, and fire protection== 
Town voters elect three members of the select board. The members of the select board have three-year terms and are responsible for carrying out a variety of duties, including &quot;warning&quot; (posting notice of) town meetings; enacting and enforcing town ordinances; proposing a town budget; overseeing town employees; authorizing expenditures; and appointing seven members of the town Planning
Commission. The select board members, together with the local justices of the peace, make up the Board of Civil Authority. The select board is assisted in the administration of town affairs by a town clerk, an assistant town clerk, and a town treasurer; the latter two officials are part-time. Other elected town officials include three listers, who are responsible for property tax assessments and other duties; three auditors, who prepare an annual Town Report; and three school directors who oversee public education.

Roxbury does not have a police department; the Vermont State Police enforces laws as needed. Roxbury&#x27;s town constable lacks law enforcement authority; rather, the constable &quot;makes occasional checks on seasonal homes and hunting camps, assists the State Police in case of accidents and other emergencies, serves subpoenas and restraining orders, and receives occasional calls regarding nuisance situations.&quot;

Roxbury has a volunteer fire department, which as of 2014 consisted of ten active volunteers.

==Points of interest==
* The Roxbury State Fish Hatchery, the state&#x27;s first fish hatchery, was built in 1891. The hatchery continued to operate—and to draw up to 2,800 visitors each summer—until it suffered catastrophic damage from Hurricane Irene in August 2011. The state is rebuilding the hatchery.
* Historic cemeteries in the town are several cemeteries include First Settlers, Orcutt, West Hill, Village, East Roxbury and Roxbury Flats.
* The local historical society &quot;is housed in a small building that was for many years the Town Clerk&#x27;s Office&quot;; its collection includes a variety of historic items.
* Camp Windridge at Teela Wooket is a privately owned tennis, soccer, and horseback riding camp. The camp was originally established by Claude and Florence Roys in 1913 and initially operated as &quot;an exclusive girls&#x27; camp&quot;; the camp was sold in 1989.
* The Roxbury Free Library, which has about 5,000 volumes.

<doc id="137425" wikidata="Q816044" url="?curid=137425" title="Bellows Falls, Vermont">
<text>Bellows Falls is an incorporated village located in the town of Rockingham in Windham County, Vermont, United States. The population was 2,747 at the 2020 census. Bellows Falls is home to the Green Mountain Railroad, a heritage railroad; the annual Roots on the River Festival; and the No Film Film Festival.

==History==
The community was settled in 1753 by colonists of English descent, who called it Great Falls. Later the settlers renamed the town for Colonel Benjamin Bellows, a landowner, but kept the name Great Falls for the waterfall, a translation of their Abenaki name, &quot;Kitchee pontegu.&quot; In 1785, Colonel Enoch Hale built at the falls the first bridge over the Connecticut River. It was the only bridge across the river until 1796, when another was built at Springfield, Massachusetts. The bridge was later replaced. Two bridges currently link Bellows Falls to New Hampshire: the New Arch Bridge (also called the Church Street Bridge), which replaced the Arch Bridge in 1982, and the Vilas Bridge.

The Bellows Falls Canal, one of the first canals built in the United States, was dug by a British-owned company from 1791 to 1802. The original canal was 22 feet wide and four feet deep, and had 9 locks, each 75 feet long and 20 feet wide, which allowed shipping to go around Great Falls by being lifted 52 feet (16 m) around the gorge. River traffic declined after railroads were built to the Connecticut Valley in 1849, and by 1858 the canal had become used exclusively for water power to run the paper mills which became established there. In 1874 the canal was enlarged to 75 feet wide and 17 feet deep. By 1908 it was delivering 15,000 horsepower to the mills. When the mills replaced water power with electrical power, the canal was widened again in 1927–28 to 100 feet, and the water was used to power turbines to generate electricity. The canal&#x27;s bottom was lined with concrete, and the sides secured with rip-rap set in concrete. A fish ladder allows salmon to continue upstream at times when the bulk of the river&#x27;s flow is diverted to the canal. The canal is now part of the Bellows Falls Downtown Historic District.

In 1802, entrepreneurs built the first paper mill in Windham County. Two railroads converged in 1849 at Bellows Falls, helping it develop into a major mill town. By 1859, a woolen textile mill was operating, in addition to factories that produced furniture, marble, sashes and blinds, iron castings, carriages, cabinetware, rifles, harness, shoe pegs and organs.

The years of industry created wealth in the town, and substantial Victorian houses and mercantile buildings were constructed. Bellows Falls today attracts visitors through heritage tourism based on its historic Victorian architecture. The commercial town center, along with the canal, the bridges spanning it, and several neighborhoods of houses, were listed as historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places, as were individual landmarks such as the historic railroad station and the Adams Gristmill Warehouse.

==Geography==
The village is located within the town of Rockingham. According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land. Bellows Falls is bounded on the east by the Connecticut River.

<text>Parchim is a former &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the southwestern part of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany. Neighboring districts were (from the north clockwise) Nordwestmecklenburg, Güstrow, Müritz, the district Prignitz in Brandenburg, the district Ludwigslust and the district-free city Schwerin. The district was disbanded at the district reform of September 2011. Its territory has been part of the Ludwigslust-Parchim district since.

==Geography==
Most of the district is now agriculturally used, but in the easternmost part there are several lakes, the largest of them being the Plauer See (39 km2). The Plauer See marks the western end of the Müritz lakeland.

==History==
In 1994 the three districts of Parchim, Sternberg and Lübz were merged into the enlarged district of Parchim. The borders of this new district were roughly identical with the medieval principality of Parchim-Riechenberg, which existed between 1238 and 1316. This district was merged with the district of Ludwigslust at the district reform of September 2011, forming the new Ludwigslust-Parchim district.

<doc id="137429" wikidata="Q1265111" url="?curid=137429" title="Dummerston, Vermont">
<text>Dummerston is a town in Windham County, Vermont, United States. The population was 1,865 at the 2020 census. It is home to the longest covered bridge still in use in Vermont. Its borders include three main villages: Dummerston Center, West Dummerston, and East Dummerston.

==History==
 According to the book 1491 by Charles Mann, Dummerston was stolen from Native Americans by Europeans. 
Dummerston was part of the Equivalent Lands—several large sections of land given to settlers in the early eighteenth century. It lies on a tract given to the Connecticut Colony about 1715 by the Province of Massachusetts Bay as compensation for land mistakenly awarded by the latter to its settlers. In 1716, the town was auctioned to a consortium (which included William Dummer, lieutenant governor of Massachusetts), and named Dummerston. On December 26, 1753, the town was chartered as a New Hampshire grant and renamed Fulham by Governor Benning Wentworth. But when the grant was renegotiated, it reverted to Dummerston.

The many brooks and streams flowing into the West River provided the area with water power. Dummerston had five gristmills, five sawmills, one slate manufacturer, and one shop for making rakes. Raising sheep across the many hills was an important occupation. By 1859, the town had a population of 1,645. The Vermont Valley Railroad passed through Dummerston.

A house built in Dummerston in 1892, &quot;Naulakha&quot;, was home to author Rudyard Kipling. This is where he wrote several of his novels, including &quot;The Jungle Books&quot; and &quot;Captains Courageous&quot;.

There was a covered bridge that was built in 1812, and it moved to Old Sturbridge Village in 1946.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 30.8 square miles (79.8 km2), of which 30.6 square miles (79.2 km2) is land and 0.2 square mile (0.6 km2) (0.71%) is water. Dummerston is bounded by the Connecticut River, and the West River flows through the town.

The town is crossed by Interstate 91 (Exit 4 serves the town and the exit sits on the border of Dummerston and Putney), U.S. Route 5 and Vermont Route 30. It is bordered by Brattleboro to the south, Marlboro and Newfane to the west, with Putney and Brookline to the north. Chesterfield, New Hampshire lies across the Connecticut River from it.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 1,915 people, 796 households, and 543 families residing in the town. The population density was 62.6 people per square mile (24.2/km2). There were 893 housing units at an average density of 29.2 per square mile (11.3/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 98.33% White, 0.05% African American, 0.63% Asian, 0.05% from other races, and 0.94% from two or more races.

There were 796 households, out of which 31.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 58.0% were married couples living together, 6.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31.7% were non-families. Of all households 25.4% were made up of individuals, and 6.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.41 and the average family size was 2.89.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 23.1% under the age of 18, 5.1% from 18 to 24, 26.8% from 25 to 44, 31.1% from 45 to 64, and 13.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 42 years. For every 100 females, there were 101.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.1 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $46,121, and the median income for a family was $53,375. Males had a median income of $35,664 versus $26,174 for females.

== Politics and government ==

Dummerston, like many New England counties and localities, uses a board of selectmen as its executive body and Town Meeting for legislative functions. In 2014, it had five selectmen forming up its selectboard. One of its most famous selectmen was Motel 6 spokesmodel and author Tom Bodett, who served on the selectboard as of 2013.

==Sites of interest==

Dummerston has several interesting sites within its borders.

The longest covered bridge that is still in use in the state of Vermont is the West Dummerston Covered Bridge. Built in two spans which rest on a central pier, the bridge boasts a combined length of 267 feet along the floor. The gable ends overhang the floor at each end of the bridge by two feet; therefore, along the top of the trusses, the bridge is 271 feet long.

Dummerston is home to the 1,009 acre Black Mountain Conservation Area. Black Mountain rises abruptly from the West River into a horseshoe-shaped ridge. The mountain has a summit of 1,280 feet.

Author Rudyard Kipling made Dummerston home, building a house that he named Naulakha. It was there that he wrote his famous story, &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, and invented the sport of Snow Golf. Naulakha is now a museum available for overnight stays. The house is a National Historic Landmark.

The Dummerston Grange periodically hosts the Vermont Theatre Company.

<text>Grafton is a town in Windham County, Vermont, United States. The population was 645 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In the early 19th century, sheep raising became popular and multiple woolen mills sprang up along the branches of the Saxtons River. Soapstone was quarried on nearby Bear Mountain. The town became a notable stagecoach hub for traffic across the Green Mountains into Albany, New York. One inn from that era, &quot;the Old Tavern,&quot; was founded in 1801. It remains one of the oldest continually operating hotels in the United States. It is now called The Grafton Inn.

Grafton had a population of almost 1,500 just before the American Civil War. The town suffered severe losses during the Civil War. Local cemeteries in the village hold many tombstones of casualties from the Battle of Gettysburg. After the war, the community declined in population. The soapstone quarry was depleted and closed late in the 19th century. Around the time of the Great Depression, the town&#x27;s population was less than 400.

In the 1960s the Windham Foundation was established to help restore the village. It purchased the Old Tavern and many residences in the area. The foundation also established an artisanal cheese business, the Grafton Village Cheese Company, and built a world-class cross-country skiing center at Grafton Ponds that offers a popular mountain biking program for children in the summer months. The restoration efforts attracted new residents from metropolitan New York and Boston.

==Etymology==
The town was founded as Thomlinson in 1754, but renaming rights were auctioned in 1791. The high bidder, who reportedly offered &quot;five dollars and a jug of rum,&quot; changed the name to Grafton after his home town of Grafton, Massachusetts.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 38.4 square miles (99.5 km2), of which 38.4 square miles (99.4 km2) is land and 0.03% is water. The village of Grafton is slightly southeast of the geographic center of the town, in the valley of the Saxtons River.

<doc id="137434" wikidata="Q3450853" url="?curid=137434" title="Jamaica, Vermont">
<text>Jamaica is a town in Windham County, Vermont, United States. The population was 1,005 at the 2020 census. The town includes the villages of Jamaica, East Jamaica and Rawsonville.

Its ZIP code is 05343. The town is home to Jamaica State Park, noted for scenic camping spots and various swimming holes, including Hamilton Falls. The nearest large town is Brattleboro.

==History==
In the colonial period, what is now Vermont was disputed territory, with land claims from both New York and New Hampshire. The original grants for this area, issued by the Royal Governor of New York in 1767 and 1772, were for two towns. But in 1777, the Republic of Vermont was established. Ignoring the previous grants, it gave charter on November 7, 1780, for “a tract of vacant land within this state which has not heretofore been granted.”

The charter goes on to say “that the same be and is hereby Incorporated into a Township by the name of Jamaica”—its name from the Natick word for beaver and not the Caribbean island. The grant encompassed forty-two square miles, at an altitude ranging from above sea level along the West River to on The Pinnacle. On the charter were listed sixty-seven grantees, many of whose surnames can be found among residents today.

Earliest settlement of the town was along the West River near the Wardsboro Bridge, now called East Jamaica, where the first school was established in 1791; however, the building of new roads and bridges towards Manchester advanced settlement westward, so that by 1800 the town center was shifting to Jamaica Village. Within the entire forty-two square-mile township developed as many as ten separate hamlets, each surrounded by outlying farms and linked to Jamaica Village by a network of roads. Eventually there were as many as fourteen one-room schools which served the families in the outlying areas.

In the first quarter of the nineteenth century, Jamaica Village also assumed increasing importance as a manufacturing center, largely for topographical reasons. Located near the confluence of the West River and Ball Mountain Brook, the area offered a strategic location for bridges, dams and mills. Along Ball Mountain Brook alone there were numerous dams, each providing power for at least one mill. The first store, Noon House, was built in 1803. The popularity of Noon House led to the building in 1814 of Jamaica House, which provided a convenient overnight spot for travelers at the midpoint between Manchester and Brattleboro.
Like many Vermont communities, the town&#x27;s economy prospered with the introduction of Merino sheep in the early nineteenth century. The sheep flourished on rocky hillsides, and as their numbers increased, bare land replaced forests, but this prosperity did not last. The depression that followed the Civil War, and the decline in the wool market, took their toll on the economy.

Many sons of Jamaica served with the Union Army during the Civil War. Windham County contributed heavily to manning the 4th Vermont Infantry and nearly all of Jamaica&#x27;s men joined Company I of that regiment. This regiment saw heavy combat throughout the war but the Battle of the Wilderness took the greatest toll on those from the village of Jamaica. One of Jamaica&#x27;s soldiers, Sergeant Henry W. Downs of Company I, 8th Vermont Infantry, won the Medal of Honor for bravery under fire.

In 1869, a great flood carried away “a mile of bridges” and damaged every dam on Ball Mountain Brook. Because of its setting near the river and the region&#x27;s heavy snows, Jamaica has suffered through many damaging floods in the more than two hundred years since its founding.

During this period, Jamaica and other towns in the West River Valley bonded together in a venture that was seen as the salvation of the area’s economic woes, the West River Railroad. Originally chartered in 1867, the proposed railroad was to run from Brattleboro to Whitehall, New York. In 1877, financing provided by the valley towns moved the languishing project forward with the first segment from Brattleboro to Londonderry. Although it was never extended farther, the railroad provided valuable public transportation for the lower West River Valley until the 1930s, by which time automobile ownership had become almost universal.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 946 people, 416 households, and 245 families residing in the town. The population density was 19.2 people per square mile (7.4/km2). There were 967 housing units at an average density of 19.6 per square mile (7.6/km2).

Like all Vermont towns, Jamaica has an annual town meeting on the first Tuesday of March each year. At Town Meeting, residents of the town deliberate and vote on an annual budget, elect municipal officials, and vote on public questions. Jamaica is one of the few towns where all business is still conducted &quot;from the floor&quot;—i.e. through parliamentary procedure, as even candidates for elected office are nominated from the floor.

<text>Marlboro is a town in Windham County, Vermont, United States. The population was 1,722 at the 2020 census. The town is home to the Southern Vermont Natural History Museum and Potash Hill, the campus that was formerly Marlboro College. Potash Hill hosts the Marlboro Music School and Festival each summer, as well as other arts and education programs throughout the year.

==History==

Named &quot;New Marlborough&quot; for the Duke of Marlborough until 1800, the town was a New Hampshire grant chartered on April 29, 1751, to Timothy Dwight and 64 others from Northampton, Massachusetts and vicinity. The French and Indian War prevented settlement, so the first charter was forfeited and a new one issued by Governor Benning Wentworth on September 21, 1761, then again on April 17, 1764, as New Marlborough. The town was surveyed in 1762, and 64 equal &quot;rights&quot; (divisions) were created, with four lots in the center of town excepted. First settled in 1763, the town grew rapidly between 1764 and 1770 with emigrants from Massachusetts and Connecticut. By 1799 there were 313 children registered in the town&#x27;s schools.

The town&#x27;s population peaked in 1820 with 1300 people, the subsequent decline caused by immigration to the west and a downturn in the area&#x27;s economy. Although the terrain is mountainous, the soil is rich and deep, which allowed farmers to grow good crops. When the population was 896 in 1859, the community was almost exclusively agricultural.

===Town Common===


Located on the Town Common are the Town House (1822), used for town meetings, the Town Offices and Post Office building (1969), the Marlboro Meeting House Congregational Church (1931), and the Whetstone Inn ().

The town&#x27;s first church was organized in 1776, and put up at the top of Town Hill in 1778. In 1820, it was replaced by a newer structure nearby, and timbers and board from the old church were used in 1822 to build the Town House, which was also located in the vicinity. Between 1836 and 1844 both of these buildings—the church and the Town House—were moved down the hill to about their current locations on the Town Common. The church burned down in 1931 was replaced by the current one, which is roughly a reproduction of its predecessor, except slightly smaller.

After the move down the hill, Town House was on the east side of South Road, but when it was hit by a new, oversized snow plow in 1966, it was moved across the road to its current location.

The Whetstone Inn was built around 1775 by Deacon Jonas Whitney, who arrived in Marlboro in 1773. Over its history, it has been various used as a courthouse, church, tavern, dance hall and post office.

=== 20th century ===
In 1946, Marlboro College was founded on the site of three farms by Walter Hendricks, for returning World War II veterans, with poet Robert Frost as its first trustee. The Marlboro Music School and Festival, founded in 1951, is held each summer on the Potash Hill campus.

=== 21st century ===
In 2006, Marlboro was one of the first American towns to have its citizens pass a resolution endorsing the impeachment of President George W. Bush, and in 2011 it was one of thirteen Vermont towns isolated by flooding caused by Hurricane Irene.

<text>Putney is a town in Windham County, Vermont, United States. The population was 2,617 at the 2020 census.

The town&#x27;s historic core makes up the Putney Village Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==

On December 26, 1753, Colonel Josiah Willard led a proprietors&#x27; petition for a Putney charter to be established in the Equivalent Lands. The charter was issued that day by Governor Benning Wentworth – issuer of the New Hampshire Grants under the authority of King George II of Great Britain. Significant settlement of Putney did not begin until after the French and Indian War ended in 1763.

The town arose in a large plain on the west side of the Connecticut River, above the mouth of Sacketts Brook. A falls on the brook provided water power for early mills, and it is around that point that the main village was formed. Because the town did not have abundant sources of water power, it was largely bypassed by the Industrial Revolution of the mid-19th century, and remained largely rural in character. The village&#x27;s character is defined by the Federal and Greek Revival styles popular during its most significant period of growth, the late 18th to mid-19th century.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 26.8 square miles (69.4 km2), of which 26.76 square miles (69.4 km2) is land and 0.04% is water. Putney Mountain is the highest point in the town, rising 1,657 ft above sea level.

Putney is bordered by Dummerston to the south, Westminster to the north, and Brookline to the west. The Connecticut River serves as the eastern border of Putney, separating the town from Westmoreland, NH. Putney village is in the southern part of the town, along U.S. Route 5 and Sacketts Brook. Putney is approximately north of Brattleboro and northwest of Keene, New Hampshire.

==Transportation==
U.S. Route 5 and Interstate 91 both pass through Putney, which is accessible from Interstate 91 at Exit 4 on the border of Putney and Dummerston.

The New England Central Railroad has track rights through the town. Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Vermonter&quot; passenger rail line runs through Putney but does not stop in town. The closest stations are Bellows Falls to the north and Brattleboro to the south.

==Demographics==
As of the 2000 census there were 2,634 people, 958 households, and 603 families residing in the town. The population density was 98.3 people per square mile (37.9/km2). There were 1,049 housing units at an average density of 39.1 per square mile (15.1/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 95.63% White, 1.03% African American, 0.49% Native American, 0.76% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 0.30% from other races, and 1.75% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.56% of the population.

There were 958 households, out of which 32.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 50.5% were married couples living together, 8.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 37.0% were non-families. 27.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.43 and the average family size was 2.99.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 22.6% under the age of 18, 16.5% from 18 to 24, 27.5% from 25 to 44, 23.7% from 45 to 64, and 9.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 106.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 108.0 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $40,346, and the median income for a family was $50,170. Males had a median income of $29,922 versus $25,217 for females.

<text>Rockingham is a town along the Connecticut River in Windham County, Vermont, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 4,832. Rockingham includes the incorporated villages of Bellows Falls and Saxtons River, as well as a large rural area west of Interstate 91.

Rockingham has no formal town center; instead, town offices and the Rockingham Public Library are located in the village of Bellows Falls. The approximate center is the Rockingham Meeting House, passed by Route 103, a popular east–west route across the state. The Meeting House was built in Rockingham Village, once the main settlement in the town, but with the increased use of water power for manufacturing, population shifted to other villages located on the two rivers in the town. Most of what was left of Rockingham Village (over a dozen buildings, also called the Old Town) burned in a fire on April 14, 1908; the fire came close to the Meeting House but it was saved. The houses, hotel, and store that burned were not rebuilt.

==History==

One of the New Hampshire grants, it was chartered by Governor Benning Wentworth on December 28, 1752, and named for Lord Rockingham. The township was granted to Samuel Johnson and 72 others. When the Town was first settled in 1753 by pioneers, its rivers were sites of fishing for salmon and shad, as they had been for the original indigenous inhabitants. By 1771, the population reached 225. In 1785, Colonel Enoch Hale erected the first bridge over the Connecticut River, and until 1796, it remained the only bridge across. The village of Bellows Falls became an important mill town, which reduced the runs of palatable fish.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 42.3 square miles (109.6 km2), of which 41.9 square miles (108.5 km2) is land and 0.4 square mile (1.1 km2) (0.97%) is water. It is drained by the Williams and the Saxtons rivers, and several brooks that flow directly into the Connecticut River; the latter river forms the eastern boundary of Rockingham.

The highest point in town is Berry Hill at 478 m/1568 ft elevation, near the northwestern corner of the town. The lowest point is on the Connecticut River at the southern boundary of town, at 73 m/240 ft elevation.

The town is crossed by Interstate 91, U.S. Route 5, Vermont Route 103 and Vermont Route 121. The Bellows Falls train station was once served by three rail lines, and today it has Amtrak service on the &quot;Vermonter&quot; route, with two trains a day, one heading south to Washington, DC and one heading north to St. Albans, VT.

==Demographics==
The rural community, based on farming, had its peak of population in 1920.

<doc id="137440" wikidata="Q7428887" url="?curid=137440" title="Saxtons River, Vermont">
<text>Saxtons River is an incorporated village in the town of Rockingham in Windham County, Vermont, United States. The population was 479 at the 2020 census. For over a hundred years, Saxtons River has been the home of Vermont Academy, an independent secondary school. Most of the village is a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 as Saxtons River Village Historic District.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 0.5 square mile (1.3 km2), all land.

==History==
According to Bellows Falls-based historian Lyman Simpson Hayes, writing in 1907’s &quot;History of the Town of Rockingham&quot;, the first settlement of the area that would become Saxtons River occurred in 1783, when Amos P. Cummings cut down the first trees of an “entirely unbroken wilderness of immense trees of primitive growth.” As late as 1795, there existed only two houses in the village — population growth was extremely slow.

A meeting house was built and the village cemetery established in 1810, and the first textile mill was opened at the Middle Falls (now officially named Saxtons River Falls) in 1815. The village bounds were determined by the town in 1820, and it was formally incorporated as a village in 1905, which is overseen by a board of trustees elected by registered voters of the Village.

By 1828, the village contained the aforementioned meeting house (which by this point was the public school building), a post office, mills of various sorts (grist, saw, fulling), a tannery, a forge, a tavern, a distillery, two stores, one law office and forty-five dwellings. By 1907, Saxtons River was a “flourishing village of about nine hundred and fifty inhabitants, with a variety of mills and other industries.”

From 1900-1924, Rockingham&#x27;s two incorporated villages were linked by the Bellows Falls &amp; Saxtons River Railroad, an electric train system. The company created Barbers Park, east of the Saxtons River about halfway between the villages, to which summertime crowds took the trolleys to baseball games and amusement rides. Although Saxtons River village had a long history of industry, much of it had failed by the 1920s.

Located mostly inside the Village boundaries, and a strong influence on the character and economy of Saxtons River, is Vermont Academy, a private, co-educational high school founded in 1876. Vermont Academy established an annual Winter Carnival early in the 20th century, contributing to the creation of New England&#x27;s winter recreation culture. Student enrollment is around 230.

After a period of decline in the mid-20th century, many of the older buildings, such as the Saxtons River Inn, were restored and rehabilitated.

In 1974, the Campbell family (which at that time represented 1/40th of the population of the village according to the &quot;New York Times&quot; article &quot;21 Campbells and One Charming Vermont Inn&quot;) reopened the aging Saxtons River Inn, &quot;a 1903 relic on Main Street&quot;, full of peeling paint and &quot;hoods of abandoned Cadillacs propped up on the sagging porches.&quot; After a year-long &quot;kind of super barn raising&quot;, with help from the community, the refurbished Inn became a mainstay of the community for decades with a bar, dining room and 10 guest rooms. The Inn has continued to change hands over the years, but still survives.

<text>Townshend is a town in Windham County, Vermont, United States. The town was named for the Townshend family, powerful figures in British politics. The population was 1,291 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The land grant for Townshend was chartered by New Hampshire Governor Benning Wentworth, on June 20, 1753. The town was named after Charles Townshend, the Secretary of War under King George III. Between 1755 and 1761, plans and occupation of Townshend were abandoned due to the impact of the French and Indian War. The grant had required the settlement of the town within five years, so in August 1762, Townshend was regranted under the same stipulations by Governor Wentworth. However, proprietors had already begun meeting again in 1761, and settlement of the town was led by proprietor John Hazeltine in May of that year.

The western boundary of New Hampshire was obscure, and there was controversy over whether the area around Townshend was under jurisdiction of the colony of New Hampshire or New York. In 1764, when King George III officially set the New Hampshire boundary at the western bank of the Connecticut River, proprietors of Townshend and nearby settlers were fearful of being charged twice for the same land. New York authorities only requested documents of confirmation for their latest land, and left the settlers free of charge.

The first farms were treated to fertile soil where they could grow wheat, corn, buckwheat, rye, oats, and barley, but were plagued by tree stumps that were too strongly rooted to be removed by primitive farm machinery. Potatoes, turnips, apples, pumpkins, corn, and maple syrup were other popular harvests. Cattle, sheep, and poultry were common livestock, but hogs were invaluable because of their simple maintenance and abundance of meat upon harvest. Several rivers provided substantial irrigation for farms, and by 1797, two sawmills and one fulling mill had been constructed along the rivers.

At the outbreak of the American Civil War, Townshend had a total population of 1,376, and approximately 120 men fought in the War. Volunteering to fight in the ranks of the Union Army was incentivized by cash bounties, which were set as high as $500 in 1862. Following the same trend that was taking place across Vermont, many Civil War veterans from Townshend left the state after their service. This emigration pattern reflected the desire of former soldiers to explore larger cities around the country, and led to the shrinking of the Vermont population and economy.

==Leland and Gray Union Middle and High School==
Townshend&#x27;s Middle and High School was founded as a private seminary in October 1834, making it one of the oldest Vermont secondary schools. The first building was raised on the east side of the village common, and was named Leland Seminary after Aaron Leland, a Baptist preacher from Chester, Vermont. The school gained the name Leland and Gray when a trustee of the seminary, Deacon Samuel Gray, gifted $800 because the school had been struggling to pay its debts. The two story brick building was destroyed by a fire in 1894, and an octagonal wooden building was immediately constructed as a replacement. As a private school, Leland and Gray Seminary enrolled students from across Vermont and even New England. Over time, several buildings near the school were used as dwelling houses and dormitories for students, and many local families allowed traveling students to live with them.

Leland and Gray Seminary offered a strict curriculum of the basics and classics, and upheld conservative principles of discipline, parental involvement, and dress codes. Hence, the transition to a tuition free public school in 1968 was a dramatic one for the townspeople. Under the new name Leland and Gray Union Middle and High School, the school adopted an open classroom philosophy, in which students could shape their curriculum to their interests and take advantage of a wide variety of electives. This transition divided the families of Townshend between those who preferred the more traditional style of learning, and those who supported the new education system. The resulting tension, which served as a microcosm of the national politics of the time, culminated with the departure of John Newton in 1977, who served as principal for eight years. Construction for the building that now serves as the school began in 1970, and cost nearly $2 million. Leland and Gray has more than 750 alumni.

<text>Wardsboro is a town in Windham County, Vermont, United States. The population was 869 at the 2020 census. The town includes the villages of Wardsboro, Wardsboro Center, West Wardsboro and South Wardsboro.

==History==
The town was settled circa 1779 by Samuel Davis and his wife from Milford, Massachusetts. It was granted and chartered on November 7, 1780, to William Ward of Newfane, for whom the town was named Wardsborough, together with 62 others. In 1788, it was divided into north and south districts, the latter set off and incorporated in 1810 as Dover. Although the terrain is very uneven and in parts rocky, farmers worked the soil into productivity.

Mills were built along the brook, a tributary of the West River. In 1859, industries included three gristmills, six sawmills, one tannery, and a rawhide whip factory. During the Civil War, Wardsborough Center was called Unionville because of its strong Federal sentiment. In the 1880s, Jebediah Estabrook&#x27;s tub, bucket and pail factory at Wardsborough Center was the area&#x27;s principal employer. In 1894, the U.S. Post Office dropped the &quot;ugh&quot; from town names ending in &quot;borough,&quot; so Wardsborough was thereafter known as Wardsboro.

Wardsboro was one of thirteen Vermont towns isolated by flooding caused by Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it was the last of those towns to be released from its isolation.

In April 2016, the Vermont State Legislature voted to make the Gilfeather Turnip the Official Vermont State Vegetable. This unusual hybrid, dating back to the early 1900s, is credited to Farmer John Gilfeather of the Gilfeather Farm in Wardsboro.

==Community Events==
The two largest community events annually are the 4th of July Street Fair and Parade, always held on the 4th of July regardless of what day of the week the holiday falls on, and the Gilfeather Turnip Festival at the end of October.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 29.3 square miles (75.8 km2), all land. It is drained by Wardsboro Brook, a tributary of the West River.

Set in the Green Mountains, much of Wardsboro is included in the Green Mountain National Forest. The town is approximately six miles north of Mount Snow ski area and less than 10 miles south of Stratton ski area. Somerset Reservoir and Grout Pond are only a few minutes away, and the Vermont Association of Snow Travelers Snowmobile trails run through the town.

Wardsboro is crossed by Vermont Route 100.

<text>Cavendish is a town in Windsor County, Vermont, United States. The town was likely named after William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire. The population was 1,392 at the 2020 census. The town of Cavendish includes the unincorporated villages of Cavendish and Proctorsville.

==History==

===Early settlers===
Captain John Coffeen, the town&#x27;s first permanent settler, brought his family and possessions into the wilderness of Cavendish in June 1769. They built a dwelling in the northern part of town on what is now E. I. Heald&#x27;s farm, on the lot still called the &quot;Coffeen pasture&quot;. The Coffeens remained the only family in Cavendish for two years. In the early 1780s, Leonard Proctor and Salmon Dutton came from Massachusetts and gave their names to the two major settlements on the Black River, Proctorsville and Duttonsville. In 1782, the first recorded town meeting occurred and Dutton was elected town clerk. He is credited with having conducted a 1784 survey for the first road from Duttonsville along the Black River to Ludlow (now Vermont routes 103 and 131). In 1786 he became the town&#x27;s first justice of the peace. He also served as moderator of the town meeting, as selectman, and as town treasurer. The marriage of Redfield Proctor and Emily Dutton in 1858 joined the leading families of the two villages and promised to put an end to the former rivalry.

<text>Chester is a town in Windsor County, Vermont, United States. The population was 3,005 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The town was originally chartered by New Hampshire Governor Benning Wentworth as Flamstead in 1754. The terms of the charter were not met and the town was re-chartered as New Flamstead in 1761. In 1766, a patent was issued by New York that changed the name of the town to Chester, after George Augustus Frederick, the Earl of Chester and the eldest son of King George III. Later, the governing authority of Chester reverted to the 1761 charter by an act of the Vermont legislature, although it left the name &quot;Chester&quot; in place. 2011 was thus the 250th anniversary of the town.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.46%, is water.

A prominent geological feature of the town is the Williams River, a tributary of the Connecticut River, whose three branches come together as a central river and run through Chester. Residents use it extensively for recreation; especially fishing and swimming. The banks, covered bridges, waters and nearby homes suffered major damage during Hurricane Irene in 2011. The flooding was caused by Irene&#x27;s rains coupled with the basin having poor drainage in the rugged, hilly land with steep slopes.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2010, 3,154 people resided in Chester, with 1,793 housing units.

<text>Pomfret is a town in Windsor County, Vermont, United States. The population was 916 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The town was named after the Earl of Pomfret. Pomfret was chartered in 1761 by Benning Wentworth, who was the governor of New Hampshire. The first settler (1770) was Bartholomew Durkee, who came from Pomfret, Connecticut. Pomfret was called &quot;New Pomfret&quot; at first because most of the people who settled there came from the town in Connecticut.

One of the earliest ski tows in the United States was established at South Pomfret in 1934, and became known as Suicide Six. Now called Saskadena Six, it has developed into a small ski resort with a moderate-size lodge, a quad chairlift installed in 2017, and large snowmaking capabilities.

In 1976, then-cardinal Karol Wojtyla visited North Pomfret during the summer for a vacation. He later became Pope John Paul II and was canonized a saint.

<text>Royalton is a town in Windsor County, Vermont, United States. The population was 2,750 at the 2020 census. It includes the villages of Royalton, South Royalton, and North Royalton. Vermont Law School, the state&#x27;s only accredited law school, is located in South Royalton.

==History==
The town was chartered on November 23, 1769, by Cadwallader Colden, Royal Lieutenant Governor of New York. The first permanent settlers were Robert Havens and his family, who arrived in 1771. Royalton was re-chartered by the Independent Republic of Vermont on December 20, 1781. The 1780 Royalton Raid was the last major British raid of the American War of Independence in New England. In 1848, the Vermont Central Railroad opened to South Royalton, which developed as a freight depot.

During the Revolutionary War Royalton was visited by Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette

Although Joseph Smith, founder of Mormonism, was born in the adjacent town of Sharon near the Royalton boundary, the Joseph Smith Birthplace Memorial lies in the town.

In June 1974, the now-defunct Royalton College hosted the Institute for Humane Studies&#x27; Conference on Austrian Economics. The conference is considered the &quot;single most important catalyst in this revival of Austrian economics&quot;, an economic theory also known as &quot;The Austrian School&quot;, the &quot;Vienna School&quot; or the &quot;Psychological School&quot;. Edwin G. Dolan hosted the conference. Notable presenters included Israel M. Kirzner, Ludwig M. Lachmann, and Murray N. Rothbard. The edited version of the conference proceedings appears in Professor Dolan&#x27;s &quot;The Foundations of Modern Austrian Economics&quot;.

A landscape photo of Royalton stands in as the fictional town of Stars Hollow in the opening credits of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;.
In the mid-20th-century, Royalton had an economy largely built around lumbering, dairy production, poultry raising, the raising of fresh produce vegetables and maple sugar production.

<text>Sharon is a town in Windsor County, Vermont, United States. It had a population of 1,560 at the 2020 census.

Sharon is the birthplace of Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, and as such is an important historical site for followers of the faith. The town is also home to The Sharon Academy, an independent middle and high school.

==History==
One of the New Hampshire grants, the township was created on August 17, 1761, by a royal charter which King George III of the United Kingdom issued to Governor Benning Wentworth. It was granted to John Taylor and 61 others, many from Sharon, Connecticut. The town was first settled about 1765 by Robert Havens and family. In 1780 during the Revolution, the village was attacked in the Royalton Raid, when a combined British-Mohawk force attacked and burnt the town.

Although the surface of the town is broken, the intervales contain fertile soil, and farming became an important industry. On June 26, 1848, the Vermont Central Railroad opened from White River Junction to Bethel, traversing Sharon and accelerating its development. The White River and its tributaries provided water power for mills. By 1859, when the population reached 1,240, Sharon had 12 sawmills, a gristmill, and a bobbin factory. Many of Sharon&#x27;s most historic homes still line the White River.

In the mid-20th century the main form of employment in Sharon was still the lumber industry.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 40.1 square miles (103.9 km2), of which 39.6 square miles (102.6 km2) is land and 0.5 square mile (1.2 km2) (1.20%) is water. Sharon is drained by the White River and its tributaries.

<text>Weathersfield is a town in Windsor County, Vermont, United States. The population was 2,842 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The town of Weathersfield was named after Wethersfield, Connecticut, the home of some of its earliest settlers. The Connecticut town had taken its name from Wethersfield, a village in the English county of Essex. 

William Jarvis was appointed by President Thomas Jefferson as U.S. Consul General to Portugal after founding a trading house in Lisbon. In 1811, Jarvis imported the first Merino sheep to America from Spain to his farm at Weathersfield Bow. Jarvis set aside eight of the 4,000 Merino sheep he imported as gifts to former President Jefferson and to President James Madison.

&quot;I cannot forbear, Sir,&quot; Jarvis wrote to Jefferson, &quot;making you an offer of a Ram &amp; Ewes, both as a mark of my great esteem &amp; well knowing that the experiment cannot be in better hands.&quot; Jarvis was a wealthy financier and gentleman farmer who had bought up most of the floodplain of Weathersfield. He was also one of the most prominent Republicans in the Connecticut River Valley. Thanks to his introduction of Merino sheep, he provided the underpinning for Vermont agriculture for the next century.

Jarvis married his maternal first cousin, Mary Pepperell Sparhawk of Boston, a fellow descendant of Sir William Pepperrell of Massachusetts. Katherine L. Jarvis, daughter of Hon. William Jarvis, married Harvard-educated lawyer and photographer Col. Leavitt Hunt, brother of architect Richard Morris Hunt and Boston painter William Morris Hunt, and son of Vermont congressman Jonathan Hunt. Leavitt Hunt and his wife later lived in Weathersfield at their home, &quot;Elmsholme&quot;.

Rev. John Dudley, a sometime missionary to the Choctaw Indians, a graduate of Yale Seminary, the descendant of one of the earliest families of Connecticut (his ancestor William Dudley settled in Guilford in the early 17th century) and a widely reprinted Congregational preacher, made his home in Weathersfield, where his son William Wade Dudley was born.

On August 20, 2011, Weathersfield celebrated the 250th anniversary of its town charter.

===Romaine Tenney===
In September 1964, a Weathersfield bachelor farmer named Romaine Tenney burned himself and his farm rather than allow construction of Interstate 91 which was then proceeding through the Connecticut Valley. The state transportation agency had offered landowners compensation, but could also seize land by eminent domain. Many landowners resisted, including one who shot a hole through a surveyor’s hard hat. Tenney happened to be the last local holdout. Finally, he was given an ultimatum to leave. That night a fire ravaged the barn, sheds, and farmhouse. Although Tenney’s body was not identified, it was evident he had nailed his bedroom door shut from the inside. The day after his memorial service, construction on the highway resumed. Tenney was memorialized as the subject of poems, ghost stories, and songs. Tenney’s legacy has become a source of pride for some, despite its horror. It is a display of New England &quot;flint&quot;, a story preserved by the Weathersfield Historical Society. The farm eventually became a park and ride at Exit 8 (Vermont Route 131), where commuters could park their cars and board buses. In March 2020, the last vestige of the farm, a dying rock maple tree was removed. The Vermont Agency of Transportation acknowledged the site’s significance as the Romaine Tenney Memorial Park with a lawn, pavilion, memorial plaque, and picnic table.

The museum houses Civil War memorabilia, a children&#x27;s school room and a library.

== Architecture ==
The architecture of Weathersfield, Vermont, reflects its rich history and the development of the area over the centuries. The town, chartered in 1761, saw modest settlement in the following decade. By the 1790s, the population had grown significantly, leading to the construction of notable buildings.

One of the key architectural highlights is the Weathersfield Center Historic District. This district encompasses a small cluster of historically significant buildings, including the town&#x27;s second church building and the home of its first settled minister. The church, built in 1787 and later destroyed by fire, was replaced by a brick Federal style meeting house in 1821. This meeting house is notable for its restrained late Federal architecture, featuring round-headed door openings, a Palladian window, and a fully pedimented gable with an arched eyebrow window. It also has a multi-stage tower, comprising a square stage with a multilight oculus window, an open octagonal belfry, and a louvered cupola.

Another significant architectural feature in Weathersfield is the Foster House, built in 1825 as a Federal-style two-story house for the town&#x27;s minister. This building, attached to a simpler 1-1/2 story Cape style house, stands on Weathersfield Center Road and is now a historic house museum operated by the local historical society.

Additionally, Weathersfield is home to an early stone animal pound, likely built in the 1780s, which reflects the town&#x27;s agricultural heritage and the practical needs of its early residents.

==Education==

===Primary and Secondary schools===
The Weathersfield School District serves Weathersfield. There is one school in the district, Weathersfield School, located in Ascutney.

<text>Weston is a town in Windsor County, Vermont, United States. The population was 623 at the 2020 census. Home to the Weston Playhouse Theatre Company, it includes the villages of Weston and The Island.

==History==

Weston was originally the western part of Andover called West Town. Because Markham and Terrible Mountain blocked travel between the town&#x27;s halves, it was set off and incorporated on October 26, 1799, by the legislature. Set among the Green Mountains, the terrain is very rough and mountainous, but the intervales provided good soil for agriculture and pasturage. A second village grew at the canal cut to divert the West River to power watermills. Called the Island, it developed into a small mill town.

By 1859, when Weston&#x27;s population was 950, industries included ten sawmills, a gristmill, two tanneries, one wood-turning mill, one machine shop, one axe shop, one carding machine, in addition to shops for blacksmiths, carpenters, tinsmiths, wheelwrights and shoemakers. Vermont&#x27;s oldest professional theatre, the Weston Playhouse Theatre Company, was founded in 1935. The Vermont Country Store, a catalogue, retail, and e-commerce business, was established here in 1946 by Vrest and Ellen Orton.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.57%, is water. The West River flows through the town.

Weston is crossed by Vermont Route 100.

<doc id="137471" wikidata="Q204832" url="?curid=137471" title="Roller coaster">
<text>A roller coaster is a type of amusement ride employing a form of elevated railroad track that carries passengers on a train through tight turns, steep slopes, and other elements usually designed to produce a thrilling experience. Trains consist of open cars connected in a single line, and the rides are often found in theme parks around the world. Roller coasters first appeared in the 17th century, and LaMarcus Adna Thompson obtained one of the first known patents for a roller coaster design in 1885, based on the Switchback Railway which opened a year earlier at Coney Island.

Tracks are typically built and designed as a complete circuit in which trains depart from and return to the same loading station. One variation, a shuttle roller coaster, reverses at some point throughout the course of the ride to traverse the same track backwards.

==History==

===The Russian Mountains and the Aerial Promenades===
The oldest roller coasters are believed to have originated from the so-called &quot;Russian Mountains&quot;; John Collier Jones specially constructed hills of ice located in the area that is now Saint Petersburg, Russia. Built in the 17th century, the slides were built to a height of between , had a 50-degree drop, and were reinforced by wooden supports. Later, in 1784, Catherine the Great is said to have constructed a sledding hill in the gardens of her palace at Oranienbaum in St. Petersburg.
The Riding Mountain (aka &quot;La Grande Glisade&quot;) entertainment pavilion designed by Bartolomeo Francesco Rastrelli for Tsarskoye Selo royal residence was built in 1754–1757. In Russian it was known as &quot;Katalnaya gora&quot; (Катальная гора, literally &quot;Mountain for riding&quot;) It was a huge building in the shape of rotunda. It had a trail with five hills which can be covered with ice in winter. In the summer time the trails used trolleys on wheels secured in the steel grooves mounted on the wooden trails. Due to a pendulum-like motion based on inertia all five hills could be traversed in one ride. The ride was engineered by Russian scientist Andrey Nartov. The Anglican clergyman John Glen King mentioned that some Englishmen visiting Russia called them &quot;Flying Mountains&quot; and described them as follows:

You will observe that there are five mounts of unequal height: the first and the highest is full perpendicular altitude; the momentum with which they descend this carries them over the second, which is about lower, just sufficient to allow for the friction and resistance; and so on to the last, from which they are conveyed by a gentle descent, with nearly same velocity, over a piece of water into a little island. These slides, which are about a furlong and a half (300 m) in length, are made of wood, that may be used in summer as well as in winter. The process is, two of four persons fit in a little carriage and one stands behind, for more there are in it the greater the swiftness with which it goes; it runs on castors and in grooves to keep it on its right direction, and it descends with a wonderful rapidity. Under the hill, is a machine worked by horses for drawing the carriages back again, with the company in them. Such a work as this would have been enormous in most countries for the labour and expense in cost, as well as the vast quantity of wood used in it. At the same place, there is another artificial mount which goes in a spiral line, and in my opinion, for I have tried it also, is very disagreable; as it seems always leaning on one side, and the person feels in danger of falling out of seat.

&quot;Katalnaya gora&quot; was dismantled in 1792–1795. Currently in its place is the Granite Terrace in the Catherine Park.

Two roller-coasters were built in France in 1817. &quot;Les Montagnes de Belleville&quot; (&quot;Les Montagnes Russes à Belleville&quot;) in Belleville, Paris had wheels attached to carriages and locked on tracks.
The &quot;Promenades Aériennes&quot;, opened in Parc Beaujon in Paris on July 8, 1817 had wheeled cars securely locked to the track, guide rails to keep them on course, and higher speeds. It spawned half a dozen imitators, but their popularity soon declined.

However, during the Belle Epoque they returned to fashion. In 1887, Catalan entrepreneur Joseph Oller, co-founder of the Moulin Rouge music hall, constructed the &quot;Montagnes Russes de Belleville&quot;, &quot;Russian Mountains of Belleville&quot; with of track laid out in a double-eight, later enlarged to four figure-eight-shaped loops.
===Scenic railways===
In 1827, a mining company in Summit Hill, Pennsylvania constructed the Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway, a downhill gravity railroad used to deliver coal to Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania – now known as Jim Thorpe. By the 1850s, the &quot;Gravity Road&quot; (as it became known) was selling rides to thrill seekers. Railway companies used similar tracks to provide amusement on days when ridership was low.

Using this idea as a basis, LaMarcus Adna Thompson began work on a gravity Switchback Railway that opened at Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, in 1884. Passengers climbed to the top of a platform and rode a bench-like car down the track up to the top of another tower where the vehicle was switched to a return track and the passengers took the return trip. This track design was soon replaced with an oval complete circuit. In 1885, Phillip Hinkle introduced the first full-circuit coaster with a lift hill, the &quot;Gravity Pleasure Road&quot;, which became the most popular attraction at Coney Island. Not to be outdone, in 1886 Thompson patented his design of roller coaster that included dark tunnels with painted scenery. &quot;Scenic railways&quot; were soon found in amusement parks across the county.

===Popularity, decline, and revival===
By 1919, the first underfriction roller coaster had been developed by John Miller. Over the next decade, roller coasters spread to amusement parks around the world and began an era in the industry often referred to as the &quot;Golden Age&quot;. One of the most well known from the period is the historical &quot;Cyclone&quot; that opened at Coney Island in 1927. The onset of the Great Depression in the 1930s, however, significantly impacted the amusement park industry and brought an end to the rapid growth experienced during the Golden Age. This aside, roller coasters were still built with varying success from location to location. In May 1932, the Scene Railway witnessed somewhat of a revival in the UK, including the opening of the roller coaster at Great Yarmouth. Today it is one of only two scenic railways still in operation in the UK.

In 1959, Disneyland introduced a design breakthrough with &quot;Matterhorn Bobsleds&quot;, the first permanent roller coaster to use a tubular steel track. Designed by Arrow Development, the tubular track was unlike standard rail design on wooden coasters, allowing the track to bend in sharper angles in any direction, leading to the incorporation of loops, corkscrews, and inversion elements into track layouts. A little more than a decade later, the immediate success of &quot;The Racer&quot; at Kings Island in 1972 sparked a new era of roller coaster enthusiasm, which led to a resurgence across the amusement park industry over the next several decades.
==Etymology==

There are several explanations for the name &quot;roller coaster&quot;. It is said to have originated from an early American design where slides or ramps were fitted with rollers over which a sled would coast. This design was abandoned in favor of fitting the wheels to the sled or other vehicles, but the name endured.

Another explanation is that the phrase originated from a ride located in a roller skating rink in Haverhill, Massachusetts in 1887. A toboggan-like sled was raised to the top of a track which consisted of hundreds of rollers. This &quot;Roller Toboggan&quot; then took off down gently rolling hills to the floor. The inventors of this ride, Stephen E. Jackman and Byron B. Floyd, claim that they were the first to use the term &quot;roller coaster&quot;.

The term &quot;jet coaster&quot; is used for roller coasters in Japan, where such amusement park rides are very popular.

In many languages, including most Romance languages, the name refers to &quot;Russian mountains&quot;. Conversely, in Russian, they are called &quot;Американские горки&quot; (&quot;Amerikanskiye gorki&quot;, &quot;American hills&quot;). In the Scandinavian languages, the roller coaster is referred as &quot;mountain-and-valley railway&quot;. German has the word &quot;Achterbahn&quot;, stemming from &quot;Figur-8-Bahn&quot;, relating to the form of the number 8 (&quot;acht&quot; in German). This is similar to the Dutch &quot;Achtbaan&quot;, in which &quot;acht&quot; also means &quot;eight&quot;.

==Mechanics==

Roller coaster trains are not typically powered. Most are pulled up a lift hill by a chain or cable and released downhill. The potential energy accumulated by the rise in height is transferred to kinetic energy, which is then converted back into potential energy as the train rises up the next hill. Changes in elevation become smaller throughout the track&#x27;s course, as some mechanical energy is lost to friction and air drag. A properly-designed, outdoor track will result in a train having enough kinetic energy to complete the entire course under a variety of stressful weather conditions.

Not all coasters feature a lift hill, however. A train may also be set into motion by a launch mechanism such as a flywheel, linear induction motor, linear synchronous motor, hydraulic launch, or drive tire. Some launched roller coasters are capable of reaching greater speeds using less track when compared to traditional coasters that rely on a conventional lift hill.

A brake run at the end of the circuit is the most common method of stopping a roller coaster train as it returns to the station. One notable exception is a powered roller coaster, which instead of relying on gravity uses one or more motors to propel the trains along the course.

In 2006, NASA announced that it would build a system using principles similar to those of a roller coaster to help astronauts escape the Ares I launch pad in an emergency, although this has since been scrapped along with the rest of the Ares program.

==Safety==
Some sources have shown concern over the ability of roller coasters to cause head trauma and serious injury such as the tearing of axons and damaging of blood vessels.

=== Safety mechanisms and technology ===
A variety of safety mechanisms protect riders on roller coasters. One of these is the &quot;block&quot; system. Most large roller coasters have the ability to run two or more trains at once, and the block system prevents these trains from colliding. In this system, the track is divided into two or more sections known as blocks. Only one train is permitted in each block at any given time. There is a section of track at the end of each block where a train can be stopped if necessary, such as preventing dispatch from the station, stopping a lift, or applying brakes. Sensors detect when a train passes so that the system&#x27;s computer is aware of which blocks are occupied. If a train attempts to enter an occupied block, the stopping mechanisms in all blocks are engaged.

Restraints are another critical aspect to roller coaster safety. Roller coasters usually have two different types: Over-the-shoulder-restraints and lap bar restraints. With both, either hydraulic or mechanical safety mechanisms are used within the restraints. Mechanical restraints use a system known as a ratchet and pawl. When riding a roller coaster with a ratchet and pawl system, the sound of clicks can be heard when pulling down the restraint. Hydraulic restraints use a piston and cylinder. Unlike mechanical restraints, there is no feeling of physical or sound of clicks from the restraint being locked in place. Most modern day roller coasters have sensors that are used to make sure each restraint is locked. If all the restraints are locked, it will send a signal to the ride computer letting it know that it is clear for dispatch. If all restraints are not locked, the train will not be able to move out of the station until each restraint is locked.

Braking systems such as pivoting pawls are used on the bottom of the train and on the inclined lift hill. While the cart goes up the lift hill, it is usually pulled by a chain. The pawl moves over bumps that are separated closely apart. In the event that the train ever becomes disconnected from the chain, the anti roll-back system will engage and it will fall back into the nearest downhill stop preventing the train from falling down the lift hill.

Another key to safety is the programmable logic controller, an essential component of a roller coaster&#x27;s computer system. Multiple controllers work together to detect faults associated with operation and automate decisions to engage various elements (e.g. lift, brakes, etc.). Periodic maintenance and visual inspection by ride engineers are also important to verify that structures and materials are within expected wear tolerances and functioning correctly. Effective operating procedures further enhance safety.

=== Roller coaster design and statistics ===
Roller coaster design is another important aspect that requires a working knowledge of basic physics to enhance ride comfort and avoid harmful strain to the rider. Ride designers must carefully analyze the movement a ride subjects its riders to, ensuring it is within a reasonable tolerance. The human body needs sufficient time to react to sudden changes in force in order to control muscle tension and avoid harmful consequences such as whiplash. Designers typically stay in the range of as a maximum for positive g-force acceleration, which increases the feeling of weight and pushes riders downward into their seat. For negative g-force, or the feeling of weightlessness, the target is as a maximum. These fall into a range considered safe to a majority of the population. Lateral acceleration is also typically kept under using various techniques including the banking of curves.

Wheels are a critical part in rollercoaster design. The purpose of wheels is to keep the train on the track and to prevent it from flying off. A majority of roller coaster wheels are made from polyurethane. There are three kinds of roller coaster wheels which include road wheels, side friction wheels, and up-stop wheels. Road wheels ride on top of the track. Side friction wheels ride on the side of the track to keep the train on the track throughout turns. Up-stop wheels ride below the track and prevent the train from lifting off the track.

Roller coasters are statistically very safe when compared to other activities, but despite all the safety measures in place, accidents still occur. The International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) reports that a rider has one chance in 15.5 million of being injured on a ride. Also, &quot;In a typical year, more than 385 million guests enjoyed in excess of 1.7 billion rides at approximately 400 North American fixed-site facilities&quot;. IAAPA is required to report annual ride incidents to the National Safety Council.

==Types==
Roller coasters are divided into two main categories: steel roller coasters and wooden roller coasters. Steel coasters have tubular steel tracks, and compared to wooden coasters, they are typically known for offering a smoother ride and their ability to turn riders upside-down. Wooden coasters have flat steel tracks, and are typically renowned for producing &quot;air time&quot; through the use of negative g-forces when reaching the crest of some hill elements. Newer types of track, such as I-Box and Topper introduced by Rocky Mountain Construction (RMC), improve the ride experience on wooden coasters, lower maintenance costs, and add the ability to invert riders.
A third classification type is often referred to as a hybrid roller coaster, which use a mixture of wood and steel elements for the track and structure. Many, for example, have a track made out of steel and a support structure made from wood. RMC has notably redesigned wood coasters that have either deteriorated from age or been deemed by parks as too costly to maintain. RMC often replaces the wood track with their patented steel I-Box track design, while reusing much of the ride&#x27;s wooden structure, resulting in a smoother ride with the incorporation of new design elements, such as inversions, sharper turns, and steeper drops.

Although the term wasn&#x27;t widely used or accepted until the 21st century, one of the oldest examples is Cyclone at Luna Park, which opened in 1927. It features a wood track and steel structure. Other older examples include mine train roller coasters, many of which were built by Arrow Dynamics. The term &quot;hybrid&quot; became more prominent after the introduction of New Texas Giant at Six Flags Over Texas in 2011. Many in the industry, however, continue to classify coasters strictly by their track type only, labeling them either steel or wood.

Modern roller coasters are constantly evolving to provide a variety of different experiences. More focus is being placed on the position of riders in relation to the overall experience. Traditionally, riders sit facing forward, but newer variations such as stand-up and flying models position the rider in different ways to change the experiences. A flying model, for example, places riders lying down and facing forward with their chests and feet strapped in. Other ways of enhancing the experience involve removing the floor beneath passengers riding above the track, as featured in floorless roller coasters. Unique track elements, such as new inversions, are often introduced to provide entirely new experiences.

===By height===

Several height classifications have been used by parks and manufacturers in marketing their roller coasters, as well as enthusiasts within the industry. One classification, the kiddie coaster, is a roller coaster specifically designed for younger riders. Following World War II, parks began pushing for more of them to be built in contrast to the height and age restrictions of standard designs at the time. Companies like Philadelphia Toboggan Company (PTC) developed scaled-down versions of their larger models to accommodate the demand. These typically featured lift hills smaller than , and still do today. The rise of kiddie coasters soon led to the development of &quot;junior&quot; models that had lift hills up to . A notable example of a junior coaster is the Sea Dragon – the oldest operating roller coaster from PTC&#x27;s legendary designer John Allen – which opened at Wyandot Lake in 1956 near Powell, Ohio.

====Hypercoaster====

A hypercoaster, occasionally stylized as hyper coaster, is a type of roller coaster with a height or drop of at least . Moonsault Scramble, which debuted at Fuji-Q Highland in 1984, was the first to break this barrier, though the term &quot;hypercoaster&quot; was first coined by Cedar Point and Arrow Dynamics with the opening of Magnum XL-200 in 1989. Hypercoasters have become one of the most predominant types of roller coasters in the world, now led by manufacturers Bolliger &amp; Mabillard and Intamin.

====Giga coaster====
A giga coaster is a type of roller coaster with a height or drop of at least . The term was coined during the construction of the Millennium Force, a roller coaster built by Intamin on Cedar Point amusement park. Although Morgan and Bolliger &amp; Mabillard have not used the term &quot;giga&quot;, both have also produced roller coasters in this class.

====Strata coaster====
A strata coaster is a type of roller coaster with a height or drop of at least . As with the other two height classifications, the term &quot;strata&quot; was first introduced by Cedar Point with the release of Top Thrill Dragster, a roller coaster that opened in 2003. Kingda Ka was the second strata coaster, and it opened at Six Flags Great Adventure in 2005 as the tallest roller coaster in the world with a height of . Top Thrill Dragster closed in 2021 following an incident in which a guest was severely injured while standing in line The ride was subsequently refurbished and modified, and it reopened in 2024 as Top Thrill 2. Kingda Ka closed on November 10, 2024.

, a coaster, opened in 1997 at Six Flags Magic Mountain. It is not typically classified as a strata coaster due to its shuttle coaster design, where trains do not travel a complete circuit.

====Exa coaster====
An exa coaster is a type of roller coaster with a height or drop of at least . The term &quot;exa&quot; was first introduced by Intamin for Falcons Flight, a coaster expected to open at Six Flags Qiddiya in 2025. Upon completion, it will be the tallest roller coaster in the world, surpassing the previous record once held by the now-defunct Kingda Ka.

<text>White River Junction is an unincorporated village and census-designated place (CDP) in the town of Hartford in Windsor County, Vermont, United States. The population was 2,528 at the 2020 census, up from 2,286 in 2010, making it the largest community within the town of Hartford.

The village includes the White River Junction Historic District, a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 and whose boundaries increased in 2002. The historic district reflects the urban architecture of the area from the late 19th century and early 20th century. The district is bounded by the Central Vermont railroad tracks, Gates Street, and South Main Street. It includes at least 29 contributing and non-contributing buildings. Notable buildings include the Coolidge Hotel, the First National Bank building, a U.S. Post Office building, and the White River Junction Fire House, showing examples of Greek Revival, Colonial Revival, Richardsonian Romanesque, Italianate, and Romanesque architecture.

==History==
The village has long had a role in transportation, primarily as a railroad junction. From the arrival of the first railroads in the late 1840s until rail diminished in importance in the 1950s and 1960s, White River Junction was the most important railroad community in Vermont. Its original importance was due to its location at the confluence of the White River with the Connecticut River. In 1803 Elias Lyman built a bridge across the Connecticut from the north bank of the White River to West Lebanon, New Hampshire.

The local population remained quite low until the arrival of the railroad in the 1840s. Five different railroad lines were laid through the village site between 1847 and 1863 (the Vermont Central Railway and Connecticut River Railroad in 1847, the Connecticut and Passumpsic Rivers Railroad in 1848, the Northern New Hampshire Railroad in 1849, and the Woodstock Railroad in 1863), creating an eight-track crossing that was served by 50 passenger trains daily. In 1849, the village&#x27;s first railroad depot was built, and local farmer Samuel Nutt arranged to buy and dismantle a hotel in Enfield, New Hampshire, and move it to his farm on the other side of the railroad tracks from the depot. His hotel, named the Junction House, was the first of three hotels to occupy the site, which now is home to the Coolidge Hotel, built in 1924.

White River Junction hosted the annual Vermont State Fair from the mid-19th century until the mid-20th century. A special rail spur carried visitors uphill from the station to the fairgrounds.

It takes its name from the White River, which joins with the Connecticut River there.

==Culture==

White River Junction served as the location for the filming of director D.W. Griffith&#x27;s film &quot;Way Down East&quot;, in part filmed on the ice floes of the Connecticut and White rivers, starring Lillian Gish and Richard Barthelmess. While filming, both cast and crew lodged at the Hotel Coolidge (then the Junction House). After 1950, important murals were painted on the walls of this hotel by Peter Gish. One of these, saying simply &quot;ROOM WITH BATH&quot; and a large arrow, has become a bit of a landmark. S. Douglas Crockwell painted a mural, &quot;Vermont Industries&quot;, in the post office in 1937. Federally commissioned murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department.

Hotel Coolidge, renovated in 1997, now operates as a 30-room hotel and a 26-bed youth hostel by Hostelling International USA. The 1920s structure once served as a railway hotel. The hotel is said to be haunted by the ghost of Ezra &quot;Wrench&quot; Magoon, a farmer and known bootlegger who died in the Hotel Coolidge in the summer of 1918.

White River Junction is home to the Center for Cartoon Studies, a 2-year art school focusing on sequential art.

It is also home to the Tip Top Building, a renovated bakery that houses artists, creative businesses and a cafe.

The Main Street Museum, described by the &quot;Washington Post&quot; as a &quot;blastfighter,&quot; is an eclectic display space for material culture and an experiment in a new taxonomy. It makes its home in White River Junction&#x27;s former fire station on Bridge Street, next to the underpass.

White River Junction is home to Northern Stage, a professional regional theatre. It is also home to The Writers&#x27; Center, which offers classes and workshops to the local writing community.

<text>Maximus the Confessor (), also spelled Maximos, otherwise known as Maximus the Theologian and Maximus of Constantinople ( – 13 August 662), was a Christian monk, theologian, and scholar.

In his early life, Maximus was a civil servant, and an aide to the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius. He gave up this life in the political sphere to enter the monastic life. Maximus had studied diverse schools of philosophy, and certainly what was common for his time, the Platonic dialogues, the works of Aristotle, and numerous later Platonic commentators on Aristotle and Plato, like Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Proclus. When one of his friends began espousing the Christological position known as Monothelitism, Maximus was drawn into the controversy, in which he supported an interpretation of the Chalcedonian formula on the basis of which it was asserted that Jesus had both a human and a divine will. Maximus is venerated in both the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches. He was eventually persecuted for his Christological positions; following a trial, his tongue and right hand were mutilated.

He was then exiled and died on 13 August 662, in Tsageri in present-day Georgia. However, his theology was upheld by the Third Council of Constantinople and he was venerated as a saint soon after his death. His title of &quot;Confessor&quot; means that he suffered for the Christian faith, but was not directly martyred. His feast day is 13 August in the Western Church and 21 January in the Byzantine Christianity.

==Life==

===Early life===
Very little is known about the details of Maximus&#x27; life prior to his involvement in the theological and political conflicts of the Monothelite controversy. Numerous Maximian scholars call substantial portions of the Maronite biography into question, including Maximus&#x27; birth in Palestine, which was a common seventh century trope to discredit an opponent. Moreover, the exceptional education Maximus evidently received could not have been had in any other part of the Byzantine Empire during that time except for Constantinople, and possibly Caesarea and Alexandria. It is also very unlikely that anyone of low social birth, as the Maronite biography describes Maximus, could have ascended by the age of thirty to be the Protoasekretis of the Emperor Heraclius, one of the most powerful positions in the Empire. It is more likely that Maximus was born of an aristocratic family and received an unparalleled education in philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, etc. It is true, however, that Maximus did not study rhetoric as he himself notes in the prologue to his Earlier Ambigua to John, to which his lack of high stylistic by Byzantine standards attests. Nevertheless, for reasons not explained in the few autobiographical details to be gleaned from his texts, Maximus left public life and took monastic vows at the monastery of Philippicus in Chrysopolis, a city across the Bosporus from Constantinople. Maximus was elevated to the position of abbot of the monastery.

When the Persians conquered Anatolia, Maximus was forced to flee to a monastery near Carthage. It was there that he came under the tutelage of Saint Sophronius, and began studying in detail with him the Christological writings of Gregory of Nazianzus and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. According to I P Sheldon Williams his achievement was to set these doctrines into a framework of Aristotelian logic, which both suited the temper of the times and made them less liable to misinterpretation. Maximus continued his career as a theological and spiritual writer during his lengthy stay in Carthage. Maximus was also held in high esteem by the exarch Gregory and the eparch George.

===Involvement in Monothelite controversy===

While Maximus was in Carthage, a controversy broke out regarding how to understand the interaction between the human and divine natures within the person of Jesus. This Christological debate was the latest development in disagreements that began following the First Council of Nicaea in 325, and were intensified following the Council of Chalcedon in 451. The Monothelite position was developed as a compromise between the dyophysitists and the miaphysists, who believed dyophysitism is conceptually indistinguishable from Nestorianism. The Monothelites adhered to the Chalcedonian definition of the hypostatic union: that two natures, one divine and one human, were united in the person of Christ. However, they went on to say that Christ had only a divine will and no human will (Monothelite is derived from the Greek for &quot;one will&quot;).

The Monothelite position was promulgated by Patriarch Sergius I of Constantinople and by Maximus&#x27; friend and successor as the Abbot of Chrysopolis, Pyrrhus. Following the death of Sergius in 638, Pyrrhus succeeded him as Patriarch, but was shortly deposed owing to political circumstances. During Pyrrhus&#x27; exile from Constantinople, Maximus and the deposed Patriarch held a public debate on the issue of Monothelitism. In the debate, which was held in the presence of many North African bishops, Maximus took the position that Jesus possessed both a human and a divine will. The result of the debate was that Pyrrhus admitted the error of the Monothelite position, and Maximus accompanied him to Rome in 645.

Maximus may have remained in Rome at San Saba, as he was present when the newly elected Pope Martin I convened the Lateran Council of 649 at the Lateran Basilica in Rome. The 105 bishops present condemned Monothelitism in the official acts of the synod, which some believe may have been written by Maximus. It was in Rome that Pope Martin and Maximus were arrested in 653 under orders from Constans II, who supported the Monothelite doctrine. Pope Martin was condemned without a trial, and died before he could be sent to the Imperial Capital.

===Trial and exile===
Maximus&#x27; refusal to accept Monothelitism caused him to be brought to the imperial capital of Constantinople to be tried as a heretic in 658. In Constantinople, Monothelitism had gained the favor of both the Emperor and the Patriarch of Constantinople. Maximus stood behind the Dyothelite position and was sent back into exile for four more years. During his trial he was accused of aiding the Muslim conquests in Egypt and North Africa, which he rejected as slander.

In 662, Maximus was placed on trial once more, and was once more convicted of heresy. Following the trial Maximus was tortured, having his tongue cut out, so he could no longer speak his rebellion, and his right hand cut off, so that he could no longer write letters. Maximus was then exiled to the Lazica or Colchis region of modern-day Georgia and was cast in the fortress of Schemarum, perhaps Muris-Tsikhe near the modern town of Tsageri. He died soon thereafter, on 13 August 662. The events of the trials of Maximus were recorded by Anastasius Bibliothecarius.

==Legacy==

Along with Pope Martin I, Maximus was vindicated by the Third Council of Constantinople (the Sixth Ecumenical Council, 680–681), which declared that Christ possessed both a human and a divine will. With this declaration Monothelitism became heresy, and Maximus was posthumously declared innocent.

Maximus is among those Christians who were venerated as saints shortly after their deaths. The vindication of Maximus&#x27; theological position made him extremely popular within a generation after his death, and his cause was aided by the accounts of miracles at his tomb.

Maximus is one of the last men to be recognized by both the Orthodox and Catholic Churches as a Father of the Church. In the encyclical &quot;Spe Salvi&quot; (2007), Pope Benedict XVI called Maximus &#x27;the great Greek doctor of the Church&#x27;, although it is not clear if the Pontiff intended to nominate Maximus &#x27;Doctor of the Church&#x27; or to say that he already was one.

==Theology==
As a student of Pseudo-Dionysius, Maximus was one of many Christian theologians who preserved and interpreted the earlier Neo-Platonic philosophy, including the thought of such figures as Plotinus and Proclus. Maximus&#x27; work on Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite was continued by John Scotus Eriugena at the request of Charles the Bald.

The Platonic influence on Maximus&#x27; thought can be seen most clearly in his theological anthropology. Here, Maximus adopted the Platonic model of exitus-reditus (exit and return), teaching that humanity was made in the image of God, and the purpose of salvation is to restore us to unity with God. This emphasis on divinization or &quot;theosis&quot; helped secure Maximus&#x27; place in Eastern theology, as these concepts have always held an important place in Eastern Christianity.

Christologically Maximus insisted on a strict dyophysitism, which can be seen as a corollary of the emphasis on &quot;theosis&quot;. In terms of salvation, humanity is intended to be fully united with God. This is possible for Maximus because God was first fully united with humanity in the incarnation. If Christ did not become fully human (if, for example, he only had a divine and not a human will), then salvation was no longer possible, as humanity could not become fully divine. Furthermore, in his works Maximus the Confessor argued the unconditionality of the divine incarnation.

Regarding salvation, Maximus, like Origen and St. Gregory of Nyssa, has been described as a proponent of &quot;apocatastasis&quot; or universal reconciliation, the idea that all rational souls will eventually be redeemed. While this claim has been disputed, others have argued that Maximus shared this belief in universal reconciliation with his most spiritually mature students.

==Reception==
In Eastern Christianity, Maximus has always been influential. A number of his works are included in the Greek &quot;Philokalia&quot;, a collection of some of the most influential Eastern Orthodox Christian writers.

Attributed texts
* &quot;Scholia&quot; – commentary on the earlier writings of Pseudo-Dionysius. The original edition in Latin of Balthasar Corderius (Antwerp 1634) attributes all of the Scholia to Maximus, but the authorship has been questioned with Hans Urs von Balthasar (1940, 1961) attributing some of the Scholia to John of Scythopolis.
* &quot;Life of the Virgin&quot; – earliest complete biography of Mary, the mother of Jesus. This is an attributed work and now believed not to be by Maximus the Confessor. Jankowiak and Booth argue that &quot;none of Maximus&#x27; characteristic preoccupations appear in the &quot;Life&quot;, and in turn none of the &quot;Life&#x27; &quot;s central themes appear in the fleeting Marian reflections contained within his genuine corpus&quot;. They also write that there is no Greek manuscript witnessing the text, no evidence that any key thinkers who draw on Maximus were aware of the &quot;Life&#x27; &quot;s existence and that no record of the &quot;Life&quot; as a work exists prior to the second half of the tenth century.

<text>Wilder is an unincorporated village and census-designated place (CDP) within the town of Hartford in Windsor County, Vermont, United States. It is the location of the Wilder Dam on the Connecticut River. The population of the CDP was 1,690 at the 2010 census. The village center is an early example of a planned mill community, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Wilder Village Historic District in 1999.

==History==
The village, originally known as Olcott Falls, is unique as an early planned community developed in part by Charles Wilder, owner of a local paper mill in the 1880s. One feature of Wilder&#x27;s plan was an orderly street plan in which streets were laid out at right angles, with several of the streets named after trees. The village was renamed in honor of Charles Wilder in 1897.

As of the earliest years of the 20th century, the local paper mill was operated by International Paper and Wilder boasted a railroad station, a post office, several retail stores, and electric street lighting. An iron bridge contributed by Charles Wilder spanned the Connecticut River at Wilder. The bridge, the paper mill, and the dam that supplied power to the mill were all demolished in 1950 for the construction of Wilder Dam.

The Wilder Village Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. The district covers and contains 203 contributing resources. It includes examples of Queen Anne and Colonial Revival style architecture with houses dating from the late 19th century to the 1950s. It encompasses the main surviving portions of Wilder&#x27;s planned community, and is roughly bounded on the north by Chestnut Street, the east by Passumpsic Avenue, the south by Horseshoe Avenue, and the west by Hartford Avenue (United States Route 5). This area is largely residential, with only a few commercial buildings and the local public library among the exceptions.

<text>Windsor is a town in Windsor County, Vermont, United States. As the &quot;Birthplace of Vermont&quot;, the town is where the Constitution of Vermont was adopted in 1777, thus marking the founding of the Vermont Republic, a sovereign state until 1791, when Vermont joined the United States. Over much of its history, Windsor was home to a variety of manufacturing enterprises. Its population was 3,559 at the 2020 census.

==History==

One of the New Hampshire grants, Windsor was chartered as a town on July 6, 1761, by colonial governor Benning Wentworth. It was first settled in August 1764 by Captain Steele Smith and his family from Farmington, Connecticut. In 1777, the signers of the Constitution of the Vermont Republic met at Old Constitution House, a tavern at the time, to declare independence from the Great Britain (the Vermont Republic would not become a state until 1791). In 1820, it was the state&#x27;s largest town, a thriving center for trade and agriculture. In 1835, the first dam was built across Mill Brook to provide water power. Factories made guns, machinery, tinware, furniture and harnesses. The community is named for Windsor, Connecticut.

In 1846, Robbins and Lawrence received a government contract to manufacture firearms. Using advanced machine tools to produce interchangeable parts, they and their associates established factories in the Connecticut River valley and throughout New England. Two factories, now both closed, sustained the economy of Windsor: Cone Automatic Machine Company and a Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company plant.

Windsor village began development at the end of the 18th century and achieved importance in Vermont history as the location of the framing of the constitution of Vermont. It is known as the birthplace of Vermont, where the state constitution was signed, and acted as the first capital until 1805 when Montpelier became the official state capital.

Commerce prospered due to the village&#x27;s location on the banks of the Connecticut River where several smaller streams run into it. The economy improved in the mid-19th century when Windsor became the first town in the state to break ground for the railroad with the construction of a rail depot. Windsor Station connected the town to out-of-state markets. It was after the railroad went through that the area was discovered by tourists.

Windsor&#x27;s war memorial, the City Center Veterans Memorial, was created by sculptor Lawrence Nowlan.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 19.8 square miles (51.2 km2), of which 19.5 square miles (50.6 km2) is land and 0.2 square mile (0.5 km2) (1.06%) is water. Home to part of Mount Ascutney, Windsor is situated beside the Connecticut River.

The town is crossed by Interstate 91, U.S. Route 5, Vermont Route 12, Vermont Route 44, and Vermont Route 44A. It is bordered by the town of Weathersfield to the south, West Windsor to the west, and Hartland to the north. To the east, across the Connecticut River, is Cornish, New Hampshire, to which Windsor is connected by the Cornish–Windsor Covered Bridge, one of the longest covered bridges in the world.

<text>Accomac is a town in and the county seat of Accomack County, Virginia, United States. The population was 526 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Though Accomack County was established as one of Virginia&#x27;s eight original shires in 1634, the government was situated in the southern part of the Eastern Shore near Eastville until the division of the shore into two counties (Northampton and Accomack) in 1663. During this era, religious diversity began in the area, as Presbyterian Francis Makemie received a plantation nearby which he used as a base for his mercantile and missionary journeys, and where he died at age 50 a few years after winning a New York court case brought against his preaching (as the Scots-Irish emigrant to Maryland&#x27;s Eastern Shore counties produced a preaching license from Barbados). Early Baptist Elijah Baker also arrived near Accomac before the American Revolutionary War, and was likewise imprisoned for unauthorized preaching, but eventually also had that case dismissed.

After the creation of the present-day Accomack County, the court convened alternatively at Pungoteague and Onancock until the 1690s when it shifted to the house of John Cole at the site that later became the town of Accomac, then known by the name Matompkin. A brick courthouse was built in 1756 and the surrounding settlement became known as Accomack Courthouse. On December 7, 1786, Richard Drummond, Gilbert Poiley, John McLean, Edward Kerr, Catherine Scott, Patience Robertson, and William Berkeley petitioned the Virginia House of Delegates for the creation of an incorporated town at Accomack Courthouse. Their petition was granted and the House of Delegates passed an &quot;Act to establish a Town at the Courthouse of the county of Accomack...by the name of Drummond,&quot; named in honor of the chief landholder in the new town. Many of the town&#x27;s historic houses, churches, and other buildings were constructed between the last decade of the eighteenth century and first half of the nineteenth century, representing vernacular interpretations of late Georgian, Federal, and Greek Revival architectural styles, as the town prospered as the terminus of a ferry across Chesapeake Bay. The modern ferry only travels between nearby Onancock, Virginia and Tangier Island.

During the American Civil War, the Union Army occupied the Eastern Shore to cut supply lines to the south and prevent the Confederate Army from using the shore as a staging area to attack the north through Maryland. Union General Henry H. Lockwood commanded the occupying forces and established a headquarters in the rectory of St. James Episcopal Church (then home to town physician Dr. Peter F. Browne). Other than damages to the Presbyterian and Methodist Churches which were used by the army for stables and housing, Drummondtown escaped the war with little damage.

The late nineteenth century brought slow but steady economic prosperity for the citizens of Drummondtown, fueled by the arrival of the railroad from the north, and several new homes were constructed in and around the older core of the town in the 1880s and 1890s. The coming of the railroad also presented a challenge for Drummondtown when residents of the newly established town of Parksley initiated a referendum to move the county seat to the new community. The referendum vote took place in 1895 after nearly a decade of debate, and the residents of Accomack County elected to keep the court where it had been located for the past two centuries. By this time, the town had been renamed &quot;Accomac&quot; by order of the United States Post Office Department dated August 9, 1893. The name &quot;Accomac&quot; is derived from a Native American word translated to mean &quot;on the other side&quot;.

<doc id="137478" wikidata="Q1073686" url="?curid=137478" title="Chincoteague, Virginia">
<text>Chincoteague ( or ) is a town in Accomack County, Virginia, U.S. The town includes the whole of Chincoteague Island and an area of adjacent water. The population was 3,344 at the 2020 census. The town is a tourist gateway to the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge on adjacent Assateague Island, the location of a popular recreational beach and home of the Virginia herd of Chincoteague Ponies. These ponies and the annual Pony Swim are the subject of Marguerite Henry&#x27;s 1947 children&#x27;s book &quot;Misty of Chincoteague&quot;, which was made into the 1961 family film &quot;Misty&quot;, filmed on location.

==Geography==
Chincoteague is located at (37.934673, −75.367805). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 75.58%, is water. It lies at an elevation of three feet.

==History==

Chincoteague was a barrier island until the mid-1800s, when Assateague migrated so far south that it shielded Chincoteague from the ocean. The year of 1650 marks the first land grant issued on Chincoteague Island, for . Daniel Jenifer became the first English landowner. In 1671, settlers came to the island, and by 1672 there were large farms by Bishops, Bowdens, Jesters and Tarrs. By 1838, there were 36 houses on the island. In 1861, with the Civil War looming following the attack on Fort Sumter, the island voted 132–2 not to secede from the Union and against slavery. The town saw minor action in the war via the Battle of Cockle Creek, which was fought in the bay in 1861.

The Native American name for the island is &quot;Gingoteague&quot;, and the name of the town &quot;Chincoteague&quot; first appeared in the &quot;Decisions of the United States Board on Geographic Names&quot; in 1943.

In 1962, a major nor&#x27;easter winter storm, the Ash Wednesday Storm, struck the coast. The town was completely underwater, and went for days without electricity. The storm destroyed almost all structures on Assateague Island, where development was just beginning. Following this, most of the island was preserved from development as Assateague Island National Seashore in 1965.

The Assateague Lighthouse and Captain Timothy Hill House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In March 2020, the town received critical flood protection funding ($53.9 million). 

===Chincoteague ponies===

Legend has it that the feral ponies on Assateague are descendants of survivors of a Spanish galleon that sank on its way to Spain during a storm in 1750 off the east coast, but the likelihood is that they are actually descended from domesticated stock, brought to the island by Eastern Shore farmers in the 17th century to avoid fencing requirements and taxation.

In the Pony Penning, which has been held annually since 1925, horses swim across the shallow water between the islands. At &quot;slack tide&quot; on the Wednesday before the last Thursday of every July, Chincoteague&#x27;s &quot;Saltwater Cowboys&quot; herd the wild Chincoteague ponies from Assateague Island, across the Assateague Channel, to neighboring Chincoteague Island. If any animal is too small or weak to make the swim, it is placed on a barge and ferried over. All the horses are herded into large pens after running through the middle of town and down Main Street. Pony Penning takes place on the last consecutive Wednesday and Thursday in July. The actual swim occurs on Wednesday, the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company auctions that year&#x27;s foals on Thursday, and on Friday the remaining ponies swim back to Assateague.

==Tourism==

The town features numerous small hotels, bed and breakfasts, and campgrounds that serve visitors to the region, such as those patronizing the beaches. The island also features many restaurants, miniature golf courses and ice cream parlors, including Island Creamery. The island contains two museums: Beebe Ranch, and the Museum of Chincoteague Island. With the designation of the nearby Wallops Flight Facility as the launch site for the Antares rocket and Cygnus cargo module used to resupply the International Space Station, there are large influxes of tourists whenever an Antares launch occurs.

<text>Onancock ( ) is a town in Accomack County, Virginia, United States. The population was 1,263 at the 2010 census.

==History==
According to a nearby Virginia state highway marker, Onancock was founded in 1680. A courthouse was established some years after, and militia barracks established during the Revolution.

Some thirteen months after Cornwallis&#x27; October 1781 surrender at Yorktown, Commodore Zedechiah Whaley sought aid from Onancock during a naval campaign against British barges of war that had been harassing the shores and farms of Chesapeake Bay. On November 28, 1782, he sailed up Onancock Creek and appealed to Lt. Colonel John Cropper, who rounded up 25 local men in support. They boarded Whaley&#x27;s flagship, &quot;Protector&quot;, and continued his siege upon the British flotilla.

In what became the Battle of Kedges Strait three out of four of Whaley&#x27;s barges turned back under heavy British fire, leaving the &quot;Protector&quot; alone to press on with the fight. Vastly outnumbered, ultimately 25 of its 65 men were killed or wounded, 29 captured, and only 11 escaped during a climactic action on November 30. Whaley surrendered—in the last naval action of the Revolution—on the very day the Treaty of Paris seeking to finally end the hostilities between the two nations was drafted. It would be another year and a half yet until the completed treaty was signed, ratified, and exchanged, ultimately becoming effective on May 12, 1784.

The highway marker also indicates that the home of Virginia governor Henry A. Wise (1856–60), Onley, is nearby.

In the mid-19th century, Onancock was a point along the stagecoach route between Wilmington, Delaware and Eastville, Virginia.

The Onancock Historic District, Cokesbury Church, Hopkins and Brother Store, and Ker Place are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Painter is a town in Accomack County, Virginia, United States. The population was recorded at 229 at the 2010 census.

==History==

From its earliest settlement, most villages and towns on the Eastern Shore of Virginia were located near the coasts at navigable ports where crops or livestock could be transported by boat. The coming of the New York, Pennsylvania, and Norfolk Railroad in the 1880s initiated a shift in population and commerce to the center of the shore and created the need for new towns, including the town of Painter.

The Painter-Garrisons United Methodist Church was established in nearby Mappsburg, Virginia in 1784 when Bishop Francis Asbury made his first of six visits to the home of Jonathan Garrison. The congregation constructed a chapel by 1787, the first house of worship to be built by the Methodist Episcopal Church on the Eastern Shore. The present church was erected in 1855 and was the scene of the establishment of the Independent Convention of Accomack, a group of Methodist Churches that left the northern church in 1860 and, at the close of the war, joined the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. By the turn of the 20th century, as the population continued to shift from Mappsburg to Painter and other new towns, the church erected a second building in Painter in 1906. Twenty years later, the older church was moved to Painter and adjoined to the existing building at which time it took the name Painter-Garrisons Church. The 1855 building is today the second-oldest Methodist Church building on the Eastern Shore.

Willowdale and Central High School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== History ==

The history of Parksley is directly tied to the arrival of the New York, Philadelphia, and Norfolk [NYP&amp;N] Railroad on Virginia&#x27;s Eastern Shore in the mid-1880s. When the rail line connecting the lower Delmarva Peninsula to the markets of the northeast was built in 1884, several new towns were created along its route which bypassed many of the shore&#x27;s older established communities. Parksley was the second such planned town on the Virginia shore (after Cape Charles at the railroad&#x27;s southern terminus in Northampton County) and was laid out in 1885 under the management of the Parksley Land Improvement Company. In 1898, town leaders made an unsuccessful attempt to relocate the county seat from Accomac to the Parksley. The town was incorporated in 1904. During the first half of the 20th century, Parksley became an important shipping point for seafood and agricultural products harvested from the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean in Accomack County. During World War II, Parksley was the site of the Shore National Guard Armory and its airfield was utilized by the Civil Air Patrol, part of military reconnaissance activities guarding the east coast of the United States against possible German invasion. Parksley was home to the Parksley Spuds, a team which played in the Eastern Shore Baseball League.

As of 2021, Parksley has had most of its historic train tracks removed. The removal was approved by the company Canonie Atlantic Co., despite the protests of some locals and New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk Railroad. The removal was approved; the only remaining train tracks in Parksley are associated with the Eastern Shore Railway Museum.

==Economy==
The local economy of Parksley is dominated by the agriculture industry; both Perdue Farms and Tyson Foods operate large chicken processing facilities in Parksley.

<doc id="137487" wikidata="Q1376985" url="?curid=137487" title="Saxis, Virginia">
<text>Saxis is a town in Accomack County, Virginia, United States. The population was 241 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Saxis Island juts into Pocomoke Sound and is separated from the rest of Accomack County by Freeschool Marsh. The community that exists on the island began as a single farmstead. The community grew in size throughout the 1800s and was incorporated in 1959.

From as early as 8,000 BCE through the period of European contact in the seventeenth century, prehistoric populations periodically visited Saxis Island, probably to procure plants, shellfish, and game from its rich marine and marsh environments. The earliest documentary related to Saxis occurs on Capt. John Smith&#x27;s map of the Chesapeake Bay region and in his published description of an exploratory voyage in the summer of 1608. During a foray up the Pocomoke Sound, Smith and his party encountered a village inhabited by the Pocomoke Indians along the south shore of the sound. By the 1630s, though, fur traders based in Maryland and rival Virginia traders on Kent Island were active all along the bay side of the Eastern Shore. Due to its isolation—separated from the Eastern Shore mainland by maritime tidal marsh and bounded by water on the north, south, and west—the peninsula has been known as Saxis Island since European settlers and speculators claimed land there beginning in 1661. When land was first patented by European settlers in 1666, Saxis Island was divided into two sections; the north end, the 150-acre property of Robert Sikes was known as “Sikes’s Island,” and the remaining 200-acre parcel to the south was owned by George Parker who called his land “St. George’s Island.” The division is still partly visible by a drainage ditch along Saxis Road.

By 1860, the population had risen to 169 residents, including 15 free blacks. Early in the Civil War, Pocomoke Sound became a center of smuggling supplies for Confederates through a Union blockade of the Chesapeake Bay. Marking the line between the Union (Maryland) and Confederacy (Virginia), smugglers could easily cross from one zone to another without detection. In response, a Union naval flotilla was sent to patrol the local waters and interrupt smuggling operations. On November 16, 1861, the Union Army quickly marched south from the Maryland line and occupied the Eastern Shore of Virginia unopposed. At the same time shore parties from three Union ships came ashore on Saxis to obtain supplies. After the Union gained control of the Eastern Shore, local tradition holds, at least two vessels from Saxis engaged in blockade running, carrying supplies to Confederate troops in Virginia on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay. Besides the unconfirmed oral tradition of local blockade runners, Saxis is mentioned in Union reports and correspondence as the site of capture of blockade running vessels based in other ports of the Eastern Shore.

Fishing and oyster dredging prospered as commercial enterprises on the island beginning in the 1860s. In 1866, the extension of the Pennsylvania Railroad to nearby Crisfield, Maryland, helped to spur local growth of commercial oystering. The seafood industry on Saxis boomed at the beginning of the twentieth century, with the 1903 construction of an unconnected wharf 650 yards offshore at the edge of the shipping channel. After the Civil War, the steamers &quot;Maggie&quot; and &quot;The Eastern Shore&quot; carried the seafood products of Saxis to the Northern cities. The steamers also brought many visitors to Saxis at that time.

==Recreation==
The Saxis fishing pier was completed in 2002. The pier extends 200 feet into Saxis Harbor and terminates with a 100-foot T-head. The pier is often used for public fishing. It is handicapped-accessible and ADA-compliant.

The town abuts the 6,177-acre Saxis Wildlife Management Area, which is owned and managed by the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries. The Saxis Wildlife Management Area is predominately tidal marshland, divided into three tracts totaling approximately 5,678 acres. All three tracts are peninsulas, bordered by the brackish waters of Beasley Bay, Pocomoke Sound or Messongo Creek, or several smaller freshwater creeks. Forested high ground, or hummocks, occupy portions of the area farthest inland. Maintained primarily in its natural state, there is little active management or development in the area.

The town is also home to the Saxis Island Museum, a nonprofit created to preserve the history of Saxis Island and to document the lives of the people that made a living in the waters of the Chesapeake Bay.

==Geography==
Saxis is located at (37.925825, −75.723184).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.30%, is water. Although water does not completely surround Saxis Island, the name is appropriate because of the landform&#x27;s geographic isolation. Separated from the mainland by the maritime tidal Freeschool Marsh on the east, Saxis is bounded by shallow waters on the south (Starling Creek), west (Pocomoke Sound), and north (Robin Hood Bay).

It has an elevation of 7 feet.

==Industry==
The harbor is a local hub of economic activity. The fisheries industry is based around the southern end of Saxis near the harbor. This area is classified as an Intensely Developed Area (IDA)
according to the requirements of the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act. It is also zoned commercial-waterfront (C-W). This area is intended to provide space for activities and services relating to the seafood industry.

<text>Tangier is a town in Accomack County, Virginia, United States, on Tangier Island in the Chesapeake Bay. The population was 436 at the 2020 census. Since 1850, the island&#x27;s landmass has been reduced by 67%. Under the mid-range sea level rise scenario, much of the remaining landmass is expected to be lost in the next 50 years and the town will likely need to be abandoned.

The people who came to permanently settle the island arrived in the 1770s, and were farmers. In the late 19th century, the islanders began to become more dependent on harvesting crabs and oysters from the Chesapeake Bay. As the waterman livelihood became more important and more lucrative, there were often conflicts among the oyster dredgers and oyster tongers in the bay, and between those living in Maryland and those living in Virginia.

Many people who live on Tangier speak a distinctive dialect of Southern American English. Scholars have disputed how much of the dialect is derived from British English lexicon and phonetics, particularly from Cornish. Linguist David Shores has argued that there is little evidence for this claim and, while the Tangier dialect is distinctive, it is more likely a mixture of several regional dialects on the Eastern Seaboard. The persistence of this dialectal variety is often attributed to the geographic isolation of the population from the mainland. Tangier Island is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== History ==
Tangier Island was likely used as a hunting and fishing ground by Native Americans prior to European arrival. A number of Native American artifacts and a large oyster midden have been found on the island, but the island was not inhabited when it was visited in 1608 by John Smith. Smith called the region the &quot;Russel Isles&quot;, but it is unclear whether this name was applied originally to Tangier, the nearby Watts Island, or both.

In 1670, Ambrose White, a tavern owner from Accomac, Virginia, received a patent for the island. The next year, it was transferred to Charles Scarburgh and John West, two prominent estate owners from Accomack County who used the island to graze livestock.

Today many of the inhabitants have the surname Crockett, which was the name of the first permanent Anglo-American settler in the late 18th century, John Crockett. Other common surnames on the island include Pruitt, Thomas, Marshall, Charnock, Dise, Shores, and Parks. By 1900 there were 1,064 inhabitants.

The British used the island as a staging area in 1813 and 1814 under Rear Admiral George Cockburn during the War of 1812, constructing Fort Albion when there were as many as 1,200 British troops recorded as being present on the island at one time. Many black slaves escaped to the British on Tangier and were given their freedom. Some joined the Corps of Colonial Marines. When a dozen British sailors were captured, their account both of the hardships encountered there, with shortages of food and water on the island, and of the construction of Fort Albion were reported in a local newspaper.

Tangier was used as the base for the attack on the American capital in the decisive British victory at Bladensburg and the subsequent Burning of Washington in August 1814. This was followed by the Battle of Baltimore, when a failed British naval bombardment and barge assault on Fort McHenry in Baltimore harbor and the simultaneous Battle of North Point southeast of the city on September 12–14, 1814, influenced Francis Scott Key&#x27;s writing of the poem that became &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, named the American national anthem in 1931.

In February 1936, the US Army Air Corps used 13 B-10Bs of the 49th Bomb Squadron to drop supplies to the residents of Virginia&#x27;s Tangier Island and Maryland&#x27;s Smith Island; with ships unable to reach the islands due to heavy ice in the Chesapeake Bay, the islanders faced starvation after a severe winter storm.

The original church on the island was called Lee&#x27;s Bethel and burned down in the 19th century. A bench marking its location is in the graveyard in Canton. The oldest church that still exists on the island, Swain Memorial Methodist Church, was established in 1835. The only other currently standing church on the island is called the New Testament Congregation, established in 1946, and is a non-denominational Christian place of worship. For various reasons, both historical and practical (such as overcrowding), burials are sometimes located in the yards of houses. There are also churchyard cemeteries at each of the island&#x27;s churches.

Three 21st-century hurricanes, Isabel in 2003, Ernesto in 2006, and Sandy in 2012, caused much of the island to flood. A few houses were abandoned or torn down due to storm damage, while others have been elevated on new foundations. New buildings continue to be built on the island.

In the 1960s, the United States Army took over portions of Tangier Island via eminent domain, forcing some residents, including Walter Crockett and Maggie Eskridge Crockett, to move to Exmore, on mainland Virginia, so the military could conduct missile testing.

== Geography ==

Tangier Island is located in the Chesapeake Bay in Accomack County, Virginia. The island is composed of three sandy ridges divided by marshes and tidal streams. These three ridges, called West Ridge, Main Ridge, and Canton Ridge from west to east, run parallel north-to-south. Most of the island&#x27;s institutions, including the post office, restaurants, and Tangier Combined School, are located on the Main Ridge. The island&#x27;s West Ridge has four bridges to the Main Ridge and a seawall built in 1990 to combat erosion, and it is also home to Tangier Island Airport. Canton Ridge is connected by just one bridge and, while once the largest ridge with up to 30 families, today is the smallest ridge and home to just a few families.

Some smaller, mostly uninhabited, islands surround Tangier. The largest of these, called Uppards and located just north of the main island, was home to a community of up to 40 families called Canaan before its abandonment in 1928 due to the enlargement of the channel separating it from Tangier. Today, the island contains a few structures used as hunting lodges. Port Isobel, also called East Point Marsh, lies to the east-northeast and is home to an education center owned by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. Some other formerly inhabited islands lie north of Uppards, and some others have been submerged; these include Shanks, Wheeler&#x27;s Hole, Fishbone, and Piney Islands.

===Reduction in land mass===

The island is at risk of disappearing due to upland to wetland conversion and rising sea levels caused by climate change; since 1850, the island&#x27;s landmass has been reduced by 67%. Under a mid-range sea level rise scenario, two of the islands&#x27; three ridges are expected to become wetland in the 2030s, with the third expected to succumb by 2051.

Many residents believe that erosion is the cause of the increasing incidence and severity of flooding. A 2015 study by Davide M. Schulte, Karin M. Dridge, and Mark H. Hudgins, all members of the Army Corps of Engineers, concluded that Tangier has 25–50 years of habitability remaining and that the subsidence of the ridges is ongoing since at least the mid-19th century. The authors also conclude that the primary causes of the subsidence in the southern Chesapeake Bay region are sea-level rise due to the melting of the Laurentide ice sheet, groundwater extraction on mainland Virginia, and the remaining effects of the Chesapeake Bay impact crater near Cape Charles, Virginia, 35.5 million years ago.

The town has been talking with political representatives for decades to get protection for the island in the form of jetties or sea walls. The Town, the History Museum, and townspeople continue to raise money for their sea wall fund. In 2017, CNN aired a story about Tangier that featured the town&#x27;s mayor, James W. Eskridge. President Donald Trump called the mayor personally to assure him that the town would survive but offered no concrete form of relief or financial aid.
===Marshes and waterfowl===

Tangier and nearby islands are valuable tidal salt marsh habitat for waterfowl, especially as there is a general absence of predators for ground-nesting birds and birds in general. Tangier marshes are home to many birds, including pelicans, blue herons, rails, egrets, several varieties of ducks and geese, and osprey. The group of islands is one of the &quot;few remaining population strongholds for American Black Ducks in Virginia.&quot;

Including the surrounding marshes, Tangier Island totals less than , but only are high enough for habitation. The highest point of land is barely above sea level, and about of Tangier shoreline are estimated to erode into the Chesapeake each year. Local residents see their existence threatened from falling catches, state regulation of the waterman livelihood on the Bay, constant erosion, and increasingly frequent flooding.

==Transportation==

The only modes of transportation to and from the island are boats and airplanes. There is an airport, open from dawn to dusk. There are two boats that travel regularly from Crisfield, Maryland, across Tangier Sound to Tangier. Passengers and mail are carried on these boats. The mail boat, the &quot;Courtney Thomas,&quot; leaves Tangier at 8:00 am and leaves Crisfield at 12:30 pm. The &quot;Steven Thomas&quot;, a 300-passenger cruise boat, leaves Crisfield at 12:30 pm and departs Tangier at 4:00 pm during the summer season – from Memorial Day weekend through mid-October. In the summer season, the &quot;Chesapeake Breeze&quot; travels daily from Reedville, Virginia, on the Western Shore, leaving Reedville at 10:00 am and leaving Tangier at 2:00 pm. The ferry service to and from Onancock, Virginia on the &quot;Joyce Marie II&quot; runs daily from the first weekend of May through the first weekend of October.

Transportation on the island does not rely heavily on automobiles. Some residents outfit golf carts with passenger trailers to offer &quot;historical tours&quot; of the island for tourists. The roads on Tangier are wide enough for two golf carts. Tourists and islanders often use golf carts, boats, mopeds, and bikes, but some have trucks and cars.

== Language ==

Many who live on Tangier Island speak a distinctive dialect of Southern American English, which scholars have disputed as derived from 17th and 18th-century British English (Early Modern and Modern English) lexicon and phonetics. Historical linguist David Shores has noted that, while it may sound like a British variety of English, the dialect is a creation of its own time and place off the eastern shore of Virginia, preserving certain features of its British origins in part due to isolation, but not unchanged. The persistence of this dialectical variety is often attributed to the geographic isolation of the population from the mainland. Many non-scholarly sources (i.e. the popular media and press) report that the unique dialect originated from early European settlers from Cornwall and Devon in the United Kingdom, but this is disputed by Shores. BBC Travel made a short film on the dialect.

Before bridges were built, the only form of transport between or off the ridges was by boat, allowing the islands to stay isolated from the mainland.

The local accent is sometimes compared to that of the &quot;Hoi Toiders&quot; of the Outer Banks of North Carolina. There are some similarities, but the dialects are distinct. Smith Island, Maryland, which is near Tangier, has a dialect that is more similar to that of Tangier in terms of phonetics and lexicon.

== Economy ==

===Industry===

Today, the inhabitants of Tangier rely on crabbing to make a living. Tangier is often called the &quot;soft-shell crab capital of the world&quot;, and has been referred to as one of the last waterman communities. Most fishermen catch and sell crabs and oysters. North of the island are many free-standing docks not connected to land which fishermen use to hold crabs while they moult. Once a major industry on the island, oystering has returned in recent years as a supplement to the more prominent crabbing business. In 2014, a new oyster-farming company, called Tangier Island Oyster Company, was founded by a group that includes a former attorney general of Virginia, Ken Cuccinelli.

The primary industry on the island besides fishing is tourism. During the summer, several cruise ships come to the island each day, allowing passengers to explore and buy goods from the islanders. Two bed-and-breakfast inns can accommodate a limited number of overnight guests. There are several restaurants and gift shops for the tourist trade.

===Activities===

With all the means of transportation and regular telephone service, residents have regular ways of staying in touch with the mainland. The island also has cable television and internet service. The island has several restaurants, an ice cream shop, four gift shops and a hardware store. There is a wild beach without a boardwalk or concessions. There is a historical museum and interpretive cultural center. Tangier is known for its seafood dishes, especially its soft-shell crab sandwiches.

The major new addition to the island has been the Tangier Island History Museum, which created historical markers that line Tangier&#x27;s streets and provides a &quot;historical tour&quot; of the island.

==Institutions and culture==
The Tangier Island Health Foundation runs the Nichols Health Center on Tangier, which is operated by the Riverside Health System, which also operates on the Eastern Shore of Virginia and in Hampton Roads.

Historically, there were two cases of Tangier disease, a recessive genetic disorder that causes high blood cholesterol. These two instances represented the first ever discovery of the disease. Thus, the disease was subsequently named after the island. There are very few residents with this genetic anomaly who currently live on the island.

The residents of Tangier enjoy regular cable television and internet access through a microwave tower installed in spring 2010. There are phone lines on the island. One physician assistant and a number of registered nurses live on the island. David Nichols treated residents for thirty years, piloting a Cessna 182 or Robinson helicopter for once-a-week visits. In January 2007, he was profiled by ABC &quot;World News Tonight&quot; as its Person of the Week. Nichols died at the age of 62 on December 30, 2010, after a battle with cancer. Four months earlier, a new clinic was christened in his name, as he and a few others had raised funds for its construction. Emergency patients travel by helicopter to Crisfield or Salisbury hospitals in Maryland. Although the island has one operational power plant, it is used mainly for emergencies. Power comes in from the Eastern Shore of Virginia through an underwater cable.
Methodism has been and remains a very strong influence on Tangier, stemming from the charismatic preaching and revival camp meetings held there in the early 1800s by Joshua Thomas, the famed &quot;parson of the islands.&quot; Because of their ties to the Northern Methodist Church, Tangier residents in the 19th century did not support slavery and did not join Virginia in seceding from the Union during the Civil War.

A local ordinance prohibits the sale of alcohol, making the island &quot;dry.&quot; In 1999, the Tangier town council blocked Warner Brothers from using the island to film the Kevin Costner film &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot;, objecting to the script&#x27;s drinking, profanity, and sex.

=== Education ===
Accomack County Public Schools operates the Tangier Combined School, the sole comprehensive K–12 public school in the Commonwealth of Virginia. , it had 60 students.

== Demographics ==

Originally called &quot;Wayland&#x27;s Crossing,&quot; it was renamed in 1870 in honor of Colonel Claudius Crozet, the French-born civil engineer who directed the construction of the Blue Ridge Tunnel. The cornerstone of Crozet is believed to have been Pleasant Green, a property also known as the Ficklin-Wayland Farm, located yards from the actual Wayland Crossing. Claudius Crozet is said to have lodged in that property while surveying the land that today honors his name.

== Economy ==
Historically, Crozet was strategically important as a depot and transportation hub for the local apple and peach growing industries. Morton Frozen Foods had its flagship manufacturing plant in Crozet from August 1, 1953, until the late 1990s. In 2000, the plant was closed by food packaging company ConAgra Foods, which owned the brand, laying off more than 600 employees. As of 2016, Musictoday, acquired in 2014 by San Francisco-based Delivery Agent Inc., an interactive entertainment-commerce firm, operates out of the building, as does Starr Hill Brewery, which moved from Charlottesville in 2006.

From 1990 to 2005, Crozet saw increasing housing development, in part because of nearby Charlottesville&#x27;s reputation as a desirable location, but also because Albemarle County named Crozet as a designated growth area. Some 95% of the County remains designated as rural.

In 2001, the Albemarle County Board of Supervisors approved a framework dubbed the &quot;Crozet Master Plan&quot;, developed by a local architect and regional planning firm, to regulate development patterns and provide a public forum for discussing the topic. The Master Plan allows the population of Crozet, then around 3,000, to quadruple to more than 12,000 by the 2020s. These numbers alarmed some long-time residents who are accustomed to the rural tranquility of Crozet; more than a thousand people petitioned the county to reduce the number of planned households. In 2006, a plan was approved to redevelop the old Barnes Lumber property, which encompasses much of the downtown section. In 2007, the population passed 7,000.

Around 2017, Piedmont Place, a complex of luxury apartments and various restaurants and shops, was built in downtown Crozet.

==Arts and culture==

Festivals include the Crozet Arts and Crafts Festival. The Crozet Library originally located in a railway depot built in 1923 by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. A new library, the Crozet/Western Albemarle Library, is located here.

==Parks and recreation==
Claudius Crozet Park is a park which includes athletic fields, ball courts, playgrounds, a dog park, pool, and fitness center.

==Education==
===Schools===

Crozet is served by Western Albemarle High School, J. T. Henley Middle School, Brownsville Elementary School, Meriwether
Lewis Elementary School, Murray Elementary School and Crozet Elementary School. All schools in Crozet are part of Albemarle County Public Schools.

==Media==
The 2007 comedy film &quot;Evan Almighty&quot; (the sequel to &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot;) was partially filmed in Crozet. The ark seen in the movie, as well as the set for Evan&#x27;s neighborhood, was constructed there. The film set was situated on a plot of land across from Western Albemarle High School, Old Trail, which later became a popular housing subdivision.

<text>Amherst (formerly Dearborn) is a town in Amherst County, Virginia, United States. The population was 2,231 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Amherst County.

Amherst is part of the Lynchburg Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Amherst was founded in 1807. Originally known as &quot;The Oaks&quot; and &quot;Seven Oaks&quot;, it began as a stagecoach station on the Charlottesville-Lynchburg road. Once Nelson County was separated from Amherst County in 1807, the community became the seat of Amherst County. It was at this time that the village decided to rename itself in honor of French and Indian War hero Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst. Major-General Amherst had been the hero of the Battle of Ticonderoga and later served as the governor of the Colony of Virginia from 1763 to 1768.

In 1847, local planter William Waller, aged 58, walked from Amherst to Louisiana with about 20 slaves for sale. His letters home during the trip, held by the Virginia Historical Society, provide rare documentation of a slave coffle.

On April 15, 1910, Amherst was incorporated by the order of the Circuit Court. A charter was granted to the town by the General Assembly in 1950.

The official town seal was created by Ward Cruea, a commercial artist from Dayton, Ohio. His original proposal featured the &quot;sleeping giant&quot; (the Blue Ridge Mountain ridgeline west of Amherst), but this was rejected as it represented an area outside the town&#x27;s limits. According to town legend, while a group was in the Clerk&#x27;s office in the town hall engaged in conversation on the topics of the day, and looking eastward along East Court Street, it was suggested that the Amherst courthouse be used as a model for the official seal. During that era, a large letter &quot;A&quot; was attached to a radio antenna tower beside the telephone company building adjacent to the courthouse. This internally illuminated &quot;A&quot; was used as a visual navigation beacon by aircraft pilots. Approximately six months later Cruea returned to the town and delivered a framed original of a proposed seal. It incorporated the courthouse, the &quot;A,&quot; and the town&#x27;s date of incorporation. Cruea&#x27;s proposal was adopted soon thereafter and became Amherst&#x27;s official seal. The original seal is located on the wall of the town council chambers.

One of the main landmarks of the town is the roundabout located at the intersection of Main Street and U.S. Route 60. &quot;The Circle,&quot; as it is affectionately referred to by Amherst residents, is the oldest traffic circle in the Virginia Department of Transportation system. The Village Garden Club installed and maintains the fountain and the landscaping at the circle.

Another Amherst landmark is the Amherst County courthouse. An original courthouse was built in 1809 but was torn down in 1872, and the current building was built shortly thereafter. All Amherst County records have been stored there since 1761 when Amherst‑Nelson counties were divided from Albemarle County.

The Thompson&#x27;s Mill-Amherst Mill Complex was previously home to Amherst Milling Co. The main building is an “evolved” structure with elements dating from at least the late 19th- entury. It was active in the production of cornmeal and flour before closing in 2017. In 2018, the Virginia Department of Historic Resources placed the building on its Virginia Landmarks Register.

Other important sites located in or near the town include the Bear Mountain Indian Mission School, Edgewood, 1818, Edgewood, 1858, Fairview, Forest Hill, The Glebe, Dulwich Manor, and Tusculum. These places are all listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>The Acadia Divinity College (ADC) is Baptist theological institute located in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada. It is affiliated with the Canadian Baptists of Atlantic Canada. It is governed by a board of trustees with members appointed by the Convention and the Board of Governors of Acadia University. The college is also the Faculty of Theology of Acadia University. 

ADC shares facilities with Acadia University; the college&#x27;s library is part of the university&#x27;s 800,000 volume Vaughan Memorial Library collection. Also hosted at Acadia University are the Esther Clark Wright Archives, which includes an extensive collection of material relating to the Canadian Baptists of Atlantic Canada (CBAC).

==History==
As early as 1830, Baptists in Nova Scotia, Canada established a &quot;department of pious scholars&quot; at Horton Academy in Wolfville (founded 1828) for ministerial training. A decade later, Baptist Leaders resolved to establish a Baptist College, an institution of higher learning where all people would be free to work and study, regardless of religious persuasion. The decision to establish Queen&#x27;s College, which would become Acadia University, was formally approved by the Nova Scotia Baptist Education Society on November 15, 1838. Preparation for ministry was carried on under various formats until the School of Theology was put on a more formal footing in 1923.

After Acadia University was reorganized in 1966, the Baptists of Atlantic Canada began to operate the School of Theology under the name Acadia Divinity College, and on June 1, 1968, the Acadia Divinity College was established by an act of the Nova Scotia Legislature.

== Centres of Excellence at Acadia Divinity College ==

=== Acadia Centre for Baptist and Anabaptist Studies (ACBAS) ===
Established by Acadia Divinity College in cooperation with the Vaughan Memorial Library of Acadia University in April 1991, encourages and facilitates studies in the fields of Baptist and Anabaptist history and thought, especially in the Atlantic region of Canada.

=== Charles J. Taylor Centre for Chaplaincy and Spiritual Care ===
The Taylor Centre trains and prepares men and women for pastoral ministry in specialized forms, including hospital chaplaincy, military chaplaincy, prison chaplaincy, and a variety of other caring professions, for which care for the Spirit is of primary importance.

=== Andrew D. MacRae Centre for Christian Faith and Culture ===
Provides a forum for helping students and the wider church engage with people and issues, and as a research hub.

== Teaching sites ==
=== Wolfville, Nova Scotia ===
Students can complete any bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, or doctoral degree or program part-time or full-time at ADC&#x27;s main teaching site located on the campus of Acadia University in Wolfville. All courses required for all degrees are offered on a rotating basis over a two- or three-year period in a variety of teaching formats including once weekly, intensive weeks, and on weekends. All courses are taught in a hybrid formatting allowing students to attend classes from anywhere in the world.

== Continuing education ==

=== Simpson Lectures ===
Mr. Gerald K. Simpson of Fairhaven, Deer Island, New Brunswick, established an endowment in 1979 to finance an annual series of lectures on the practice of ministry prepared primarily for students, pastors, and spouses. The lecturers are outstanding persons in ministry who focus on the role of the minister as both preacher and pastor. This lectureship has welcomed many distinguished preachers including John N. Gladstone, Haddon W. Robinson, Alan Sell, and Gardner Taylor.

The graduate degrees are accredited by the Association for Biblical Higher Education and the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada.
