<text>Miscegenation ( ) is a marriage or admixture between people who are members of different races or ethnicities. It has occurred many times throughout history, in many places. It has occasionally been controversial or illegal. Adjectives describing miscegenation include &quot;interethnic&quot;, &quot;mixed-race&quot;, &quot;multiethnic&quot;, &quot;multiracial&quot;, and &quot;interracial&quot;.

==Etymological history==

&quot;Miscegenation&quot; comes from the Latin , &#x27;to mix&#x27; and , &#x27;kind&#x27;. The word was coined in an anonymous propaganda pamphlet published in New York City in December 1863, during the American Civil War. The pamphlet was entitled &quot;Miscegenation: The Theory of the Blending of the Races, Applied to the American White Man and Negro&quot;. It purported to advocate the intermarriage of whites and blacks until they were indistinguishably mixed, as desirable, and further asserted that this was a goal of the Republican Party. The pamphlet was a hoax, concocted by Democrats to discredit the Republicans by imputing to them what were then radical views that would offend the vast majority of whites, even those who opposed slavery. The issue of miscegenation, raised by the opponents of Abraham Lincoln, featured prominently in the election campaign of 1864. In his fourth debate with Stephen A. Douglas, Lincoln took great care to emphasize that he supported the law of Illinois which forbade &quot;the marrying of white people with negroes&quot;.

The pamphlet and variations on it were reprinted widely in both the North and South by Democrats and Confederates. Only in November 1864, after Lincoln had won the election, was the pamphlet exposed in the United States as a hoax. It was written by David Goodman Croly, managing editor of the &quot;New York World&quot;, a Democratic Party paper, and George Wakeman, a &quot;World&quot; reporter. By then, the word &quot;miscegenation&quot; had entered the common language of the day as a popular buzzword in political and social discourse. Before the publication of &quot;Miscegenation&quot;, the words &quot;racial intermixing&quot; and &quot;amalgamation&quot; were used as general terms for ethnic and racial genetic mixing. Contemporary usage of the &quot;amalgamation&quot; metaphor, borrowed from metallurgy, was that of Ralph Waldo Emerson&#x27;s private vision in 1845 of America as an ethnic and racial smelting-pot, a variation on the concept of the melting pot. Opinions in the United States on the desirability of such intermixing, including that between white Protestants and Irish Catholic immigrants, were divided. The term &quot;miscegenation&quot; was coined to refer specifically to the intermarriage of blacks and whites, with the intent of galvanizing opposition to the war.

In Spanish America, the term , which is derived from , a term used to describe a person who is the offspring of an Indigenous American and a European. The primary reason why there are so few indigenous peoples of Central and South America remaining is because of the persistent and pervasive miscegenation between the Iberian colonists and the indigenous American population, which is the most common admixture of ethnicities found in the genetic tests of present-day Latinos. This explains why Latinos in North America, the vast majority of whom are immigrants or descendants of immigrants from Central and South America, carry an average of 18% Native American ancestry, and 65.1% European ancestry (mostly from the Iberian Peninsula).

==Usage==
In the present day, the use of the word &quot;miscegenation&quot; is avoided by many scholars because the term suggests that race is a concrete biological phenomenon, rather than a categorization which is imposed on certain relationships. The term&#x27;s historical usage in contexts which typically implied disapproval is also a reason why more unambiguously neutral terms such as &quot;interracialism&quot;, &quot;interethnicism&quot; or &quot;cross-culturalism&quot; are more common in contemporary usage. The term remains in use among scholars when referring to past practices concerning multiraciality, such as anti-miscegenation laws that banned interracial marriages. The term is &quot;especially&quot; used by people who believe in racial superiority or purity and object to interracial relationships. 

In Spanish, Portuguese, and French, the words used to describe the mixing of races are &quot;mestizaje&quot;, &quot;mestiçagem&quot;, and &quot;métissage&quot; respectively. These words, much older than the term &quot;miscegenation&quot;, are derived from the Late Latin &quot;mixticius&quot; for &quot;mixed&quot;, which is also the root of the Spanish word &quot;mestizo&quot;. (Portuguese also uses &quot;miscigenação&quot;, derived from the same Latin root as the English word.) These non-English terms for &quot;race-mixing&quot; are not considered as offensive as &quot;miscegenation&quot;, although they have historically been tied to the caste system (casta) that was established during the colonial era in Spanish-speaking Latin America.

Today, the mixes among races and ethnicities are diverse, so it is considered preferable to use the term &quot;mixed-race&quot; or simply &quot;mixed&quot; (&quot;mezcla&quot;). In Portuguese-speaking Latin America (i.e., Brazil), a milder form of caste system existed, although it also provided for legal and social discrimination among individuals belonging to different races, since slavery for black people existed until the late 19th century. Intermarriage occurred significantly from the very first settlements to the present day, affording mixed people upward mobility in Brazil for Black Brazilians, a phenomenon known as the &quot;mulatto escape hatch&quot;. To this day, there are controversies regarding whether the Brazilian class system would be drawn mostly around socioeconomic lines, not racial ones (in a manner similar to other former Portuguese colonies). Conversely, people classified in censuses as black, brown (&quot;pardo&quot;) or indigenous have disadvantaged social indicators in comparison to the white population.

The concept of miscegenation is tied to concepts of racial difference. As the different connotations and etymologies of &quot;miscegenation&quot; and &quot;mestizaje&quot; suggest, definitions of race, &quot;race mixing&quot; and multiraciality have diverged globally as well as historically, depending on changing social circumstances and cultural perceptions. Mestizo are people of mixed white and indigenous, usually Amerindian ancestry, who do not self-identify as indigenous peoples or Native Americans. In Canada, however, the Métis, who also have partly Amerindian and partly white, often French Canadian, ancestry, have identified as an ethnic group and are a constitutionally recognized aboriginal people.

Interracial marriages are often disparaged in racial minority communities as well. Data from the Pew Research Center has shown that African Americans are twice as likely as white Americans to believe that interracial marriage &quot;is a bad thing&quot;. There is a considerable amount of scientific literature that demonstrates similar patterns. The differences between related terms and words which encompass aspects of racial admixture show the impact of different historical and cultural factors leading to changing social interpretations of race and ethnicity. Thus the Comte de Montlosier, in exile during the French Revolution, equated class difference in 18th-century France with racial difference. Borrowing Boulainvilliers&#x27; discourse on the &quot;Nordic race&quot; as being the French aristocracy that invaded the plebeian &quot;Gauls&quot;, he showed his contempt for the lowest social class, the Third Estate, calling it &quot;this new person born of slaves ... a mixture of all races and of all times&quot;.

==History==

Interracial relationships have profoundly influenced various regions throughout history. Africa has had a long history of interracial mixing with non-Africans, since prehistoric times, with migrations from the Levant leading to significant admixture. This continued into antiquity with Arab and European explorers, traders, and soldiers having relationships with African women. Mixed-race communities like the Coloureds in South Africa and Basters in Namibia emerged from these unions. In the Americas and Asia, similar patterns of interracial relationships and communities formed. In the US, historical taboos and laws against interracial marriage evolved, culminating in the landmark &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; case in 1967. Latin America, particularly Brazil, has a rich history of racial mixing, reflected in its diverse population. In Asia, countries like India, China, and Japan experienced interracial unions through trade, colonization, and migration, contributing to diverse genetic and cultural landscapes.

In Europe, Nazi Germany&#x27;s anti-miscegenation laws sought to maintain &quot;racial purity,&quot; specifically targeting Jewish-German unions. Hungary and France saw mixed marriages through historical conquests and colonialism, such as between Vietnamese men and French women during the early 20th century. In Oceania, particularly Australia and New Zealand, dynamics varied; Australia had policies like the White Australia policy and practices affecting Indigenous populations, while New Zealand saw significant Māori and European intermarriages. In the Middle East, inter-ethnic relationships were common, often involving Arab and non-Arab unions. Portuguese colonies encouraged mixed marriages to integrate populations, notably seen in Brazil and other territories, resulting in diverse, multicultural societies.

===Laws banning miscegenation===
Laws banning &quot;race-mixing&quot; were enforced in certain U.S. states until 1967 (but they were still on the books in some states until 2000), in Nazi Germany (the Nuremberg Laws) from 1935 until 1945, and in South Africa during the apartheid era (1949–1985). All of these laws primarily banned marriage between persons who were members of different racially or ethnically defined groups, which was termed &quot;amalgamation&quot; or &quot;miscegenation&quot; in the United States. The laws in Nazi Germany and the laws in many U.S. states, as well as the laws in South Africa, also banned sexual relations between such individuals.

In the United States, various state laws prohibited marriages between whites and blacks, and in many states, they also prohibited marriages between whites and Native Americans as well as marriages between whites and Asians. In the United States, such laws were known as anti-miscegenation laws, with the Maryland General Assembly the first to criminalize interracial marriage in 1691. From 1913 until 1948, 30 out of the then 48 states enforced such laws. Although an &quot;Anti-Miscegenation Amendment&quot; to the United States Constitution was proposed in 1871, in 1912–1913, and again in 1928, no nationwide law against racially mixed marriages was ever enacted. In 1967, the United States Supreme Court unanimously ruled in &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; that anti-miscegenation laws are unconstitutional via the Fourteenth Amendment adopted in 1868. With this ruling, these laws were no longer in effect in the remaining 16 states which still had them.

The Nazi ban on interracial sexual relations and marriages was enacted in September 1935 as part of the Nuremberg Laws, the &quot;Gesetz zum Schutze des deutschen Blutes und der deutschen Ehre&quot; (The Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour). The Nuremberg Laws classified Jews as a race, and they also forbade extramarital sexual relations and marriages between persons who were classified as &quot;Aryans&quot; and persons who were classified as &quot;non-Aryans&quot;. Violations of these laws were condemned as &quot;Rassenschande&quot; (lit. &quot;race-disgrace/race-shame&quot;) and they could be punished by imprisonment (usually followed by deportation to a concentration camp) and could even be punished by death.

The Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act in South Africa, enacted in 1949, banned intermarriages between members of different racial groups, including intermarriages between whites and non-whites. The Immorality Act, enacted in 1950, also made it a criminal offense for a white person to have any sexual relations with a person who was a member of a different race. Both of these laws were repealed in 1985.

==Demographics of ethnoracial admixture==

===United States===
According to the U.S. Census, in 2000 there were 504,119 Asian–white marriages, 287,576 black-white marriages, and 31,271 Asian–black marriages. The black–white marriages increased from 65,000 in 1970 to 403,000 in 2006, and 558,000 in 2010, according to Census Bureau figures.

In the United States, rates of interracial cohabitation are significantly higher than those of marriage. Although only 7 percent of married African American men have Caucasian American wives, 13% of cohabitating African American men have Caucasian American partners. 25% of married Asian American women have Caucasian spouses, but 45% of cohabitating Asian American women are with Caucasian American men. Of cohabiting Asian men, slightly over 37% of Asian men have white female partners over 10% married White American women. Asian American women and Asian American men who live with a white partner, 40 and 27 percent, respectively (Le, 2006b). In 2008, of new marriages including an Asian man, 80% were to an Asian spouse and 14% to a White spouse; of new marriages involving an Asian woman, 61% were to an Asian spouse and 31% to a White spouse. Almost 30% of Asians and Latinos outmarry, with 86.8 and 90% of these, respectively, being to a white person. According to Karyn Langhorne Folan, &quot;although the most recent census available reported that 70% of African American women are single, African American women have the greatest resistance to marrying &#x27;out&#x27; of the race.&quot;

One survey revealed that 19% of black males had engaged in sexual activity with white women. A Gallup poll on interracial dating in June 2006 found 75% of Americans approving of a white man dating a black woman, and 71% approving of a black man dating a white woman. Among people between the ages of 18 and 29, the poll found that 95% approved of blacks and whites dating, and about 60% said they had dated someone of a different race. 69% of Hispanics, 52% of non-Hispanic blacks, and 45% of non-Hispanic whites said they have dated someone of another race or ethnic group. In 1980, just 17% of all respondents said they had dated someone from a different racial background.

However, according to a study from the University of California at Berkeley, using data from over 1 million profiles of singles from online dating websites, whites were far more reluctant to date outside their race than non-whites. The study found that over 80% of whites, including whites who stated no racial preference, contacted other whites, whereas about 3% of whites contacted blacks, a result that held for younger and older participants. Only 5% of whites responded to inquiries from blacks. Black participants were ten times more likely to contact whites than whites were to contact blacks, however black participants sent inquiries to other blacks more often than otherwise.

Interracial marriage is still relatively uncommon, despite the increasing rate. In 2010, 15% of new marriages were interracial, and of those only 9% of Whites married outside of their race. However, this takes into account inter ethnic marriages, this meaning it counts white Hispanics marrying non-Hispanic whites as interracial marriages, despite both bride and groom being racially white. Of the 275,000 new interracial marriages in 2010, 43% were white-Hispanic, 14.4% were white-Asian, 11.9% were white-black and the rest were other combinations. However, interracial marriage has become more common over the past decades due to increasing racial diversity, and liberalizing attitudes toward the practice. The number of interracial marriages in the United States increased by 65% between 1990 and 2000, and by 20% between 2000 and 2010. &quot;A record 14.6% of all new marriages in the United States in 2008 were between spouses of a different race or ethnicity from one another. ... Rates more than doubled among whites and nearly tripled among blacks between 1980 and 2008. But for both Hispanics and Asians, rates were nearly identical in 2008 and 1980&quot;, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

According to studies by Jenifer L. Bratter and Rosalind B. King made publicly available on the Education Resources Information Center, White female-Black male and White female-Asian male marriages are more prone to divorce than White-White pairings. Conversely, unions between White males and non-White females (and between Hispanics and non-Hispanic persons) have similar or lower risks of divorce than White-White marriages, unions between white male-black female last longer than white-white pairings or white-Asian pairings.

===Brazil===
In the 2022 census, 92.1 million people or 45.3% of Brazil&#x27;s population identified themselves as &quot;pardos&quot;, meaning brown or mixed race. According to some DNA researches, Brazilians predominantly possess some degree of mixed-race ancestry, though less than half of the country&#x27;s population classified themselves as &quot;pardos&quot; in the census. Multiracial Brazilians live in all regions of Brazil, they are mainly people of mixed European, African, East Asian (mostly Japanese) and Amerindian ancestry.

Interracial marriages constituted 22.6% of all marriages in 2000. 15.7% of blacks, 24.4% of whites and 27.6% of &quot;Pardos&quot; (mixed-race/brown) married someone whose race was different from their own.

==Genetic admixture==

Sexual reproduction between two populations reduces the genetic distance between the populations. During the Age of Discovery which began in the early 15th century, European explorers sailed all across the globe reaching all the major continents. In the process they came into contact with many populations that had been isolated for thousands of years. The Tasmanian Aboriginals were one of the most isolated groups on the planet. Many died from disease and conflict, but a number of their descendants survive today as multiracial people of Tasmanian and European descent. This is an example of how modern migrations may reduce the genetic divergence of the human species, which would usually lead to speciation.

New World demographics were radically changed within a short time following the voyage of Columbus. The colonization of the Americas brought Native Americans into contact with the distant populations of Europe, Africa and Asia. As a result, many countries in the Americas have significant and complex multiracial populations.

===Admixture in the United States===

Genetic studies indicate that many African-Americans possess varying degrees of European admixture, although it is suggested that the Native American admixture in African-Americans is exaggerated. Some estimates from studies indicated that many of the African-Americans who took part, had European admixture ranging from 25 to 50% in the Northeast and less than 10% in the South (where a vast majority of the population reside). A 2003 study by Mark D. Shriver of a European-American sample found that the average admixture in the individuals who participated was 0.7% African and 3.2% Native American. However, 70% of the sample had no African admixture. The other 30% had African admixture ranging from 2% to 20% with an average of 2.3%. By extrapolating these figures to the whole population some scholars suggest that up to 74 million European-Americans may have African admixture in the same range (2–20%). Recently J.T. Frudacas, Shriver&#x27;s partner in DNA Print Genomics, contradicted him stating &quot;Five percent of European Americans exhibit some detectable level of African ancestry.&quot;

Historians estimate that 58% of enslaved women in the United States aged 15–30 years were sexually assaulted by their slave owners and other White men. One such slave owner, Thomas Jefferson, fathered his slave Sally Hemings child. While publicly opposed to race mixing, in his &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot; published in 1785, Jefferson wrote: &quot;The improvement of the blacks in body and mind, in the first instance of their mixture with the whites, has been observed by every one, and proves that their inferiority is not the effect merely of their condition of life&quot;.

Within the African-American population, the amount of African admixture is directly correlated with darker skin since less selective pressure against dark skin is applied within the group of &quot;non-passing&quot; individuals. Thus, African-Americans may have a much wider range of African admixture (&gt;0–100%), whereas European-Americans have a lower range (2–20%).
A statistical analysis done in 1958 using historical census data and historical data on immigration and birth rates concluded that 21% of the white population had black ancestors. The growth in the White population could not be attributed to births in the White population and immigration from Europe alone, but had received significant contribution from the African American population as well.
The author states in 1958:

A 2003 study on Y-chromosomes and mtDNA detected no African admixture in the European-Americans who took part in it. The sample included 628 European-American Y-chromosomes and mtDNA from 922 European-Americans According to a genome-wide study by 23andMe, White Americans (European Americans) who participated were: &quot;98.6 percent European, 0.19 percent African and 0.18 percent Native American on average.&quot;

In the United States, intermarriage among Filipinos with other races is common. They have the largest number of interracial marriages among Asian immigrant groups, as documented in California. It is also noted that 21.8% of Filipino Americans are of mixed blood, second among Asian Americans, and is the fastest growing.

===Admixture in Latin America===

====Background====
Prior to the European conquest of the Americas the demographics of Latin America was naturally 100% American Indian. Today those who identify themselves as Native Americans are small minorities in many countries. For example, the CIA lists Argentina&#x27;s at 0.9%, Brazil&#x27;s at 0.4%, and Uruguay&#x27;s at 0%. However, the range varies widely from country to country in Latin America with some countries having significantly larger Amerindian minorities.

The early conquest of Latin America was primarily carried out by male soldiers and sailors from Spain and Portugal. Since they carried very few European women on their journeys the new settlers married and fathered children with Amerindian women and also with women taken by force from Africa. This process of miscegenation was even encouraged by the Spanish Monarchy and it led to the system of stratification known as the Casta. This system had Europeans (Spaniards and Portuguese) at the top of the hierarchy followed by those of mixed race. Unmixed Blacks and Native Americans were at the bottom. A philosophy of whitening, an example of scientific racism in favor of white supremacy, emerged in which Amerindian and African culture were stigmatized in favor of European values. Many Amerindian languages were lost as mixed race offspring adopted Spanish and Portuguese as their first languages. Only towards the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century did large numbers of Europeans begin to migrate to South America and consequently altering its demographics.

In addition many Africans were shipped to regions all over the Americas and were present in many of the early voyages of the conquistadors. Brazil has the largest population of African descendants outside Africa. Other countries such as Jamaica, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador still have sizeable populations identified as Black. However countries such as Argentina do not have a visible African presence today. Census information from the early 19th century shows that people categorized as Black made up to 30% of the population, or around 400,000 people. Though almost completely absent today, their contribution to Argentine culture is significant and include the tango, the milonga and the zamba, words of Bantu origin.
The ideology of whitening encouraged non-whites to seek white or lighter skinned partners. This dilution of non-white admixture would be beneficial to their offspring as they would face less stigmatization and find it easier to assimilate into mainstream society. After successive generations of European gene flow, non-white admixture levels would drop below levels at which skin color or physical appearance is not affected thus allowing individuals to identify as White. In many regions, the native and black populations were simply overwhelmed by a succession of waves of European immigration.

Historians and scientists are thus interested in tracing the fate of Native Americans and Africans from the past to the future. The questions remain about what proportion of these populations simply died out and what proportion still has descendants alive today including those who do not racially identify themselves as their ancestors would have. Admixture testing has thus become a useful objective tool in shedding light on the demographic history of Latin America.

====Recent studies====

Unlike the United States, there were no anti-miscegenation policies in Latin America. Though still a racially stratified society there were no significant barriers to gene flow between the three populations. As a result, admixture profiles are a reflection of the colonial populations of Africans, Europeans and Amerindians. The pattern is also sex biased in that the African and Amerindian maternal lines are found in significantly higher proportions than African or Amerindian Y chromosomal lines. This is an indication that the primary mating pattern was that of European males with Amerindian or African females. According to the study more than half the White populations of the Latin American countries studied have some degree of either Native American or African admixture (MtDNA or Y chromosome). In countries such as Chile and Colombia almost the entire white population was shown to have some non-white admixture.

Frank Moya Pons, a Dominican historian documented that Spanish colonists intermarried with Taíno women, and, over time, these mestizo descendants intermarried with Africans, creating a tri-racial Creole culture. 1514 census records reveal that 40% of Spanish men in the colony of Santo Domingo had Taíno wives. A 2002 study conducted in Puerto Rico suggests that over 61% of the population possess Amerindian mtDNA.

===Admixture in the Philippines===
Historically, admixture has been a common phenomenon in the Philippines. The Philippines were originally settled by Australoid peoples called Negritos which now form the country&#x27;s aboriginal community. Admixture occurred between this earlier group and the mainstream Malayo-Polynesian population.

There has been Indian migration to and influence in the Philippines since the precolonial era. About 25% of the words in the Tagalog language are Sanskrit terms and about 5% of the country&#x27;s population possess Indian ancestry from antiquity. There has been a Chinese presence in the Philippines since the 9th century. However, large-scale migrations of Chinese to the Philippines only started during the Spanish colonial era, when the world market was opened to the Philippines. It is estimated that among Filipinos, 10%–20% have some Chinese ancestry and 1.5% are &quot;full-blooded&quot; Chinese.

According to the American anthropologist Dr. H. Otley Beyer, the ancestry of Filipinos is 2% Arab. This dates back to when Arab traders intermarried with the local Malay Filipina female populations during the pre-Spanish history of the Philippines. A recent genetic study by Stanford University indicates that at least 3.6% of the population are European or of part European descent from both Spanish and United States colonization.

===Admixture among the Romani people===

Genetic evidence has shown that the Romani people (&quot;Gypsies&quot;) originated from the Indian subcontinent and mixed with the local populations in Central Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. In the 1990s, it was discovered that Romani populations carried large frequencies of particular Y chromosomes (inherited paternally) that otherwise exist only in populations from South Asia, in addition to fairly significant frequencies of particular mitochondrial DNA (inherited maternally) that is rare outside South Asia.

47.3% of Romani males carry Y chromosomes of haplogroup H-M82 which is rare outside of the Indian subcontinent. Mitochondrial haplogroup M, most common in Indian subjects and rare outside Southern Asia, accounts for nearly 30% of Romani people. A more detailed study of Polish Romani shows this to be of the M5 lineage, which is specific to India. Moreover, a form of the inherited disorder congenital myasthenia is found in Romani subjects. This form of the disorder, caused by the 1267delG mutation, is otherwise only known in subjects of Indian ancestry. This is considered to be the best evidence of the Indian ancestry of the Romanies.

The Romanis have been described as &quot;a conglomerate of genetically isolated founder populations&quot;, while a number of common Mendelian disorders among Romanies from all over Europe indicates &quot;a common origin and founder effect&quot;. See also this table:

A study from 2001 by Gresham et al. suggests &quot;a limited number of related founders, compatible with a small group of migrants splitting from a distinct caste or tribal group&quot;. Also the study pointed out that &quot;genetic drift and different levels and sources of admixture, appear to have played a role in the subsequent differentiation of populations&quot;. The same study found that &quot;a single lineage ... found across Romani populations, accounts for almost one-third of Romani males. A similar preservation of a highly resolved male lineage has been reported elsewhere only for Jewish priests&quot;. See also the Cohen Modal Haplotype.

A 2004 study by Morar et al. concluded that the Romani are &quot;a founder population of common origins that has subsequently split into multiple socially divergent and geographically dispersed Gypsy groups&quot;. The same study revealed that this population &quot;was founded approximately 32–40 generations ago, with secondary and tertiary founder events occurring approximately 16–25 generations ago&quot;.

===Admixture in South Africa===
Coloureds ( or &quot;Bruinmense&quot;, lit. &quot;Brown people&quot;) are a multiracial ethnic group native to Southern Africa who have ancestry from more than one of the various populations inhabiting the region, including Khoisan, Bantu, European, Austronesian, East Asian or South Asian. Because of the combination of ethnicities, different families and individuals within a family may have a variety of different physical features. &quot;Coloured&quot; was a legally defined racial classification during apartheid.
In the Western Cape, a distinctive Cape Coloured and affiliated Cape Malay culture developed. In other parts of Southern Africa, people classified as Coloured were usually the descendants of individuals from two distinct ethnicities. Genetic studies suggest the group has the highest levels of mixed ancestry in the world. Mitochondrial DNA studies have demonstrated that the maternal lines of the Coloured population are descended mostly from African Khoisan women. This ethnicity shows a gender-biased admixture. While a plurality of male lines have come from Ngunis, Southern African, West African and East African populations, 45.2%, Western European lineages contributed 37.3% to paternal components and South Asian/ Southeast Asian lineages 17.5%.

Coloureds are to be mostly found in the western part of South Africa. In Cape Town, they form 45.4% of the total population, according to the South African National Census of 2011.

<text>In the history of cryptography, the ECM Mark II was a cipher machine used by the United States for message encryption from World War II until the 1950s. The machine was also known as the SIGABA or Converter M-134 by the Army, or CSP-888/889 by the Navy, and a modified Navy version was termed the CSP-2900.

Like many machines of the era it used an electromechanical system of rotors to encipher messages, but with a number of security improvements over previous designs. No successful cryptanalysis of the machine during its service lifetime is publicly known.

==History==
It was clear to US cryptographers well before World War II that the single-stepping mechanical motion of rotor machines (e.g. the Hebern machine) could be exploited by attackers. In the case of the famous Enigma machine, these attacks were supposed to be upset by moving the rotors to random locations at the start of each new message. This, however, proved not to be secure enough, and German Enigma messages were frequently broken by cryptanalysis during World War II.

William Friedman, director of the US Army&#x27;s Signals Intelligence Service, devised a system to correct for this attack by truly randomizing the motion of the rotors. His modification consisted of a paper tape reader from a teletype machine attached to a small device with metal &quot;feelers&quot; positioned to pass electricity through the holes. When a letter was pressed on the keyboard the signal would be sent through the rotors as it was in the Enigma, producing an encrypted version. In addition, the current would also flow through the paper tape attachment, and any holes in the tape at its current location would cause the corresponding rotor to turn, and then advance the paper tape one position. In comparison, the Enigma rotated its rotors one position with each key press, a much less random movement. The resulting design went into limited production as the M-134 Converter, and its message settings included the position of the tape and the settings of a plugboard that indicated which line of holes on the tape controlled which rotors. However, there were problems using fragile paper tapes under field conditions.

Friedman&#x27;s associate, Frank Rowlett, then came up with a different way to advance the rotors, using another set of rotors. In Rowlett&#x27;s design, each rotor must be constructed such that between one and four output signals were generated, advancing one or more of the rotors (rotors normally have one output for every input). There was little money for encryption development in the US before the war, so Friedman and Rowlett built a series of &quot;add on&quot; devices called the SIGGOO (or M-229) that were used with the existing M-134s in place of the paper tape reader. These were external boxes containing a three rotor setup in which five of the inputs were live, as if someone had pressed five keys at the same time on an Enigma, and the outputs were &quot;gathered up&quot; into five groups as well — that is all the letters from A to E would be wired together for instance. That way the five signals on the input side would be randomized through the rotors, and come out the far side with power in one of five lines. Now the movement of the rotors could be controlled with a day code, and the paper tape was eliminated. They referred to the combination of machines as the M-134-C.

In 1935 they showed their work to Joseph Wenger, a cryptographer in the OP-20-G section of the U.S. Navy. He found little interest for it in the Navy until early 1937, when he showed it to Commander Laurance Safford, Friedman&#x27;s counterpart in the Office of Naval Intelligence. He immediately saw the potential of the machine, and he and Commander Seiler then added a number of features to make the machine easier to build, resulting in the Electric Code Machine Mark II (or &quot;ECM Mark II&quot;), which the navy then produced as the CSP-889 (or 888).
Oddly, the Army was unaware of either the changes or the mass production of the system, but were &quot;let in&quot; on the secret in early 1940. In 1941 the Army and Navy joined in a joint cryptographic system, based on the machine. The Army then started using it as the SIGABA. Just over 10,000 machines were built.

On 26 June 1942, the Army and Navy agreed not to allow SIGABA machines to be placed in foreign territory except where armed American personnel were able to protect the machine. The SIGABA would be made available to another Allied country only if personnel of that country were denied direct access to the machine or its operation by an American liaison officer who would operate it.

==Description==

SIGABA was similar to the Enigma in basic theory, in that it used a series of rotors to encipher every character of the plaintext into a different character of ciphertext. Unlike Enigma&#x27;s three rotors however, the SIGABA included fifteen, and did not use a reflecting rotor.

The SIGABA had three banks of five rotors each; the action of two of the banks controlled the stepping of the third.
* The main bank of five rotors was termed the &quot;cipher rotors&quot; (Army) or &quot;alphabet maze&quot; (Navy) and each rotor had 26 contacts. This assembly acted similarly to other rotor machines, such as the Enigma; when a plaintext letter was entered, a signal would enter one side of the bank and exit the other, denoting the ciphertext letter. Unlike the Enigma, there was no reflector.
* The second bank of five rotors was termed the &quot;control rotors&quot; or &quot;stepping maze.&quot; These were also 26-contact rotors. The control rotors received four signals at each step. After passing through the control rotors, the outputs were divided into ten groups of various sizes, ranging from 1–6 wires. Each group corresponded to an input wire for the next bank of rotors.
* The third bank of rotors was called the &quot;index rotors&quot;. These rotors were smaller, with only ten contacts, and did not step during the encryption. After travelling though the index rotors, one to four of five output lines would have power. These then turned the cypher rotors.
The SIGABA advanced one or more of its main rotors in a complex, pseudorandom fashion. This meant that attacks which could break other rotor machines with simpler stepping (for example, Enigma) were made much more complex. Even with the plaintext in hand, there were so many potential inputs to the encryption that it was difficult to work out the settings.

On the downside, the SIGABA was also large, heavy, expensive, difficult to operate, mechanically complex, and fragile. It was nowhere near as practical a device as the Enigma, which was smaller and lighter than the radios with which it was used. It found widespread use in the radio rooms of US Navy ships, but as a result of these practical problems the SIGABA simply couldn&#x27;t be used in the field. In most theatres other systems were used instead, especially for tactical communications. One of the most famous was the use of Navajo code talkers for tactical field communications in the Pacific Theater. In other theatres, less secure, but smaller, lighter, and sturdier machines were used, such as the M-209. SIGABA, impressive as it was, was overkill for tactical communications. This said, new speculative evidence emerged more recently that the M-209 code was broken by German cryptanalysts during World War II.
==Operation==

Because SIGABA did not have a reflector, a 26+ pole switch was needed to change the signal paths through the alphabet maze between the encryption and decryption modes. The long “controller” switch was mounted vertically, with its knob on the top of the housing. See image. It had five positions, O, P, R, E and D. Besides encrypt (E) and decrypt (D), it had a plain text position (P) that printed whatever was typed on the output tape, and a reset position (R) that was used to set the rotors and to zeroize the machine. The O position turned the machine off. The P setting was used to print the indicators and date/time groups on the output tape. It was the only mode that printed numbers. No printing took place in the R setting, but digit keys were active to increment rotors.

During encryption, the Z key was connected to the X key and the space bar produced a Z input to the alphabet maze. A Z was printed as a space on decryption. The reader was expected to understand that a word like “xebra” in a decrypted message was actually “zebra.” The printer automatically added a space between each group of five characters during encryption.

The SIGABA was zeroized when all the index rotors read zero in their low order digit and all the alphabet and code rotors were set to the letter O. Each rotor had a cam that caused the rotor to stop in the proper position during the zeroize process.

SIGABA&#x27;s rotors were all housed in a removable frame held in place by four thumb screws. This allowed the most sensitive elements of the machine to be stored in more secure safes and to be quickly thrown overboard or otherwise destroyed if capture was threatened. It also allowed a machine to quickly switch between networks that used different rotor orders. Messages had two 5- character indicators, an exterior indicator that specified the system being used and the security classification and an interior indicator that determined the initial settings of the code and alphabet rotors. The key list included separate index rotor settings for each security classification. This prevented lower classification messages from being used as cribs to attack higher classification messages.

The Navy and Army had different procedures for the interior indicator. Both started by zeroizing the machine and having the operator select a random 5-character string for each new message. This was then encrypted to produce the interior indicator. Army key lists included an initial setting for the rotors that was used to encrypt the random string. The Navy operators used the keyboard to increment the code rotors until they matched the random character string. The alphabet rotor would move during this process and their final position was the internal indicator. In case of joint operations, the Army procedures were followed.

The key lists included a “26-30” check string. After the rotors were reordered according to the current key, the operator would zeroize the machine, encrypt 25 characters and then encrypt “AAAAA”. The ciphertext resulting from the five A&#x27;s had to match the check string. The manual warned that typographical errors were possible in key lists and that a four character match should be accepted.

The manual also gave suggestions on how to generate random strings for creating indicators. These included using playing cards and poker chips, to selecting characters from cipher texts and using the SIGABA itself as a random character generator.
==Security==

Although the SIGABA was extremely secure, the US continued to upgrade its capability throughout the war, for fear of the Axis cryptanalytic ability to break SIGABA&#x27;s code. When the German&#x27;s ENIGMA messages and Japan&#x27;s Type B Cipher Machine were broken, the messages were closely scrutinized for signs that Axis forces were able to read the US cryptography codes. Axis prisoners of war (POWs) were also interrogated with the goal of finding evidence that US cryptography had been broken. However, neither the Germans nor the Japanese were making any progress in breaking the SIGABA code. A decrypted JN-A-20 message, dated 24 January 1942, sent from the naval attaché in Berlin to vice chief of Japanese Naval General Staff in Tokyo stated that &quot;joint Jap[anese]-German cryptanalytical efforts&quot; to be &quot;highly satisfactory&quot;, since the &quot;German[s] have exhibited commendable ingenuity and recently experienced some success on English Navy systems&quot;, but are &quot;encountering difficulty in establishing successful techniques of attack on &#x27;enemy&#x27; code setup&quot;. In another decrypted JN-A-20 message, the Germans admitted that their progress in breaking US communications was unsatisfactory. The Japanese also admitted in their own communications that they had made no real progress against the American cipher system. In September 1944, when the Allies were advancing steadily on the Western front, the war diary of the German Signal Intelligence Group recorded: &quot;U.S. 5-letter traffic: Work discontinued as unprofitable at this time&quot;.

SIGABA systems were closely guarded at all times, with separate safes for the system base and the code-wheel assembly, but there was one incident where a unit was lost for a time. On February 3, 1945, a truck carrying a SIGABA system in three safes was stolen while its guards were visiting a brothel in recently liberated Colmar, France. General Eisenhower ordered an extensive search, which finally discovered the safes six weeks later in a nearby river.

==Interoperability with Allied counterparts==
The need for cooperation among US, British, and Canadian forces in carrying out joint military operations against Axis forces gave rise to the need for a cipher system that could be used by all Allied forces. This functionality was achieved in three different ways. Firstly, the ECM Adapter (CSP 1000), which could be retrofitted on Allied cipher machines, was produced at the Washington Naval Yard ECM Repair Shop. A total of 3,500 adapters were produced. The second method was to adapt the SIGABA for interoperation with a modified British machine, the Typex. The common machine was known as the Combined Cipher Machine (CCM), and was used from November 1943. Because of the high cost of production, only 631 CCMs were made. The third way was the most common and most cost-effective. It was the &quot;X&quot; Adapter manufactured by the Teletype Corporation in Chicago. A total of 4,500 of these adapters were installed at depot-level maintenance facilities.

<doc id="145040" wikidata="Q483948" url="?curid=145040" title="Conservation of mass">
<text>In physics and chemistry, the law of conservation of mass or principle of mass conservation states that for any system closed to all transfers of matter the mass of the system must remain constant over time.

The law implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed, although it may be rearranged in space, or the entities associated with it may be changed in form. For example, in chemical reactions, the mass of the chemical components before the reaction is equal to the mass of the components after the reaction. Thus, during any chemical reaction and low-energy thermodynamic processes in an isolated system, the total mass of the reactants, or starting materials, must be equal to the mass of the products.

The concept of mass conservation is widely used in many fields such as chemistry, mechanics, and fluid dynamics. Historically, mass conservation in chemical reactions was primarily demonstrated in the 17th century and finally confirmed by Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century. The formulation of this law was of crucial importance in the progress from alchemy to the modern natural science of chemistry.

In reality, the conservation of mass only holds approximately and is considered part of a series of assumptions in classical mechanics. The law has to be modified to comply with the laws of quantum mechanics and special relativity under the principle of mass–energy equivalence, which states that energy and mass form one conserved quantity. For very energetic systems the conservation of mass only is shown not to hold, as is the case in nuclear reactions and particle-antiparticle annihilation in particle physics.

Mass is also not generally conserved in open systems. Such is the case when any energy or matter is allowed into, or out of, the system. However, unless radioactivity or nuclear reactions are involved, the amount of energy entering or escaping such systems (as heat, mechanical work, or electromagnetic radiation) is usually too small to be measured as a change in the mass of the system.

For systems that include large gravitational fields, general relativity has to be taken into account; thus mass–energy conservation becomes a more complex concept, subject to different definitions, and neither mass nor energy is as strictly and simply conserved as is the case in special relativity.

== Formulation and examples ==
The law of conservation of mass can only be formulated in classical mechanics, in which the energy scales associated with an isolated system are much smaller than formula_1, where formula_2 is the mass of a typical object in the system, measured in the frame of reference where the object is at rest, and formula_3 is the speed of light.

The law can be formulated mathematically in the fields of fluid mechanics and continuum mechanics, where the conservation of mass is usually expressed using the continuity equation, given in differential form as formula_4 where formula_5 is the density (mass per unit volume), formula_6 is the time, formula_7 is the divergence, and formula_8 is the flow velocity field.

The interpretation of the continuity equation for mass is the following: For a given closed surface in the system, the change, over any time interval, of the mass enclosed by the surface is equal to the mass that traverses the surface during that time interval: positive if the matter goes in and negative if the matter goes out. For the whole isolated system, this condition implies that the total mass formula_9, the sum of the masses of all components in the system, does not change over time, i.e. formula_10 where formula_11 is the differential that defines the integral over the whole volume of the system.

The continuity equation for the mass is part of the Euler equations of fluid dynamics. Many other convection–diffusion equations describe the conservation and flow of mass and matter in a given system.

In chemistry, the calculation of the amount of reactant and products in a chemical reaction, or stoichiometry, is founded on the principle of conservation of mass. The principle implies that during a chemical reaction the total mass of the reactants is equal to the total mass of the products. For example, in the following reaction

where one molecule of methane () and two oxygen molecules are converted into one molecule of carbon dioxide () and two of water (). The number of molecules resulting from the reaction can be derived from the principle of conservation of mass, as initially four hydrogen atoms, 4 oxygen atoms and one carbon atom are present (as well as in the final state); thus the number water molecules produced must be exactly two per molecule of carbon dioxide produced.

Many engineering problems are solved by following the mass distribution of a given system over time; this methodology is known as mass balance.

==History==


As early as 520 BCE, Jain philosophy, a non-creationist philosophy based on the teachings of Mahavira, stated that the universe and its constituents such as matter cannot be destroyed or created. The Jain text Tattvarthasutra (2nd century CE) states that a substance is permanent, but its modes are characterised by creation and destruction.

An important idea in ancient Greek philosophy was that &quot;Nothing comes from nothing&quot;, so that what exists now has always existed: no new matter can come into existence where there was none before. An explicit statement of this, along with the further principle that nothing can pass away into nothing, is found in Empedocles (c.4th century BCE): &quot;For it is impossible for anything to come to be from what is not, and it cannot be brought about or heard of that what is should be utterly destroyed.&quot;

A further principle of conservation was stated by Epicurus around the 3rd century BCE, who wrote in describing the nature of the Universe that &quot;the totality of things was always such as it is now, and always will be&quot;.

===Discoveries in chemistry===
By the 18th century the principle of conservation of mass during chemical reactions was widely used and was an important assumption during experiments, even before a definition was widely established, though an expression of the law can be dated back to Hero of Alexandria’s time, as can be seen in the works of Joseph Black, Henry Cavendish, and Jean Rey. One of the first to outline the principle was Mikhail Lomonosov in 1756. He may have demonstrated it by experiments and certainly had discussed the principle in 1748 in correspondence with Leonhard Euler, though his claim on the subject is sometimes challenged. According to the Soviet physicist Yakov Dorfman:The universal law was formulated by Lomonosov on the basis of general philosophical materialistic considerations, it was never questioned or tested by him, but on the contrary, served him as a solid starting position in all research throughout his life. A more refined series of experiments were later carried out by Antoine Lavoisier who expressed his conclusion in 1773 and popularized the principle of conservation of mass. The demonstrations of the principle disproved the then popular phlogiston theory that said that mass could be gained or lost in combustion and heat processes.

The conservation of mass was obscure for millennia because of the buoyancy effect of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere on the weight of gases. For example, a piece of wood weighs less after burning; this seemed to suggest that some of its mass disappears, or is transformed or lost. Careful experiments were performed in which chemical reactions such as rusting were allowed to take place in sealed glass ampoules; it was found that the chemical reaction did not change the weight of the sealed container and its contents. Weighing of gases using scales was not possible until the invention of the vacuum pump in the 17th century.

Once understood, the conservation of mass was of great importance in progressing from alchemy to modern chemistry. Once early chemists realized that chemical substances never disappeared but were only transformed into other substances with the same weight, these scientists could for the first time embark on quantitative studies of the transformations of substances. The idea of mass conservation plus a surmise that certain &quot;elemental substances&quot; also could not be transformed into others by chemical reactions, in turn led to an understanding of chemical elements, as well as the idea that all chemical processes and transformations (such as burning and metabolic reactions) are reactions between invariant amounts or weights of these chemical elements.

Following the pioneering work of Lavoisier, the exhaustive experiments of Jean Stas supported the consistency of this law in chemical reactions, even though they were carried out with other intentions. His research indicated that in certain reactions the loss or gain could not have been more than 2 to 4 parts in 100,000. The difference in the accuracy aimed at and attained by Lavoisier on the one hand, and by Edward W. Morley and Stas on the other, is enormous.

=== Modern physics ===
The law of conservation of mass was challenged with the advent of special relativity. In one of the Annus Mirabilis papers of Albert Einstein in 1905, he suggested an equivalence between mass and energy. This theory implied several assertions, like the idea that internal energy of a system could contribute to the mass of the whole system, or that mass could be converted into electromagnetic radiation. However, as Max Planck pointed out, a change in mass as a result of extraction or addition of chemical energy, as predicted by Einstein&#x27;s theory, is so small that it could not be measured with the available instruments and could not be presented as a test of special relativity. Einstein speculated that the energies associated with newly discovered radioactivity were significant enough, compared with the mass of systems producing them, to enable their change of mass to be measured, once the energy of the reaction had been removed from the system. This later indeed proved to be possible, although it was eventually to be the first artificial nuclear transmutation reaction in 1932, demonstrated by Cockcroft and Walton, that proved the first successful test of Einstein&#x27;s theory regarding mass loss with energy gain.

The law of conservation of mass and the analogous law of conservation of energy were finally generalized and unified into the principle of mass–energy equivalence, described by Albert Einstein&#x27;s equation formula_12. Special relativity also redefines the concept of mass and energy, which can be used interchangeably and are defined relative to the frame of reference. Several quantities had to be defined for consistency, such as the &quot;rest mass&quot; of a particle (mass in the rest frame of the particle) and the &quot;relativistic mass&quot; (in another frame). The latter term is usually less frequently used.

In general relativity, conservation of both mass and energy is not globally conserved and its definition is more complicated.

<doc id="145042" wikidata="Q200514" url="?curid=145042" title="Frank Morgan">
<text>Francis Phillip Wuppermann (June 1, 1890 – September 18, 1949), known professionally as Frank Morgan, was an American character actor. He was best known for his appearances in films starting in the silent era in 1916, and then numerous sound films throughout the 1930s and 1940s, with a career spanning 35 years mostly as a contract player at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He is best-known for his multiple roles, including the title role of The Wizard in the 1939 MGM film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. He was also briefly billed early in his career as Frank Wupperman and Francis Morgan.

==Early life==
Morgan was born on June 1, 1890, in New York City, to Josephine Wright (née Hancox) and George Diogracia Wuppermann. He was the youngest of 11 children and had five brothers and five sisters. The elder Mr. Wuppermann was born in Venezuela but was brought up in Hamburg, Germany, and was of German and Spanish ancestry. His mother was born in the United States, of English ancestry. His brother Ralph Morgan was also an actor of stage and screen. The family earned their wealth distributing Angostura bitters, allowing Wuppermann to attend Cornell University, where he was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and the Glee Club.

==Career==

=== Theater ===
Morgan began his acting career in theater. An aspiring vaudevillian following in his brother&#x27;s footsteps, he changed his name from Wuppermann to Morgan. He made his acting debut in the show Mr. Wu on October 14, 1914. After many years of starring in theater productions, he finally caught the attention of critics with his role as Count Carlo Boretti in &quot;The Lullaby&quot; alongside Florence Reed. In 1927, he played Henry Spoffard in &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;. Three years later, Morgan played what he considered to be one of his best roles in &quot;Topaze&quot;. 

Morgan&#x27;s theatrical career ended shortly after he began his contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. His last two shows were &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; and &quot;Hey Nonny Nonny!&quot;.

===Film===
From 1916 to 1936, Morgan starred in several silent films. He made his debut as Sir Richard in &quot;The Suspect&quot; (1916). Following that, he starred in &quot;Raffles, the Amateur Cracksman&quot; (1917) as Bunny Manders, alongside costar John Barrymore. He also starred in the propaganda film, &quot;Who&#x27;s Your Neighbor?&quot;, along with others such as, &quot;At the Mercy of Men&quot;, &quot;Manhandled (1924 film)&quot;, &quot;Born Rich (1924 film)&quot;, and other roles in small films. 

After signing onto a contract with MGM, Morgan starred with Al Jolson in &quot;Hallelujah, I&#x27;m a Bum (film)&quot; in 1933. In 1934, Morgan received an Academy Award nomination for Best Leading Actor for his performance as Alessandro, Duke of Florence. In the next year, he starred in &quot;The Good Fairy (1935 film)&quot;. He also starred as Jack Billings in &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot;. In 1936, Morgan played alongside Shirley Temple as Professor Appleby in &quot;Dimples&quot;. Speaking about Morgan, Temple wrote, &quot; . . Dimples pitted me against an accomplished veteran of the legitimate stage who was not about to let any little curly headed kid steal his scenes. Competition for camera attention had always been a fact of life for me. The kid and the expert could not help but collide.&quot; 

In &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939), Morgan played five roles: the Wizard, the carnival huckster &quot;Professor Marvel&quot;, the &quot;bust my buttons&quot; Gatekeeper (who initially refuses to let Dorothy and her friends into the city), the &quot;horse of a different color&quot; carriage driver of Emerald City, and the Palace Guard (who refuses to let Dorothy and her friends in to see the Wizard). Morgan was cast in the role on September 22, 1938. W. C. Fields was originally chosen for the part of the Wizard, but the studio ran out of patience after protracted haggling over his fee. 

An actor with a wide range, Morgan was equally effective playing comical, befuddled men such as Jesse Kiffmeyer in &quot;Saratoga&quot; (1937) and Mr. Ferris in &quot;Casanova Brown&quot; (1944), as he was with more serious, troubled characters like Hugo Matuschek in &quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot; (1940), Professor Roth in &quot;The Mortal Storm&quot; (1940) and Willie Grogan in &quot;The Human Comedy&quot; (1943). MGM&#x27;s musical comedy film &quot;The Great Morgan&quot; (1946), is a compilation film featuring Frank Morgan supposedly as himself but playing the familiar bumbler. Occasionally a co-star (as in &quot;The Human Comedy&quot;, and, once established, invariably a featured player), he also saw the occasional lead deep in his Hollywood career, as the philanthropic tycoon falsely accused of murder in 1941&#x27;s &quot;Washington Melodrama&quot; and &quot;The Great Morgan&quot; (in which he is the Morgan of the title, the picture&#x27;s central player).

During the 1940s, Morgan appeared in such diverse genres and roles as an oil wildcatter in &quot;Boom Town&quot; (supporting Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, and Claudette Colbert); &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot; in 1942 (based on the John Steinbeck book, again supporting Tracy); a jungle doctor in &quot;White Cargo&quot; (supporting Walter Pidgeon and Hedy Lamarr); a shepherd in the &quot;Courage of Lassie&quot; in 1946; a doctor again in &quot;Green Dolphin Street&quot; in 1948 in support of Lana Turner, Van Heflin, and Donna Reed; King Louis XIII in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; in 1948, supporting Gene Kelly and Turner again; and as Jimmy Stewart’s boss in &quot;The Stratton Story&quot; in 1949. He played a fire chief in his final picture, &quot;Key to the City&quot;, filmed in 1949 but released posthumously in 1950.

===Radio===
Morgan also had a career in radio. In the 1940s, Morgan co-starred with Fanny Brice in one version (of several different series) of the radio program &quot;Maxwell House Coffee Time&quot;, aka &quot;The Frank Morgan-Fanny Brice Show&quot;. During the first half of the show Morgan would tell increasingly outlandish tall tales about his life adventures, much to the dismay of his fellow cast members. After the Morgan segment there was a song, followed by Brice as &#x27;Baby Snooks&#x27; for the last half of the show. When Brice left to star in her own program in 1944, Morgan continued solo for a year with &quot;The Frank Morgan Show&quot;. In 1947, Morgan starred as the title character in the radio series &quot;The Fabulous Dr. Tweedy&quot;. He also recorded a number of children&#x27;s records, including the popular Gossamer Wump, released in 1949 by Capitol Records.

==Personal life and death==
Morgan married Alma Muller in 1914; they had one son, George. They were married until his death in 1949. 

Morgan was widely known to be an alcoholic, according to several people who worked with him, including Margaret Hamilton and Aljean Harmetz. Morgan sometimes carried a black briefcase to work, fully equipped with a small mini-bar.

Morgan&#x27;s niece Claudia Morgan (née Wuppermann) was a stage and film actress, and his brother was playwright Carlos Wuppermann.

Morgan had filmed a few scenes as Buffalo Bill in the musical &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; (1950) when he died suddenly of a heart attack on September 18, 1949, at the age of 59. He was replaced in the film by Louis Calhern. Morgan is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. His tombstone carries his real name, Wuppermann, as well as his stage name.

==Awards and honors==
Morgan was nominated for two Academy Awards, one for Best Actor in &quot;The Affairs of Cellini&quot; (1934) and one for Best Supporting Actor in &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot; (1942). He has two stars dedicated to him on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Hollywood, California: one for his films at 1708 Vine Street and one for his work in radio at 6700 Hollywood Boulevard. Both were dedicated on February 8, 1960.

<doc id="145043" wikidata="Q1411242" url="?curid=145043" title="Vice">
<text>A vice is a practice, behaviour, or habit generally considered morally wrong in the associated society. In more minor usage, vice can refer to a fault, a negative character trait, a defect, an infirmity, or a bad or unhealthy habit. Vices are usually associated with a fault in a person&#x27;s character or temperament rather than their morality. 

Synonyms for vice include fault, sin, depravity, iniquity, wickedness, and corruption. The antonym of vice is virtue.

==Etymology==
The modern English term that best captures its original meaning is the word &quot;vicious&quot;, which means &quot;full of vice&quot;. In this sense, the word &quot;vice&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;vitium&quot;, meaning &quot;failing or defect&quot;.

== Law enforcement ==
Depending on the country or jurisdiction, vice crimes may or may not be treated as a separate category in the criminal codes. Even in jurisdictions where vice is not explicitly delineated in the legal code, the term &quot;vice&quot; is often used in law enforcement and judicial systems as an umbrella term for crimes involving activities that are considered inherently immoral, regardless of the legality or objective harm involved.

In the United Kingdom, the term &quot;vice&quot; is commonly used in law and law enforcement to refer to criminal offences related to prostitution and pornography. In the United States, the term is also used to refer to crimes related to drugs, alcohol, and gambling.

===Vice squad===


A vice squad, also called a vice unit or a morality squad, is generally, though not always, a police division, whose focus is to restrain or suppress moral crimes. Though what is considered or accepted as a moral crime by society often varies considerably according to local laws or customs between nations, countries, or states, it often includes activities such as gambling, narcotics, prostitution and pornography.

== Religion ==
Religious police, for example Islamic religious police units or sharia police in certain Muslim countries, are morality squads that also monitor, for example, dress codes, observance of store-closures during prayer time, consumption of unlawful beverages or foods, unrelated males and females socializing, and homosexual behaviour.

=== Buddhism ===

In the Sarvastivadin tradition of Buddhism, there are 108 defilements, or vices, which are prohibited. These are subdivided into 10 bonds and 98 proclivities. The 10 bonds are the following:
* Absence of shame
* Absence of embarrassment
* Jealousy
* Parsimony (in the sense of stinginess)
* Remorse
* Drowsiness
* Distraction
* Torpor
* Anger
* Concealment of wrongdoing

=== Judaism ===

Avoiding vice is an important theme in Jewish ethics, especially within musar literature.

=== Christianity ===


Christians believe there are two kinds of vice:
* Vices that come from the physical organism as instincts, which can become perverse (such as lust)
* Vices that come from false idolatry in the spiritual realm

The first kind of vice, though sinful, is believed less serious than the second. Vices recognized as spiritual by Christians include blasphemy (holiness betrayed), apostasy (faith betrayed), despair (hope betrayed), hatred (love betrayed), and indifference (scripturally, a &quot;hardened heart&quot;). Christian theologians have reasoned that the most destructive vice equates to a certain type of pride or the complete idolatry of the self. It is argued that through this vice, which is essentially competitive, all the worst evils come into being. In Christian theology, it originally led to the Fall of Man, and, as a purely diabolical spiritual vice, it outweighs anything else often condemned by the Church.

==== Roman Catholicism ====
The Roman Catholic Church distinguishes between vice, which is a habit of sin, and the sin itself, which is an individual morally wrong act. In Roman Catholicism, the word &quot;sin&quot; also refers to the state that befalls one upon committing a morally wrong act. In this section, the word always means the sinful act. It is the sin, and not the vice, that deprives one of God&#x27;s sanctifying grace and renders one deserving of God&#x27;s punishment. Thomas Aquinas taught that &quot;absolutely speaking, the sin surpasses the vice in wickedness&quot;. On the other hand, even after a person&#x27;s sins have been forgiven, the underlying habit (the vice) may remain. Just as vice was created in the first place by repeatedly yielding to the temptation to sin, so vice may be removed only by repeatedly resisting temptation and performing virtuous acts; the more entrenched the vice, the more time and effort needed to remove it. Saint Thomas Aquinas says that following rehabilitation and the acquisition of virtues, the vice does not persist as a habit, but rather as a mere disposition and one that is in the process of being eliminated. Medieval illuminated manuscripts circulated with colorful schemas for developing proper attitudes, with scriptural allusions modelled on nature: the tree of virtues as blossoming flowers or vices bearing sterile fruit, The Renaissance writer Pietro Bembo is credited with reaffirming and promoting the Christian perfection of classical humanism. Deriving all from love (or the lack thereof) his schemas were added as supplements in the newly invented technology of printing by Aldus Manutius in his editions of Dante&#x27;s Divine Comedy dating from early in the 16th century.

=== Dante&#x27;s seven deadly vices ===

The poet Dante Alighieri listed the following seven deadly vices, associating them structurally as flaws in the soul&#x27;s inherent capacity for goodness as made in the Divine Image yet perverted by the Fall:

#Pride or vanity: an excessive love of the self (holding the self outside of its proper position regarding God or fellows; Dante&#x27;s definition was &quot;love of self perverted to hatred and contempt for one&#x27;s neighbour&quot;). In the Latin lists of the Seven Deadly Sins, pride is referred to as &quot;superbia&quot;.
#Envy or jealousy: resentment of others for their possessions (Dante: &quot;love of one&#x27;s own good perverted to a desire to deprive other men of theirs&quot;). In the Latin lists of the Seven Deadly Sins, envy is referred to as &quot;invidia&quot;.
#Wrath or anger: feelings of hatred, revenge or denial, as well as punitive desires outside of justice (Dante&#x27;s description was &quot;love of justice perverted to revenge and spite&quot;). In the Latin lists of the Seven Deadly Sins, wrath is referred to as &quot;ira&quot;, which primitive vices tempt astray by increasingly perverting the proper purpose of charity, directing it inwards, leading to a disordered navel-gazing preoccupation with personal goods in isolation absent proper harmonious relations leading to violent disruption of balance with others.
#Sloth or laziness: idleness and wastefulness of time or other allotted resources. Laziness is condemned because it results in others having to work harder; also, useful work will not be done. Sloth is referred to in Latin as &quot;accidie&quot; or &quot;acedia&quot;, which vice tempts a self-aware soul to be too easily satisfied, thwarting charity&#x27;s purpose as insufficiently perceptible within the soul itself or abjectly indifferent in relationship with the needs of others and their satisfaction, an escalation in evil, more odious than the passion of hate
#Avarice (covetousness, greed): a desire to possess more than one has need or use for (or according to Dante, &quot;excessive love of money and power&quot;). In the Latin lists of the Seven Deadly Sins, avarice is referred to as &quot;avaritia&quot;.
#Gluttony: overindulgence in food, drink or intoxicants, or misplaced desire of food as a pleasure for its sensuality (&quot;excessive love of pleasure&quot; was Dante&#x27;s rendering). In the Latin lists of the Seven Deadly Sins, gluttony is referred to as &quot;gula&quot;.
#Lust: excessive sexual desire. Dante&#x27;s criterion was that &quot;lust detracts from true love&quot;. In the Latin lists of the Seven Deadly Sins, lust is referred to as &quot;luxuria&quot;, which vices tempt cultivated souls in their ability to direct charity&#x27;s proper purpose to good things or actions, by indulging excess. Thus in Dante&#x27;s estimation, the soul&#x27;s detachment from sensual appetites become the vices most difficult to tame, urges not as easily curbed by mere good manners since inflamed via appropriate use rather than inappropriate misuse. Hence conventional respect for the ninth and tenth commandments against coveting and social customs that encourage custody of the eyes and ears become prudent adjuncts to training against vice.
The first three terraces of purgatory expiate the sins which can be considered to arise from love perverted, that is, sins which arise from the heart of the sinner being set upon something which is wrong in the eyes of God. Those being purged here must have their love set upon the right path. The fourth terrace of purgatory expiates the sins which can be considered to arise from love defective, that is, love which, although directed towards the correct subjects is too weak to drive the sinner to act as they should. Those being purged here must have their love strengthened so as to drive them correctly. The fifth, sixth, and seventh terraces of purgatory expiate the sins which can be considered to arise from love excessive, that is, love which although directed towards ends which God considers good is directed towards them too much for the sinner to gain bliss from them, and also so that the sinner is distracted from the love of other things of which God approves. Their love must be cooled to a more sensible level.

=== Islam ===

The Qur&#x27;an and many other Islamic religious writings provide prohibitions against acts that are seen as immoral.

Ibn abi Dunya, a 9th-century scholar and tutor to the caliphs, described 6 &quot;censures&quot; (prohibitions against vices) in his writings:
* Ire
* Envy
* Slander
* Obscenity
* Intoxicants
* Instruments of pleasure

=== Epicureanism ===

Although not strictly a religion but a Hellenistic philosophy, Epicurean ethics prescribes a therapeutic approach to the vices with the goal of attaining a life of pleasure with the aid of the virtues. Most of the techniques used in Epicureanism involve challenging false beliefs and attaining beliefs that are aligned with nature. In this, Epicureanism posits an entirely naturalistic, non-religious theory of virtue and vice based on the rational pursuit of pleasure.

<text>The Affairs of Cellini is a 1934 American historical comedy film directed by Gregory La Cava and starring Frank Morgan, Constance Bennett, Fredric March, Fay Wray, and Louis Calhern. It is set in Florence. The film was adapted by Bess Meredyth from the play &quot;The Firebrand of Florence&quot; by Edwin Justus Mayer.

==Plot==
Both the duke and duchess have an eye for beauty and other partners. The duke presently fancies a young woman who poses as an artist&#x27;s model. The duchess has her eye on the famous artist, Benvenuto Cellini, who is in the palace making a set of gold plates to be used at ducal banquets. Cellini purportedly hypnotizes young women, and cuckolds the duke of Florence. The somewhat oblivious duke is loath to punish the young man because Cellini fashions gold wares for him, but throws him into the torture chamber. However, a goblet of poisoned wine solves the problem.

==Cast==
* Constance Bennett as Duchess of Florence
* Fredric March as Benvenuto Cellini
* Frank Morgan as Alessandro, Duke of Florence
* Fay Wray as Angela
* Vince Barnett as Ascanio
* Jessie Ralph as Beatrice
* Louis Calhern as Ottaviano
* Jay Eaton as Polverino
* Paul Harvey as Emissary
* Jack Rutherford as Captain of the Guards
* Irene Ware as Daughter of the Royal House of Bocci

==Reception==
Morgan was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. It was also nominated for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography and Best Sound, Recording (Thomas T. Moulton).

The film was a box-office disappointment for United Artists.

The film would later be discussed on the seventh episode of The Snub Club where it was heavily criticized.

==MPPDA/MPAA production code of 1934 to 1968==
During production and distribution of the movie, MPPDA&#x27;s production code took effect on every major film studio like Warner Bros. or the Walt Disney Productions. Fox Film Corporation had the first film with the MPPDA production code era with &quot;The World Moves On&quot;, released on June 28, 1934.

<text>Pierre Paul Broca (, , , ; 28 June 1824 – 9 July 1880) was a French physician, anatomist and anthropologist. He is best known for his research on Broca&#x27;s area, a region of the frontal lobe that is named after him. Broca&#x27;s area is involved with language. His work revealed that the brains of patients with aphasia contained lesions in a particular part of the cortex, in the left frontal region. This was the first anatomical proof of localization of brain function. 

Broca&#x27;s work contributed to the development of physical anthropology, advancing the science of anthropometry, and craniometry, in particular, the now-discredited practice of determining intelligence. He was engaged in comparative anatomy of primates and humans and proposed that Negroes were an intermediate form between apes and Europeans. He saw each racial group as its own species and believed racial mixing eventually led to sterility.

==Biography==
Paul Broca was born on 28 June 1824 in Sainte-Foy-la-Grande, Bordeaux, France, the son of Jean Pierre &quot;Benjamin&quot; Broca, a medical practitioner and former surgeon in Napoleon&#x27;s service, and Annette Thomas, well-educated daughter of a Calvinist, Reformed Protestant, preacher. Huguenot Broca received basic education in the school in his hometown, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree at the age of 16. He entered medical school in Paris when he was 17, and graduated at 20, when most of his contemporaries were just beginning as medical students.

After graduating, Broca undertook an extensive internship, first with the urologist and dermatologist Philippe Ricord (1800–1889) at the Hôpital du Midi, then in 1844 with the psychiatrist François Leuret (1797–1851) at the Bicêtre Hospital. In 1845, he became an intern with Pierre Nicolas Gerdy (1797–1856), a great anatomist and surgeon. After two years with Gerdy, Broca became his assistant. In 1848, Broca became the Prosector, performing dissections for lectures of anatomy, at the University of Paris Medical School. In 1849, he was awarded a medical doctorate. In 1853, Broca became professor agrégé, and was appointed surgeon of the hospital. He was elected to the chair of external pathology at the Faculty of Medicine in 1867, and one year later professor of clinical surgery. In 1868, he was elected a member of the Académie de medicine, and appointed the Chair of clinical surgery. He served in this capacity until his death. He also worked for the Hôpital St. Antoine, the Pitié, the Hôtel des Clinques, and the Hôpital Necker.

As a researcher, Broca joined the &quot;Society Anatomique&quot; &quot;de Paris&quot; in 1847. During his first six years in the society, Broca was its most productive contributor. Two months after joining, he was on the society&#x27;s journal editorial committee. He became its secretary and then vice president by 1851. Soon after its creation in 1848, Broca joined the &quot;Société de Biologie.&quot; He also joined and in 1865 became the president of the &quot;Societe de Chirurgie (Surgery).&quot;

In parallel with his medical career, in 1848 Broca founded a society of free-thinkers, sympathetic to Charles Darwin&#x27;s theories. He once remarked, &quot;I would rather be a transformed ape than a degenerate son of Adam&quot;. This brought him into conflict with the church, which regarded him as a subversive materialist and a corrupter of the youth. The church&#x27;s animosity toward him continued throughout his lifetime, resulting in numerous confrontations between Broca and the ecclesiastical authorities.

In 1857, feeling pressured by others, and especially his mother, Broca married Adele Augustine Lugol. She came from a Protestant family and was the daughter of prominent physician Jean Guillaume Auguste Lugol. The Brocas had three children: daughter Jeanne Francoise Pauline (1858–1935), son Benjamin Auguste (1859–1924), and son Élie André (1863–1925). One year later, Broca&#x27;s mother died and his father, Benjamin, came to Paris to live with the family until his death in 1877.

In 1858, Paul Broca was elected as member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. In 1859, he founded the Society of Anthropology of Paris. In 1872, he founded the journal Revue d&#x27;anthropologie, and in 1876, the Institute of Anthropology. The French Church opposed the development of anthropology, and in 1876 organized a campaign to stop the teaching of the subject in the Anthropological Institute. In 1872, Broca was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

Near the end of his life, Paul Broca was elected a senator for life, a permanent position in the French senate. He was also a member of the Académie française and held honorary degrees from many learned institutions, both in France and abroad. He died of a brain hemorrhage on 9 July 1880, at the age of 56. During his life he was an atheist and identified as a Liberal. His wife died in 1914 when she was 79. Like their father, Auguste and Andre went on to study medicine. Auguste Broca became a professor of pediatric surgery, now known for his contribution to the Broca-Perthes-Blankart operation, while André became a professor of medical optics and is known for developing the Pellin-Broca prism.

== Early work ==

Since the 1600s, the majority of medical advancements emerged through interaction in independent and sometimes secret societies. The &quot;Society Anatomique&quot; &quot;de Paris&quot; met every Friday and was chaired by anatomist Jean Cruveilhier, and interned by &quot;the Father of French neurology&quot; Jean-Martin Charcot; both of whom were instrumental in the later discovery of multiple sclerosis. At its meetings, members would make presentations regarding their scientific findings, which would then be published in the regular bulletin of the society&#x27;s activities.

Like Cruveilhier and Charcot, Broca made regular &quot;Society Anatomique&quot; presentations on musculoskeletal disorders. He demonstrated that rickets, a disorder that results in weak or soft bones in children, was caused by an interference with ossification due to disruption of nutrition. In their work on osteoarthritis, a form of arthritis, Broca and Amédée Deville, Broca showed that, like nails and teeth, cartilage is a tissue that requires absorption of nutrients from nearby blood vessels, and described in detail, the process that lead to degeneration of cartilage in joints. Broca also made regular presentations on the clubfoot disorder, a birth defect where infants feet are rotated inwards at birth. At the time Broca saw degeneration of muscle tissue as an explanation for this condition, and while the root cause of it is still undetermined, Broca&#x27;s theory of the muscle degeneration would lead to understanding the pathology of muscular dystrophy. As an anatomist, Broca can be considered as making 250 separate contributions to medical science.

As a surgeon, Broca wrote a detailed review on recently discovered use of chloroform as anesthesia, as well as on his own experiences of using novel pain managing methods during surgery, such as hypnosis and carbon dioxide as a local anesthetics. Broca used hypnosis during surgical removal of an abscess and received mixed results, as the patient felt pain at the beginning which then went away, and she could not remember anything afterwards. Because, of inconsistent results reported by other doctors, Broca did not repeat in using hypnosis as an anesthetic. Because of his patient&#x27;s memory loss, he saw the most potential in using it as a psychological tool. In 1856, Broca published &quot;On Aneurysms and their Treatment,&quot; a detailed, almost a thousand page long review of all accessible records on diagnosis and surgical and non treatment for these weakened blood vessels conditions. This book was one of the first published monograms on a specific subject. Before his later achievements, it was this work, that Broca was known for by other French doctors.

In 1857, Broca contributed to Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard&#x27;s work on the nervous system, conducting vivisection experiments, where specific spinal nerves were cut to demonstrate the spinal pathways for sensory and motor systems. As a result of this work. Brown-Séquard became known for demonstrating the principle of decussation, where a vertebrate&#x27;s neural fibers cross from one lateral side to another, resulting in phenomenon of the right side of that animals brain controlling the left side of the other.

As a scientist, Broca also developed theories and made hypotheses that would eventually be disproven. Based on reported findings, for example, he published work in support of viewing syphilis as a virus. When western medicine discovered the qualities of the muscle relaxant curare, used by South American Indian hunters as poison, Broca thought there was strong support for the incorrect idea that, aside from being applied topically, curare could also be diluted and ingested to counter tetanus that caused muscle spasms.

Broca also spent many of his earlier years researching cancer. His wife had a known family history of carcinoma, and it is possible that this piqued his interest in exploring possible hereditary causes of cancer. In his investigations, he accumulated evidence supporting the hereditary nature of some cancers while also discovering that cancer cells can run through the blood. Many scientists were skeptical of Broca&#x27;s hereditary hypothesis, with most believing that it is merely coincidental. He stated two hypotheses for the cause of cancer, diathesis and infection. He believed that the cause may lie somewhere between the two. He then hypothesized that (1) diathesis produces the first cancer (2) cancer produces infection, and (3) infection produces secondary multiple tumors, cachexia, and death.&quot;

==Anthropology==
Broca spent much time at his Anthropological Institute studying skulls and bones. It has been argued that he was attempting to use the measurements obtained by these studies as his main criteria for ranking racial groups in order of superiority. In that sense, Broca was a pioneer in the study of physical anthropology a part of which has been called &#x27;scientific racism.&#x27; He advanced the science of cranial anthropometry by developing many new types of measuring instruments (craniometers) and numerical indices. He published around 223 papers on general anthropology, physical anthropology, ethnology, and other branches of this field. He founded the &quot;Société d&#x27;Anthropologie de Paris&quot; in 1859, the &quot;Revue d&#x27;Anthropologie&quot; in 1872,

Broca first became acquainted with anthropology through the works of Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, Antoine Étienne Reynaud Augustin Serres and Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau, and by the late 1850s it became his lifetime interest. Broca defined Anthropology as &quot;the study of the human group, considered as whole.&quot; Like other scientists, he rejected relying on religious texts, and looked for a scientific explanation of human origins.

In 1857, Broca was presented with a hybrid leporid, a result of a cross species reproduction between a rabbit and hare. The crossbreeding was done for commercial rather than scientific reasons, as the resulting hybrids became very popular pets. Specific circumstances had to be set up in order for differently behaving species to reproduce and for their hybrid descendants to be able to reproduce between themselves. To Broca, the fact that different animals are able to intermix and create fertile offspring did not prove that they were of the same species.

In 1858, Broca presented these findings on leporids to the &quot;Société de Biologie.&quot; He believed that the key element of his work was its implication that physical differences between human races could be explained by them being different species with different origins rather than the single moment of creation. While Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; did not come out until the following year, the topic of human origin was already widely discussed in science, but still capable of producing a negative response from the government. Because of that worry, Pierre Rayer the president of the Société, along with other members with which Broca was on good relations, asked Broca to stop further discussion of the topic. Broca agreed, but was adamant for the discussion to continue, so in 1859 he formed the Société d&#x27;Anthropologie.

=== Racial groups and human species ===
As a proponent of polygenism, Broca rejected the monogenistic approach that all humans have a common ancestor. Instead he viewed human racial groups as coming from different origins. Like most of the proponents on either side, he viewed each racial group as having a place on a &#x27;barbarism&#x27; to &#x27;civilization&#x27; progression. He saw European colonization of other territories as justified by its being an attempt to civilize the barbaric populations. In his 1859 work &quot;On the Phenomenon of Hybridity in the Genus Homo&quot;, he argued that it was reasonable to view humanity as composed of independent racial groups – such as Australian, Caucasian, Mongolian, Malayan, Ethiopian, and American. He saw each racial group as its own species, connected to a geographic location. All together, these different species were part of the single genus homo. Per the standard of the time, Broca would also refer to the Caucasian racial group as white, and to the Ethiopian racial group as Negro. In his writings, Broca&#x27;s use of the word &quot;race&quot; was narrower than how it is used today. Broca considered Celts, Gauls, Greeks, Persians and Arabs to be distinct races that were part of the Caucasian racial group. Races within each group had specific physical characteristics that distinguished them from other racial groups. Like his work in anatomy, Broca emphasized that his conclusions rested on empirical evidence, rather than &quot;a priori&quot; reasoning. He thought that the distinct geographic location of each racial group was one of the main problems with the monogenists argument for common ancestry: Broca also felt that there was not enough evidence for the theory that appearance of different races could be changed by the qualities of the environments that they lived in. Broca saw the physical characteristic of Jews being the same as those portrayed in the Egyptian paintings from the 2,500 b.c., even though, by 1850 A.D. that population had spread to different locations with vastly different environments. He pointed out that his opponents were unable to provide similar long-term comparisons.

==== Hybridity ====
Broca, influenced by previous work of Samuel George Morton, used the concept of hybridity as his primary argument against monogenism, and that it was flawed to see all of humanity as a single species. Different racial groups&#x27; ability to reproduce with each was not sufficient to prove that idea. Under Broca&#x27;s view on hybridity, the result of a reproduction between two different races could fall into four categories: 1) The resulting offspring are infertile; 2) Where the resulting offspring are infertile when they reproduce between themselves but are sometimes successful when they reproduce with the parent groups; 3) Known as paragenesic, where the offspring&#x27;s descendants are able reproduce within themselves and with parents, but the success of the reproduction lowers with every generation until it ends; and 4) Known as eugenesic, where a successful reproduction can continue indefinitely, between the intermix descendants and with the parent group.

Looking at historical population figures, Broca concluded that the population of France was an example of a eugenesic mixed race, resulting from intermixing of Cimbri, Celtic, Germanic and Northern races within the Caucasian group. On the other hand, the thought that observations and population data from different regions of Africa, Southeast Asia, and North and South America, showed a significant decrease in physical and intellectual abilities of mixed groups when compared to the different races that they originated from. Concluding that intermixed descendants of different racial groups could only be Paragenesic.
&quot;On the Phenomenon of Hybridity&quot; was published the same year as Darwin&#x27;s presentation of the theory of evolution in the &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;. At that time, Broca thought of each racial group was independently created by nature. He was against slavery and disturbed by extinction of native populations caused by colonization. Broca thought that monogenism was often used to justify such actions, when it was argued that, if all races were of a single origin then &quot;the lower status of non-Caucasians&quot; was caused by how their race acted following creation. He wrote: 

==== Craniometry ====

Broca is known for making contributions towards anthropometry—the scientific approach to measurements of human physical features. He developed numerous instruments and data points that were the basis of current methods of medical and archeological craniometry. Specifically, cranial points like glabella and inion and instruments like craniograph and stereograph. Unlike Morton, who believed that a subject&#x27;s brain size was the main indicator of intelligence, Broca thought that there were other factors that were more important. These included prognathic facial angles, with closer to right angles indicating higher intelligence, and the cephalic index relationship between the brain&#x27;s length and width, that was directly proportional with intelligence, with the most intelligent European group being &#x27;long headed&#x27;, while the least intelligent Negro group being &#x27;short headed&#x27;. He thought that the most important aspect, was the relative size between the frontal and rear areas of the brain, with Caucasians having a larger frontal area than Negroes. Broca eventually came to the conclusion that larger skulls were not associated with higher intelligence, but still believed brain size was important in some aspects such as social progress, material security, and education. He compared cranial capacity of different types of Parisian skulls. In doing so he found that the average oldest Parisian skull was smaller than a modern, wealthier Parisian skull and that both were bigger than the average skull from a poor Parisian&#x27;s grave. Aside from his approaches to craniometry, Broca made other contributions to anthropometry, such as developing field work scales and measuring techniques for classifying eye, skin, and hair color, designed to resist water and sunlight damage.

=== Evolution ===
In 1861 Broca published &quot;On the Phenomenon of Hybridity&quot; two years after Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; was published. Broca accepted evolution as one of the main elements of a broader explanation for diversification of species: &quot;I am one of those who do not think that Charles Darwin has discovered the true agents of organic evolution; on the other hand I am not one of those who fail to recognize the greatness of his work ... Vital competition ... is a law; the resultant selection is a fact; individual variation, another fact.&quot;

He came to reject polygenism as applied to humans, conceding that all races were of single origin. In 1866, after the discovery of a chinless and protruded Neanderthal jaw, he wrote: &quot;I have already had occasion to state that I am not a Darwinist ... Yet I do not hesitate ... to call this the first link in the chain which, according to the Darwinists, extends from man to ape...&quot; He saw some differences between groups of animals as too distinct to be explained through evolution from a single source: Even on a narrower level Broca saw evolution as insufficient explanation for the presence of some traits:Ultimately, Broca believed that there had to be a process that ran parallel to evolution, to fully explain the origins of, and divergences, between different species.

== Language ==

=== Broca&#x27;s area ===

Broca is most well known for his theory that the speech production center of the brain is located on the left side of the brain, and for pinpointing the location to the ventroposterior region of the frontal lobes (now known as Broca&#x27;s area). He arrived at this discovery by studying the brains of aphasic patients –persons with speech and language disorders resulting from brain injuries.

This area of study began for Broca with the dispute between the proponents of cerebral localization – whose views derived from the phrenology of Franz Joseph Gall – and their opponents led by Pierre Flourens. Phrenologists believed that the human mind has a set of various mental faculties, each one represented in a different area of the brain. In this framework, specific areas may represent personality characteristics like one&#x27;s aggressiveness or spirituality, or functions like memory and linguistic abilities. Their opponents claimed that Flourens had disproven Gall&#x27;s hypotheses through careful ablation – specific and deliberate removal – of brain regions. However, Gall&#x27;s former student, Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud, kept the localization of function hypothesis alive (especially with regards to a &quot;language center&quot;), although he rejected much of the remaining phrenological thinking. In 1848, Bouillaud relied on his work with patients with brain damage to challenge other professionals to disprove him by finding a case of frontal lobe damage unaccompanied by a disorder of speech. His son-in-law, Ernest Aubertin (1825–1893), began seeking out cases to either support or disprove the theory, and he found several in support of it.

Broca&#x27;s Society of Anthropology of Paris was a place where language was regularly discussed in the context of race and nationality, and it also became a platform for addressing its physiological aspects. The localization of function controversy became a topic of regular debate when several experts of head and brain anatomy, including Aubertin, joined the society. Most of these experts still supported Flourens&#x27; argument, but Aubertin was persistent in presenting new patients to counter their views. However, it was Broca, not Aubertin, who finally put the localization issue to rest.

In 1861, Broca visited a patient in the Bicêtre Hospital named Louis Victor Leborgne, who had a 21-year progressive loss of speech and paralysis but not a loss of comprehension nor mental function. He was nicknamed &quot;Tan&quot; due to his inability to clearly speak any words other than &quot;tan&quot; (pronounced , as in the French word , &quot;time&quot;). Leborgne died several days later due to an uncontrolled infection and resultant gangrene, Broca performed an autopsy, hoping to find a physical explanation for Leborgne&#x27;s disability. He determined that, as predicted, Leborgne did in fact have a lesion in the frontal lobe in one of the cerebral hemispheres, which in this case turned out to be the left. From a comparative progression of Leborgne&#x27;s loss of speech and motor movement, the area of the brain important for speech production was determined to lie within the third convolution of the left frontal lobe, next to the lateral sulcus. One day after Tan&#x27;s death Broca presented his findings to the anthropological society.

A second case after Leborgne is what solidified Broca&#x27;s beliefs that human speech function was localized. Lazare Lelong was an 84-year-old grounds worker who was being treated at Bicêtre for dementia. He had also lost the ability to speak other than five simple, meaningful words – these included his own name, &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;always&quot; as well as the number &quot;three&quot;. After his death his brain was also autopsied. Broca found a lesion that encompassed much the same area as had been affected in Leborgne&#x27;s brain. This finding concluded that a specific area controlled one&#x27;s ability to produce meaningful sounds, and when it is affected, one can lose their capability to communicate. For the next two years, Broca went on to find autopsy evidence from twelve more cases in support of the localization of articulated language.

Broca published his findings from the autopsies of the twelve patients in his paper &quot;Localization of Speech in the Third Left Frontal Cultivation&quot; in 1865. His work inspired others to perform careful autopsies with the aim of linking more brain regions to sensory and motor functions. Although history credits this discovery to Broca, another French neurologist, Marc Dax, had made similar observations a generation earlier. Based on his work with approximately forty patients and subjects from other papers, Dax presented his findings at an 1836 conference of southern France physicians in Montpellier. Dax died soon after this presentation and it was not reported or published until after Broca made his initial findings. Accordingly, Dax&#x27;s and Broca&#x27;s conclusions that the left frontal lobe is essential for producing language are considered to be independent.

However, the brains of Leborgne and Lelong had been preserved whole; Broca had never sliced them to reveal the other damaged structures beneath. Over 100 years later Nina Dronkers, an American cognitive neuroscientist, obtained permission to re-examine these brains using modern MRI technology. This imaging resulted in virtual slices of the historic brains and revealed that these patients had sustained much more damage to the brain than Broca could have known from just studying the outer surface. Their lesions extended to deeper layers beyond the left frontal lobe, including portions of insular cortex and critical white matter pathways below the cortex. This work was published in a peer-reviewed article, and has been cited.

The brains of many of Broca&#x27;s aphasic patients are still preserved and available for viewing on a limited basis in the special collections of the Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University (UPMC) in Paris. The collection was formerly displayed in the Musée Dupuytren. His collection of casts is in the Musée d&#x27;Anatomie Delmas-Orfila-Rouvière. Broca presented his study on Leborgne in 1861 in the &quot;Bulletin of the Société Anatomique&quot;.

Patients with damage to Broca&#x27;s area or to neighboring regions of the left inferior frontal lobe are often categorized clinically as having Expressive aphasia (also known as Broca&#x27;s aphasia). This type of aphasia, which often involves impairments in speech output, can be contrasted with receptive aphasia, (also known as Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia), named for Karl Wernicke, which is characterized by damage to more posterior regions of the left temporal lobe, and is often characterized by impairments in language comprehension.

== Criticism ==

=== Darwin ===
In 1868 Charles Darwin criticized Broca for believing in the existence of a tailless mutant of the Ceylon junglefowl, described in 1807 by the Dutch aristocrat, zoologist and museum director Coenraad Jacob Temminck.

=== Stephen Jay Gould ===
Broca was one of the first anthropologists engaged in comparative anatomy of primates and humans. Comparing then-dominant craniometry-based measures of intelligence, as well as other factors such as relative forearm-to-arm length, he proposed that Negroes were an intermediate form between apes and Europeans. The evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould criticized Broca and his contemporaries of being engaged in &quot;scientific racism&quot; when conducting their research. Basing their work on biological determinism, and &quot;&quot;a priori&quot; expectations&quot; that &quot;social and economic differences between human groups—primarily races, classes, and sexes—arise from inherited, inborn distinctions and that society, in this sense, is an accurate reflection of biology.&quot;
==Legacy==

The discovery of Broca&#x27;s area revolutionized the understanding of language processing, speech production, and comprehension, as well as what effects damage to this area may cause. Broca played a major role in the localization of function debate, by resolving the issue scientifically with Leborgne and his 12 cases thereafter. His research led others to discover the location of a wide variety of other functions, specifically Wernicke&#x27;s area.

New research has found that dysfunction in the area may lead to other speech disorders such as stuttering and apraxia of speech. Recent anatomical neuroimaging studies have shown that the pars opercularis of Broca&#x27;s area is anatomically smaller in individuals who stutter whereas the pars triangularis appears to be normal.

He also invented more than 20 measuring instruments for the use in craniology, and helped standardize measuring procedures.

His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.

<doc id="145050" wikidata="Q755901" url="?curid=145050" title="Germantown, Maryland">
<text>Germantown is an urbanized census-designated place in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. With a population of 91,249 as of the 2020 census, it is the third-most populous community in Maryland, after Baltimore and Columbia. Germantown is located approximately outside the U.S. capital of Washington, D.C., and is an important part of the Washington metropolitan area.

Germantown was founded in the early 19th century by European immigrants, though much of the area&#x27;s development did not take place until the mid-20th century. The original plan for Germantown divided the area into a downtown and six town villages: Gunners Lake Village, Kingsview Village, Churchill Village, Middlebrook Village, Clopper&#x27;s Mill Village, and Neelsville Village. The Churchill Town Sector at the corner of Maryland Route 118 and Middlebrook Road most closely resembles the center of Germantown because of the location of the Upcounty Regional Services Center, the Germantown Public Library, the Black Rock Arts Center, and pedestrian shopping that features an array of restaurants. Three exits to Interstate 270 [I-270] are less than one mile away, the Maryland Area Regional Commuter train is within walking distance, and the Germantown Transit Center that provides Ride On shuttle service to the Shady Grove station of the Washington Metro&#x27;s Red Line is also available.

Germantown has the assigned ZIP codes of 20874 and 20876 for delivery and 20875 for post office boxes. It is the only &quot;Germantown, Maryland&quot; recognized by the United States Postal Service, though three other Maryland counties have unincorporated communities with the same name.

==History==

===Early history (1830–1865)===
In the 1830s and 1840s, the central business area was focused around the intersection of Liberty Mill Road and Clopper Road. Several German immigrants set up shop at the intersection and the town became known as &quot;German Town&quot;, even though most residents of the town were of English or Scottish descent.

====American Civil War====

Although it avoided much of the physical destruction that ravaged other cities in the region, the Civil War was still a cause of resentment and division among residents of Germantown. Many Germantown residents were against slavery and had sons fighting for the Union Army. In contrast, other residents of Germantown owned slaves, and even those who were not slave-owners had sons fighting for the Confederate Army. As a result, many people in Germantown, who had been on friendly terms with each other, made an effort not to interact with each other, such as switching churches, or frequenting a store or mill miles away from the ones they would normally do business with.

Late in the summer and fall of 1861, there were more than twenty thousand Union soldiers camped to the west of Germantown, in neighboring Darnestown and Poolesville. Occasionally, these soldiers would come to Germantown and frequent the stores there. In September 1862 and in June 1863, several regiments of Union Army soldiers marched north on Maryland Route 355, on their way to the battles of Antietam and Gettysburg, respectively. In July 1864, General Jubal Early led his army of Confederate soldiers down Maryland Route 355 to attack the Union capital of Washington, D.C. Throughout the course of the war, Confederate raiders would often pass through the Germantown area. Local farmers in the Germantown area lost horses and other livestock to both Union and Confederate armies.

====Assassination of Abraham Lincoln====
In 1865, George Atzerodt, a co-conspirator in the assassination of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, was captured in Germantown. Atzerodt had come to the town with his family from Prussia when he was about nine years old. About five years later, his father moved the family to Virginia, but Atzerodt still had many friends and relatives in Germantown. He was living in Port Tobacco during the Civil War, and supplementing his meager income as a carriage painter by smuggling people across the Potomac River in a rowboat. This clandestine occupation brought him into contact with John Surratt and John Wilkes Booth and he was drawn into a plot to kidnap President Lincoln. On April 14, 1865, Booth gave Atzerodt a gun and told him that he was to kill U.S. Vice President Andrew Johnson, which he refused to do. When he found out that Booth had shot Lincoln, Atzerodt panicked and fled to the Germantown farm of his cousin Hartman Richter, on Schaeffer Road near Clopper Road. He was discovered there by soldiers on April 20, six days after the assassination. Atzerodt was tried, convicted and hanged on July 7, 1865, along with co-conspirators Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, and David Herold at Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Fort McNair.

===Expansion (1865–1950)===
Germantown did not have a public school until after the end of the American Civil War. During that time, education was handled at home. In 1868, a one-room schoolhouse was built on Maryland Route 118, near Black Rock Road, which hosted children from both Germantown and neighboring Darnestown. In 1883, a larger one-room schoolhouse was built closer to Clopper Road. Another, newer school was constructed in 1910, on what is now the site of Germantown Elementary School. This school had four rooms, with two downstairs and two upstairs, with each room housing two grade levels. After the eighth grade, the students would head via train to nearby Rockville, for further education.
The wooden structure of the Bowman Brothers Mill fell victim to a fire in 1914. Four years later, the owners were back in business again, selling the mill to the Liberty Milling Company, a brand new corporation. Augustus Selby was the first owner and manager of the new Liberty Mill, which opened in 1918. Electricity was brought into Liberty Mill and also served the homes and businesses nearby, making Germantown the first area in the northern portion of Montgomery County to receive electricity.

In 1935, professional baseball player Walter Perry Johnson, who played as a pitcher for the Washington Senators (now the Minnesota Twins), purchased a farm on what is now the site of Seneca Valley High School. Used as a dairy farm, Johnson lived there with his five children and his mother (his wife had died), until his death in 1946. A road near the school was named after him.

&quot;Feed the Liberty Way&quot; was used as a slogan for Liberty Mill which, with eight silos, became the second largest mill in all of Maryland, supplying flour to the United States Army during World War II. Cornmeal and animal feed were also manufactured at Liberty Mill, and a store at the mill sold specialty mixes, such as pancake and muffin mix. Following the end of World War II, the Liberty Mill went into disrepair. For over 25 years, the mill continued to deteriorate until it was destroyed by an arsonist on May 30, 1972. The cement silos were removed by the county in 1986 to make way for the MARC Germantown train station commuter parking lot.

===Development and master plan (1950–1980)===

In January 1958, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission was relocated from its location in downtown Washington, D.C., to Germantown, which was considered far enough from the city to withstand a Soviet nuclear attack. The facility now operates as an administration complex for the U.S. Department of Energy and headquarters for its Office of Biological and Environmental Research.

Marshall Davis owned a farm located where I-270 and Germantown Road intersect today. After I-270 divided his farm in two, Davis decided to sell the last of his land to the International Development Corporation for about $1,300 per acre in 1955. Fairchild-Hiller Corporation bought the land for about $4,000 per acre in 1964, and it built an industrial park on the land four years later. Harry Unglesee and his family sold their farm near Hoyles Mill Road for less than $1,000 per acre in 1959. Other farmers soon sold their land to developers and speculators as well.

The Germantown Master Plan was adopted in 1967. The plan for the area included a dense central downtown area and less dense development surrounding it. In 1967, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, in its planning of the Washington metro, considered having Germantown be the western terminus for the Red Line. Ultimately, Shady Grove was selected instead.

In 1974, the Montgomery County Council approved an amended plan written by the Montgomery County Planning Board. The amended plan included a downtown area and six separate villages, each comprising smaller neighborhoods with schools, shopping areas, and public facilities. The amended plan also included the construction of a third campus for Montgomery College near the downtown area. The same year, the completion of a sewer line helped the development and growth of Germantown.

During the 1970s, Wernher von Braun, a German rocket scientist during World War II, worked for the aerospace company Fairchild Industries, which had offices in Germantown, as its vice president for Engineering and Development. Von Braun worked at Fairchild Industries from July 1, 1972, until his death on June 16, 1977. The A-10 Thunderbolt and the landing gear of the Space Shuttle were both designed at these offices.

The Germantown Campus of Montgomery College opened on October 21, 1978. At the time, it consisted of two buildings, 24 employees, and 1,200 students. Enrollment had increased to five thousand students by 2003, with eighty employees across four buildings. A steel water tower modeled after the Earth can be seen from orbiting satellites in outer space. As of 2008, a forty-acre bio-technology laboratory was nearing completion.

===Economic growth and modern development (1980–present)===

Since the early 1980s, Germantown has experienced rapid economic and population growth, both in the form of townhouses and single-family dwellings, and an urbanized &quot;town center&quot; has been built. Germantown was the fastest growing zip code in the Washington metropolitan area and Maryland in 1986, and the 1980s saw a population growth of 323.3% for Germantown.

In 2000, the Upcounty Regional Services Center opened in Germantown, and a 16,000 square feet section of the first floor was home to the Germantown Public Library for several years until it moved to a new, 19 million dollar complex in 2007. On September 29, 2013, it was renamed as the Sidney Kramer Upcounty Regional Services Center after Sidney Kramer, Montgomery County executive from 1986 to 1990.

In October 2000, the Maryland SoccerPlex opened in Germantown. The sports complex includes nineteen natural grass fields, three artificial fields, a 5,200 seat soccer stadium with lighting and press box, eight indoor convertible basketball/volleyball courts. Two miniature golf courses, a splash park, a driving range, an archery course, community garden, model boat pond, two BMX courses, tennis center, and a swim center are also located within the confines of the complex. The soccerplex was the home of the Washington Spirit of the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League from 2013 to 2019.

On October 14, 2002, the D.C. snipers briefly stopped at Milestone Shopping center in Germantown.

In 2003, one of Germantown&#x27;s trailer parks, the Cider Barrel Mobile Home Park, closed after decades of operation, having been in business since at least the 1970s. Despite this closure, the Barrel building itself was preserved, with a cluster of garden apartments erected near it.

On August 14, 2011, a 7-Eleven convenience store in downtown Germantown fell victim to a flash mob robbery of nearly forty people. The incident garnered widespread attention in the United States and internationally.

Holy Cross Health opened a hospital on the campus of Montgomery College in October 2014, becoming the first hospital in the U.S. to be built on a community college campus. The opening of the new 93-bed hospital strengthened the college&#x27;s medical program by giving students the opportunity for hands-on work and access to more advanced medical technology. The hospital was projected to eventually bring 5,000 new jobs to the area.

In August 2017, Brandi Edinger initiated efforts to crowdfund the repurposing of the historic Cider Barrel as a bakery via Kickstarter, but failed to meet the $80,000 goal set. On January 1, 2020, it was reported that plans are underway to reopen the Barrel in the spring of that year after it was closed for nearly two decades. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic it had been delayed indefinitely.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the community has a total area of 10.9 sq mi (28.0 km), of which all but (0.46%) is land.

===Climate===
Germantown lies within the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), with hot, humid summers, cool winters, and generous precipitation year-round. Its location above the Fall Line in the Piedmont region gives it slightly lower temperatures than cities to the south and east such as Washington, D.C., and Silver Spring. Summers are hot and humid with frequent afternoon thunderstorms. July is the warmest month, with an average temperature of . Winters are cool but variable, with sporadic snowfall and lighter rain showers of longer duration. January is the coldest month, with an average temperature of . Average annual rainfall totals .

In 2023, WalletHub honored Germantown as the most ethnically diverse city in the United States.

==Economy==

Since development began in the late 20th century, Germantown has experienced economies of agglomeration, with many high-tech companies opening headquarters and other offices in Germantown and other areas along the I-270 corridor. Qiagen North America, Earth Network Systems Inc., Digital Receiver Technology Inc., Mid-Atlantic Federal Credit Union, and Hughes Network Systems all have their headquarters in Germantown.

In addition to the companies headquartered in Germantown, many have offices in the area, including Wabtec, Viasat, RADA USA, Mars Symbioscience, Xerox, General Electric Aviation, Earth Networks, WeatherBug, and Proxy Aviation Systems.

==Government==
Despite its size, Germantown has never been incorporated formally as a town or a city. It has no mayor or city council and is thus governed by Montgomery County. It is now represented by Democrat Marilyn Balcombe in the Montgomery County Council, after being represented by Craig L. Rice from 2010 through 2022. Germantown is part of two districts for the Maryland General Assembly, 15 (ZIP code 20874), and 39 (ZIP code 20876). For the US Congress, it is part of Maryland&#x27;s 6th district.

The U.S. Department of Energy has its headquarters for the Office of Biological and Environmental Research in Germantown. The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission was moved from its location in downtown Washington, D.C., to the present-day U.S. Department of Energy building in Germantown because of fears of a Soviet nuclear attack on the U.S. capital. At the time, Germantown was believed to be far enough from Washington, D.C., to avoid the worst effects of a nuclear strike on the city. The facility now operates as an administration complex for the U.S. Department of Energy.

==Education==

All the public schools in Germantown are part of the Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) system. The elementary schools in Germantown are Cedar Grove Elementary School, Clopper Mill Elementary School, Fox Chapel Elementary School, Germantown Elementary School, Great Seneca Creek Elementary School, Captain James E. Daly Jr. Elementary School, Lake Seneca Elementary School, Ronald McNair Elementary School, Sally K. Ride Elementary School, Spark Matsunaga Elementary School, S.

Clemente Middle School, which feed into three high schools: Northwest High School, Clarksburg High School and Seneca Valley High School. Students from Kingsview move on to Northwest, students from Neelsville move on to Clarksburg while those from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Roberto W. Clemente Middle Schools move on to Seneca Valley High School. Additionally, the Longview School, which provides special education services, is located in Germantown.

Montgomery College, the largest higher education institution in Montgomery County, has its largest campus in Germantown. It is located on Observation Drive not far from the downtown area.

==Culture==
===Music===
The BlackRock Center for the Arts is located in the downtown Germantown, at the Germantown Town Center. The BlackRock Center for the Arts also sponsors the Germantown Oktoberfest, an annual festival held every year in the fall, which includes various genres of music, including traditional German folk, rock and pop. The Harmony Express Men&#x27;s Chorus is a 4-part a cappella men&#x27;s chorus based in Germantown.

The band Clutch is also from Germantown. Members of the group attended Seneca Valley High School together, with several members graduating with the Class of 1989. Two years later, in 1991, the band was formed.

The Montgomery County Road Runners Club annually hosts the Riley&#x27;s Rumble Half Marathon &amp; 8K that starts and finishes in the SoccerPlex. The SoccerPlex formerly hosted the Washington Spirit of the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League. The Germantown Swim Center is also located within the SoccerPlex. The swim center has hosted many major swimming events including Metros and the 2022 Landmark Conference Swimming &amp; Diving Championship.

===Historical society===
The Germantown Historical Society (GHS) was formed in 1990 as a non-profit organization with a mission to educate the public about local history and preserve local historic sites. The GHS office and future museum is located in the historic Germantown Bank (1922) at 19330 Mateny Hill Road, across from the MARC railroad station. The GHS offers lectures on local history and has traveling exhibits about Germantown. It also sells the books, Liberty Mill T-shirts, and other souvenirs. The main fundraiser for the organization is the Germantown Community Flea Market, held on the first Saturday of the month April through November in the MARC parking lot, Rt. 118 and Bowman Mill Drive, featuring more than 150 vendors.

===Media===
Germantown is served by a news and information website known as the &quot;Germantown Pulse&quot;. The &quot;Germantown Pulse&quot; covers a wide range of topics, including sports, schools, crime, music, and other events of note in the area. However, its main website ceased to update by August 2019.

===Veterans===
Germantown veterans are served by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, American Legion Post 295. American Legion Post 295 sponsors Cub Scout Pack 436, a Venturing Crew and is establishing a Sea Scout Ship. American Legion Boys State and American Legion Baseball have been longtime programs supported by the Post.

==Transportation==

Germantown is bisected by I-270, one of Maryland&#x27;s busiest highways. Northbound traffic heads toward Frederick and I-270 and southbound traffic heads toward Bethesda and the Capital Beltway. I-270 has three exits in Germantown.

Germantown also has a station on the MARC train&#x27;s Brunswick Line, which operates over CSX&#x27;s Metropolitan Subdivision. The station building itself, at the corner of Liberty Mill Road and Mateny Hill Road, is a copy of the original 1891 structure designed by E. Francis Baldwin for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The modern station building was rebuilt after it was destroyed by arson in 1978.

The Montgomery County public transit bus system, Ride On, serving Montgomery County with over 100 bus routes, operates a major transit hub in Germantown known as the Germantown Transit Center. The transit center serves approximately 20 routes, making it one of the largest transit centers in the county.

, a light rail system, the Corridor Cities Transitway, is under evaluation. If constructed, the system would connect the terminal of the Washington Metro Red Line, Shady Grove station in nearby Derwood to Germantown and continue northward to Clarksburg.

==In popular culture==
Germantown is featured in the video game &quot;Fallout 3&quot; (2008). After the town has been destroyed by a nuclear war, &#x27;Germantown Police HQ&#x27; subsequently becomes a mutant-run prison camp. While the in-game location name &#x27;Germantown Police HQ&#x27; is actually a misnomer. The location is most likely based on the single real-life police station in the town, which is a County Police Station. Sam Fisher, the protagonist of the &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell&quot; video game series, lives on a farm in rural Germantown, according to the novelizations of the series.

Germantown is featured in several episodes of the U.S. television series &quot;The X-Files&quot;, notably as a hotbed for biomedical engineering and research, as in reality. There are indeed a handful of biomedical research facilities in the area. The show&#x27;s creator, Chris Carter, stated that he decided to set several episodes in Germantown as his brother used to live in the town. In one or more episodes, Germantown is depicted as being near a wharf or harbor; this is not accurate to the actual area.

<text>Alberto Gerchunoff (January 1, 1883 – March 2, 1950), was an Argentine writer born in the Russian Empire, in the city of Proskuriv, now Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine.

The colony was founded by philanthropist Baron Maurice de Hirsch as a haven for Jews fleeing the pogroms of Europe. Later, he lived in Argentina&#x27;s capital, Buenos Aires. Jorge Luis Borges described him thus:

::He was an indisputable writer, but his reputation transcends that of a man of letters. Unintentionally and perhaps unwittingly, he embodied an older type of writer ... who saw the written word as a mere stand-in for the oral, not as a sacred object.

Although he worked primarily as a journalist for Argentina&#x27;s leading newspaper &quot;La Nación&quot;, he also wrote many important novels and books on Jewish life in Latin America, including &quot;The Jewish Gauchos of the Pampas&quot; (), which was produced into a movie in 1975.

For most of his life Gerchunoff espoused assimilationism for the Jews of Argentina, though altered his stance with the rise of Hitler, eventually advocating for the establishment of the state of Israel before the United Nations in 1947. He is said to have collaborated with Wilhelm Reich on a version of his orgone box designed to preserve the core of Jewish cultural memories, many of which were collected by him as oral histories and published under the title &quot;Héroes de los Intersticios&quot; in 1948.

<text>Germantown is an unincorporated community in Worcester County, Maryland, United States. It is located at at the intersection of Germantown and Bethel roads, southeast of Berlin.

This historically black community is the location of several AME churches, including Tyree AME, begun by relatives of Methodist minister the Rev. Dr. Charles Tindley, the man whose hymn &quot;I Shall Overcome&quot; became the germ for the very memorable civil rights anthem, &quot;We Shall Overcome.&quot;

Germantown Road crosses Route 113 to become South Main St of Berlin, MD (&quot;America&#x27;s Coolest Small Town&quot; 2014). At one time the community was known as Germantown, possibly in reference to the name Berlin, whose derivation is questioned, some saying it&#x27;s a morphology of Burley Inn.

Historically, Berlin and Germantown are nearly totally segregated. While some whites and latinos now live on the east side of 113, hardly any black families own property in Berlin on the west side of 113. 

Parts of Germantown are within Berlin town limits, including Tyree church.

Like other low elevation parts of Worcester County, Germantown contributes to the subtle wetland ecosystem feeding into Newport Bay. At one time, long carefully maintained ditches were essential to prevent flooding and allow for agriculture. The soil there, like much of Worcester county and the Maryland Eastern Shore in general, is often USDA prime agricultural soil, a deep black humus enriched loam topsoil with a clayey loam base. Hardly any stones are encountered. However, the soil can be variable, and wooded areas can be deep with centuries of leaf mold. In general, soft ground, especially during spring, after snow melt and rains, is a perennial problem. Wells and septic systems are used, either new expensive and finicky sand mounds or like most something which was grandfathered in. The forest is dense, and similar to that of surrounding areas, with abundant sweet gum pioneers eventually giving way to large, often massive loblolly pines.

Loss of property by tax lien auctions held annually by Worcester county for properties 2 years in arrears is a persistent threat to black property ownership, though many families can trace family homes going back to the Reconstruction. Tax liens are often purchased by local or in state investors, out of state LLCs domiciled in Delaware, and on occasion large foreign conglomerates looking for anything approximate to Atlantic coastal areas. Much of the properties are rentals, with absentee landlords using local real estate agents as property managers. These are notably poorly maintained, but generally the owner occupied single family houses are cared for with pride, even the most humble ones.

<text>Stanislaus Pascal Franchot Tone (February 27, 1905 – September 18, 1968) was an American actor, producer, and director of stage, film and television. He was a leading man in the 1930s and early 1940s, and at the height of his career was known for his gentlemanly sophisticate roles, with supporting roles by the 1950s. His acting crossed many genres including pre-Code romantic leads to &quot;noir&quot; layered roles and World War I films. He appeared as a guest star in episodes of several golden age television series, including &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; while continuing to act and produce in the theater and movies throughout the 1960s.

Tone was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Midshipman Roger Byam in &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1935), along with his co-stars Clark Gable and Charles Laughton, making it the only film to have three simultaneous Best Actor nominations, and leading to the creation of the Best Supporting Actor category.

== Early life and education ==
Stanislaus Pascal Franchot Tone was born in Niagara Falls, New York, the youngest son of Dr. Frank Jerome Tone, the wealthy president of the Carborundum Company, and his socially prominent wife, Gertrude Van Vrancken Franchot. Tone was also a distant relative of Wolfe Tone (the &quot;father of Irish Republicanism&quot;). Tone was of French Canadian, Irish, Dutch and English ancestry. Through his ancestor, the nobleman Gilbert L&#x27;Homme de Basque, translated to Basque Homme and finally Bascom, he was of French Basque descent.

Tone was educated at The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, from which he was dismissed and Niagara Falls High School
. He entered Cornell University, where he was president of the drama club, acting in productions of Shakespeare. He was also elected to the Sphinx Head Society and joined the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity. After graduating in 1927, he gave up the family business to pursue an acting career, moving to Greenwich Village, New York.

== Career ==

=== 1927–1932: Broadway ===
Tone was in &quot;The Belt&quot; (1927), &quot;Centuries&quot; (1927–28), &quot;The International&quot; (1928), and a popular adaptation of &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; (1928–29) with Katherine Cornell. He followed it with appearances in &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; (1929), &quot;Cross Roads&quot; (1929), &quot;Red Rust&quot; (1929–30), &quot;Hotel Universe&quot; (1930), and &quot;Pagan Lady&quot; (1930–31).

He joined the Theatre Guild and played Curly in their production of &quot;Green Grow the Lilacs&quot; (1931)&quot;,&quot; where Tone sang, which later became the basis for the musical &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; Robert Benchley of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; said that &quot;Tone made lyrical love to [co-star] Walker&quot; between the Sammy Lee chorus routines of the play. The Lynn Riggs play received mixed reviews, mostly favorable, and was a popular success lasting 64 performances on Broadway in addition to its roa was also a founding member of the Group Theatre, when the Theater Guild disbanded, along with other former guild members Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford, Lee Strasberg, Stella Adler, and Clifford Odets. Clifford Odets recalled of Tone&#x27;s acting, &quot;The two most talented young actors I have known in the American theater in my time have been Franchot Tone and Marlon Brando, and I think Franchot was the more talented.&quot; Strasberg, who was a director in the Group during 1931–1941 and then teacher of &quot;The Method&quot; in the 1950s, had been a castmate of Tone&#x27;s in &quot;Green Grow the Lilacs&quot;.

These were intense and productive years for him; among the productions of the Group he acted in were &quot;1931&quot; (1931) lasting 12 performances, Maxwell Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Night Over Taos&quot; (1932) a play in verse that lasted 10, &quot;The House of Connelly&quot; (1931) lasting 91 performances and John Howard Lawson&#x27;s &quot;Success Story&quot; (1932) directed by Lee Strasberg. Outside of Group productions, he was in &quot;A Thousand Summers&quot; (1932).

Tone made his film debut with &quot;The Wiser Sex&quot; (1932) starring Claudette Colbert, filmed by Paramount at their Astoria Studios.

=== 1933–1939: The MGM years ===
Tone was the first of the Group to go to Hollywood when MGM offered him a film contract. In his memoir on the Group Theater, &quot;The Fervent Years&quot;, Harold Clurman recalls Tone being the most confrontational and egocentric of the group, a &quot;strikingly individualistic personality.&quot; Burgess Meredith credits Tone with informing him of the existence of &quot;the Method&quot; and what was soon to be the Actors Studio under Strasberg&#x27;s teachings. Tone himself considered cinema far more invasive to private life and paced differently from theater productions. He recalled his stage years with fondness, financially supporting the Group Theater in its declining years.

MGM immediately gave Tone a series of impressive roles, casting him in six pre-Code film standards. Starting in 1933 with a support role in the romantic WWI drama &quot;Today We Live&quot;, written by William Faulkner in collaboration with director Howard Hawks. The script was first conceived as a WWI buddy film, but the studio executives wanted a vehicle for their popular leading lady Joan Crawford, forcing Faulkner and Hawks to work in the romance between co-stars Gary Cooper and Crawford. Tone was then the romantic male lead in &quot;Gabriel Over the White House&quot; starring Walter Huston, followed by a lead role with Loretta Young in &quot;Midnight Mary&quot;.

Tone romanced Miriam Hopkins in King Vidor&#x27;s &quot;The Stranger&#x27;s Return&quot; and was the male lead in &quot;Stage Mother&quot;. He also had a role in &quot;Bombshell&quot;, with Jean Harlow and Lee Tracy. The last of the sequence of films was &quot;Dancing Lady&quot;, with an on-screen love triangle with his future wife Joan Crawford and Clark Gable, which was a &quot;lavishly staged spectacle&quot; with a solid performance by Tone.

Twentieth Century Pictures borrowed Tone to romance Constance Bennett in &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; (1934) as she played dual roles in which &quot;she shines as a comedienne&quot; and his performance was called &quot;equally clever in a role that calls for a serious mein&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Back at MGM, he was again co-starring with Crawford in &quot;Sadie McKee&quot; (1934), then was borrowed by Fox to co-star &quot;commendably&quot; with Madeleine Carroll in John Ford&#x27;s French Foreign Legion picture, &quot;The World Moves On&quot; (1934).

After &quot;The Girl from Missouri&quot; (1934) with Harlow, MGM finally gave Tone top billing in &quot;Straight Is the Way&quot; (1934), although it was considered a &quot;B&quot; film, one which didn&#x27;t have a high publicity or production cost. Warner Bros. then borrowed him for &quot;Gentlemen Are Born&quot; (1934).

At Paramount, Tone co-starred in the Academy Award nominated hit movie, &quot;The Lives of a Bengal Lancer&quot; (1935) with Gary Cooper. He was top billed in &quot;One New York Night&quot; (1935) but billed underneath Harlow and William Powell in &quot;Reckless&quot; (1935). He supported Crawford and Robert Montgomery in &quot;No More Ladies&quot; (1935) and had another box-office success with &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;, for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, along with co-stars Clark Gable and Charles Laughton.

Warner Bros. borrowed him again, this time to play Bette Davis&#x27; leading man in &quot;Dangerous&quot; (1935). After a lead role in &quot;Exclusive Story&quot; (1935), he was again paired with friend Loretta Young in &quot;The Unguarded Hour&quot; (1936), and also starred with Grace Moore in Columbia&#x27;s &quot;The King Steps Out&quot; (1936), notable for the debut of an eleven-year-old Gwen Verdon.

Tone and Harlow co-starred again in &quot;Suzy&quot; (1936) with then up and comer Cary Grant, who was billed third. The film was popular with audiences, but reviews were less than kind with &quot;The New York Times&quot; negatively comparing it to other recent WWI movies calling it &quot;balderdash&quot;, but thanked &quot;Mr. Tone for the few honest moments of drama that the film possesses. His young Irishman is about the only convincing and natural character in the piece.&quot; He then filmed &quot;The Gorgeous Hussy&quot; (1936) with Crawford, Robert Taylor and Lionel Barrymore with co-star Beulah Bondi earning an Academy Award nomination for the Andrew Jackson period piece. A Crawford and Gable film capitalizing on &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; by casting the pair in roles as fast talking journalists in &quot;Love on the Run&quot; (1936), found Tone in a supporting role.

RKO borrowed him to appear opposite Katharine Hepburn in &quot;Quality Street&quot; (1937), a costume drama that lost $248,000 at the box office. Back at MGM he supported Spencer Tracy and Gladys George in &quot;They Gave Him a Gun&quot; (1937).
He had the lead in &quot;Between Two Women&quot; (1937) and co-starred for the final time with Crawford in &quot;The Bride Wore Red&quot; (1937), then joined Myrna Loy in &quot;Man-Proof&quot; (1938) and Gladys George in &quot;Love Is a Headache&quot; (1938).

In &quot;Three Comrades&quot; (1938) Tone was teamed with Robert Taylor and Margaret Sullavan in a film about disillusioned soldiers returning to Germany after World War I. He made &quot;Three Loves Has Nancy&quot; (1938) with Janet Gaynor and Robert Montgomery and co-starred with Franciska Gaal in &quot;The Girl Downstairs&quot; (1938), a Cinderella type story. He then starred in a &quot;B&quot; picture with Ann Sothern in &quot;Fast and Furious&quot; (1939) as married crime sleuths, the third movie in a series with different sets of actors in each, that were marketed towards the &quot;Thin Man&quot; films audiences.

After his contract ended, Tone left MGM in 1939 to act on Broadway in a return to his stage roots, often working with &quot;the Group&#x27;s&quot; members of its formative years, and playwrights such as Eugene O&#x27;Neill. He returned to Broadway for Irwin Shaw&#x27;s &quot;The Gentle People&quot; (1939) and an adaptation of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;The Fifth Column&quot; (1940), which only had a short run.

=== 1940–1949: The Universal, Columbia &amp; Paramount combination ===

Tone signed a contract with Universal, starring in his first Western there, &quot;Trail of the Vigilantes&quot; (1940), where he more than earns his spurs alongside the likes of Broderick Crawford and Andy Devine. He was soon back supporting female stars though, making &quot;Nice Girl?&quot; (1941) with Deanna Durbin.

Tone also signed a multi-picture deal with Columbia, where he made two films with Joan Bennett, &quot;She Knew All the Answers&quot; (1941) and &quot;The Wife Takes a Flyer&quot; (1942).

Back at Universal he was top billed in &quot;This Woman Is Mine&quot; (1941). Tone went to Paramount to star in &quot;Five Graves to Cairo&quot; (1942), a World War II espionage story directed by Billy Wilder.

He also returned to MGM to star in &quot;Pilot No. 5&quot; (1943) then it was back to Universal for &quot;His Butler&#x27;s Sister&quot; (1943) with Durbin.

Tone made two more films at Paramount, &quot;True to Life&quot; (1943) with Mary Martin and &quot;The Hour Before the Dawn&quot; (1944) with Veronica Lake. He had one of his best roles in Universal&#x27;s &quot;Phantom Lady&quot; (1944) directed by Robert Siodmak, an early film noir picture and a villainous part for Tone. Also impressive was his performance in &quot;Dark Waters&quot; (1944) with Merle Oberon for Benedict Bogeaus.

He continued his stage career by performing on Broadway in &quot;Hope for the Best&quot; (1945) with Jane Wyatt; the production ran for a little more than three months.

At Universal Tone did &quot;That Night with You&quot; (1945) with Susanna Foster and &quot;Because of Him&quot; (1946) with Durbin.

Tone made &quot;Lost Honeymoon&quot; (1947) at Eagle-Lion Studios and &quot;Honeymoon&quot; (1947) with Shirley Temple. While at Columbia he had roles in &quot;Her Husband&#x27;s Affairs&quot; (1947) with Lucille Ball, and &quot;I Love Trouble&quot; (1947), then &quot;Every Girl Should Be Married&quot; (1948) reteamed with Grant at RKO. He had the lead as an assistant D.A. looking for the murderer of a journalist while being distracted by a beauty played by then wife Jean Wallace in the film noir thriller, &quot;Jigsaw&quot; (1949). He then had a supporting part as a murder victim in &quot;Without Honor&quot; (1949), a noir film co-starring Laraine Day.

=== 1949: Producer ===

Tone produced and starred in &quot;The Man on the Eiffel Tower&quot; (1949), a troubled production suffering from filming delays on location, creative wrangling and the picture’s hard-to-transfer single-strip technicolor film stock. It has benefited from restorations in the 2000s that have coincided with theatrical showings and vastly improved DVD releases. Tone&#x27;s tour de force role as a manic depressive sociopath included performing many of his own stunts on the Paris landmark.

Burgess Meredith and Charles Laughton star with Tone. Meredith is credited as director, although Tone took over duties when Meredith was in front of the camera with Laughton sometimes directing himself. The film has, according to French director Jean Renior, some of the best cinematic pictures of the Eiffel Tower.

=== 1950–1959: Live theater television ===
Tone relocated to New York and began appearing in New York City-based live theater television, including &quot;The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;, &quot;Danger&quot;, &quot;Suspense&quot; and &quot;Starlight Theatre&quot;. He returned to Hollywood to appear in &quot;Here Comes the Groom&quot; (1951).

Back on the small screen, Tone was in &quot;Lights Out&quot;, &quot;Tales of Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Opening Night&quot;, &quot;The Revlon Mirror Theater,&quot; and &quot;The Philip Morris Playhouse&quot;. But he soon returned to Broadway, appearing in a big hit with &quot;Oh, Men! Oh, Women!&quot; (1953–54), which ran for 400 performances, a revival of &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot; (1955) and Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;A Moon for the Misbegotten&quot; with Wendy Hiller and Cyril Cusack in 1957.

During this time he continued to appear on TV adaptations of Broadway plays, in such original productions as &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot;, as well as &quot;The Elgin Hour&quot;, &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot;, and in &quot;The Best of Broadway&quot; series in a production of &quot;The Guardsman&quot; with Claudette Colbert. Tone then continued in &quot;Four Star Theatre&quot;, &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot;, a &quot;Playwrights &#x27;56&quot; production of &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;, &quot;Omnibus&quot;, &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, &quot;The Kaiser Aluminum Hour&quot;, &quot;The Alcoa Hour&quot;, &quot;Climax!&quot;, &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot;, &quot;Pursuit&quot;, &quot;Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;Goodyear Theatre&quot;, &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, and &quot;DuPont Show of the Month&quot;.

He did a TV adaptation of &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; (1956) with Greer Garson and played Frank James in &quot;Bitter Heritage&quot; (1958). In 1957 Tone co-produced, co-directed, and starred in an adaptation of Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, which was filmed concurrently with an off-Broadway revival. His performance as the Russian country doctor with &quot;ennui&quot; was praised and the preserving of the stage production to film only varied by the addition of then-wife Dolores Dorn.

=== 1960–1968: Final films and television ===
In the early 1960s Tone was in episodes of &quot;Bonanza&quot; and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (&quot;The Silence&quot;) and appeared on Broadway in an adaptation of &quot;Mandingo&quot; (1961). He then played the spent, dying president in the screen adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel &quot;Advise &amp; Consent&quot; (1962), an Otto Preminger film that the director had unsuccessfully lobbied Martin Luther King to portray a senator in, while two U.S. senators played extras on Capitol Hill locations previously used for &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.&quot;&quot;&quot;

On stage in 1963 he acted in a revival of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Strange Interlude&quot;, with Ben Gazzarra and Jane Fonda, and &quot;Bicycle Ride to Nevada&quot;. The next year he appeared in Lewis John Carlino&#x27;s &quot;Double Talk&quot;.

He was cast in TV shows such as &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, &quot;Dupont Show of the Week&quot;, &quot;The Reporter&quot;, &quot;Festival&quot;, &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;, and &quot;The Virginian&quot;. He appeared in what is possibly the first TV movie, &quot;See How They Run&quot; (1964).

In Europe, Tone made &quot;La bonne soupe&quot; (1965). He co-starred in the &quot;Ben Casey&quot; medical series from 1965 to 1966 as Casey&#x27;s supervisor, Dr. Daniel Niles Freeland.

He had roles in Otto Preminger&#x27;s film &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot; (1965) in which he portrayed Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and Arthur Penn&#x27;s &quot;Mickey One &quot;(1965), and an episode of &quot;Run for Your Life&quot;. He appeared off-Broadway in &quot;Beyond Desire&quot; (1967) and his last roles were in &quot;Shadow Over Elveron&quot; (1968) and &quot;Nobody Runs Forever&quot; (1968), a British film originally titled &quot;The High Commissioner&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 1935, Tone married actress Joan Crawford; the couple were divorced in 1939. They made seven films together – &quot;Today We Live&quot; (1933), &quot;Dancing Lady&quot; (1933), &quot;Sadie McKee&quot; (1934), &quot;No More Ladies&quot; (1935), &quot;The Gorgeous Hussy&quot; (1936), &quot;Love on the Run&quot; (1936), and &quot;The Bride Wore Red&quot; (1937). Their union produced no children; despite considerable effort, Crawford&#x27;s pregnancies all ended in miscarriage.

Tone took their divorce hard, and his recollections of her were cynical — &quot;She&#x27;s like that old joke about Philadelphia: first prize, four years with Joan; second prize, eight&quot;. Many years later, however, when Tone was dying of lung cancer, Joan often cared for him, paying for medical treatments. Tone suggested they remarry, but she declined.

In 1941, Tone married fashion model-turned-actress Jean Wallace, who appeared with Tone in both &quot;Jigsaw&quot; and &quot;The Man on the Eiffel Tower&quot;. The couple had two sons and were divorced in 1948. She later married actor Cornel Wilde.

In 1951, Tone&#x27;s relationship with actress Barbara Payton made headlines when he was rendered unconscious for 18 hours and sustained numerous facial injuries following a fistfight with actor Tom Neal, a rival for Payton&#x27;s attention. Plastic surgery nearly fully restored his broken nose and cheek. Tone subsequently married Payton, but divorced her in 1952, after obtaining photographic evidence she had continued her relationship with Neal. Payton and Neal capitalized on the scandal touring with a production of &quot;The&quot; &quot;Postman Always Rings Twice&quot;.

In 1956, Tone married Dolores Dorn, with whom he appeared in a film version of &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; (1957) which Tone directed and produced. The couple divorced in 1959.

== Death ==
Tone, a chain smoker, died of lung cancer in New York City on September 18, 1968. He was cremated and his ashes kept on a shelf in his son&#x27;s library, surrounded by the works of Shakespeare, until July 24, 2022, when they were interred in the Point Comfort Cemetery of Quebec, Canada.

On February 8, 1960, Franchot Tone received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contribution to the motion picture industry, located at 6558 Hollywood Blvd, on the south side of the 6500 block.

<doc id="145064" wikidata="Q162621" url="?curid=145064" title="Walter Huston">
<text>Walter Thomas Huston ( ; April 6, 1884 – April 7, 1950) was a Canadian actor and singer. Huston won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;, directed by his son John Huston. He is the patriarch of the four generations of the Huston acting family, including his son John, grandchildren Anjelica Huston and Danny Huston, as well as great-grandchild Jack Huston. The family has produced three generations of Academy Award winners: Walter, his son John, and granddaughter Anjelica.

==Early life==
Huston was born on April 6, 1884, in Toronto, Ontario, where he attended Winchester Street Public School. He was the son of Elizabeth (née McGibbon) and Robert Moore Huston, a farmer who founded a construction company. He was of Scottish and Irish descent. He had a brother and two sisters, one of whom was the theatrical voice coach Margaret Carrington (1877–1941). 

His family moved, before his birth, from Melville, just south of Orangeville, Ontario, where they were farmers. As a young man, he worked in construction and in his spare time attended the Shaw School of Acting. He made his stage debut in 1902. He went on to tour in &quot;In Convict Stripes&quot;, a play by Hal Reid, father of Wallace Reid and also appeared with Richard Mansfield in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;. He again toured in another play, &quot;The Sign of the Cross&quot;. In 1904, he married Rhea Gore (1882–1938), a sports editor for various publications, and gave up acting to work as a manager of electric power stations in Nevada, Missouri. He maintained these jobs until 1909. 

The couple&#x27;s only child John Huston was born on August 5, 1906, in Nevada, Missouri, at which point Rhea gave up her work to concentrate on motherhood.

==Career==


In 1909, with his marriage foundering, he appeared with an older actress named Bayonne Whipple (born Mina Rose, 1865–1937). They were billed as Whipple and Huston.

Walter and Rhea Gore Huston divorced in 1913, and in December 1914, Huston married Mina Rose. Vaudeville was their livelihood into the 1920s, and Walter&#x27;s son John was sent to live and study in boarding schools. During summer vacations, John traveled separately with each of his parents  – with father Walter on vaudeville tours, and with his mother Rhea to horse races and other sports events. 

Walter Huston began his Broadway career on January 22, 1924, when he performed there in the play &quot;Mr. Pitt&quot;. He then solidified his Broadway career with roles in productions such as &quot;Desire Under the Elms&quot;, &quot;Kongo&quot;, &quot;The Barker&quot;, and &quot;Elmer the Great&quot;.

Once talkies began in Hollywood, he was cast in both character roles and as a leading man. His first major role was portraying the villainous Trampas in &quot;The Virginian&quot; (1929), a Western that costars Gary Cooper and Richard Arlen. Some of Huston&#x27;s other early sound roles include &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; (1930), &quot;Rain&quot; (1932), and &quot;Gabriel Over the White House&quot; (1933).

The career of Mina Rose (a.k.a. Bayonne Whipple) did not follow the same trajectory as Huston&#x27;s, and their act -- and marriage -- collapsed after Huston began to accept solo work. After several years of separation, the two divorced in 1931. Huston remarried that same year, to Ninetta (Nan) Sunderland, and the two remained married until Huston&#x27;s death.

Huston remained busy on stage and screen throughout the 1930s and 1940s, becoming during that period one of America&#x27;s most prominent actors. He starred as the title character in the 1934 Broadway adaptation of Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s novel &quot;Dodsworth&quot; as well as in the play&#x27;s film version released two years later. For his role as Sam Dodsworth, Huston won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor and was Oscar nominated. He performed &quot;September Song&quot; in the original Broadway production of &quot;Knickerbocker Holiday&quot; (1938). Huston&#x27;s recording of &quot;September Song&quot; is heard repeatedly in &quot;September Affair&quot; (1950).

Huston makes an uncredited appearance in the 1941 film noir classic &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, portraying the ship&#x27;s captain who is shot just before delivering the black bird to Sam Spade, played by Humphrey Bogart. Walter&#x27;s son, John Huston, directed the picture. As a practical joke during filming, John had his father enter the scene and die in more than 10 different takes.

Among several of his contributions to World War II Allied propaganda films, Huston in an uncredited role portrays a military instructor in the short &quot;Safeguarding Military Information&quot; (1942). That film was produced by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and distributed by the War Activities Committee of the Motion Pictures Industry. He, along with Anthony Veiller, is also a narrator in the &quot;Why We Fight&quot; series of World War II documentaries directed by Frank Capra. Other films of this period in which he appears are &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; (1941) as Mr. Scratch, &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; (1942), and &quot;Mission to Moscow&quot; (1943). In the latter feature, a pro-Soviet World War II propaganda film, he plays United States Ambassador Joseph E. Davies.

Huston portrays the character Howard in the 1948 adventure drama &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;, which was also directed by his son John. Based on the mysterious B. Traven&#x27;s novel, the film depicts the story of three gold prospectors in 1920s post-revolution Mexico. Walter Huston won the Golden Globe Award and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the film, while John Huston won the Best Director Academy Award, thus making them the first father and son to win at the same ceremony. His last film is &quot;The Furies&quot; (1950) in which he costars with Barbara Stanwyck and Wendell Corey. In that Western, Huston&#x27;s final line is &quot;There will never be another one like me.&quot;

==Death==
On April 7, 1950, Huston died of an aortic aneurysm in his hotel suite in Beverly Hills, one day after his 66th birthday. He was cremated.

==Legacy==
In 1960, a decade after his death, Huston received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6624 Hollywood Boulevard, memorializing his contributions to the entertainment industry through his extensive, critically acclaimed work in motion pictures. He was also a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame.

Huston&#x27;s son John initially became a screenwriter before becoming an Academy Award-winning director and acclaimed actor. All of Huston&#x27;s grandchildren have become actors, as well as his great-grandson. Granddaughter Anjelica sang &quot;September Song&quot; on the May 7, 2012, episode of the NBC TV series &quot;Smash&quot;.

In 1998, Scarecrow Press published John Weld&#x27;s &quot;September Song—An Intimate Biography of Walter Huston&quot;.

<doc id="145066" wikidata="Q2084299" url="?curid=145066" title="Extractive metallurgy">
<text>Extractive metallurgy is a branch of metallurgical engineering wherein process and methods of extraction of metals from their natural mineral deposits are studied. The field is a materials science, covering all aspects of the types of ore, washing, concentration, separation, chemical processes and extraction of pure metal and their alloying to suit various applications, sometimes for direct use as a finished product, but more often in a form that requires further working to achieve the given properties to suit the applications.

The field of ferrous and non-ferrous extractive metallurgy have specialties that are generically grouped into the categories of mineral processing, hydrometallurgy, pyrometallurgy, and electrometallurgy based on the process adopted to extract the metal. Several processes are used for extraction of the same metal depending on occurrence and chemical requirements.

==Mineral processing==
Mineral processing begins with beneficiation, consisting of initially breaking down the ore to required sizes depending on the concentration process to be followed, by crushing, grinding, sieving etc. Thereafter, the ore is physically separated from any unwanted impurity, depending on the form of occurrence and or further process involved. Separation processes take advantage of physical properties of the materials. These physical properties can include density, particle size and shape, electrical and magnetic properties, and surface properties. Major physical and chemical methods include gravitational or magnetic separation, froth flotation etc., whereby the impurities and unwanted materials are removed from the ore and the base ore of the metal is concentrated, meaning the percentage of metal in the ore is increased. This concentrate is then either processed to remove moisture or else used as is for extraction of the metal or made into shapes and forms that can undergo further processing, with ease of handling.

Ore bodies often contain more than one valuable metal. Tailings of a previous process may be used as a feed in another process to extract a secondary product from the original ore. Additionally, a concentrate may contain more than one valuable metal. That concentrate would then be processed to separate the valuable metals into individual constituents.

==Hydrometallurgy==

Hydrometallurgy is concerned with processes involving aqueous solutions to extract metals from ores. The first step in the hydrometallurgical process is leaching, which involves dissolution of the valuable metals into the aqueous solution and or a suitable solvent. After the solution is separated from the ore solids, the extract is often subjected to various processes of purification and concentration before the valuable metal is recovered either in its metallic state or as a chemical compound. This may include precipitation, distillation, adsorption, and solvent extraction. The final recovery step may involve precipitation, cementation, or an electrometallurgical process. Sometimes, hydrometallurgical processes may be carried out directly on the ore material without any pretreatment steps. More often, the ore must be pretreated by various mineral processing steps, and sometimes by pyrometallurgical processes.

==Pyrometallurgy==

Pyrometallurgy involves high temperature processes where chemical reactions take place among gases, solids, and molten materials. Solids containing valuable metals are treated to form intermediate compounds for further processing or converted into their elemental or metallic state. Pyrometallurgical processes that involve gases and solids are typified by calcining and roasting operations. Processes that produce molten products are collectively referred to as smelting operations. The energy required to sustain the high temperature pyrometallurgical processes may derive from the exothermic nature of the chemical reactions taking place. Typically, these reactions are oxidation, e.g. of sulfide to sulfur dioxide . Often, however, energy must be added to the process by combustion of fuel or, in the case of some smelting processes, by the direct application of electrical energy.

Ellingham diagrams are a useful way of analysing the possible reactions, and so predicting their outcome.

==Electrometallurgy==
Electrometallurgy involves metallurgical processes that take place in some form of electrolytic cell. The most common types of electrometallurgical processes are electrowinning and electro-refining. Electrowinning is an electrolysis process used to recover metals in aqueous solution, usually as the result of an ore having undergone one or more hydrometallurgical processes. The metal of interest is plated onto the cathode, while the anode is an inert electrical conductor. Electro-refining is used to dissolve an impure metallic anode (typically from a smelting process) and produce a high purity cathode. Fused salt electrolysis is another electrometallurgical process whereby the valuable metal has been dissolved into a molten salt which acts as the electrolyte, and the valuable metal collects on the cathode of the cell. The fused salt electrolysis process is conducted at temperatures sufficient to keep both the electrolyte and the metal being produced in the molten state. The scope of electrometallurgy has significant overlap with the areas of hydrometallurgy and (in the case of fused salt electrolysis) pyrometallurgy. Additionally, electrochemical phenomena play a considerable role in many mineral processing and hydrometallurgical processes.

== Ionometallurgy ==

Mineral processing and extraction of metals are very energy-intensive processes, which are not exempted of producing large volumes of solid residues and wastewater, which also require energy to be further treated and disposed. Moreover, as the demand for metals increases, the metallurgical industry must rely on sources of materials with lower metal contents both from a primary (e.g., mineral ores) and/or secondary (e.g., slags, tailings, municipal waste) raw materials. Consequently, mining activities and waste recycling must evolve towards the development of more selective, efficient and environmentally friendly mineral and metal processing routes.

Mineral processing operations are needed firstly to concentrate the mineral phases of interest and reject the unwanted material physical or chemically associated to a defined raw material. The process, however, demand about 30 GJ/tonne of metal, which accounts about 29% of the total energy spent on mining in the USA. Meanwhile, pyrometallurgy is a significant producer of greenhouse gas emissions and harmful flue dust. Hydrometallurgy entails the consumption of large volumes of lixiviants such as H2SO4, HCl, KCN, NaCN which have poor selectivity. Moreover, despite the environmental concern and the use restriction imposed by some countries, cyanidation is still considered the prime process technology to recover gold from ores. Mercury is also used by artisanal miners in less economically developed countries to concentrate gold and silver from minerals, despite its obvious toxicity. Bio-hydro-metallurgy make use of living organisms, such as bacteria and fungi, and although this method demands only the input of and from the atmosphere, it requires low solid-to-liquid ratios and long contact times, which significantly reduces space-time yields.

Ionometallurgy makes use of non-aqueous ionic solvents such ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs), which allows the development of closed-loop flow sheet to effectively recover metals by, for instance, integrating the metallurgical unit operations of leaching and electrowinning. It allows to process metals at moderate temperatures in a non-aqueous environment which allows controlling metal speciation, tolerates impurities and at the same time exhibits suitable solubilities and current efficiencies. This simplify conventional processing routes and allows a substantial reduction in the size of a metal processing plant.

=== Metal extraction with ionic fluids ===
DESs are fluids generally composed of two or three cheap and safe components that are capable of self-association, often through hydrogen bond interactions, to form eutectic mixtures with a melting point lower than that of each individual component. DESs are generally liquid at temperatures lower than 100 °C, and they exhibit similar physico-chemical properties to traditional ILs, while being much cheaper and environmentally friendlier. Most of them are mixtures of choline chloride (ChCl) and a hydrogen-bond donor (e.g., urea, ethylene glycol, malonic acid) or mixtures of choline chloride with a hydrated metal salt. Other choline salts (e.g. acetate, citrate, nitrate) have a much higher costs or need to be synthesised, and the DES formulated from these anions are typically much more viscous and can have higher conductivities than for choline chloride. This results in lower plating rates and poorer throwing power and for this reason chloride-based DES systems are still favoured. For instance, Reline (a 1:2 mixture of choline chloride and urea) has been used to selectively recover Zn and Pb from a mixed metal oxide matrix. Similarly, Ethaline (a 1: 2 mixture of choline chloride and ethylene glycol) facilitates metal dissolution in electropolishing of steels. DESs have also demonstrated promising results to recover metals from complex mixtures such Cu/Zn and Ga/As, and precious metals from minerals. It has also been demonstrated that metals can be recovered from complex mixtures by electrocatalysis using a combination of DESs as lixiviants and an oxidising agent, while metal ions can be simultaneously separated from the solution by electrowinning.

==== Recovery of precious metals by ionometallurgy ====
Precious metals are rare, naturally occurring metallic chemical elements of high economic value. Chemically, the precious metals tend to be less reactive than most elements. They include gold and silver, but also the so-called platinum group metals: ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum (see precious metals). Extraction of these metals from their corresponding hosting minerals would typically require pyrometallurgy (e.g., roasting), hydrometallurgy (cyanidation), or both as processing routes.
Early studies have demonstrated that gold dissolution rate in Ethaline compares very favourably to the cyanidation method, which is further enhanced by the addition of iodine as an oxidising agent. In an industrial process the iodine has the potential to be employed as an electrocatalyst, whereby it is continuously recovered in situ from the reduced iodide by electrochemical oxidation at the anode of an electrochemical cell. Dissolved metals can be selectively deposited at the cathode by adjusting the electrode potential. The method also allows better selectivity as part of the gangue (e.g., pyrite) tend to be dissolved more slowly.

Sperrylite (PtAs2) and moncheite (PtTe2), which are typically the more abundant platinum minerals in many orthomagmatic deposits, do not react under the same conditions in Ethaline because they are disulphide (pyrite), diarsenide (sperrylite) or ditellurides (calaverite and moncheite) minerals, which are particularly resistant to iodine oxidation. The reaction mechanism by which dissolution of platinum minerals is taking place is still under investigation.

==== Metal recovery from sulfide minerals with ionometallurgy ====
Metal sulfides (e.g., pyrite FeS2, arsenopyrite FeAsS, chalcopyrite CuFeS2) are normally processed by chemical oxidation either in aqueous media or at high temperatures. In fact, most base metals, e.g., aluminium, chromium, must be (electro)chemically reduced at high temperatures by which the process entails a high energy demand, and sometimes large volumes of aqueous waste is generated. In aqueous media chalcopyrite, for instance, is more difficult to dissolve chemically than covellite and chalcocite due to surface effects (formation of polysulfide species,). The presence of Cl− ions has been suggested to alter the morphology of any sulfide surface formed, allowing the sulfide mineral to leach more easily by preventing passivation. DESs provide a high Cl− ion concentration and low water content, whilst reducing the need for either high additional salt or acid concentrations, circumventing most oxide chemistry. Thus, the electrodissolution of sulfide minerals has demonstrated promising results in DES media in absence of passivation layers, with the release into the solution of metal ions which could be recovered from solution.

During extraction of copper from copper sulfide minerals with Ethaline, chalcocite (Cu2S) and covellite (CuS) produce a yellow solution, indicating that [CuCl4]2− complex are formed. Meanwhile, in the solution formed from chalcopyrite, Cu2+ and Cu+ species co-exist in solution due to the generation of reducing Fe2+ species at the cathode. The best selective recovery of copper (&gt;97%) from chalcopyrite can be obtained with a mixed DES of 20 wt.% ChCl-oxalic acid and 80 wt.% Ethaline.

==== Metal recovery from oxide compounds with Ionometallurgy ====
Recovery of metals from oxide matrixes is generally carried out using mineral acids. However, electrochemical dissolution of metal oxides in DES can allow to enhance the dissolution up to more than 10 000 times in pH neutral solutions.

Studies have shown that ionic oxides such as ZnO tend to have high solubility in ChCl:malonic acid, ChCl:urea and Ethaline, which can resemble the solubilities in aqueous acidic solutions, e.g., HCl. Covalent oxides such as TiO2, however, exhibits almost no solubility. The electrochemical dissolution of metal oxides is strongly dependent on the proton activity from the HBD, i.e. capability of the protons to act as oxygen acceptors, and on the temperature. It has been reported that eutectic ionic fluids of lower pH-values, such as ChCl:oxalic acid and ChCl:lactic acid, allow a better solubility than that of higher pH (e.g., ChCl:acetic acid). Hence, different solubilities can be obtained by using, for instance, different carboxylic acids as HBD.

=== Outlook ===
Currently, the stability of most ionic liquids under practical electrochemical conditions is unknown, and the fundamental choice of ionic fluid is still empirical as there is almost no data on metal ion thermodynamics to feed into solubility and speciation models. Also, there are no Pourbaix diagrams available, no standard redox potentials, and bare knowledge of speciation or pH-values. It must be noticed that most processes reported in the literature involving ionic fluids have a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 (experimental proof-of-concept) or 4 (technology validated in the lab), which is a disadvantage for short-term implementation. However, ionometallurgy has the potential to effectively recover metals in a more selective and sustainable way, as it considers environmentally benign solvents, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and avoidance of corrosive and harmful reagents.

<text>London Bridge is an offshore natural arch in the Port Campbell National Park, Australia. The arch is a significant tourist attraction along the Great Ocean Road near Port Campbell in Victoria. The stack was formed by a gradual process of erosion, and until 1990 formed a complete double-span natural bridge.

The span closer to the shoreline sparked comparisons with the nursery rhyme of the same name and collapsed unexpectedly on 15 January 1990, leaving two tourists stranded on the outer span before they were rescued by police helicopter. No one was injured in the event.

<text>A failed state is a state that has lost its ability to fulfill fundamental security and development functions, lacking effective control over its territory and borders. Common characteristics of a failed state include a government incapable of tax collection, law enforcement, security assurance, territorial control, political or civil office staffing, and infrastructure maintenance. When this happens, widespread corruption and criminality, the intervention of state and non-state actors, the appearance of refugees and the involuntary movement of populations, sharp economic decline, and military intervention from both within and outside the state are much more likely to occur.

Originating in the 1990s, the term was initially applied to characterize the situation in Somalia. The country descended into disorder following a coup that ousted its dictator, Siad Barre, in 1991, leading to internal conflicts among the country&#x27;s clans. In the early 2020s, Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Libya, Mali, Myanmar, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen have all been described as failed states. There are concerns that Venezuela may also be on the path to becoming a failed state in the near future. 

Various metrics have been developed to describe the level of governance of states, with significant variation among authorities regarding the specific level of government control needed to consider a state as failed. In 2023, the Fund for Peace, a think tank, identified twelve countries in its most susceptible categories on the Fragile States Index. Formally designating a state as &quot;failed&quot; can be a controversial decision with significant geopolitical implications.

== Definition and issues ==
The term &quot;Failed State&quot; originated in the 1990s, particularly in the context of Somalia&#x27;s turmoil after the overthrow of its dictator, Siad Barre, in 1991. The phrase gained prominence during the American-led intervention in Somalia in 1992. It was used to express concerns about the potential collapse of poor states into chaotic anarchy after the end of the Cold War, as highlighted by Robert Kaplan&#x27;s depiction of chaos in Liberia and Sierra Leone and his warning of a &quot;coming anarchy&quot; in various global regions.

According to the political theories of Max Weber, a state is defined as maintaining a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force within its borders. When this is broken (e.g., through the dominant presence of warlords, paramilitary groups, corrupt policing, armed gangs, or terrorism), the very existence of the state becomes dubious, and the state becomes a &quot;failed state&quot;. The difficulty of determining whether a government maintains &quot;a monopoly on the legitimate use of force&quot;, which includes the problems of the definition of &quot;legitimate&quot;, means it is not clear precisely when a state can be said to have &quot;failed&quot;. The problem of legitimacy can be solved by understanding what Weber intended by it. Weber explains that only the state has the means of production necessary for physical violence. This means that the state does not require legitimacy for achieving a monopoly on having the means of violence (&quot;de facto&quot;), but will need one if it needs to use it (&quot;de jure&quot;).

Typically, the term means that the state has been rendered ineffective and is not able to enforce its laws uniformly or provide basic goods and services to its citizens. The conclusion that a state is failing or has failed can be drawn from the observation of a variety of characteristics and combinations thereof. Examples of such characteristics include - but are not limited to - the presence of an insurgency, extreme political corruption, overwhelming crime rates suggestive of an incapacitated police force, an impenetrable and ineffective bureaucracy, judicial ineffectiveness, military interference in politics, and consolidation of power by regional actors such that it rivals or eliminates the influence of national authorities. Other factors of perception may be involved. A derived concept of &quot;failed cities&quot; has also been launched, based on the notion that while a state may function in general, polities at the substate level may collapse in terms of infrastructure, economy, and social policy. Certain areas or cities may even fall outside state control, becoming a &quot;de facto&quot; ungoverned part of the state.

No consistent or quantitative definition of a &quot;failed state&quot; exists; the subjective nature of the indicators that are used to infer state failure have led to an ambiguous understanding of the term.

Some scholars focus on the capacity and effectiveness of the government to determine whether or not a state is failed. Other indices such as the Fund for Peace&#x27;s Fragile States Index employ assessments of the democratic character of a state&#x27;s institutions as a means of determining its degree of failure. Finally, other scholars focus their argument on the legitimacy of the state, on the nature of the state, on the growth of criminal violence in a state, on the economic extractive institutions, or on the states&#x27; capacity to control its territory. Robert H. Bates refers to state failure as the &quot;implosion of the state&quot;, where the state transforms &quot;into an instrument of predation&quot; and the state effectively loses its monopoly on the means of force.
===Criticism of the concept===
Charles T. Call attempts to abandon the concept of state failure altogether, arguing that it promotes an unclear understanding of what state failure means. Instead, Call advances a &quot;gap framework&quot; as an alternative means of assessing the effectiveness of state administration. This framework builds on his previous criticism of the state failure concept as overly generalized. Call thus asserts that it is often inappropriately applied as a catch-all theory to explain the plight of states that are in fact subject to diverse national contexts and do not possess identical problems. Utilizing such an evaluation to support policy prescriptions, Call posits, is then responsible for poor policy formulation and outcomes. As such, Call&#x27;s proposed framework develops the concept of state failure through the codification of three &quot;gaps&quot; in resource provision that the state is not able to address when it is in the process of failure: capacity, when state institutions lack the ability to effectively deliver basic goods and services to its population; security, when the state is unable to provide security to its population under the threat of armed groups; and legitimacy when a &quot;significant portion of its political elites and society reject the rules regulating power and the accumulation and distribution of wealth.&quot;

Instead of attempting to quantify the degree of failure of a state, the gap framework provides a three-dimensional scope useful to analyze the interplay between the government and the society in states in a more analytical way. Call does not necessarily suggest that states that suffer from the challenges of the three gaps should be identified as failed states but instead presents the framework as an alternative to the state failure concept as a whole. Although Call recognizes that the gap concept in itself has limits since often states face two or more of the gap challenges, his conceptual proposition presents a useful way for more precisely identifying the challenges within a society and the policy prescriptions that are more likely to be effective for external and international actors to implement.

Further critique of the ways in which the &#x27;failed state&#x27; concept has been understood and used to inform national and international policy decisions is brought forth in research by Morten Bøås and Kathleen M. Jennings. Drawing on five case studies — Afghanistan, Somalia, Liberia, Sudan, and the Niger Delta region of Nigeria — Bøås and Jennings argue that &quot;the use of the &#x27;failed state&#x27; label is inherently political and based primarily on Western perceptions of Western security and interests&quot;. They go on to suggest that Western policy-makers attribute the &quot;failed&quot; label to those states in which &quot;recession and informalisation of the state is perceived to be a threat to Western interests&quot;. Furthermore, this suggests hypocrisy among Western policy-makers: the same forms of perceived dysfunction that lead to some states being labeled as failed are in turn met with apathy or are knowingly expedited in other states where such dysfunction is assessed to be beneficial to Western interests. In fact, &quot;this feature of state functioning is not only accepted, but also to a certain degree facilitated, as it creates an enabling environment for business and international capital. These cases are not branded &#x27;failed states.

== Measurement ==
The measurement methods of state failure are generally divided into the quantitative and qualitative approach.

===Quantitative approach===
Quantitative measurement of state failure often focuses on the developmental level of the state (e.g. the &quot;Freedom House Index&quot; (FHI), the &quot;Human Development Index&quot; (HDI), or the &quot;World Bank Governance Indicators&quot;). Additionally, regional evaluation might give concrete details about the level of democracy such as the Report of Democratic Development in Latin America (&quot;Informe de desarrollo democrático de América Latina&quot;).

==== Fragile States Index ====
The Fragile States Index, first published in 2005, measures &quot;failed state&quot; qualities more explicitly. Edited by the magazine &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;, the ranking examines 178 countries based on analytical research of the Conflict Assessment System Tool (CAST) of the Fund for Peace. In the 2015 report, written by the Fund for Peace, there are three groupings: social, economic, and political with overall of twelve indicators.

Social indicators:
* Demographic pressures
* Refugees or internally displaced persons
* Group grievance
* Human flight and brain drain

Economic indicators:
* Uneven economic development
* Poverty and economic decline

Political and military indicators:
* State legitimacy
* Public services
* Human rights and rule of law
* Security apparatus
* Factionalized elites
* External intervention

In the 2015 Index, South Sudan ranked number one, Somalia number two, and the Central African Republic number three. Finland was the most stable and sustainable country in the list.

While the FSI is used in many pieces of research and makes the categorization of states more pragmatic, it often receives much criticism for several reasons:
# It does not include the Human Development Index to reach the final score but instead focuses on institutions to measure what are often also considered human aspects for development.
# It parallels the fragility or vulnerability of states with underdevelopment. This comparison firstly assumes that underdevelopment (economic) creates vulnerability, thus assuming that if a state is &quot;developed&quot; it is stable or sustainable.
# It measures the failure (or success) of a state without including the progress of other areas outside the sphere of the 12 indicators, thus excluding important measures of development such as the decline in child mortality rates, and increased access to clean water sources and medication, amongst others.

FSI is used by governments, organizations, educators and analysts, sometimes to highlight the issues that cause threats.

=== Qualitative approach ===

The qualitative approach embraces theoretical frameworks. Normally, this type of measurement applies stage models to allow the categorization of states. In three to five stages, researchers show state failure as a process. Notable researchers, inter alia, are Robert I. Rotberg in the Anglo-American and Ulrich Schneckener in the German sphere.

Ulrich Schneckener&#x27;s (2006) stage model defines three core elements, monopoly of violence, legitimacy, and rule of law. The typology is based on the &quot;security first&quot; logic and thus, shows the relevance of the monopoly of violence in comparison to the other two while at the same time acting as the precondition for a functioning state. His four statehood types are: (1) consolidated and consolidating states, (2) weak states, (3) failing, and (4) collapsed/failed states. The first type is directed towards functioning states; all core functions of the state are functioning in the long term. In weak states, the monopoly of force is still intact, but the other two areas show serious deficits. Failing states lack the monopoly of force, while the other areas function at least partially. Finally, collapsed or failed states are dominated by parastatal structures characterized by actors trying to create a certain internal order, but the state cannot sufficiently serve the three core elements.

Both research approaches show some irregularities. While the quantitative approach lacks transparency concerning its indicators and their balancing in the evaluation process of countries, the qualitative approach shows a diversity of different foci. One of the major discrepancies is the question of whether all the stages have to be taken continuously or if a state can skip one phase. Schneckener stresses that his model should actually not be interpreted as a stage model as, in his opinion, states do not necessarily undergo every stage. Robert I. Rotberg&#x27;s model underlies an ordinal logic and thus, implies that the state failure process is a chronological chain of phases.

== Theoretical mechanisms for state development ==

=== State development through war-making ===
Charles Tilly (1985) argued that war-making was an indispensable aspect of state development in Europe through the following interdependent functions:
* War-making—rulers eliminate external rivals (requires building military forces and supportive bureaucracies)
* State-making—rulers eliminate internal rivals and establish control over their territories (requires building police forces and bureaucracies)
* Protection—rulers bring about benefit to their clients by eliminating their external rivals and guaranteeing their rights (requires building courts and representative assemblies)
* Extraction—rulers extract more tax from their subjects (requires building tax collection apparatuses and exchequers)
Tilly summarized this linkage in the famous phrase: &quot;War made the state, and the state made war.&quot;

Similarly, Herbst (1990) added that a war might be the only chance to strengthen an extraction capability since it forced rulers to risk their political lives for extra revenue and forced subjects to consent to pay more tax. It is also important for state development in that the increased revenue would not return to its original level even after the end of wars. Contrary to European states, however, he also pointed out that most Third World states lacked external threats and had not waged interstate wars, implying that these states are unlikely to take similar steps in the future.

=== &quot;Nation-building&quot; by developed countries ===
Steward and Knaus (2012) tackled the question &quot;Can intervention work?&quot; and concluded that &quot;we can help nations build themselves&quot; by putting an end to war and providing &quot;well-resourced humanitarian interventions&quot;. They criticized the overconfidence of policymakers on nation-building by contrasting what they regarded as successful interventions in Bosnia (1995) and Kosovo (1999) with the failed attempt of nation-building in Iraq (2003) and Afghanistan (2001–2021) in which the U.S. lost thousands of lives over ten years and expended more than a trillion dollars without realizing its central objective of nation-building. When a so-called failed nation-state is crushed by internal violence or disruption, and consequently is no longer able to deliver positive political goods to its inhabitants, developed states feel the obligation to intervene and assist in rebuilding them. However, intervention is not always seen positively, but due to past intervention by for instance the US government, scholars argue that the concept of a failed state is an invented rationale to impose developed states&#x27; interests on less powerful states.

The labeling of states like Somalia or Liberia, as failed states, gives Western countries the legitimization to impose the western idea of a stable nation-state. It is commonly accepted that nation-building or international response to troubled/rogue states happens too late or too quickly which is due to inadequate analysis or lack of political will. Still, it is important to highlight that developed nations and their aid institutions have had a positive impact on many failed states. Nation-building is context-specific and thus a countries&#x27; cultural-political, as well as social environment, needs to be carefully analyzed before intervening as a foreign state. The Western world has increasingly become concerned about failed states and sees them as threats to security. The concept of the failed state is thereafter often used to defend policy interventions by the West. Further, as Chesterman and Ignatieff et al. argue, regarding the duration of international action by developed states and international organizations, a central problem is that a crisis tends to be focused on time, while the most essential work of reframing and building up a state and its institutions takes years or decades. Therefore, effective state-building is a slow process and it is disingenuous to suggest otherwise to the domestic public.

=== Promoting development through foreign aid ===
Pritchett, Woolcock, and Andrews (2013) analyzed the systematic failure of the development of failed states. They defined &quot;state administrative capability for implementation&quot; as the key aspect of state development, and found out the mechanism in which failed states stumbled regardless of decades of development practices tried, billions of dollars spent, and alleged &quot;progress&quot; boasted. These countries adopted the following techniques which led to undermining it: 
# &quot;systemic isomorphic mimicry&quot;—disguising the dysfunction of states by simply mimicking the appearance of functional states. 
# &quot;premature load bearing&quot;—limited-capacity states being overloaded with &quot;unrealistic expectations&quot;.

In light of the fact that many of these countries would likely need centuries to reach the state capability of developed countries, they suggested creating &quot;context-specific institutions&quot;, promoting &quot;incremental reform process&quot;, and setting &quot;realistic expectations&quot; for attaining the goal of substantial development.

Foreign aid produces several unintended consequences when used to develop the institutional capacity of state. Donors will often delegate aid spending to recipient governments since they do not have the information or capacity to identify who is in the greatest need and how it can be best spent. The downside of this is that it can be captured by recipient governments and diverted either towards self-enrichment of incumbent elites or to establish and maintain clientelist networks to allow them to remain in power—for example, in Kenya, aid allocation is biased towards constituencies with high vote shares for the incumbent, so the geographic distribution of aid changes to their supporters following a change of regime. Furthermore, aid can also be diverted to non-state actors, and thus undermine the state&#x27;s monopoly on violence, such as in Colombia during the 1990s and 2000s, where US aid to the Colombian military was diverted by the military to paramilitary groups, leading to significant increases in paramilitary violence in municipalities located near military bases. The implication is that foreign aid can undermine the state by both feeding corruption of incumbent elites, and empowering groups outside of the state.

Moss, Todd, Gunilla Pettersson, and Nicolas Van de Walle (2006) acknowledged the controversy over the effect of foreign aid that has developed in recent years. They argued that although there is a call for an increase in large aid efforts in Africa by the international community, this will actually create what they call an &quot;aid-institutions paradox&quot;. This paradox is formed because of the large cash contributions that Western countries have given to African countries have created institutions that are &quot;less accountable to their citizens and under less pressure to maintain popular legitimacy.&quot; They mention that the gradual decrease of aid may help foster long-lasting institutions, which is proven by the United States&#x27; efforts in Korea after the Cold War.

Berman, Eli, Felter, Shapiro, and Trolan (2013) also found similar evidence to support the paradox, stating that large US aid attempts in African agriculture have only resulted in further conflict between citizens. Notably, small investments such as grants for schools have proven to decrease violence compared to large investments, which create &quot;incentives to capture economic rents through violence.&quot;

Furthermore, Binyavanga Wainaina (2009) likens Western aid to colonization, in which countries believe that large cash contributions to spur the African economy will lead to political development and less violence. In reality, these cash contributions do not invest in Africa&#x27;s growth economically, politically and most of all, socially.

=== Neotrusteeship ===
James Fearon and David Laitin suggest in &quot;Neotrusteeship and the Problem of Weak States&quot; that the problem of failed states can be addressed through a system of &quot;neotrusteeship&quot;, which they compare to &quot;postmodern imperialism&quot;. Fearon and Laitin&#x27;s idea of neotrusteeship involves a combination of international and domestic organizations which seek to rebuild states. Fearon and Laitin start with the assumption that failed states comprise a collective action problem. Failed states impose negative externalities on the rest of the international system, like refugees who are displaced by war. It would be a net good for the international system if countries worked to develop and rebuild failed states. However, intervention is very costly, and no single nation has a strong enough incentive to act to solve the problem of a failed state. Therefore, international cooperation is necessary to solve this collective action problem.

Fearon and Laitin identify four main problems to achieving collective action to intervene in failed states:
# Recruitment - getting countries to participate in and pay for interventions
# Coordination - providing good communication between all of the peacekeeping countries
# Accountability - ensuring that any peacekeeping countries that commit human rights abuses are held responsible
# Exit - having some mechanism for the peacekeeping countries to withdraw

Fearon and Laitin do propose some solutions to these problems. To solve the recruitment problem, they argue for having a powerful state with security interests in the failed state to take the lead in the peacekeeping operations and serve a point role. Having a single state lead the peacekeeping operation would also help solve the coordination problem. The empowerment of a UN body to investigate human rights abuses would solve the accountability problem. Finally, forcing the failed state to contribute funds to peacekeeping operations after several years can reduce the incentives of the peacekeepers to exit. Fearon and Laitin believe that multilateral interventions which solve the above four collective action problems will be more effective at rebuilding failed states through neotrusteeship.

=== Autonomous recovery ===
Jeremy Weinstein disagrees that peacekeeping is necessary to rebuild failed states, arguing that it is often better to allow failed states to recover on their own. Weinstein fears that international intervention may prevent a state from developing strong internal institutions and capabilities. One of Weinstein&#x27;s key arguments is that war leads to peace. By this, he means that peace agreements imposed by the international community tend to freeze in place power disparities that do not reflect reality. Weinstein believes that such a situation leaves a state ripe for future war, while if the war were allowed to play out for one side to win decisively, the future war would be much less likely. Weinstein also claims that war leads to the development of strong state institutions. Weinstein borrows from Charles Tilly to make this argument, which states that wars require large expansions in state capabilities, so the states that are more stable and capable will win wars and survive in the international system through a process similar to natural selection. Weinstein uses evidence from Uganda&#x27;s successful recovery following a guerilla victory in a civil war, Eritrea&#x27;s forceful secession from Ethiopia, and development in Somaliland and Puntland—autonomous regions of Somalia—to support his claims. Weinstein does note that lack of external intervention can lead to mass killings and other atrocities, but he emphasizes that preventing mass killings has to be weighed against the ensuing loss of long-term state capacity.

== Capability traps of failed states ==
Capability trap means that countries are progressing at a very slow pace in the expansion of state capability even in the contemporary world, which is also the core problem of failed states. Many countries remain stuck in conditions of low productivity that many call &quot;poverty traps&quot;. Economic growth is only one aspect of development; another key dimension of development is the expansion of the administrative capability of the state, the capability of governments to affect the course of events by implementing policies and programs. Capability traps close the space for novelty, establishing fixed best-practice agendas as the basis of evaluating failed states. Local agents are therefore excluded from the process of building their own states, implicitly undermining the value-creating ideas of local leaders and front-line workers.

Matt, Lant, and Woolcock from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government proposed an approach called the &quot;Problem Driven Iterative Adaptation (PDIA)&quot;, to escape the capability traps. Given that many development initiatives fail to improve performance because they promote &quot;isomorphic mimicry&quot;, PDIA focuses on solving locally nominated and prioritized performance problems of failed states. It involves pursuing development interventions that engage broad sets of local agents to ensure the reforms are politically supportable and practically implementable.

While failed states are the source of numerous refugees, the chaotic emigration allowed by UN regulations and open border policies have contributed to human capital flight, or brain drain. Without sufficient professional and skilled workers, such as doctors, nurses, biologists, engineers, electricians, and so on, the severity of failed states tends to increase, leading to even more emigration. Similarly, policies that do not require third country resettlement on the same continent as failed states make eventual resettlement after the war, famine, or political collapse even less probable, as the distance, cost, and inconvenience of returning to home countries increase with distance and language change among refugee families. In Somalia, Afghanistan, and Yemen the reform movements and modernization efforts are weakened when there are no effective refugee resettlement programs.

== Promoting good governance and combating further hostilities in failed states ==
=== Transnational crime and terrorism ===
According to U.S. Department of Justice Trial Attorney Dan E. Stigall, &quot;the international community is confronted with an increasing level of transnational crime in which criminal conduct in one country has an impact in another or even several others. Drug trafficking, human trafficking, computer crimes, terrorism, and a host of other crimes can involve actors operating outside the borders of a country which might have a significant interest in stemming the activity in question and prosecuting the perpetrator&quot;.

A study of the Cligendael Center for Strategic Studies explains why states that are subject to failure serve as sanctuaries (used to plan, execute, support, and finance activities) for terrorist organizations. When the government does not know about the presence of the organization or if it is not able to weaken or remove the organization, the sanctuary is referred to as a &quot;Terrorist Black Hole&quot;. However, next to governmental weakness there needs to be &quot;Terrorist Comparative Advantages&quot; present for a region to be considered as a &quot;Terrorist Black Hole&quot;. According to the study, social tensions, the legacy from civil conflict, geography, corruption and policy failure, as well as external factors contribute to governmental weakness. The comparative advantages are religion and ethnicity, the legacy from civil conflict, geography, economic opportunities, economic underdevelopment, and regional stimuli. Only the combinations of the two factors (governmental weakness and Terrorist Comparative Advantages) explain what regions terrorists use as sanctuaries.

Research by James Piazza of the Pennsylvania State University finds evidence that nations affected by state failure experience and produce more terrorist attacks. Contemporary transnational crimes &quot;take advantage of globalization, trade liberalization and exploding new technologies to perpetrate diverse crimes and to move money, goods, services and people instantaneously for purposes of perpetrating violence for political ends&quot;.

Contributing to previous research on the matter, Tiffiany Howard looks at a different dimension of the connection between state failure and terrorism, based on evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa. She argues that &quot;citizens of failed states are attracted to political violence because of the deteriorating conditions within this type of states&quot;. Focusing on individual citizens&#x27; decision-making patterns, it is suggested that &quot;individuals living in failed states are attracted to political violence because the system is broken—the state has failed in its duty&quot;. This finding is based on empirical evidence using barometer survey data. This individual-level approach, which differs from previous research which has focused on the attractiveness of failed states for terrorists and insurgents finds that &quot;failed states threaten an individual&#x27;s survival, which ultimately drives them to obtain tangible political and economic resources through other means, which include the use of political violence&quot;. This finding has significant implications for the international community, such as the fact that &quot;this pattern of deprivation makes individuals in these states more susceptible to the influence of internationally sponsored terrorist groups. As a consequence, failed states are breeding grounds for terrorists, who then export their radical ideologies to other parts of the world to create terrorist threats across the globe&quot;.

The link between state failure (and its characteristics) and terrorism, however, is not unanimously accepted in the scholarly literature. Research by Alberto Abadie, which looks at determinants of terrorism at the country level, suggests that the &quot;terrorist risk is not significantly higher for poorer countries, once the effects of other country-specific characteristics such as the level of political freedom are taken into account&quot;. In fact, as the argument goes, &quot;political freedom is shown to explain terrorism, but it does so in a non-monotonic way: countries in some intermediate range of political freedom are shown to be more prone to terrorism than countries with high levels of political freedom or countries with highly authoritarian regimes&quot;. While poverty and low levels of political freedom are not the main characteristics of failed states, they are nevertheless important ones. For this reason, Abadie&#x27;s research represents a powerful critique to the idea that there is a link between state failure and terrorism. This link is also questioned by other scholars, such as Corinne Graff, who argues that &#x27;there is simply no robust empirical relationship between poverty and terrorist attacks&#x27;.

Moreover, &quot;problems of weakened states and transnational crime create an unholy confluence that is uniquely challenging. When a criminal operates outside the territory of an offended state, the offended state might ordinarily appeal to the state from which the criminal is operating to take some sort of action, such as to prosecute the offender domestically or extradite the offender so that he or she may face punishment in the offended state. Nonetheless, in situations in which a government is unable (or unwilling) to cooperate in the arrest or prosecution of a criminal, the offended state has few options for recourse&quot;.

==Examples==
A relevant contribution to the field of failed states and its attributes was made by Jack Goldstone in his 2008 paper &quot;Pathways to State Failure&quot;. He defines a failed state as one that has lost both its effectiveness and legitimacy. Effectiveness means the capability to carry out state functions such as providing security or levying taxes. Legitimacy means the support of important groups of the population. A state that retains one of these two aspects is not failed as such; however, it is in great danger of failing soon if nothing is done. He identifies five possible pathways to state failure:
# Escalation of communal group (ethnic or religious) conflicts. Examples: Rwanda, SFR Yugoslavia
# State predation (corrupt or crony corralling of resources at the expense of other groups). Examples: Nicaragua, Philippines
# Regional or guerrilla rebellion. Examples: Colombia, Vietnam
# Democratic collapse (leading to civil war or coup d&#x27;état). Examples: Nigeria and Myanmar.
# Succession or reform crisis in authoritarian states. Examples: Indonesia under Suharto, the Soviet Union under Gorbachev.

Larry Diamond, in his 2006 paper &quot;Promoting democracy in post-conflict and failed states&quot;, argues that weak and failed states pose distinctive problems for democracy promotion. In these states, the challenge is not only to pressure authoritarian state leaders to surrender power but rather to figure out how to regenerate legitimate power in the first place. There are mainly two distinct types of cases, and each of these two types of cases requires specific kinds of strategies for the promotion of good governance:

# The post-conflict states that are emerging from external or civil war. A number of these countries, such as Nigeria, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and Somalia, have been in Africa, while others have been in Latin America (Nicaragua, El Salvador, and much of Central America), in Asia (e.g. Cambodia), or in the Middle East (Lebanon, Algeria, and Iraq);
# Countries that are in the midst of civil war or ongoing violent conflict, where central state authority has largely collapsed, as in the Democratic Republic of the Congo

Generally speaking, the order is the most important prerequisite for democracy promotion, which relies heavily on formal democratic mechanisms, particularly elections to promote post-conflict state-building. In the absence of an effective state, there are basically three possibilities. First, if there has been a civil war and a rebel force has ultimately triumphed, then the vacuum may be filled by the rebellious army and political movement as it establishes control over the state. Second, there may be a patchwork of warlords and armies, with either no real central state (as in Somalia) or only a very weak one. In this situation, the conflict does not really end, but may wax and wane in a decentralized fashion, as in Afghanistan today. The third possibility is that an international actor or coalition of actors steps in to constitute temporary authority politically and militarily. This may be an individual country, a coalition, an individual country under the thin veneer of a coalition, or the United Nations acting through the formal architecture of a UN post-conflict mission.

==Criticisms of the concept ==
The term &quot;failed state&quot; has faced criticism along two main strands. The first argues that the term lends itself to overgeneralization, by lumping together different governance problems amongst diverse countries, and without accounting for variations of governance within states. The second is concerned with the political application of the term in order to justify military interventions and state-building based on a Western model of the state.

Olivier Nay, William Easterly, and Laura Freschi have critiqued the concept of state failure as not having a coherent definition, with indices combining various indicators of state performance arbitrarily weighted to arrive at unclear and aggregated measurements of state fragility. Charles T. Call argues that the label of &quot;failed state&quot; has been applied so widely that it has been effectively rendered useless. As there has been little consensus over how to define failed states, the characteristics commonly used to identify a failing state are numerous and extremely diverse, from human rights violations, poverty, corruption to demographic pressures. This means that a wide range of highly divergent states are categorized together as failed (or failing) states. This can conceal the complexity of the specific weaknesses identified within individual states and result in one size fits all approach typically focused on strengthening the state&#x27;s capacity for order. Furthermore, the use of the term &#x27;failed state&#x27; has been used by some foreign powers as a justification for invading a country or determining a specific prescriptive set of foreign policy goals. Following 2001, Call notes that the US stated that failed states were one of the greatest security threats facing the country, based on the assumption that a country with weak – or non-existent – state institutions would provide a safe haven for terrorists, and act as a breeding ground for extremism.

Call suggests that, instead of branding countries as failed states, they could be categorized in more relevant, understandable terms. For example, a &quot;collapsed state&quot; would refer to a country where the state apparatus completely falls apart and ceases to exist for a couple of months. This would only apply to a country where absolutely no basic functions of the state were working, and non-state actors were carrying out such tasks. A &quot;weak state&quot; could be used for states whereby informal institutions carry out more of the public services and channeling of goods than formal state institutions. A &quot;war-torn&quot; state might not be functioning because of conflict, but this does not necessarily imply it is a collapsed state. Rotberg argued that all failed states are experiencing some form of armed conflict. However, the challenges to the state can be very different depending on the type of armed conflict, and whether it encompasses the country as a whole and large territories, or is specifically focused around one regional area. Another type of state that has been traditionally put under the umbrella term &quot;failed state&quot; could be an &quot;authoritarian state&quot;. While authoritarian leaders might come to power by violent means, they may ward off opposition once in power and as such ensure there is little violence within their regime. Call argues that the circumstances and challenges facing state-building in such regimes are very different from those posed in a state in civil war. These four alternative definitions highlight the many different circumstances that can lead a state to be categorized under the umbrella term of &quot;failed state&quot;, and the danger of adopting prescriptive one-size-fits-all policy approaches to very different situations. As a result of these taxonomical difficulties, Wynand Greffrath has posited a nuanced approach to &quot;state dysfunction&quot; as a form of political decay, which emphasizes qualitative theoretical analysis.

<text>The Gulf of California (), also known as the Sea of Cortés (&quot;Mar de Cortés&quot;) or Sea of Cortez, or less commonly as the Vermilion Sea (&quot;Mar Vermejo&quot;), is a marginal sea of the Pacific Ocean that separates the Baja California peninsula from the Mexican mainland. It is bordered by the states of Baja California, Baja California Sur, Sonora, and Sinaloa with a coastline of approximately . Rivers that flow into the Gulf of California include the Colorado, Fuerte, Mayo, Sinaloa, Sonora, and the Yaqui. The surface of the gulf is about . Maximum depths exceed because of the complex geology, linked to plate tectonics.

The gulf is thought to be one of the most diverse seas on Earth and is home to more than 5,000 species of micro-invertebrates. Parts of the Gulf of California are a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Geography==

===History===
The marine expeditions of Fortún Ximénez, Hernán Cortés, Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, Francisco de Ulloa, Hernando de Alarcón, Captain Francisco de Lucenilla, and Sebastián Vizcaíno document its earliest record. Juan de Oñate reached the gulf overland in 1605 by following the Colorado River. In the 19th century Duflot de Mofras of France and C.H. Gilbert of the United States Fish Commission visited the area.

===Area===
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the southern limit of the gulf as: &quot;A line joining Piaxtla Point (latitude 23°38&#x27;N) on the west coast of the mainland of Mexico, and the southern extreme of Lower California&quot;.

The gulf is long and wide, with an area of , a mean depth of , and a volume of .

The Gulf of California is divided into three faunal regions: Northern, Central, and Southern.

One recognized transition zone is termed the Southwestern Baja California peninsula. Transition zones exist between faunal regions, and they usually vary for each individual species. (Faunal regions are distinguishable based on the specific types of animals found there.)

===Geology===

Geologic evidence is widely interpreted by geologists as indicating the gulf came into being around 5.3 million years ago as tectonic forces rifted the Baja California peninsula off the North American Plate. As part of this process, the East Pacific Rise propagated up the middle of the Gulf along the seabed. This extension of the East Pacific Rise is often referred to as the Gulf of California Rift Zone. The Gulf would extend as far as Indio, California, except for the tremendous delta created by the Colorado River. This delta blocks the sea from flooding the Mexicali and Imperial Valleys. Volcanism dominates the East Pacific Rise. The island of Isla Tortuga is one example of this ongoing volcanic activity. Furthermore, hydrothermal vents due to extension tectonic regime, related to the opening of the gulf, are found in the Bahía de Concepción, Baja California Sur.

===Islands===

The gulf contains 37 major islands, the two largest being Isla Ángel de la Guarda and Isla Tiburón. Most of the islands are found on the west side of the gulf. In fact, many of the islands of the gulf are the result of volcanic eruptions that occurred during the early history of Baja California. The islands of Islas Marías, Islas San Francisco, and Isla Partida are thought to be the result of such eruptions. The formations of the islands, however, are not dependent on each other. They were each formed as a result of an individual structural occurrence. Several islands, including Isla Coronados, are home to volcanoes. The Colorado River Delta contains several islands, such as Isla Montague.

The gulf has more than 900 islets and islands which together total about 420 hectares. All of them as a whole were enacted as &quot;Area Reserve and Migratory Bird Refuge and Wildlife&quot; on August 2, 1978. In June 2000, the islands were designated a flora and fauna protection area. In addition to this effort by the Mexican government, for its importance and recognition worldwide, all islands in the gulf are also part of the international program &quot;Man and Biosphere&quot; (MAB) and are part of the World Reserve Network UNESCO Biosphere as Special Biosphere Reserve. Because of the vast expanse covered by this federal protected area, conservation and management is carried out through a system of four regional directorates (one per state bordering the Gulf of California). The work of direct and indirect conservation done in the islands is governed by a single management program, published in 2000, which is complemented by local and specific management programs. The Directorate of Protection Area Wildlife California Gulf Islands in Baja California is responsible for 56 islands located off the coast of the state. These are grouped into four archipelagos: San Luis Gonzaga or Enchanted, Guardian Angel, Bahía de los Ángeles and San Lorenzo.

===Shores and tides===
The three general types of shores found in the gulf include rocky shore, sandy beach, and tidal flat.

Some of the rich biodiversity and high endemism that characterize the gulf and make it such a hotspot for fishing can be attributed to seemingly insignificant factors, such as the types of rocks that make up a shore. Beaches with softer, more porous rocks (such as coquina limestone, rhyolites, granite, or diorite) generally have a higher species richness than those with harder, smoother rocks (such as basalt or diabase). Porous rocks will naturally have more cracks and crevices in them, making them ideal living spaces for many animals. The rocks themselves, however, generally need to be stable on the shore for a habitat to be stable. Additionally, the color of the rocks can affect the organisms living on a shore. For example, darker rocks will be significantly warmer than lighter ones, and can deter animals that do not have a high tolerance for heat.

The northern gulf experiences tidal ranges of up to . Mixed semidiurnal tides are the norm throughout most of the Gulf.

===Estuaries===
There are a number of negative estuaries, that is, ones in which the evaporation of seawater is relatively greater than that of the fresh water input. The salinities of these inlets are higher than that of the ocean. The temperatures, poikilothermal, of these negative estuaries also are higher than the general temperature of the gulf. It is possible that at one time these estuaries were positive, that is, ones in which the seawater component is diluted; therefore, the water is brackish, with salinity less than that of the ocean. However, because of human settlement around the gulf and water diversion for municipal and agricultural use in an area of comparatively low rainfall, there are no longer many rivers that freely empty into the gulf. The upper Colorado River Delta is one example of a historically major estuary and wetlands ecosystem, that since the 20th century construction of upriver dams and diversion aqueducts on the Colorado River, is now a small ephemeral remnant estuary. The remaining gulf inlets still are important to several species of fishes, crustaceans, and shellfish that are commercially harvested.

==Climate==

===Air===
Even though the shores of the gulf are generally sheltered from the continuous wave shock that is experienced by most other North American shores, storms known as a &quot;chubasco&quot; can cause significant damage to shorelines, despite their brevity.

===Ocean===
The depth of the water helps to determine its temperature. For example, shallow depths are directly influenced by the local temperature of the air, while deeper waters are less susceptible to changes in air temperature. The temperature of the water in the gulf generally experiences lows of in winter and highs of in summer. But temperatures can vary greatly in the gulf, and the water is almost always warmer by the coast than the open ocean. For example, the waters surrounding La Paz reach in August, while the waters in neighboring city Cabo San Lucas, only reach .

Occasionally, the northern gulf will go through significantly cold winters. The water in the northern gulf can sometimes drop below , which can lead to a large die-off of marine organisms. The animals most susceptible to the large decrease in water temperature include macroscopic algae and plankton.



==Marine life==

The narrow sea is home to a rich ecosystem. In addition to a wide range of endemic creatures, such as the critically endangered vaquita and various species of sea urchin, it also hosts many migratory species, such as the humpback whale, California gray whale, killer whale, manta ray, Humboldt squid and leatherback sea turtle, and the world&#x27;s largest animal, the blue whale. The unusual resident populations of fin whales and sperm whales do not migrate annually. The area near the Colorado River Delta has a small remnant population of totoaba. This region has historically been a magnet for world-class sport fishing activities, with a rich history of sporting world records. The region also has a rich history as a commercial fishery. However, the data vary wildly according to the species being studied, and the gulf&#x27;s ability to recuperate after years of overfishing remains uncertain. Moreover, changes in terrestrial ecology, such as the vast reduction in flow from the Colorado River into the gulf, have negatively affected fisheries, particularly in the northern region.

The gulf sustains a large number of marine mammals, many of which are rare and endangered. Its more than 900 islands are important nesting sites for thousands of seabirds, and its waters are primary breeding, feeding, and nursing grounds for myriad migratory and resident fish species. For decades, the gulf has been a primary source of two of Mexico&#x27;s leading marine resources, sardines and anchovies. Water pollution is a problem in the gulf, but the more immediate concerns are overfishing and bottom trawling, which destroys eelgrass beds and shellfish.

Efforts by the Mexican government to create conservation zones and nature reserves have been hampered by lack of enforcement resources as well as a lack of a political consensus on this issue of conservation of the Gulf. This occurs even though significant areas are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The thousands of miles of coastline are remote and difficult to police, and the politically powerful commercial fishing industry has been slow to embrace even economically viable conservation measures. Conservation of the gulf&#x27;s fisheries and coastlines is also complicated by a long history of overcapitalization in the sector, and the direct, often negative, impacts that conservation measures have on the livelihoods of Mexico&#x27;s coastal inhabitants. At present, the Mexican government and business interests have promoted a macro-level, tourist development vision for the gulf, the impacts of which on local ecology and society are uncertain. In 2019, the gulf was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger because of concerns of the imminent extinction of the vaquita, an endemic porpoise in the area.

Coastal communities are highly reliant on both commercial and sport fishing, including San Felipe, San Carlos, Cabo San Lucas, La Paz, Loreto, Guaymas, Bahía Kino, Puerto Peñasco, Topolobampo and Mulegé. The well-developed shrimp and sardine fleets of Mazatlán, on the Mexican mainland&#x27;s Pacific coast, heavily exploit the commercial fisheries of the southern gulf.

Many marine organisms can survive only within a particular salinity range, which makes salinity a notable factor in determining the types of potentially commercial organisms found in the gulf. The mean annual ranges of salinity of the Sea of Cortez are between 3.5 and 3.58% at the surface. Furthermore, the salinity of the water of the northern gulf is generally higher than the central and southern faunal regions due to the increased amount of evaporation that occurs in that region.

Locals have alleged the existence of a giant creature known as the &quot;Black Demon&quot; () of the Sea of Cortez. It is usually considered to be a black shark, and less commonly as a whale, measuring about and weighing , similar to the estimated length of the megalodon. It is one of a number of alleged cases of giant sharks in the Pacific Ocean, made throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.

<text>The World Cotton Centennial (also known as the World&#x27;s Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition) was a World&#x27;s Fair held in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States, in 1884. At a time when nearly one third of all cotton produced in the United States was handled in New Orleans and the city was home to the New Orleans Cotton Exchange, the idea for the fair was first advanced by the Cotton Planters Association. The name &quot;World Cotton Centennial&quot; referred to the earliest-surviving record of export of a shipment of cotton from the U.S. to England in 1784.

==History==
The U.S. Congress lent $1 million to the fair&#x27;s directors and gave $300,000 for the construction of a large U.S. Government &amp; State Exhibits Hall on the site. However, the planning and construction of the fair was marked by corruption and scandals, and state treasurer Edward A. Burke absconded abroad with some $1,777,000 of state money including most of the fair&#x27;s budget. Despite such serious financial difficulties, the Fair succeeded in offering many attractions to visitors.
The Centennial covered , stretching from St. Charles Avenue to the Mississippi River, and was notable in that it could be entered directly by railway, steamboat, or ocean-going ship. The main building enclosed and was the largest roofed structure constructed up to that time. It was illuminated with 5,000 electric lights (still a novelty at the time, and said to be ten times the number then existing in New Orleans outside of the fairgrounds). There was also a Horticultural Hall, an observation tower with electric elevators, and working examples of multiple designs of experimental electric street-cars. The Mexican exhibit was particularly lavish and popular, constructed at a cost of $200,000, and featuring a huge brass band that was a great hit locally.

On December 16, 1884, U.S. President Chester Arthur opened the fair via telegraph (two weeks behind schedule). It closed on June 2, 1885. In an unsuccessful attempt to recover some of the financial losses from the Fair, the grounds and structures were reused for the North Central &amp; South American Exposition from November 10, 1885, to March 31, 1886, with little success. The term &quot;Pan-American&quot; was not used in the fair&#x27;s title, since it was just coming into popular use in the press in the late 1880s. After this the structures were publicly auctioned off, most going only for their worth in scrap.

The site today is Audubon Park and Audubon Zoo in Uptown New Orleans.

<text>Dalmatic or Dalmatico-Romance (; ) was a group of Romance varieties that developed along the coast of Dalmatia. Over the centuries they were increasingly influenced, and then supplanted, by Croatian and Venetian.

It has not been demonstrated that Dalmatic belonged to a larger branch of Romance or even that its varieties constituted a valid genetic grouping of their own.

Dalmatic language should not be confused to modern Croatian dialect called &quot;Dalmatian&quot;, which is spoken on most part of Adriatic coast of Croatia.

== Varieties ==

=== Ragusan ===
This was spoken in Dubrovnik (). Various Ragusan words are known from local documents in Latin and Venetian. One such document, for instance, records the words , , , and indicates the meanings &#x27;bread&#x27;, &#x27;father&#x27;, &#x27;house&#x27;, &#x27;to do&#x27;. There are also some 14th-century texts in Ragusan, but these show extensive Croatian and Venetian influence, to the point that it is difficult to discern which if any of their features are genuinely Dalmatian.

A notable feature of Ragusan was its preservation (without palatalisation) of Latin and before front vowels, which can be seen in attested forms like &lt; Latin .

In the Republic of Ragusa, official business was conducted in Ragusan until approximately the end of the 15th century. In 1472 the Senate famously banned the use (without permission) of &quot;Slavic&quot; or &quot;any language other than Ragusan or Italian&quot; for conducting legal disputes. Another piece of evidence is a letter by Elio Lampridio Cerva (1463–1520) that mentions &quot;I remember how, when I was a boy, old men would carry on legal business in the Romance language that was called Ragusan&quot;.

=== Vegliote ===

This was spoken in Krk (, ). It is documented from the 19th century, in large part thanks to the efforts of the linguist Matteo Bartoli and his informant Tuone Udaina. When they first met, Udaina had not spoken Vegliote in two decades and could only produce a sort of &#x27;Dalmatianised&#x27; Venetian. As their interviews went on, he was able to recall more and more Vegliote from his youth, albeit in a form still tinged by his Venetian.

Like Ragusan, Vegliote did not participate in the broader Romance palatalisation of and before front vowels. (Compare Vegliote &quot;cold&quot; and Italian &lt; Latin .) Nevertheless it appears to have undergone a later, and independent, palatalisation of to before the sounds , as in the word &quot;arse&quot; &lt; * &lt; * &lt; .

It was once thought that Vegliote, like Romanian, showed the sound-change &gt; , but the only example of this is &quot;eight&quot; &lt; , which was probably affected by analogy with &quot;seven&quot; &lt; .

==== Sample ====
From Udaina. Stress-marks have been omitted.
* &quot;When those eight old-timers were still alive I would speak Vegliote with everyone because I&#x27;d learnt it when I was little. I was three years old when I began to speak like that in Vegliote, because my grandmother taught me, and my mum and dad would speak like that in Vegliote. They would speak [in Vegliote] because they thought I didn&#x27;t understand, but I understood all those words they were saying in Vegliote. My grandma would tell me &#x27;Wait just a bit for daddy to come home and I&#x27;ll tell him to spank you&#x27;&quot;.

=== Others ===
Dalmatic would also have been spoken on major islands and in towns along the Adriatic coast, namely Cres, Rab, Zadar, Trogir, Split, Kotor.

== Survival as a substrate ==
Likely &#x27;Dalmatisms&#x27; in Croatian include:

* The toponyms Cavtat &lt; ; Cres &lt; ; Krk &lt; ; Makar(ska) &lt; ; Split &lt; ; Labin &lt; ; Solin &lt; ; Lovran &lt; ; Supetar &lt; ; Sutomore &lt; 
* Words in the Dubrovnik dialect like &quot;onion&quot; &lt; ; &quot;pillar&quot; &lt; ; &quot;fringe&quot; &lt; ; &quot;lye&quot; &lt; ; &quot;oil-lamp&quot; &lt; ; &quot;barge-pole&quot; &lt; ; &quot;snapper&quot; &lt; ; &quot;liver&quot; &lt; ; &quot;to roast&quot; &lt; ; &quot;low tide&quot; &lt; ; &quot;drag-net&quot; &lt; ; &quot;seabream&quot; &lt; 
* Words in Standard Croatian like &quot;mast&quot; &lt; ; &quot;tavern&quot; &lt; ; ~~ &quot;squid&quot; &lt;

<doc id="145088" wikidata="Q194450" url="?curid=145088" title="Thermopylae">
<text>Thermopylae (; ; , ; ; &quot;hot gates&quot;) is a narrow pass and modern town in Lamia, Phthiotis, Greece. It derives its name from its hot sulphur springs. In Greek mythology the Hot Gates is one of the entrances to Hades.

Thermopylae is the site of the Battle of Thermopylae between the Greek forces (including Spartans, Thebans and Thespians) and the invading Persian forces, commemorated by Simonides of Ceos in the epitaph, &quot;Go tell the Spartans, stranger passing by, That here we lie, having answered our common oaths.&quot; Thermopylae is the only land route large enough to bear any significant traffic between Lokris and Thessaly. To go from north to south along the east coast of the Balkans requires use of the pass.
In ancient times it was called Malis, named after the Malians (), a Greek tribe that lived near present-day Lamia at the delta of the river Spercheios in Greece. The Malian Gulf is also named after them. In the western valley of the Spercheios their land was adjacent to the Aenianes. Their main town was named Trachis. In the town of Anthela, the Malians had an important Temple of Demeter Amphictyonis, an early center of the Anthelan Amphictyony.

The land is dominated by the coastal floodplain of the Spercheios river and is surrounded by sloping forested limestone mountains. There is continuous deposition of sediment from the river and travertine deposits from the hot springs which has substantially altered the landscape during the past few thousand years. The land surface on which the famous Battle of Thermopylae was fought in 480 BC is now buried under of soil. The shoreline has also advanced over the centuries because of the sedimentary deposition. The level of the Malian Gulf was also significantly higher during prehistoric times, and the Spercheios River was significantly shorter. Its shoreline advanced by up to 2 kilometers between 2500 BC and 480 BC but has still left several narrow passages between the sea and the mountains. The narrowest point on the plain, where the battle was probably fought, would have been less than wide. Between 480 BC and the 21st century, the shoreline advanced by as much as in places, eliminating the narrowest points of the pass and considerably increasing the size of the plain around the outlet of the Spercheios.

The A1 motorway linking Athens and Thessaloniki now follows the ancient shoreline and thus splits the pass; a modern-day monument to King Leonidas I of Sparta is situated on the east side of the highway, directly across the road from the hill where Simonides&#x27; epitaph to the fallen is engraved in stone at the top. Thermopylae is part of the &quot;horseshoe of Maliakos&quot;, also known as the &quot;horseshoe of death&quot;: it is the narrowest part of the highway connecting the north and the south of Greece. It has many turns and has been the site of many vehicular accidents.
The hot springs from which the pass derives its name still exist close to the foot of the hill.

== Origin ==
Thermopylae means &quot;hot gates&quot;, referring to the area’s hot sulfur springs. The location was also associated with the cavernous entrance to Hades, the underworld in Greek mythology, which was said to be at Thermopylae. According to one version of the Labours of Heracles, it was said that the waters at Thermopylae became hot because the divine hero Heracles tried to cleanse himself of the Hydra&#x27;s poison there.

The first known Amphictyony, a group of religiously associated ancient Greek tribes, was centered on the cult of Demeter at the city of Anthela, near Thermopylae. The delegates to this first Amphictyony were dubbed the &quot;Pylagorai&quot; (&quot;gate-assemblers&quot;); since Demeter had chthonic or underworld associations in many of her older cults, this may be a reference to the gates of Hades.

== Battles ==

=== Greco-Persian Wars ===

Thermopylae is primarily known for the battle that took place there in 480 BC, in which an outnumbered Greek force probably of 7,000 (including 300 Spartans, 500 warriors from Tegea, 500 from Mantinea, 120 from Arcadian Orchomenos, 1,000 from the rest of Arcadia, 200 from Phlius, 80 from Mycenae, 400 Corinthians, 400 Thebans, 1,000 Phocians, 700 Thespians, and the Opuntian Locrians) held off a substantially larger force of Persians under Xerxes. Over 1,000 Greeks remained in the pass when most of the army retreated: the survivors from previous fighting of 300 Spartans and 700 Thespians, along with 400 Thebans whom the other Greeks forcibly held as hostages. Gaius Stern has argued that this force had already suffered casualties of over 100 in the previous fighting, so the true number might be closer to 1,250 than 1,400.

For three days they held a narrow route between hills and the sea against Xerxes&#x27; vast cavalry and infantry force, before being outflanked on the third day via an obscure goat path named the Anopaea Pass. According to the Greek legend, a traitor named Ephialtes of Trachis showed the path to the invaders. The following epitaph by Simonides was written on the monument: &quot;Go tell the Spartans, stranger passing by, that here obedient to their laws we lie.&quot; (Ὦ ξεῖν&#x27;, ἀγγέλλειν Λακεδαιμονίοις ὅτι τῇδε κείμεθα, τοῖς κείνων ῥήμασι πειθόμενοι.)

=== Third Sacred War ===
In 353 BC/352 BC during the Third Sacred War, fought mainly between the forces of the Delphic Amphictyonic League, principally represented by Thebes, and latterly by Philip II of Macedon, and the Phocians. The war was caused by a large fine imposed on the Phocians in 357 BC for cultivating sacred land. The Spartans, who were also fined in that war, actually never fought in it as they were later pardoned.

=== Gallic invasion of the Balkans ===

In 279 BC a Gallic army led by Brennus initially engaged the Aetolians who were forced to make a tactical retreat and who were finally routed by the Thessalians and Malians by the river Spercheios.

=== Roman-Seleucid Wars ===

In 191 BC Antiochus III the Great of Syria attempted in vain to hold the pass against the Romans under Manius Acilius Glabrio.

=== Balkan invasion by the Heruli ===

At an uncertain date in the mid 3rd century AD, the Germanic tribe of Heruli were defeated by a Roman force sent to stop them.

=== Byzantine-Bulgarian Wars ===

In 997, the Bulgarian Tsar Samuel invaded Greece and advanced as far as the Peloponnese. On his return, he was met by a Byzantine army under Nikephoros Ouranos at Spercheios. As the river was flooded, both sides encamped on opposite sides without action. Confident that the Byzantines could not cross the river, the Bulgarians relaxed their guard and were taken by surprise when Byzantine scouts discovered a ford further upriver.

=== Greek War of Independence ===

In 1821, a force of Greek fighters led by Athanasios Diakos made a stand near the pass to stop a force of 8,000 Turks from marching down from Thessaly to put down revolts in Roumeli and the Peloponnese. Diakos, after making a last stand at the bridge of Alamana with 48 of his men, was captured and killed.

=== World War II ===

In 1941 during World War II the ANZAC forces delayed the invading Nazi forces in the area enough to allow the evacuation of the British expeditionary force to Crete. This conflict also became known as the Battle of Thermopylae. The sabotage of the Gorgopotamos bridge in 1942 was referred in German documents of the era as &quot;the recent sabotage near Thermopylae&quot;.

<text>A blacksmith is a metalsmith who creates objects primarily from wrought iron or steel, but sometimes from other metals, by forging the metal, using tools to hammer, bend, and cut (cf. tinsmith). Blacksmiths produce objects such as gates, grilles, railings, light fixtures, furniture, sculpture, tools, agricultural implements, decorative and religious items, cooking utensils, and weapons. There was a historical distinction between the heavy work of the blacksmith and the more delicate operations of a whitesmith, who usually worked in gold, silver, pewter, or the finishing steps of fine steel. The place where a blacksmith works is variously called a smithy, a forge, or a blacksmith&#x27;s shop.

While there are many professions who work with metal, such as farriers, wheelwrights, and armorers, in former times the blacksmith had a general knowledge of how to make and repair many things, from the most complex of weapons and armor to simple things like nails or lengths of chain.
==Etymology==
The &quot;black&quot; in &quot;blacksmith&quot; refers to the black firescale, a layer of oxides that forms on the surface of the metal during heating. The origin of smith is the Old English word meaning &quot;blacksmith&quot;, originating from the Proto-Germanic &quot;*smiþaz&quot; meaning &quot;skilled worker&quot;.

==Smithing process==
Blacksmiths work by heating pieces of wrought iron or steel until the metal becomes soft enough for shaping with hand tools, such as a hammer, an anvil and a chisel. Heating generally takes place in a forge fueled by propane, natural gas, coal, charcoal, coke, or oil.

Some modern blacksmiths may also employ an oxyacetylene or similar blowtorch for more localized heating. Induction heating methods are gaining popularity among modern blacksmiths.

Color is important for indicating the temperature and workability of the metal. As iron heats to higher temperatures, it first glows red, then orange, yellow, and finally white. The ideal heat for most forging is the bright yellow-orange color that indicates &quot;forging heat&quot;. Because they must be able to see the glowing color of the metal, some blacksmiths work in dim, low-light conditions, but most work in well-lit conditions. The key is to have consistent lighting, but not too bright. Direct sunlight obscures the colors.

The techniques of smithing can be roughly divided into forging (sometimes called &quot;sculpting&quot;), welding, heat-treating, and finishing.

===Forging===
Forging—the process smiths use to shape metal by hammering—differs from machining in that forging does not remove material. Instead, the smith hammers the iron into shape. Even punching and cutting operations (except when trimming waste) by smiths usually re-arrange metal around the hole, rather than drilling it out as swarf.

Forging uses seven basic operations or techniques:

* Drawing down
* Shrinking (a type of upsetting)
* Bending
* Upsetting
* Swaging
* Punching
* Forge welding

These operations generally require at least a hammer and anvil, but smiths also use other tools and techniques to accommodate odd-sized or repetitive jobs.

====Drawing====

Drawing lengthens the metal by reducing one or both of the other two dimensions. As the depth is reduced, or the width narrowed, the piece is lengthened or &quot;drawn out.&quot;

As an example of drawing, a smith making a chisel might flatten a square bar of steel, lengthening the metal, reducing its depth but keeping its width consistent.

Drawing does not have to be uniform. A taper can result as in making a wedge or a woodworking chisel blade. If tapered in two dimensions, a point results.

Drawing can be accomplished with a variety of tools and methods. Two typical methods using only hammer and anvil would be hammering on the anvil horn, and hammering on the anvil face using the cross peen of a hammer.

Another method for drawing is to use a tool called a fuller, or the peen of the hammer, to hasten the drawing out of a thick piece of metal. (The technique is called fullering from the tool.) Fullering consists of hammering a series of indentations with corresponding ridges, perpendicular to the long section of the piece being drawn. The resulting effect looks somewhat like waves along the top of the piece. Then the smith turns the hammer over to use the flat face to hammer the tops of the ridges down level with the bottoms of the indentations. This forces the metal to grow in length (and width if left unchecked) much faster than just hammering with the flat face of the hammer.

=== Bending ===

Heating iron to a &quot;forging heat&quot; allows bending as if it were a soft, ductile metal, like copper or silver.

Bending can be done with the hammer over the horn or edge of the anvil or by inserting a bending fork into the hardy hole (the square hole in the top of the anvil), placing the work piece between the tines of the fork, and bending the material to the desired angle. Bends can be dressed and tightened, or widened, by hammering them over the appropriately shaped part of the anvil.

Some metals are &quot;hot short&quot;, meaning they lose their tensile strength when heated. They become like Plasticine: although they may still be manipulated by squeezing, an attempt to stretch them, even by bending or twisting, is likely to have them crack and break apart. This is a problem for some blade-making steels, which must be worked carefully to avoid developing hidden cracks that would cause failure in the future. Though rarely hand-worked, titanium is notably hot short. Even such common smithing processes as decoratively twisting a bar are impossible with it.

=== Upsetting ===
Upsetting is the process of making metal thicker in one dimension through shortening in the other. One form is to heat the end of a rod and then hammer on it as one would drive a nail: the rod gets shorter, and the hot part widens. An alternative to hammering on the hot end is to place the hot end on the anvil and hammer on the cold end.

=== Punching ===
Punching may be done to create a decorative pattern, or to make a hole. For example, in preparation for making a hammerhead, a smith would punch a hole in a heavy bar or rod for the hammer handle. Punching is not limited to depressions and holes. It also includes cutting, slitting, and drifting—all done with a chisel.

==== Combining processes ====
The five basic forging processes are often combined to produce and refine the shapes necessary for finished products. For example, to fashion a cross-peen hammer head, a smith would start with a bar roughly the diameter of the hammer face: the handle hole would be punched and drifted (widened by inserting or passing a larger tool through it), the head would be cut (punched, but with a wedge), the peen would be drawn to a wedge, and the face would be dressed by upsetting.

As with making a chisel, since it is lengthened by drawing it would also tend to spread in width. A smith would therefore frequently turn the chisel-to-be on its side and hammer it back down—upsetting it—to check the spread and keep the metal at the correct width.

Or, if a smith needed to put a 90-degree bend in a bar and wanted a sharp corner on the outside of the bend, they would begin by hammering an unsupported end to make the curved bend. Then, to &quot;fatten up&quot; the outside radius of the bend, one or both arms of the bend would need to be pushed back to fill the outer radius of the curve. So they would hammer the ends of the stock down into the bend, &#x27;upsetting&#x27; it at the point of the bend. They would then dress the bend by drawing the sides of the bend to keep the correct thickness. The hammering would continue—upsetting and then drawing—until the curve had been properly shaped. In the primary operation was the bend, but the drawing and upsetting are done to refine the shape.

=== Welding ===
Welding is the joining of the same or similar kind of metal.

A modern blacksmith has a range of options and tools to accomplish this. The basic types of welding commonly employed in a modern workshop include traditional forge welding as well as modern methods, including oxyacetylene and arc welding.

In forge welding, the pieces to join are heated to what is generally referred to as &quot;welding heat&quot;. For mild steel most smiths judge this temperature by color: the metal glows an intense yellow or white. At this temperature the steel is near molten.

Any foreign material in the weld, such as the oxides or &quot;scale&quot; that typically form in the fire, can weaken it and cause it to fail. Thus the mating surfaces to be joined must be kept clean. To this end a smith makes sure the fire is a reducing fire: a fire where, at the heart, there is a great deal of heat and very little oxygen. The smith also carefully shapes mating faces so that as they come together foreign material squeezes out as the metal is joined. To clean the faces, protect them from oxidation, and provide a medium to carry foreign material out of the weld, the smith sometimes uses flux—typically powdered borax, silica sand, or both.

The smith first cleans parts to be joined with a wire brush, then puts them in the fire to heat. With a mix of drawing and upsetting the smith shapes the faces so that when finally brought together, the center of the weld connects first and the connection spreads outward under the hammer blows, pushing out the flux (if used) and foreign material.
The dressed metal goes back in the fire, is brought near to welding heat, removed from the fire, and brushed. Flux is sometimes applied, which prevents oxygen from reaching and burning the metal during forging, and it is returned to the fire. The smith now watches carefully to avoid overheating the metal. There is some challenge to this because, to see the color of the metal, the smith must remove it from the fire—exposing it to air, which can rapidly oxidize it. So the smith might probe into the fire with a bit of steel wire, prodding lightly at the mating faces. When the end of the wire sticks on to the metal, it is at the right temperature (a small weld forms where the wire touches the mating face, so it sticks). The smith commonly places the metal in the fire so he can see it without letting surrounding air contact the surface. (Note that smiths don&#x27;t always use flux, especially in the UK.)
Now the smith moves with rapid purpose, quickly taking the metal from the fire to the anvil and bringing the mating faces together. A few light hammer taps bring the mating faces into complete contact and squeeze out the flux—and finally, the smith returns the work to the fire. The weld begins with the taps, but often the joint is weak and incomplete, so the smith reheats the joint to welding temperature and works the weld with light blows to &quot;set&quot; the weld and finally to dress it to the shape.

=== Finishing ===
Depending on the intended use of the piece, a blacksmith may finish it in a number of ways:

* A simple jig (a tool) that the smith might only use a few times in the shop may get the minimum of finishing—a rap on the anvil to break off scale and a brushing with a wire brush.
* Files bring a piece to final shape, removing burrs and sharp edges, and smoothing the surface.
* Heat treatment and case-hardening achieve the desired hardness.
* The wire brush—as a hand tool or power tool—can further smooth, brighten, and polish surfaces.
* Grinding stones, abrasive paper, and emery wheels can further shape, smooth, and polish the surface.

A range of treatments and finishes can inhibit oxidation and enhance or change the appearance of the piece. An experienced smith selects the finish based on the metal and on the intended use of the item. Finishes include (among others): paint, varnish, bluing, browning, oil, and wax.

== Blacksmith&#x27;s striker ==

A blacksmith&#x27;s striker is an assistant (frequently an apprentice) whose job is to swing a large sledgehammer in heavy forging operations, as directed by the blacksmith. In practice, the blacksmith holds the hot iron at the anvil (with tongs) in one hand, and indicates where to strike the iron by tapping it with a small hammer in the other hand. The striker then delivers a heavy blow to the indicated spot with a sledgehammer. During the 20th century and into the 21st century, this role has become increasingly unnecessary and automated through the use of trip hammers or reciprocating power hammers.

== Blacksmith&#x27;s materials ==
When iron ore is smelted into usable metal, a certain amount of carbon is usually alloyed with the iron. (Charcoal is almost pure carbon.) The amount of carbon significantly affects the properties of the metal. If the carbon content is over 2%, the metal is called cast iron, because it has a relatively low melting point and is easily cast. It is quite brittle, however, and cannot be forged so therefore not used for blacksmithing. If the carbon content is between 0.25% and 2%, the resulting metal is tool steel, which can be heat treated as discussed above. When the carbon content is below 0.25%, the metal is either &quot;wrought iron (wrought iron is not smelted and cannot come from this process) &quot; or &quot;mild steel.&quot; The terms are never interchangeable. In preindustrial times, the material of choice for blacksmiths was wrought iron. This iron had a very low carbon content, and also included up to 5% of glassy iron silicate slag in the form of numerous very fine stringers. This slag content made the iron very tough, gave it considerable resistance to rusting, and allowed it to be more easily &quot;forge welded,&quot; a process in which the blacksmith permanently joins two pieces of iron, or a piece of iron and a piece of steel, by heating them nearly to a white heat and hammering them together. Forge welding is more difficult with modern mild steel, because it welds in a narrower temperature band. The fibrous nature of wrought iron required knowledge and skill to properly form any tool which would be subject to stress. Modern steel is produced using either the blast furnace or arc furnaces. Wrought iron was produced by a labor-intensive process called &quot;puddling&quot;, so this material is now a difficult-to-find specialty product. Modern blacksmiths generally substitute mild steel for making objects traditionally of wrought iron. Sometimes they use electrolytic-process pure iron.

== Other metals ==
Many blacksmiths also incorporate materials such as bronze, copper, or brass in artistic products. Aluminum and titanium may also be forged by the blacksmith&#x27;s process. Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin, while brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. Each material responds differently under the hammer and must be separately studied by the blacksmith.

== Terminology ==

* Iron is a naturally occurring metallic element. It is almost never found in its native form (pure iron) in nature. It is usually found as an oxide or sulfide, with many other impurity elements mixed in.
* Wrought iron is the purest form of iron generally encountered or produced in quantity. It may contain as little as 0.04% carbon (by weight). From its traditional method of manufacture, wrought iron has a fibrous internal texture. Quality wrought-iron blacksmithing takes the direction of these fibers into account during forging, since the strength of the material is stronger in line with the grain than across the grain. Most of the remaining impurities from the initial smelting become concentrated in silicate slag trapped between the iron fibers. This slag produces a lucky side effect during forge-welding. When the silicate melts, it makes wrought iron self-fluxing. The slag becomes a liquid glass that covers the exposed surfaces of the wrought iron, preventing oxidation which would otherwise interfere with the successful welding process.
* Steel is an alloy of iron and between 0.3% and 1.7% carbon by weight. The presence of carbon allows steel to assume one of several different crystalline configurations. Macroscopically, this is seen as the ability to &quot;turn the hardness of a piece of steel on and off&quot; through various processes of heat-treatment. If the concentration of carbon is held constant, this is a reversible process. Steel with a higher carbon percentage may be brought to a higher state of maximum hardness.
* Cast iron is iron that contains between 2.0% to 6% carbon by weight. There is so much carbon present that the hardness cannot be switched off. Hence, cast iron is a brittle metal, which can break like glass. Cast iron cannot be forged without special heat treatment to convert it to malleable iron.

Steel with less than 0.6% carbon content cannot be hardened enough by simple heat-treatment to make useful hardened-steel tools. Hence, in what follows, wrought-iron, low-carbon-steel, and other soft unhardenable iron varieties are referred to indiscriminately as just &quot;iron&quot;.

== History, prehistory, religion, and mythology ==
=== Mythology ===
In Hindu mythology, Tvastar also known as Vishvakarma is the blacksmith of the devas. The earliest references of Tvastar can be found in the Rigveda.

Hephaestus (Latin: Vulcan) was the blacksmith of the gods in Greek and Roman mythology. A supremely skilled artisan whose forge was a volcano, he constructed most of the weapons of the gods, as well as beautiful assistants for his smithy and a metal fishing-net of astonishing intricacy. He was the god of metalworking, fire, and craftsmen.

In Celtic mythology, the role of Smith is held by eponymous (their names do mean &#x27;smith&#x27;) characters : Goibhniu (Irish myths of the Tuatha Dé Danann cycle) or Gofannon (Welsh myths/ the Mabinogion). Brigid or Brigit, an Irish goddess, is sometimes described as the patroness of blacksmiths.

In the Nart mythology of the Caucasus the hero known to the Ossetians as Kurdalægon and the Circassians as Tlepsh is a blacksmith and skilled craftsman whose exploits exhibit shamanic features, sometimes bearing comparison to those of the Scandinavian deity Odin. One of his greatest feats is acting as a type of male midwife to the hero Xamyc, who has been made the carrier of the embryo of his son Batraz by his dying wife the water-sprite Lady Isp, who spits it between his shoulder blades, where it forms a womb-like cyst. Kurdalaegon prepares a type of tower or scaffold above a quenching bath for Xamyc, and, when the time is right, lances the cyst to liberate the infant hero Batraz as a newborn babe of white-hot steel, whom Kurdalægon then quenches like a newly forged sword.

The Anglo-Saxon Wayland Smith, known in Old Norse as Völundr, is a heroic blacksmith in Germanic mythology. The Poetic Edda states that he forged beautiful gold rings set with wonderful gems. He was captured by king Níðuðr, who cruelly hamstrung him and imprisoned him on an island. Völundr eventually had his revenge by killing Níðuðr&#x27;s sons and fashioning goblets from their skulls, jewels from their eyes and a brooch from their teeth. He then raped the king&#x27;s daughter, after drugging her with strong beer, and escaped, laughing, on wings of his own making, boasting that he had fathered a child upon her.
Seppo Ilmarinen, the Eternal Hammerer, blacksmith and inventor in the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, is an archetypal artificer from Finnish mythology.

Tubal-Cain is mentioned in the book of Genesis of the Torah as the original smith.

Ogun, the god of blacksmiths, warriors, hunters and others who work with iron is one of the pantheon of Orisha traditionally worshipped by the Yoruba people of Nigeria.

=== Before the Iron Age ===
Gold, silver, and copper all occur in nature in their native states, as reasonably pure metals humans probably worked these metals first. These metals are all quite malleable, and humans&#x27; initial development of hammering techniques was undoubtedly applied to these metals.

During the Chalcolithic era and the Bronze Age, humans in the Mideast learned how to smelt, melt, cast, rivet, and (to a limited extent) forge copper and bronze. Bronze is an alloy of copper and approximately 10% to 20% Tin. Bronze is superior to just copper, by being harder, being more resistant to corrosion, and by having a lower melting point (thereby requiring less fuel to melt and cast). Much of the copper used by the Mediterranean World came from the island of Cyprus. Most of the tin came from the Cornwall region of the island of Great Britain, transported by sea-borne Phoenician and Greek traders.

Copper and bronze cannot be hardened by heat-treatment, they can only be hardened by cold working. To accomplish this, a piece of bronze is lightly hammered for a long period of time. The localized stress-cycling causes work hardening by changing the size and shape of the metal&#x27;s crystals. The hardened bronze can then be ground to sharpen it to make edged tools.

Clocksmiths as recently as the 19th century used work hardening techniques to harden the teeth of brass gears and ratchets. Tapping on just the teeth produced harder teeth, with superior wear-resistance. By contrast, the rest of the gear was left in a softer and tougher state, more capable of resisting cracking.

Bronze is sufficiently corrosion-resistant that artifacts of bronze may last thousands of years relatively unscathed. Accordingly, museums frequently preserve more examples of Bronze Age metal-work than examples of artifacts from the much younger Iron Age. Buried iron artifacts may completely rust away in less than 100 years. Examples of ancient iron work still extant are very much the exception to the norm.

=== Iron Age ===
Concurrent with the advent of alphabetic characters in the Iron Age, humans became aware of the metal iron. However, in earlier ages, iron&#x27;s qualities, in contrast to those of bronze, were not generally understood. Iron artifacts, composed of meteoric iron, have the chemical composition containing up to 40% nickel. As this source of this iron is extremely rare and fortuitous, little development of smithing skills peculiar to iron can be assumed to have occurred. That we still possess any such artifacts of meteoric iron may be ascribed to the vagaries of climate, and the increased corrosion-resistance conferred on iron by the presence of nickel.

During the (north) Polar Exploration of the early 20th century, Inughuit, northern Greenlandic Inuit, were found to be making iron knives from two particularly large nickel-iron meteors. One of these meteors was taken to Washington, D.C., where it was remitted to the custody of the Smithsonian Institution.

The Hittites of Anatolia first discovered or developed the smelting of iron ores around 1500 BC. They seem to have maintained a near monopoly on the knowledge of iron production for several hundred years, but when their empire collapsed during the Eastern Mediterranean upheavals around 1200 BC, the knowledge seems to have escaped in all directions.

In the Iliad of Homer (describing the Trojan War and Bronze Age Greek and Trojan warriors), most of the armor and weapons (swords and spears) are stated to have been of bronze. Iron is not unknown, however, as arrowheads are described as iron, and a &quot;ball of iron&quot; is listed as a prize awarded for winning a competition.
The events described probably occurred around 1200 BC, but Homer is thought to have composed this epic poem around 700 BC; so exactitude must remain suspect.

The historical record during the Late Bronze Age Collapse is very inconsistent. Very few iron artifacts remain from the early Iron Age, due to loss from corrosion and re-use of iron as a valuable commodity. However, all of the basic operations of blacksmithing were in use by the time the Iron Age reached a particular locality. The scarcity of records and artifacts, and the rapidity of the transition from Bronze Age to Iron Age, is a reason to use evidence of bronze smithing to infer about the early development of blacksmithing.

It is uncertain when Iron weapons replaced Bronze weapons because the earliest Iron swords did not significantly improve on the qualities of existing bronze artifacts. Unalloyed iron is soft, does not hold an edge as well as a properly constructed bronze blade and needs more maintenance. Iron ores are more widely available than the necessary materials to create bronze however, which made iron weapons more economical than comparable bronze weapons. Small amounts of steel are often formed during several of the earliest refining practices, and when the properties of this alloy were discovered and exploited, steel edged weapons greatly outclassed bronze.

Iron is different from most other materials (including bronze), in that it does not immediately go from a solid to a liquid at its melting point. H2O is a solid (ice) at −1 C (31 F), and a liquid (water) at +1 C (33 F). Iron, by contrast, is definitely a solid at , but over the next it becomes increasingly plastic and more &quot;taffy-like&quot; as its temperature increases. This extreme temperature range of variable solidity is the fundamental material property upon which blacksmithing practice depends.

Another major difference between bronze and iron fabrication techniques is that bronze &quot;can&quot; be melted. The melting point of iron is much higher than that of bronze. In the western (Europe &amp; the Mideast) tradition, the technology to make fires hot enough to melt iron did not arise until the 16th century, when smelting operations grew large enough to require overly large bellows. These produced blast-furnace temperatures high enough to melt partially refined ores, resulting in &quot;cast iron&quot;. Thus cast-iron frying pans and cookware did not become possible in Europe until 3000 years after the introduction of iron smelting. China, in a separate developmental tradition, was producing cast iron at least 1000 years before this.

Although iron is quite abundant, good quality steel remained rare and expensive until the industrial developments of Bessemer process &quot;et al.&quot; in the 1850s. Close examination of blacksmith-made antique tools clearly shows where small pieces of steel were forge-welded into iron to provide the hardened steel cutting edges of tools (notably in axes, adzes, chisels, etc.). The re-use of quality steel is another reason for the lack of artifacts.

The Romans (who ensured that their own weapons were made with good steel) noted (in the 4th century BC) that the Celts of the Po River Valley had iron, but not good steel. The Romans record that during battle, their Celtic opponents could only swing their swords two or three times before having to step on their swords to straighten them.

On the Indian subcontinent, Wootz steel was, and continues to be, produced in small quantities.

In southern Asia and western Africa, blacksmiths form endogenous castes that sometimes speak distinct languages.

=== Medieval period ===
In the medieval period, blacksmithing was considered part of the set of &quot;seven mechanical arts&quot;.

Prior to the Industrial Revolution, a &quot;village smithy&quot; was a staple of every town. Factories and mass-production reduced the demand for blacksmith-made tools and hardware.

Blacksmiths typically worked in small shops, often in the center of a village or town. Their shops were typically equipped with a forge, an anvil, and a variety of other tools. The work of a medieval blacksmith was physically demanding and often dangerous. Blacksmiths had to be able to lift and move heavy pieces of metal, and they had to be careful not to burn themselves on the hot forge.

Despite the challenges, blacksmithing was a respected trade in medieval society. Blacksmiths were considered to be skilled artisans, and their work was essential to the functioning of medieval society.

==== Women ====
Whilst the majority of blacksmiths named in Britain in the medieval period were men, some women also worked as smiths. For example, in 1346 Katherine Le Fevre was appointed by Edward III to ‘keep up the king’s forge within the Tower and carry on [its] work … receiving the wages pertaining to the office’. Another example is of Alice la Haubergere (Mail-maker) who owned an armour shop and worked as an armourer in Cheapside. In York in 1403 Agnes Hecche was left her father&#x27;s mail-making equipment in his will, and took over the family business with her brother. Others included the bell founder Johanna Hill, the cutler Agnes Cotiller and Eustachia l’Armurer.

==== Medieval blacksmithing techniques ====
Medieval blacksmiths used a variety of techniques to create metal objects. One of the most common techniques was forging. Forging is the process of heating metal until it is soft enough to be shaped with a hammer and anvil.

Another common technique was welding. Welding is the process of joining two pieces of metal together by heating them until they melt and then hammering them together.

Blacksmiths also used a variety of other techniques, such as casting, cutting, and filing.

The original fuel for forge fires was charcoal. Coal did not begin to replace charcoal until the forests of first Britain (during the AD 17th century), and then the eastern United States of America (during the 19th century) were largely depleted. Coal &quot;can be&quot; an inferior fuel for blacksmithing, because much of the world&#x27;s coal is contaminated with sulfur. Sulfur contamination of iron and steel make them &quot;red short&quot;, so that at red heat they become &quot;crumbly&quot; instead of &quot;plastic&quot;. Coal sold and purchased for blacksmithing should be largely free of sulfur.

European blacksmiths before and through the medieval era spent a great deal of time heating and hammering iron before forging it into finished articles. Although they were unaware of the chemical basis, they were aware that the quality of the iron was thus improved. From a scientific point of view, the reducing atmosphere of the forge was both removing oxygen (rust), and soaking more carbon into the iron, thereby developing increasingly higher grades of steel as the process was continued.

=== Industrial era ===
During the eighteenth century, agents for the Sheffield cutlery industry scoured the British country-side, offering new carriage springs for old. Springs must be made of hardened steel. At this time, the processes for making steel produced an extremely variable product—quality was not ensured at the initial point of sale. Springs that had survived cracking through hard use over the rough roads of the time, had proven to be of a better quality steel. Much of the fame of Sheffield cutlery (knives, shears, etc.) was due to the extreme lengths the companies took to ensure they used high-grade steel.

 During the first half of the nineteenth century, the US government included in their treaties with many Native American tribes, that the US would employ blacksmiths and at Army forts, with the expressed purpose of providing Native Americans with iron tools and repair services.

During the early to mid-nineteenth century, both European armies as well as both the U.S. Federal and Confederate armies employed blacksmiths to shoe horses and repair equipment such as wagons, horse tack, and artillery equipment. These smiths primarily worked at a traveling forge that when combined with a limber, comprised wagons specifically designed and constructed as blacksmith shops on wheels to carry the essential equipment necessary for their work.

Lathes, patterned largely on their woodturning counterparts, had been used by some blacksmiths since the middle-ages. During the 1790s Henry Maudslay created the first screw-cutting lathe, a watershed event that signaled the start of blacksmiths being replaced by machinists in factories for the hardware needs of the populace.

Samuel Colt neither invented nor perfected interchangeable parts, but his insistence (and other industrialists at this time) that his firearms be manufactured with this property, was another step towards the obsolescence of metal-working artisans and blacksmiths. (See also Eli Whitney).

As demand for their products declined, many more blacksmiths augmented their incomes by taking in work shoeing horses. A shoer-of-horses was historically known as a farrier in English. With the introduction of automobiles, the number of blacksmiths continued to decrease, many former blacksmiths becoming the initial generation of automobile Mechanics. The nadir of blacksmithing in the United States was reached during the 1960s, when most of the former blacksmiths had left the trade, and few if any new people were entering the trade. By this time, most of the working blacksmiths were those performing farrier work, so the term &quot;blacksmith&quot; was effectively co-opted by the farrier trade.

==== Neoclassicism era ====

In the final part of the 18th century, forged ironwork continued to decline due to the aforementioned industrial revolution, shapes of the elements in the designs of window grilles and other decorative functional items continued to contradict natural forms, surfaces begin to be covered in paint, cast iron elements are incorporated into the forged designs.

Main features of Neoclassicism ironwork (also referred to as Louis XVI style and Empire style ironwork) include smooth straight bars, decorative geometric elements, double or oval volutes and the usage of elements from Classical antiquity (Meander (art), wreaths etc.).

Typical for this kind of ironwork is that the ironwork is painted white with gold (gilded) elements.

== 20th and 21st centuries ==
During the 20th century various gases (natural gas, acetylene, etc.) have also come to be used as fuels for blacksmithing. While these are fine for blacksmithing iron, special care must be taken when using them to blacksmith steel. Each time a piece of steel is heated, there is a tendency for the carbon content to leave the steel (decarburization). This can leave a piece of steel with an effective layer of unhardenable iron on its surface. In a traditional charcoal or coal forge, the fuel is really just carbon. In a properly regulated charcoal/coal fire, the air in and immediately around the fire should be a reducing atmosphere. In this case, and at elevated temperatures, there is a tendency for vaporized carbon to soak &quot;into&quot; steel and iron, counteracting or negating the decarburizing tendency. This is similar to the process by which a case of steel is developed on a piece of iron in preparation for case hardening.

A renewed interest in blacksmithing occurred as part of the trend in &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; and &quot;self-sufficiency&quot; that occurred during the 1970s. Currently there are many books, organizations and individuals working to help educate the public about blacksmithing, including local groups of smiths who have formed clubs, with some of those smiths demonstrating at historical sites and living history events. Some modern blacksmiths who produce decorative metalwork refer to themselves as artist-blacksmiths. In 1973 the Artists Blacksmiths’ Association of North America was formed with 27 members. By 2013 it had almost 4000 members. Likewise the British Artist Blacksmiths Association was created in 1978, with 30 charter members and had about 600 members in 2013 and publish for members a quarterly magazine.

While developed nations saw a decline and re-awakening of interest in blacksmithing, in many developing nations blacksmiths continued making and repairing iron and steel tools and hardware for people in their local area.

<doc id="145094" wikidata="Q548264" url="?curid=145094" title="XML Metadata Interchange">
<text>The XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) is an Object Management Group (OMG) standard for exchanging metadata information via Extensible Markup Language (XML).

It can be used for any metadata whose metamodel can be expressed in Meta-Object Facility (MOF), a platform-independent model (PIM).

The most common use of XMI is as an interchange format for UML models, although it can also be used for serialization of models of other languages (metamodels).

== Overview ==
In the OMG vision of modeling, data is split into abstract models and concrete models. The abstract models represent the semantic information, whereas the concrete models represent visual diagrams. Abstract models are instances of arbitrary MOF-based modeling languages such as UML or SysML. For diagrams, the Diagram Interchange (DI, XMI[DI]) standard is used. There are currently several incompatibilities between different modeling tool vendor implementations of XMI, even between interchange of abstract model data. The usage of Diagram Interchange is almost nonexistent. This means exchanging files between UML modeling tools using XMI is rarely possible.

One purpose of XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) is to enable easy interchange of metadata between UML-based modeling tools and MOF-based metadata repositories in distributed heterogeneous environments. XMI is also commonly used as the medium by which models are passed from modeling tools to software generation tools as part of model-driven engineering.

Examples of XMI, and lists of the XML tags that make up XMI-formatted files, are available in the version 2.5.1 specification document.

== Integration of industry standards ==
XMI integrates 4 industry standards:
* XML – Extensible Markup Language, a W3C standard.
* UML – Unified Modeling Language, an OMG modeling standard.
* MOF – Meta Object Facility, an OMG language for specifying metamodels.
* MOF – Mapping to XMI

The integration of these 4 standards into XMI allows tool developers of distributed systems to share object models and other metadata.

Several versions of XMI have been created: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 2.0, 2.1, 2.1.1, 2.4, 2.4.1, 2.4.2. and 2 5.1. The 2.x versions are radically different from the 1.x series.
The Diagram Definition OMG project is another alternative for metadata interchange, which can also express the layout and graphical representation.

XMI is an international standard:
;XMI 2.4.2
:ISO/IEC 19509:2014 Information technology — XML Metadata Interchange (XMI)
;XMI 2.0
:ISO/IEC 19503:2005 Information technology — XML Metadata Interchange (XMI)

<text>A motor vehicle, also known as a motorized vehicle, automotive vehicle, [[automobile]], or road vehicle, is a self-propelled land vehicle, commonly wheeled, that does not operate on rails (such as trains or trams), does not fly (such as airplanes or helicopters), does not float on water (such as boats or ships), and is used for the transportation of people or cargo.

The vehicle propulsion is provided by an engine or motor, usually a gasoline/diesel internal combustion engine or an electric traction motor, or some combination of the two as in hybrid electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles. For legal purpose, motor vehicles are often identified within a number of vehicle classes including cars, buses, motorcycles, off-road vehicles, light trucks and regular trucks. These classifications vary according to the legal codes of each country. ISO 3833:1977 is the standard for road vehicle types, terms and definitions. Generally, to avoid requiring people with disabilities from having to possess an operator&#x27;s license to use one, or requiring tags and insurance, powered wheelchairs will be specifically excluded by law from being considered motor vehicles.

, there were more than one billion motor vehicles in use in the world, excluding off-road vehicles and heavy construction equipment. The US publisher Ward&#x27;s estimates that as of 2019, there were 1.4 billion motor vehicles in use in the world.

Global vehicle ownership per capita in 2010 was 148 vehicles in operation (VIO) per 1000 people. China has the largest motor vehicle fleet in the world, with 322 million motor vehicles registered at the end of September 2018. The United States has the highest vehicle ownership per capita in the world, with 832 vehicles in operation per 1000 people in 2016. Also, China became the world&#x27;s largest new car market in 2009. In 2022, a total of 85 million cars and commercial vehicles were built, led by China which built a total of 27 million motor vehicles.

==Definitions and terminology==

In 1968 the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic gave one of the first international definitions of a motor vehicle:
Other sources might provide other definitions, for instance in the year 1977, ISO 3833:1977 provide other definitions.

==Ownership trends==


The U.S. publisher Ward&#x27;s estimates that as of 2010, there were 1.015 billion motor vehicles in use in the world. This figure represents the number of cars, trucks (light, medium and heavy duty), and buses, but does not include off-road vehicles or heavy construction equipment. The world vehicle population passed the 500 million-unit mark in 1986, from 250 million motor vehicles in 1970. Between 1950 and 1970, the vehicle population doubled roughly every 10 years. Navigant Consulting forecasts that the global stock of light-duty motor vehicles will reach 2 billion units in 2035.

Global vehicle ownership in 2010 was 148 vehicles in operation per 1,000 people, a ratio of 1:6.75 vehicles to people, slightly down from 150 vehicles per 1,000 people in 2009, a rate of 1:6.63 vehicles to people. The global rate of motorization increased in 2013 to 174 vehicles per 1000 people. In developing countries vehicle ownership rates rarely exceed 200 cars per 1,000 population.

The following table summarizes the evolution of motor vehicle registrations in the world from 1960 to 2019:

;Alternative fuels and vehicle technology adoption


Since the early 2000s, the number of alternative fuel vehicles has been increasing driven by the interest of several governments to promote their widespread adoption through public subsidies and other non-financial incentives. Governments have adopted these policies due to a combination of factors, such as environmental concerns, high oil prices, and less dependence on imported oil.

Among the fuels other than traditional petroleum fuels (gasoline or diesel fuel), and alternative technologies for powering the engine of a motor vehicle, the most popular options promoted by different governments are: natural gas vehicles, LPG powered vehicles, flex-fuel vehicles, use of biofuels, hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids, electric cars, and hydrogen fuel cell cars.

Since the late 2000s, China, European countries, the United States, Canada, Japan and other developed countries have been providing strong financial incentives to promote the adoption of plug-in electric vehicle. , the stock of light-duty plug-in vehicles in use totaled over 10 million units. , in addition, the medium and heavy commercial segments add another 700,000 units to the global stock of plug-in electric vehicles. In 2020 the global market share of plug-in passenger car sales was 4.2%, up from 2.5% in 2019. Nevertheless, despite government support and the rapid growth experienced, the plug-in electric car segment represented just about 1 out of every 250 vehicles (0.4%) on the world&#x27;s roads by the end of 2018.
===China===
The People&#x27;s Republic of China had 322 million motor vehicles in use at the end of September 2018, of which, 235 million were passenger cars in 2018, making China the country with largest motor vehicle fleet in the world. In 2016, the motor vehicle fleet consisted of 165.6 million cars and 28.4 million trucks and buses. About 13.6 million vehicles were sold in 2009, and motor vehicle registrations in 2010 increased to more than 16.8 million units, representing nearly half the world&#x27;s fleet increase in 2010. Ownership per capita rose from 26.6 vehicles per 1000 people in 2006 to 141.2 in 2016.

The stock of highway-legal plug-in electric or new energy vehicles in China totaled 2.21 million units by the end of September 2018, of which, 81% are all-electric vehicles. These figures include heavy-duty commercial vehicles such buses and sanitation trucks, which represent about 11% of the total stock. China is also the world&#x27;s largest electric bus market, reaching about 385,000 units by the end of 2017.

The number of cars and motorcycles in China increased 20 times between 2000 and 2010. This explosive growth has allowed China to become the world&#x27;s largest new car market, overtaking the US in 2009. Nevertheless, ownership per capita is 58 vehicles per 1000 people, or a ratio of 1:17.2 vehicles to people, still well below the rate of motorization of developed countries.

===United States===
The United States has the second-largest fleet of motor vehicles in the world after China. , had a motor vehicles stock of 259.14 million, of which, 246 million were light duty vehicles, consisting of 112.96 million passenger cars and 133 million light trucks (includes SUVs). A total of 11.5 million heavy trucks were registered at the end 2016 Vehicle ownership per capita in the U.S. is also the highest in the world, the U.S. Department of Energy (USDoE) reports a motorization rate of 831.9 vehicles in operation per 1000 people in 2016, or a ratio of 1:1.2 vehicles to people.

According to USDoE, the rate of motorization peaked in 2007 at 844.5 vehicles per 1,000 people. In terms of licensed drivers, as of 2009 the country had 1.0 vehicle for every licensed driver, and 1.87 vehicles per household. Passenger car registrations in the United States declined -11.5% in 2017 and -12.8% in 2018.

, the stock of alternative fuel vehicles in the United States included over 20 million flex-fuel cars and light trucks, the world&#x27;s second-largest flexible-fuel fleet in the world after Brazil. However, actual use of ethanol fuel is significantly limited due to the lack of E85 refueling infrastructure.

Regarding the electrified segment, the fleet of hybrid electric vehicles in the United States is the second largest in the world after Japan, with more than four million units sold through April 2016. Since the introduction of the Tesla Roadster electric car in 2008, cumulative sales of highway legal plug-in electric vehicles in the United States passed one million units in September 2018. The U.S. stock of plug-in vehicles is the second largest after China (2.21 million by September 2018).

, the country&#x27;s fleet also includes more than 160,000 natural gas vehicles, mainly transit buses and delivery fleets. Despite its relative small size, natural gas use accounted for about 52% of all alternative fuels consumed by alternative transportation fuel vehicles in the U.S. in 2009.

===Europe===
The 27 European Union (EU-27) member countries had a fleet of over 256 million in 2008, and passenger cars accounted for 87% of the union&#x27;s fleet.

The EU-27 member countries had in 2009 an estimated ownership rate of 473 passenger cars per 1000 people.

According to Ward&#x27;s, Italy had the second highest (after the U.S.) vehicle ownership per capita in 2010, with 690 vehicles per 1000 people. Germany had a rate of motorization of 534 vehicles per 1000 people and the UK of 525 vehicles per 1000 people, both in 2008. France had a rate of 575 vehicles per 1000 people and Spain 608 vehicles per 1000 people in 2007. Portugal, between 1991 and 2002 grew up 220% on its motorization rate, having had in 2002, 560 cars per 1000 people.

Italy also leads in alternative fuel vehicles, with a fleet of 779,090 natural gas vehicles , the largest NGV fleet in Europe. Sweden, with 225,000 flexible-fuel vehicles, has the largest flexifuel fleet in Europe by mid-2011.

<text>The Twelve Apostles are a collection of limestone stacks off the shore of Port Campbell National Park, by the Great Ocean Road in Victoria, Australia.
Their proximity to one another has made the site a popular tourist attraction. Despite their name, it is possible that there were never 12 rock stacks. Seven of the original nine stacks remain standing. Six of them are visible from the most popular viewpoint, while the seventh is located several metres away from the corner of the main viewing platform.

==Formation and history==

The limestone unit that forms The Twelve Apostles is referred to as the Port Campbell Limestone, which was deposited in the Mid-Late Miocene, around 15 to 5 million years ago.

The Twelve Apostles were formed by erosion. The harsh and extreme weather conditions from the Southern Ocean gradually erode the soft limestone to form caves in the cliffs, which then become arches that eventually collapse, leaving rock stacks up to high. The stacks are susceptible to further erosion from waves. In July 2005, a stack collapsed, leaving eight standing. Another collapsed in 2009 leaving seven remaining stacks. Due to wave action eroding the cliffs, existing headlands are expected to become new limestone stacks in the future.

The stacks were originally known as the Pinnacles, and the Sow and Pigs (or Sow and Piglets, with Muttonbird Island being the Sow and the smaller rock stacks being the Piglets), as well as the Twelve Apostles. The formation&#x27;s name was made official as the Twelve Apostles, after the Apostles of Jesus, to attract more tourists, despite only ever having had nine stacks.

In 2002, the Port Campbell Professional Fishermen&#x27;s Association attempted to block the creation of the Twelve Apostles Marine National Park at the Twelve Apostles site. The association approved of a later decision by the Victorian government to prohibit seismic exploration at the site by Benaris Energy, believing such exploration would harm marine life.

In March 2023, the Federal Court of Australia ruled in favour (under the Native Title Act of 1993) of formally recognising the Eastern Maar people as traditional owners&#x27; of 8,578 km2 of land located in south-west Victoria, including the Twelve Apostles.

<text>Salinas (, ) is a town and municipality in the southern part of Puerto Rico located in the southern coast of the island, south of Aibonito and Cayey; southeast of Coamo, east of Santa Isabel; and west of Guayama. Salinas is spread over 5 barrios and Salinas Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city).

It has long been a fishing spot for Puerto Ricans, known for its beaches, fish variety and the birthplace of the famous &quot;mojo isleño&quot;.

Although Salinas doesn&#x27;t have any commercial airports, there is a military training area there, Camp Santiago, which is one of the training centers of the Puerto Rico National Guard.

<doc id="145114" wikidata="Q979639" url="?curid=145114" title="Emanuel Steward">
<text>Emanuel &quot;Manny&quot; Steward (July 7, 1944 – October 25, 2012) was an American boxer, trainer, and commentator for HBO Boxing. Known as &quot;the godfather of Detroit boxing,&quot; Steward trained 41 world champion fighters throughout his career, most notably Thomas Hearns, through the famous Kronk Gym and later heavyweights Lennox Lewis and Wladimir Klitschko. Emanuel trained over two dozen boxers who turned out to be champions in the course of his career. His heavyweight fighters had a combined record of 34–2–1 in title fights. He was an inductee of the International Boxing Hall Of Fame, and the World Boxing Hall of Fame. Steward was also known for his charity work in Detroit, Michigan, helping youth to attain an education.

==Life and career==
Steward was born in Bottom Creek, West Virginia, but, by the age of 12, he had moved with his mother to Detroit, Michigan, after she divorced his father, who was a coal miner. After moving to Detroit, he worked briefly in the auto industry before eventually going to Brewster Recreation Center, where Joe Louis and Eddie Futch trained. Steward began an amateur boxing career there. He compiled a record of 94 wins and 3 losses as an amateur boxer, including winning the 1963 national Golden Gloves tournament in the bantamweight division.

In 1971, Steward took his half brother, James Steward, to the nearby Kronk Gym, a hot-bed for amateur boxers in the 1970s, and became a part-time coach there. Steward trained many of the nation&#x27;s top amateurs. He eventually translated his success with amateurs into a career training championship-level professional fighters.

On March 2, 1980, Hilmer Kenty became Steward&#x27;s first world champion by knocking out world lightweight champ Ernesto España. Steward achieved his most notable early success with welterweight Thomas Hearns, whom he changed from a light hitting boxer into one of the most devastating punchers in boxing history. Hearns became one of Steward&#x27;s most successful and popular fighters, fighting Sugar Ray Leonard, knocking out Roberto Durán, and challenging undisputed middleweight champion Marvelous Marvin Hagler. 
He was well known for his outgoing personality and endless energy. In addition, he was very giving and was known for being a father figure. He even, at one point, obtained a 97–3 title. Even though he fought, his main passion was training.

===Death===
Steward died on October 25, 2012, after undergoing surgery for diverticulitis. He was 68. Colon cancer was subsequently reported as a contributing factor to his death.

==Honors==
*Elected into the International Boxing Hall of Fame
*Elected into the World Boxing Hall of Fame

==Kronk Gym==

Kronk Gym became a property of Steward&#x27;s, who was also famous for his collection of Rolls-Royce cars and mansions. He opened a branch of the gym in Tucson, Arizona, and started an association with the Dodge Theater in Phoenix to present boxing undercards once a month.

Steward often turned up the thermostat to make boxers so uncomfortable that some would claim that even the walls would sweat.

<text>The Melba Gully State Park was formed to protect a small pocket of natural temperate rainforest in the Otway Ranges near Apollo Bay, Victoria, Australia. The park is extremely valuable as one of the few pockets of natural old-growth Otway Ranges rainforests to survive the logging and subsequent fires, making it a key part of the regeneration of the original Otway Ranges rainforests. The park now forms part of the Great Otway National Park.

The gully has a dense cover of myrtle beech (&quot;Nothofagus cunninghamii&quot;), blackwood (&quot;Acacia melanoxylon&quot;) and tree-ferns, with an understorey of low ferns and mosses. Glow worms (&quot;Arachnocampa otwayensis&quot;), which are the bioluminescent larvae of small flies known as fungus gnats, can be seen at night along the stream banks and walking tracks.

The park has few facilities due to its small size, but it has a picnic ground and basic picnic facilities, with the main attraction being the 35 minute Madsens Track Nature Walk.

<doc id="145116" wikidata="Q265670" url="?curid=145116" title="Turov, Belarus">
<text>Turov or Turaw (; ; ; ; ; ) is a town in Zhytkavichy District, Gomel Region, Belarus. As of 2024, it has a population of 2,752.

It served as the capital of the Principality of Turov during the Middle Ages.

==History==
Turov was an ancient capital of the Dregovich tribe - one of the three Eastern Slavic tribes that are considered ancestors of the modern Belarusian people (the others being Krivichs and Drevlians). Turov was first mentioned in the &quot;Tale of Bygone Years&quot; from 980. It is located in the southern part of Belarus, in the historical region of Polesia.

According to legend, the city was founded at the crossing of Yazda and Strumen rivers by Duke Tur - hence the name Turov. Other etymology draws the name from &quot;Tur&quot;, the Slavic name of the Aurochs. Both rivers join with the Pripyat river, which in turn flows into the Dnieper and then leads to the Black Sea. This river route was known to Vikings, who used it extensively for communication and during their frequent raids to Constantinople.

The Varangian dynasty of Ruriks became dukes in the neighboring Duchy of Kiev. Soon Turov also came under the dominion of a local branch of dukes of the Rurik Dynasty and particularly of Izyaslav I, son of Yaroslav the Wise. In that period the town of Turaŭ was not only an important trade center within the Kievan Rus&#x27;, due to its proximity to major trade routes running from the Baltic Sea to the Byzantine Empire, but also one of the most important cities of the Rus among Kiev, Chernihiv, Novgorod, and Pereyaslav. The Prince of Turov, the main contender to the throne of the Kievan Rus&#x27; before their subjugation to the Monomakhs considerably influenced the early politics of the neighboring Duchy of Poland in the 11th century having together an intertwined history.

Thanks to the towns&#x27; strategic location, many different crafts were developed and practiced in Turov. It was also home to bishops Cyril of Turov and Laverentiy of Turov. In 1005 the first Roman Christian bishopric on the territory of Belarus was founded in Turov. The town&#x27;s period of prosperity ended with a number of feudal conflicts in the 12th century. Soon afterwards Turaŭ lost much of its importance as well as its autonomy.

In 1320 Turov became a part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania having closely assimilated with the Prince of Minsk. In 1430 it became a private town of the Grand Duke Svitrigaila. In the end of the 15th century Turaŭ became a property of Grand Court Marshal of Lithuania Michal Glinski. In 1502 it was damaged by a Tatar invasion. After Glinski&#x27;s betrayal and escape to Grand Duchy of Moscow in 1508, Turov was confiscated by the family of Konstanty Ostrogski, who started the reconstruction, but the town was yet again destroyed by the Tatars in 1521. The Ostrogski family owned the town for more than a century, until it was given as a dowry to the Sapieha and then Potocki magnate families. During The Deluge the town was taken by Muscovy, but was soon retaken by Janusz Radziwiłł. After the period of constant wars with Muscovy, the town was severely damaged. By 1667, Turov had only 111 households left of the 401 there in 1648.

The town never fully recovered. After the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 it was annexed by Russia and remained a small, provincial town for most of the 19th century. From that time onwards it shared the fate of the nearby town of Gomel.

in 1810, the wooden Orthodox Church of All Saints was built in Turov. It has survived down to this day, never having been rebuilt. Inside the church are kept the weeping icon of St Nicholas, and two old Christian crosses covered in legends and stories. The church remains as a centre of Orthodox life in the town.

===Jewish population===
The shtetl (Jewish community) in Turov began in the 16th century. The population of Jewish people reached its peak at the end of the 19th century. After that time they began to emigrate to larger cities and to other countries. Turov was subjected to pogroms (violence against Jewish communities), but the Jewish population managed to hang on through World War I and the Russian Revolution. Even after the Bolsheviks took over, the Jewish population continued to carry on their traditions and there was a degree of tolerance among the non-Jewish population of Turov. Greater efforts to suppress religious activity began in the 1930s.

In 1921 two schools opened in Turov, both a general school and a Yiddish school; both were attended by Jewish students. There were three synagogues in Turov, one Misnagdim and two Hasidic. All three closed in the early 1930s.

The Jewish population in Turov was wiped out during World War II. Some Jews volunteered to join the army to fight the Germans. The first German army units to come through Turov, in July 1941, did nothing to the Jewish population. The Holocaust began with the arrival of later units. Very few families returned after the war and as of 2003 there were only three Jewish people living in Turov.

==Town flag==
The Turov Flag was accepted by town&#x27;s council on September 27, 2001 and was included in Belarus&#x27; coats of arms registry on January 23, 2002.

Additionally, it has a rectangular form with width to length ratio equal 1 : 2, and consists of three horizontal bands: blue (6/9 of width), white (1/9 of width) and red (2/9 of width).

<doc id="145126" wikidata="Q44382" url="?curid=145126" title="Principal ideal">
<text>In mathematics, specifically ring theory, a principal ideal is an ideal formula_1 in a ring formula_2 that is generated by a single element formula_3 of formula_2 through multiplication by every element of formula_5 The term also has another, similar meaning in order theory, where it refers to an (order) ideal in a poset formula_6 generated by a single element formula_7 which is to say the set of all elements less than or equal to formula_8 in formula_9

The remainder of this article addresses the ring-theoretic concept.

==Definitions==
* A &quot;left principal ideal&quot; of formula_2 is a subset of formula_2 given by formula_12 for some element formula_13
* A &quot;right principal ideal&quot; of formula_2 is a subset of formula_2 given by formula_16 for some element formula_13
* A &quot;two-sided principal ideal&quot; of formula_2 is a subset of formula_2 given by formula_20 for some element formula_21 namely, the set of all finite sums of elements of the form formula_22

While the definition for two-sided principal ideal may seem more complicated than for the one-sided principal ideals, it is necessary to ensure that the ideal remains closed under addition.

If formula_2 is a commutative ring, then the above three notions are all the same. In that case, it is common to write the ideal generated by formula_3 as formula_25 or formula_26

==Examples and non-examples==
* The principal ideals in the (commutative) ring formula_27 are formula_28 In fact, every ideal of formula_27 is principal (see ).
* In any ring formula_2, the sets formula_31 and formula_32 are principal ideals.
* For any ring formula_2 and element formula_21 the ideals formula_35 and formula_36 are respectively left, right, and two-sided principal ideals, by definition. For example, formula_37 is a principal ideal of formula_38
* In the commutative ring formula_39 of complex polynomials in two variables, the set of polynomials that vanish everywhere on the set of points formula_40 is a principal ideal because it can be written as formula_41 (the set of polynomials divisible by formula_8).
* In the same ring formula_39, the ideal formula_44 generated by both formula_8 and formula_46 is &quot;not&quot; principal. (The ideal formula_44 is the set of all polynomials with zero for the constant term.) To see this, suppose there was a generator formula_48 for formula_49 so formula_50 Then formula_51 contains both formula_8 and formula_53 so formula_48 must divide both formula_8 and formula_56 Then formula_48 must be a nonzero constant polynomial. This is a contradiction since formula_58 but the only constant polynomial in formula_59 is the zero polynomial.
* In the ring formula_60 the numbers where formula_61 is even form a non-principal ideal. This ideal forms a regular hexagonal lattice in the complex plane. Consider formula_62 and formula_63 These numbers are elements of this ideal with the same norm (two), but because the only units in the ring are formula_64 and formula_65 they are not associates.

==Related definitions==
A ring in which every ideal is principal is called &quot;principal&quot;, or a &quot;principal ideal ring&quot;. A &quot;principal ideal domain&quot; (PID) is an integral domain in which every ideal is principal. Any PID is a unique factorization domain; the normal proof of unique factorization in the integers (the so-called fundamental theorem of arithmetic) holds in any PID.

As an example, formula_27 is a principal ideal domain, which can be shown as follows. Suppose formula_67 where formula_68 and consider the surjective homomorphisms formula_69 Since formula_70 is finite, for sufficiently large formula_71 we have formula_72 Thus formula_73 which implies formula_1 is always finitely generated. Since the ideal formula_75 generated by any integers formula_3 and formula_77 is exactly formula_78 by induction on the number of generators it follows that formula_1 is principal.

==Properties==
Any Euclidean domain is a PID; the algorithm used to calculate greatest common divisors may be used to find a generator of any ideal.
More generally, any two principal ideals in a commutative ring have a greatest common divisor in the sense of ideal multiplication.
In principal ideal domains, this allows us to calculate greatest common divisors of elements of the ring, up to multiplication by a unit; we define formula_80 to be any generator of the ideal formula_81

For a Dedekind domain formula_82 we may also ask, given a non-principal ideal formula_1 of formula_82 whether there is some extension formula_85 of formula_2 such that the ideal of formula_85 generated by formula_1 is principal (said more loosely, formula_1 &quot;becomes principal&quot; in formula_85).
This question arose in connection with the study of rings of algebraic integers (which are examples of Dedekind domains) in number theory, and led to the development of class field theory by Teiji Takagi, Emil Artin, David Hilbert, and many others.

The principal ideal theorem of class field theory states that every integer ring formula_2 (i.e. the ring of integers of some number field) is contained in a larger integer ring formula_85 which has the property that &quot;every&quot; ideal of formula_2 becomes a principal ideal of formula_94 In this theorem we may take formula_85 to be the ring of integers of the Hilbert class field of formula_2; that is, the maximal unramified abelian extension (that is, Galois extension whose Galois group is abelian) of the fraction field of formula_82 and this is uniquely determined by formula_5

Krull&#x27;s principal ideal theorem states that if formula_2 is a Noetherian ring and formula_1 is a principal, proper ideal of formula_82 then formula_1 has height at most one.

<text>A narrowboat is a particular type of canal boat, built to fit the narrow locks of the United Kingdom. The UK&#x27;s canal system provided a nationwide transport network during the Industrial Revolution, but with the advent of the railways, commercial canal traffic gradually diminished and the last regular long-distance transportation of goods by canal had virtually disappeared by 1970. However, some commercial traffic continued. From the 1970s onward narrowboats were gradually being converted into permanent residences or as holiday lettings. Currently, about 8,580 narrowboats are registered as &#x27;permanent homes&#x27; on Britain&#x27;s waterway system and represent a growing alternative community living on semi-permanent moorings or continuously cruising.

For any boat to enter a narrow lock, it must be under wide, so most narrowboats are nominally wide. A narrowboat&#x27;s maximum length is generally , as anything longer will be unable to navigate much of the British canal network, because the nominal maximum length of locks is . Some locks are shorter than , so to access the entire canal network the maximum length is . Exterior height is usually 6 foot 10 inch (2.08 m). Possibly 2 foot to 2 foot 10 (0.6m-0.8m) below the waterline, so you generally have 4 to 4 foot 10 (1.21m-1.47m) above the water line. 

The first narrow boats played a key role in the economic changes of the British Industrial Revolution. They were wooden boats drawn by a horse walking on the canal towpath led by a crew member. Horses were gradually replaced by steam and then diesel engines. By the end of the 19th century it was common practice to paint roses and castles on narrowboats and their fixtures and fittings. This tradition has continued into the 21st century, but not all narrowboats have such decorations.

Modern narrowboats are used for holidays, weekend breaks, touring, or as permanent or part-time residences. Usually, they have steel hulls and a steel superstructure. The hull&#x27;s flat base is usually 10 mm thick, the hull sides 6 mm or 8 mm, the cabin sides 6 mm, and the roof 4 mm or 6 mm. The numbers of boats have been rising, with the number of licensed boats (not all of them narrowboats) on canals and rivers managed by the Canal &amp; River Trust (CRT) estimated at 27,000 in 2006; by 2019, this had risen to 34,367. Although a small number of steel narrowboats dispense with the need for a rear steering deck entirely, by imitating some river cruisers in providing wheel steering from a central cockpit, most narrowboats&#x27; steering is by a tiller on the stern. There are three major configurations for the stern: traditional stern, cruiser stern and semi-traditional stern.

==Terminology==
The narrowboat (one word) definition in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; is:
Earlier quotations listed use the term &quot;narrow boat&quot;, with the most recent, a quotation from an advertisement in &quot;Canal Boat &amp; Inland Waterways&quot; in 1998, using &quot;narrowboat&quot;.

The single word &quot;narrowboat&quot; has been adopted by authorities such as the Canal and River Trust, Scottish Canals and the authoritative magazine &quot;Waterways World&quot; to refer to all boats built in the style and tradition of commercial boats that were able to fit in the narrow canal locks.

Although some narrowboats are built to a design based on river barges and many conform to the strict definition of the term, it is incorrect to refer to a narrowboat as a &quot;widebeam&quot; or as a &quot;barge&quot;, both of which are definable by their greater width. In the context of British inland waterways, a barge is usually a much wider, cargo-carrying boat or a modern boat modelled on one, certainly more than wide.

Another historic term for a narrow boat is &quot;long boat&quot;, which has been noted in the Midlands and especially on the River Severn and connecting waterways to Birmingham.

Usage has not quite settled as regards (a) boats based on narrowboat design, but too wide for narrow canals; or (b) boats the same width as narrowboats but based on other types of boat.

Narrowboats may have ship prefix &quot;NB&quot;.

==Size==
The key distinguishing feature of a narrowboat is its width, which must be less than to navigate British narrow canals. Some old boats are very close to this limit (often built or slightly wider), and can have trouble using certain narrow locks whose width has been reduced over time because of subsidence. Modern boats are usually produced to a maximum of wide to guarantee easy passage throughout the complete system.

Because of their slenderness, some narrowboats seem very long. The maximum length is about , which matches the length of the longest locks on the system. Modern narrowboats tend to be shorter, to permit cruising anywhere on the connected network of British canalsincluding on canals built for wider, but shorter, boats.The shortest lock on the main network is Salterhebble Middle Lock on the Calder and Hebble Navigation, at about long. However, the C&amp;H is a wide canal, so the lock is about wide. This makes the largest narrowboat that can go anywhere on the network slightly longer (about ) than the straight length of the lock, because it can (with a certain amount of &quot;shoehorning&quot;) lie diagonally. Some locks on isolated waterways are as short as . Where it was possible to avoid going through locks, narrow boats were sometimes built a little larger. Wharf boats or more usually &#x27;Amptons, operated on the Wolverhampton level of the Birmingham Canal Navigations and were up to 89 feet in length and 7 foot 10.5 inches wide.

Hire fleets on British canals usually consist of narrow boats in varied lengths from upwards, to allow parties of different numbers or varying budgets to be able to hire a boat and get afloat.

== Developmenttraditional working boats ==
The first narrow boats played a key part in the economic changes of the British Industrial Revolution. They were wooden boats drawn by a horse walking on the canal towpath led by a crew member, often a child. Narrow boats were chiefly designed for carrying cargo, though some packet boats carried passengers, luggage, mail and parcels.

The first canals to feature locks in the now standard size were the canals designed by James Brindley and approved by Parliament in 1766, including the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal and Trent and Mersey Canal. Although construction took many years, the lock size became standard for many canal building projects.

Boatmen&#x27;s families originally lived ashore, but in the 1830s as canals started to suffer competition from the burgeoning railway system, families (especially those of independent single boat owner/skippers) began to live on board, partly because they could no longer afford rents, partly to provide extra hands to work the boats harder, faster and further, partly to keep families together. As late as 1858, a &quot;Household Words&quot; article states that &quot;the Grand Junction Canal company did not allow the boatmen&#x27;s families on board.&quot; The crew of the non-stopping (&quot;fly&quot;) boat in the article (skipper, two crew and a &quot;youth&quot;) is said to be typical.
The rear portion of the boat became the &quot;boatman&#x27;s cabin&quot;, familiar from picture postcards and museums, famous for its space-saving ingenuity and interior made attractive by a warm stove, a steaming kettle, gleaming brass, fancy lace, painted housewares and decorated plates. Such descriptions rarely consider the actual comfort of a (sometimes large) family, working brutally hard and long days, sleeping in one tiny cabin. However many shore-bound workers endured harder indoor trades in less healthy conditions and in worse accommodation, where the family was separated for long hours rather than being together all day. The lifestyle afloat, by definition itinerant, made it impossible for children to attend school. Most boat people were effectively illiterate and ostracised by those living &quot;on the bank&quot;, who considered themselves superior.

As steam and diesel progressively replaced the tow-horse in the early years of the 20th century, it became possible to move even more cargo with fewer hands by towing a second, un-powered boat, referred to as a &quot;butty&quot;, &quot;buttyboat&quot; or &quot;butty boat&quot;. Although there was no longer a horse to maintain, the butty had to be steered while being towed. So that the butty boatman could lengthen or shorten towline as needed, the towline wasn&#x27;t tied-off on the bow, instead travelled over the buttyboat through permanent running blocks on stands or retractable middle masts and managed in the stern. On a wide canal, such as the Grand Union Canal, the pair could be roped side-to-side (&quot;breasted up&quot;) and handled as a unit through working locks.
Cargo-carrying by narrow boat diminished from 1945 and the last regular long-distance traffic disappeared in 1970. However, some traffic continued into the 1980s and beyond. Two million tonnes of aggregate were carried on the Grand Union (River Soar) between 1976 and 1996, latterly using wide-beam barges. Aggregate continues to be carried between Denham and West Drayton on the (wide) Grand Union Canal and on the tidal estuary of Bow Creek (which is the eventual outflow of the Lee &amp; Stort Navigation).

A few people are doing their best in the 21st century to keep the tradition of canal-borne cargo-carrying alive, mostly by one-off deliveries rather than regular runs, or by selling goods such as coal to other boaters. Enthusiasts remain dedicated to restoring the remaining old narrow boats, often as members of the Historic Narrow Boat Owners Club. There are many replicas, such as &quot;Hadar&quot;, ornately painted with traditional designs, usually of roses and castles. Boats not horse-drawn may have a refurbished, slow-revving, vintage semi-diesel engine. There are some steam-driven narrow boats such as the ex-Fellows Morton &amp; Clayton steamer &quot;President&quot;.

===Painted decoration===

By the end of the 19th century it was common practice to paint roses and castles on narrow boats and their fixtures and fittings. Common sites include the doors to the cabin, the water can or barrel and the side of the boat along with ornate lettering giving the boat&#x27;s name and owner. This tradition did not happen in &quot;all&quot; regions, the Chesterfield Canal being one waterway where narrow boats never bore such decorations.

The origin of the roses and castles found on canal boats is unclear. The first written reference to them appears to be in an 1858 edition of the magazine &quot;Household Words&quot; in one of a series of articles titled &quot;On the Canal&quot;, showing that the art form must have existed by this date. For some time, a popular suggestion was that it had some form of Romani origin; however, there does not appear to be a significant link between the Romani and boating communities. Other suggestions include transfer of styles from the clock-making industry (in particular the decoration on the face), the japanning industry or the pottery industry. There is certainly a similarity in style and a geographical overlap, but no solid proof of a link. There are similar styles of folk art in Scandinavia, Germany, Turkey and Bangladesh.

In the 18th century, similar Dutch Hindeloopen paintwork would only have been a sailing barge journey away from the Thames. There is also an article in the Midland Daily Telegraph of 22 July 1914 that credits the practice of painting of water cans, at least, to a Mr Arthur Atkins.

While the practice declined as commercial use of the canals dwindled, it has seen something of a revival in recent times with the emergence of leisure boating. Narrowboat decoration with roses and castle themes is a common sight on today&#x27;s canals, although these may utilise cheaper printed vinyl transfers in place of the traditional craft of hand-painted designs.

==Modern narrowboats==

The number of licensed boats on canals and rivers managed by the Canal &amp; River Trust (CRT), a charitable trust, formerly British Waterways, was estimated at 27,000 in 2006. By 2014 this number had risen to over 30,000. There were perhaps another 5,000 unlicensed boats kept in private moorings or on other waterways in 2006. Most boats on CRT waterways are steel (or occasionally, aluminium) cruisers popularly referred to as narrowboats.

Modern leisure narrowboats are used for holidays, weekend breaks, or touring, or as permanent or part-time residences. Usually, they have steel hulls and a steel superstructure, but when they were first being developed for leisure use in the 1970s glass reinforced plastic (fibre-glass) or timber was often used above gunwale height. Newer narrowboats, say post 1990, are usually powered by modern diesel engines and may be fitted inside to a high standard.There will be at least internal headroom and often or usually similar domestic facilities as land homes: central heating, flush toilet, shower or even bath, four-ring hob, oven, grill, microwave oven, and refrigerator; some may have satellite television and mobile broadband, using 4G or LTE technology. Externally, their resemblance to traditional boats can vary from a faithful imitation (false &quot;rivets&quot;, and copies of traditional paintwork) through interpretation (clean lines and simplified paintwork) through to a free-style approach which does not try to pretend in any way that this is a traditional boat.

They are owned by individuals, shared by a group of friends (or by a more formally organised syndicate), rented out by holiday firms, or used as cruising hotels. A few boats are lived on permanently: either based in one place (though long-term moorings for residential narrowboats are currently very difficult to find) or continuously moving around the network (perhaps with a fixed location for the coldest months, when many stretches of canal are closed by repair works, &quot;stoppages&quot;).

A support infrastructure has developed to provide services to the leisure boats, with some narrowboats being used as platforms to provide services such as engine maintenance and boat surveys; while some others are used as fuel tenders, that provide diesel, solid fuel (coal and wood) and Calor Gas.

===Types===
On almost all narrowboats steering is by tiller, as was the case on all working narrow boats. The steerer stands at the stern of the boat, aft of the hatchway and/or rear doors at the top of the steps up from the cabin. The steering area comes in three basic types, each meeting different needs of maximising internal space; having a more traditional appearance; having a big enough rear deck for everyone to enjoy summer weather or long evenings; or protection outside in bad weather. Each type has its advocates. However, the boundaries are not fixed, and some boats blur the categories as new designers try out different arrangements and combinations.

====Traditional stern====

Many modern canal boats retain the traditional layout of a small open, unguarded &quot;counter&quot;, or deck, behind the rear doors from which the crew can step onto land. It is possible to steer from the counter, but this is not very safe, with the propeller churning below only one missed step away. The &quot;tiller extension&quot; allows the steerer to stand in safety on the top step, forward of the rear doors. (On a working boat, this step would have been over the top of the coal box). On cold days, the steerer can even close the rear doors behind themselves and be in relative comfort, their lower body in the warmth of the cabin, and only their upper body emerging from the hatchway and exposed to the elements. In good weather, many trad-stern steerers sit up on the hatchway edge, a high vantage point giving good all-round visibility. On trad boats, the bow &quot;well-deck&quot; forms the main outside viewing area, because the traditional stern is not large enough for anyone other than the steerer to stand on safely. Internally, trads may have an engine room forward of a traditional &quot;boatman&#x27;s cabin&quot;, or an enclosed engine tucked away out of sight and the increased living space this brings.

====Cruiser stern====

The name for this style arises from the large open rear deck resembling that of the large rear cockpits common on glass-fibre (glass-reinforced plastic or GRP) river &quot;cruisers&quot; which in turn derives from elliptical sterns used on cruisers and larger warships in the 20th century. At the stern, a &quot;cruiser&quot; narrowboat looks very different from traditional boats: the hatch and rear doors are considerably further forward than on a &quot;trad&quot;, creating a large open deck between counter and rear doors, protected by a taffrail (railing), perhaps with built-in seating, around back and sides. The large rear deck provides a good al fresco dining area or social space, allowing people to congregate on deck in good weather and the summer holiday season.

In winter (or less than perfect weather of summer) the steerer may be unprotected from the elements. The lack of an enclosed engine room means that engine heat does not contribute to keeping the boat warm and there may be &quot;wasted&quot; space above the deck area. A cruiser stern allows the engine to be located under the deck, rather than in the body of the boat. Although this may make access to the engine more of a nuisance (due to weather considerations) the whole deck can usually be lifted off in whole or in sections, allowing the operative to stand inside the engine bay. The cruiser stern has a major advantage that the engine is located entirely outside the living space. In this configuration also, it is common to find that the engine bay contains batteries, isolator switching, fuel tanks and seldom-used kit, spares and equipment.

A &quot;pram cover&quot; can be fitted to a cruiser stern. Named after a baby&#x27;s pram, this usually consists of a cloth cover on a folding metal frame. When erected, it encloses the cruiser stern, allowing more comfortable operation of the boat in cold or inclement weather.

====Semi-traditional stern====

A &quot;semi-traditional stern&quot; (or &quot;semi-trad&quot;) is a compromise to gain some of the social benefits of a cruiser stern, while retaining a more traditional design and providing some protection for the steerer in bad weather or in cooler seasons. As with the cruiser stern, the deck is extended back from the hatch and rear doors, but in this case most of the deck is protected at the sides by walls which extend back from the cabin sides – giving a more sheltered area for the steerer and companions, usually with lockers to sit on. The engine is located under the deck, much like a cruiser, again allowing a separation between the cabin and the engine bay, with the steps down to the cabin being located past the false sides of the &quot;semi-trad&quot; social area.

Semi-trad sterns can also be fitted with pram covers.

==== With a butty stern ====
A butty boat is an unpowered boat traditionally with a larger rudder with (usually) a wooden tiller (known as an &quot;elum&quot;, a corruption of &quot;helm&quot;) as the steering does not benefit from the force of water generated by the propeller so the rudder must be of a larger area. The tiller is usually removed and reversed in the rudder-post socket to get it out of the way when moored. A few butty boats have been converted into powered narrowboats like NB &quot;Sirius&quot;. The term butty is derived from the dialect word buddy, meaning companion.

====Centre cockpit====

While the vast majority of narrowboats have tiller steering at the stern, a small number of steel narrowboats dispense with the need for a rear steering deck entirely, by imitating some river cruisers in providing wheel steering from a central cockpit. This layout has the advantage (as have many Dutch barges) of enabling an aft cabin to be separate from the forward accommodation.

===Capabilities and limitations===
Narrowboats are &quot;Category D&quot; boats under the Recreational Craft Directive, intended only for navigating inlandrivers, canals and small lakesbut under the professional supervision of a suitable local pilot, limited coastal passages linking inland waterways, such as along the tidal Severn Estuary between Bristol and Sharpness, can also be safely made in calm weather. Insurers will often require a pilot for these hazardous areas, and temporary modifications to improve seaworthiness such as waterproof coverings for bow doors and air vents close to the waterline. Some intrepid boaters have crossed the English Channel in a narrowboat.

In all cases beyond inland use, familiarity with coastal safety such as:
* the expected weather, tidal streams, and navigation charts
* COLREGS, radar reflectors, and navigation lights,
* VHF communications, distress signals, and lifejackets

is strongly recommended.

<doc id="145128" wikidata="Q1296251" url="?curid=145128" title="Algorithmic efficiency">
<text>In computer science, algorithmic efficiency is a property of an algorithm which relates to the amount of computational resources used by the algorithm. Algorithmic efficiency can be thought of as analogous to engineering productivity for a repeating or continuous process.

For maximum efficiency it is desirable to minimize resource usage. However, different resources such as time and space complexity cannot be compared directly, so which of two algorithms is considered to be more efficient often depends on which measure of efficiency is considered most important.

For example, bubble sort and timsort are both algorithms to sort a list of items from smallest to largest. Bubble sort organizes the list in time proportional to the number of elements squared (formula_1, see Big O notation), but only requires a small amount of extra memory which is constant with respect to the length of the list (formula_2). Timsort sorts the list in time linearithmic (proportional to a quantity times its logarithm) in the list&#x27;s length (formula_3), but has a space requirement linear in the length of the list (formula_4). If large lists must be sorted at high speed for a given application, timsort is a better choice; however, if minimizing the memory footprint of the sorting is more important, bubble sort is a better choice.

==Background==
The importance of efficiency with respect to time was emphasized by Ada Lovelace in 1843 as applied to Charles Babbage&#x27;s mechanical analytical engine:
&quot;In almost every computation a great variety of arrangements for the succession of the processes is possible, and various considerations must influence the selections amongst them for the purposes of a calculating engine. One essential object is to choose that arrangement which shall tend to reduce to a minimum the time necessary for completing the calculation&quot;

Early electronic computers had both limited speed and limited random access memory. Therefore, a space–time trade-off occurred. A task could use a fast algorithm using a lot of memory, or it could use a slow algorithm using little memory. The engineering trade-off was therefore to use the fastest algorithm that could fit in the available memory.

Modern computers are significantly faster than early computers and have a much larger amount of memory available (gigabytes instead of kilobytes). Nevertheless, Donald Knuth emphasized that efficiency is still an important consideration:

 &quot;In established engineering disciplines a 12% improvement, easily obtained, is never considered marginal and I believe the same viewpoint should prevail in software engineering&quot;

==Overview==
An algorithm is considered efficient if its resource consumption, also known as computational cost, is at or below some acceptable level. Roughly speaking, &#x27;acceptable&#x27; means: it will run in a reasonable amount of time or space on an available computer, typically as a function of the size of the input. Since the 1950s computers have seen dramatic increases in both the available computational power and in the available amount of memory, so current acceptable levels would have been unacceptable even 10 years ago. In fact, thanks to the approximate doubling of computer power every 2 years, tasks that are acceptably efficient on modern smartphones and embedded systems may have been unacceptably inefficient for industrial servers 10 years ago.

Computer manufacturers frequently bring out new models, often with higher performance. Software costs can be quite high, so in some cases the simplest and cheapest way of getting higher performance might be to just buy a faster computer, provided it is compatible with an existing computer.

There are many ways in which the resources used by an algorithm can be measured: the two most common measures are speed and memory usage; other measures could include transmission speed, temporary disk usage, long-term disk usage, power consumption, total cost of ownership, response time to external stimuli, etc. Many of these measures depend on the size of the input to the algorithm, i.e. the amount of data to be processed. They might also depend on the way in which the data is arranged; for example, some sorting algorithms perform poorly on data which is already sorted, or which is sorted in reverse order.

In practice, there are other factors which can affect the efficiency of an algorithm, such as requirements for accuracy and/or reliability. As detailed below, the way in which an algorithm is implemented can also have a significant effect on actual efficiency, though many aspects of this relate to optimization issues.

===Theoretical analysis===
In the theoretical analysis of algorithms, the normal practice is to estimate their complexity in the asymptotic sense. The most commonly used notation to describe resource consumption or &quot;complexity&quot; is Donald Knuth&#x27;s Big O notation, representing the complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size of the input formula_5. Big O notation is an asymptotic measure of function complexity, where formula_6 roughly means the time requirement for an algorithm is proportional to formula_7, omitting lower-order terms that contribute less than formula_7 to the growth of the function as formula_5 grows arbitrarily large. This estimate may be misleading when formula_5 is small, but is generally sufficiently accurate when formula_5 is large as the notation is asymptotic. For example, bubble sort may be faster than merge sort when only a few items are to be sorted; however either implementation is likely to meet performance requirements for a small list. Typically, programmers are interested in algorithms that scale efficiently to large input sizes, and merge sort is preferred over bubble sort for lists of length encountered in most data-intensive programs.

Some examples of Big O notation applied to algorithms&#x27; asymptotic time complexity include:

===Measuring performance===
For new versions of software or to provide comparisons with competitive systems, benchmarks are sometimes used, which assist with gauging an algorithms relative performance. If a new sort algorithm is produced, for example, it can be compared with its predecessors to ensure that at least it is efficient as before with known data, taking into consideration any functional improvements. Benchmarks can be used by customers when comparing various products from alternative suppliers to estimate which product will best suit their specific requirements in terms of functionality and performance. For example, in the mainframe world certain proprietary sort products from independent software companies such as Syncsort compete with products from the major suppliers such as IBM for speed.

Some benchmarks provide opportunities for producing an analysis comparing the relative speed of various compiled and interpreted languages for example
and The Computer Language Benchmarks Game compares the performance of implementations of typical programming problems in several programming languages.

Even creating &quot;do it yourself&quot; benchmarks can demonstrate the relative performance of different programming languages, using a variety of user specified criteria. This is quite simple, as a &quot;Nine language performance roundup&quot; by Christopher W. Cowell-Shah demonstrates by example.

===Implementation concerns===
Implementation issues can also have an effect on efficiency, such as the choice of programming language, or the way in which the algorithm is actually coded, or the choice of a compiler for a particular language, or the compilation options used, or even the operating system being used. In many cases a language implemented by an interpreter may be much slower than a language implemented by a compiler. See the articles on just-in-time compilation and interpreted languages.

There are other factors which may affect time or space issues, but which may be outside of a programmer&#x27;s control; these include data alignment, data granularity, cache locality, cache coherency, garbage collection, instruction-level parallelism, multi-threading (at either a hardware or software level), simultaneous multitasking, and subroutine calls.

Some processors have capabilities for vector processing, which allow a single instruction to operate on multiple operands; it may or may not be easy for a programmer or compiler to use these capabilities. Algorithms designed for sequential processing may need to be completely redesigned to make use of parallel processing, or they could be easily reconfigured. As parallel and distributed computing grow in importance in the late 2010s, more investments are being made into efficient high-level APIs for parallel and distributed computing systems such as CUDA, TensorFlow, Hadoop, OpenMP and MPI.

Another problem which can arise in programming is that processors compatible with the same instruction set (such as x86-64 or ARM) may implement an instruction in different ways, so that instructions which are relatively fast on some models may be relatively slow on other models. This often presents challenges to optimizing compilers, which must have extensive knowledge of the specific CPU and other hardware available on the compilation target to best optimize a program for performance. In the extreme case, a compiler may be forced to emulate instructions not supported on a compilation target platform, forcing it to generate code or link an external library call to produce a result that is otherwise incomputable on that platform, even if it is natively supported and more efficient in hardware on other platforms. This is often the case in embedded systems with respect to floating-point arithmetic, where small and low-power microcontrollers often lack hardware support for floating-point arithmetic and thus require computationally expensive software routines to produce floating point calculations.

==Measures of resource usage==
Measures are normally expressed as a function of the size of the input formula_12.

The two most common measures are:
* &quot;Time&quot;: how long does the algorithm take to complete?
* &quot;Space&quot;: how much working memory (typically RAM) is needed by the algorithm? This has two aspects: the amount of memory needed by the code (auxiliary space usage), and the amount of memory needed for the data on which the code operates (intrinsic space usage).

For computers whose power is supplied by a battery (e.g. laptops and smartphones), or for very long/large calculations (e.g. supercomputers), other measures of interest are:
* &quot;Direct power consumption&quot;: power needed directly to operate the computer.
* &quot;Indirect power consumption&quot;: power needed for cooling, lighting, etc.

, power consumption is growing as an important metric for computational tasks of all types and at all scales ranging from embedded Internet of things devices to system-on-chip devices to server farms. This trend is often referred to as green computing.

Less common measures of computational efficiency may also be relevant in some cases:

*&quot;Transmission size&quot;: bandwidth could be a limiting factor. Data compression can be used to reduce the amount of data to be transmitted. Displaying a picture or image (e.g. Google logo) can result in transmitting tens of thousands of bytes (48K in this case) compared with transmitting six bytes for the text &quot;Google&quot;. This is important for I/O bound computing tasks.
*&quot;External space&quot;: space needed on a disk or other external memory device; this could be for temporary storage while the algorithm is being carried out, or it could be long-term storage needed to be carried forward for future reference.
*&quot;Response time&quot; (latency): this is particularly relevant in a real-time application when the computer system must respond quickly to some external event.
*&quot;Total cost of ownership&quot;: particularly if a computer is dedicated to one particular algorithm.

===Time===
====Theory====
Analysis of algorithms, typically using concepts like time complexity, can be used to get an estimate of the running time as a function of the size of the input data. The result is normally expressed using Big O notation. This is useful for comparing algorithms, especially when a large amount of data is to be processed. More detailed estimates are needed to compare algorithm performance when the amount of data is small, although this is likely to be of less importance. Parallel algorithms may be more difficult to analyze.

====Practice====
A benchmark can be used to assess the performance of an algorithm in practice. Many programming languages have an available function which provides CPU time usage. For long-running algorithms the elapsed time could also be of interest. Results should generally be averaged over several tests.

Run-based profiling can be very sensitive to hardware configuration and the possibility of other programs or tasks running at the same time in a multi-processing and multi-programming environment.

This sort of test also depends heavily on the selection of a particular programming language, compiler, and compiler options, so algorithms being compared must all be implemented under the same conditions.

===Space===
This section is concerned with use of memory resources (registers, cache, RAM, virtual memory, secondary memory) while the algorithm is being executed. As for time analysis above, analyze the algorithm, typically using space complexity analysis to get an estimate of the run-time memory needed as a function as the size of the input data. The result is normally expressed using Big O notation.

There are up to four aspects of memory usage to consider:
* The amount of memory needed to hold the code for the algorithm.
* The amount of memory needed for the input data.
* The amount of memory needed for any output data. 
**Some algorithms, such as sorting, often rearrange the input data and do not need any additional space for output data. This property is referred to as &quot;in-place&quot; operation.
* The amount of memory needed as working space during the calculation.
**This includes local variables and any stack space needed by routines called during a calculation; this stack space can be significant for algorithms which use recursive techniques.

Early electronic computers, and early home computers, had relatively small amounts of working memory. For example, the 1949 Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) had a maximum working memory of 1024 17-bit words, while the 1980 Sinclair ZX80 came initially with 1024 8-bit bytes of working memory. In the late 2010s, it is typical for personal computers to have between 4 and 32 GB of RAM, an increase of over 300 million times as much memory.

==== Caching and memory hierarchy ====

Modern computers can have relatively large amounts of memory (possibly gigabytes), so having to squeeze an algorithm into a confined amount of memory is not the kind of problem it used to be. However, the different types of memory and their relative access speeds can be significant:

* Processor registers, are the fastest memory with the least amount of space. Most direct computation on modern computers occurs with source and destination operands in registers before being updated to the cache, main memory and virtual memory if needed. On a processor core, there are typically on the order of hundreds of bytes or fewer of register availability, although a register file may contain more physical registers than architectural registers defined in the instruction set architecture.
* Cache memory is the second fastest, and second smallest, available in the memory hierarchy. Caches are present in processors such as CPUs or GPUs, where they are typically implemented in static RAM, though they can also be found in peripherals such as disk drives. Processor caches often have their own multi-level hierarchy; lower levels are larger, slower and typically shared between processor cores in multi-core processors. In order to process operands in cache memory, a processing unit must fetch the data from the cache, perform the operation in registers and write the data back to the cache. This operates at speeds comparable (about 2-10 times slower) with the CPU or GPU&#x27;s arithmetic logic unit or floating-point unit if in the L1 cache. It is about 10 times slower if there is an L1 cache miss and it must be retrieved from and written to the L2 cache, and a further 10 times slower if there is an L2 cache miss and it must be retrieved from an L3 cache, if present.
* Main physical memory is most often implemented in dynamic RAM (DRAM). The main memory is much larger (typically gigabytes compared to ≈8 megabytes) than an L3 CPU cache, with read and write latencies typically 10-100 times slower. , RAM is increasingly implemented on-chip of processors, as CPU or GPU memory.
* Paged memory, often used for virtual memory management, is memory stored in secondary storage such as a hard disk, and is an extension to the memory hierarchy which allows use of a potentially larger storage space, at the cost of much higher latency, typically around 1000 times slower than a cache miss for a value in RAM. While originally motivated to create the impression of higher amounts of memory being available than were truly available, virtual memory is more important in contemporary usage for its time-space tradeoff and enabling the usage of virtual machines. Cache misses from main memory are called page faults, and incur huge performance penalties on programs.

An algorithm whose memory needs will fit in cache memory will be much faster than an algorithm which fits in main memory, which in turn will be very much faster than an algorithm which has to resort to paging. Because of this, cache replacement policies are extremely important to high-performance computing, as are cache-aware programming and data alignment. To further complicate the issue, some systems have up to three levels of cache memory, with varying effective speeds. Different systems will have different amounts of these various types of memory, so the effect of algorithm memory needs can vary greatly from one system to another.

In the early days of electronic computing, if an algorithm and its data would not fit in main memory then the algorithm could not be used. Nowadays the use of virtual memory appears to provide much more memory, but at the cost of performance. Much higher speed can be obtained if an algorithm and its data fit in cache memory; in this case minimizing space will also help minimize time. This is called the principle of locality, and can be subdivided into locality of reference, spatial locality, and temporal locality. An algorithm which will not fit completely in cache memory but which exhibits locality of reference may perform reasonably well.

<text>Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli ( , , ; 14 March 1835 – 4 July 1910) was an Italian astronomer and science historian.

== Biography ==

He studied at the University of Turin, graduating in 1854, and later did research at Berlin Observatory, under Encke. In 1859–1860 he worked in Pulkovo Observatory near St Petersburg, and then worked for over forty years at Brera Observatory in Milan. He was also a senator of the Kingdom of Italy, a member of the Accademia dei Lincei, the Accademia delle Scienze di Torino and the Regio Istituto Lombardo, and is particularly known for his studies of Mars.

== Mars ==

Among Schiaparelli&#x27;s contributions are his telescopic observations of Mars. In his initial observations, he named the &quot;seas&quot; and &quot;continents&quot; of Mars. During the planet&#x27;s &quot;great opposition&quot; of 1877, he observed a dense network of linear structures on the surface of Mars, which he called in Italian, meaning &quot;channels&quot;, but the term was mistranslated into English as &quot;canals&quot;.

While the term &quot;canals&quot; indicates an artificial construction, the term &quot;channels&quot; connotes that the observed features were natural configurations of the planetary surface. From the incorrect translation into the term &quot;canals&quot;, various assumptions were made about life on Mars; as these assumptions were popularized, the &quot;canals&quot; of Mars became famous, giving rise to waves of hypotheses, speculation, and folklore about the possibility of Martians, intelligent life living on Mars. Among the most fervent supporters of the artificial-canal hypothesis was the American astronomer Percival Lowell, who spent much of his life trying to prove the existence of intelligent life on the red planet. After Lowell&#x27;s death in 1916, astronomers developed a consensus against the canal hypothesis, but the popular concept of Martian canals excavated by intelligent Martians remained in the public mind for the first half of the 20th century and inspired a corpus of works of classic science fiction.

Later, with notable thanks to the observations of the Italian astronomer Vincenzo Cerulli, scientists came to the conclusion that the famous channels were actually mere optical illusions. The last popular speculations about canals were finally put to rest during the spaceflight era beginning in the 1960s, when visiting spacecraft such as Mariner 4 photographed the surface with much higher resolution than Earth-based telescopes, confirming that there are no structures resembling &quot;canals&quot;.

In his book &quot;Life on Mars&quot;, Schiaparelli wrote: &quot;Rather than true channels in a form familiar to us, we must imagine depressions in the soil that are not very deep, extended in a straight direction for thousands of miles, over a width of 100, 200 kilometres and maybe more. I have already pointed out that, in the absence of rain on Mars, these channels are probably the main mechanism by which the water (and with it organic life) can spread on the dry surface of the planet.&quot;

== Astronomy and history of science ==

An observer of objects in the Solar System, Schiaparelli worked on binary stars, discovered the large main-belt asteroid 69 Hesperia on 29 April 1861, and demonstrated that the meteor showers were associated with comets. He proved, for example, that the orbit of the Leonid meteor shower coincided with that of the comet Tempel-Tuttle. These observations led the astronomer to formulate the hypothesis, subsequently proved to be correct, that the meteor showers could be the trails of comets. He was also a keen observer of the inner planets Mercury and Venus. He made several drawings and determined their rotation periods. In 1965, it was shown that his and most other subsequent measurements of Mercury&#x27;s period were incorrect.

Schiaparelli was a scholar of the history of classical astronomy. He was the first to realize that the concentric spheres of Eudoxus of Cnidus and Callippus, unlike those used by many astronomers of later times, were not to be taken as material objects, but only as part of an algorithm similar to the modern Fourier series.

He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1901.

<text>A wherry is a type of boat that was traditionally used for carrying cargo or passengers on rivers and canals in England, and is particularly associated with the River Thames and the River Cam. They were also used on the Broadland rivers of Norfolk and Suffolk.

==Regional usage in Great Britain==
London passenger wherries evolved into the Thames skiff, a gentleman&#x27;s rowing boat. Wherries were clinker-built with long overhanging bows so that patrons could step ashore dryshod before landing stages were built along the river. It is the long angled bow that distinguishes the wherry and skiff from the gig and cutter which have steeper bows following the rise of the Royal Navy, and the building of landing stages.

The use of wherries on the River Cam in Cambridge was common and is described by Daniel Defoe in his journey through England. The use of wherries on the River Cam preceded the popularity of punting by Cambridge University students. By the late 18th century, a name was given to the Norfolk wherry, a kind of sailing barge with large sails which was developed to replace an earlier cargo boat, the Norfolk Keel.

The term wherry is also associated with a particular type of lighter used on the River Tyne largely in connection with the coal trade. The last complete example &quot;Elswick No.2&quot; is owned by Tyne &amp; Wear Archives &amp; Museums service. There is a well documented study of the last surviving wrecked examples as surveyed in 2009.

There is firm attestation that the term was used in the Irish Sea. Vessels like &quot;Manx wherries&quot; and &quot;shell wherries&quot; (the latter evidently based in Kirkcudbright for the shell fishery) are recorded in the early 19th century. Three shell wherries at least were active in 1810 and known to be of 10–12 tons and clinker built.

==Regional usage in Ireland==
Wherries were used by the fishermen of Skerries and other ports of the Irish sea north of Dublin in the 18th and 19th century. These wherries generally had two or three masts with a mainsail on the aft mast, and a foresail on the forward mast. Due to the lower height of the rig, they were more manageable in strong winds. 
The east coast Wherries from Rush, Skerries and Balbriggan were famously decked, clincher built, and schooner rigged. Many of them travelled as far as Scotland and some were even employed in the smuggling trade.By 1866 they had been replaced by more efficient boats of carvel construction. 

== Thames history ==

The term &quot;wherry&quot; or &quot;wherrie&quot; was a regular term used for a boat as the Coverdale Bible of 1535 speaks of &quot;All whirry men, and all maryners vpo the see…&quot; in the Book of Ezekiel.

Wherries along the tideway in London were water taxis operated by watermen and in Elizabethan times their use was widespread. A wherry could be rowed by two men with long oars or by a single waterman using short oars or &#x27;sculls&#x27;. An Act of Parliament in 1555 specified that a wherry should be &quot;22½ feet long and 4½ wide &#x27;amidships&#x27;&quot;. and could carry up to five passengers. According to one account concerning Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe Theatre, &quot;Patrons were transported across the River Thames to Southwark by &#x27;wherry boats&#x27;. At one time over two thousand wherries made their way to and from the theatre district.&quot;

During the eighteenth century rowing competitions for watermen became established on the Thames, and the prize was often a new wherry. The Sporting Magazine describes an event on 6 August 1795 as &quot;the contest for the annual wherry given by the Proprietors of Vauxhall by six pairs of oars in three heats&quot;. In 1822 &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life&quot; reported on a contest on 30 June between eight watermen belonging to the Temple Stairs for &quot;a prize wherry given by the gentlemen of the Inns of Court&quot; and on 31 July &quot;the anniversary of the Grand Aquatic Regatta of the inhabitants of Queenhithe&quot;, when &quot;a handsome Wherry&quot; and other prizes were contended for by &quot;six of the free watermen belonging to those stairs&quot;. In 1820 there were still 3,000 wherries plying on the Thames, while in the same year there were only 1,200 hackney coaches. As late as 1829, the usual means of crossing the river from Westminster to Vauxhall was by boat, but the wherryman&#x27;s trade came to an end when new bridges were built and cheap steamboats were put on the river.

==North American usage==
In North America, particularly in the Penobscot Bay region of the Gulf of Maine, wherries became the preferred boat for the longshore Atlantic salmon fishery. The Lincolnville Salmon Wherry, the Rhodes Wherry, the Duck Trap Wherry, and the Christmas Wherry are still being built for recreational use. They are generally long and narrow, with a straight stem, a wineglass stern and usually carvel planked (smooth sides). John Gardner writes that the single characteristic that distinguishes a wherry is its flat bottom that allows the boat to ground out in an upright position and serves as a shoe for dragging the boat up and down the beach. The boat usually has two seats, one for the rower, and one in the stern sheets for the passenger, although longer ones can have a third seat forward. The term &quot;shell wherry&quot; was recognised in 19th-century America.

<doc id="145132" wikidata="Q254347" url="?curid=145132" title="Dedekind domain">
<text>In abstract algebra, a Dedekind domain or Dedekind ring, named after Richard Dedekind, is an integral domain in which every nonzero proper ideal factors into a product of prime ideals. It can be shown that such a factorization is then necessarily unique up to the order of the factors. There are at least three other characterizations of Dedekind domains that are sometimes taken as the definition: see below.

A field is a commutative ring in which there are no nontrivial proper ideals, so that any field is a Dedekind domain, however in a rather vacuous way. Some authors add the requirement that a Dedekind domain not be a field. Many more authors state theorems for Dedekind domains with the implicit proviso that they may require trivial modifications for the case of fields.

An immediate consequence of the definition is that every principal ideal domain (PID) is a Dedekind domain. In fact a Dedekind domain is a unique factorization domain (UFD) if and only if it is a PID.

== The prehistory of Dedekind domains ==
In the 19th century it became a common technique to gain insight into integer solutions of polynomial equations using rings of algebraic numbers of higher degree. For instance, fix a positive integer formula_1. In the attempt to determine which integers are represented by the quadratic form formula_2, it is natural to factor the quadratic form into formula_3, the factorization taking place in the ring of integers of the quadratic field formula_4. Similarly, for a positive integer formula_5 the polynomial formula_6 (which is relevant for solving the Fermat equation formula_7) can be factored over the ring formula_8, where formula_9 is a primitive &quot;n&quot;-th root of unity.

For a few small values of formula_1 and formula_5 these rings of algebraic integers are PIDs, and this can be seen as an explanation of the classical successes of Fermat (formula_12) and Euler (formula_13). By this time a procedure for determining whether the ring of all algebraic integers of a given quadratic field formula_14 is a PID was well known to the quadratic form theorists. Especially, Gauss had looked at the case of imaginary quadratic fields: he found exactly nine values of formula_15 for which the ring of integers is a PID and conjectured that there were no further values. (Gauss&#x27;s conjecture was proven more than one hundred years later by Kurt Heegner, Alan Baker and Harold Stark.) However, this was understood (only) in the language of equivalence classes of quadratic forms, so that in particular the analogy between quadratic forms and the Fermat equation seems not to have been perceived. In 1847 Gabriel Lamé announced a solution of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem for all formula_16; that is, that the Fermat equation has no solutions in nonzero integers, but it turned out that his solution hinged on the assumption that the cyclotomic ring formula_8 is a UFD. Ernst Kummer had shown three years before that this was not the case already for formula_18 (the full, finite list of values for which formula_8 is a UFD is now known). At the same time, Kummer developed powerful new methods to prove Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem at least for a large class of prime exponents formula_5 using what we now recognize as the fact that the ring formula_8 is a Dedekind domain. In fact Kummer worked not with ideals but with &quot;ideal numbers&quot;, and the modern definition of an ideal was given by Dedekind.

By the 20th century, algebraists and number theorists had come to realize that the condition of being a PID is rather delicate, whereas the condition of being a Dedekind domain is quite robust. For instance the ring of ordinary integers is a PID, but as seen above the ring formula_22 of algebraic integers in a number field formula_23 need not be a PID. In fact, although Gauss also conjectured that there are infinitely many primes formula_24 such that the ring of integers of formula_25 is a PID, it is not yet known whether there are infinitely many number fields formula_23 (of arbitrary degree) such that formula_22 is a PID. On the other hand, the ring of integers in a number field is always a Dedekind domain.

Another illustration of the delicate/robust dichotomy is the fact that being a Dedekind domain is, among Noetherian domains, a local property: a Noetherian domain formula_28 is Dedekind iff for every maximal ideal formula_29 of formula_28 the localization formula_31 is a Dedekind ring. But a local domain is a Dedekind ring iff it is a PID iff it is a discrete valuation ring (DVR), so the same local characterization cannot hold for PIDs: rather, one may say that the concept of a Dedekind ring is the globalization of that of a DVR.

== Alternative definitions ==
For an integral domain formula_28 that is not a field, all of the following conditions are equivalent:

:(DD1) Every nonzero proper ideal factors into primes.
:(DD2) formula_28 is Noetherian, and the localization at each maximal ideal is a discrete valuation ring.
:(DD3) Every nonzero fractional ideal of formula_28 is invertible.
:(DD4) formula_28 is an integrally closed, Noetherian domain with Krull dimension one (that is, every nonzero prime ideal is maximal).
:(DD5) For any two ideals formula_36 and formula_37 in formula_28, formula_36 is contained in formula_37 if and only if formula_37 divides formula_36 as ideals. That is, there exists an ideal formula_43 such that formula_44. A commutative ring (not necessarily a domain) with unity satisfying this condition is called a containment-division ring (CDR).

Thus a Dedekind domain is a domain that either is a field, or satisfies any one, and hence all five, of (DD1) through (DD5). Which of these conditions one takes as the definition is therefore merely a matter of taste. In practice, it is often easiest to verify (DD4).

A Krull domain is a higher-dimensional analog of a Dedekind domain: a Dedekind domain that is not a field is a Krull domain of dimension 1. This notion can be used to study the various characterizations of a Dedekind domain. In fact, this is the definition of a Dedekind domain used in Bourbaki&#x27;s &quot;Commutative algebra&quot;.

A Dedekind domain can also be characterized in terms of homological algebra: an integral domain is a Dedekind domain if and only if it is a hereditary ring; that is, every submodule of a projective module over it is projective. Similarly, an integral domain is a Dedekind domain if and only if every divisible module over it is injective.

== Some examples of Dedekind domains ==

All principal ideal domains and therefore all discrete valuation rings are Dedekind domains.

The ring formula_45 of algebraic integers in a number field &quot;K&quot; is Noetherian, integrally closed, and of dimension one: to see the last property, observe that for any nonzero prime ideal &quot;I&quot; of &quot;R&quot;, &quot;R&quot;/&quot;I&quot; is a finite set, and recall that a finite integral domain is a field; so by (DD4) &quot;R&quot; is a Dedekind domain. As above, this includes all the examples considered by Kummer and Dedekind and was the motivating case for the general definition, and these remain among the most studied examples.

The other class of Dedekind rings that is arguably of equal importance comes from geometry: let &quot;C&quot; be a nonsingular geometrically integral affine algebraic curve over a field &quot;k&quot;. Then the coordinate ring &quot;k&quot;[&quot;C&quot;] of regular functions on &quot;C&quot; is a Dedekind domain. This is largely clear simply from translating geometric terms into algebra: the coordinate ring of any affine variety is, by definition, a finitely generated &quot;k&quot;-algebra, hence Noetherian; moreover &quot;curve&quot; means &quot;dimension one&quot; and &quot;nonsingular&quot; implies (and, in dimension one, is equivalent to) &quot;normal&quot;, which by definition means &quot;integrally closed&quot;.

Both of these constructions can be viewed as special cases of the following basic result:

Theorem: Let &quot;R&quot; be a Dedekind domain with fraction field &quot;K&quot;. Let &quot;L&quot; be a finite degree field extension of &quot;K&quot; and denote by &quot;S&quot; the integral closure of &quot;R&quot; in &quot;L&quot;. Then &quot;S&quot; is itself a Dedekind domain.

Applying this theorem when &quot;R&quot; is itself a PID gives us a way of building Dedekind domains out of PIDs. Taking &quot;R&quot; = Z, this construction says precisely that rings of integers of number fields are Dedekind domains. Taking &quot;R&quot; = &quot;k&quot;[&quot;t&quot;], one obtains the above case of nonsingular affine curves as branched coverings of the affine line.

Zariski and Samuel were sufficiently taken with this construction to ask whether every Dedekind domain arises from it; that is, by starting with a PID and taking the integral closure in a finite degree field extension. A surprisingly simple negative answer was given by L. Claborn.

If the situation is as above but the extension &quot;L&quot; of &quot;K&quot; is algebraic of infinite degree, then it is still possible for the integral closure &quot;S&quot; of &quot;R&quot; in &quot;L&quot; to be a Dedekind domain, but it is not guaranteed. For example, take again &quot;R&quot; = Z, &quot;K&quot; = Q and now take &quot;L&quot; to be the field formula_46 of all algebraic numbers. The integral closure is nothing else than the ring formula_47 of all algebraic integers. Since the square root of an algebraic integer is again an algebraic integer, it is not possible to factor any nonzero nonunit algebraic integer into a finite product of irreducible elements, which implies that formula_47 is not even Noetherian! In general, the integral closure of a Dedekind domain in an infinite algebraic extension is a Prüfer domain; it turns out that the ring of algebraic integers is slightly more special than this: it is a Bézout domain.

== Fractional ideals and the class group ==
Let &quot;R&quot; be an integral domain with fraction field &quot;K&quot;. A fractional ideal is a nonzero &quot;R&quot;-submodule &quot;I&quot; of &quot;K&quot; for which there exists a nonzero &quot;x&quot; in &quot;K&quot; such that formula_49

Given two fractional ideals &quot;I&quot; and &quot;J&quot;, one defines their product &quot;IJ&quot; as the set of all finite sums formula_50: the product &quot;IJ&quot; is again a fractional ideal. The set Frac(&quot;R&quot;) of all fractional ideals endowed with the above product is a commutative semigroup and in fact a monoid: the identity element is the fractional ideal &quot;R&quot;.

For any fractional ideal &quot;I&quot;, one may define the fractional ideal

: formula_51

One then tautologically has formula_52. In fact one has equality if and only if &quot;I&quot;, as an element of the monoid of Frac(&quot;R&quot;), is invertible. In other words, if &quot;I&quot; has any inverse, then the inverse must be formula_53.

A principal fractional ideal is one of the form formula_54 for some nonzero &quot;x&quot; in &quot;K&quot;. Note that each principal fractional ideal is invertible, the inverse of formula_54 being simply formula_56. We denote the subgroup of principal fractional ideals by Prin(&quot;R&quot;).

A domain &quot;R&quot; is a PID if and only if every fractional ideal is principal. In this case, we have Frac(&quot;R&quot;) = Prin(&quot;R&quot;) = formula_57, since two principal fractional ideals formula_54 and formula_59 are equal iff formula_60 is a unit in &quot;R&quot;.

For a general domain &quot;R&quot;, it is meaningful to take the quotient of the monoid Frac(&quot;R&quot;) of all fractional ideals by the submonoid Prin(&quot;R&quot;) of principal fractional ideals. However this quotient itself is generally only a monoid. In fact it is easy to see that the class of a fractional ideal I in Frac(&quot;R&quot;)/Prin(&quot;R&quot;) is invertible if and only if I itself is invertible.

Now we can appreciate (DD3): in a Dedekind domain (and only in a Dedekind domain) every fractional ideal is invertible. Thus these are precisely the class of domains for which Frac(&quot;R&quot;)/Prin(&quot;R&quot;) forms a group, the ideal class group Cl(&quot;R&quot;) of &quot;R&quot;. This group is trivial if and only if &quot;R&quot; is a PID, so can be viewed as quantifying the obstruction to a general Dedekind domain being a PID.

We note that for an arbitrary domain one may define the Picard group Pic(&quot;R&quot;) as the group of invertible fractional ideals Inv(&quot;R&quot;) modulo the subgroup of principal fractional ideals. For a Dedekind domain this is of course the same as the ideal class group. However, on a more general class of domains, including Noetherian domains and Krull domains, the ideal class group is constructed in a different way, and there is a canonical homomorphism

:Pic(&quot;R&quot;) → Cl(&quot;R&quot;)

which is however generally neither injective nor surjective. This is an affine analogue of the distinction between Cartier divisors and Weil divisors on a singular algebraic variety.

A remarkable theorem of L. Claborn (Claborn 1966) asserts that for any abelian group &quot;G&quot; whatsoever, there exists a Dedekind domain &quot;R&quot; whose ideal class group is isomorphic to &quot;G&quot;. Later, C.R. Leedham-Green showed that such an &quot;R&quot; may be constructed as the integral closure of a PID in a quadratic field extension (Leedham-Green 1972). In 1976, M. Rosen showed how to realize any countable abelian group as the class group of a Dedekind domain that is a subring of the rational function field of an elliptic curve, and conjectured that such an &quot;elliptic&quot; construction should be possible for a general abelian group (Rosen 1976). Rosen&#x27;s conjecture was proven in 2008 by P.L. Clark (Clark 2009).

In contrast, one of the basic theorems in algebraic number theory asserts that the class group of the ring of integers of a number field is finite; its cardinality is called the class number and it is an important and rather mysterious invariant, notwithstanding the hard work of many leading mathematicians from Gauss to the present day.

== Finitely generated modules over a Dedekind domain ==

In view of the well known and exceedingly useful structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain (PID), it is natural to ask for a corresponding theory for finitely generated modules over a Dedekind domain.

Let us briefly recall the structure theory in the case of a finitely generated module formula_29 over a PID formula_28. We define the torsion submodule formula_63 to be the set of elements formula_1 of formula_29 such that formula_66 for some nonzero formula_67 in formula_28. Then:

(M1) formula_63 can be decomposed into a direct sum of cyclic torsion modules, each of the form formula_70 for some nonzero ideal formula_36 of formula_28. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, each formula_70 can further be decomposed into a direct sum of submodules of the form formula_74, where formula_75 is a power of a prime ideal. This decomposition need not be unique, but any two decompositions

: formula_76

differ only in the order of the factors.

(M2) The torsion submodule is a direct summand. That is, there exists a complementary submodule formula_77 of formula_29 such that formula_79.

(M3PID) formula_77 isomorphic to formula_81 for a uniquely determined non-negative integer formula_5. In particular, formula_77 is a finitely generated free module.

Now let formula_29 be a finitely generated module over an arbitrary Dedekind domain formula_28. Then (M1) and (M2) hold verbatim. However, it follows from (M3PID) that a finitely generated torsionfree module formula_77 over a PID is free. In particular, it asserts that all fractional ideals are principal, a statement that is false whenever formula_28 is not a PID. In other words, the nontriviality of the class group formula_88 causes (M3PID) to fail. Remarkably, the additional structure in torsionfree finitely generated modules over an arbitrary Dedekind domain is precisely controlled by the class group, as we now explain. Over an arbitrary Dedekind domain one has

(M3DD) formula_77 is isomorphic to a direct sum of rank one projective modules: formula_90. Moreover, for any rank one projective modules formula_91, one has

: formula_92

if and only if

: formula_93

and

: formula_94

Rank one projective modules can be identified with fractional ideals, and the last condition can be rephrased as

: formula_95

Thus a finitely generated torsionfree module of rank formula_96 can be expressed as formula_97, where formula_36 is a rank one projective module. The Steinitz class for formula_77 over formula_28 is the class formula_101 of formula_36 in formula_88: it is uniquely determined. A consequence of this is:

Theorem: Let formula_28 be a Dedekind domain. Then formula_105, where formula_106 is the Grothendieck group of the commutative monoid of finitely generated projective formula_28 modules.

These results were established by Ernst Steinitz in 1912.

An additional consequence of this structure, which is not implicit in the preceding theorem, is that if the two projective modules over a Dedekind domain have the same class in the Grothendieck group, then they are in fact abstractly isomorphic.

== Locally Dedekind rings ==

There exist integral domains formula_28 that are locally but not globally Dedekind: the localization of formula_28 at each maximal ideal is a Dedekind ring (equivalently, a DVR) but formula_28 itself is not Dedekind. As mentioned above, such a ring cannot be Noetherian. It seems that the first examples of such rings were constructed by N. Nakano in 1953. In the literature such rings are sometimes called &quot;proper almost Dedekind rings&quot;.

<text>Ionic or Ionian Greek () was a subdialect of the Eastern or Attic–Ionic dialect group of Ancient Greek. The Ionic group traditionally comprises three dialectal varieties that were spoken in Euboea (West Ionic), the northern Cyclades (Central Ionic), and from BC onward in Asiatic Ionia (East Ionic), where Ionian colonists from Athens founded their cities. Ionic was the base of several literary language forms of the Archaic and Classical periods, both in poetry and prose. The works of Homer and Hesiod are among the most popular poetic works that were written in a literary form of the Ionic dialect, known as Epic or Homeric Greek. The oldest Greek prose, including that of Heraclitus, Herodotus, Democritus, and Hippocrates, was also written in Ionic. By the end of the 5th century BC, Ionic was supplanted by Attic, which had become the dominant dialect of the Greek world.

==History==
The Ionic dialect appears to have originally spread from the Greek mainland across the Aegean at the time of the Dorian invasions, around the 11th century BC, during the early Greek Dark Ages. According to tradition, the ancestors of Ionians first set out from Athens, in a series of migrations, to establish their colonies on the coast of Asia Minor and the islands of the Cyclades, around the beginning of the Protogeometric period (1075/1050BC). Between the 11th and 9th century BC, the Ionians continued to spread around those areas. The linguistic affinity of Attic and Ionic is evident in several unique features, like the early loss of /w/, or the merger of /ā/ and /ē/, as seen in both dialects.

By the end of Archaic Greece and early Classical Greece in the 5th century BC, the central west coast of Asia Minor, along with the islands of Chios and Samos, formed the heartland of Ionia proper. The Ionic dialect was also spoken on islands across the central Aegean and on the large island of Euboea north of Athens. The dialect was soon spread by Ionian colonization to areas in the northern Aegean, the Black Sea, and the western Mediterranean, including Magna Graecia in Sicily and Italy.

The Ionic dialect is generally divided into two major time periods, Old Ionic (or Old Ionian) and New Ionic (or New Ionian). The transition between the two is not clearly defined, but 600BC is a good approximation.

The works of Homer (&quot;The Iliad&quot;, &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, and the Homeric Hymns) and of Hesiod were written in a literary dialect called Homeric Greek or Epic Greek, which largely comprises Old Ionic, but with some admixture from the neighboring Aeolic dialect to the north, as well as with some Mycenaean elements as a result of a long pre-Homeric epic tradition. This Epic Ionic was used in all later hexametric and elegiac poetry, not only by Ionians, but also by foreigners such as the Boeotian Hesiod. Ionic would become the conventional dialect used for specific poetical and literary genres. Ιt was used by many authors, regardless of their origin; like the Dorian Tyrtaeus, composing elegies in a form of Ionic. This ability of poets to switch between dialects would eventually temper regional differences, while contributing to the awareness of the Greekness that all dialects had in common. The poet Archilochus wrote in late Old Ionic.

The most famous New Ionic authors are Anacreon, Theognis, Herodotus, Hippocrates, and, in Roman times, Aretaeus, Arrian, and the Lucianic or Pseudo-Lucianic &quot;On the Syrian Goddess&quot;.

Ionic acquired prestige among Greek speakers because of its association with the language used by both Homer and Herodotus and the close linguistic relationship with the Attic dialect as spoken in Athens. This was further enhanced by the writing reform implemented in Athens in 403BC, whereby the old Attic alphabet was replaced by the Ionic alphabet, as used by the city of Miletus. This alphabet eventually became the standard Greek alphabet, its use becoming uniform during the Koine era. It was also the alphabet used in the Christian Gospels and the book of Acts.

== Ionic subdialects ==

On the basis of inscriptions, three subdialects of Ionic may be discerned:

1. Western Ionic, the dialect of Euboea and parts of Attica, like Oropos;

2. Central or Cycladic Ionic, the dialect of the Cycladic Islands;

3. Eastern Ionic, the dialect of Samos, Chios, and the west coast of Asia Minor.

Eastern Ionic stands apart from both other dialects because it lost at a very early time the /h/ sound (psilosis) (Herodotos should therefore properly be called Erodotos). The /w/ sound (digamma) is also completely absent from Eastern Ionic, but was sometimes retained in Western and Cycladic Ionic. Also pronouns that begin with /hop-/ in Western and Cycladic Ionic (ὅπου &quot;where&quot;, ὅπως &quot;how&quot;), begin with ok- (conventionally written hok-) in Eastern Ionic (ὅκου/ὄκου, ὅκως/ὄκως).

Western Ionic differs from Cycladic and Eastern Ionic by the sounds -tt- and -rr- where the other two have -ss- and -rs- (τέτταρες vs. τέσσαρες, &quot;four&quot;; θάρρος vs. θάρσος, &quot;bravery&quot;). Western Ionic also stands apart by using the form ξένος (xenos, &quot;foreigner, guest&quot;), where the other two use ξεῖνος (xeinos).

Cycladic Ionic may be further subdivided: Keos, Naxos, and Amorgos retained a difference between two /æ/ sounds, namely original /æ/ (written as Ε), and /æ/ evolved from /ā/ (written as Η); for example ΜΗΤΕΡ = μήτηρ &lt; μάτηρ, &quot;mother&quot;. On the other Cycladic Islands this distinction was not made, Η and Ε were used there interchangeably.

Within Eastern Ionic, Herodotus recognized four subgroups (&quot;Histories&quot;, I.142), three of them apparently influenced by a neighbouring language:

a. The dialect of Miletus, Myus, and Priene, and their colonies, influenced by Carian;

b. The Ionic of Ephesos, Kolophon, Lebedos, Teos, Klazomenai, and Phokaia, and their colonies, influenced by Lydian;

c. The dialect of Chios and Erythrai and their colonies, influenced by Aeolic Greek;

d. The dialect of Samos and its colonies.

Differences between these four groups are not clearly visible from inscriptions, probably because inscriptions were usually ordered by a high social group that everywhere spoke the same kind of &quot;civilized Ionic&quot;. However, local speech by the &quot;man in the street&quot; must have shown differences. An inkling of this may be witnessed in the language of Ephesian &quot;beggar poet&quot; Hipponax, who often used local slang (νικύρτας, σάβαυνις: terms of abuse; χλούνης, &quot;thief&quot;; κασωρικός, &quot;whorish&quot;) and Lydian loanwords (πάλμυς, &quot;king&quot;).

For the purposes of local government, it falls within the district of North Norfolk.

The villages name origin is unsure possibly, &#x27;Luda&#x27;s homestead/village&#x27; but perhaps, &#x27;homestead/village on the Hlude (= noisy one)&#x27;, an old name for Womack Water.

Ludham Hall was the former bishop&#x27;s palace with a chapel now used as a barn. A palace of Bishops of Norwich it burnt down in 1611, and was rebuilt by Bishop Samuel Harsnett, with the chapel added 1627. The house of flint with ashlar quoins and some brick was refaced in the late 18th century in brick.

It is part of the Ludham - Potter Heigham NNR, a national nature reserve.

The village gave its name to a , and also, in geology, to an age/stage (the Ludhamian) in the British regional subdivision of the Pleistocene Series/Epoch. It also effectively gives its name to the preceding age/underlying stage known as the Pre-Ludhamian.

==RAF Ludham==

The airfield at Ludham was built by Richard Costain Ltd and became operational in November 1941 as a second satellite for the main fighter station at RAF Coltishall sited north of Norwich, three tarmac-covered concrete runways and ancillary buildings being built on the land which had belonged to Fritton Farm. A total of ten RAF fighter squadrons (eight flying various marks of Supermarine Spitfire and two flying the Hawker Typhoon 1b) were based here between December 1941 and July 1945.

==Film location==
Ludham was one of the film locations for the 1954 movie &quot;Conflict of Wings&quot; starring John Gregson and Muriel Pavlow. Adapted from the novel by Don Sharp, the story takes place in a Norfolk country village where the locals decide to fight against a proposal to build an air-firing range on an island used as a bird sanctuary.

Filming took place in the village centre, and shows many buildings and features (including the Bakers Arms pub and the very narrow main road through the village) which no longer exist.

A photograph showing filming and more information about Ludham can be accessed at the Ludham Community Archive website.

<doc id="145140" wikidata="Q16155031" url="?curid=145140" title="Back Orifice 2000">
<text>Back Orifice 2000 (often shortened to BO2k) is a computer program designed for remote system administration. It enables a user to control a computer running the Microsoft Windows operating system from a remote location. The name is a pun on Microsoft BackOffice Server software.

BO2k debuted on July 10, 1999, at DEF CON 7, a computer security convention in Las Vegas, Nevada. It was originally written by Dildog, a member of US hacker group Cult of the Dead Cow. It was a successor to the cDc&#x27;s Back Orifice remote administration tool, released the previous year. , BO2k was being actively developed.

Whereas the original Back Orifice was limited to the Windows 95 and Windows 98 operating systems, BO2k also supports Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Windows XP. Some BO2k client functionality has also been implemented for Linux systems. In addition, BO2k was released as free software, which allows one to port it to other operating systems.

== Plugins ==
BO2k has a plugin architecture. The optional plugins include:
* communication encryption with AES, Serpent, CAST-256, IDEA or Blowfish encryption algorithms
* network address altering notification by email and CGI
* total remote file control
* remote Windows registry editing
* watching at the desktop remotely by streaming video
* remote control of both the keyboard and the mouse
* a chat, allowing administrator to discuss with users
* option to hide things from system (rootkit behavior, based on FU Rootkit)
* accessing systems hidden by a firewall (the administrated system can form a connection outward to the administrator&#x27;s computer. Optionally, to escape even more connection problems, the communication can be done by a web browser the user uses to surf the web.)
* forming connection chains through a number of administrated systems
* client-less remote administration over IRC
* on-line keypress recording

== Controversy ==
Back Orifice and Back Orifice 2000 are widely regarded as malware, tools intended to be used as a combined rootkit and backdoor. For example, at present many antivirus software packages identify them as Trojan horses. This classification is justified by the fact that BO2k can be installed by a Trojan horse, in cases where it is used by an unauthorized user, unbeknownst to the system administrator.

There are several reasons for this, including: the association with cDc; the tone of the initial product launch at DEF CON (including that the first distribution of BO2k by cDc was infected by the CIH virus); the existence of tools (such as &quot;Silk Rope&quot;) designed to add BO2k dropper capability to self-propagating malware; and the fact that it has actually widely been used for malicious purposes. The most common criticism is that BO2k installs and operates silently, without warning a logged-on user that remote administration or surveillance is taking place. According to the official BO2k documentation, the person running the BO2k server is not supposed to know that it is running on their computer.

BO2k developers counter these concerns in their &quot;Note on Product Legitimacy and Security&quot;, pointing out—among other things—that some remote administration tools widely recognized as legitimate also have options for silent installation and operation.

<doc id="145141" wikidata="Q1629626" url="?curid=145141" title="Woburn Abbey">
<text>Woburn Abbey (), occupying the east of the village of Woburn, Bedfordshire, England, is a country house, the family seat of the Duke of Bedford. Although it is still a family home to the current duke, it is open on specified days to visitors, along with the diverse estate surrounding it, including the historic landscape gardens and deer park (by Humphry Repton), as well as more recently added attractions including Woburn Safari Park, a miniature railway and a garden/visitor centre. It was built by William Russell, 1st Baron Russell of Thornhaugh.

== Pre-20th century ==
=== Monastic origins ===
Woburn Abbey, comprising Woburn Park and its buildings, was set out and founded as a Cistercian abbey in 1145.
The Cistercian community was dissolved by Henry VIII in 1538.

=== Early Russell family rebuilding projects ===
In 1547 the estate became the seat of the Russell family and the Dukes of Bedford, Around 1630, Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford undertook the first rebuilding, demolishing or incorporating original abbey building and built the manor house on the monastic site, although the name &quot;Abbey&quot; was retained.

=== Eighteenth Century ===
The second rebuilding occurred under architects Henry Flitcroft and John Sanderson between 1747 and 1761.

In April 1786 John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, both future Presidents of the United States, visited Woburn Abbey and other notable houses in the area. After visiting them Adams wrote in his diary &quot;Stowe, Hagley, and Blenheim, are superb; Woburn, Caversham, and the Leasowes are beautiful. Wotton is both great and elegant, though neglected&quot;. However he was also damning about the means used to finance the large estates, and he did not think that the embellishments to the landscape made by the owners of the great country houses would suit the more rugged American countryside.

Further rework undertaken between 1787 and 1790 was directed by Henry Holland.

== Second World War ==
Visiting Woburn Abbey in March 1939, the MP and diarist Henry Channon described the well-kept-up &quot;feudal magnificance&quot; of the estate shortly before the outbreak of war. This included more than twenty drawing rooms, thirty cars and whole rooms devoted each to collections of Joshua Reynolds, Canalettos and Van Dyck paintings.

From 1941 Woburn Abbey was the headquarters of the secretive Political Warfare Executive (PWE) which had its London offices at the BBC&#x27;s Bush House.

== 1945 to 1970s ==

Following World War II, dry rot was discovered and half the Abbey was subsequently demolished. When the 12th Duke died in 1953, his son the 13th Duke was exposed to death duties of $14 million and the Abbey was a half-demolished, half-derelict house. Instead of handing the family estates over to the National Trust, he kept ownership and opened the Abbey to the public for the first time in 1955. It soon gained in popularity and in its first ten years, it had ticket sales of $11 million, helping to pay off much of the death duties. Other amusements were added, including Woburn Safari Park on the grounds of the Abbey in 1970. Asked about the unfavourable comments by other aristocrats when he turned the family home into a safari park, the 13th Duke said, &quot;I do not relish the scorn of the peerage, but it is better to be looked down on than overlooked.&quot;

== 1970s to present ==
The 13th Duke moved to Monte Carlo in 1975. His son Robin, who enjoyed the courtesy title Marquess of Tavistock, ran the Abbey with his wife in his father&#x27;s absence. In the early 1990s, the Marquess and The Tussauds Group planned to turn the Abbey into a large theme park with the help of John Wardley, creator of the roller coasters &quot;Nemesis&quot; and &quot;Oblivion&quot;. However, Tussauds bought Alton Towers and built one there instead. From 1999 to 2002, the Marquess and the Marchioness, the former Henrietta Joan Tiarks, were the subjects of the Tiger Aspect Productions reality series &quot;Country House&quot; in three series, totalling 29 episodes, which aired on BBC Two. It detailed the daily life and the business of running the Abbey. The Marquess of Tavistock became the 14th Duke on the death of his father in November 2002 in Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States. The 14th Duke was the briefest holder of the Dukedom and died in June 2003. On the death of the 14th Duke, his son Andrew became the 15th Duke, and he continues his father&#x27;s work in running the Woburn Abbey Estate. The building is a Grade I listed building.

== Collection ==
The art collection of the Duke of Bedford is extensive and encompasses a wide range of western artwork. The holdings comprise some 250 paintings, including works by Rubens, Van Dyck, Canaletto and Velasquez. Moreover, the collection encompasses examples of the finest manufacturers of furniture, French and English in many periods, and a diverse collection of porcelain and silverware.

<doc id="145143" wikidata="Q2791993" url="?curid=145143" title="Legion of Doom">
<text>The Legion of Doom is a group of supervillains who originated in &quot;Challenge of the Superfriends&quot;, an animated series from Hanna-Barbera based on DC Comics&#x27; Justice League. The Legion of Doom has since been incorporated into the main DC Universe, appearing in comics, as well as further animated and live-action adaptations, and also video games.

==History==
In each episode of &quot;Challenge of the Superfriends&quot; that they appeared, the Legion of Doom would enact a plot against the Super Friends and a plot to take over the world only to be met with defeat by the end of the story. In some episodes, they would escape capture through a last-minute escape plan often contrived by Luthor. Other times, the Legion of Doom (or portions of it) would end up apprehended.

The episode &quot;History of Doom&quot; showed that Lex Luthor assembled 12 supervillains in order to form the most powerful and sinister group the world had ever seen.

==Development==
When the &quot;Challenge of the Superfriends&quot; season was originally conceived, it was named &quot;Battle of the Superheroes&quot; and featured the introduction of Captain Marvel to the Super Friends. The group that challenged the heroes was to be called the &quot;League of Evil&quot;, led by Captain Marvel&#x27;s nemesis Doctor Sivana. However, Filmation was producing &quot;Shazam!&quot; and &quot;The New Adventures of Batman&quot; which prevented the use of characters such as Mister Atom, King Kull, Beautia Sivana, Joker, Penguin, Mr. Freeze, and Catwoman. Early conceptual art drawn by Alex Toth also included Heat Wave, Poison Ivy, and Abra Kadabra.

==The Hall of Doom==
The Legion of Doom&#x27;s headquarters was the Hall of Doom which was located in Slaughter Swamp (just outside Gotham City). The facility, which resembles Black Manta&#x27;s helmet, could be lowered or raised above the swamp water&#x27;s surface. It could fly or enter space using rockets. The Hall of Doom&#x27;s mobility could be controlled through remote control helping the Legion to escape on several occasions. Its defenses included laser weapons and the ability to time travel.

In &quot;Doomsday&quot; after Sinestro, Black Manta and Cheetah are abandoned by the rest of the Legion after they take control of a mental device, they use it to create another Hall of Doom, which attacks the original one and enables the Legion to be captured.

In &quot;History of Doom&quot;, the Hall is shown being constructed in a barn just after the Legion formed. Black Manta proposes that they have it in the ocean, Captain Cold proposes to have it underneath the polar ice caps, and Gorilla Grodd proposes that they have it in the jungle. As a compromise, Lex Luthor decides to have it within the waters of Slaughter Swamp as it is flown to that location.

==Members==
There were thirteen members of the Legion of Doom:

* Despite the opening sequence for &quot;Challenge of the Superfriends&quot; claiming that the Legion&#x27;s members had &quot;banded together from remote galaxies&quot;, ten out of the thirteen are native to Earth; only Brainiac (from Colu), Bizarro (from Bizarro World), and Sinestro (from Korugar) are extraterrestrials.
* The episode &quot;Super Friends: Rest In Peace&quot; makes a reference to a former unseen member of the Legion of Doom, the only time such a reference has been made. This was Doctor Natas, the inventor of the Noxium crystal that had the power to destroy all of the Super Friends like mimicking Kryptonite for Superman and mimicking a yellow energy for Green Lantern. The Super Friends knew of this crystal and tricked the Legion of Doom into thinking that it had killed all of them using android doubles of the Super Friends while the real ones hid in their space station. They anticipated that the Legion of Doom would throw away the crystal when they no longer needed it. The crystal was retrieved by Apache Chief in a hazmat suit and launched into deep space. It was not explained what happened to Doctor Natas.
* Prior to the first televised appearance of the Legion of Doom, a group called the Super Foes appeared in the first issue of the &quot;Super Friends&quot; comic book (Nov 1976). Its membership featured Toyman, Penguin, Poison Ivy, Cheetah, Human Flying Fish, and their protégés Toyboy, Chick, Honeysuckle, Kitten and Sardine, respectively, in keeping with the theme of trainees ala Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog.

==Other Legion episodes==
While &quot;Challenge of the Superfriends&quot; was the series spotlighting the Legion of Doom, they appear in a few &quot;Super Friends&quot; shorts:
* &quot;The Krypton Syndrome&quot;: After Superman saves Krypton in the past, he returns to an alternate present. Robin mentions that the Super Friends were defeated by the Legion of Doom.
* &quot;Two Gleeks are Deadlier Than One&quot;: Though only Giganta and Gorilla Grodd appear, the Legion of Doom is mentioned where the Super Friends investigate rumors that the Legion of Doom are getting back together. Like in &quot;Super Friends: Rest in Peace&quot;, the Super Friends used androids to trick Giganta and Gorilla Grodd into thinking they were destroyed.
* &quot;The Revenge of Doom&quot; (&quot;Super Friends&quot; short): All 13 members of the Legion of Doom appear after getting back together, but only Lex Luthor, Sinestro and Solomon Grundy have dialogue. In this appearance, they salvaged the Hall of Doom disguised as construction workers with the cover-up that they were going to turn it into a museum. Batman and Robin came upon the &quot;construction workers&quot; and demanded to see their permit, which they did, having been obtained by the Department of Parks. When there was a mentioning that the Ion Engines were removed by the Super Friends which would&#x27;ve made it the first flying museum, the Dynamic Duo gets suspicious about the construction workers learning about the top secret operation as the lead construction worker claims that the info of that might&#x27;ve been leaked to the news. With the plot exposed, Lex Luthor and the Legion of Doom shed their disguises and capture Batman and Robin. After refurbishing the Hall of Doom and equipping it with new weapons, they have developed a crystallizing ray to immobilize Superman and Wonder Woman. Batman and Robin eventually escape, reverse the effects of the crystallizing ray on Superman and Wonder Woman, and apprehend the Legion of Doom.

Members of the team have solo appearances in later episodes.

==Appearances in comics==
Members of the Legion of Doom made some appearances in the &quot;Super Friends&quot; spin-off comic title based on the TV series:
* A version of the Legion of Doom appeared in &quot;Extreme Justice&quot; #16–18 (May–July 1996), led by Brainwave Jr., during a time when he had become a villain. The other members were Killer Frost, Houngan, Major Force, the Madmen, and a robot duplicate of Gorilla Grodd.
* The 2006 DC comic miniseries &quot;Justice&quot; features a version of the Legion of Doom. Series plotter/artist Alex Ross is a passionate &quot;Super Friends&quot; fan.

* The headquarters of the Justice League in the future of the &quot;Sorcerer Kings&quot; arc in &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; is the Hall of Doom.
* An alternate version of the team appeared in the mini-series &quot;Flashpoint: Legion of Doom&quot;, part of the company-wide &quot;Flashpoint&quot; event.

* In the miniseries &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, the &quot;Gulag&quot; built by Mister Miracle to imprison the younger, more violent heroes bears a strong resemblance to the Hall of Doom.

The group consists of Lex Luthor, Sinestro, Cheetah, Gorilla Grodd, Brainiac, and Turtle. Former members include Black Manta and Joker, both excommunicated due to their own ulterior motives. Following the advice of The Batman Who Laughs, the Legion had destroyed the Source Wall and uncover the most powerful galactic being of the Sixth Dimension named Perpetua who is the mother of Monitor, Anti-Monitor, and World Forger.

* In &quot;The Flash&quot; #770-771, Wally West traveled to the Super Friends universe where he inhabited the body of the Reverse-Flash as he was being inducted into the Legion of Doom.
* In the series &quot;Harley Quinn: The Animated Series - Legion of Bats!&quot;, Poison Ivy accepted Lex Luthor&#x27;s offer to lead the Legion of Doom and chose to reinvent the group as the Ladies Of Doom (later Ladies And Nonbinaries Of Doom). This team included Knockout, Livewire, Nightfall, Porcelain, and Queen Bee. By series end, all but Porcelain and Queen Bee resigned. 
*In &quot;Justice League vs. Godzilla vs. Kong&quot; the Legion of Doom was transported to the Monsterverse where Toyman used the Dreamstone transport and weaponize Godzilla, Kong, and various other Titans back into their universe against the Justice League. Member Lex Luthor would meanwhile use schematics while in the Monsterverse to rebuild Mechagodzilla to do his bidding and tame the Titans to use against the Justice League. After the end of the fight all of the members were taken in while Toyman was killed by Godzilla in one of his rampages and Mechagodzilla was destroyed by the Justice League.

==In other media==
===Television===
* The Legion of Doom appears in &quot;Legends of the Superheroes&quot;, led by Mordru and consisting of Doctor Sivana, Riddler, Giganta, Sinestro, Weather Wizard, and Solomon Grundy.
* While never directly referred to as such in &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, with only the DVD box set for the third season explicitly doing so, the Legion of Doom served as inspiration for the Secret Society, which is originally led by Gorilla Grodd before Lex Luthor takes over and also includes Bizarro, Devil Ray, Cheetah, Giganta, Sinestro, and Toyman among their ranks. Series producer Bruce Timm said that he wanted to include the Riddler and Scarecrow as members as a nod to the original Legion, but could not do so due to the &quot;&quot;, which limited the use of Batman-related characters at the time. By the end of the series, Luthor, Bizarro, Cheetah, Giganta, Toyman, and Sinestro, among others, survive an attack by Darkseid before joining forces with the Justice League to foil his invasion of Earth. Ultimately, Luthor disappears with Darkseid after finding the Anti-Life Equation while the other survivors are given a &quot;five-minute head start&quot; in return. Of this final appearance, series writer Matt Wayne stated that he consciously tried to round up as many of the original thirteen Legionnaires as he could, citing the Legion&#x27;s Wikipedia page as one source.

This version of the group received their name from Legends member Nate Heywood after a cartoon he enjoyed as a child and seek the Spear of Destiny to alter their fates. Despite succeeding, they are betrayed by Heat Wave and defeated by the Legends, who allow the Black Flash to erase the Reverse-Flash from existence before returning the other Legionnaires to the points in time that Thawne pulled them from with no memory of their time with the Legion.

Additionally, Doctor Psycho was originally a member before he was ousted from the group for calling Wonder Woman and Giganta the &quot;C word&quot; on live television, which led to him siding with Harley Quinn, who seeks to join the Legion throughout the first season. This version of the group is based in Gotham and is described as a supportive community of elite supervillains dedicated to making the world a horrible place, having been behind some of the most evil plots in the 21st century. In the episode &quot;The Horse and the Sparrow&quot;, Luthor approaches Poison Ivy with an offer to lead the Legion in exchange for eliminating the Joker. Despite failing the mission, she agrees, recruiting Nora Fries as her assistant, King Shark as the head of the IT department, Jim Gordon as a security guard, and Frank the Plant as well.

<text>Ukrainians (, ) are an East Slavic ethnic group native to Ukraine. Their native tongue is Ukrainian, and the majority adhere to the Eastern Orthodox Church. By total population, the Ukrainians form the second-largest Slavic ethnic group after the Russians. 

Historically, under rule from various realms, the Ukrainians have been given various names by their rulers. Some of the states that have governed over the Ukrainian people include the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Habsburg monarchy, the Austrian Empire, and then Austria-Hungary. The East Slavic population inhabiting the territories of modern-day Ukraine were known as Ruthenians, referring to the territory of Ruthenia; the Ukrainians living under the Russian Empire were known as Little Russians, named after the territory of Little Russia. 

The ethnonym Ukrainian (a term associated with the Cossack Hetmanate) was adopted following the Ukrainian national revival. Their affinity with the Cossacks is frequently emphasized, for example, in the Ukrainian national anthem. Citizens of Ukraine are also called Ukrainians regardless of their ethnic origin, and Ukrainian nationals identify themselves as a civic nation.

==Ethnonym==

The modern name &quot;Ukraintsi&quot; (Ukrainians) is derived from &quot;Ukraina&quot; (Ukraine), a name first documented in the &quot;Kievan Chronicle&quot; under the year 1187. The terms &quot;Ukrainiany&quot; (first recorded in the &quot;Galician–Volhynian Chronicle&quot; under the year 1268), &quot;Ukrainnyky&quot;, and even &quot;narod ukrainskyi&quot; (the Ukrainian people) were used sporadically before &quot;Ukraintsi&quot; attained currency under the influence of the writings of Ukrainian activists in Russian-ruled Ukraine in the 19th century. From the 14th to the 16th centuries the western portions of the European part of what is now known as Russia, plus the territories of northern Ukraine and Belarus (Ruthenia) were largely known as &quot;Rus&quot;, continuing the tradition of Kievan Rus&#x27;. People of these territories were usually called &quot;Rus&quot; or &quot;Rusyns&quot; (known as Ruthenians in Western and Central Europe).

The Ukrainian language is, like modern Russian and Belarusian, a descendent of Old East Slavic. In Western and Central Europe it was known by the exonym &quot;Ruthenian&quot;. In the 16th and 17th centuries, with the establishment of the Zaporozhian Sich, names of Ukraine and Ukrainian began to be used in Sloboda Ukraine. After the decline of the Zaporozhian Sich and the establishment of Imperial Russian hegemony in Left Bank Ukraine, Ukrainians became more widely known by Russians as &quot;Little Russians&quot;, with the majority of Ukrainian élites espousing Little Russian identity and adopting the Russian language (as Ukrainian was outlawed in almost all contexts).&lt;ref name=&quot;http://litopys.org.ua&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This exonym (regarded now as a humiliating imperialist imposition) did not spread widely among the peasantry which constituted the majority of the population. Ukrainian peasants still referred to their country as &quot;Ukraine&quot; (a name associated with the Zaporozhian Sich, with the Hetmanate and with their struggle against Poles, Russians, Turks and Crimean Tatars) and to themselves and their language as Ruthenians/Ruthenian.

With the publication of Ivan Kotliarevsky&#x27;s &quot;Eneyida&quot; (Aeneid) in 1798, which established the modern Ukrainian language, and with the subsequent Romantic revival of national traditions and culture, the ethnonym &quot;Ukrainians&quot; and the notion of a Ukrainian language came into more prominence at the beginning of the 19th century and gradually replaced the words &quot;Rusyns&quot; and &quot;Ruthenian(s)&quot;. In areas outside the control of the Russian/Soviet state until the mid-20th century (Western Ukraine), Ukrainians were known by their pre-existing names for much longer. The appellation &quot;Ukrainians&quot; initially came into common usage in Central Ukraine and did not take hold in Galicia and Bukovina until the latter part of the 19th century, in Transcarpathia until the 1930s, and in the Prešov Region until the late 1940s.

The modern name &quot;Ukraintsi&quot; (Ukrainians) derives from &quot;Ukraina&quot; (Ukraine), a name first documented in 1187. Several scientific theories attempt to explain the etymology of the term. According to the traditional theory, it derives from the Proto-Slavic root *kraj-, which has two meanings, one meaning the homeland as in &quot;nash rodnoi kraj&quot; (our homeland), and the other &quot;edge, border&quot;, and originally had the sense of &quot;periphery&quot;, &quot;borderland&quot; or &quot;frontier region&quot;. According to another theory, the term &quot;ukraina&quot; should be distinguished from the term &quot;okraina&quot;: whereas the latter term means &quot;borderland&quot;, the former one has the meaning of &quot;cut-off piece of land&quot;, thus acquiring the connotation of &quot;our land&quot;, &quot;land allotted to us&quot;.

In the last three centuries the population of Ukraine experienced periods of Polonization and Russification, but preserved a common culture and a sense of common identity.

==Geographic distribution==

Most ethnic Ukrainians live in Ukraine, where they make up over three-quarters of the population. The largest population of Ukrainians outside of Ukraine lives in Russia where about 1.9 million Russian citizens identify as Ukrainian, while millions of others (primarily in southern Russia and Siberia) have some Ukrainian ancestry. The inhabitants of the Kuban, for example, have vacillated among three identities: Ukrainian, Russian (an identity supported by the Soviet regime), and &quot;Cossack&quot;. Approximately 800,000 people of Ukrainian ancestry live in the Russian Far East in an area known historically as &quot;Green Ukraine&quot;.

In a 2011 national poll of Ukraine, 49% of Ukrainians said they had relatives living in Russia.

According to some previous assumptions, an estimated number of almost 2.4 million people of Ukrainian origin live in North America (1,359,655 in Canada and 1,028,492 in the United States). Large numbers of Ukrainians live in Brazil (600,000), Kazakhstan (338,022), Moldova (325,235), Argentina (305,000), (Germany) (272,000), Italy (234,354), Belarus (225,734), Uzbekistan (124,602), the Czech Republic (110,245), Spain (90,530–100,000) and Romania (51,703–200,000). There are also large Ukrainian communities in such countries as Latvia, Portugal, France, Australia, Paraguay, the UK, Israel, Slovakia, Kyrgyzstan, Austria, Uruguay and the former Yugoslavia. Generally, the Ukrainian diaspora is present in more than one hundred and twenty countries of the world.

The number of Ukrainians in Poland amounted to some 51,000 people in 2011 (according to the Polish Census). Since 2014, the country has experienced a large increase in immigration from Ukraine. More recent data put the number of Ukrainian migrant workers at 1.2 – 1.3 million in 2016.

In the last decades of the 19th century, many Ukrainians were forced by the Tsarist autocracy to move to the Asian regions of Russia, while many of their counterpart Slavs under Austro-Hungarian rule emigrated to the New World seeking work and better economic opportunities. Today, large ethnic Ukrainian minorities reside in Russia, Canada, the United States, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Italy and Argentina. According to some sources, around 20 million people outside Ukraine identify as having Ukrainian ethnicity, however the official data of the respective countries calculated together does not show more than 10 million. Ukrainians have one of the largest diasporas in the world.

==Origin==

The East Slavs emerged from the undifferentiated early Slavs in the Slavic migrations of the 6th and 7th centuries CE. The state of Kievan Rus united the East Slavs during the 9th to 13th centuries. East Slavic tribes cited as &quot;proto-Ukrainian&quot; include the Volhynians, Derevlianians, Polianians, and Siverianians and the less significant Ulychians, Tivertsians, and White Croats.
The Gothic historian Jordanes and 6th-century Byzantine authors named two groups that lived in the south-east of Europe: &quot;Sclavins&quot; (western Slavs) and Antes. Polianians are identified as the founders of the city of Kiev and as playing the key role in the formation of the Kievan Rus&#x27; state. At the beginning of the 9th century, Varangians used the waterways of Eastern Europe for military raids and trade, particularly the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks. Until the 11th century these Varangians also served as key mercenary troops for a number of princes in medieval Kiev, as well as for some of the Byzantine emperors, while others occupied key administrative positions in Kievan Rus&#x27; society, and eventually became slavicized. Besides other cultural traces, several Ukrainian names show traces of Norse origins as a result of influences from that period.

Differentiation between separate East Slavic groups began to emerge in the later medieval period, and an East Slavic dialect continuum developed within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, with the Ruthenian language emerging as a written standard. The active development of a concept of a Ukrainian nation and the Ukrainian language began with the Ukrainian National Revival in the early 19th century in times when Ruthenians (Русини) changed their name due to the region name. In the Soviet era (1917–1991), official historiography emphasized &quot;the cultural unity of &#x27;proto-Ukrainians&#x27; and &#x27;proto-Russians&#x27; in the fifth and sixth centuries&quot;.

A poll conducted in April 2022 by &quot;Rating&quot; found that the vast majority (91%) of Ukrainians (excluding the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine) do not support the thesis that &quot;Russians and Ukrainians are one people&quot;.

===Genetics and genomics===
Ukrainians, like most Europeans, largely descend from three distinct lineages: Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, descended from populations associated with the Paleolithic Epigravettian culture; Neolithic Early European Farmers who migrated from Anatolia during the Neolithic Revolution 9,000 years ago; and Yamnaya Steppe pastoralists who expanded into Europe from the Pontic–Caspian steppe of Ukraine and southern Russia in the context of Indo-European migrations 5,000 years ago.

In a survey of 97 genomes for diversity in full genome sequences among self-identified Ukrainians from Ukraine, a study identified more than 13 million genetic variants, representing about a quarter of the total genetic diversity discovered in Europe. Among these nearly 500,000 are previously undocumented and likely to be unique for this population. Medically relevant mutations whose prevalence in the Ukrainian genomes differed significantly compared to other European genome sequences, particularly from Western Europe and Russia. Ukrainian genomes form a single cluster positioned between the Northern on one side, and Western European populations on the other. There was a significant overlap with Central European populations as well as with people from the Balkans. In addition to the close geographic distance between these populations, this may also reflect the insufficient representation of samples from the surrounding populations.

The Ukrainian gene-pool includes the following Y-haplogroups, in order from the most prevalent:

* R1a (43%)
* I2a (23%)
* R1b (8%)
* E1b1b (7%)
* I1 (5%)
* N1 (5%)
* J2 (4%)
* G (3%)
* T (1%)

Roughly all R1a Ukrainians carry R1a-Z282; R1a-Z282 has been found significantly only in Eastern Europe. Chernivtsi Oblast is the only region in Ukraine where Haplogroup I2a occurs more frequently than R1a, much less frequent even in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. In comparison to their northern and eastern neighbors, Ukrainians have a similar percentage of Haplogroup R1a-Z280 (43%) in their population—compare Belarusians, Russians, and Lithuanians and (55%, 46%, and 42% respectively). Populations in Eastern Europe which have never been Slavic do as well. Ukrainians in Chernivtsi Oblast (near the Romanian border) have a higher percentage of I2a as opposed to R1a, which is typical of the Balkan region, but a smaller percentage than Russians of the N1c1 lineage found among Finno-Ugric, Baltic, and Siberian populations, and also less R1b than West Slavs.
In terms of haplogroup distribution, the genetic pattern of Ukrainians most closely resembles that of Belarusians. The presence of the N1c lineage is explained by a contribution of the assimilated Finno-Ugric tribes.

==Related ethnic groups==
Within Ukraine and adjacent areas, there are several other distinct ethnic sub-groups, especially in western Ukraine: places like Zakarpattia and Halychyna. Among them the most known are Hutsuls, Volhynians, Boykos and Lemkos (otherwise known as Carpatho-Rusyns – a derivative of &quot;Carpathian Ruthenians&quot;), each with particular areas of settlement, dialect, dress, and folk traditions.

==History==
===Early history===
Ukraine has had a very turbulent history, a fact explained by its geographical position. In the 9th century the Varangians from Scandinavia conquered the proto-Slavic tribes on the territory of today&#x27;s Ukraine, Belarus, and western Russia and laid the groundwork for the Kievan Rus&#x27; state. The ancestors of the Ukrainian nation such as Polianians had an important role in the development and culturalization of Kievan Rus&#x27; state. The internecine wars between Rus&#x27; princes, which began after the death of Yaroslav the Wise, led to the political fragmentation of the state into a number of principalities. The quarreling between the princes left Kievan Rus&#x27; vulnerable to foreign attacks, and the invasion of the Mongols in 1236. and 1240. finally destroyed the state. Another important state in the history of the Ukrainians is the Kingdom of Ruthenia (1199–1349).

The third important state for Ukrainians is the Cossack Hetmanate. The Cossacks of Zaporizhzhia since the late 15th century controlled the lower bends of the river Dnieper, between Russia, Poland and the Tatars of Crimea, with the fortified capital, Zaporozhian Sich. Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky is one of the most celebrated and at the same time most controversial political figures in Ukraine&#x27;s early-modern history. A brilliant military leader, his greatest achievement in the process of national revolution was the formation of the Cossack Hetmanate state of the Zaporozhian Host (1648–1782). The period of the Ruin in the late 17th century in the history of Ukraine is characterized by the disintegration of Ukrainian statehood and general decline. During the Ruin Ukraine became divided along the Dnieper River into Left-Bank Ukraine and Right-Bank Ukraine, and the two-halves became hostile to each other. Ukrainian leaders during the period are considered to have been largely opportunists and men of little vision who could not muster broad popular support for their policies. There were roughly 4 million Ukrainians at the end of the 17th century.

At the final stages of the First World War, a powerful struggle for an independent Ukrainian state developed in the central Ukrainian territories, which, until 1917, were part of the Russian Empire. The newly established Ukrainian government, the Central Rada, headed by Mykhailo Hrushevsky, issued four universals, the Fourth of which, dated 22 January 1918, declared the independence and sovereignty of the Ukrainian National Republic (UNR) on 25 January 1918. The session of the Central Rada on 29 April 1918 ratified the Constitution of the UNR and elected Hrushevsky president.

===Soviet period===
During the 1920s, under the Ukrainisation policy pursued by the national Communist leadership of Mykola Skrypnyk, Soviet leadership encouraged a national renaissance in the Ukrainian culture and language. Ukrainisation was part of the Soviet-wide policy of Korenisation (literally indigenisation).

During 1932–1933, millions of Ukrainians were starved to death by the Soviet regime which led to a famine, known as the Holodomor. The Soviet regime remained silent about the Holodomor and provided no aid to the victims or the survivors. But news and information about what was going on reached the West and evoked public responses in Polish-ruled Western Ukraine and in the Ukrainian diaspora. Since the 1990s the independent Ukrainian state, particularly under President Viktor Yushchenko, the Ukrainian mass media and academic institutions, many foreign governments, most Ukrainian scholars, and many foreign scholars have viewed and written about the Holodomor as genocide and issued official declarations and publications to that effect. Modern scholarly estimates of the direct loss of human life due to the famine range between 2.6 million (3–3.5 million) and 12 million although much higher numbers are usually published in the media and cited in political debates. As of March 2008, the parliament of Ukraine and the governments of several countries, including the United States have recognized the Holodomor as an act of genocide.

Following the Invasion of Poland in September 1939, German and Soviet troops divided the territory of Poland. Thus, Eastern Galicia and Volhynia with their Ukrainian population became part of Soviet Ukraine. When the German armies invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, those regions temporarily became part of the Nazi-controlled Reichskommissariat Ukraine. In total, the number of ethnic Ukrainians who fought in the ranks of the Soviet Army is estimated from 4.5 million to 7 million. The pro-Soviet partisan guerrilla resistance in Ukraine is estimated to number at 47,800 from the start of occupation to 500,000 at its peak in 1944, with about 50% being ethnic Ukrainians. Of the estimated 8.6 million Soviet troop losses, 1.4 million were ethnic Ukrainians.

In 1943, under the command of Roman Shukhevych, UPA began the ethnic cleansing. Shukhevych was one of the perpetrators of the Galicia-Volhynia massacres of tens of thousands of Polish civilians. It is unclear to what extent Shuchevych was responsible for the massacres of Poles in Volhynia, but he certainly condoned them after some time, and also directed the massacres of Poles in Eastern Galicia. Historian Per Anders Rudling has accused the Ukrainian diaspora and Ukrainian academics of &quot;ignoring, glossing over, or outright denying&quot; his role in this and other war crimes.

===Historical maps of Ukraine===
The Ukrainian state has occupied a number of territories since its initial foundation. Most of these territories have been located within Eastern Europe, however, as depicted in the maps in the gallery below, has also at times extended well into Eurasia and South-Eastern Europe. At times there has also been a distinct lack of a Ukrainian state, as its territories were on a number of occasions, annexed by its more powerful neighbours.
==Ethnic/national identity==
The watershed period in the development of modern Ukrainian national consciousness was the struggle for independence during the creation of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic from 1917 to 1921. A concerted effort to reverse the growth of Ukrainian national consciousness was begun by the regime of Joseph Stalin in the late 1920s, and continued with minor interruptions until the most recent times. The man-made Famine of 1932–33, the deportations of the so-called kulaks, the physical annihilation of the nationally conscious intelligentsia, and terror in general were used to destroy and subdue the Ukrainian nation. Even after Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death the concept of a Russified though multiethnic Soviet people was officially promoted, according to which the non-Russian nations were relegated to second-class status. Despite this, many Ukrainians played prominent roles in the Soviet Union, including such public figures as Semen Tymoshenko.

The creation of a sovereign and independent Ukraine in 1991, however, pointed to the failure of the policy of the &quot;merging of nations&quot; and to the enduring strength of the Ukrainian national consciousness. Today, one of the consequences of these acts is Ukrainophobia.

Biculturalism is especially present in southeastern Ukraine where there is a significant Russian minority. Historical colonization of Ukraine is one reason that creates confusion about national identity to this day. Many citizens of Ukraine have adopted the Ukrainian national identity in the past 20 years. According to the concept of nationality dominant in Eastern Europe the Ukrainians are people whose native language is Ukrainian (an objective criterion) whether or not they are nationally conscious, and all those who identify themselves as Ukrainian (a subjective criterion) whether or not they speak Ukrainian.

Attempts to introduce a territorial-political concept of Ukrainian nationality on the Western European model (presented by political philosopher Vyacheslav Lypynsky) were unsuccessful until the 1990s. Territorial loyalty has also been manifested by the historical national minorities living in Ukraine. The official declaration of Ukrainian sovereignty of 16 July 1990 stated that &quot;citizens of the Republic of all nationalities constitute the people of Ukraine.&quot;

==Culture==

Due to Ukraine&#x27;s geographical location, its culture primarily exhibits Eastern European influence as well as Central European to an extent (primarily in the western region). Over the years it has been influenced by movements such as those brought about during the Byzantine Empire and the Renaissance. Today, the country is somewhat culturally divided with the western regions bearing a stronger Central European influence and the eastern regions showing a significant Russian influence. A strong Christian culture was predominant for many centuries, although Ukraine was also the center of conflict between the Catholic, Orthodox and Islamic spheres of influence.

===Language===


Ukrainian (, &quot;ukraі́nska móva&quot;) is the sole official language in Ukraine. It belongs to the East Slavic branch of the Slavic languages. Written Ukrainian uses the Ukrainian alphabet, one of many based on the Cyrillic alphabet. The language is a lineal descendant of the colloquial Old East Slavic language of the medieval state of Kievan Rus&#x27;, which first split into Ruthenian and Russian. The Ruthenian languages then evolved into modern-day Ukrainian, Belarusian and Rusyn. In modern-day Ukraine, most of its population are also fluent in Russian and many use it as their native tongue.

Comparisons are often made between Ukrainian and Russian. Yet, there is more mutual intelligibility with Belarusian, and a very close lexical distance between the two. Historically, state-inforced Russification saw the Ukrainian language banned as a subject from schools and as a language of instruction in the Russian Empire. The oppression continued in various ways while Ukraine was a part of the Soviet Union. However, the language continued to be used throughout the country, especially in the western part.

===Religions===
Ukraine was inhabited by pagan tribes until Byzantine rite Christianity was introduced by the turn of the first millennium. It was imagined by later writers who sought to put Kievan Rus&#x27; Christianity on the same level of primacy as Byzantine Christianity that Apostle Andrew himself had visited the site where the city of Kiev would be later built.

However, it was only by the 10th century that the emerging state, the Kievan Rus&#x27;, became influenced by the Byzantine Empire; the first known conversion was by the Princess Saint Olga who came to Constantinople in 945 or 957. Several years later, her grandson, Prince Vladimir baptised his people in the Dnieper River. This began a long history of the dominance of the Eastern Orthodoxy in Ruthenia (Ukraine).

Ukrainians are majority Eastern Orthodox Christians, and they form the second largest ethno-linguistic group among Eastern Orthodox in the world. Ukrainians have their own autocephalous Orthodox Church of Ukraine headed by Metropolitan Epiphanius, where it is the most common church and in the small areas of Ukraine the Ukrainian Orthodox Church who were under the jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate is the smaller common. The Russian invasion of Ukraine impacted the religious identity of some Ukrainians. 

In the Western region known as Halychyna, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, one of the Eastern Rite Catholic Churches has a strong membership. Since the fall of the Soviet Union there has been a growth of Protestant churches (Baptists, Evangelism, Pentecostalism) There are also ethnic minorities that practice other religions, i.e. Crimean Tatars (Islam), and Jews and Karaim (Judaism). 

Also, some Ukrainians are members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

A 2020 survey conducted by the Razumkov Centre found that majority of Ukrainian populations was adhering to Christianity (81.9%). Of these Christians, 75.4% are Eastern Orthodox (34% of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and 13.8% of the Moscow Patriarchate, and 27.6% are simply Orthodox), 8.2% are Greek Catholics, 7.1% are simply Christians, a further 1.9% are Protestants and 0.4% are Latin Catholics. As of 2016, 16.3% of the population does not claim a religious affiliation, and 1.7% adheres to other religions. According to the same survey, 70% of the population of Ukraine declared to be believers, but do not belong to any church. 8.8% do not identify themselves with any of the denominations, and another 5.6% identified themselves as non-believers.

===Cuisine===
Ukrainian cuisine has been formed by the nation&#x27;s tumultuous history, geography, culture and social customs. Chicken is the most consumed type of protein, accounting for about half of the meat intake. It is followed by pork and beef. Vegetables such as potatoes, cabbages, mushrooms and beetroots are widely consumed. Pickled vegetables are considered a delicacy. Salo, which is cured pork fat, is considered the national delicacy. Widely used herbs include dill, parsley, basil, coriander and chives.

Ukraine is often called the &quot;Breadbasket of Europe&quot;, and its plentiful grain and cereal resources such as rye and wheat play an important part in its cuisine; essential in making various kinds of bread. Chernozem, the country&#x27;s black-colored highly fertile soil, produces some of the world&#x27;s most flavorful crops. 

Popular traditional dishes &#x27; (dumpling), &quot;nalysnyky&quot; (crêpe), &quot;kapusnyak&quot; (cabbage soup), &quot;nudli&quot; (dumpling stew), borscht (sour soup) and (cabbage roll). Among traditional baked goods are decorated korovai and paska (easter bread). Ukrainian specialties also include Chicken Kiev and Kyiv cake. Popular drinks include &quot;uzvar&quot; (kompot), &quot;ryazhanka&quot;, and &#x27;. Liquor (spirits) are the most consumed type of alcoholic beverage. Alcohol consumption has seen a stark decrease, though by per capita, it remains among the highest the world.

===Music===
Ukrainian music incorporates a diversity of external cultural influences. It also has a very strong indigenous Slavic and Christian uniqueness whose elements were used among many neighboring nations.

Ukrainian folk oral literature, poetry, and songs (such as the dumas) are among the most distinctive ethnocultural features of Ukrainians as a people. Religious music existed in Ukraine before the official adoption of Christianity, in the form of plainsong &quot;obychnyi spiv&quot; or &quot;musica practica&quot;. Traditional Ukrainian music is easily recognized by its somewhat melancholy tone. It first became known outside of Ukraine during the 15th century as musicians from Ukraine would perform before the royal courts in Poland (latter in Russia).

A large number of famous musicians around the world was educated or born in Ukraine, among them are famous names like Dmitry Bortniansky, Sergei Prokofiev, Myroslav Skoryk, etc. Ukraine is also the rarely acknowledged musical heartland of the former Russian Empire, home to its first professional music academy, which opened in the mid-18th century and produced numerous early musicians and composers.

===Dance===
Ukrainian dance refers to the traditional folk dances of the peoples of Ukraine. Today, Ukrainian dance is primarily represented by what ethnographers, folklorists and dance historians refer to as &quot;Ukrainian Folk-Stage Dances&quot;, which are stylized representations of traditional dances and their characteristic movements that have been choreographed for concert dance performances. This stylized art form has so permeated the culture of Ukraine, that very few purely traditional forms of Ukrainian dance remain today.

Ukrainian dance is often described as energetic, fast-paced, and entertaining, and along with traditional Easter eggs (&quot;pysanky&quot;), it is a characteristic example of Ukrainian culture recognized and appreciated throughout the world.

===Symbols===

Ukraine&#x27;s national symbols include its flag and its coat of arms.

The national flag of Ukraine is a blue and yellow bicolour rectangle. The colour fields are of same form and equal size. The colours of the flag represent a blue sky above yellow fields of wheat. The flag was designed for the convention of the Supreme Ruthenian Council, meeting in Lviv in October 1848. Its colours were based on the coat-of-arms of the Kingdom of Ruthenia.

The Coat of arms of Ukraine features the same colours found on the Ukrainian flag: a blue shield with yellow trident—the symbol of ancient East Slavic tribes that once lived in Ukraine, later adopted by Ruthenian and Kievan Rus rulers.
