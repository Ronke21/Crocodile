<text>Francis Jean Marcel Poulenc (; 7 January 189930 January 1963) was a French composer and pianist. His compositions include songs, solo piano works, chamber music, choral pieces, operas, ballets, and orchestral concert music. Among the best-known are the piano suite &quot;Trois mouvements perpétuels&quot; (1919), the ballet &quot;Les biches&quot; (1923), the &quot;Concert champêtre&quot; (1928) for harpsichord and orchestra, the Organ Concerto (1938), the opera &quot;Dialogues des Carmélites&quot; (1957), and the &quot;Gloria&quot; (1959) for soprano, choir, and orchestra.

As the only son of a prosperous manufacturer, Poulenc was expected to follow his father into the family firm, and he was not allowed to enrol at a music college. He studied with the pianist Ricardo Viñes, who became his mentor after the composer&#x27;s parents died. Poulenc also made the acquaintance of Erik Satie, under whose tutelage he became one of a group of young composers known collectively as &quot;Les Six&quot;. In his early works Poulenc became known for his high spirits and irreverence. During the 1930s a much more serious side to his nature emerged, particularly in the religious music he composed from 1936 onwards, which he alternated with his more light-hearted works.

In addition to his work as a composer, Poulenc was an accomplished pianist. He was particularly celebrated for his performing partnerships with the baritone Pierre Bernac (who also advised him in vocal writing) and the soprano Denise Duval. He toured in Europe and America with both of them, and made a number of recordings as a pianist. He was among the first composers to see the importance of the gramophone, and he recorded extensively from 1928 onwards.

In his later years, and for decades after his death, Poulenc had a reputation, particularly in his native country, as a humorous, lightweight composer, and his religious music was often overlooked. In the 21st century, more attention has been given to his serious works, with many new productions of &quot;Dialogues des Carmélites&quot; and &quot;La voix humaine&quot; worldwide, and numerous live and recorded performances of his songs and choral music.

==Life==
===Early years===

Poulenc was born in the 8th arrondissement of Paris on 7 January 1899, the younger child and only son of Émile Poulenc and his wife, Jenny, &quot;née&quot; Royer. Émile Poulenc was a joint owner of Poulenc Frères, a successful manufacturer of pharmaceuticals (later Rhône-Poulenc). He was a member of a pious Roman Catholic family from Espalion in the département of Aveyron. Jenny Poulenc was from a Parisian family with wide artistic interests. In Poulenc&#x27;s view, the two sides of his nature grew out of this background: a deep religious faith from his father&#x27;s family and a worldly and artistic side from his mother&#x27;s. The critic Claude Rostand later described Poulenc as &quot;half monk and half naughty boy&quot;.

Poulenc grew up in a musical household; his mother was a capable pianist, with a wide repertoire ranging from classical to less elevated works that gave him a lifelong taste for what he called &quot;adorable bad music&quot;. He took piano lessons from the age of five; when he was eight he first heard the music of Debussy and was fascinated by the originality of the sound. Other composers whose works influenced his development were Schubert and Stravinsky: the former&#x27;s &quot;Winterreise&quot; and the latter&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; made a deep impression on him. At his father&#x27;s insistence, Poulenc followed a conventional school career, studying at the Lycée Condorcet in Paris rather than at a music conservatory.

In 1916 a childhood friend, Raymonde Linossier (1897–1930), introduced Poulenc to Adrienne Monnier&#x27;s bookshop, the &quot;Maison des Amis des Livres&quot;. There he met the &quot;avant-garde&quot; poets Guillaume Apollinaire, Max Jacob, Paul Éluard and Louis Aragon. He later set many of their poems to music. In the same year he became the pupil of pianist Ricardo Viñes. The biographer Henri Hell comments that Viñes&#x27;s influence on his pupil was profound, both as to pianistic technique and the style of Poulenc&#x27;s keyboard works. Poulenc later said of Viñes:

He was a most delightful man, a bizarre hidalgo with enormous moustachios, a flat-brimmed sombrero in the purest Spanish style, and button boots which he used to rap my shins when I didn&#x27;t change the pedalling enough. ... I admired him madly, because, at this time, in 1914, he was the only virtuoso who played Debussy and Ravel. That meeting with Viñes was paramount in my life: I owe him everything ... In reality it is to Viñes that I owe my fledgling efforts in music and everything I know about the piano.

When Poulenc was sixteen his mother died; his father died two years later. Viñes became more than a teacher: he was, in the words of Myriam Chimènes in the &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, the young man&#x27;s &quot;spiritual mentor&quot;. He encouraged his pupil to compose, and he later gave the premieres of three early Poulenc works. Through him Poulenc became friendly with two composers who helped shape his early development: Georges Auric and Erik Satie.

Auric, who was the same age as Poulenc, was an early developer musically; by the time the two met, Auric&#x27;s music had already been performed at important Parisian concert venues. The two young composers shared a similar musical outlook and enthusiasms, and for the rest of Poulenc&#x27;s life Auric was his most trusted friend and guide. Poulenc called him &quot;my true brother in spirit&quot;. Satie, an eccentric figure, isolated from the mainstream French musical establishment, was a mentor to several rising young composers, including Auric, Louis Durey and Arthur Honegger. After initially dismissing Poulenc as a bourgeois amateur, he relented and admitted him to the circle of protégés, whom he called &quot;Les Nouveaux Jeunes&quot;. Poulenc described Satie&#x27;s influence on him as &quot;immediate and wide, on both the spiritual and musical planes&quot;. Pianist Alfred Cortot commented that Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Trois mouvements perpétuels&quot; were &quot;reflections of the ironical outlook of Satie adapted to the sensitive standards of the current intellectual circles&quot;.

===First compositions and &quot;Les Six&quot;===
Poulenc made his début as a composer in 1917 with his &quot;Rapsodie nègre&quot;, a ten-minute, five-movement piece for baritone and chamber group; it was dedicated to Satie and premiered at one of a series of concerts of new music run by the singer Jane Bathori. There was a fashion for African arts in Paris at the time, and Poulenc was delighted to run across some published verses, purportedly Liberian but full of Parisian boulevard slang. He used one of the poems in two sections of the rhapsody. The baritone engaged for the first performance lost his nerve on the platform, and the composer, though no singer, jumped in. This &quot;jeu d&#x27;esprit&quot; was the first of many examples of what Anglophone critics came to call &quot;leg-Poulenc&quot;. Ravel was amused by the piece and commented on Poulenc&#x27;s ability to invent his own folklore. Stravinsky was impressed enough to use his influence to secure Poulenc a contract with a publisher, a kindness that Poulenc never forgot.
In 1917 Poulenc got to know Ravel well enough to have serious discussions with him about music. He was dismayed by Ravel&#x27;s judgments, which exalted composers whom Poulenc thought little of above those he greatly admired. He told Satie of this unhappy encounter; Satie replied with a dismissive epithet for Ravel who, he said, talked &quot;a load of rubbish&quot;. For many years Poulenc was equivocal about Ravel&#x27;s music, though always respecting him as a man. Ravel&#x27;s modesty about his own music particularly appealed to Poulenc, who sought throughout his life to follow Ravel&#x27;s example.

From January 1918 to January 1921 Poulenc was a conscript in the French army in the last months of the First World War and the immediate post-war period. Between July and October 1918 he served at the Franco-German front, after which he was given a series of auxiliary posts, ending as a typist at the Ministry of Aviation. His duties allowed him time for composition; the &quot;Trois mouvements perpétuels&quot; for piano and the Sonata for Piano Duet were written at the piano of the local elementary school at Saint-Martin-sur-le-Pré, and he completed his first song cycle, &quot;Le bestiaire&quot;, setting poems by Apollinaire. The sonata did not create a deep public impression, but the song cycle made the composer&#x27;s name known in France, and the &quot;Trois mouvements perpétuels&quot; rapidly became an international success. The exigencies of music-making in wartime taught Poulenc much about writing for whatever instruments were available; then, and later, some of his works were for unusual combinations of players.

At this stage in his career Poulenc was conscious of his lack of academic musical training; the critic and biographer Jeremy Sams writes that it was the composer&#x27;s good luck that the public mood was turning against late-romantic lushness in favour of the &quot;freshness and insouciant charm&quot; of his works, technically unsophisticated though they were. Four of Poulenc&#x27;s early works were premiered at the Salle Huyghens in the Montparnasse area, where between 1917 and 1920 the cellist Félix Delgrange presented concerts of music by young composers. Among them were Auric, Durey, Honegger, Darius Milhaud and Germaine Tailleferre who, with Poulenc, became known collectively as &quot;Les Six&quot;. After one of their concerts, the critic Henri Collet published an article titled, &quot;The Five Russians, the Six Frenchmen and Satie&quot;. According to Milhaud:
In completely arbitrary fashion Collet chose the names of six composers, Auric, Durey, Honegger, Poulenc, Tailleferre and myself, for no other reason than that we knew each other, that we were friends and were represented in the same programmes, but without the slightest concern for our different attitudes and our different natures. Auric and Poulenc followed the ideas of Cocteau, Honegger was a product of German Romanticism and my leanings were towards a Mediterranean lyrical art ... Collet&#x27;s article made such a wide impression that the Groupe des Six had come into being.
Cocteau, though similar in age to &quot;Les Six&quot;, was something of a father-figure to the group. His literary style, &quot;paradoxical and lapidary&quot; in Hell&#x27;s phrase, was anti-romantic, concise and irreverent. It greatly appealed to Poulenc, who made his first setting of Cocteau&#x27;s words in 1919 and his last in 1961. When members of &quot;Les Six&quot; collaborated with each other, they contributed their own individual sections to the joint work. Their 1920 piano suite &quot;L&#x27;Album des Six&quot; consists of six separate and unrelated pieces. Their 1921 ballet &quot;Les mariés de la tour Eiffel&quot; contains three sections by Milhaud, two apiece by Auric, Poulenc and Tailleferre, one by Honegger and none by Durey, who was already distancing himself from the group.

In the early 1920s Poulenc remained concerned at his lack of formal musical training. Satie was suspicious of music colleges, but Ravel advised Poulenc to take composition lessons; Milhaud suggested the composer and teacher Charles Koechlin. Poulenc worked with him intermittently from 1921 to 1925.

===1920s: increasing fame===
From the early 1920s Poulenc was well received abroad, particularly in Britain, both as a performer and a composer. In 1921 Ernest Newman wrote in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, &quot;I keep my eye on Francis Poulenc, a young man who has only just arrived at his twenties. He ought to develop into a farceur of the first order.&quot; Newman said that he had rarely heard anything so deliciously absurd as parts of Poulenc&#x27;s song cycle &quot;Cocardes&quot;, with its accompaniment played by the unorthodox combination of cornet, trombone, violin and percussion. In 1922 Poulenc and Milhaud travelled to Vienna to meet Alban Berg, Anton Webern and Arnold Schoenberg. Neither of the French composers was influenced by their Austrian colleagues&#x27; revolutionary twelve-tone system, but they admired the three as its leading proponents. The following year Poulenc received a commission from Sergei Diaghilev for a full-length ballet score. He decided that the theme would be a modern version of the classical French &quot;fête galante&quot;. This work, &quot;Les biches&quot;, was an immediate success, first in Monte Carlo in January 1924 and then in Paris in May, under the direction of André Messager; it has remained one of Poulenc&#x27;s best-known scores. Poulenc&#x27;s new celebrity after the success of the ballet was the unexpected cause of his estrangement from Satie: among the new friends Poulenc made was Louis Laloy, a writer whom Satie regarded with implacable enmity. Auric, who had just enjoyed a similar triumph with a Diaghilev ballet, &quot;Les Fâcheux&quot;, was also repudiated by Satie for becoming a friend of Laloy.
As the decade progressed, Poulenc produced a range of compositions, from songs to chamber music and another ballet, &quot;Aubade&quot;. Hell suggests that Koechlin&#x27;s influence occasionally inhibited Poulenc&#x27;s natural simple style, and that Auric offered useful guidance to help him appear in his true colours. At a concert of music by the two friends in 1926, Poulenc&#x27;s songs were sung for the first time by the baritone Pierre Bernac, from whom, in Hell&#x27;s phrase, &quot;the name of Poulenc was soon to be inseparable.&quot; Another performer with whom the composer came to be closely associated was the harpsichordist Wanda Landowska. He heard her as the soloist in Falla&#x27;s &quot;El retablo de maese Pedro&quot; (1923), an early example of the use of a harpsichord in a modern work, and was immediately taken with the sound. At Landowska&#x27;s request he wrote a concerto, the &quot;Concert champêtre&quot;, which she premiered in 1929 with the Orchestre Symphonique de Paris conducted by Pierre Monteux.

The biographer Richard D. E. Burton comments that, in the late 1920s, Poulenc might have seemed to be in an enviable position: professionally successful and independently well-off, having inherited a substantial fortune from his father. He bought a large country house, , at Noizay, Indre-et-Loire, south-west of Paris, where he retreated to compose in peaceful surroundings.

He began his first serious affair, with the painter Richard Chanlaire to whom he sent a copy of the &quot;Concert champêtre&quot; score inscribed:

While this affair was in progress Poulenc proposed marriage to his friend Raymonde Linossier. As she was not only well aware of his homosexuality but was also romantically attached elsewhere, she refused him, and their relationship became strained. He suffered the first of many periods of depression, which affected his ability to compose, and he was devastated in January 1930 when Linossier died suddenly at the age of 32. On her death he wrote, &quot;All my youth departs with her, all that part of my life that belonged only to her. I sob ... I am now twenty years older&quot;. His affair with Chanlaire petered out in 1931, though they remained lifelong friends.

===1930s: new seriousness===
At the start of the decade, Poulenc returned to writing songs, after a two-year break from doing so. His &quot;Epitaphe&quot;, to a poem by Malherbe, was written in memory of Linossier, and is described by the pianist Graham Johnson as &quot;a profound song in every sense&quot;. The following year Poulenc wrote three sets of songs, to words by Apollinaire and Max Jacob, some of which were serious in tone, and others reminiscent of his earlier light-hearted style, as were others of his works of the early 1930s. In 1932 his music was among the first to be broadcast on television, in a transmission by the BBC in which Reginald Kell and Gilbert Vinter played his Sonata for clarinet and bassoon. At about this time Poulenc began a relationship with Raymond Destouches, a chauffeur; as with Chanlaire earlier, what began as a passionate affair changed into a deep and lasting friendship. Destouches, who married in the 1950s, remained close to Poulenc until the end of the composer&#x27;s life.
Two unrelated events in 1936 combined to inspire a reawakening of religious faith and a new depth of seriousness in Poulenc&#x27;s music. His fellow composer Pierre-Octave Ferroud was killed in a car crash so violent that he was decapitated, and almost immediately afterwards, while on holiday, Poulenc visited the sanctuary of Rocamadour. He later explained:
A few days earlier I&#x27;d just heard of the tragic death of my colleague ... As I meditated on the fragility of our human frame, I was drawn once more to the life of the spirit. Rocamadour had the effect of restoring me to the faith of my childhood. This sanctuary, undoubtedly the oldest in France ... had everything to captivate me ... The same evening of this visit to Rocamadour, I began my &quot;Litanies à la Vierge noire&quot; for female voices and organ. In that work I tried to get across the atmosphere of &quot;peasant devotion&quot; that had struck me so forcibly in that lofty chapel.

Other works that followed continued the composer&#x27;s new-found seriousness, including many settings of Éluard&#x27;s surrealist and humanist poems. In 1937 he composed his first major liturgical work, the Mass in G major for soprano and mixed choir &quot;a cappella&quot;, which has become the most frequently performed of all his sacred works. Poulenc&#x27;s new compositions were not all in this serious vein; his incidental music to the play &quot;La Reine Margot&quot;, starring Yvonne Printemps, was pastiche 16th-century dance music, and became popular under the title &quot;Suite française&quot;. Music critics generally continued to define Poulenc by his light-hearted works, and it was not until the 1950s that his serious side was widely recognised.
In 1936 Poulenc began giving frequent recitals with Bernac. At the École Normale in Paris they gave the premiere of Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Cinq poèmes de Paul Éluard&quot;. They continued to perform together for more than twenty years, in Paris and internationally, until Bernac&#x27;s retirement in 1959. Poulenc, who composed 90 songs for his collaborator, considered him one of the &quot;three great meetings&quot; of his professional career, the other two being Éluard and Landowska. In Johnson&#x27;s words, &quot;for twenty-five years Bernac was Poulenc&#x27;s counsellor and conscience&quot;, and the composer relied on him for advice not only on song-writing, but on his operas and choral music.

Throughout the decade, Poulenc was popular with British audiences; he established a fruitful relationship with the BBC in London, which broadcast many of his works. With Bernac, he made his first tour of Britain in 1938. His music was also popular in America, seen by many as &quot;the quintessence of French wit, elegance and high spirits&quot;. In the last years of the 1930s, Poulenc&#x27;s compositions continued to vary between serious and light-hearted works. &quot;Quatre motets pour un temps de pénitence&quot; (Four Penitential Motets, 1938–39) and the song &quot;Bleuet&quot; (1939), an elegiac meditation on death, contrast with the song cycle &quot;Fiançailles pour rire&quot; (Light-Hearted Betrothal), which recaptures the spirit of &quot;Les biches&quot;, in the opinion of Hell.

===1940s: war and post-war===
Poulenc was briefly a soldier again during the Second World War; he was called up on 2 June 1940 and served in an anti-aircraft unit at Bordeaux. After France surrendered to Germany, Poulenc was demobilised from the army on 18 July 1940. He spent the summer of that year with family and friends at Brive-la-Gaillarde in south-central France. In the early months of the war, he had composed little new music, instead re-orchestrating &quot;Les biches&quot; and reworking his 1932 Sextet for piano and winds. At Brive-la-Gaillarde he began three new works, and once back at his home in Noizay in October he started on a fourth. These were &quot;L&#x27;Histoire de Babar, le petit éléphant&quot; for piano and narrator, the Cello Sonata, the ballet &quot;Les Animaux modèles&quot; and the song cycle &quot;Banalités&quot;.
For most of the war, Poulenc was in Paris, giving recitals with Bernac, concentrating on French songs. Under Nazi rule he was in a vulnerable position, as a known homosexual (Destouches narrowly avoided arrest and deportation), but in his music he made many gestures of defiance of the Germans. He set to music verses by poets prominent in the French Resistance, including Aragon and Éluard. In &quot;Les Animaux modèles&quot;, premiered at the Opéra in 1942, he included the tune, repeated several times, of the anti-German song &quot;Vous n&#x27;aurez pas l&#x27;Alsace et la Lorraine&quot;. He was a founder-member of the Front National (pour musique) which the Nazi authorities viewed with suspicion for its association with banned musicians such as Milhaud and Paul Hindemith. In 1943 he wrote a cantata for unaccompanied double choir intended for Belgium, &quot;Figure humaine&quot;, setting eight of Éluard&#x27;s poems. The work, ending with &quot;Liberté&quot;, could not be given in France while the Germans were in control; its first performance was broadcast from a BBC studio in London in March 1945, and it was not sung in Paris until 1947. The music critic of &quot;The Times&quot; later wrote that the work &quot;is among the very finest choral works of our time and in itself removes Poulenc from the category of &quot;petit maître&quot; to which ignorance has generally been content to relegate him.&quot;

In January 1945, commissioned by the French government, Poulenc and Bernac flew from Paris to London, where they received an enthusiastic welcome. The London Philharmonic Orchestra gave a reception in the composer&#x27;s honour; he and Benjamin Britten were the soloists in a performance of Poulenc&#x27;s Double Piano Concerto at the Royal Albert Hall; with Bernac he gave recitals of French &quot;mélodies&quot; and piano works at the Wigmore Hall and the National Gallery, and recorded for the BBC. Bernac was overwhelmed by the public&#x27;s response; when he and Poulenc stepped out on the Wigmore Hall stage, &quot;the audience rose and my emotion was such that instead of beginning to sing, I began to weep.&quot; After their fortnight&#x27;s stay, the two returned home on the first boat-train to leave London for Paris since May 1940.

In Paris, Poulenc completed his scores for &quot;L&#x27;Histoire de Babar, le petit éléphant&quot; and his first opera, &quot;Les mamelles de Tirésias&quot; (The Breasts of Tiresias), a short opéra bouffe of about an hour&#x27;s duration. The work is a setting of Apollinaire&#x27;s play of the same name, staged in 1917. Sams describes the opera as &quot;high-spirited topsy-turveydom&quot; concealing &quot;a deeper and sadder theme – the need to repopulate and rediscover a France ravaged by war&quot;. It was premiered in June 1947 at the Opéra-Comique, and was a critical success, but did not prove popular with the public. The leading female role was taken by Denise Duval, who became the composer&#x27;s favourite soprano, frequent recital partner and dedicatee of some of his music. He called her the nightingale who made him cry (&quot;Mon rossignol à larmes&quot;).
Shortly after the war, Poulenc had a brief affair with a woman, Fréderique (&quot;Freddy&quot;) Lebedeff, with whom he had a daughter, Marie-Ange, in 1946. The child was brought up without knowing who her father was (Poulenc was supposedly her &quot;godfather&quot;) but he made generous provision for her, and she was the principal beneficiary of his will.

In the post-war period Poulenc crossed swords with composers of the younger generation who rejected Stravinsky&#x27;s recent work and insisted that only the precepts of the Second Viennese School were valid. Poulenc defended Stravinsky and expressed incredulity that &quot;in 1945 we are speaking as if the aesthetic of twelve tones is the only possible salvation for contemporary music&quot;. His view that Berg had taken serialism as far as it could go and that Schoenberg&#x27;s music was now &quot;desert, stone soup, ersatz music, or poetic vitamins&quot; earned him the enmity of composers such as Pierre Boulez. Those disagreeing with Poulenc attempted to paint him as a relic of the pre-war era, frivolous and unprogressive. This led him to focus on his more serious works, and to try to persuade the French public to listen to them. In the US and Britain, with their strong choral traditions, his religious music was frequently performed, but performances in France were much rarer, so that the public and the critics were often unaware of his serious compositions.

In 1948 Poulenc made his first visit to the US, in a two-month concert tour with Bernac. He returned there frequently until 1961, giving recitals with Bernac or Duval and as soloist in the world premiere of his Piano Concerto (1949), commissioned by the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

===1950–63: &quot;The Carmelites&quot; and last years===
Poulenc began the 1950s with a new partner in his private life, Lucien Roubert, a travelling salesman. Professionally Poulenc was productive, writing a seven-song cycle setting poems by Éluard, &quot;La Fraîcheur et le feu&quot; (1950), and the &quot;Stabat Mater&quot;, in memory of the painter Christian Bérard, composed in 1950 and premiered the following year.
In 1953, Poulenc was offered a commission by La Scala and the Milanese publisher Casa Ricordi for a ballet. He considered the story of St Margaret of Cortona but found a dance version of her life impracticable. He preferred to write an opera on a religious theme; Ricordi suggested &quot;Dialogues des Carmélites&quot;, an unfilmed screenplay by Georges Bernanos. The text, based on a short story by Gertrud von Le Fort, depicts the Martyrs of Compiègne, nuns guillotined during the French Revolution for their religious beliefs. Poulenc found it &quot;such a moving and noble work&quot;, ideal for his libretto, and he began composition in August 1953.

During the composition of the opera, Poulenc suffered two blows. He learned of a dispute between Bernanos&#x27;s estate and the writer Emmet Lavery, who held the rights to theatrical adaptations of Le Fort&#x27;s novel; this caused Poulenc to stop work on his opera. At about the same time Roubert became gravely ill. Intense worry pushed Poulenc into a nervous breakdown, and in November 1954 he was in a clinic at L&#x27;Haÿ-les-Roses, outside Paris, heavily sedated. When he recovered, and the literary rights and royalty payments disputes with Lavery were settled, he resumed work on &quot;Dialogues des Carmélites&quot; in between extensive touring with Bernac in England. As his personal wealth had declined since the 1920s he required the substantial income earned from his recitals.

While working on the opera, Poulenc composed little else; exceptions were two &quot;mélodies&quot;, and a short orchestral movement, &quot;Bucolique&quot; in a collective work, &quot;Variations sur le nom de Marguerite Long&quot; (1954), to which his old friends from &quot;Les Six&quot; Auric and Milhaud also contributed. As Poulenc was writing the last pages of his opera in October 1955, Roubert died at the age of forty-seven. The composer wrote to a friend, &quot;Lucien was delivered from his martyrdom ten days ago and the final copy of &quot;Les Carmélites&quot; was completed (take note) at the very moment my dear breathed his last.&quot;

The opera was first given in January 1957 at La Scala in Italian translation. Between then and the French premiere Poulenc introduced one of his most popular late works, the Flute Sonata, which he and Jean-Pierre Rampal performed in June at the Strasbourg Music Festival. Three days later, on 21 June, came the Paris premiere of &quot;Dialogues des Carmélites&quot; at the Opéra. It was a tremendous success, to the composer&#x27;s considerable relief. At around this time Poulenc began his last romantic relationship, with Louis Gautier, a former soldier; they remained partners to the end of Poulenc&#x27;s life.
In 1958 Poulenc embarked on a collaboration with his old friend Cocteau, in an operatic version of the latter&#x27;s 1930 monodrama &quot;La Voix humaine&quot;. The work was produced in February 1959 at the Opéra-Comique, under Cocteau&#x27;s direction, with Duval as the tragic deserted woman speaking to her former lover by telephone. In May Poulenc&#x27;s 60th birthday was marked, a few months late, by his last concert with Bernac before the latter&#x27;s retirement from public performance.
Poulenc visited the US in 1960 and 1961. Among his works given during these trips were the American premiere of &quot;La Voix humaine&quot; at Carnegie Hall in New York, with Duval, and the world premiere of his Gloria, a large-scale work for soprano, four-part mixed chorus and orchestra, conducted in Boston by Charles Munch. In 1961 Poulenc published a book about Chabrier, a 187-page study of which a reviewer wrote in the 1980s, &quot;he writes with love and insight of a composer whose views he shared on matters like the primacy of melody and the essential seriousness of humour.&quot; The works of Poulenc&#x27;s last twelve months included &quot;Sept répons des ténèbres&quot; for voices and orchestra, the Clarinet Sonata and the Oboe Sonata.

On 30 January 1963, at his flat opposite the Jardin du Luxembourg, Poulenc suffered a fatal heart attack. His funeral was at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice. In compliance with his wishes, none of his music was performed; Marcel Dupré played works by Bach on the grand organ of the church. Poulenc was buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery, alongside his family.

== Music ==

Poulenc&#x27;s music is essentially diatonic. In Henri Hell&#x27;s view, this is because the main feature of Poulenc&#x27;s musical art is his melodic gift. In the words of Roger Nichols in the &quot;Grove&quot; dictionary, &quot;For [Poulenc] the most important element of all was melody and he found his way to a vast treasury of undiscovered tunes within an area that had, according to the most up-to-date musical maps, been surveyed, worked and exhausted.&quot; The commentator George Keck writes, &quot;His melodies are simple, pleasing, easily remembered, and most often emotionally expressive.&quot;

Poulenc said that he was not inventive in his harmonic language. The composer Lennox Berkeley wrote of him, &quot;All through his life, he was content to use conventional harmony, but his use of it was so individual, so immediately recognizable as his own, that it gave his music freshness and validity.&quot; Keck considers Poulenc&#x27;s harmonic language &quot;as beautiful, interesting and personal as his melodic writing ... clear, simple harmonies moving in obviously defined tonal areas with chromaticism that is rarely more than passing&quot;. Poulenc had no time for musical theories; in one of his many radio interviews he called for &quot;a truce to composing by theory, doctrine, rule!&quot; He was dismissive of what he saw as the dogmatism of latter-day adherents to dodecaphony, led by René Leibowitz, and greatly regretted that the adoption of a theoretical approach had affected the music of Olivier Messiaen, of whom he had earlier had high hopes. To Hell, almost all Poulenc&#x27;s music is &quot;directly or indirectly inspired by the purely melodic associations of the human voice&quot;. Poulenc was a painstaking craftsman, though a myth grew up – &quot;la légende de facilité&quot; – that his music came easily to him; he commented, &quot;The myth is excusable, since I do everything to conceal my efforts.&quot;

The pianist Pascal Rogé commented in 1999 that both sides of Poulenc&#x27;s musical nature were equally important: &quot;You must accept him as a whole. If you take away either part, the serious or the non-serious, you destroy him. If one part is erased you get only a pale photocopy of what he really is.&quot; Poulenc recognised the dichotomy, but in all his works he wanted music that was &quot;healthy, clear and robust – music as frankly French as Stravinsky&#x27;s is Slav&quot;.

===Orchestral and concertante===

Poulenc&#x27;s principal works for large orchestra comprise two ballets, a Sinfonietta and four keyboard concertos. The first of the ballets, &quot;Les biches&quot;, was first performed in 1924 and remains one of his best-known works. Nichols writes in &quot;Grove&quot; that the clear and tuneful score has no deep, or even shallow, symbolism, a fact &quot;accentuated by a tiny passage of mock-Wagnerian brass, complete with emotive minor 9ths&quot;. The first two of the four concertos are in Poulenc&#x27;s light-hearted vein. The &quot;Concert champêtre&quot; for harpsichord and orchestra (1927–28), evokes the countryside seen from a Parisian point of view: Nichols comments that the fanfares in the last movement bring to mind the bugles in the barracks of Vincennes in the Paris suburbs. The Concerto for two pianos and orchestra (1932) is similarly a work intended purely to entertain. It draws on a variety of stylistic sources: the first movement ends in a manner reminiscent of Balinese gamelan, and the slow movement begins in a Mozartian style, which Poulenc gradually fills out with his own characteristic personal touches. The Organ Concerto (1938) is in a much more serious vein. Poulenc said that it was &quot;on the outskirts&quot; of his religious music, and there are passages that draw on the church music of Bach, though there are also interludes in breezy popular style. The second ballet score, &quot;Les Animaux modèles&quot; (1941), has never equalled the popularity of &quot;Les biches&quot;, though both Auric and Honegger praised the composer&#x27;s harmonic flair and resourceful orchestration. Honegger wrote, &quot;The influences that have worked on him, Chabrier, Satie, Stravinsky, are now completely assimilated. Listening to his music you think – it&#x27;s Poulenc.&quot; The Sinfonietta (1947) is a reversion to Poulenc&#x27;s pre-war frivolity. He came to feel, &quot;I dressed too young for my age ... [it] is a new version of &quot;Les biches&quot; but young girls [&quot;biches&quot;] that are forty-eight years old – that&#x27;s horrible!&quot; The Concerto for piano and orchestra (1949) initially caused some disappointment: many felt that it was not an advance on Poulenc&#x27;s pre-war music, a view he came to share. The piece has been re-evaluated in more recent years, and in 1996 the writer Claire Delamarche rated it as the composer&#x27;s finest concertante work.

===Piano===

Poulenc, a highly accomplished pianist, usually composed at the piano and wrote many pieces for the instrument throughout his career. In Henri Hell&#x27;s view, Poulenc&#x27;s piano writing can be divided into the percussive and the gentler style reminiscent of the harpsichord. Hell considers that the finest of Poulenc&#x27;s music for piano is in the accompaniments to the songs, a view shared by Poulenc himself. The vast majority of the piano works are, in the view of the writer Keith W Daniel, &quot;what might be called &#x27;miniatures&#x27;&quot;. Looking back at his piano music in the 1950s, the composer viewed it critically: &quot;I tolerate the &quot;Mouvements perpétuels&quot;, my old &quot;Suite en ut&quot; [in C], and the &quot;Trois pieces&quot;. I like very much my two collections of Improvisations, an Intermezzo in A flat, and certain Nocturnes. I condemn &quot;Napoli&quot; and the &quot;Soirées de Nazelles&quot; without reprieve.&quot;

Of the pieces cited with approval by Poulenc, the fifteen Improvisations were composed at intervals between 1932 and 1959. All are brief: the longest lasts a little more than three minutes. They vary from swift and balletic to tender lyricism, old-fashioned march, &quot;perpetuum mobile&quot;, waltz and a poignant musical portrait of the singer Édith Piaf. Poulenc&#x27;s favoured Intermezzo was the last of three. Numbers one and two were composed in August 1934; the A flat followed in March 1943. The commentators Marina and Victor Ledin describe the work as &quot;the embodiment of the word &#x27;charming&#x27;. The music seems simply to roll off the pages, each sound following another in such an honest and natural way, with eloquence and unmistakable Frenchness.&quot; The eight nocturnes were composed across nearly a decade (1929–38). Whether or not Poulenc originally conceived them as an integral set, he gave the eighth the title &quot;To serve as Coda for the Cycle&quot; (&quot;Pour servir de Coda au Cycle&quot;). Although they share their generic title with the nocturnes of Field, Chopin and Fauré, Poulenc&#x27;s do not resemble those of the earlier composers, being &quot;night-scenes and sound-images of public and private events&quot; rather than romantic tone poems.

The pieces Poulenc found merely tolerable were all early works: &quot;Trois mouvements perpétuels&quot; dates from 1919, the Suite in C from 1920 and the Trois pièces from 1928. All consist of short sections, the longest being the &quot;Hymne&quot;, the second of the three 1928 pieces, which lasts about four minutes. Of the two works their composer singled out for censure, &quot;Napoli&quot; (1925) is a three-movement portrait of Italy, and &quot;Les Soirées de Nazelles&quot; is described by the composer Geoffrey Bush as &quot;the French equivalent of Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Enigma Variations&quot;&quot; – miniature character sketches of his friends. Despite Poulenc&#x27;s scorn for the work, Bush judges it ingenious and witty. Among the piano music not mentioned, favourably or harshly, by Poulenc, the best known pieces include the two Novelettes (1927–28), the set of six miniatures for children, &quot;Villageoises&quot; (1933), a piano version of the seven-movement &quot;Suite française&quot; (1935), and &quot;L&#x27;embarquement pour Cythère&quot; for two pianos (1953).

===Chamber===
In &quot;Grove&quot;, Nichols divides the chamber works into three clearly differentiated periods. The first four sonatas come from the early group, all written before Poulenc was twenty-two. They are for two clarinets (1918), piano duo (1918), clarinet and bassoon (1922) and horn, trumpet and trombone (1922). They are early examples of Poulenc&#x27;s many and varied influences, with echoes of rococo &quot;divertissements&quot; alongside unconventional harmonies, some influenced by jazz. All four are characterised by their brevity – less than ten minutes each – their mischievousness and their wit, which Nichols describes as acid. Other chamber works from this period are the &quot;Rapsodie nègre&quot;, FP 3, from 1917 (mainly instrumental, with brief vocal episodes) and the Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano (1926).

The chamber works of Poulenc&#x27;s middle period were written in the 1930s and 1940s. The best known is the Sextet for Piano and Wind (1932), in Poulenc&#x27;s light-hearted vein, consisting of two lively outer movements and a central &quot;divertimento&quot;; this was one of several chamber works that the composer became dissatisfied with and revised extensively some years after their first performance (in this case in 1939–40). The sonatas in this group are for violin and piano (1942–43) and for cello and piano (1948). Writing for strings did not come easily to Poulenc; these sonatas were completed after two unsuccessful earlier attempts, and in 1947 he destroyed the draft of a string quartet. Both sonatas are predominantly grave in character; that for violin is dedicated to the memory of Federico García Lorca. Commentators including Hell, Schmidt and Poulenc himself have regarded it, and to some extent the cello sonata, as less effective than those for wind. The &quot;Aubade&quot;, &quot;Concerto choréographique&quot; for piano and 18 instruments (1930) achieves an almost orchestral effect, despite its modest number of players. The other chamber works from this period are arrangements for small ensembles of two works in Poulenc&#x27;s lightest vein, the &quot;Suite française&quot; (1935) and the &quot;Trois mouvements perpétuels&quot; (1946).

The final three sonatas are for woodwind and piano: for flute (1956–57), clarinet (1962), and oboe (1962). They have, according to &quot;Grove&quot;, become fixtures in their repertoires because of &quot;their technical expertise and of their profound beauty&quot;. The &quot;Élégie&quot; for horn and piano (1957) was composed in memory of the horn player Dennis Brain. It contains one of Poulenc&#x27;s rare excursions into dodecaphony, with the brief employment of a twelve-note tone row.

===Songs===

Poulenc composed songs throughout his career, and his output in the genre is extensive. In Johnson&#x27;s view, most of the finest were written in the 1930s and 1940s. Though widely varied in character, the songs are dominated by Poulenc&#x27;s preference for certain poets. From the outset of his career he favoured verses by Guillaume Apollinaire, and from the mid-1930s the writer whose work he set most often was Paul Éluard. Other poets whose works he frequently set included Jean Cocteau, Max Jacob, and Louise de Vilmorin. In the view of the music critic Andrew Clements, the Éluard songs include many of Poulenc&#x27;s greatest settings; Johnson calls the cycle &quot;Tel Jour, Telle Nuit&quot; (1937) the composer&#x27;s &quot;watershed work&quot;, and Nichols regards it as &quot;a masterpiece worthy to stand beside Fauré&#x27;s &quot;La Bonne Chanson&quot;&quot;. Clements finds in the Éluard settings a profundity &quot;worlds away from the brittle, facetious surfaces of Poulenc&#x27;s early orchestral and instrumental music&quot;. The first of the &quot;Deux poèmes de Louis Aragon&quot; (1943), titled simply &quot;C&quot;, is described by Johnson as &quot;a masterpiece known the world over; it is the most unusual, and perhaps the most moving, song about the ravages of war ever composed.&quot;

In an overview of the songs in 1973, the musical scholar Yvonne Gouverné said, &quot;With Poulenc, the melodic line matches the text so well that it seems in some way to complete it, thanks to the gift which the music has for penetrating the very essence of a given poem; nobody has better crafted a phrase than Poulenc, highlighting the colour of the words.&quot; Among the lighter pieces, one of the composer&#x27;s most popular songs is a setting of &quot;Les Chemins de l&#x27;amour&quot; for Jean Anouilh&#x27;s 1940 play as a Parisian waltz; by contrast his &quot;monologue&quot; &quot;La Dame de Monte Carlo&quot;, (1961) a depiction of an elderly woman addicted to gambling, shows the composer&#x27;s painful understanding of the horrors of depression.

===Choral===
Apart from a single early work for unaccompanied choir (&quot;Chanson à boire&quot;, 1922), Poulenc began writing choral music in 1936. In that year he produced three works for choir: &quot;Sept chansons&quot; (settings of verses by Éluard and others), &quot;Petites voix&quot; (for children&#x27;s voices), and his religious work &quot;Litanies à la Vierge Noire&quot;, for female or children&#x27;s voices and organ. The Mass in G major (1937) for unaccompanied choir is described by Gouverné as having something of a baroque style, with &quot;vitality and joyful clamour on which his faith is writ large&quot;. Poulenc&#x27;s new-found religious theme continued with &quot;Quatre motets pour un temps de pénitence&quot; (1938–39), but among his most important choral works is the secular cantata &quot;Figure humaine&quot; (1943). Like the Mass, it is unaccompanied, and to succeed in performance it requires singers of the highest quality. Other &quot;a cappella&quot; works include the &quot;Quatre motets pour le temps de Noël&quot; (1952), which make severe demands on choirs&#x27; rhythmic precision and intonation.

Poulenc&#x27;s major works for choir and orchestra are the &quot;Stabat Mater&quot; (1950), the &quot;Gloria&quot; (1959–60), and &quot;Sept répons des ténèbres&quot; (Seven responsories for &quot;Tenebrae&quot;, 1961–62). All these works are based on liturgical texts, originally set to Gregorian chant. In the &quot;Gloria&quot;, Poulenc&#x27;s faith expresses itself in an exuberant, joyful way, with intervals of prayerful calm and mystic feeling, and an ending of serene tranquillity. Poulenc wrote to Bernac in 1962, &quot;I have finished Les Ténèbres. I think it is beautiful. With the Gloria and the Stabat Mater, I think I have three good religious works. May they spare me a few days in Purgatory, if I narrowly avoid going to hell.&quot; &quot;Sept répons des ténèbres&quot;, which Poulenc did not live to hear performed, uses a large orchestra, but in Nichols&#x27;s view it displays a new concentration of thought. To the critic Ralph Thibodeau, the work may be considered as Poulenc&#x27;s own requiem and is &quot;the most avant-garde of his sacred compositions, the most emotionally demanding, and the most interesting musically, comparable only with his &quot;magnum opus sacrum&quot;, the opera, &quot;Dialogues des Carmélites&quot;.&quot;

===Opera===

Poulenc turned to opera only in the latter half of his career. Having achieved fame by his early twenties, he was in his forties before attempting his first opera. He attributed this to the need for maturity before tackling the subjects he chose to set. In 1958 he told an interviewer, &quot;When I was 24 I was able to write &quot;Les biches&quot; [but] it is obvious that unless a composer of 30 has the genius of a Mozart or the precociousness of Schubert he couldn&#x27;t write &quot;The Carmelites&quot; – the problems are too profound.&quot; In Sams&#x27;s view, all three of Poulenc&#x27;s operas display a depth of feeling far distant from &quot;the cynical stylist of the 1920s&quot;: &quot;Les Mamelles de Tirésias&quot; (1947), despite the riotous plot, is full of nostalgia and a sense of loss. In the two avowedly serious operas, &quot;Dialogues des Carmélites&quot; (1957) and &quot;La Voix humaine&quot; (1959), in which Poulenc depicts deep human suffering, Sams sees a reflection of the composer&#x27;s own struggles with depression.

In terms of musical technique the operas show how far Poulenc had come from his naïve and insecure beginnings. Nichols comments in &quot;Grove&quot; that &quot;Les mamelles de Tirésias&quot;, deploys &quot;lyrical solos, patter duets, chorales, falsetto lines for tenor and bass babies and ... succeeds in being both funny and beautiful&quot;. In all three operas Poulenc drew on earlier composers, while blending their influence into music unmistakably his own. In the printed score of &quot;Dialogues des Carmélites&quot; he acknowledged his debt to Mussorgsky, Monteverdi, Debussy and Verdi. The critic Renaud Machart writes that &quot;Dialogues des Carmélites&quot; is, with Britten&#x27;s &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;, one of the extremely rare operas written since the Second World War to appear on opera programmes all over the world.

Even when he wrote for a large orchestra, Poulenc used the full forces sparingly in his operas, often scoring for woodwinds or brass or strings alone. With the invaluable input of Bernac he showed great skill in writing for the human voice, fitting the music to the tessitura of each character. By the time of the last of the operas, &quot;La Voix humaine&quot;, Poulenc felt able to give the soprano stretches of music with no orchestral accompaniment at all, though when the orchestra plays, Poulenc calls for the music to be &quot;bathed in sensuality&quot;.

===Recordings===
Poulenc was among the composers who recognised in the 1920s the important role that the gramophone would play in the promotion of music. The first recording of his music was made in 1928, with the mezzo-soprano Claire Croiza accompanied by the composer at the piano, in the complete song cycle &quot;La bestiaire&quot; for French Columbia. He made numerous recordings, mainly for the French division of EMI. With Bernac and Duval he recorded many of his own songs, and those of other composers including Chabrier, Debussy, Gounod and Ravel. He played the piano part in recordings of his &quot;Babar the Elephant&quot; with Pierre Fresnay and Noël Coward as narrators. In 2005, EMI issued a DVD, &quot;Francis Poulenc &amp; Friends&quot;, featuring filmed performances of Poulenc&#x27;s music, played by the composer, with Duval, Jean-Pierre Rampal, Jacques Février and Georges Prêtre.

A 1984 discography of Poulenc&#x27;s music lists recordings by more than 1,300 conductors, soloists and ensembles, including the conductors Leonard Bernstein, Charles Dutoit, Milhaud, Charles Munch, Eugene Ormandy, Prêtre, André Previn and Leopold Stokowski. Among the singers, in addition to Bernac and Duval, the list includes Régine Crespin, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Nicolai Gedda, Peter Pears, Yvonne Printemps and Gérard Souzay. Instrumental soloists include Britten, Jacques Février, Pierre Fournier, Emil Gilels, Yehudi Menuhin and Arthur Rubinstein.

Complete sets of Poulenc&#x27;s solo piano music have been recorded by Gabriel Tacchino, who had been Poulenc&#x27;s only piano student (released on the EMI label), Pascal Rogé (Decca), Paul Crossley (CBS), Eric Parkin (Chandos). Éric Le Sage (RCA) and Olivier Cazal (Naxos). Integral sets of the chamber music have been recorded by the Nash Ensemble (Hyperion), Éric Le Sage and various French soloists (RCA) and a variety of young French musicians (Naxos).

The world premiere of &quot;Dialogues des Carmélites&quot; (in Italian, as &quot;Dialoghi delle Carmelitane&quot;) was recorded and has been released on CD. The first studio recording was soon after the French premiere, and since then there have been at least ten live or studio recordings on CD or DVD, most of them in French but one in German and one in English.

==Reputation==
The two sides to Poulenc&#x27;s musical nature caused misunderstanding during his life and have continued to do so. The composer Ned Rorem observed, &quot;He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual&quot;; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested in the works of younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, &quot;Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people&#x27;s work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. I remember him playing me the records of Boulez&#x27;s &quot;Le marteau sans maître&quot; with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today.&quot; Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, &quot;There are always people who will take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after &quot;Sacre [du Printemps]&quot;. It was not progress.&quot; Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc&#x27;s work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: &quot;You are truly good, and that is what I find again and again in your music&quot;.

In his last years Poulenc observed, &quot;if people are still interested in my music in 50 years&#x27; time it will be for my &quot;Stabat Mater&quot; rather than the &quot;Mouvements perpétuels&quot;.&quot; In a centenary tribute in &quot;The Times&quot; Gerald Larner commented that Poulenc&#x27;s prediction was wrong, and that in 1999 the composer was widely celebrated for both sides of his musical character: &quot;both the fervent Catholic and the naughty boy, for both the Gloria and Les Biches, both Les Dialogues des Carmélites and Les Mamelles de Tirésias.&quot; At around the same time the writer Jessica Duchen described Poulenc as &quot;a fizzing, bubbling mass of Gallic energy who can move you to both laughter and tears within seconds. His language speaks clearly, directly and humanely to every generation.&quot;

<doc id="144510" wikidata="Q17087189" url="?curid=144510" title="In Bed with Medinner">
<text>In Bed with Medinner is a late-night British TV programme starring Bob Mills and originally broadcast in the 1990s. It is a precursor to the contemporary &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s TV Burp&quot;, Russell Brand&#x27;s &quot;Ponderland&quot; and Paddy McGuinness&#x27;s &quot;Paddy&#x27;s TV Guide&quot;.

&quot;In Bed with Medinner&quot; was a London Weekend Television production for ITV. Stand-up comic Bob Mills specialised in a cynical view of life and its everyday objects, and in pastiches of popular culture icons.

The show was set in Mills&#x27; home, which was dressed to resemble the home of Number Six from &quot;The Prisoner&quot; and, in the final series, Steed&#x27;s flat from &quot;The Avengers&quot;. The first three series opened with a parody of &quot;The Prisoner&quot; while the fourth and final series was re-titled &quot;Still In Bed With Medinner&quot;, and the opening sequence changed to be a parody of the classic &quot;Avengers&quot; Series Five title sequence.

Mills wanders around his flat (actually a studio set), telling ludicrous fictional anecdotes about his showbusiness friends and reminiscing about his (fictional) time as a television producer. These stories are illustrated by genuine clips from the ITV archives, which, interspersed with Mills&#x27; own heavily contrived commentaries and bizarre non-sequiturs, come together to reveal surreal fictional backstories.

==Original broadcasts and video releases==
&quot;In Bed with Medinner&quot; ran from 1992 through to 1999, totalling 60 episodes: fifty-four 30-minute episodes and six 60-minute episodes.
* Series One consisted of two 30-minute specials shown 20 November and 27 November 1992.
* Series Two consisted of six 60-minute episodes and ran from 8 April to 13 May 1994.
* Series Three consisted of twenty-six 30-minute episodes and ran from 11 January to 22 November 1997. 
* Series Four consisted of twenty-six 30-minute episodes and ran from 6 February to 24 April 1998 and 10 January to 25 April 1999.
* An hour-long compilation of highlights of the first and second series &quot;Wot a Palaver − The Best of In Bed with Medinner&quot; broadcast by London-area ITV on 2 August 1996, having been released on VHS on 26 September 1994.

==Cultural references==

The title was a parody of Madonna&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="144514" wikidata="Q81788" url="?curid=144514" title="Giza">
<text>Giza (; sometimes spelled &quot;Gizah, Gizeh, Geeza, Jiza&quot;; , , &quot;&quot; ) is the third-largest city in Egypt by area after Cairo and Alexandria; and fourth-largest city in Africa by population after Kinshasa, Lagos, and Cairo. It is the capital of Giza Governorate with a total population of 4,872,448 in the 2017 census. It is located on the west bank of the Nile opposite central Cairo, and is a part of the Greater Cairo metropolis. Giza lies less than north of Memphis (&quot;Men-nefer,&quot; today the village of Mit Rahina), which was the capital city of the unified Egyptian state during the reign of pharaoh Narmer, roughly 3100 BC.

Giza is most famous as the location of the Giza Plateau, the site of some of the most impressive ancient monuments in the world, including a complex of ancient Egyptian royal mortuary and sacred structures, among which are the Great Sphinx, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and a number of other large pyramids and temples. Giza has always been a focal point in Egypt&#x27;s history due to its location close to Memphis, the ancient pharaonic capital of the Old Kingdom.

== Districts and population ==
The city of Giza is the capital of the Giza Governorate, and is located near the northeast border of this governorate.

===2017 population and administrative divisions===

Giza city is a municipal division and capital of Giza governorate with an appointed city head. It comprises nine districts (&quot;ahya&quot;&#x27;, singl. &quot;hayy&quot;) and five new towns &quot;(mudun jadidah)&quot; administered by the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA).

The districts/qisms fully subsume to the city head and according to the 2017 census had 4,872,448 residents:

The new towns are mostly administered by the national level New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA), with some public services under the jurisdiction of Giza. They are confusingly named &quot;madina&quot; (city), however they are not administratively incorporated as such where many are formed of a single district or qism. Ones not in the 2017 census as they were not yet incorporated, or inhabited at that time are:

*New 6th of October
*October Gardens
*New Sphinx

Permanently inhabited Nile islands:

* Qorsaya Island (Janoub/Giza district)
* Dahab Island (Janoub/Giza district)
* Al-Warraq Island (Al-Warraq district)

=== 2006 population ===
The city&#x27;s population was reported as 2,681,863 in the 2006 national census, while the governorate had 6,272,571 at the same census, without specifying what the city is. The former figure corresponds to the sum of nine districts/qisms.

== Geography and Climate==
Giza&#x27;s most famous landform and archaeological site, the Giza Plateau, holds some major monuments of Egyptian history, and is home to the Great Sphinx. Once thriving with the Nile that flowed right into the Giza Plateau, the pyramids of Giza were built overlooking the ancient Egyptian capital city of Memphis, across the river from modern day Cairo. The Great Pyramid of Giza at one time was advocated (1884) as the location for the Prime Meridian, a reference point used for determining a base longitude.

===Climate===
Giza experiences a hot desert like arid climate (Köppen: BWh). Its climate is similar to Cairo, owing to its proximity. Windstorms can be frequent across Egypt in spring, bringing Saharan dust into the city during the months of March and April. High temperatures in winter range from , while nighttime lows drop to below . In summer, the highs are , and the lows can drop to about . Rain is infrequent in Giza; snow is extremely rare.

Up to August 2013, the highest recorded temperature was on 13 June 1965, while the lowest recorded temperature was on 8 January 1966.

==History==
===Ancient era===

The area in what is now Giza served as the necropolis of several pharaohs who ruled ancient Egypt, during the second millennium BC. Three of these tombs, in the form of giant pyramids, are what is now the famed Giza pyramid complex, featuring the Great Pyramid of Giza.

===Classical to medieval era===

As ancient Egypt passed under several conquests under the Persians, Greeks, Romans and Byzantines, so did the area in what is now Giza. A Byzantine village named &quot;Phylake&quot; () or &quot;Terso&quot; (, meaning &quot;the fortress&quot;, now &quot;Tersa&quot;) was located south of Giza and should not be confused with it.

Egyptians called the area Tipersis (Bohairic and Sahidic ). Eutychius gives a legend about the city&#x27;s name and its foundation by Artaxerxes Ochus or Hūš (), and Abu Salih says it was found by him at the same time as Qasr ash-Sham, but as older evidence is missing, it is perhaps most likely to have been founded during the Sasanian conquest of Egypt in the early 7th century.

As Muslims of the fledgling Islamic caliphate went on with their conquest of Egypt from the Byzantine Empire beginning in 639 AD, three years after their victory at the battle of Yarmouk in 636 AD, they conquered all of the land by the time they captured the city of Alexandria in 641 AD. A year later in 642 AD (year 21 in Islamic calendar), they founded the city of Giza. The exact etymology of its name is unknown. Al-Maqrizi suggested an irregular Arameo-Arabic root meaning &quot;edge, side&quot; to be the source. Everett-Heath suggested &quot;on the side of the height (pyramid)&quot;. Peust also suggests a Persian etymology of the word from , which Persians could have given to the pyramids or a fortress they found in the area.

==Infrastructure==

Giza has seen many changes over time. Changes in infrastructure during the different occupations of Egypt by various rulers, including the British in the 18th and early 20th century, focused on the construction of roads, streets, and buildings in the area. Giza is a thriving centre of Egyptian culture and is quite heavily populated, with many facilities and buildings in the current area. Giza saw much attention in particular to its vast amount of ancient Egyptian monuments found on the Giza Plateau, and has astonished thousands of visitors and tourists over the years. Giza&#x27;s infrastructure saw much attention from both the British government prior to the 1952 coup d&#x27;état, as well as the current Egyptian government due to the city&#x27;s importance in tourism. Giza&#x27;s St. George Cathedral is the episcopal see of the Coptic Catholic Eparchy of Giza.

The city hosts the first zoo on the entire African continent and one of the oldest in the Mediterranean region, the Giza Zoo. In addition, there are several parks, the most famous among them is Orman Park, which means &quot;Forest Park&quot; in the Turkish language.

== Giza Zoo ==
The Giza Zoo (, &quot;Ḥadīqat Ḥaywān Al-Gīzah&quot;), established on March 1, 1891, holds the distinction of being Africa&#x27;s first zoo and the world&#x27;s third oldest zoological garden. Located on approximately 80 acres (32 hectares), the zoo was originally designed as a botanical garden and features several historical architectural elements.

=== Historical Features ===
The zoo contains several notable architectural and cultural landmarks:
* A suspension bridge designed by Gustave Eiffel (1875-1879), considered the world&#x27;s first elevated zoo viewing platform
* The Japanese Kiosk, constructed in 1924 during King Fuad&#x27;s reign
* Original gates from the Khedive&#x27;s Palace and Haramlik Palace
* Roads paved with black stone imported from Trieste
* Mosaic-decorated footpaths
* A marble island known as Tea Island

=== Animal Collection ===
The zoo houses approximately 4,000 animals representing over 175 species, including:
* Large mammals: Lions, tigers, giraffes, rhinoceros, hippopotamuses
* Primates: Various monkey and ape species
* Birds: Native and exotic species including flamingos and rare birds
* Reptiles: Including Egyptian cobras and Nile crocodiles

=== Recent Developments ===
In 2023, the Egyptian government announced plans to expand the number of animal species from 71 to 186. The renovation project includes:
* Creation of specialized zones: Asia, Africa, America, Family Zone, Safari Trips
* Establishment of educational centers
* Preservation of historical landmarks
* Improvement of animal enclosures

=== Operating Hours ===
* Summer (April-September): 8:30 AM - 5:00 PM
* Winter (October-March): 8:30 AM - 4:00 PM

The zoo serves multiple functions as a recreational facility, research institute, and cultural landmark.

===Transportation===

Transportation in Giza comprises an extensive road network, rail system, subway system, and maritime services. Road transport is facilitated by personal vehicles, taxi cabs, privately owned public buses and microbuses.

Giza shares with Cairo a subway system, officially called the &quot;Metro (مترو)&quot;, a fast and efficient way of getting around. An extensive road network connects Giza with 6th of October City, Cairo and other cities. There are flyovers and bridges such as the 15th. Traffic in Giza is known to be overwhelming and overcrowded.

Other means of transport include:

* Cairo Taxi
* Uber (available in Cairo and Giza since 2015)
* Careem (available in Cairo and Giza since 2015)
* Swvl (available in Cairo and Giza since 2017)
* Water taxis (motorized feluccas) available for transport to nearby places along the Nile River

==Economy==
Industries here include movies, chemicals, Giza cotton, machinery and cigarettes. In addition, Giza has many luxury apartment buildings along the Nile, making it a popular place to live.

===International access===
Access to the city of Giza, which has its own governorate adjacent to the Governorate of Cairo, is dependent on the Cairo International Airport. Another local airport is found in Giza, called the Imbaba Airport, but recently the Egyptian government has decided to shut down the area and turn it into a cultural or an athletic area.

Sphinx International Airport was opened in 2018 as an alternative to the already congested Cairo International Airport, but also to improve accessibility to the Giza necropolis as well as to the Grand Egyptian Museum.

==Education==

Giza&#x27;s learning institutions include Cairo University, which was moved to Giza in 1924. The city is a hub of education and educational services not only for Egypt but also for the entire Mediterranean Region. Giza has numerous schools, kindergartens, and institutes of higher learning.

The Cairo Japanese School, a Japanese international school, is in Giza. The Deutsche Evangelische Oberschule, a German international school, is located in Dokki in Giza. Previously the Pakistan International School of Cairo had its campus in Giza.

==Sports==

The city hosts the second most successful sports club in Egypt and Africa, El Zamalek, which is located in the Meet Okba neighbourhood near the Mohandesin neighbourhood. Beside El Zamalek there are other clubs like El Tersana and Seid Shooting Club which is one of the elite clubs in Egypt.

== Twin towns and sister cities ==
Giza is twinned with:

* Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei Darussalam
* Bergen, Norway
* Los Angeles, United States
* Rinkeby, Stockholm, Sweden

==Notable people==

<text>Robert Edward Mills (born 30 June 1957) is an English comedian and broadcaster, who has appeared in the television series &quot;In Bed with Medinner&quot; and &quot;The Show&quot;.

==Early life==

Mills was born in Chester and attended Chester City Grammar School. After a very short spell of training for the Merchant Navy, he quit and worked as a valet in King&#x27;s Cross, London and as a Hoffman dry cleaning presser operator, driver and delivery man. After seeing Kevin Day and Eddie Zibbin (Pat Condell) at the Market Tavern in Islington in 1983, he decided to become a comedian and was a mainstay for the British &#x27;stand-up&#x27; circuit for several years.

==TV career==

In 1983 Mills played a villain as Lon&#x27;s Bodyguard in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; opposite Peter Davison as The Doctor and Martin Clunes as Lon. In the 1990s Mills hosted the daytime quiz show &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot; on ITV and the video games programme &quot;Games World&quot; on Sky One. He graduated to his own stand-up comedy show on ITV, &quot;In Bed With MeDinner&quot;, well known for its introduction, a remake of the opening credits of &quot;The Prisoner&quot; with Mills in the place of Patrick McGoohan. He is also a writer, having written the Michael Barrymore comedy &quot;Bob Martin&quot;. He created and wrote the Robson Green vehicle &quot;Christmas Lights&quot;, and the spin-off series &quot;Northern Lights&quot;. He also wrote the screenplay for the film &quot;Pierrepoint&quot;.

==Radio career==

Bob Mills presented his own weekday programme in the 1990s on Greater London Radio from 10pm to 1am. This was during the period when other comedians also had their own programmes on GLR such as Mark Lamarr and Phill Jupitus.

He is a regular pundit on BBC Radio 5 Live&#x27;s &quot;Fighting Talk&quot;, and was the holder of the Copa de Croix Saint Simon, awarded to the annual FT Champion of Champions, having defeated Martin Kelner in the 2010 Final. This, he recently revealed, is his &quot;most prestigious achievement in a life of anonymity.&quot; He lost the 2011 final to Tom Watt.

On 7 October 2011 Mills made his debut on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The News Quiz&quot;. He has subsequently returned for further appearances.

He appeared on Talksport co-presenting with Jim White between 10am and 1pm. Mills also hosted a weekly three-hour radio programme called &quot;Tragedy Plus Time&quot; on TalkRadio each Sunday, in which comedy and light entertainment were among the subjects discussed.

==Personal life==

Mills is a supporter of Leyton Orient and is frequently mentioned in his radio broadcasts, he has also written a regular column in the Leyton Orient matchday programme. His uncle Eric Lee played in The Football League for Chester City.

<doc id="144531" wikidata="Q1528" url="?curid=144531" title="Ramesses III">
<text>Usermaatre Meryamun Ramesses III was the second Pharaoh of the Twentieth Dynasty in Ancient Egypt. Some scholars date his reign from 26 March 1186 to 15 April 1155 BC, and he is considered the last pharaoh of the New Kingdom to have wielded substantial power. 

His long reign saw the decline of Egyptian political and economic power, linked to a series of invasions and internal economic problems that also plagued pharaohs before him. This coincided with a decline in the cultural sphere of Ancient Egypt. 

However, his successful defense was able to slow down the decline, although it still meant that his successors would have a weaker military. He has also been described as a &quot;warrior Pharaoh&quot; due to his strong military strategies. He led the way by defeating the invaders known as &quot;the Sea Peoples&quot;, who had caused destruction in other civilizations and empires. He was able to save Egypt from collapsing at the time when many other empires fell during the Late Bronze Age; however, the damage of the invasions took a toll on Egypt. 

Rameses III constructed one of the largest mortuary temples of western Thebes, now called Medinet Habu. He was assassinated in the Harem conspiracy led by his secondary wife Tiye and her eldest son Pentawere. This would ultimately cause a succession crisis which would further accelerate the decline of Ancient Egypt. He was succeeded by his son and designated successor Ramesses IV, although many of his other sons would rule later.

==Name==
Ramesses (also written Ramses and Rameses) two main names transliterate as wsr-mꜢʿt-rʿ–mry-ỉmn rʿ-ms-s–ḥḳꜢ-ỉwnw. They are normally realised as &quot;Usermaatre-Meryamun Rameses-Heqaiunu&quot;, meaning &quot;The Ma&#x27;at of Ra is strong, Beloved of Amun, Born of Ra, Ruler of Heliopolis&quot;.

==Early Years==
Ramesses III was not closely related to Ramesses I or Ramesses II.
He was the son of Setnakhte and Tiy-Merenese who wrote her name in a cartouche. Setnakhte&#x27;s origin is unknown. He seized the throne during a time of crisis and political unrest likely from Twosret and he was presumably a minor descendant of Ramesses II through a separate family line from that of Seti II, Siptah and Twosret.

==Accession==
Ramesses III is believed to have reigned from March 1186 to April 1155 BC. This is based on his known accession date of I Shemu day 26 and his death on Year 32 III Shemu day 15. Some scholars estimate a reign of 31 years, 1 month and 19 days. Alternative dates for his reign are 1187–1156 BC.

In a description of his coronation from Medinet Habu, four doves were said to be &quot;dispatched to the four corners of the horizon to confirm that the living Horus, Ramses III, is (still) in possession of his throne, that the order of Maat prevails in the cosmos and society&quot;.

==Tenure of constant war==

During his long tenure in the midst of the surrounding political chaos of the Late Bronze Age collapse, Egypt was beset by foreign invaders (including the so-called Sea Peoples and the Libyans) and experienced the beginnings of increasing economic difficulties and internal strife which would eventually lead to the collapse of the Twentieth Dynasty.

In Year 8 of his reign, the Sea Peoples, including Peleset, Denyen, Shardana, Meshwesh of the sea, and Tjekker, invaded Egypt by land and sea. Ramesses III defeated them in two great land and sea battles. First, he defeated them on land in the Battle of Djahy on the Egyptian Empire&#x27;s easternmost frontier in Djahy or modern-day southern Lebanon. The second one was the Battle of the Delta, in which Ramesses enticed the Sea Peoples and their ships into the mouth of the Nile, where he had assembled a fleet in ambush. Although the Egyptians had a reputation as poor seamen, they fought tenaciously. Rameses lined the shores with ranks of archers who kept up a continuous volley of arrows into the enemy ships when they attempted to land on the banks of the Nile. Then, the Egyptian navy attacked using grappling hooks to haul in the enemy ships. In the brutal hand-to-hand fighting which ensued, the Sea Peoples were utterly defeated. The Harris Papyrus states:
Ramesses III incorporated the Sea Peoples as subject peoples and settled them in southern Canaan. Their presence in Canaan may have contributed to the formation of new states in this region such as Philistia after the collapse of the Egyptian Empire in Asia. During the reign of Ramses III, Egyptian presence in the Levant is still attested as far as Byblos and he may have campaigned further north into Syria. Ramesses III was also compelled to fight invading Libyan tribesmen in two major campaigns in Egypt&#x27;s Western Delta in his Year 5 and Year 11 respectively. By the early 12th century, Egypt claimed overlordship of Cyrenaican tribes. At one point a ruler chosen by Egypt was set up (briefly) over the combined tribes of Meshwesh, Libu, and Soped.

==Economic turmoil==
The heavy cost of these battles slowly exhausted Egypt&#x27;s treasury and contributed to the gradual decline of the Egyptian Empire in Asia. The severity of these difficulties is stressed by the fact that the first known labour strike in recorded history occurred during Year 29 of Ramesses III&#x27;s reign, when the food rations for the favoured and elite royal tomb-builders and artisans in the village of &quot;Set Maat her imenty Waset&quot; (now known as Deir el-Medina), could not be provisioned. Something in the air (possibly the Hekla 3 eruption) prevented much sunlight from reaching the ground and also arrested global tree growth for almost two full decades until 1140 BC. The result in Egypt was a substantial increase in grain prices under the later reigns of Ramesses VI-VII, whereas the prices for fowl and slaves remained constant. Thus the cooldown affected Ramesses III&#x27;s final years and impaired his ability to provide a constant supply of grain rations to the workmen of the Deir el-Medina community.

These difficult realities are completely ignored in Ramesses&#x27; official monuments, many of which seek to emulate those of his famous predecessor, Ramesses II, and which present an image of continuity and stability. He built important additions to the temples at Luxor and Karnak, and his funerary temple and administrative complex at Medinet-Habu is amongst the largest and best-preserved in Egypt; however, the uncertainty of Ramesses&#x27; times is apparent from the massive fortifications which were built to enclose the latter. No temple in the heart of Egypt prior to Ramesses&#x27; reign had ever needed to be protected in such a manner.
==Assassination==

Thanks to the discovery of papyrus trial transcripts (dated to Ramesses III), it is now known that there was a plot against his life as a result of a royal harem conspiracy during a celebration at Medinet Habu On day 15 of month 2 of Shemu 1155 BCE. The conspiracy was instigated by Tiye, one of his three known wives (the others being Tyti and Iset Ta-Hemdjert), over whose son would inherit the throne. Tyti&#x27;s son, Ramesses Amenherkhepshef (the future Ramesses IV), was the eldest and the successor chosen by Ramesses III in preference to Tiye&#x27;s son Pentaweret.

The trial documents show that many individuals were implicated in the plot. Chief among them were Queen Tiye and her son Pentaweret, Ramesses&#x27; chief of the chamber, Pebekkamen, seven royal butlers (a respectable state office), two Treasury overseers, two Army standard bearers, two royal scribes and a herald. There is little doubt that all of the main conspirators were executed: some of the condemned were given the option of committing suicide (possibly by poison) rather than being put to death. According to the surviving trial transcripts, a total of three separate trials were started, while 38 people were sentenced to death. The tombs of Tiye and her son Pentaweret were robbed and their names erased to prevent them from enjoying an afterlife. The Egyptians did such a thorough job of this that the only references to them are the trial documents and what remains of their tombs.

Some of the accused harem women tried to seduce the members of the judiciary who tried them but were caught in the act. Judges who were involved were severely punished.
Ramesses IV, the king&#x27;s designated successor, assumed the throne upon his death rather than Pentaweret, who was intended to be the main beneficiary of the palace conspiracy. Moreover, Ramesses III died in his 32nd year before the summaries of the sentences were composed, but the same year that the trial documents record the trial and execution of the conspirators.
Although it was long believed that Ramesses III&#x27;s body showed no obvious wounds, an examination of the mummy by a German forensic team, televised in the documentary &quot;Ramesses: Mummy King Mystery&quot; on the Science Channel in 2011, showed excessive bandages around the neck. A subsequent CT scan that was done in Egypt by Ashraf Selim and Sahar Saleem, professors of radiology at Cairo University, revealed that beneath the bandages was a deep knife wound across the throat, deep enough to reach the vertebrae. According to the documentary narrator, &quot;It was a wound no one could have survived.&quot; The CT scan revealed that his throat was cut to the bone, severing the trachea, esophagus, and blood vessels, which would have been rapidly fatal. The December 2012 issue of the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; quoted the conclusion of the study of the team of researchers, led by Zahi Hawass, the former head of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquity, and his Egyptian team, as well as Albert Zink from the Institute for Mummies and the Iceman of Eurac Research in Bolzano, Italy, which stated that conspirators murdered Ramesses III by cutting his throat. Zink observed in an interview that:

A subsequent study of the CT scan of the mummy of Ramesses III&#x27;s body by Sahar Saleem revealed that the left big toe was likely chopped by a heavy sharp object like an ax. There were no signs of bone healing so this injury must have happened shortly before death. The embalmers placed a prosthesis-like object made of linen in place of the amputated toe. The embalmers placed six amulets around both feet and ankles for magical healing of the wound for the life after. This additional injury of the foot supports the assassination of the Pharaoh, likely by the hands of multiple assailants using different weapons.

Before this discovery it had been speculated that Ramesses III had been killed by means that would not have left a mark on the body. Among the conspirators were practitioners of magic, who might well have used poison. Some had put forth a hypothesis that a snakebite from a viper was the cause of the king&#x27;s death. His mummy includes an amulet to protect Ramesses III in the afterlife from snakes. The servant in charge of his food and drink were also among the listed conspirators, but there were also other conspirators who were called the snake and the lord of snakes.

In one respect the conspirators certainly failed. The crown passed to the king&#x27;s designated successor: Ramesses IV. Ramesses III may have been doubtful as to the latter&#x27;s chances of succeeding him, given that, in the Great Harris Papyrus, he implored Amun to ensure his son&#x27;s rights.

==DNA and possible relationship with his son Pentaware==

The Zink unit determined that the mummy of an unknown man buried with Ramesses was, because of the proven genetic relationship and a mummification process that suggested punishment, a good candidate for the pharaoh&#x27;s son, Pentawere, who was the only son to revolt against his father. It was impossible to determine his cause of death. Both mummies were predicted by Whit Athey&#x27;s STR-predictor to share the Y chromosomal haplogroup E1b1a-V38 and 50% of their genetic material, which pointed to a father-son relationship.

In 2010 Hawass et al undertook detailed anthropological, radiological, and genetic studies as part of the King Tutankhamun Family Project. The objectives included attempting to determine familial relationships among 11 royal mummies of the New Kingdom, as well to research for pathological features including potential inherited disorders and infectious diseases. In 2012, Hawass et al undertook an anthropological, forensic, radiological, and genetic study of the 20th dynasty mummies of Ramesses III and an unknown man which were found together. In 2022, S.O.Y. Keita analysed 8 Short Tandem loci (STR) data published as part of these studies by Hawass et al, using an algorithm that only has three choices: Eurasians, sub-Saharan Africans, and East Asians. Using these three options, Keita concluded that the majority of the samples, which included the genetic remains of Rameses III and Tutankhamun had a population &quot;affinity with &#x27;sub-Saharan&#x27; Africans in one affinity analysis&quot;. However, Keita cautioned that this does not mean that the royal mummies “lacked other affiliations” which he argued had been obscured in typological thinking. Keita further added that different “data and algorithms might give different results” which reflects the complexity of biological heritage and the associated interpretation.

==Legacy==
The Great Harris Papyrus or Papyrus Harris I, which was commissioned by his son and chosen successor Ramesses IV, chronicles this king&#x27;s vast donations of land, gold statues and monumental construction to Egypt&#x27;s various temples at Piramesse, Heliopolis, Memphis, Athribis, Hermopolis, This, Abydos, Coptos, El Kab and various cities in Nubia. It also records that the king dispatched a trading expedition to the Land of Punt and quarried the copper mines of Timna in southern Canaan. Papyrus Harris I records some of Ramesses III&#x27;s activities:


Ramesses began the reconstruction of the Temple of Khonsu at Karnak from the foundations of an earlier temple of Amenhotep III and completed the Temple of Medinet Habu around his Year 12. He decorated the walls of his Medinet Habu temple with scenes of his naval and land battles against the Sea Peoples. This monument stands today as one of the best-preserved temples of the New Kingdom.

The mummy of Ramesses III was discovered by antiquarians in 1886 and is regarded as the prototypical Egyptian Mummy in numerous Hollywood movies. His tomb (KV11) is one of the largest in the Valley of the Kings.

In 1980, James Harris and Edward F. Wente conducted a series of X-ray examinations on New Kingdom Pharaohs crania and skeletal remains, which included the mummified remains of Ramesses III. The analysis in general found strong similarities between the New Kingdom rulers of the 19th Dynasty and 20th Dynasty with Mesolithic Nubian samples. The authors also noted affinities with modern Mediterranean populations of Levantine origin. Harris and Wente suggested this represented admixture as the Rammessides were of northern origin.

In April 2021 his mummy was moved from the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization along with those of 17 other kings and 4 queens in an event termed the Pharaohs&#x27; Golden Parade.

==Chronological dispute==
There is uncertainty regarding the exact dates of the reign of Ramesses III. This uncertainty affects the dating of the Late Bronze/Iron Age transition in the Levant. This transition is defined by the appearance of Mycenaean LH IIIC:1b (Philistine) pottery in the coastal plain of Palestine, generally assumed to correspond to the settlement of Sea Peoples there at the 8th year of Ramesses III. Radiocarbon dates and other external evidence permit this transition to be as late as 1100 BC, compared to the conventional dating of c. 1179 BC.

Some scientists have tried to establish a chronological point for this pharaoh&#x27;s reign at 1159 BC, based on a 1999 dating of the Hekla 3 eruption of the Hekla volcano in Iceland. Since contemporary records show that the king experienced difficulties provisioning his workmen at Deir el-Medina with supplies in his 29th Year, this dating of Hekla 3 might connect his 28th or 29th regnal year to c. 1159 BC. A minor discrepancy of one year is possible since Egypt&#x27;s granaries could have had reserves to cope with at least a single bad year of crop harvests following the onset of the disaster. This implies that the king&#x27;s reign would have ended just three to four years later, around 1156 or 1155 BC. A rival date of &quot;2900 BP&quot; (950 BC) has since been proposed by scientists based on a re-examination of the volcanic layer. Given that no Egyptologist dates Ramesses III&#x27;s reign to as late as 1000 BC, this would mean that the Hekla 3 eruption presumably occurred well after Ramesses III&#x27;s reign. A 2002 study, using high-precision radiocarbon dating of a peat deposit containing ash layers, put this eruption in the range 1087–1006 BC.

<text>Sub Pop is an independent record label founded in 1986 by Bruce Pavitt and Jonathan Poneman. Sub Pop achieved fame in the early 1990s for signing Seattle bands such as Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Mudhoney, central players in the grunge movement. They are often credited with helping popularize grunge music. The label&#x27;s roster includes Fleet Foxes, Tad, Beach House, The Postal Service, Sleater-Kinney, Flight of the Conchords, Foals, Blitzen Trapper, Father John Misty, clipping., Shabazz Palaces, Weyes Blood, Guerilla Toss, Bully, La Luz, Low, METZ, Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever, Kiwi Jr., TV Priest and The Shins. In 1995, the owners of Sub Pop sold a 49% stake of the label to the Warner Music Group.

==History==
===Formation===
The origins of Sub Pop trace back to the early 1980s, when Bruce Pavitt started a fanzine called &quot;Subterranean Pop&quot; that focused exclusively on American independent record labels. Pavitt undertook the project in order to earn course credit while attending Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington. By the fourth issue, Pavitt had shortened the name to &quot;Sub Pop&quot; and began alternating issues with compilation tapes of underground rock bands. The &quot;Sub Pop #5&quot; cassette, released in 1982, sold two thousand copies. In 1983, Pavitt moved to Seattle, Washington, and released the ninth and final issue of &quot;Sub Pop&quot;. While in Seattle, he wrote a column for local music magazine &quot;The Rocket&quot; titled &quot;Sub Pop U.S.A.&quot;, a column he ended in 1988.

In 1986, Pavitt released the first Sub Pop LP, the compilation &quot;Sub Pop 100&quot;, which featured material by artists including Sonic Youth, Naked Raygun, Wipers, and Scratch Acid. Seattle group Green River chose to record their &quot;Dry as a Bone&quot; EP for Pavitt&#x27;s new label in June 1986; Pavitt couldn&#x27;t afford to release it until the following year. When finally released, &quot;Dry as a Bone&quot; was promoted by Sub Pop as &quot;ultra-loose grunge that destroyed the morals of a generation&quot;. Also in 1987, Jonathan Poneman provided $20,000 in funding for Sub Pop to release the debut Soundgarden single &quot;Hunted Down&quot;/&quot;Nothing to Say&quot; in July 1987, followed by the band&#x27;s first EP &quot;Screaming Life&quot; that October. Poneman soon became a full partner in the label. Pavitt focused on the label&#x27;s artists and repertoire aspects, while Poneman dealt with the business and legal issues. Both men decided they wanted the label to focus on &quot;this primal rock stuff that was coming out,&quot; according to Pavitt.

===The &quot;Seattle sound&quot;===

In early 1988, Pavitt and Poneman quit their jobs to devote their full attention to Sub Pop. Raising $43,000, they incorporated on April 1, 1988. &quot;Of course that was spent in, like, thirty days&quot;, Pavitt recalled. &quot;We almost went bankrupt after a month&quot;. That August Sub Pop released the first single by Mudhoney, a band featuring former members of Green River. Sub Pop released the Mudhoney single &quot;Touch Me I&#x27;m Sick&quot; in an intentionally limited first pressing of 800 copies to create demand. The strategy was later adopted by other independent labels.

Pavitt and Poneman studied earlier independent labels ranging from Motown to SST Records and decided that virtually every successful movement in rock music had a regional basis. The pair sought to create a cohesive brand identity for Sub Pop. The label&#x27;s ads promoted the label itself more than any particular band. The label also sought to market a &quot;Seattle sound&quot;, which was accomplished with the help of producer Jack Endino, who produced 75 singles, albums, and EPs for Sub Pop between 1987 and 1989. Endino recorded cheaply and quickly; in order to operate this way, he utilized some consistent studio techniques, which gave the records a similar sound.

In November 1988, Sub Pop released &quot;Love Buzz&quot;, the debut single by Aberdeen, Washington band Nirvana, as the first entry in the Sub Pop Singles Club, a subscription service that would allow subscribers to receive singles by the label on a monthly basis by mail. At its peak in 1990, the club had two thousand subscribers. The club made Sub Pop a powerful force in the Seattle scene, and effectively made the label&#x27;s name synonymous with the music of the Seattle area—much in the same way Motown Records was to Detroit—and helped to secure the label&#x27;s cash flow. The original series was discontinued in 1993, followed by &quot;Singles Club V.2&quot;, launched in 1998 and discontinued in 2002.

Some commentators have argued that Sub Pop reframed the history of Seattle&#x27;s music scene as part of their marketing campaign. Even in the late 1980s, the peak of grunge as a regional scene, Seattle&#x27;s bands could not easily be confined to a single genre, since groups often blended musical styles and techniques, drawing, for example, on folk rock, psychedelic rock, garage rock, and pop hooks. The &quot;Seattle sound&quot; cultivated and marketed by Sub Pop became known as grunge, while other Seattle bands like The U-Men, who preceded Sub-Pop, became pioneers of avant garde post-punk.

Mindful that garnering the attention of the American mainstream music press was difficult for all but the largest indie label, Pavitt and Ponemen took inspiration from alternative bands like Sonic Youth, Butthole Surfers, and Dinosaur Jr. and sought to publicize the label via the British music press. In March 1989, Pavitt and Poneman flew &quot;Melody Maker&quot; journalist Everett True to Seattle to write an article on the local music scene. As Pavitt had anticipated, the British press became enamoured with Sub Pop and the grunge sound. Pavitt said, &quot;I really felt that the Brits and the Europeans wanted to see something that was unruly and that was more of an American archetype -- something that was really primal and really drew from the roots of rock &amp; roll, which was very American.&quot; Poneman explained the label&#x27;s success: &quot;It could have happened anywhere, but there was a lucky set of coincidences. Charles Peterson was here to document the scene, Jack Endino was here to record the scene. Bruce and I were here to exploit the scene.&quot;

By 1991, Sub Pop were in financial difficulties, leading Mudhoney and Tad to depart the label and delaying the release of The Afghan Whigs&#x27; &quot;Congregation&quot; (1992). When Geffen Records bought Nirvana&#x27;s contract from Sub Pop for $72,000, it was agreed that the former would pay the latter a percentage of any profits from the band&#x27;s major label debut, &quot;Nevermind&quot; (1991). A stipulation was also implemented where selected future Nirvana studio LPs were required to carry the Sub Pop logo alongside Geffen&#x27;s. The album&#x27;s subsequent commercial success quickly brought Sub Pop out of their financial difficulties. Pavitt noted: &quot;By Christmas [1991], &quot;Nevermind&quot; had sold 2 million. We went from not being able to pay our phone bill to getting a check for half a million bucks.&quot; Sales of &quot;Bleach&quot; helped keep the label going for years afterwards. The mainstream success of Nirvana also brought Poneman and Pavitt worldwide media attention as the self-stylized &quot;creators of the grunge scene&quot;. After the suicide of Kurt Cobain and the subsequent decline of grunge, Poneman began signing acts that were &quot;not typically Sub Pop-ian&quot;, such as 5ive Style, Combustible Edison and Eric Matthews. In 1995, the label signed a $20 million joint venture with Warner Bros. Records (which had distributed Geffen since that label was founded in 1980; after 10 years under Warner, Geffen was sold to MCA Music Entertainment Group), who acquired 49% of the label&#x27;s stock.

===Post-Pavitt===
Poneman and Pavitt had a disagreement about the direction the label should take, with Poneman wanting the label to become larger and make more money. In 1996, unable to take the new corporate culture following the Warner partnership, Pavitt left the label and was able to spend more time with his family. The split between Pavitt and Poneman was not amicable, and they did not speak for seven years.

The label opened offices worldwide and began major investment in new artists, but without achieving great commercial success, prompting a scaling down and a return to Seattle.

In 2006, Sub Pop Records became the first Green-e certified record label. Through work with the Green-e program and the Bonneville Environmental Foundation, Sub Pop &quot;greened&quot; their label by purchasing enough renewable energy certificates to offset 100 percent of the electricity they use in their office, showing their commitment to putting renewable energy in the mainstream as a way consumers can take action to do something about global warming.

In early 2007, Sub Pop started a sister label by the name of Hardly Art. This label is also partially owned by Warner Music. In August 2008, Sub Pop relaunched the singles club for one year to celebrate its twentieth anniversary.

In 2009, they signed their second hip-hop group, Seattle-based Shabazz Palaces – the first being The Evil Tambourines in 1999. Ishmael Butler, one half of Shabazz Palaces and former member of jazz rap group Digable Planets became A&amp;R for Sub Pop.

==Commercial success==
Domestically, Sub Pop has released three albums that have been certified as platinum, for sales of over 1 million units, by the Recording Industry Association of America: &quot;Bleach&quot; by Nirvana, &quot;Give Up&quot; by The Postal Service, and &quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot; by The Shins.

Ten albums released by the label have been certified gold for sales of 500,000 copies: &quot;Chutes Too Narrow&quot; and &quot;Wincing the Night Away&quot; by The Shins; &quot;Fleet Foxes&quot; and &quot;Helplessness Blues&quot; by Fleet Foxes; &quot;The Head and the Heart&quot; by The Head and the Heart; &quot;Everything All the Time&quot; and &quot;Cease to Begin&quot; by Band of Horses; &quot;Our Endless Numbered Days&quot; and &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Dog&quot; by Iron &amp; Wine; and &quot;Depression Cherry&quot; by Beach House.

==Deluxe editions==
Starting in 2008, Sub Pop has released Deluxe Editions of its top-selling albums, which features a remastered version of the album, as well as some live tracks and demos. The albums released under this were Nirvana’s &quot;Bleach&quot;, Mudhoney&#x27;s &quot;Superfuzz Bigmuff&quot;, Sebadoh&#x27;s &quot;Bakesale&quot;, Jason Loewenstein&#x27;s &quot;Codes&quot;, The Postal Service&#x27;s &quot;Give Up&quot;, and Red Red Meat&#x27;s &quot;Bunny Gets Paid&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Sub Pop, its founders, and some acts on the label were featured on season 1, episode 5 of Vice Media&#x27;s &quot;Dark Side of the 90&#x27;s&quot; entitled &quot;Grunge and the Seattle Sound&quot;.

In the 2000 film High Fidelity, a Sub Pop sticker can be seen in several scenes that take place in the main character’s record store.

In David Fincher’s &quot;The Killer&quot;, the central villain, played by Arliss Howard, wears a Sub Pop T-shirt.

<text>Georges Guibourg (June 3, 1891 – January 8, 1970) was a French singer, author, writer, playwright, and actor, George Guibourg, alias &quot;Georgius&quot;, alias &quot;Theodore Crapulet&quot;, was one of the most popular and versatile performers in Paris for more than 50 years.

Guibourg was born at Mantes-la-Ville, Yvelines, France. He began studying the piano at the age of 11 and at age 16 went to Paris where he performed on stage, singing extracts of traditional operettas and lovesongs. Over the next few years he performed his lovesongs at various concert halls and cabarets and appeared in a musical comedy in Montparnasse.

In the 1920s and 1930s, he became one of the most popular singers of Paris, putting together his own comedy troop, performing at the Moulin Rouge, Bobino, Alhambra Club and the Casino de Paris.

In 1932, he appeared in a motion picture with the comedian Fernandel, and between then and the 1950s he appeared in six films as well as serving as the artistic director of three different theatres. He also wrote a play and several detective novels.

He died at Bazoches-sur-Guyonne, Yvelines, Île-de-France, the author of more than 1,500 songs.

<doc id="144551" wikidata="Q13645339" url="?curid=144551" title="Knapping">
<text>Knapping is the shaping of flint, chert, obsidian, or other conchoidal fracturing stone through the process of lithic reduction to manufacture stone tools, strikers for flintlock firearms, or to produce flat-faced stones for building or facing walls, and flushwork decoration. The original Germanic term &quot;knopp&quot; meant to strike, shape, or work, so it could theoretically have referred equally well to making statues or dice. Modern usage is more specific, referring almost exclusively to the free hand percussion process pictured. It is distinguished from the more general verb &quot;chip&quot; (to break up into small pieces, or unintentionally break off a piece of something) and is different from &quot;carve&quot; (removing only part of a face), and &quot;cleave&quot; (breaking along a natural plane).

== Method ==
Flintknapping or knapping is done in a variety of ways depending on the purpose of the final product. For stone tools and flintlock strikers, chert is worked using a fabricator such as a hammerstone to remove lithic flakes from a nucleus or core of tool stone. Stone tools can then be further refined using wood, bone, and antler tools to perform pressure flaking.

For building work a hammer or pick is used to split chert nodules supported on the lap. Often the chert nodule will be split in half to create two cherts with a flat circular face for use in walls constructed of lime. More sophisticated knapping is employed to produce near-perfect cubes which are used as bricks.

=== Tools ===
There are many different methods of shaping stone into useful tools. Early knappers could have used simple hammers made of wood or antler to shape stone tools. The factors that contribute to the knapping results are varied, but the EPA (exterior platform angle) indeed influences many attributes, such as length, thickness and termination of flakes.

&quot;Hard hammer&quot; techniques are used to remove large flakes of stone. Early knappers and hobbyists replicating their methods often use cobbles of very hard stone, such as quartzite. This technique can be used by flintknappers to remove broad flakes that can be made into smaller tools. This method of manufacture is believed to have been used to make some of the earliest stone tools ever found, some of which date from over 2 million years ago.

&quot;Soft hammer&quot; techniques are more precise than hard hammer methods of shaping stone. Soft hammer techniques allow a knapper to shape a stone into many different kinds of cutting, scraping, and projectile tools. These &quot;soft hammer&quot; techniques also produce longer, thinner flakes, potentially allowing for material conservation or a lighter lithic tool kit to be carried by mobile societies.

&quot;Pressure flaking&quot; involves removing narrow flakes along the edge of a stone tool. This technique is often used to do detailed thinning and shaping of a stone tool. Pressure flaking involves putting a large amount of force across a region on the edge of the tool and (when successful) causing a narrow flake to come off of the stone. Modern hobbyists often use pressure flaking tools with a copper or brass tip, but early knappers could have used antler tines or a pointed wooden punch; traditionalist knappers still use antler tines and copper-tipped tools. The major advantage of using soft metals rather than wood or bone is that the metal punches wear down less and are less likely to break under pressure.

== Uses ==

In cultures that have not adopted metalworking technologies, the production of stone tools by knappers is common, but in modern cultures the making of such tools is the domain of experimental archaeologists and hobbyists. Archaeologists usually undertake the task so that they can better understand how prehistoric stone tools were made.

Knapping is often learned by outdoor enthusiasts.

Knapping &quot;gun flints&quot;, used by flintlock firearms was formerly a major industry in flint-bearing locations, such as Brandon in Suffolk, England, and the small towns of Meusnes and Couffy in France. Meusnes has a small museum dedicated to the industry.

In 1804, during the Napoleonic Wars, Brandon was supplying over 400,000 flints a month for use by the British Army and Navy. Brandon knappers made gun flints for export to Africa as late as the 1960s.

Knapping for building purposes is still a skill that is practiced in the flint-bearing regions of southern England, such as Sussex, Suffolk, and Norfolk, and in northern France, especially Brittany and Normandy, where there is a resurgence of the craft due to government funding.

==Health hazards==
The sustained inhalation of flint dust produced by knapping can cause silicosis. This has been called &quot;the world&#x27;s first industrial disease&quot;. However, it is unclear how severe the issue may actually have been in prehistoric working conditions, as silicosis is aggravated by a lack of ventilation and the use of metal tools which produce more dust. Ancient knappers, working in the open air and with stone and bone tools, would have had less prolonged exposure to dust than in more modern workshops.

When gun flint knapping was a large-scale industry in Brandon, Suffolk, silicosis was widely known as &quot;knappers&#x27; rot&quot;. It has been claimed silicosis was responsible for the early death of three-quarters of Brandon gun flint makers. In one workshop, seven of the eight workers died of the condition before the age of fifty. The average age of death for knappers was 44 years, compared to 66 for other employed men in the same area.

Modern knappers are advised to work in the open air to reduce the dust hazard, and to wear eye and hand protection. Some modern knappers wear a respirator to guard against dust. A 2020 survey of 173 knappers found that 86% used eye protection, 57% wore gloves, and only 5% used a respirator, mask, or fan to control dust (although 68% preferred to knap outdoors). About half of respondents reported being injured at least &quot;often&quot; when knapping, and 23% admitted having to seek professional medical attention at least once. The most commons injuries were cuts and bruises, typically on the fingers and hands, while flakes in the eye were also frequent. 

== Contemporary study ==
Modern American interest in knapping can be traced back to the study of a California Native American called Ishi who lived in the early twentieth century. Ishi taught scholars and academics traditional methods of making stone tools and how to use them for survival in the wild. Early European explorers to the New world were also exposed to flint knapping techniques. Additionally, several pioneering nineteenth-century European experimental knappers are also known and in the late 1960s and early 1970s experimental archaeologist Don Crabtree published texts such as &quot;Experiments in Flintworking&quot;. François Bordes was an early writer on Old World knapping; he experimented with ways to replicate stone tools found across Western Europe. These authors helped to ignite a small craze in knapping among archaeologists and prehistorians.

English archaeologist Phil Harding is another contemporary expert, whose exposure on the television series &quot;Time Team&quot; has led to him being a familiar figure in the UK and beyond. Many groups, with members from all walks of life, can now be found across the United States and Europe. These organizations continue to demonstrate and teach various ways of shaping stone tools.

<text>A projectile is an object that is propelled by the application of an external force and then moves freely under the influence of gravity and air resistance. Although any objects in motion through space are projectiles, they are commonly found in warfare and sports (for example, a thrown baseball, kicked football, fired bullet, shot arrow, stone released from catapult).

In ballistics, mathematical equations of motion are used to analyze projectile trajectories through launch, flight, and impact.

==Motive force==

Blowguns and pneumatic rifles use compressed gases, while most other guns and cannons utilize expanding gases liberated by sudden chemical reactions by propellants like smokeless powder. Light-gas guns use a combination of these mechanisms.

Railguns utilize electromagnetic fields to provide a constant acceleration along the entire length of the device, greatly increasing the muzzle velocity.

Some projectiles provide propulsion during flight by means of a rocket engine or jet engine. In military terminology, a rocket is unguided, while a missile is guided. Note the two meanings of &quot;rocket&quot; (weapon and engine): an ICBM is a guided missile with a rocket engine.

An explosion, whether or not by a weapon, causes the debris to act as multiple high velocity projectiles. An explosive weapon or device may also be designed to produce many high velocity projectiles by the break-up of its casing; these are correctly termed &quot;fragments&quot;.

==In sports ==

In projectile motion the most important force applied to the ‘projectile’ is the propelling force, in this case the propelling forces are the muscles that act upon the ball to make it move, and the stronger the force applied, the more propelling force, which means the projectile (the ball) will travel farther. See pitching, bowling.

==As a weapon==

===Delivery projectiles===
Many projectiles, e.g. shells, may carry an explosive charge or another chemical or biological substance. Aside from explosive payload, a projectile can be designed to cause special damage, e.g. fire (see also early thermal weapons), or poisoning (see also arrow poison).

===Kinetic projectiles===
==Wired projectiles==
Some projectiles stay connected by a cable to the launch equipment after launching it:
* for guidance: wire-guided missile (range up to )
* to administer an electric shock, as in the case of a Taser (range up to ); two projectiles are shot simultaneously, each with a cable.
* to make a connection with the target, either to tow it towards the launcher, as with a whaling harpoon, or to draw the launcher to the target, as a grappling hook does.

==Typical projectile speeds==


==Equations of motion==

An object projected at an angle to the horizontal has both the vertical and horizontal components of velocity. The vertical component of the velocity on the y-axis is given as formula_1 while the horizontal component of the velocity is formula_2. There are various calculations for projectiles at a specific angle formula_3:

1. Time to reach maximum height. It is symbolized as (formula_4), which is the time taken for the projectile to reach the maximum height from the plane of projection. Mathematically, it is given as formula_5 where formula_6 = acceleration due to gravity (app 9.81 m/s²), formula_7 = initial velocity (m/s) and formula_3 = angle made by the projectile with the horizontal axis.

2. Time of flight (formula_9): this is the total time taken for the projectile to fall back to the same plane from which it was projected. Mathematically it is given as formula_10.

3. Maximum Height (formula_11): this is the maximum height attained by the projectile OR the maximum displacement on the vertical axis (y-axis) covered by the projectile. It is given as formula_12.

4. Range (formula_13): The Range of a projectile is the horizontal distance covered (on the x-axis) by the projectile. Mathematically, formula_14. The Range is maximum when angle formula_3 = 45°, i.e. formula_16.

<text>In mathematics, specifically group theory, a nilpotent group &quot;G&quot; is a group that has an upper central series that terminates with &quot;G&quot;. Equivalently, it has a central series of finite length or its lower central series terminates with {1}.

Intuitively, a nilpotent group is a group that is &quot;almost abelian&quot;. This idea is motivated by the fact that nilpotent groups are solvable, and for finite nilpotent groups, two elements having relatively prime orders must commute. It is also true that finite nilpotent groups are supersolvable. The concept is credited to work in the 1930s by Russian mathematician Sergei Chernikov.

Nilpotent groups arise in Galois theory, as well as in the classification of groups. They also appear prominently in the classification of Lie groups.

Analogous terms are used for Lie algebras (using the Lie bracket) including [[nilpotent Lie algebra|nilpotent]], lower central series, and upper central series.

==Definition==
The definition uses the idea of a central series for a group. The following are equivalent definitions for a nilpotent group :

For a nilpotent group, the smallest such that has a central series of length is called the nilpotency class of ; and is said to be nilpotent of class . (By definition, the length is if there are formula_1 different subgroups in the series, including the trivial subgroup and the whole group.)

Equivalently, the nilpotency class of equals the length of the lower central series or upper central series.
If a group has nilpotency class at most , then it is sometimes called a nil- group.

It follows immediately from any of the above forms of the definition of nilpotency, that the trivial group is the unique group of nilpotency class , and groups of nilpotency class  are exactly the non-trivial abelian groups.

==Examples==
* As noted above, every abelian group is nilpotent.
* For a small non-abelian example, consider the quaternion group &quot;Q&quot;8, which is a smallest non-abelian &quot;p&quot;-group. It has center {1, −1} of order 2, and its upper central series is {1}, {1, −1}, &quot;Q&quot;8; so it is nilpotent of class 2.
* The direct product of two nilpotent groups is nilpotent.
* All finite &quot;p&quot;-groups are in fact nilpotent (proof). For &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1, the maximal nilpotency class of a group of order &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; is &quot;n&quot; - 1 (for example, a group of order &quot;p&quot;&quot;2&quot; is abelian). The 2-groups of maximal class are the generalised quaternion groups, the dihedral groups, and the semidihedral groups.
* Furthermore, every finite nilpotent group is the direct product of &quot;p&quot;-groups.
* The multiplicative group of upper unitriangular &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrices over any field &quot;F&quot; is a nilpotent group of nilpotency class &quot;n&quot; − 1. In particular, taking &quot;n&quot; = 3 yields the Heisenberg group &quot;H&quot;, an example of a non-abelian infinite nilpotent group. It has nilpotency class 2 with central series 1, &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;H&quot;), &quot;H&quot;.
* The multiplicative group of invertible upper triangular &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrices over a field &quot;F&quot; is not in general nilpotent, but is solvable.
* Any nonabelian group &quot;G&quot; such that &quot;G&quot;/&quot;Z&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is abelian has nilpotency class 2, with central series {1}, &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;G&quot;), &quot;G&quot;.

The natural numbers &quot;k&quot; for which any group of order &quot;k&quot; is nilpotent have been characterized .

==Explanation of term==
Nilpotent groups are called so because the &quot;adjoint action&quot; of any element is nilpotent, meaning that for a nilpotent group formula_2 of nilpotence degree formula_3 and an element formula_4, the function formula_5 defined by formula_6 (where formula_7 is the commutator of formula_4 and formula_9) is nilpotent in the sense that the formula_3th iteration of the function is trivial: formula_11 for all formula_9 in formula_2.

This is not a defining characteristic of nilpotent groups: groups for which formula_14 is nilpotent of degree formula_3 (in the sense above) are called formula_3-Engel groups, and need not be nilpotent in general. They are proven to be nilpotent if they have finite order, and are conjectured to be nilpotent as long as they are finitely generated.

An abelian group is precisely one for which the adjoint action is not just nilpotent but trivial (a 1-Engel group).

==Properties==

Since each successive factor group &quot;Z&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1/&quot;Z&quot;&quot;i&quot; in the upper central series is abelian, and the series is finite, every nilpotent group is a solvable group with a relatively simple structure.

Every subgroup of a nilpotent group of class &quot;n&quot; is nilpotent of class at most &quot;n&quot;; in addition, if &quot;f&quot; is a homomorphism of a nilpotent group of class &quot;n&quot;, then the image of &quot;f&quot; is nilpotent of class at most &quot;n&quot;.

The following statements are equivalent for finite groups, revealing some useful properties of nilpotency:

Proof:
; (a)→(b): By induction on |&quot;G&quot;|. If &quot;G&quot; is abelian, then for any &quot;H&quot;, &quot;N&quot;&quot;G&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) = &quot;G&quot;. If not, if &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is not contained in &quot;H&quot;, then &quot;h&quot;&quot;Z&quot;&quot;H&quot;&quot;Z&quot;−1&quot;h−1&quot; = &quot;h&#x27;H&#x27;h−1&quot; = &quot;H&quot;, so &quot;H&quot;·&quot;Z&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) normalizers &quot;H&quot;. If &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is contained in &quot;H&quot;, then &quot;H&quot;/&quot;Z&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is contained in &quot;G&quot;/&quot;Z&quot;(&quot;G&quot;). Note, &quot;G&quot;/&quot;Z&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is a nilpotent group. Thus, there exists a subgroup of &quot;G&quot;/&quot;Z&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) which normalizes &quot;H&quot;/&quot;Z&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) and &quot;H&quot;/&quot;Z&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is a proper subgroup of it. Therefore, pullback this subgroup to the subgroup in &quot;G&quot; and it normalizes &quot;H&quot;. (This proof is the same argument as for &quot;p&quot;-groupsthe only fact we needed was if &quot;G&quot; is nilpotent then so is &quot;G&quot;/&quot;Z&quot;(&quot;G&quot;)so the details are omitted.)
; (b)→(c): Let &quot;p&quot;1,&quot;p&quot;2...,&quot;p&quot;&quot;s&quot; be the distinct primes dividing its order and let &quot;P&quot;&quot;i&quot; in &quot;Syl&quot;&quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;G&quot;), 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;s&quot;. Let &quot;P&quot; = &quot;P&quot;&quot;i&quot; for some &quot;i&quot; and let &quot;N&quot; = &quot;N&quot;&quot;G&quot;(&quot;P&quot;). Since &quot;P&quot; is a normal Sylow subgroup of &quot;N&quot;, &quot;P&quot; is characteristic in &quot;N&quot;. Since &quot;P&quot; char &quot;N&quot; and &quot;N&quot; is a normal subgroup of &quot;N&quot;&quot;G&quot;(&quot;N&quot;), we get that &quot;P&quot; is a normal subgroup of &quot;N&quot;&quot;G&quot;(&quot;N&quot;). This means &quot;N&quot;&quot;G&quot;(&quot;N&quot;) is a subgroup of &quot;N&quot; and hence &quot;N&quot;&quot;G&quot;(&quot;N&quot;) = &quot;N&quot;. By (b) we must therefore have &quot;N&quot; = &quot;G&quot;, which gives (c).
; (c)→(d): Let &quot;p&quot;1,&quot;p&quot;2...,&quot;p&quot;&quot;s&quot; be the distinct primes dividing its order and let &quot;P&quot;&quot;i&quot; in &quot;Syl&quot;&quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;G&quot;), 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;s&quot;. For any &quot;t&quot;, 1 ≤ &quot;t&quot; ≤ &quot;s&quot; we show inductively that &quot;P&quot;1&quot;P&quot;2···&quot;P&quot;&quot;t&quot; is isomorphic to &quot;P&quot;1×&quot;P&quot;2×···×&quot;P&quot;&quot;t&quot;. Note first that each &quot;P&quot;&quot;i&quot; is normal in &quot;G&quot; so &quot;P&quot;1&quot;P&quot;2···&quot;P&quot;&quot;t&quot; is a subgroup of &quot;G&quot;. Let &quot;H&quot; be the product &quot;P&quot;1&quot;P&quot;2···&quot;P&quot;&quot;t&quot;−1 and let &quot;K&quot; = &quot;P&quot;&quot;t&quot;, so by induction &quot;H&quot; is isomorphic to &quot;P&quot;1×&quot;P&quot;2×···×&quot;P&quot;&quot;t&quot;−1. In particular,|&quot;H&quot;| = |&quot;P&quot;1|⋅|&quot;P&quot;2|⋅···⋅|&quot;P&quot;&quot;t&quot;−1|. Since |&quot;K&quot;| = |&quot;P&quot;&quot;t&quot;|, the orders of &quot;H&quot; and &quot;K&quot; are relatively prime. Lagrange&#x27;s Theorem implies the intersection of &quot;H&quot; and &quot;K&quot; is equal to 1. By definition,&quot;P&quot;1&quot;P&quot;2···&quot;P&quot;&quot;t&quot; = &quot;HK&quot;, hence &quot;HK&quot; is isomorphic to &quot;H&quot;×&quot;K&quot; which is equal to &quot;P&quot;1×&quot;P&quot;2×···×&quot;P&quot;&quot;t&quot;. This completes the induction. Now take &quot;t&quot; = &quot;s&quot; to obtain (d).
; (d)→(e): Note that a p-group of order &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot; has a normal subgroup of order &quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot; for all 1≤&quot;m&quot;≤&quot;k&quot;. Since &quot;G&quot; is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, and normality is preserved upon direct product of groups, &quot;G&quot; has a normal subgroup of order &quot;d&quot; for every divisor &quot;d&quot; of |&quot;G&quot;|.
; (e)→(a): For any prime &quot;p&quot; dividing |&quot;G&quot;|, the Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroup is normal. Thus we can apply (c) (since we already proved (c)→(e)).

Statement (d) can be extended to infinite groups: if &quot;G&quot; is a nilpotent group, then every Sylow subgroup &quot;G&quot;&quot;p&quot; of &quot;G&quot; is normal, and the direct product of these Sylow subgroups is the subgroup of all elements of finite order in &quot;G&quot; (see torsion subgroup).

Many properties of nilpotent groups are shared by hypercentral groups.

<doc id="144570" wikidata="Q1262541" url="?curid=144570" title="History of the constitution of the United Kingdom">
<text>The constitution of the United Kingdom is an uncodified constitution made up of various statutes, judicial precedents, convention, treaties and other sources. Beginning in the Middle Ages, the constitution developed gradually in response to various crises. By the 20th century, the British monarchy had become a constitutional and ceremonial monarchy, and Parliament developed into a representative body exercising parliamentary sovereignty.

Initially, the constitutional systems of the four constituent countries of the United Kingdom developed separately under English domination. The Kingdom of England conquered Wales in 1283, but it was only later through the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 that the country was brought completely under English law. While technically a separate state, the Kingdom of Ireland was ruled by the English monarchy. 

From 1603 to 1707, England and the Kingdom of Scotland shared the same monarch as part of the Union of the Crowns; however, each nation maintained separate governments. In 1707, England and Scotland were joined in the Kingdom of Great Britain. In 1801, Great Britain and Ireland were joined in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Most of Ireland seceded in 1922 creating the present-day United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. While the United Kingdom remains a unitary state in which Parliament is sovereign, a process of devolution began in the 20th and 21st centuries that saw Parliament restore self-government to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 

One of the oldest constitutional systems in the world, dating back over one thousand years, it is characterised by the stability of its governing institutions, its capacity to absorb change, a bicameral legislature and the concept of responsible government. Aspects of the British constitution were adopted in the constitutions and legal systems of other countries around the world, particularly those that were part of, or formerly part of, the British Empire including the United States and the many countries that adopted the Westminster parliamentary system. The British constitution is the source of the modern concepts of the rule of law, parliamentary sovereignty and judicial independence and adoption of British constitutional principles propagated their spread around the world. 

== Kingdom of England ==

=== Anglo-Saxon government (800-1066) ===

In the 9th and 10th centuries, the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were consolidated under the rule of the House of Wessex into a single Kingdom of England. Kings had extensive powers to make laws, mint coins, levy taxes, raise armies, regulate trade, and determine foreign policy. The current British coronation service largely dates back to 973. Edgar the Peaceful and subsequent monarchs swore a coronation oath to protect the English church, defend their people against enemies, and to administer justice.

The king was advised by a group of councilors or &quot;wise men&quot; called a witan, composed of lords and church leaders. The witan was consulted when creating law and was the highest court in the land where the king gave final judgment in person. In times of crisis or when a king was too young to rule, the witan may have assumed greater role over government.

While a capital existed at Winchester (where the royal treasury was located), the king and his itinerant court moved constantly throughout the kingdom. Priests attached to the king&#x27;s chapel acted as royal secretaries—writing letters, charters, and other official documents. Under Edward the Confessor (), the office of chancellor appears for the first time. Regenbald, the first chancellor, kept the king&#x27;s seal and oversaw the writing of charters and writs. The treasury had probably developed into a permanent institution by the time of King Cnut (). During the Confessor&#x27;s reign, supervision of the treasury was one of the responsibilities of the king&#x27;s or chamberlains.

By the tenth century, England was divided into shires and subdivided into hundreds. The hundred was the basic unit of government and overseen by a reeve. The shire was presided over by the &quot;shire reeve&quot; or sheriff. Sheriffs enforced royal justice, maintained the king&#x27;s peace, collected royal revenue, and commanded the shire&#x27;s military forces.

Besides shire courts and hundred courts, private courts also existed. In the Anglo-Saxon period, the king created private courts in two ways. First, the king could grant the church (either the bishop of a diocese or the abbot of a religious house) the right to administer a hundred. The hundred&#x27;s reeve would then answer to the bishop or abbot. The same cases would be tried as before, but the profits of justice would now go to the church. The second way was to grant by writ or charter special rights to a landowner termed sake and soke. This was the right to hold a court with jurisdiction over his own lands, including infangthief (the power to punish thieves).

=== Norman government (1066–1154) ===

After the Norman Conquest of 1066, the king and his court or was the center of government. It was where he received counsel, heard complaints and petitions, settled important lawsuits, and conducted state trials. At certain times, the king enlarged the court by summoning large numbers of magnates (earls, barons, bishops and abbots) to attend a (Latin for &quot;great council&quot;) to discuss national business and promulgate legislation. Councils were important venues for building consensus for royal policy.

As Norman kings spent most of their time in Normandy, it became necessary to appoint agents to govern England in their absence. The chief justiciar functioned as the king&#x27;s chief minister and viceroy with particular responsibility over financial and legal matters. The chancellor oversaw the chancery, which was responsible for writing royal documents.

During the reign of Henry I (), the exchequer became the government&#x27;s primary financial department. The treasury at London became the lower exchequer or &quot;exchequer of receipt&quot;. It was staffed by the treasurer, two chamberlains, and other minor officials. Sheriffs paid county revenues to the lower exchequer. The upper exchequer consisted of the barons of the exchequer, who were selected from among court and household officials. The barons audited the sheriffs&#x27; accounts twice a year. When disputes arose over financial rights and obligations, the exchequer functioned as a court, the Court of the Exchequer.

Sheriffs remained in charge of royal administration in the counties (formerly shires), presiding over a hierarchy of bailiffs. Hundred and county courts, presided over by the sheriff or his bailiff, continued to meet as they had before the Conquest. Most disputes in these courts concerned land claims, violence, or theft. Certain cases called could only be heard by the king or his representative. So that royal pleas could be heard across the kingdom, the chief justiciar sent itinerant royal justices out to the counties.

The laws concerned with royal forests (i.e. royal hunting preserves) were adjudicated by forest courts, and jurisdiction over cases involving marriage, wills, legitimacy, and crimes committed by clerics were transferred to church courts. The lord of a manor automatically enjoyed the right to hold a manorial court—a departure from Anglo-Saxon tradition, which required royal grant to have sake and soke.

=== Angevin government (1154–1216) ===

Henry II () introduced the assize, a new form of legislation that clarified or altered custom by agreement between the king and his feudal tenants. 

The Assize of Clarendon of 1166 assigned royal justices to general eyres (circuits) to hear Crown pleas. Juries of presentment identified suspects, whose innocence or guilt was proven in a trial by ordeal. The Grand Assize of 1179 gave civil case defendants the option of having the matter settled by a jury of twelve knights instead of trial by battle. In 1215, the Fourth Lateran Council forbade clergy participation in trial by ordeal, and it was replaced in England by the jury trial.

Henry&#x27;s legal reforms mark the origins of the common law and improved the availability of royal justice. Petty assizes were procedures that allowed speedy resolution of land disputes. These include novel disseisin, mort d&#x27;ancestor, and darrein presentment. 

The growth of the legal system required specialization, and the judicial functions of the were delegated to two courts sitting at Westminster Hall. The Court of Common Pleas split from the Court of Exchequer in the 1190s. It had jurisdiction over ordinary civil cases (such as debts, property rights, and trespass). It was staffed by a chief justice of the Common Pleas and several other justices of the Common Pleas. The Court of King&#x27;s Bench had jurisdiction over Crown pleas. The King&#x27;s Bench could review decisions of the Common Pleas through writs of error. It had its own chief justice in addition to several justices of the King&#x27;s Bench.

Traditionally, the great council was not involved in levying taxes, but this changed as instances of extraordinary taxation increased. The likelihood of resistance made consent politically necessary. England was understood to be a (Latin for ) and the barons as its natural representatives. But this development created conflict between kings and the baronage as the latter attempted to defend what they considered the rights belonging to the king&#x27;s subjects.

==== Magna Carta ====

King John () needed large amounts of money to recover the lost continental possessions of the Angevin Empire, and his extortionate use of scutage, fines and amercements provoked baronial opposition. In 1215, about forty barons rose in revolt. A larger group of barons—around one hundred—worked with Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, to mediate a compromise that ultimately became Magna Carta. This was a charter of liberties that expressed what the barons believed to be their customary feudal rights. Magna Carta was based on three assumptions important to later constitutional development:

# the king was subject to the law 
# the king could only make law and raise taxation (except customary feudal dues) with the consent of the community of the realm
# that the obedience owed by subjects to the king was conditional and not absolute

While the clause stipulating no taxation &quot;without the common counsel&quot; was deleted from later reissues, it was nevertheless adhered to by later kings. Magna Carta transformed the magnates&#x27; feudal obligation to advise the king into a right to consent. While it was the barons who made the charter, the liberties guaranteed within it were granted to &quot;all the free men of our realm&quot;. None of the charter&#x27;s provisions applied to the unfree serfs that formed a majority of the English population.

Magna Carta was a paradox, as highlighted by constitutional scholar Ann Lyon:

Later kings would reconfirm Magna Carta, and later versions were enshrined in law. Overtime, Magna Carta gained the status of &quot;fundamental statute&quot;. The first three clauses have never been repealed:

# the English Church shall be free, and shall have its rights undiminished, and its liberties unimpaired;
# the city of London shall enjoy all its ancient liberties and free customs … all other cities, boroughs, towns and ports shall enjoy all their liberties and free customs;
# to no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice.

=== Parliamentary monarchy (1216–1399) ===
By 1237, the had formally split into two separate councils; though, they had long been separate in practice. The king&#x27;s council was &quot;permanent, advisory, and executive&quot;. It managed day to day government and included the king&#x27;s ministers and closest advisers. Parliament was the larger assembly of magnates that evolved out of the or great council. It met occasionally when summoned by the king. Parliament differed from the older magnate council by being &quot;an institution of the community rather than the crown&quot;. For the community of the realm, &quot;it acts as representative, approaching the government from without, and &#x27;parleying&#x27; with the king and his council&quot;.

Before 1258, legislation was not a major part of parliamentary business. The two major forms of legislation were enacted outside of Parliament. The first form, legislative , were administrative orders drafted by the king&#x27;s council and issued as letters patent or letters close. The second form, writs, were drafted by the chancery and issued in response to particular court cases. Technically, new writs needed consent from Parliament as much as other forms of legislation, but this was not always sought.

Parliament successfully asserted for itself the right to consent to taxation, and a pattern developed in which the king would make concessions (such as reaffirming Magna Carta) in return for grants of taxation. This was its main tool in disputes with the king. Nevertheless, this proved ineffective at restraining the king as he was still able to raise lesser amounts of revenue from sources that did not require parliamentary consent:

* county farms (the fixed sum paid annually by sheriffs for the privilege of administering and profiting from royal lands in their counties)
* profits from the eyre
* tallage on the royal demesne, the towns, foreign merchants, and most importantly English Jews
* scutage
* feudal dues and fines
* profits from wardship, escheat, and vacant episcopal sees

==== Baronial reform movement ====
The government of Henry III () was led by a succession of chief ministers who alienated the baronage by their accumulation of power and wealth for themselves and their families. At the Oxford Parliament of 1258, reform-minded barons forced a reluctant king to accept a constitutional framework known as the Provisions of Oxford. The reformers hoped that the provisions would ensure parliamentary approval for all major government acts. Under the provisions, Parliament was &quot;established formally (and no longer merely by custom) as the voice of the community&quot;.

The king defeated the reform party in the Second Barons&#x27; War, and the Provisions of Oxford were overturned. But the reign of Henry III was &quot;the beginnings of the transition from the king as an absolute and in a sense dictatorial ruler, to the concept of the king ruling through institutions, and of his ruling only while he retained the trust and confidence of his people.&quot;

==== Edwardian government ====
The reign of Edward I () saw the continued development of Parliament as an institution. Edward summoned parliaments regularly, generally twice a year at Easter in the spring and after Michaelmas in the autumn. As feudalism declined, the political community expanded. The shires and boroughs were recognised as communes (Latin ) with a unified constituency capable of being represented by knights of the shire and burgesses in Parliament.

In this period, law-making was still largely the prerogative of the monarch, and there was no difference between laws made in Parliament and laws made by the monarch alone. Outside of Parliament, the king could issue ordinances and writs that had the force of law. Furthermore, laws made in Parliament &quot;were not by the King in Parliament, but simply announced by the king or his ministers in a parliament.&quot;

The first major statutes amending the common law were passed, beginning with the Statute of Westminster in 1275. Edward&#x27;s legal reforms established the foundation of English land law, which was not significantly altered until 1925. For example, the Statute of Westminster of 1285 allowed for the creation of entails. Royal control over non-royal courts was also increased; the writ of limited the jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts to attacks on clerics and matrimonial, testamentary, and moral concerns.

Edward invaded Wales in 1276 and completed the conquest of Wales in 1283. The King himself took over the west and north of the country. The rest of Wales was divided between marcher lords. The Statute of Wales created a system of shires for northern Wales that were overseen by the Justiciar of North Wales. English criminal law was imposed, but Welsh law continued to apply in other areas of life. In 1301, the king gave his eldest son the title Prince of Wales with control of royal lands and rights in Wales (see Principality of Wales).

The Ordinances of 1311 were a series of regulations imposed on King Edward II by the Lords and higher clergy to restrict the power of the king.

Throughout the middle ages, common land was a source of welfare for common people, peasant labourers bound by a feudal system of control. In 1348, the Black Death struck England, and killed around a third of the population. As peasants lost their lords, and there was a shortage of workers, wages rose. The King and Parliament responded with the Statute of Labourers 1351 to freeze wage rises. This led to the Peasants’ Revolt of 1381, where leaders demanded an end to feudalism, and for everything to be held in common. Despite the revolt’s violent repression, slavery and serfdom broke down, yet most people remained without any substantial liberty, in political or economic rights.

As sheep farming became more profitable than agricultural work, enclosures of common land dispossessed more people, who turned into paupers and were punished.

=== Tudor dynasty ===
Under Henry VIII, to seal a divorce from Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn (who he soon beheaded for supposed infidelity), the Church of England was declared separate from Rome in the Act of Supremacy 1534, with the King as the head. The Law in Wales Act 1535 united Wales and England in one administrative system, while the King became ever more despotic, executing the Lord Chancellor, Sir Thomas More in 1535, and dissolving the monasteries and murdering those who resisted. After Henry VIII died, and power struggles following the death of his boy Edward VI at age 15, Elizabeth I, the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, took the throne in 1558. Half a century of prosperity followed as Elizabeth I largely avoided wars.

A second Act of Supremacy 1559 restored powers over the church to Elizabeth I, reversing Mary I&#x27;s catholic laws, and required all office-holders including the clergy to take an oath of allegiance acknowledging the Queen as the supreme governor of the Church of England. After the Spanish Armada was defeated in 1588, Its two levels of administration were the House of Lords, composed of influential peers of the realm and Lords Spiritual, and the House of Commons, which consisted of representative members of the aristocracy and the middle-class. Puritans in the House of Commons began demanding more rights, but their demands were ignored. James I would later have problems with them.

Before 1600, the Crown founded corporations including the East India Company to monopolise trade routes. Under her successor, James I, further companies were created to colonise North America, including the London Company and the Virginia Company in 1606, and the Massachusetts Bay Company in 1628. Many religious dissidents left England to settle the new world.

=== Stuart dynasty ===

While Elizabeth I maintained a protestant Church, under her successor James, who unified the Scottish and English Crowns, religious and political tensions grew as he asserted a divine right of Kings. In 1605, Guy Fawkes attempted to blow up Parliament, but was caught, tortured and executed. A wave of repression against catholics followed. James acceded to Puritan requests by commissioning the &quot;King James Bible&quot; in 1604, an English language translation and interpretation of the Bible completed in 1611. Possibly persuaded by his (secretly Catholic) wife, James exempted Catholics from paying tithes to the Anglican Church, but this caused a great decrease in Anglican Church revenue, so he quickly took those rights away.

The assertion of divine right prompted a series of cases from Sir Edward Coke, the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and then King&#x27;s Bench courts, which denied that the King could pass judgment in legal proceedings, and held that the royal prerogative was subject to the law and cannot be expanded. Coke CJ went even further in &quot;Dr Bonham&#x27;s case&quot;, holding that even that &quot;the common law will control Acts of Parliament&quot;. Though supported by some judges, the idea that common law courts could nullify Acts of Parliament was rejected, and the common law was formally placed under the King&#x27;s control in the &quot;Earl of Oxford’s case&quot;, establishing that equity (then administered by the Lord Chancellor in the House of Lords) was above common law. Coke fell from favour, and was removed from judicial office.

Traditionally, Parliament had voted at the beginning of a King&#x27;s reign on the amount allowed for a King&#x27;s Tonnage and Poundage, the customs duties (taxes on imported goods like wool and wine) that made up a large portion of a king&#x27;s annual income. Now Parliament wanted to re-evaluate these taxes annually, which would give it more control over the king. James I resisted this abrogation of his &#x27;Divine Right&#x27; and dealt with the situation by dissolving Parliament. Charles I did the same at first and later just ignored its annual evaluations.

When Charles I succeeded to the throne in 1625, and more fervently asserted a divine right, including the ability to levy tax without Parliament, particularly a Ship Money tax that required the counties bordering the sea to fund a navy to protect the English coastline. The coastal counties were unhappy as it was not actually used to fund the navy. Charles then placed the Ship Money tax on the interior counties as well. A London MP named John Hampden refused to pay this &quot;new,&quot; interior Ship Money tax, so he was tried for a crime by Charles I and was convicted with a vote of 7 to 5. This meant that 5 of 12 jurors were against their king, which did not look good or bode well for Charles I. Coke and others presented the Petition of Right 1628. This demanded the King to abide by Magna Carta, levy no tax without Parliament, not arbitrarily commit people to prison, not have martial law in times of peace, and not billet soldiers in private homes. As Charles I was at war with France and Spain, he signed the Petition of Right, but then responded by shutting down or proroguing Parliament and taxing trade (or &quot;ship money&quot;) without authority.

The country descended into the English Civil War in 1642 culminating in the capture and execution of King Charles I on Whitehall in 1649 by the New Model Army led by Oliver Cromwell. Cromwell, not wishing to become a King, became a &quot;de facto&quot; dictator. After his death, the monarchy was restored with Charles II in 1660, but his successor James II again attempted to assert divine right to rule. In 1688, Parliament &#x27;invited&#x27; a replacement King and Queen, William and Mary of Orange, and after a brief conflict forced James II out. 

Known as the Glorious Revolution, Parliament proclaimed a new Bill of Rights 1689, with a Claim of Right Act 1689 in Scotland, that cemented Parliamentary sovereignty. As well as reaffirming Magna Carta, it says the &#x27;pretended power of suspending laws or the execution of laws by regal authority without consent of Parliament is illegal’, that &#x27;election of members of Parliament ought to be free’, and that &#x27;Parliament ought to be held frequently&#x27;. The justification for government itself, encapsulated by John Locke in his &quot;Second Treatise on Government&quot; was the protection of people&#x27;s rights: &quot;lives, liberties and estates.&quot;

==== Civil War ====
William Laud and Thomas Wentworth were appointed to fill the void that the Duke of Buckingham left. On top of the wars England had with France and with Spain (both caused by the Duke of Buckingham), Charles I and William Laud (the Archbishop of Canterbury) began a war with Scotland in an attempt to convert Scotland to the Church of England (the Anglican Church). This was called the Bishops&#x27; War (1639–1640) and it had two major parts: The first Bishops&#x27; War (1639) ended in a truce. The second Bishops&#x27; War, the following year, began with the a Scottish invasion of England in which the Scottish defeated the English and remained stationed in England until their issues were solved. To get the Scottish out, Charles I signed the Treaty of Ripon (1640), which required England to pay an indemnity of £850 for each day that the Scottish were stationed in England.

During the second part of the Bishops&#x27; War, Charles I had run very low on money (since he was also fighting France and Spain), so he was forced to call a Parliament to make new taxes. He and the Parliament could not agree on anything, so after three weeks, Charles I dissolved the Parliament. Then he desperately needed new taxes, so Charles I called a Parliament again and it would only help him if he agreed to some terms, which ultimately made Charles I a constitutional monarch. It was called the Long Parliament (1640–1660), because it was not officially dissolved by its own vote until 1660.

These terms were:
* That Charles I had to impeach Thomas Wentworth and William Laud. He reluctantly placed them under arrest and put them in The Tower, executing Wentworth in 1641 (for which Charles I never forgave himself since he was close to Thomas Wentworth) and William Laud in 1645.
* Charles I had to agree to the Triennial Act (1641), which required the Parliament to meet every three years with or without the king&#x27;s consent.
* Charles I had to abolish the Court of the Star Chamber, a royal court controlled completely by Charles I in which the prosecutor was also the judge (which pretty much guaranteed a guilty verdict for the defendant) and it was intended to be used to implement the will of the king legally with a &quot;judicial&quot; façade. It was considered an &quot;extralegal&quot; court. It dealt with odd cases and punishments.
* Charles I had to abolish the High Court, which was the same as the Court of the Star Chamber, though it dealt with religious heresy. It was considered an &quot;extralegal&quot; court.
* Charles I had to accept the Grand Remonstrance and allow the circulation of its copies, and it was a document that outlined (hyperbolically) the crimes that officials had accused Charles of committing since the beginning of his reign. Charles I was also never to do any of those crimes again.
* Charles I, most importantly, had to agree never to dissolve a Parliament without the consent of the Parliament.

Most of England believed that Parliament had done enough to curb the power of King Charles I, but the radicals in Parliament (the extremist Puritans) and the radicals around the country (again, extremist Puritans) wanted to reform the Church of England by getting rid of the bishops (and all other things with the semblance of Catholicism) and by establishing the Puritans&#x27; method of worship as the standard. This caused a political division in Parliament, so Charles I took advantage of it. He then sent 500 soldiers into the House of Commons to arrest five of the Puritans&#x27; ringleaders (John Hampden included). The five ringleaders had been tipped off, so they had left Parliament and Charles I was left with only shame for storming Parliament.

King Charles I left London and went to Oxford, and the English Civil War began (1642). The North and West of England were on Charles I&#x27;s side (along with most of the Nobles and country gentry). They were known as the &quot;Cavaliers&quot;. Charles I created an army illegally (since he needed the Parliament&#x27;s consent).

The South and East of England were on Parliament&#x27;s side and were known as &quot;Roundheads&quot;, for their haircuts. In response to Charles I raising an army, they did so as well. Yet, they didn&#x27;t have the military might that King Charles I (and his nobles) had, so they solicited the help of the Scottish with the Solemn League and Covenant that promised to impose the Presbyterian religion on the Church of England. They called their army the New Model Army and they made its commander Oliver Cromwell, who was also a member of Parliament. The New Model Army was composed mostly of Presbyterians.

==== Cromwell and Commonwealth ====
Though Parliament won, it was clear to the Scots that it was not going to uphold the Solemn League and Covenant by imposing Presbyterianism on England (Puritanism wasn&#x27;t quite Presbyterian), so the New Model Army, Parliament and the Scots began falling apart. The Scots were paid for their help and sent back to Scotland.

The Presbyterian Roundheads were interested in freedom to practice their religion and not in making the Presbyterian religion the state religion.

Cromwell proposed that Parliament reinstate the bishops of the Church of England and King Charles I as a constitutional monarch, but allow for the toleration of other religions. Though at the end of the war, the people of England could accept Charles I back in office but not religious toleration. They also wanted the New Model Army dissolved since it was a provocative factor. Thus Parliament disallowed religious toleration and voted to disband the New Model Army, but the New Model Army refused the order.

Charles I then made the same deal that the Roundheads had made with the Scottish and Parliamentary Presbyterians. He solicited the help of Scotland (and the Presbyterians) and in return he promised to impose Presbyterianism on England. The New Model Army would not allow this deal to be made (because it would give Charles I military power once more). Thus a &quot;new&quot; civil war broke out in 1648.

This time, Scotland, the Parliamentary Presbyterians and the royalists were on the side of Charles I. The New Model Army and the rest of Parliament were against him.

In the Battle of Preston (1648) Cromwell and his New Model Army defeated Charles I.

Then one of Cromwell&#x27;s officers, Colonel Pride, destroyed the Presbyterian majority in Parliament by driving out of Parliament 143 Presbyterians of the 203 (leaving behind 60). The new Parliament constituted a Rump Parliament, which was a Parliament in which the minority (Presbyterians) carried on in the name of the majority that was kicked out. The Rump Parliament:
*Abolished the monarchy and the House of Lords in Parliament (it then executed Charles I after publicly trying him for crimes).
*Created a republic called the &quot;Commonwealth&quot; that was really just a dictatorship run by Cromwell.

Scotland was against Cromwell&#x27;s &quot;Commonwealth&quot; (Republic) and declared Charles I&#x27;s son king at Edinburgh as King Charles II, but Cromwell and the New Model Army defeated him (1650) and he fled to France where he stayed until 1660.

Cromwell then went to Ireland to govern it, but was &quot;disgusted&quot; with the Catholics, so he massacred many of them (in battle) and so the Irish rebelled against him as well. Cromwell then dissolved the Rump Parliament and declared himself to be the Lord Protector (dictator).

Cromwell died (1658) and was succeeded by his son Richard Cromwell, who tried to keep power militarily and absolutely, but he was also incapable of unifying all of the diverse groups (religious and ethnic). General George Monk came down from Scotland and overthrew Richard. He then invited the remnants of the Long Parliament (the Rump Parliament) to reconvene. The Long Parliament met and officially ended (in 1660, after being open since 1640) when it voted to dissolve itself and create a new Parliament. The new Parliament began the Restoration (of the monarchy) by choosing Charles I&#x27;s son Charles II to be the King of England.

==== Popular political movements ====
The idea of a political party with factions took form around the time of the Civil War. Soldiers from the Parliamentarian New Model Army and a faction of Levellers freely debated rights to political representation during the Putney Debates of 1647. The Levellers published a newspaper (The Moderate) and pioneered political petitions, pamphleteering and party colours. Later, the pre-war Royalist (then Cavalier) and opposing Parliamentarian groupings became the Tory party and the Whigs in the Parliament.

In 1649 Diggers, a small people&#x27;s political reform movement, published &quot;The True Levellers Standard Advanced: or, The State of Community opened, and Presented to the Sons of Men.&quot; The Diggers are sometimes called &quot;True Levellers&quot; to distinguish themselves from the larger political group called the Levellers, which had supported the republicans during the civil war. The Diggers were not satisfied with what had been gained by the war against the king and wanted instead a dismantling of the state. They can be best understood through such philosophies as libertarianism, anarchism, and religious communism.

Also at this time, the Polish Brethren arrived in England and Holland. The sect of Polish Brethren had been driven out of Poland after The Deluge because they were commonly considered to be collaborators with the Swedish.

The Diggers&#x27; radical ideas influenced thinkers in Poland, Holland, and England, playing an especially important role in the philosophy of John Locke. Locke, in turn, profoundly impacted the development of political ideas regarding liberty, which would later influence the Founding Fathers of the United States.

The Glorious Revolution was the overthrow of James II in 1688 and his replacement with William III and Mary II as joint monarchs. The Convention Parliament of 1689 drew up a Declaration of Right to address perceived abuses of government under James II and to secure the religion and liberties of Protestants. This was enacted by the Parliament of England as the Bill of Rights 1689, which limited royal power and reaffirmed certain civil rights, building on the Petition of Right 1628 and the Habeas Corpus Act 1679. The Parliament of Scotland approved it as the Claim of Right.

Both the Bill of Rights and the Claim of Right contributed a great deal to the establishment of the concept of parliamentary sovereignty and the curtailment of the powers of the monarch. Leading, ultimately, to the establishment of constitutional monarchy. They furthered the protection of the rule of law, which had started to become a principle of the way the country is governed.

=== Wales ===
Under the Statute of Wales, English criminal law replaced Welsh law in 1284. English civil law was imposed on Wales by Henry VIII&#x27;s series of Laws in Wales Acts between 1535 and 1542. The Laws in Wales Acts formally incorporated all of Wales within the Kingdom of England.

The Encyclopaedia of Wales notes that the Council of Wales and the Marches was created by Edward IV in 1471 as a household institution to manage the Prince of Wales&#x27;s lands and finances. In 1473, it was enlarged and given the additional duty of maintaining law and order in the Principality and the Marches of Wales. Its meetings appear to have been intermittent, but it was revived by Henry VII for his heir, Prince Arthur. The Council was placed on a statutory basis in 1543 and played a central role in co-ordinating law and administration. It declined in the early 17th century and was abolished by Parliament in 1641. It was revived at the Restoration before being finally abolished in 1689.

From 1689 to 1948 there was no differentiation between the government of England and government in Wales. All laws relating to England included Wales and Wales was considered by the British Government as an indivisible part of England within the United Kingdom. The first piece of legislation to relate specifically to Wales was the Sunday Closing (Wales) Act 1881. A further exception was the Welsh Church Act 1914, which disestablished the Church in Wales (which had formerly been part of the Church of England) in 1920.

In 1948 the practice was established that all laws passed in the Parliament of the United Kingdom were designated as applicable to either &quot;England and Wales&quot; or &quot;Scotland&quot;, thus returning a legal identity to Wales which had not existed for hundreds of years following the Act of Union with Scotland in 1707. Also in 1948 a new Council for Wales was established as a parliamentary committee. In 1964 the Welsh Office was established, based in London, to oversee and recommend improvements to the application of laws in Wales. This situation would continue until the devolution of government in Wales and the establishment of the autonomous National Assembly for Wales in 1998.

==Kingdom of Scotland==
From the fifth century AD, north Britain was divided into a series of petty kingdoms. Ferocious Viking raids beginning in AD 793 may have speeded up a long-term process of gaelicisation of the Pictish kingdoms, which adopted Gaelic language and customs. There was also a merger of the Gaelic and Pictish kingdoms. This culminated in the rise of Cínaed mac Ailpín (Kenneth MacAlpin) as &quot;king of the Picts&quot; in the 840s (traditionally dated to 843), which brought to power the House of Alpin. When he died as king of the combined kingdom in 900 one of his successors, Domnall II (Donald II), was the first man to be called &quot;rí Alban&quot; (King of Alba). 

The term Scotia was increasingly used to describe the heartland of these kings, north of the River Forth. Eventually the entire area controlled by its kings was referred to as Scotland. The long reign (900–942/3) of Donald&#x27;s successor Causantín (Constantine II) is often regarded as the key to formation of the Kingdom of Alba/Scotland. He was later credited with bringing Scottish Christianity into conformity with the Catholic Church.

Máel Coluim I (Malcolm I) (reigned c. 943–954) annexed Strathclyde, over which the kings of Alba had probably exercised some authority since the later ninth century. The reign of David I has been characterised as a &quot;Davidian Revolution&quot;, in which he introduced a system of feudal land tenure, established the first royal burghs in Scotland and the first recorded Scottish coinage, and continued a process of religious and legal reforms.

===Government===
The unified kingdom of Alba retained some of the ritual aspects of Pictish and Scottish kingship. These can be seen in the elaborate ritual coronation at the Stone of Scone at Scone Abbey.

While the Scottish monarchy in the Middle Ages was a largely itinerant institution, Scone remained one of its most important locations, with royal castles at Stirling and Perth becoming significant in the later Middle Ages before Edinburgh developed as a capital city in the second half of the fifteenth century.

The Crown remained the most important element of government, despite the many royal minorities. In the late Middle Ages, it saw much of the aggrandisement associated with the New Monarchs elsewhere in Europe. Theories of constitutional monarchy and resistance were articulated by Scots, particularly George Buchanan, in the sixteenth century, but James VI of Scotland advanced the theory of the divine right of kings, and these debates were restated in subsequent reigns and crises. The court remained at the centre of political life, and in the sixteenth century emerged as a major centre of display and artistic patronage, until it was effectively dissolved with the Union of the Crowns in 1603.

The Scottish Crown adopted the conventional offices of western European courts, including High Steward, Chamberlain, Lord High Constable, Earl Marischal and Lord Chancellor. The King&#x27;s Council emerged as a full-time body in the fifteenth century, increasingly dominated by laymen and critical to the administration of justice. The Privy Council, which developed in the mid-sixteenth century, and the great offices of state, including the chancellor, secretary and treasurer, remained central to the administration of the government, even after the departure of the Stuart monarchs to rule in England from 1603. However, it was often sidelined and was abolished after the Acts of Union 1707, with rule direct from London.

The Parliament of Scotland also emerged as a major legal institution, gaining an oversight of taxation and policy. By the end of the Middle Ages it was sitting almost every year, partly because of the frequent royal minorities and regencies of the period, which may have prevented it from being sidelined by the monarchy. In the early modern era, Parliament was also vital to the running of the country, providing laws and taxation, but it had fluctuating fortunes and was never as central to the national life as its counterpart in England.

In the early period the kings of the Scots depended on the great lords of the mormaers (later earls) and toísechs (later thanes), but from the reign of David I, sheriffdoms were introduced, which allowed more direct control and gradually limited the power of the major lordships. In the seventeenth century the creation of justices of the peace and the Commissioner of Supply helped to increase the effectiveness of local government. The continued existence of courts baron and introduction of kirk sessions helped consolidate the power of local lairds.

==United Kingdom development==
With Parliamentary sovereignty as the cornerstone of the new constitution, Parliament created a system of finance in the Bank of England Act 1694.

The Act of Settlement 1701 made several important reforms.

* Judges&#x27; commissions were for life (during &quot;good behavior&quot;), and a judge could be removed only by vote of both Houses of Parliament. (Previously, a judge served at the discretion of the Crown.)
* No person holding a paid office under the Crown or receiving a pension from the Crown could serve in the House of Commons.
* No Catholic, or spouse of a Catholic, could ever succeed to the Crown of England.
* The King or Queen of England must practice the Anglican religion.
* The succession to the Crown of England was settled on the nearest Protestant relatives of King William III and his expected successor Anne, who were childless. These were Electress Sophia of Hanover, and her son, who in 1714 succeeded as King George I.

In 1703, &quot;Ashby v White&quot; established that the right to vote was a constitutional right.

In April 1706, Scottish and English representatives began negotiations for union at Whitehall. The English proposed a combined parliament, to which Scotland would send 38 MPs and 16 peers, elected by Scottish peers at every new parliament. After the Scottish successfully negotiated an extra seven MPs, the proposals were brought before Queen Anne. The vote passed the Scottish Parliament 110 votes to 69 on 16 January 1707. The Acts of Union 1707 were passed by the English and Scottish Parliaments separately and on 1 May 1707, the two countries became formally united as Great Britain. This created a new parliament called the Parliament of Great Britain.

The Acts of Union also established a full economic union between England and Scotland. Scotland&#x27;s separate currency, taxes, and trade regulations were effectively abolished, while Scottish merchants gained complete access to England and its colonies. Scotland retain a separate legal system and judiciary.

The new union was soon faced with disaster as in the War of the Spanish Succession, the Spanish promised the right for British ships to trade (mostly slaves) in the seas around South America. The South Sea Company, duly incorporated to monopolise trade routes, became the object of mass financial speculation, provoked by government ministers interested in its rising share price. When it transpired, contrary to promoters&#x27; stories, that no trade was done because the Spanish had revoked their promise the stock market crashed, driving economic chaos. This was made worse by the decision of conservative politicians to endorse the company to take over the national debt as an alternative financier to the government over the Whig dominated Bank of England.

The result of the crash was that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was imprisoned in the Tower of London for his corruption, the Postmaster General committed suicide, and the disgraced Lord Chancellor was replaced with Lord King LC who promptly ruled that people in a position of trust must avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest. Out of the chaos, Robert Walpole emerged as a stable political figure who for 21 years held a majority of the House of Commons, and is now considered the first &quot;Prime Minister&quot;. Walpole chaired cabinet meetings, appointed all other ministers, and developed the doctrine of cabinet solidarity.

In 1765, the first teacher of English law, William Blackstone represented the standard view in his &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot; that slavery was unlawful and that &quot;the spirit of liberty is so deeply ingrained in our constitution&quot; any person enslaved in England must be freed. However, the transatlantic slave trade had accelerated to North American colonies. In 1772, when Lord Mansfield ruled in &quot;Somerset v Stewart&quot; that slavery was unlawful at common law, this set off a wave of outrage in southern, plantation colonies of America. Together with northern colonies grievances over taxation without representation, this led to the American Revolution and Declaration of Independence in 1776. The British military failed to hold control. Instead, it began settling Australia from 1788. 

In 1789, the French Revolution broke out, and the King was deposed with demands for &quot;liberty, equality and fraternity&quot;. The British aristocracy reacted with repression on free speech and association to forestall any similar movement. While figures like Jeremy Bentham called natural rights &quot;nonsense upon stilts&quot;, Mary Wollstonecraft called for &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; as well as men, arguing that unjust gender and class oppression flowed from &quot;the respect paid to property... as from a poisoned fountain&quot;. While successful in the Napoleonic wars in defeating France, and cementing union with Ireland in the Act of Union 1800, liberty, freedom and democracy were scarcely protected in the new &quot;United Kingdom&quot;.

==Political and industrial revolution==
During this time, with the invention of the steam engine the Industrial Revolution had begun. Poverty had also accelerated through the Speenhamland system of poor laws by subsidising employers and landowners with parish rates. The Corn Laws from 1815 further impoverished people by fixing prices to maintain landowner profits. While the Great Reform Act 1832 extended the vote slightly, only those with property had any representation in Parliament. Although the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 abolished the slave trade within the British Empire, it only compensated slave owners and made ex-slaves in colonies pay off debts for their freedom for decades after. With the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, further punishment for poverty was inflicted as people were put into work houses if found to be unemployed. In &quot;R v Lovelass&quot; a group of agricultural workers who formed a trade union were prosecuted and sentenced to be transported to Australia under the Unlawful Oaths Act 1797, triggering mass protests.

A movement called Chartism grew demanding the right to vote for everyone in free and fair elections. As the great famine hit Ireland and millions migrated to the United States, Chartists staged a mass march from Kennington Common to Parliament in 1848 as revolutions broke out across Europe, and the &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot; was drafted by German revolutionary Karl Marx and Manchester factory owner Friedrich Engels. While the Crimean War distracted from social reform and Viscount Palmerston opposed anything, the American Civil War of 1860 to 1865 ended slavery in the US, and the UK gradually enabled greater political freedom. 

In the Second Reform Act 1867 more middle class property owners were enfranchised, the Elementary Education Act 1870 provided free primary school, and the Trade Union Act 1871 enabled free association without criminal penalty. William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s UK Midlothian campaign between 1878-80 began the move towards modern political campaigning. The Representation of the People Act 1884 reduced the property qualification further, so that around one third of men could vote.

Outside the UK liberty and the right to vote were violently repressed across the vast British Empire, in Africa, India, Asia and the Caribbean.

==Social reform and war==

From the start of the 20th century, the UK underwent vast social and constitutional change, beginning with an attempt by the House of Lords to suppress trade union freedom. In response, the labour movement organised to support representatives in Parliament, and in the 1906 general election won 29 seats and supported the Liberal Party&#x27;s programme of reform. This included a legal guarantee of the right of unions to collectively bargain and strike for fair wages, an old age pension, a system of minimum wages, a People&#x27;s Budget with higher taxes on the wealthy to fund spending. After a further election brought by the House of Lords blocking reform, Parliament pass a National Insurance system for welfare, and the Parliament Act 1911 prevented the House of Lords blocking legislation for more than two years, and removed the right to delay any money bills. 

Despite this, the Liberal government, against the opposition of Labour, armed for and entered World War I. At the end of the War, with millions dead, Parliament passed the Representation of the People Act 1918 which enabled every adult male the vote, although it was only after the mass protest of the Suffragettes that the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928 enabled all women to vote, and that the UK became democratic. The War also triggered uprising in Ireland, and an Irish War of Independence leading to the partition of the island between the Republic of Ireland in the south and Northern Ireland in the Government of Ireland Act 1920. The Versailles Treaty at the end of the War demanded German reparations, beggaring the country through the 1920s and upon the Great Depression leading to a fascist collapse under Hitler.

===Irish independence and partition===

In 1912, the House of Lords managed to delay a Home Rule bill passed by the House of Commons. It was enacted as the Government of Ireland Act 1914. During these two years the threat of religious civil war hung over Ireland with the creation of the Unionist Ulster Volunteers opposed to the Act and their nationalist counterparts, the Irish Volunteers supporting the Act. The outbreak of World War I in 1914 put the crisis on political hold. A disorganized Easter Rising in 1916 was brutally suppressed by the British, which had the effect of galvanizing Catholic demands for independence. Prime Minister David Lloyd George failed to introduce Home Rule in 1918 and in the December 1918 General Election Sinn Féin won a majority of Irish seats.

Its MPs refused to take their seats at Westminster, instead choosing to sit in the First Dáil parliament in Dublin. A declaration of independence was ratified by Dáil Éireann, the self-declared Republic&#x27;s parliament in January 1919. An Anglo-Irish War was fought between Crown forces and the Irish Republican Army between January 1919 and June 1921. The war ended with the Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921 that established the Irish Free State. Six northern, predominantly Protestant counties became Northern Ireland and have remained part of the United Kingdom ever since, despite demands of the Catholic minority to unite with the Republic of Ireland. Britain officially adopted the name &quot;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot; by the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927.

==Post-war==
 

The failed international law system, after World War II was replaced with the United Nations where the UK held a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. However the British Empire began to crumble as India, Israel and nations across Africa fought for democracy, human rights, and independence. To prevent any recurrence of the Holocaust and war, the Council of Europe was established to draft the European Convention on Human Rights in 1950. Further it was seen that the only way to prevent conflict was through economic integration. The European Economic Community, which became the European Union in 1992, was supported by Winston Churchill with the UK to be &quot;at the centre&quot;, although it did not enter until the European Communities Act 1972.

Under Margaret Thatcher, significant cuts were made to public services, labour rights, and the powers of local government, including abolishing the Greater London Council. However some powers were restored with extensive devolution of power in the Scotland Act 1998, Northern Ireland Act 1998, Greater London Authority Act 1999 and the Government of Wales Act 2006. After many years of armed conflict in Northern Ireland, the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 brought peace.

The Life Peerages Act 1958 had allowed the creation of life peers which gave the Prime Minister the ability to change the composition of the House of Lords. The House of Lords Act 1999 reduced but did not fully eliminate hereditary peers.

An important change in constitutional law came about with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, which significantly altered the way in which parliament can be dissolved. Then, following a referendum on EU membership in 2016 that resulted in 52.89 per cent of people favouring to leave, the United Kingdom ceased to be a member of the European Union on 31 January 2020. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act, which had impeded resolution of the Brexit controversy in Parliament, was subsequently repealed by the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, reverting the constitutional situation to the &quot;status quo ante&quot;.

===Devolution===
In the First Blair ministry (1997–2001), Labour introduced a large package of constitutional reforms, which the party had promised in its 1997 manifesto. The most significant were:
*The creation of a devolved parliament in Scotland and assemblies in Wales and Northern Ireland, with their own direct elections.
*The creation of a devolved assembly in London and the associated post of a directly elected mayor.
*The beginning of a process of reform of the House of Lords, including the removal of all but 92 hereditary peers.
*The incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law by passing the Human Rights Act 1998.
*The passing of the Freedom of Information Act 2000.
*The passing of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, creating the Electoral Commission to regulate elections and referendums and party spending to an extent.
*The granting of independence over decisions about monetary policy including interest rates to the Bank of England.

The House of Commons voted on seven options in February 2003 on what proportion of elected and appointed members (from 100% elected to 100% appointed) the House of Lords should have. None of the options received a majority.

In 2004, a Joint Committee of the House of Commons and House of Lords tasked with overseeing the drafting of the Civil Contingencies Bill, published its first report, in which, among other things, it suggested amending the bill&#x27;s clauses that grant Cabinet Ministers the power &quot;to disapply or modify any Act of Parliament&quot; as overly wide, and that the bill should be modified to preclude changes to the following Acts, which, it suggested, formed &quot;the fundamental parts of constitutional law&quot; of the United Kingdom:

This amendment was defeated by the government and the bill was passed without it. However, the government partially one recommendation — the Human Rights Act 1998 may not be amended by emergency regulations.

The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 created the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and guarantees judicial independence.

===Coalition reforms===
The Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition introduced several reforms including the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010, which reformed the Royal Prerogative and made other significant changes; the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, which introduced fixed-term parliaments of 5 years.

A key Liberal Democrat policy was that of voting reform, to which a referendum took place in May 2011 on whether or not Britain should adopt a system of Alternative Vote to elect MPs to Westminster. However, the proposal was rejected overwhelmingly, with 68% of voters in favour of retaining first-past-the-post.

In late October 2011, the prime ministers of the Commonwealth realms voted to grant gender equality in the line of succession to the British throne, ending male-preference primogeniture. The amendment, once enacted, also ended the ban on the monarch marrying a Catholic. Following the Perth Agreement in 2011, legislation amending the Bill of Rights 1689 and the Act of Settlement 1701 came into effect across the Commonwealth realms on 26 March 2015 which changed the laws of succession to the British throne. In the United Kingdom, it was passed as the Succession to the Crown Act 2013.

===Further devolution===

Further powers were devolved under the Government of Wales Act 2006, Northern Ireland Act 2006, Northern Ireland Act 2009, Scotland Act 2012, Wales Act 2014, and the Scotland Act 2016. On 18 September, a referendum was held in Scotland on whether to leave the United Kingdom and become an independent country. The three UK-wide political parties - Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrats - campaigned together as part of the Better Together campaign while the pro-independence Scottish National Party was the main force in the Yes Scotland campaign, together with the Scottish Greens and the Scottish Socialist Party. Days before the vote, with the opinion polls closing, the three Better Together party leaders issued &#x27;The Vow&#x27;, a promise of more powers for Scotland in the event of a No vote. The referendum resulted in Scotland voting by 55% to 45% to remain part of the United Kingdom.

The Smith Commission was announced by Prime Minister David Cameron on 19 September 2014 to propose the powers that would be devolved to the Scottish Government. Once the recommendations had been published they were debated in the UK Parliament and a command paper was published in January 2015 putting forward draft legislative proposals. A Scottish Parliament committee report published in May 2015 said that this draft bill did not meet the recommendations of the Smith Commission, specifically in relation to welfare payments. A spokesman for the UK Government said that a full Parliamentary discussion would follow. A bill based on the Smith Commission&#x27;s recommendations was announced by the UK government in the May 2015 Queen&#x27;s Speech. The bill subsequently became law as the Scotland Act 2016 in March 2016.

===Accession to the EU and subsequent withdrawal===

On 20 February 2016, Prime Minister David Cameron announced that a referendum on the UK&#x27;s membership of the European Union would be held on 23 June 2016, following years of campaigning by eurosceptics. Debates and campaigns by parties supporting both &quot;Remain&quot; and &quot;Leave&quot; focused on concerns regarding trade and the single market, security, migration and sovereignty. The result of the referendum was in favour of the country leaving the EU with 51.9% of voters wanting to leave. The UK remains a member for the time being, but is expected to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which would begin negotiations on a withdrawal agreement that will last no more than two years (unless the Council and the UK agree to extend the negotiation period) which will ultimately lead to an exit from the European Union.

In October 2016 the prime minister, Theresa May, promised a &quot;Great Repeal Bill&quot; which would repeal the 1972 European Communities Act and import its regulations into UK law, with effect from the date of British withdrawal. The regulations could then be amended or repealed on a case-by-case basis.

The Supreme Court issued a ruling in January 2017 that an Act of Parliament is needed before the government can trigger to leave the European Union.

== Worldwide influence ==
Over its history, the British constitutional system had widespread influence around the world on the constitutional governance and legal systems of other countries, propagating the spread of the principles of the rule of law, parliamentary sovereignty and judicial independence.

Magna Carta and the Parliament of England influenced the history of democracy in the Middle Ages and the early history of parliamentarism. 

In the Thirteen Colonies, the Bill of Rights 1689 was one of the influences on the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights, which in turn influenced the United States Declaration of Independence later that year. The Constitution of the United States was adopted in 1789 and the United States Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791, both of which were influenced by British constitutional history.

Although not a comprehensive statement of civil and political liberties, the Bill of Rights 1689 stands as one of the landmark documents in the development of civil liberties in the United Kingdom and a model for later, more general, statements of rights, including the United States Bill of Rights, the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the European Convention on Human Rights. For example, as with the Bill of Rights 1689, the US Constitution prohibits excessive bail and &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot;. Similarly, &quot;cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&quot; is banned under Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Concepts developed through British constitutional history, such as protection of individual rights and habeas corpus, have influenced the legal and political systems of other nations around the world.

The modern system of parliament emerged with the Parliament of Great Britain (1707–1800), which contributed to the spread of parliamentarism. The idea of a parliamentary democracy, where the executive is accountable to the legislature and subject to its scrutiny, was replicated in various forms in Europe and around the world. In the 19th and 20th centuries, democratising countries often chose the British model of democracy; many countries that were once part of the British Empire, including Australia, Canada, India and various Commonwealth nations, adopted the Westminster parliamentary system, with its bicameral legislature and the concept of responsible government (see also Representation of the People Act). Thus the Parliament of the United Kingdom is often referred to as the &quot;Mother of Parliaments&quot; (in fact a misquotation of John Bright, who remarked in 1865 that &quot;England is the Mother of Parliaments&quot;) because the British Parliament has been the model for most other parliamentary systems, and its Acts have created many other parliaments.

English common law has served as the template for many countries and has been adopted, adapted, and incorporated into their legal systems. International commercial contracts are often based on English common law. The British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council still serves as the highest court of appeal for twelve former colonies.

One of the oldest constitutional systems in the world, dating back to the before the 11th century, it is characterised by the stability of its governing institutions and its capacity to absorb change.

==Key statutes==

Although there is no definitive list of constitutional statutes, there are certain statutes that are significant in the history of the Constitution of the United Kingdom. Some have been repealed, several have been amended and remain in statute, while others are current legislation as originally enacted. None are entrenched, but according to some theories (including &quot;obiter dicta&quot; in &quot;Thoburn v Sunderland City Council&quot;) they may be protected from implied repeal.

<text>In European history, the commercial revolution saw the development of a European economy – based on trade – which began in the 11th century AD and operated until the advent of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-18th century. Beginning with the Crusades, Europeans rediscovered spices, silks, and other commodities then rare in Europe. Consumer demand fostered more trade, and trade expanded in the second half of the Middle Ages (roughly 1000 to 1500 AD). Newly forming European states, through voyages of discovery, investigated alternative trade routes in the 15th and 16th centuries, which allowed European powers to build vast, new international trade networks. Nations also sought new sources of wealth and practiced mercantilism and colonialism. The Commercial Revolution is marked by an increase in general commerce, and in the growth of financial services such as banking, insurance, and investing.

==Origins of the commercial revolution==
The term itself was used by Karl Polanyi in his &quot;The Great Transformation: &quot;&quot;Politically, the centralized state was a new creation called forth by the Commercial Revolution...&quot;. Later the economic historian Roberto Sabatino Lopez, used it to shift focus away from the English Industrial Revolution. In his best-known book, &quot;The Commercial Revolution of the Middle Ages&quot; (1971, with numerous reprints), Lopez argued that the key contribution of the medieval period to European history was the creation of a commercial economy between the 11th and the 14th century, centered at first in the Italo-Byzantine eastern Mediterranean, but eventually extending to the Italian city-states and over the rest of Europe. This kind of economy ran from approximately the 14th century through the 18th century. Walt Whitman Rostow placed the beginning &quot;arbitrarily&quot; in 1488, the year the first European sailed around the Cape of Good Hope. Most historians, including scholars such as Robert Sabatino Lopez, Angeliki Laiou, Irving W. Raymond, and Peter Spufford indicate that there was a commercial revolution of the 11th through 13th centuries, or that it began at this point, rather than later.

===Maritime republics and communes===

Italy first felt huge economic changes in Europe from the 11th to the 13th centuries. Typically there was:
* a rise in population―the population doubled in this period (the demographic explosion)
* an emergence of large cities (Venice, Florence and Milan had over 100,000 inhabitants by the 13th century in addition to many others such as Genoa, Bologna and Verona, which had over 50,000 inhabitants)
* the rebuilding of the great cathedrals
* substantial migration from country to city (in Italy the rate of urbanization reached 20%, making it the most urbanized society in the world at that time)
* an agrarian revolution
* the development of commerce

In recent writing on the city states, American scholar Rodney Stark emphasizes that they married responsive government, Christianity and the birth of capitalism. He argues that Italy consisted of mostly independent towns, who prospered through commerce based on early capitalist principles and kept both direct Church control and imperial power at arm&#x27;s length.

Cambridge University historian and political philosopher Quentin Skinner has pointed out how Otto of Freising, a German bishop who visited central Italy during the 12th century, commented that Italian towns had appeared to have exited from feudalism, so that their society was based on merchants and commerce. Even northern cities and states were also notable for their maritime republics, especially the Republic of Venice and Genoa. Compared to absolutist monarchies or other more centrally controlled states, the Italian communes and commercial republics enjoyed relative political freedom conducive to academic and artistic advancement. Geographically, and because of trade, Italian cities such as Venice became international trading and banking hubs and intellectual crossroads.

Harvard historian Niall Ferguson points out that Florence and Venice, as well as several other Italian city-states, played a crucial innovative role in world financial developments, devising the main instruments and practices of banking and the emergence of new forms of social and economic organization.

It is estimated that the per capita income of northern Italy nearly tripled from the 11th century to the 15th century. This was a highly mobile, demographically expanding society, fueled by the rapidly expanding Renaissance commerce.

In the 14th century, just as the Italian Renaissance was beginning, Italy was the economic capital of Western Europe: the Italian States were the top manufacturers of finished woolen products. However, with the Black Death in 1348, the birth of the English woolen industry and general warfare, Italy temporarily lost its economic advantage. However, by the late 15th century Italy was again in control of trade along the Mediterranean Sea. It found a new niche in luxury items like ceramics, glassware, lace and silk as well as experiencing a temporary rebirth in the woolen industry.

During the 11th century in northern Italy a new political and social structure emerged: the city-state or commune. The civic culture which arose from this &quot;urbs&quot; was remarkable. In some places where communes arose (e.g. Britain and France), they were absorbed by the monarchical state as it emerged. They survived in northern and central Italy as in a handful of other regions throughout Europe to become independent and powerful city-states. In Italy the breakaway from their feudal overlords occurred in the late 12th century and 13th century, during the Investiture controversy between the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor: Milan led the Lombard cities against the Holy Roman Emperors and defeated them, gaining independence (battles of Legnano, 1176, and Parma, 1248; see Lombard League).

Similar town revolts led to the foundation of city-states throughout medieval Europe, such as in Russia (Novgorod Republic, 12th century), in Flanders (Battle of Golden Spurs, 14th century) in Switzerland (the towns of the Old Swiss Confederacy, 14th century), in Germany (the Hanseatic League, 14th–15th century), and in Prussia (Thirteen Years&#x27; War, 15th century).

Some Italian city-states became great military powers very early on. Venice and Genoa acquired vast naval empires in the Mediterranean and Black Seas, some of which threatened those of the growing Ottoman Empire. During the Fourth Crusade (1204), Venice conquered a quarter of the Byzantine Empire.

The Maritime Republics were one of the main products of this new civic and social culture based on commerce and exchange of knowledge with other areas of the world outside western Europe. The Republic of Ragusa and the Republic of Venice, for example, had important trade communications with the Muslim and Hindu world and this helped the initial development of the Italian Renaissance.

By the late 12th century, a new and remarkable society had emerged in Northern Italy, rich, mobile, and expanding, with a mixed aristocracy and urban &quot;borghese&quot; (burgher) class, interested in urban institutions and republican government. But many of the new city-states also housed violent factions based on family, confraternity and brotherhood, who undermined their cohesion (for instance the Guelphs and Ghibellines).

By 1300, most of these republics had become princely states dominated by a Signore. The exceptions were Venice, Florence, Lucca, and a few others, which remained republics in the face of an increasingly monarchic Europe. In many cases by 1400 the Signori were able to found a stable dynasty over their dominated city (or group of regional cities), obtaining also a nobility title of sovereignty by their formal superior, for example in 1395 Gian Galeazzo Visconti bought for 100,000 gold florins the title of Duke of Milan from the emperor Wenceslaus.

In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, Milan, Venice, and Florence were able to conquer other city-states, creating regional states. The 1454 Peace of Lodi ended their struggle for hegemony in Italy, attaining a balance of power and creating the conditions for the artistic and intellectual changes produced by the Italian Renaissance.

==Colonialism and mercantilism==
 The deterioration of the climate that brought about the end of the medieval warm period (or medieval weather anomaly) caused an economic decline at the beginning of the 14th century (see Great Famine). However, demographic expansion continued until the arrival of the Black Death epidemic in 1347, when ca. 50% of the European population was killed by the plague. The economic effects of a labor shortage actually caused wages to rise, while agricultural yields were once again able to support a diminished population. By the beginning of the 15th century, the economic expansion associated with the commercial revolution in earlier centuries returned in full force, aided by improvements in navigation and cartography.

Geopolitical, monetary, and technological factors drove the Age of Discovery. During this period (1450–17th century), the European economic center shifted from the Islamic Mediterranean to Western Europe (Portugal, Spain, France, the Netherlands, and to some extent England). This shift was caused by the successful circumnavigation of Africa, which opened up sea-trade with the east: after Portugal&#x27;s Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope and landed in Calicut, India in May 1498, a new path of eastern trade was possible, ending the monopoly of the Ottoman Turks and the Italian city-states. The wealth of the Indies was now open for the Europeans to explore; the Portuguese Empire was one of the early European empires to grow from spice trade. Following this, Portugal became the controlling state for trade between east and west, followed later by the Dutch city of Antwerp. Direct maritime trade between Europe and China started in the 16th century, after the Portuguese established the settlement of Goa, India in December 1510, and thereafter that of Macau in southern China in 1557. Since the English came late to the transatlantic trade, their commercial revolution was later as well.

===Geopolitical factors===
In 1453, the Ottoman Turks took over Constantinople, which cut off (or significantly increased the cost of) overland trade routes between Europe and the Far East, so alternative routes had to be found. English laws were changed to benefit the navy, but had commercial implications in terms of farming. These laws also contributed to the demise of the Hanseatic League, which traded in northern Europe. Because of the Reconquista, the Spanish had a warrior culture ready to conquer still more people and places, so Spain was perfectly positioned to develop their vast overseas empire.
Rivalry between the European powers produced intense competition for the creation of colonial empires, and fueled the rush to sail out of Europe.

===Monetary factors===
The need for silver coinage also affected the desire for expanded exploration as silver and gold were spent for trade to the Middle and Far East. The Europeans had a constant deficit in that silver and gold coin only went one way: out of Europe, spent on the very type of trade that they were now cut off from by the Ottomans.

Another issue was that European mines were exhausted of silver ore and gold. What ore remained was too deep to recover, as water would fill the mine, and technology was not sufficiently advanced enough to successfully remove the water to get to the ore or gold.

A second argument is that trade during the youth of the commercial revolution blossomed not due to explorations for bullion (gold and silver coinings) but due to a newfound faith in gold coinage. Italian city-states such as Genoa and Florence (where the first gold coins began to be minted in 1252) and kingdoms such as the Kingdom of Sicily routinely received gold through such trading partners as Tunisia and Senegal. A new, stable and universally accepted coinage that was both compatible with traditional European coinage systems and serviced the increased demand for currency to facilitate trade made it even more lucrative to carry out trade with the rest of the world.

===Technological factors===

From the 16th to 18th centuries, Europeans made remarkable maritime innovations. These innovations enabled them to expand overseas and set up colonies, most notably during the 16th and 17th centuries. They developed new sail arrangements for ships, skeleton-based shipbuilding, the Western &quot;galea&quot; (at the end of the 11th century), sophisticated navigational instruments, and detailed charts and maps.
After Isaac Newton published the &quot;Principia&quot;, navigation was transformed, because sailors could predict the motion of the moon and other celestial objects using Newton&#x27;s theories of motion. Starting in 1670, the entire world was measured using essentially modern latitude instruments. In 1676, the British Parliament declared that navigation was the greatest scientific problem of the age and in 1714 offered a substantial financial prize for the solution to finding longitude. This spurred the development of the marine chronometer, the lunar distance method and the invention of the octant after 1730. By the late 18th century, navigators replaced their prior instruments with octants and sextants.

===Important people===
Significant contributors to European exploration include Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal, who was the first of the Europeans to venture out into the Atlantic Ocean, in 1420. Others are Bartolomeu Dias, who first rounded the Cape of Good Hope; Vasco da Gama, who sailed directly to India from Portugal; Ferdinand Magellan, the first to circumnavigate the Earth; Christopher Columbus, who significantly encountered the Americas; Jacques Cartier, who sailed for France, looking for the Northwest Passage; and others.

===Key Features===
The economy of the Roman Empire had been based on money, but after the Empire&#x27;s fall, money became scarce; power and wealth became strictly land based, and local fiefs were (at least theoretically) self-sufficient. Because trade was dangerous and expensive, there were not many traders, and not much trade. The scarcity of money did not help; however, the European economic system had begun to change in the 14th century, partially as a result of the Black Death, and the Crusades.

Banks, stock exchanges, and insurance became ways to manage the risk involved in the renewed trade. New laws came into being. Travel became safer as nations developed. Economic theories began to develop in light of all of the new trading activity. The commercial revolution is also marked by the formalization of pre-existing, informal methods of dealing with trade and commerce.

===Inflation===

Spain legally amassed approximately 180 tons of gold and 8200 tons of silver through its endeavors in the New World, and another unknown amount through smuggling, spending this money to finance wars and the arts. The spent silver, suddenly being spread throughout a previously cash starved Europe, caused widespread inflation. The inflation was worsened by a growing population but a static production level, low employee salaries and a rising cost of living. This problem, combined with underpopulation (caused by the Black Death), affected the system of agriculture. The landholding aristocracy suffered under the inflation, since they depended on paying small, fixed wages to peasant tenants that were becoming able to demand higher wages. The aristocracy made failed attempts to counteract this situation by creating short-term leases of their lands to allow periodic revaluation of rent. The manorial system (manor system of lord and peasant tenant) eventually vanished, and the landholding aristocrats were forced to sell pieces of their land to maintain their style of living. Such sales transferred ownership to wealthy commoners, who wanted to buy land and thereby increase their social status. Former &quot;common lands&quot; were fenced by the landed gentry, a process known as &quot;enclosure&quot; which subsidized the cost of raising livestock (mainly sheep&#x27;s wool for the textile industry). This &quot;enclosure&quot; forced the peasants out of rural areas and into the cities, resulting in urbanization. The increase in the availability of silver coin allowed for commerce to expand in numerous ways.

===Banks===
Various legal and religious developments in the late Middle Ages allowed for development of the modern banking system at the beginning of the 16th century. Interest was allowed to be charged, and profits generated from holding other people&#x27;s money.

Banks in the Italian Peninsula had great difficulty operating at the end of the 14th century, for lack of silver and gold coin. Nevertheless, by the later 16th century, enough bullion was available that many more people could keep a small amount hoarded and used as capital.

In response to this extra available money, northern European banking interests came along; among them was the Fugger family. The Fuggers were originally weavers and cloth merchants, but soon became involved in banking, charging interest, and other financial activities. They dealt with everyone, from small-time individuals, to the highest nobility. Their banks even loaned to the emperors and kings, eventually going bankrupt when their clients defaulted. This family, and other individuals, used Italian methods which outpaced the Hanseatic League&#x27;s ability to keep up with the changes occurring in northern Europe.

Antwerp had one of the first money exchanges in Europe, a Bourse, where people could change currency. After the Siege of Antwerp (1584-1585), the majority of business transactions were moved to Amsterdam. The Bank of Amsterdam, following the example of a private Stockholm corporation, began issuing paper money to lessen the difficulty of trade, replacing metal (coin and bullion) in exchanges. In 1609 the &quot;Amsterdamsche Wisselbank&quot; (Amsterdam Exchange Bank) was founded which made Amsterdam the financial center of the world until the Industrial Revolution. In a notable example of crossover between stock companies and banks, the Bank of England, which opened in 1694, was a joint-stock company.

Banking offices were usually located near centers of trade, and in the late 17th century, the largest centers for commerce were the ports of Amsterdam, London, and Hamburg. Individuals could participate in the lucrative East India trade by purchasing bills of credit from these banks, but the price they received for commodities was dependent on the ships returning (which often did not happen on time) and on the cargo they carried (which often was not according to plan). The commodities market was very volatile for this reason, and also because of the many wars that led to cargo seizures and loss of ships.

===Managing risk===
Trade in this period was a risky business: war, weather, and other uncertainties often kept merchants from making a profit, and frequently an entire cargo would disappear all together. To mitigate this risk, the wealthy got together to share the risk through stock: people would own shares of a venture, so that if there was a loss, it would not be an all consuming loss costing the individual investor everything in one transaction.

Other ways of dealing with the risk and expense associated with all of the new trade activity include insurance and joint stock companies which were created as formal institutions. People had been informally sharing risk for hundreds of years, but the formal ways they were now sharing risk was new.

Even though the ruling classes would not often directly assist in trade endeavors, and individuals were unequal to the task, rulers such as Henry VIII of England established a permanent Royal Navy, with the intention of reducing piracy, and protecting English shipping.

====Joint stock companies and stock exchanges====

Stock exchanges were developed as the volume of stock transactions increased. The London Royal Exchange established in 1565 first developed as a securities market, though by 1801 it had become a stock exchange.

Historian Fernand Braudel suggests that in Cairo in the 11th-century Muslim and Jewish merchants had already set up every form of trade association and had knowledge of every method of credit and payment, disproving the belief that these were invented later by Italians. In 12th century France the &quot;courratiers de change&quot; were concerned with managing and regulating the debts of agricultural communities on behalf of the banks. Because these men also traded with debts, they could be called the first brokers. In late 13th century Bruges commodity traders gathered inside the house of a man called &quot;Van der Beurse&quot;, and in 1309 they became the &quot;Bruges Beurse&quot;, institutionalizing what had been, until then, an informal meeting. The idea quickly spread around Flanders and neighboring counties and &quot;Beurzen&quot; soon opened in Ghent and Amsterdam.

&quot;In the middle of the 13th century Venetian bankers began to trade in government securities. In 1351 the Venetian government outlawed spreading rumors intended to lower the price of government funds.&quot; Bankers in Pisa, Verona, Genoa and Florence also began trading in government securities during the 14th century. This practice was only possible, because these independent city states were not ruled by a duke but a council of influential citizens. The Dutch later started joint stock companies, which let shareholders invest in business ventures and get a share of their profits – or losses. In 1602, the Dutch East India Company issued the first shares on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. It was the first company to issue stocks and bonds.

The Amsterdam Stock Exchange (or Amsterdam Beurs) is also said to have been the first stock exchange to introduce continuous trade in the early 17th century. The Dutch &quot;pioneered short selling, option trading, debt-equity swaps, merchant banking, unit trusts and other speculative instruments, much as we know them.&quot;

====Insurance companies====

Insurance companies were another way to mitigate risk. Insurance in one form or another has been around as far back as there are records. What differed about insurance going into the 16th and 17th centuries was that these informal mechanisms became formalized.

Lloyd&#x27;s of London came into being in 1688 in English coffee shops that catered to sailors, traders, and others involved in trade. Lloyd&#x27;s coffeehouse published a newspaper, which gave news from various parts of the world, and helped the underwriters of the insurance at the coffeehouse to determine the risk. This innovation was one of many that allowed for the categorization of risk. Another innovation was the use of ship catalogs and classifications.

Other forms of insurance began to appear as well. After the Great Fire of London, Nicholas Barbon began to sell fire insurance in 1667.

Laws were changed to deal with insurance issues, such as &quot;l&#x27;Ordonnance de la Marine&quot; (by Colbert in 1681).

===Economic theory===
As the economy grew through the commercial revolution, so did attempts to understand and influence it. Economic theory as a separate subject of its own came into being as the stresses of the new global order brought about two opposing theories of how a nation accumulates wealth: mercantilistic and free-trade policies. Mercantilism inflamed the growing hostilities between the increasingly centralized European powers as the accumulation of precious metals by governments was seen as important to the prestige and power of a modern nation. This involvement in accumulating gold and silver (among other things) became important in the development of the nation-state. Governments&#x27; involvement in trade affected the nobility of western European nations, because increased wealth by non-nobles threatened the nobility&#x27;s place in society (citation needed).

===Trade monopolies===
Governments became involved in trade directly through the granting of royal trade monopolies. For example, Walter Raleigh had been granted a trade monopoly by Queen Elizabeth, for the export of broadcloth and wine. Ironically, competition between colonial powers led to their granting of trade monopolies to the East India Companies.

===Triangular trade===
A triangular trade occurred in this period: between Africa, North and South America, and Europe; and it worked in the following way: Slaves came from Africa, and went to the Americas; raw materials came from the Americas and went to Europe; from there, finished goods came from Europe and were sold back to the Americas at a much higher price.

Due the massive die-off of the indigenous people, the Americas had a local deficit of labor required for the extraction of resources (such as gold and silver) and farming. Europe was also recovering from the Black Plague and its resurgences, and population growth was slowed by intermittent warfare by European nations among themselves and against the Ottoman Empire. As a result of these limitations, the colonial powers were unable to satisfy the labor shortage through emigration, and the Atlantic Slave Trade was established to import the labor. This can be contrasted with the Qing dynasty&#x27;s colonization of Inner Asia, whereby the high population in China proper produced policies that encouraged Han resettlement in Dzungaria during the 18th century, and Inner Mongolia and Manchuria during the 19th century.

==Law==
Laws began to change to deal with commerce, both internationally, and locally within individual countries.

In France, for example, the Ordinance of Marine of Louis XIV was published under the auspices of Colbert in 1691, and was the first complete code of maritime and commercial law; and &quot;when we consider the originality and extent of the design and the ability with which it is executed, we shall not hesitate to admit that it deserves to be ranked among the noblest works that legislative genius and learning have ever accomplished.&quot;
In England, the Navigation Acts were among the British effort to regulate trade.

==Effects==
The commercial revolution, coupled with other changes in the early modern period, had dramatic effects on the globe.

For more than 2000 years the Mediterranean Sea had been the focus of European trade with other parts of the world. This focus shifted to the Atlantic Ocean by routes south around the Cape of Good Hope after 1488, and by trans-Atlantic trade after 1492. Older overland trade routes such as the Silk Road suffered economic decline due to the new maritime competition.

Christopher Columbus and the conquistadors, through their travels, were indirectly responsible for the massive depopulation of South America. They conquered the Inca, Aztec, and Maya peoples and incorporated their territories into the Spanish Empire. Other Europeans similarly affected the peoples of North America as well.

An equally important consequence of the commercial revolution was the Columbian Exchange. Plants and animals moved throughout the world due to human movements. For example, Yellow fever, previously unknown in North and South America, was imported through water that ships took on in Africa. Cocoa (chocolate), coffee, maize, cassava, and potatoes moved from one hemisphere to the other. Better food and more wealth allowed for larger families. The migration of peoples from Europe to the Americas allowed for European populations to increase. Higher caloric yields of the New World staple crops reduced the percentage of the workforce engaged in agricultural labor and accelerated urbanization.

Europe&#x27;s commercial revolution also created a foundation of wealth needed for the Industrial Revolution. The expanding labor force was also redirected into nascent industrialization. Economic prosperity financed new forms of cultural expression during this period.

<doc id="144575" wikidata="Q1685019" url="?curid=144575" title="José Torres (boxer)">
<text>José Louis &quot;Chegüi&quot; Torres (May 3, 1936 – January 19, 2009) was a Puerto Rican-born professional boxer who fought representing the United States. As an amateur boxer, he won a silver medal in the middleweight division at the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne. In 1965, he defeated Willie Pastrano to win the WBC, WBA, and lineal light-heavyweight championships. Torres trained with the legendary boxing trainer Cus D&#x27;Amato. In 1997, he was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

==Amateur career==
Born in the city of Ponce, Puerto Rico, Torres began boxing when he joined the United States Army as a teenager (he was 17 years old). His only amateur titles had come in Army and Inter-Service championships, several of which he had won. Torres was still in the Army when he won the silver medal in the light-middleweight division at the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games, losing to László Papp of Hungary in the final.

Torres trained at the Empire Sporting Club in New York City with trainer Cus D&#x27;Amato.

He was the 1958 National AAU Middleweight Champion and also won the 1958 New York Golden Gloves 160 lb Open Championship.

==Professional career==
He professionally debuted in 1958 with a first-round knockout of George Hamilton in New York. Twelve wins in a row followed, ten of them by knockout (including wins over contenders Ike Jenkins and Al Andrews). Afterward, he made his San Juan debut against Benny Paret, a future world welterweight champion from Cuba, in which Torres and Paret fought to a ten-round draw. In 1960, Torres went back to campaigning in New York, where he scored three wins that year, all by decision, including two over Randy Sandy.

In 1961, Torres made his hometown debut with a four-round knockout win in a rematch with Hamilton at Ponce. He had six more fights that year, winning all of them by knockout.

Torres kept his knockout streak alive through 1962 with three more knockout wins but, in 1963, he suffered his first loss, being stopped in five by Cuba&#x27;s Florentino Fernández, the only boxer ever to beat Torres by a knockout as a professional. After that setback, Torres went back to training and had one more fight that year. That time around, he was able to beat another top contender in Don Fullmer, Gene Fullmer&#x27;s brother, with a ten-round decision win in New Jersey.

In 1964, Torres beat a group of name boxers, including Jose Gonzalez, Walker Simmons (twice), Frankie Olivera, Gomeo Brennan, and former world Middleweight champion Carl (&quot;Bobo&quot;) Olson, who was taken out in one round. After this, Torres was ranked number one among Light-Heavyweight challengers.

His title shot arrived in 1965 at Madison Square Garden. Torres defeated the International Boxing Hall Of Fame member and World Light Heavyweight champion Willie Pastrano. In doing so, Torres became the third Puerto Rican world boxing champion in history and the first Latin American to win the world Light Heavyweight title, knocking Pastrano out in round nine. Later that year, he fought a non-title bout versus Tom McNeeley (father of former Mike Tyson rival, Peter McNeeley) in San Juan, winning a ten-round decision.

In 1966, he successfully defended his crown three times, with 15-round decisions over Wayne Thornton and Eddie Cotton and a two-round knockout of Chic Calderwood. In his next defense, however, he would lose it to another Hall Of Fame member, Nigeria&#x27;s Dick Tiger, by a decision in 15 rounds.

In 1967, he and Tiger had a rematch, with Torres losing a 15-round decision again. Many fans thought he should have won it that time, and as a consequence, a large riot followed the fight.

After his second defeat to Tiger, Torres only fought twice more (against Bob Dunlop in 1968 and Charlie &quot;The Devil&quot; Green in 1969), retiring after 1969.

==An active retirement==
In his years after retiring from boxing, he became a representative of the Puerto Rican community in New York, meeting political leaders, giving lectures, and becoming the New York State Athletic Commission&#x27;s Commissioner from 1984 to 1988. In 1986, he was chosen to sing the United States National Anthem before the World Lightweight championship bout between Jimmy Paul and Irleis Perez in Atlantic City, New Jersey. In 1990, he became President of the WBO until 1995. He was also a member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

==Author==
Torres regularly contributed a column to the &quot;New York Post&quot; (which he obtained with the help of his friend, Pete Hamill), as well as to &quot;El Diario La Prensa&quot;, a Spanish language newspaper in New York City. He also wrote for The Village Voice. In 1971, he co-authored &quot;Sting Like a Bee&quot;, a biography of Muhammad Ali. In 1989, he wrote the Mike Tyson biography &quot;Fire and Fear: The Inside Story of Mike Tyson&quot; (which would be adapted into the 1995-HBO television movie, &quot;Tyson&quot;).

==Later years==
In 2007, Torres announced his decision to move back to his hometown of Ponce, Puerto Rico and concentrate on writing books and articles related to sports and history. On August 6, 2008, Torres received a recognition for his military career.

==Death and legacy==
Torres died in the morning of January 19, 2009, of a heart attack at his home in Ponce. There are plans to move his remains to the Panteón Nacional Román Baldorioty de Castro, a national pantheon (and cemetery) and museum, in Ponce, Puerto Rico. He is also recognized at Ponce&#x27;s Parque de los Ponceños Ilustres in the area of sports. During his life, Torres was the subject of two documentaries by famed Japanese film director, Hiroshi Teshigahara.

<doc id="144585" wikidata="Q28934873" url="?curid=144585" title="Frith">
<text>Frith is a word derived from Old English meaning &quot;peace; protection; safety, security, freedom, refuge&quot;.

== Etymology ==
Derived from Old English &quot;friðu, friþ&quot;, it is cognate to Old Norse &quot;friðr&quot;, Old Saxon &quot;frithu&quot;, Old High German &quot;fridu&quot;, German &quot;Friede&quot;, Dutch &quot;vrede&quot;, West Frisian &quot;frede&quot;, Luxembourgish
&quot;Fridden&quot;, Icelandic &quot;friður&quot;, Common Scandinavian &quot;fred&quot; (all with meanings similar to &quot;peace&quot; or &quot;calm&quot;) and also root-cognate to &quot;friend&quot;.

In Swedish, two different words with different meanings have developed from this word, the words &quot;fred&quot; (state of no war) and &quot;frid&quot; (state of no disturbance) and also the expression that something is &quot;fredat/fredad&quot; more or less &quot;peaced&quot; denoting things that are not to be touched such as animals not to be hunted or flowers not to be picked. The English word became obsolete in the Middle English period, but survived into the 17th century in the compound &quot;frith-silver&quot; &quot;feudal payment&quot;.
== Culture ==
In Anglo-Saxon and post-Anglo-Saxon culture, the term has a considerably broader scope and meaning. &quot;Frith&quot; has a great deal to do not only with the state of peace but also with the nature of social relationships conducive to peace. Moreover, it has strong associations with stability and security.

The word &quot;friþgeard,&quot; meaning &quot;asylum, sanctuary&quot; was used for sacrosanct areas. A &quot;friþgeard&quot; would then be any enclosed area given over to the worship of the gods. Seating oneself on a &quot;frith-stool&quot; was sometimes a requirement for claiming sanctuary in certain English churches.

&quot;Frith&quot; is also used in the context of fealty, as an expression of the relationship between a lord and his people.
&quot;Frith&quot; is inextricably related to the state of kinship, which is perhaps the strongest indicator of &quot;frith&quot;. In this respect, the word can be coterminous with another significant Anglo-Saxon root-word, &quot;sib&quot; (from which the word &#x27;sibling&#x27; is derived) - indeed the two are frequently interchanged. In this context, &quot;frith&quot; goes further than expressing blood ties, and encompasses all the concomitant benefits and duties which kinship engenders.

As early as the rule of Æthelstan in 930 AD, &quot;frith-guilds&quot; were responsible for maintaining the peace under law in England, particularly in London. Later, this concept expanded to a sort of mutual defence, such as in Berwick-upon-Tweed.

In the post-conquest poem &quot;Rime of King William&quot;, a &quot;deorfrið&quot; (literally animal-&quot;frith&quot;) referred to one of the royal forests set up by William the Conqueror, probably the New Forest. Stefan Jurasinski argued that &quot;frið&quot; here could have carried the legal notion of protection (Latin: &quot;pax&quot;).

<text>Information warfare (IW) is the battlespace use and management of information and communication technology (ICT) in pursuit of a competitive advantage over an opponent. It is different from &quot;cyberwarfare&quot; that attacks computers, software, and command control systems. Information warfare is the manipulation of information trusted by a target without the target&#x27;s awareness so that the target will make decisions against their interest but in the interest of the one conducting information warfare. As a result, it is not clear when information warfare begins, ends, and how strong or destructive it is.

Information warfare may involve the collection of tactical information, assurance(s) that one&#x27;s information is valid, spreading of propaganda or disinformation to demoralize or manipulate the enemy and the public, undermining the quality of the opposing force&#x27;s information, and denial of information-collection opportunities to opposing forces. Information warfare is closely linked to psychological warfare.

The United States Armed Forces&#x27; use of the term favors technology and hence tends to extend into the realms of electronic warfare, cyberwarfare, information assurance and computer network operations, attack, and defense. Other militaries use the much broader term &quot;information operations&quot; which, although making use of technology, focuses on the more human-related aspects of information use, including (amongst many others) social network analysis, decision analysis, and the human aspects of command and control.

==Overview==
Information warfare has been described as &quot;the use of information to achieve our national objectives.&quot; According to NATO, &quot;Information war is an operation conducted in order to gain an information advantage over the opponent.&quot;

Information warfare can take many forms:
* Television, internet and radio transmission(s) can be jammed to disrupt communications, or hijacked for a disinformation campaign.
* Logistics networks can be disabled.
* Enemy communications networks can be disabled or spoofed, especially online social communities in modern days.
* Stock exchange transactions can be sabotaged, either with electronic intervention, by leaking sensitive information or by placing disinformation.
* The use of drones and other surveillance robots or webcams.
* Communication management
* Synthetic media 
* The organized use of social media and other online content-generation platforms can be used to influence public perceptions.

The United States Air Force has had Information Warfare Squadrons since the 1980s. In fact, the official mission of the U.S. Air Force is now &quot;To fly, fight and win... in air, space and cyberspace&quot;, with the latter referring to its information warfare role.

As the U.S. Air Force often risks aircraft and aircrews to attack strategic enemy communications targets, remotely disabling such targets using software and other means can provide a safer alternative. In addition, disabling such networks electronically (instead of explosively) also allows them to be quickly re-enabled after the enemy territory is occupied. Similarly, counter-information warfare units are employed to deny such capability to the enemy. The first application of these techniques was used against Iraqi communications networks in the Gulf War.

Also during the Gulf War, Dutch hackers allegedly stole information about U.S. troop movements from U.S. Defense Department computers and tried to sell it to the Iraqis, who thought it was a hoax and turned it down. In January 1999, U.S. Air Intelligence computers were hit by a coordinated attack (Moonlight Maze), part of which came from a Russian mainframe. This could not be confirmed as a Russian cyber attack due to non-attribution – the principle that online identity may not serve as proof of real-world identity.

==New battlefield==
Within the realm of cyberspace, there are two primary weapons: network-centric warfare and C4ISR, which denotes integrated Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance. Furthermore, cyberspace attacks initiated by one nation against another nation have an underlying goal of gaining information superiority over the attacked party, which includes disrupting or denying the victimized party&#x27;s ability to gather and distribute information. A real-world occurrence that illustrated the dangerous potential of cyberattacks transpired in 2007, when a strike from Israeli forces demolished an alleged nuclear reactor in Syria that was being constructed via a collaborative effort between Syria and North Korea. Accompanied by the strike was a cyberattack on Syria&#x27;s air defenses, which left them blind to the attack on the nuclear reactor and, ultimately allowed for the attack to occur (New York Times 2014). An example of a more basic attack on a nation within cyberspace is a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack, which is utilized to hinder networks or websites until they lose their primary functionality. As implied, cyberattacks do not just affect the military party being attacked, but rather the whole population of the victimized nation. Since more aspects of daily life are being integrated into networks in cyberspace, civilian populations can potentially be negatively affected during wartime. For example, if a nation chose to attack another nation&#x27;s power grid servers in a specific area to disrupt communications, civilians and businesses in that area would also have to deal with power outages, which could potentially lead to economic disruptions as well.

Moreover, physical ICTs have also been implemented into the latest revolution in military affairs by deploying new, more autonomous robots (i.e. – unmanned drones) into the battlefield to carry out duties such as patrolling borders and attacking ground targets. Humans from remote locations pilot many of the unmanned drones, however, some of the more advanced robots, such as the Northrop Grumman X-47B, are capable of autonomous decisions. Despite piloting drones from remote locations, a proportion of drone pilots still suffer from stress factors of more traditional warfare. According to NPR, a study performed by the Pentagon in 2011 found that 29% of drone pilots are &quot;burned out&quot; and undergo high levels of stress. Furthermore, approximately 17% of the drone pilots surveyed as the study were labeled &quot;clinically distressed&quot; with some of those pilots also showing signs of post-traumatic stress disorder.

Modern ICTs have also brought advancements to communications management among military forces. Communication is a vital aspect of war for any involved party and, through the implementation of new ICTs such as data-enabled devices, military forces are now able to disseminate information faster than ever before. For example, some militaries are now employing the use of iPhones to upload data and information gathered by drones in the same area.

==Notable examples==
=== Chinese information warfare ===
===Russo-Ukrainian War===
In 2022, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have taken advantage of deficiencies in Russian communications by allowing them to piggyback on Ukrainian networks, connect, and communicate. Ukrainian forces then eavesdrop, and cut off Russian communications at a crucial part of the conversation.

To build support before it invaded Ukraine, Russia perpetuated a narrative that claimed the Ukrainian government was committing violence against its own Russian speaking population. By publishing large amounts of disinformation on the internet, the alternate narrative was picked up in search results, such as Google News.

=== Russian interference in foreign elections ===
Russian interference in foreign elections, most notably the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, has been described as information warfare. Russia has also begun to interfere in the 2024 US presidential elections according to Microsoft. According to NBC, Russia is conducting disinformation campaigns in the 2024 US elections against US president, Joe Biden.

=== Russia vs West ===
Research suggests that Russia and the West are also engaged in an information war. For instance, Russia believes that the West is undermining its leader through the encouragement of overthrowing authoritarian regimes and liberal values. In response, Russia promotes the anti-liberal sentiments, including racism, antisemitism, homophobia, and misogyny. Russia has sought to promote the idea that the American democratic state is failing.

=== Russia, China and Pro Palestinian protests ===
&quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported in 2024 that China and Russia were promoting Pro Palestinian influencers in order to manipulate British public opinion in favour of Russian and Chinese interests. NBC reported that Russia was using different tools to cause division within the US, by delegitimizing US police operations against Pro Palestinian protests and by pivoting public conversation from the Russian invasion in Ukraine to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Russian media activity increased by 400% in the weeks after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel.

=== United States COVID-19 disinformation campaign ===
According to a report by Reuters, the United States ran a propaganda campaign to spread disinformation about the Sinovac Chinese COVID-19 vaccine, including using fake social media accounts to spread the disinformation that the Sinovac vaccine contained pork-derived ingredients and was therefore &quot;haram&quot; under Islamic law. The campaign was described as &quot;payback&quot; for COVID-19 disinformation by China directed against the U.S. The campaign primarily targeted people in the Philippines and used a social media hashtag for &quot;China is the virus&quot; in Tagalog. The campaign ran from 2020 to mid-2021. The primary contractor for the U.S. military on the project was General Dynamics IT, which received $493 million for its role.

==Legal and ethical concerns==

While information warfare has yielded many advances in the types of attack that a government can make, it has also raised concerns about the moral and legal ambiguities surrounding this particularly new form of war. Traditionally, wars have been analyzed by moral scholars according to just war theory. However, with Information Warfare, Just War Theory fails because the theory is based on the traditional conception of war. Information Warfare has three main issues surrounding it compared to traditional warfare:

#The risk for the party or nation initiating the cyberattack is substantially lower than the risk for a party or nation initiating a traditional attack. This makes it easier for governments, as well as potential terrorist or criminal organizations, to make these attacks more frequently than they could with traditional war.
#Information communication technologies (ICT) are so immersed in the modern world that a very wide range of technologies are at risk of a cyberattack. Specifically, civilian technologies can be targeted for cyberattacks and attacks can even potentially be launched through civilian computers or websites. As such, it is harder to enforce control of civilian infrastructures than a physical space. Attempting to do so would also raise many ethical concerns about the right to privacy, making defending against such attacks even tougher.
#The mass-integration of ICT into our system of war makes it much harder to assess accountability for situations that may arise when using robotic and/or cyber attacks. For robotic weapons and automated systems, it&#x27;s becoming increasingly hard to determine who is responsible for any particular event that happens. This issue is exacerbated in the case of cyberattacks, as sometimes it is virtually impossible to trace who initiated the attack in the first place.

Recently, legal concerns have arisen centered on these issues, specifically the issue of the right to privacy in the United States of America. Lt. General Keith B. Alexander, who served as the head of Cyber Command under President Barack Obama, noted that there was a &quot;mismatch between our technical capabilities to conduct operations and the governing laws and policies&quot; when writing to the Senate Armed Services Committee. A key point of concern was the targeting of civilian institutions for cyberattacks, to which the general promised to try to maintain a mindset similar to that of traditional war, in which they will seek to limit the impact on civilians.

<text>Mammon (Aramaic: מָמוֹנָא, māmōnā) in the New Testament is commonly thought to mean money, material wealth, or any entity that promises wealth, and is associated with the greedy pursuit of gain. The Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke both quote Jesus using the word in a phrase often rendered in English as &quot;You cannot serve both God and mammon.&quot;

In the Middle Ages, it was often personified and sometimes included in the seven princes of Hell.
&quot;Mammon&quot; in Hebrew (ממון) means &#x27;money&#x27;. The word was adopted to modern Hebrew to mean wealth.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Mammon&quot; comes into English from post-classical Latin &quot;mammona&quot; &#x27;wealth&#x27;, used most importantly in the Vulgate Bible (along with Tertullian&#x27;s &quot;mammonas&quot; and pseudo-Jerome&#x27;s &quot;mammon&quot;). This was in turn borrowed from Hellenistic Greek μαμωνᾶς, which appears in the New Testament, borrowed from Aramaic מָמוֹנָא &quot;māmōnā&quot;, an emphatic form of the word &quot;māmōn&quot; &#x27;wealth, profit&#x27;, perhaps specifically from the Syriac dialect. The spelling μαμμωνᾷ refers to &quot;a Syrian deity, god of riches; Hence riches, wealth&quot;; μαμωνᾶς is transliterated from Aramaic [ממון] and also means &quot;wealth&quot;. However, it is not clear what the earlier history of the Aramaic form was. The word may have been present throughout the Canaanite languages: the word is unknown in Old Testament Hebrew, but has been found in the Qumran documents; post-biblical Hebrew attests to &quot;māmōn&quot;; and, according to Augustine of Hippo, Punic included the word &quot;mammon&quot; &#x27;profit&#x27;. It has been suggested that the Aramaic word &quot;māmōn&quot; was a loanword from Mishnaic Hebrew ממון (mamôn) meaning money, wealth, or possessions; although it may also have meant &quot;that in which one trusts&quot;.

According to the Textus Receptus of the New Testament, the Greek word translated &quot;Mammon&quot; is spelt in the dative case as [οὐ δύνασθε θεῷ δουλεύειν καὶ] μαμμωνᾷ in the Sermon on the Mount at Matthew 6:24, while in the Parable of the Unjust Steward at Luke 16, it appears respectively as [ἐκ τοῦ] μαμωνᾶ (genitive case) in verse 9, [ἐν τῷ ἀδίκῳ] μαμωνᾷ (dative case) in verse 11, and [οὐ δύνασθε θεῷ δουλεύειν καὶ] μαμωνᾷ (dative case) in verse 13. The 28th edition of the popular Critical Text of the New Testament has the same readings as the TR, except in Matthew: μαμωνᾷ. The LSJ has a listing for only [nominative:] μαμωνᾶς, [genitive ending:] ᾶ, with entry &quot;wealth. Ev.Luc 16.9, al. (Aramaic word),&quot; without any entry for the -μμ- form. The Authorised Version uses &quot;Mammon&quot; for both Greek spellings; John Wycliffe uses &quot;richessis&quot;.

The Revised Standard Version of the Bible says it is &quot;a Semitic word for money or riches&quot;. The International Children&#x27;s Bible (ICB) uses the wording &quot;You cannot serve God and money at the same time&quot;.

Christians began to use &quot;mammon&quot; as a term that was used to describe gluttony, excessive materialism, greed, and unjust worldly gain.


Early mentions of Mammon allude to the Gospels, e.g., &quot;Didascalia&quot;, &quot;&quot;De solo Mammona cogitant, quorum Deus est sacculus&quot; (lit. &quot;They think only of Mammon, whose God is the purse&quot;); and Saint Augustine, &quot;Lucrum Punice Mammon dicitur&quot; (lit. &quot;Riches is called Mammon by the Phoenicians&quot;&quot; (Sermon on the Mount, ii).

== Personifications ==
Gregory of Nyssa also asserted that Mammon was another name for Beelzebub.

In the 4th century Cyprian and Jerome relate Mammon to greed and greed as an evil master that enslaves, and John Chrysostom even personifies Mammon as greed.

During the Middle Ages, Mammon was commonly personified as the demon of wealth and greed. Thus Peter Lombard (II, dist. 6) says, &quot;Riches are called by the name of a devil, namely Mammon, for Mammon is the name of a devil, by which name riches are called according to the Syrian tongue.&quot; Piers Plowman also regards Mammon as a deity. Nicholas de Lyra, commenting on the passage in Luke, says: &quot;Mammon est nomen daemonis&quot; (Mammon is the name of a demon).

Albert Barnes in his &quot;Notes on the New Testament&quot; states that Mammon was a Syriac word for an idol worshipped as the god of riches, similar to Plutus among the Greeks, but he cited no authority for the statement.

No trace, however, of any Syriac god of such a name exists, and the common literary identification of the name with a god of covetousness or avarice likely stems from Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, where Mammon oversees a cave of worldly wealth. Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; describes a fallen angel who values earthly treasure over all other things. Later occultist writings such as Jacques Collin de Plancy&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire Infernal&quot; describe Mammon as Hell&#x27;s ambassador to England. For Thomas Carlyle in &quot;Past and Present&quot; (1843), the &quot;Gospel of Mammonism&quot; became simply a metaphoric personification for the materialist spirit of the 19th century.

Mammon is somewhat similar to the Greek god Plutus, and the Roman Dis Pater, in his description, and it is likely that he was at some point based on them; especially since Plutus appears in &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; as a wolf-like demon of wealth, wolves having been associated with greed in the Middle Ages. Thomas Aquinas metaphorically described the sin of Avarice as &quot;Mammon being carried up from Hell by a wolf, coming to inflame the human heart with Greed&quot;.

Under the influence of the Social Gospel movement, American populists, progressives and &quot;muck-rakers&quot; during the generation of 1880–1925 used &quot;Mammon&quot; with specific reference to the consolidated wealth and power of the banking and corporate institutions headquartered on Wall Street and their predatory activities nationwide.

==In various countries==
* &quot;Mamona&quot; (sometimes &quot;Mamuna&quot;) is a synonym for mammon among Slavs. In the 21st century, the word &quot;mamona&quot; is used figuratively and derogatorily in Polish as a synonym of money. In Slovak the word &quot;mamonár&quot; is sometimes used to refer to a greedy person.
* The word &quot;mammona&quot; is quite often used in the Finnish and Estonian languages as a synonym of material wealth.
* In German, the word &quot;Mammon&quot; is a colloquial and contemptuous term for &quot;money&quot;. Usually as a phrase in combination with the adjective &quot;schnöde&quot; (&quot;der schnöde Mammon&quot; = the contemptible mammon).

==In literature==
The 1409 Lollard manuscript titled &quot;Lanterne of Light&quot; associated Mammon with the deadly sin of greed.

In &quot;Past and Present&quot; (1843), Thomas Carlyle describes Victorian England&#x27;s worship of money as the &quot;Gospel of Mammonism&quot;.

== In popular culture ==

Numerous characters and demons are named Mammon in books, film, television, and games.

<doc id="144592" wikidata="Q201821" url="?curid=144592" title="Finnair">
<text>Finnair Plc (, ) is the flag carrier and largest full-service legacy airline of Finland, with headquarters in Vantaa on the grounds of Helsinki Airport, its hub. Finnair and its subsidiaries dominate both domestic and international air travel in Finland. Its major shareholder is the government of Finland, which owns 55.9% of its shares. Finnair is a member of the Oneworld airline alliance.

Founded in 1923, Finnair is the fifth oldest airline in continuous operation and is consistently listed as one of the safest in the world. The company&#x27;s slogans are &quot;Designed for you&quot; and &quot;The Nordic Way.&quot;

== History ==
=== Founding ===
In 1923, consul Bruno Lucander founded Finnair as Aero O/Y (&quot;Aero Ltd&quot;). The company code, &quot;AY&quot;, stands for Aero Osake-yhtiö (&quot;yhtiö&quot; means &quot;company&quot; in Finnish). Lucander had previously run the Finnish operations of the Estonian airline Aeronaut. In mid 1923, he concluded an agreement with Junkers Flugzeugwerke AG to provide aircraft and technical support in exchange for a 50% ownership in the new airline. The charter establishing the company was signed in Helsinki on 12 September 1923, and the company was entered into the trade register on 11 December 1923. The first flight was on 20 March 1924, from Helsinki to Tallinn, Estonia, on a Junkers F.13 aircraft equipped with floats. The seaplane service ended in 1936 following the construction of the first aerodromes in Finland.

=== World War II ===
Air raids on Helsinki and other Finnish cities made World War II a difficult period for the airline. Half of the fleet was requisitioned by the Finnish Air Force and it was estimated that, during the Winter War in 1939 and 1940, half of the airline&#x27;s passengers from other Finnish cities were children being evacuated to Sweden.

=== Immediate postwar period ===
The Finnish government wanted longer routes, so it acquired a majority stake in the company in 1946 and re-established services to Europe in November 1947, initially using the Douglas DC-3. In 1953, the airline began branding itself as Finnair. The Convair 440 twin-engined pressurised airliner was acquired from January 1953, and these faster aircraft were operated on the company&#x27;s longer routes as far as London.

=== Jet Age (1960s and 1970s) ===
In 1961, Finnair joined the jet age by adding Rolls-Royce Avon-engined Caravelles to its fleet. These were later exchanged with the manufacturer for Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-engined Super Caravelles. In 1962, Finnair acquired a 27% controlling interest in a private Finnish airline, Kar-Air. Finnair Oy became the company&#x27;s official name on 25 June 1968. In 1969, it took possession of its first U.S. made jet, a Douglas DC-8. The first transatlantic service to New York was inaugurated on 15 May 1969. In the 1960s, Finnair&#x27;s head office was in Helsinki.

Finnair received its first wide-body aircraft in 1975, two DC-10-30 planes. The first of these arrived on 4 February 1975 and entered service on 14 February 1975, flying between Helsinki and New York, later between Helsinki and Las Palmas.

Finnair created Finnaviation was established in 1979. It was formed from the reorganization of Wihuri OY Finnwings (which had started services in 1950 as Lentohuolto OY) and its merging with Nordair OY. Scheduled domestic services began in October 1979. In the early 1980s, Finnair held a 60% shareholding. Finnaviation was eventually completely merged into Finnair.

=== Expansion (1980s) ===
In 1981, Finnair opened routes to Seattle and Los Angeles. Finnair became the first operator to fly non-stop from Western Europe to Japan, operating Helsinki–Tokyo flights with a modified McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30ER in April 1983. Until then, flights had to go via Moscow (Aeroflot, SAS, BA) or Anchorage (most carriers) due to Soviet airspace restrictions, but Finnair circumvented these by flying directly north from Helsinki, over the North Pole and back south through the Bering Strait, avoiding Soviet airspace. However, Finnair did not have to make a roundabout because of the Soviet regulation on this route, but the Japanese authorities demanded it (as JAL requested strongly). The aircraft was fitted with extra fuel tanks, taking 13 hours for the trip. The routes through Soviet airspace and with a stopover in Moscow also took 13 hours, but flights with a stopover in Anchorage took up to 16 hours, giving Finnair a competitive edge. In the spring of 1986, Soviet regulators finally cleared the way for Air France and Japan Airlines to fly nonstop Paris-Tokyo services over Soviet airspace, putting Finnair at a disadvantage.

Finnair launched a Helsinki-Beijing route in 1988, making Finnair the first Western European carrier to fly non-stop between Europe and China. In 1989, Finnair became the launch customer for the McDonnell Douglas MD-11, the first of which was delivered on 7 December 1990. The first revenue service with the MD-11 took place on 20 December 1990, with OH-LGA operating a flight from Helsinki to Tenerife in the Canary Islands.

=== Subsidiary airlines (1990s–2000s) ===

In 1997, the subsidiaries Kar-Air and Finnaviation became wholly owned by Finnair and were integrated into the mainline operations. On 25 September 1997, the company&#x27;s official name was changed to Finnair Oyj.

In 1999, Finnair joined the Oneworld airline alliance. In 2001, Finnair reused the name &quot;Aero&quot; when establishing Aero Airlines, a subsidiary airline based in Tallinn, Estonia.

In 2003, Finnair acquired ownership of the Swedish low-cost airline, FlyNordic, which operated mainly within Scandinavia. In 2007, Finnair sold all its shares in FlyNordic to Norwegian Air Shuttle. As part of the transaction, Finnair acquired 4.8% of the latter company, becoming its third largest shareholder. Finnair later sold their shares in 2013.

On 8 March 2007, Finnair became the first airline to order the Airbus A350 XWB aircraft, placing an order for 11 Airbus A350 XWB (plus 8 options), with delivery started in 2015.

=== Labour disputes and restructuring (2006–present) ===
Finnair has suffered from many labour disputes in this period, resulting from cost-cutting measures prompted by competition from budget airlines.

On 1 December 2011, Finnair transferred its baggage and apron services to Swissport International as per a five-year agreement signed on 7 November 2011.

As of 2022, it transported about 2.9 million passengers, a substantial decrease from 2019 as COVID-19 pandemic shut down airports and airlines due to travel restrictions. At the end of 2022, the airline employed 5,325 people on average. From 2022 onwards, the Russian airspace closure resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine has forced Finnair to suspend some services to Asia.

In March 2023, Finnair announced it would terminate domestic flights from both Tampere and Turku to Helsinki in favor of coach service due to low demand and the short distance.

Two subsidiary companies, Finnair Cargo Oy and Finnair Cargo Terminal Operations Oy, form Finnair&#x27;s cargo business. The offices of both companies are at Helsinki Airport. Finnair Cargo uses Finnair&#x27;s fleet on its cargo operations.

Finnair Cargo has three hubs:
* Helsinki Airport: Helsinki Airport is the main hub of Finnair Cargo. There is a new freight terminal at the airport, opened in the first half of 2017.
* Brussels Airport: Finnair Cargo has used Brussels Airport as a secondary hub for freight operations. Now the cargo airline operates its flights from BRU in co-operation with DHL Aviation (EAT Leipzig).
* London Heathrow Airport: Heathrow Airport is the most recent hub addition to Finnair Cargo&#x27;s route network. In cooperation with IAG Cargo, Finnair operates to LHR daily with Airbus A350 to carry extra freight.

====Nordic Regional Airlines====
Nordic Regional Airlines (Norra) is 40% owned by Finnair. The airline uses a fleet of ATR 72-500 aircraft, leased from Finnair, and Embraer 190 aircraft, both painted in Finnair livery. The airline began operations on 20 October 2011 as a joint venture between Flybe and Finnair. The airline has operated under Finnair&#x27;s flight code since 1 May 2015.

=== Head office ===
Finnair&#x27;s head office, known as the House of Travel and Transportation (or &quot;HOTT&quot;), is located on the grounds of Helsinki Airport approximately 1 km south of the passenger terminal. The office opened in 2013, replacing the previous head office which stood on an adjacent lot. The mixed-use building has a total floor area of across seven floors, including of office space.

The previous airport head office had been in use since 1994, then replacing an office located in central Helsinki. The last Helsinki head office, designed by architect , opened in 1972. Finnair fully vacated the building in 2013, and in 2016, it was converted into rental storage units.

===Corporate design===
====Livery====
The company revealed a new livery in December 2010. Major changes include a restyled and larger lettering on the aircraft body, repainting of the engines in white, and a reversal of the color scheme for the tail fin favoring a white background with a blue stylized logo. The outline of the globe was also removed from the tail fin.

====Flight attendant uniforms====
The current uniform was designed by Ritva-Liisa Pohjalainen and launched in December 2011. Finnair has codes to indicate the rank of crew members: one stripe in the sleeve (or epaulettes in the case of male crew wearing vests) for normal Cabin Crew, two stripes for Senior Cabin Crew (only for outsourced Spanish crew) acting as a Purser, and three stripes for a Purser/Chief Purser. Additionally, some female Pursers have a white vertical stripe on their dresses or blouses indicating their years of service. Finnair requires its cabin crew to wear gloves during take-off and landing for safety reasons. Finnair&#x27;s previous cabin crew uniform was named the fifth most stylish uniform by the French magazine &quot;Bon Voyage&quot;.

=== Partnerships ===
Finnair has several partnerships with following companies and airlines including Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, British Airways, Deutsche Bahn (DB), Chinese JD.com, Japan Airlines and Marimekko.

== Destinations ==

Finnair flies from its Helsinki hub to over 80 destinations in over 35 countries in Asia including India , Europe and North America. Finnair also serves six destinations in the United States. Previously the airline has served Africa and South America, including countries such as Egypt, Colombia and Brazil, but primarily on a leisure basis. Finnair has over 10 domestic destinations. Domestic flights are operated in co-operation with the airline&#x27;s subsidiary Nordic Regional Airlines. 

In 2021, Finnair opened five routes from Stockholm–Arlanda to Bangkok–Suvarnabhumi and Phuket in Thailand, as well as New York–JFK, Miami and Los Angeles in the United States. Those routes have been discontinued.

On 28 February 2022, Russia closed its airspace as a countermeasure to EU airspace closure. This meant many changes to Finnair&#x27;s Asian services, as most of Finnair&#x27;s flights between Europe and Asia had used the shortest, fastest, and most environmentally sound route over Russia. In response, on 9 March 2022, flight AY073 departed from Helsinki to Tokyo Narita via the North Pole. Back in 1983, Finnair was the first airline to fly non-stop from Europe to Japan by flying over the North Pole – so operating in the polar region is not new to Finnair.

Finnair announced a new route to Dallas/Fort Worth in 2022. Finnair also reintroduced flights to Seattle/Tacoma in 2022.

=== Aircraft types ===

==== Narrow-body aircraft ====

Finnair received its first narrow-body aircraft manufactured by Airbus, the Airbus A321, on 28 January 1999. Now, the airline operates a fleet of up to 15 A321s. The first Airbus A319 aircraft was delivered to Finnair on 20 September 1999. Since then, Finnair has received 11 A319s, but three of them are now retired. Finnair utilizes Airbus A319, A320, and A321 aircraft on domestic and European flights. The Airbus A321-231 aircraft, which are equipped with Sharklets, are also used on some thinner long-haul flights such as to Dubai. ATR 72-500 and Embraer 190 are operated by Nordic Regional Airlines and are also used on domestic and European flights.

==== Airbus A330 ====

Finnair received its first batch of Airbus A330-300s on 27 March 2009. Now the airline has eight of them in its fleet. As of July 2023, the airline utilizes the A330 on intercontinental flights from Helsinki to Delhi, Mumbai, New York, Chicago, Seattle and Doha. The A330s are powered by General Electric CF6-80E1 engines. The aircraft are also being used on European services to Brussels and Amsterdam.

==== Airbus A350 ====
On 8 March 2007, Finnair firmed up its orders for 11 Airbus A350 aircraft with 8 options. On 3 December 2014, it was announced that Finnair had firmed up the contract for eight additional Airbus A350 aircraft deliveries starting in 2018. On 13 August 2014, Finnair announced plans to initially deploy its A350 aircraft on services to Bangkok, Beijing and Shanghai from 2015, with A350 services to Hong Kong and Singapore to be added in 2016. As of April 2019, Finnair operates the Airbus A350 to Bangkok, Beijing, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Ho Chi Minh City, Krabi, Los Angeles, Nagoya, Osaka, Phuket, Puerto Vallarta, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo. Finnair also operated A350 aircraft on several flights to New York in January 2016 and became the first European airline to operate the A350 to the United States. Finnair sometimes uses the A350 on the morning AY1331 flight from Helsinki to London–Heathrow to carry extra freight as well. Also, AY121/122 operating to New Delhi is also being served by the A350 as of 1 Nov 2022. As of autumn 2024, Finnair began operating the A350 daily to Gran Canaria as AY1721. Seldomly, it also operates to Amsterdam, Munich and Brussels.

Finnair took delivery of its first A350 aircraft on 7 October 2015, becoming the third airline to operate the aircraft after Qatar Airways and Vietnam Airlines. According to the current delivery schedule, it will receive two A350 aircraft per year in 2019, 2020, and 2021, and one in 2022. Altogether, Finnair had 19 A350 aircraft in 2022.

===Fleet development===
====Upcoming narrow-body fleet renewal====
Due to an aging narrow-body fleet, Finnair plans to retire the Airbus A320 family and replace them with new generation aircraft. The airline estimates to invest up to €4 billion in fleet renewal between 2020 and 2025. Revealed at its Capital Markets Day on November 12, 2019, Finnair plans to grow the size of its fleet from the current 83 (as of November 2019) to approximately 100 by 2025, of which 70% is planned to be narrow-body aircraft and 30% wide-body aircraft. One-third of the total investment sum would be used for growth, while two-thirds would be to replace the current fleet. According to Bloomberg, Finnair will replace the old aircraft with either Airbus A320neo family or Boeing 737 MAX new generation aircraft. The carrier has also revealed that it is looking for suitable narrow-body aircraft for long-haul use.

On 18 December 2015, Finnair decided to improve the space efficiency of its current Airbus narrow-body fleet due to a growing need for feeder traffic capacity. The value of the investment is approximately EUR 40 million, and it includes 22 narrow-body Airbus aircraft in Finnair&#x27;s fleet. The cabin layout change excludes five A321 aircraft, which are already configured according to the plan, having 209 seats. The cabin reconfiguration was estimated to take two weeks per aircraft during 2017. The reconfiguration adds 6 to 13 seats depending on the aircraft type, increasing the passenger capacity of Finnair&#x27;s Airbus narrow-body fleet as measured by available seat kilometers by close to 4 percent. Finnair also planned to increase its narrow-body fleet. As a first step, Finnair leased eight Airbus A321 narrow-body aircraft from BOC Aviation.

Finnair has occasionally suffered from aircraft shortages and therefore has resorted to leased and wet-leased aircraft. For instance, in March 2016, Finnair announced it would lease two Airbus A321 aircraft from Air Berlin for Finnair&#x27;s European operations. These two aircraft were delivered in late April 2016 to Finnair. The airline used these A321s on flights from Helsinki to Amsterdam, Berlin, Copenhagen, Dubrovnik, Düsseldorf, Ljubljana, Paris, Split, Vienna, and Zürich. On 15 December 2016, Finnair announced it would lease two Airbus A321s from CDB Aviation Lease Finance. The first aircraft was scheduled for delivery to Finnair for the 2017-2018 winter season and the second for the 2018 summer season. Seven of the ordered aircraft were delivered in 2017.

The Finnair-branded short-haul network also includes 24 regional aircraft operated by Nordic Regional Airlines (12 ATR 72 and 12 E-190).

====Recent wide-body fleet renewal====
Finnair announced the order for 11 Airbus A350 XWB aircraft and 8 options on 8 March 2007. Finnair planned to retire older Airbus A340 aircraft by the end of 2017 and replace them with brand new A350 aircraft. As of 1 February 2017, all Airbus A340 aircraft are withdrawn from the fleet. The very last A340 (OH-LQE) operated its last flight from Tokyo to Helsinki on 1 February 2017. Finnair firmed up orders for eight additional A350 aircraft on 3 December 2014. The first A350 was delivered to Finnair in October 2015, and the airline became the first European operator of the Airbus A350.

As of November 2019, Finnair had 14 A350-900s, with a further 5 to be delivered between 2020 and 2022. The Finnish flag carrier also has considered switching some of the orders for the Airbus A350-900 to the Airbus A350-1000 aircraft but decided to keep the orders for only the A350-900. At the beginning of 2017, Finnair revealed plans to add more seats to some of the Airbus A350 aircraft in order to increase capacity by up to 13%. The new seat configuration has 32 seats in Business Class, 42 seats in Economy Comfort Class, and 262 in Economy Class, a total of 336 seats. This second seat configuration was initially planned to be used on routes with less business class demand such as Bangkok, Beijing, and Seoul, as well as on routes to leisure destinations but they have also been utilized on other busy routes such as Shanghai, Osaka, and Tokyo.

Finnair has modified its previous fleet plan to retire two of Airbus A330 aircraft, which was established in 2014. The 2016 fleet plan now involves keeping its A330 fleet as its A350s are delivered, rather than withdrawing two of them in 2017, and shall retire those aircraft sometime in the 2020s at the earliest. The airline&#x27;s plan to retire two A330s was not the only change that was planned. Under the previous plan, the long-haul fleet was to grow by one per year, from 15 in 2015 to 20 in 2020. Under the 2016 plan, it was planned to grow to 22 in 2020, and to 26 in 2023. However, should market conditions be weaker than expected, Finnair has the flexibility to return the wide-body fleet to a total of 15 aircraft in 2019 and to maintain it at this level through to 2023. Some of the new A350 aircraft will increase the number of aircraft operated by Finnair.

===Special liveries===
Finnair&#x27;s current special liveries are Marimekko &quot;Kivet&quot;, Marimekko 50th anniversary &quot;Unikko&quot;, Oneworld liveries, and the Christmas special &quot;Reindeer&quot; liveries. Past Finnair special liveries include &quot;Marimekko Unikko&quot;, &quot;Moomins&quot;, &quot;Santa Claus&quot;, 1950s retro livery and &quot;Angry Birds&quot;.

===Cabins===
====Business class====
Business class is offered on the entire Airbus fleet. On long-haul aircraft, the seats are equipped with personal in-flight entertainment. Zodiac Cirrus III seats are fitted in business class on all wide-body aircraft. Each seat has direct aisle access and reclines to a 78-inch full flat bed. In February 2022, Finnair unveiled new long-haul business class seats, alongside the debut of a premium economy cabin. The seats are based on the Collins Aerospace&#x27;s Aerospace AirLounge. The seats are enclosed in a shell with no recline capabilities. According to the airline, this allows passengers to choose a wide variety of sitting and sleeping positions.

====Premium Economy class====
Premium economy, Finnair&#x27;s newest class of service, was introduced in February 2022. It is currently rolled out on the Airbus A330s and A350s. The seats are based on the Vector Premium by HAECO.

===In-flight magazine===
Finnair&#x27;s English-language in-flight magazine, &quot;Blue Wings&quot;, was published 10 times a year. The first edition of &quot;Blue Wings&quot; magazine was published in 1980. It was discontinued in 2020 and is now available online in Finnish and English. Domestic and international newspapers are available online on Finnair Nordic Sky portal during flights. As of 2023, &quot;Blue Wings&quot; has been reintroduced in physical form for Finnair&#x27;s centenary year and the years to come.

== Environmental efforts ==
In December 2018, Finnair flights out of SFO began being supplied with sustainable aviation fuel as part of a project involving SFO, Shell, and SkyNRG.

== Incidents and accidents ==

*On 16 November 1927, a Junkers F.13 disappeared en route from Tallinn to Helsinki. The pilot and his two passengers were never found.
*On 10 November 1937, a Junkers Ju 52 en route from Turku to Stockholm suffered the detachment of the nose-engine whilst over the sea. The pilots managed to successfully land the aircraft with no fatalities. A broken propeller blade resulted in a severe imbalance that tore the engine off.
*On 14 June 1940, a Ju 52 aircraft named Kaleva operating as Flight 1631 was shot down by the Soviet Air Force over the Gulf of Finland, apparently as a prelude to the Occupation of Estonia. All nine people on board died.
*On 7 June 1941, a Ju 52 aircraft equipped with floats was forced to make an emergency landing after losing power on all three engines due to fuel impurity. Although the aircraft was recovered and returned to service, the two occupants of the aircraft drowned while attempting to swim to safety.
*On 31 October 1945, a Ju 52 suffered a CFIT on approach to Hyvinkää. Radio signals were distorted by high-tension wires and the pilots let the plane descend too low. All 14 people on board survived, but the aircraft was written off.
*On 3 January 1961, Flight 311 from Kronoby to Vaasa flown by a Douglas DC-3 stalled on final approach and crashed, killing all 25 people on board. The two pilots were both intoxicated by alcohol and sleep deprived. This remains Finland&#x27;s worst aviation accident.
*On 8 November 1963, Flight 217 from Helsinki to Mariehamn via Turku flown by a DC-3 crashed into terrain on final approach to Mariehamn. The sole flight attendant and two passengers were the only survivors of the crash. The cause was believed to have been poor visibility and a malfunctioning altimeter that tricked the pilots into believing they were higher than they really were. 20 passengers and two crew were killed. To date, this is Finnair&#x27;s last fatal accident.
*On 30 September 1978, Flight 405 from Oulu to Helsinki flown by Sud Aviation Caravelle was hijacked by Aarno Lamminparras armed with a pistol (Finland did not perform security checks on domestic flights), who held the 48 other passengers and crew hostage. The plane continued to Helsinki, where 34 of the 44 passengers were released before returning to Oulu where the hijacker received a large ransom from Finnair. The plane then returned to Helsinki for another ransom from a Finnish newspaper before flying to Amsterdam and then back to Helsinki before returning to Oulu. The hijacker released the last hostages and departed the plane before being arrested on October 1 at his home.
*On 23 December 1987, Flight 915 from Tokyo to Helsinki was allegedly shot at by a missile whilst over Svalbard. The missile allegedly exploded in the air before striking the DC-10. The events were not revealed until 2014.

<doc id="144596" wikidata="Q321032" url="?curid=144596" title="Council of Florence">
<text>The Council of Florence is the seventeenth ecumenical council recognized by the Catholic Church, held between 1431 and 1449. It was convened in territories under the Holy Roman Empire. Italy became a venue of a Catholic ecumenical council after a gap of about 2 centuries (the last ecumenical council to be held in Italy was the 4th Council of the Lateran in Rome&#x27;s Lateran Palace). It was convoked in Basel as the Council of Basel by Pope Martin V shortly before his death in February 1431 and took place in the context of the Hussite Wars in Bohemia and the rise of the Ottoman Empire. At stake was the greater conflict between the conciliar movement and the principle of papal supremacy.

The Council entered a second phase after Emperor Sigismund&#x27;s death in 1437. Pope Eugene IV translated the Council to Ferrara on 8 January 1438, where it became the Council of Ferrara and succeeded in drawing some of the Byzantine ambassadors who were in attendance at Basel to Italy. Some Council members rejected the papal decree and remained at Basel: this rump Council suspended Eugene, declared him a heretic, and then in November 1439 elected an antipope, Felix V.

After becoming the Council of Florence (having moved to avoid the plague in Ferrara), the Council concluded in 1445 after negotiating union with the Eastern Orthodox Church. This bridging of the Great Schism proved fleeting, but was a political coup for the papacy. In 1447, Sigismund&#x27;s successor Frederick III commanded the city of Basel to expel the Council of Basel; the rump Council reconvened in Lausanne before dissolving itself in 1449.

==Background==
The initial location in the Prince-Bishopric of Basel reflected the desire among parties seeking reform to meet outside territories directly controlled by the Pope, the Emperor or the kings of Aragon and France, whose influences the council hoped to avoid. Ambrogio Traversari attended the Council of Basel as legate of Pope Eugene IV.

Under pressure for ecclesiastical reform, Pope Martin V sanctioned a decree of the Council of Constance (9 October 1417) obliging the papacy to summon general councils periodically. At the expiration of the first term fixed by this decree, Pope Martin V complied by calling a council at Pavia. Due to an epidemic the location transferred almost at once to Siena (see Council of Siena) and disbanded, in circumstances still imperfectly known, just as it had begun to discuss the subject of reform (1424). The next council fell due at the expiration of seven years in 1431; Martin V duly convoked it for this date to the town of Basel and selected to preside over it the cardinal Julian Cesarini, a well-respected prelate. Martin himself, however, died before the opening of the synod.

==Council of Basel==
The Council was seated on 14 December 1431, at a period when the conciliar movement was strong and the authority of the papacy weak. The Council at Basel opened with only a few bishops and abbots attending, but it grew rapidly and to make its numbers greater gave the lower orders a majority over the bishops. It adopted an anti-papal attitude, proclaimed the superiority of the Council over the Pope, and prescribed an oath to be taken by each new Pope. On 18 December Martin&#x27;s successor, Pope Eugene IV, tried to dissolve it and open a new council on Italian soil at Bologna, but he was overruled.

The council was held in the Cathedral of Basel, where benches were placed for the 400 and more members, and general congregations were held either in the cathedral or in its chapter house. The clerks of ceremonies were Enea Silvio Piccolomini and Michel Brunout.

Sigismund, King of Hungary and titular King of Bohemia, had been defeated at the Battle of Domažlice in the fifth crusade against the Hussites in August 1431. Under his sponsorship, the Council negotiated a peace with the Calixtine faction of the Hussites in January 1433. Pope Eugene acknowledged the council in May and crowned Sigismund Holy Roman Emperor on 31 May 1433. The divided Hussites were defeated in May 1434. In June 1434, the pope had to flee a revolt in Rome and began a ten-year exile in Florence.

==Replacement by the Council of Florence==
In 1438, Pope Eugene convened a new council at Ferrara, which however was transferred to Florence in 1439 because of the danger of plague at Ferrara and because Florence had agreed, against future payment, to finance the Council.

==Rump Council of Basel==
Most of the original Council moved from Basel to Ferrara in 1438. Some remained at Basel, still claiming to be the Council. They elected Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy, as Pope Felix V. He is considered an antipope, and was the only claimant to the papal throne who ever took the Basel oath. Driven out of Basel in 1448, they moved to Lausanne. In 1449, Felix V resigned and the rump Council formally closed.

==Meeting in Florence==
The Council had meanwhile successfully negotiated reunification with several Eastern Churches, reaching agreements on such matters as the Western insertion of the phrase &quot;Filioque&quot; to the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed, the definition and number of the sacraments, and the doctrine of Purgatory. Another key issue was papal primacy, which involved the universal and supreme jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome over the whole Church, including the national Churches of the East (Serbian, Byzantine, Moldo-Wallachian, Bulgarian, Russian, Georgian, Armenian etc.), and nonreligious matters such as the promise of military assistance against the Ottoman Empire.

On 6 July 1439 the union was proclaimed (in both Latin and Greek) in the document &quot;Laetentur Caeli&quot; (&quot;Let the Heavens Rejoice&quot;) which was signed by Pope Eugene and by the Byzantine Emperor John VIII Palaiologos. All but one of the bishops were present. Some Greek bishops, perhaps feeling political pressure from the Byzantine Emperor, reluctantly accepted the decrees of the Council. Other Eastern bishops did so by sincere conviction, such as Isidore of Kiev, who subsequently suffered greatly for it. Only one Eastern Bishop refused to accept the union, Mark of Ephesus, who became the leader of opposition back in Byzantium; the Serbian patriarch did not even attend the council. The Russian Orthodox Church, upon learning of the union, angrily rejected it and ousted any prelate who was even remotely sympathetic to it, declaring itself autocephalous (i.e., autonomous), with subsequent Russian sources portraying the actions of Grand Prince Vasily II of Moscow as protecting the purity of the faith.

Despite the religious union, Western military assistance to Byzantium was ultimately insufficient, and the fall of Constantinople occurred in May 1453. The Council declared the Basel group heretics and excommunicated them, and affirmed the superiority of the Pope over the Councils in the bull &quot;Etsi non dubitemus&quot; of 20 April 1441.

The council also decided to terminate the dietary prohibition on Gentile converts to Christianity from consuming blood issued by the apostle James at the apostolic council of Jerusalem. This law although observed by the Eastern Orthodox Church, had been practically obsolete in the West since the Popes rejection of the Quinisext Council. 


==Composition==
The democratic character of the assembly at Basel was a result of both its composition and its organization. Doctors of theology, masters and representatives of chapters, monks and clerks of inferior orders constantly outnumbered the prelates in it, and the influence of the superior clergy had less weight because instead of being separated into &quot;nations&quot;, as at Constance, the fathers divided themselves according to their tastes or aptitudes into four large committees or &quot;deputations&quot; (&quot;deputationes&quot;). One was concerned with questions of faith (&quot;fidei&quot;), another with negotiations for peace (&quot;pacis&quot;), the third with reform (&quot;reformatorii&quot;), and the fourth with what they called &quot;common concerns&quot; (&quot;pro communibus&quot;). Every decision made by three &quot;deputations&quot; (the lower clergy formed the majority in each) received ratification for the sake of form in general congregation and, if necessary led to decrees promulgated in session. Papal critics thus termed the council &quot;an assembly of copyists&quot; or even &quot;a set of grooms and scullions&quot;. However, some prelates, although absent, were represented by their proxies.

Nicholas of Cusa was a member of the delegation sent to Constantinople with the pope&#x27;s approval to bring back the Byzantine emperor and his representatives to the Council of Florence of 1439. At the time of the council&#x27;s conclusion in 1439, Cusa was thirty-eight years old and thus, compared to the other clergy at the council, a fairly young man though one of the more accomplished in terms of the body of his complete works.

==Attempted dissolution==
From Italy, France and Germany, the fathers came late to Basel. Cesarini devoted all his energies to the war against the Hussites until the disaster of Taus forced him to evacuate Bohemia in haste. Pope Eugene IV, Martin V&#x27;s successor, lost hope that the council could be useful owing to the progress of heresy, the reported troubles in Germany, the war that had lately broken out between the dukes of Austria and Burgundy, and finally, the small number of fathers who had responded to the summons of Martin V. That opinion and his desire to preside over the council in person, induced him to recall the fathers from Germany, as his poor health made it difficult for him to go. He commanded the council to disperse, and appointed Bologna as their meeting place in eighteen months&#x27; time, with the intention of making the session of the council coincide with some conferences with representatives of the Orthodox Church of the Byzantine East, scheduled to be held there with a view to ecumenical union (18 December 1431).

That order led to an outcry among the fathers and incurred the deep disapproval of the legate Cesarini. They argued that the Hussites would think the Church afraid to face them and that the laity would accuse the clergy of shirking reform, both with disastrous effects. The pope explained his reasons and yielded certain points, but the fathers were intransigent. Considerable powers had been decreed to Church councils by the Council of Constance, which amid the troubles of the Western Schism had proclaimed the superiority, in certain cases, of the council over the pope, and the fathers at Basel insisted upon their right of remaining assembled. They held sessions, promulgated decrees, interfered in the government of the papal countship of Venaissin, treated with the Hussites, and, as representatives of the universal Church, presumed to impose laws upon the sovereign pontiff himself.

Eugene IV resolved to resist the Council&#x27;s claim of supremacy, but he did not dare openly to repudiate the conciliar doctrine considered by many to be the actual foundation of the authority of the popes before the schism. He soon realized the impossibility of treating the fathers of Basel as ordinary rebels, and tried a compromise; but as time went on, the fathers became more and more intractable, and between him and them gradually arose an impassable barrier.

Abandoned by a number of his cardinals, condemned by most of the powers, deprived of his dominions by &quot;condottieri&quot; who shamelessly invoked the authority of the council, the pope made concession after concession and ended on 15 December 1433 with a pitiable surrender of all the points at issue in a papal bull, the terms of which were dictated by the fathers of Basel, that is, by declaring his bull of dissolution null and void and recognising that the synod as legitimately assembled throughout. However, Eugene IV did not ratify all the decrees coming from Basel, nor make a definite submission to the supremacy of the council. He declined to express any forced pronouncement on this subject, and his enforced silence concealed the secret design of safeguarding the principle of sovereignty.
The fathers, filled with suspicion, would allow only the legates of the pope to preside over them on condition of their recognizing the superiority of the council. The legates submitted the humiliating formality but in their own names, it was asserted only after the fact, thus reserving the final judgment of the Holy See. Furthermore, the difficulties of all kinds against which Eugene had to contend, such as the insurrection at Rome, which forced him to escape by means of the Tiber, lying in the bottom of a boat, left him at first little chance of resisting the enterprises of the council.

==Issues of reform==
Emboldened by their success, the fathers approached the subject of reform, their principal object being to further curtail the power and resources of the papacy. They took decisions on the disciplinary measures that regulated the elections, on the celebration of divine service and on the periodical holding of diocesan synods and provincial councils, which were usual topics in Catholic councils. They also made decrees aimed at some of the assumed rights by which the popes had extended their power and improved their finances at the expense of the local churches. Thus the council abolished annates, greatly limited the abuse of &quot;reservation&quot; of the patronage of benefices by the Pope and completely abolished the right claimed by the pope of &quot;next presentation&quot; to benefices not yet vacant (known as &quot;gratiae expectativae&quot;). Other conciliar decrees severely limited the jurisdiction of the court of Rome and even made rules for the election of popes and the constitution of the Sacred College. The fathers continued to devote themselves to the subjugation of the Hussites, and they also intervened, in rivalry with the pope, in the negotiations between France and England, which led to the treaty of Arras, concluded by Charles VII of France with the duke of Burgundy. Also, circumcision was deemed to be a mortal sin. Finally, they investigated and judged numbers of private cases, lawsuits between prelates, members of religious orders and holders of benefices, thus themselves committing one of the serious abuses for which they had criticized the court of Rome.

==Papal primacy==
The Council clarified the Latin dogma of papal primacy:
==Eugene IV&#x27;s eastern strategy==

Eugene IV, however much he may have wished to keep on good terms with the fathers of Basel, found himself neither able nor willing to accept or observe all their decrees. The question of the union with the Byzantine church, especially, gave rise to a misunderstanding between them which soon led to a rupture. The Byzantine emperor John VIII Palaiologos, pressed hard by the Ottoman Turks, was keen to ally himself with the Catholics. He consented to come with the principal representatives of the Byzantine Church to some place in the West where the union could be concluded in the presence of the pope and of the Latin council. There arose a double negotiation between him and Eugene IV on the one hand and the fathers of Basel on the other. The council wished to fix the meeting-place at a place remote from the influence of the pope, and they persisted in suggesting Basel, Avignon or Savoy. On the other hand, the Byzantines wanted a coastal location in Italy for their ease of access by ship.

==Council transferred to Ferrara and attempted reunion with Eastern Orthodox Churches==

As a result of negotiations with the East, Emperor John VIII Palaiologos accepted Pope Eugene IV&#x27;s offer. By a bull dated 18 September 1437, Pope Eugene again pronounced the dissolution of the Council of Basel and summoned the fathers to Ferrara in the Po Valley.

The first public session at Ferrara began on 10 January 1438. Its first act declared the Council of Basel transferred to Ferrara and nullified all further proceedings at Basel. In the second public session (15 February 1438), Pope Eugene IV excommunicated all who continued to assemble at Basel.

In early April 1438, the Byzantine contingent, over 700 strong, arrived at Ferrara. On 9 April 1438, the first solemn session at Ferrara began, with the Eastern Roman Emperor, the Patriarch of Constantinople and representatives of the Patriarchal Sees of Antioch, Alexandria and Jerusalem in attendance and Pope Eugene IV presiding. The early sessions lasted until 17 July 1438 with each theological issue of the East–West Schism (1054) hotly debated, including the Processions of the Holy Spirit, the &quot;Filioque&quot; clause in the Nicene Creed, purgatory, and papal primacy. Resuming proceedings on 8 October 1438, the Council focused exclusively on the Filioque matter. Even as it became clear that the Byzantine Church would not consent to the Filioque clause, the Byzantine Emperor continued to press for a reconciliation.

Initially, the seating arrangements were meant to feature the pope in the middle with the Latins on one side and Greeks on the other, but the Greeks protested. It was decided to have the altar with the open Bible in the center of the one end of the chamber, and the two high ranking delegations facing each other on the sides of the altar, while the rest of the delegations were below further in chamber. The Byzantine Emperor&#x27;s throne was opposite that of the Holy Roman Emperor (who never attended), while the Patriarch of Constantinople faced opposite a cardinal, and the other high-ranking cardinals and bishops faced the Greek metropolitans. The throne of the pope was set slightly apart and higher.

==Council transferred to Florence and the near East–West union==
With finances running thin and on the pretext that the plague was spreading in the area, both the Latins and the Byzantines agreed to transfer the council to Florence. Continuing at Florence in January 1439, the Council made steady progress on a compromise formula, &quot;ex filio&quot;.

In the following months, agreement was reached on the Western doctrine of Purgatory and a return to the pre-schism prerogatives of the papacy. On 6 July 1439 an agreement (&quot;Laetentur Caeli&quot;) was signed by all the Eastern bishops but one, Mark of Ephesus, delegate for the Patriarch of Alexandria, who, contrary to the views of all others, held that Rome continued in both heresy and schism.

To complicate matters, Patriarch Joseph II of Constantinople had died the previous month. The Byzantine Patriarchs were unable to assert that ratification by the Eastern Church could be achieved without a clear agreement of the whole Church.

Upon their return, the Eastern bishops found their attempts toward agreement with the West broadly rejected by the monks, the populace, and by civil authorities (with the notable exception of the Emperors of the East who remained committed to union until the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Turkish Ottoman Empire two decades later). Facing the imminent threat, the Union was officially proclaimed by Isidore of Kiev in Hagia Sophia on 12 December 1452.

The Emperor, bishops, and people of Constantinople accepted this act as a temporary provision until the removal of the Ottoman threat. Yet, it was too late: on 29 May 1453 Constantinople fell. The union signed at Florence, down to the present, has not been implemented by the Orthodox Churches.

===Copts and Ethiopians===

The Council soon became even more international. The signature of this agreement for the union of the Latins and the Byzantines encouraged Pope Eugenius to announce the good news to the Coptic Christians, and invite them to send a delegation to Florence. He wrote a letter on 7 July 1439, and to deliver it, sent Alberto da Sarteano as an apostolic delegate. On 26 August 1441, Sarteano returned with four Ethiopians from Emperor Zara Yaqob and Copts. A contemporary observer described the Ethiopians saying &quot;They were black men and dry and very awkward in their bearing. At that time, Rome had delegates from a multitude of nations, from Armenia to Russia, Greece and various parts of north and east Africa.

==Deposition of Eugene IV and schism at Basel==
During this time the council of Basel, though nullified at Ferrara and abandoned by Cesarini and most of its members, persisted nonetheless, under the presidency of Cardinal Aleman. Affirming its ecumenical character on 24 January 1438, it suspended Eugene IV. The council went on (in spite of the intervention of most of the powers) to pronounce Eugene IV deposed (25 June 1439), giving rise to a new schism by electing (4 November 1439) duke Amadeus VIII of Savoy, as (anti)pope, who took the name of Felix V.

===Effects of the schism===
This schism lasted fully ten years, although the antipope found few adherents outside of his own hereditary states, those of Alfonso V of Aragon, of the Swiss confederation and of certain universities. Germany remained neutral; Charles VII of France confined himself to securing to his kingdom (by the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges, which became law on 13 July 1438) the benefit of a great number of the reforms decreed at Basel; England and Italy remained faithful to Eugene IV. Finally, in 1447, Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, after negotiations with Eugene, commanded the burgomaster of Basel not to allow the presence of the council any longer in the imperial city.

===Schism reconciled at Lausanne===
In June 1448 the rump of the council migrated to Lausanne. The antipope, at the insistence of France, ended by abdicating (7 April 1449). Eugene IV died on 23 February 1447, and the council at Lausanne, to save appearances, gave their support to his successor, Pope Nicholas V, who had already been governing the Church for two years. Trustworthy evidence, they said, proved to them that this pontiff accepted the dogma of the superiority of the council as defined at Constance and at Basel.

==Aftermath==
The struggle for East–West union at Ferrara and Florence, while promising, never bore fruit. While progress toward union in the East continued to be made in the following decades, all hopes for a proximate reconciliation were dashed with the fall of Constantinople in 1453. 

Perhaps the council&#x27;s most important historical legacy was the lectures on Greek classical literature given in Florence by many of the delegates from Constantinople, including the neoplatonist Gemistus Pletho. These greatly helped the progress of Renaissance humanism.

<text>The Firth of Forth () is the estuary, or firth, of several Scottish rivers including the River Forth. It meets the North Sea with Fife to its north and Lothian to its south.

==Name==
&quot;Firth&quot; is a cognate of &quot;fjord&quot;, a Norse word meaning a narrow inlet.
&quot;Forth&quot; stems from the name of the river; this is (&#x27;slow running&#x27;) in Proto-Celtic, yielding in Old Gaelic and in Welsh.

It was known as &#x27; in Roman times and was referred to as &#x27; in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;. In the Norse sagas it was known as the . An early Welsh name is , or the &#x27;sea of &#x27;.

==Geography and geology==
Geologically, the Firth of Forth is a fjord, formed by the Forth Glacier in the last glacial period. The drainage basin for the Firth of Forth covers a wide geographic area including places as far from the shore as Ben Lomond, Cumbernauld, Harthill, Penicuik and the edges of Gleneagles Golf Course.

Many towns line the shores, as well as the petrochemical complexes at Grangemouth, commercial docks at Leith, former oil rig construction yards at Methil, the ship breaking facility at Inverkeithing and the former naval dockyard at Rosyth, along with numerous other industrial areas, including the Forth Bridgehead area, encompassing Rosyth, Inverkeithing and the southern edge of Dunfermline, Burntisland, Kirkcaldy, Bo&#x27;ness and Leven.

===Bridges===
The firth is bridged in two areas. The Kincardine Bridge and the Clackmannanshire Bridge cross it at Kincardine, while further east the Forth Bridge, the Forth Road Bridge and the Queensferry Crossing cross from North Queensferry to South Queensferry.

==History==
The Romans reportedly made a bridge of around 900 boats, probably at South Queensferry. The inner firth, located between the Kincardine and Forth bridges, has lost about half of its former intertidal area as a result of land reclamation, partly for agriculture, but mainly for industry and the large ash lagoons built to deposit spoil from the coal-fired Longannet Power Station near Kincardine. Historic villages line the Fife shoreline; Limekilns, Charlestown and Culross, established in the 6th century, where Saint Kentigern was born.

Construction of the Forth Bridge, a railway bridge, began in 1882 and it was opened on 4 March 1890 carrying the Edinburgh–Aberdeen line.

The youngest person to swim across the Firth of Forth was 13-year-old Joseph Feeney, who accomplished the feat in 1933. In October 1936, the Kincardine Bridge opened.

On 4 September 1964, the Forth Road Bridge opened. From 1964 to 1982, a tunnel existed under the Firth of Forth, dug by coal miners to link the Kinneil colliery on the south side of the Forth with the Valleyfield colliery on the north side. This is shown in the 1968 educational film &quot;Forth – Powerhouse for Industry&quot;. The shafts leading into the tunnel were filled and capped with concrete when the tunnel was closed, and it is believed to have filled with water or collapsed in places.

In January 1987, the first Loony Dook event took place and which now takes place annually, during which individuals dive or wade into the Forth on New Years Day.
On 27 February 2001, a Shor 360 operated by the Scottish airline Loganair operating as Flight 670A ditched into the Firth of Forth after both of the plane&#x27;s engines torque went to zero. After a mayday call was initiated the flight went into the water, all happening within the flight&#x27;s phase of climbing to standard altitude. The only 2 occupants aboard - the captain and first officer, died in the accident. The crash was due to a lack of an established procedure for the flight crew to add engine air intake covers in adverse, windy, weather conditions. 

In July 2007, a hovercraft passenger service completed a two-week trial between Portobello, Edinburgh and Kirkcaldy, Fife. The trial of the service (marketed as &quot;Forthfast&quot;) was hailed as a major operational success, with an average passenger load of 85 per cent. It was estimated the service would decrease congestion for commuters on the Forth road and rail bridges by carrying about 870,000 passengers each year. Despite its initial success, the project was cancelled in December 2011.

In 2008, a controversial bid to allow oil transfer between ships in the firth was refused by Forth Ports. SPT Marine Services had asked permission to transfer 7.8 million tonnes of crude oil per year between tankers, but the proposals were met with determined opposition from conservation groups. In November 2008, construction of the Clackmannanshire Bridge was completed and it opened to traffic.

In 2011, construction of the Queensferry Crossing began and the bridge was formally opened on 4 September 2017.
==Ecology==
The firth is important for nature conservation and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The Firth of Forth Islands SPA (Special Protection Area) is home to more than 90,000 breeding seabirds every year. There is a bird observatory on the Isle of May. A series of sand and gravel banks in the approaches to the firth have since 2014 been designated as a Nature Conservation Marine Protected Area under the name Firth of Forth Banks Complex.

The Forth was historically home to a large native population of European Oysters. However, by the 1900s these had been fished to extinction in the Forth. A project to introduce some 30,000 oysters back in the forth has been successful at re-establishing the population in the 21st century.

<text>In cellular biology, active transport is the movement of molecules or ions across a cell membrane from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration—against the concentration gradient. Active transport requires cellular energy to achieve this movement. There are two types of active transport: primary active transport that uses adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and secondary active transport that uses an electrochemical gradient. This process is in contrast to passive transport, which allows molecules or ions to move down their concentration gradient, from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration, with energy.

Active transport is essential for various physiological processes, such as nutrient uptake, hormone secretion, and nig impulse transmission. For example, the sodium-potassium pump uses ATP to pump sodium ions out of the cell and potassium ions into the cell, maintaining a concentration gradient essential for cellular function. Active transport is highly selective and regulated, with different transporters specific to different molecules or ions. Dysregulation of active transport can lead to various disorders, including cystic fibrosis, caused by a malfunctioning chloride channel, and diabetes, resulting from defects in glucose transport into cells.

== Active cellular transportation (ACT) ==

Unlike passive transport, which uses the kinetic energy and natural entropy of molecules moving down a gradient, active transport uses cellular energy to move them against a gradient, polar repulsion, or other resistance. Active transport is usually associated with accumulating high concentrations of molecules that the cell needs, such as ions, glucose and amino acids. Examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose in the intestines in humans and the uptake of mineral ions into root hair cells of plants.

== History ==
In 1848, the German physiologist Emil du Bois-Reymond suggested the possibility of active transport of substances across membranes.

In 1926, Dennis Robert Hoagland investigated the ability of plants to absorb salts against a concentration gradient and discovered the dependence of nutrient absorption and translocation on metabolic energy using innovative model systems under controlled experimental conditions.

Rosenberg (1948) formulated the concept of active transport based on energetic considerations, but later it would be redefined.

In 1997, Jens Christian Skou, a Danish physician received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research regarding the sodium-potassium pump.

One category of cotransporters that is especially prominent in research regarding diabetes treatment is sodium-glucose cotransporters. These transporters were discovered by scientists at the National Health Institute. These scientists had noticed a discrepancy in the absorption of glucose at different points in the kidney tubule of a rat. The gene was then discovered for intestinal glucose transport protein and linked to these membrane sodium glucose cotransport systems. The first of these membrane transport proteins was named SGLT1 followed by the discovery of SGLT2. Robert Krane also played a prominent role in this field.

==Background==
Specialized transmembrane proteins recognize the substance and allow it to move across the membrane when it otherwise would not, either because the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane is impermeable to the substance moved or because the substance is moved against the direction of its concentration gradient. There are two forms of active transport, primary active transport and secondary active transport. In primary active transport, the proteins involved are pumps that normally use chemical energy in the form of ATP. Secondary active transport, however, makes use of potential energy, which is usually derived through exploitation of an electrochemical gradient. The energy created from one ion moving down its electrochemical gradient is used to power the transport of another ion moving against its electrochemical gradient. This involves pore-forming proteins that form channels across the cell membrane. The difference between passive transport and active transport is that the active transport requires energy, and moves substances against their respective concentration gradient, whereas passive transport requires no cellular energy and moves substances in the direction of their respective concentration gradient.

In an antiporter, one substrate is transported in one direction across the membrane while another is cotransported in the opposite direction. In a symporter, two substrates are transported in the same direction across the membrane. Antiport and symport processes are associated with secondary active transport, meaning that one of the two substances is transported against its concentration gradient, utilizing the energy derived from the transport of another ion (mostly Na, K or H ions) down its concentration gradient. 

If substrate molecules are moving from areas of lower concentration to areas of higher concentration (i.e., in the opposite direction as, or &quot;against&quot; the concentration gradient), specific transmembrane carrier proteins are required. These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., glucose) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as &#x27;active&#x27; transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the small intestine.

Plants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute solution. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the concentration gradient. For example, chloride (Cl−) and nitrate (NO3−) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.

==Primary active transport==
Primary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane. Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+. These charged particles require ion pumps or ion channels to cross membranes and distribute through the body. 

Most of the enzymes that perform this type of transport are transmembrane ATPases. A primary ATPase universal to all animal life is the sodium-potassium pump, which helps to maintain the cell potential. The sodium-potassium pump maintains the membrane potential by moving three Na+ ions out of the cell for every two K+ ions moved into the cell. Other sources of energy for primary active transport are redox energy and photon energy (light). An example of primary active transport using redox energy is the mitochondrial electron transport chain that uses the reduction energy of NADH to move protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane against their concentration gradient. An example of primary active transport using light energy are the proteins involved in photosynthesis that use the energy of photons to create a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane and also to create reduction power in the form of NADPH. 

===Model of active transport===

ATP hydrolysis is used to transport hydrogen ions against the electrochemical gradient (from low to high hydrogen ion concentration). Phosphorylation of the carrier protein and the binding of a hydrogen ion induce a conformational (shape) change that drives the hydrogen ions to transport against the electrochemical gradient. Hydrolysis of the bound phosphate group and release of hydrogen ion then restores the carrier to its original conformation.

== Types of primary active transporters ==

# P-type ATPase: sodium potassium pump, calcium pump, proton pump
# F-ATPase: mitochondrial ATP synthase, chloroplast ATP synthase
# V-ATPase: vacuolar ATPase
# ABC (ATP binding cassette) transporter: MDR, CFTR, etc.

Adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) comprise a large and diverse protein family, often functioning as ATP-driven pumps. Usually, there are several domains involved in the overall transporter protein&#x27;s structure, including two nucleotide-binding domains that constitute the ATP-binding motif and two hydrophobic transmembrane domains that create the &quot;pore&quot; component. In broad terms, ABC transporters are involved in the import or export of molecules across a cell membrane; yet within the protein family there is an extensive range of function.

In plants, ABC transporters are often found within cell and organelle membranes, such as the mitochondria, chloroplast, and plasma membrane. There is evidence to support that plant ABC transporters play a direct role in pathogen response, phytohormone transport, and detoxification. Furthermore, certain plant ABC transporters may function in actively exporting volatile compounds and antimicrobial metabolites.

In petunia flowers (&quot;Petunia hybrida&quot;), the ABC transporter PhABCG1 is involved in the active transport of volatile organic compounds. PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers. In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased &quot;PhABCG1&quot; expression levels. In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed &quot;PhABCG1&quot; to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benzyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.

Additionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in &quot;Nicotiana tabacum&quot; BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors. NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant. Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization. Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.

==Secondary active transport==
In secondary active transport, also known as cotransport or coupled transport, energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to primary active transport, there is no direct coupling of ATP. Instead, it relies upon the electrochemical potential difference created by pumping ions in/out of the cell. Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated, increases entropy and can serve as a source of energy for metabolism (e.g. in ATP synthase). The energy derived from the pumping of protons across a cell membrane is frequently used as the energy source in secondary active transport. In humans, sodium (Na+) is a commonly cotransported ion across the plasma membrane, whose electrochemical gradient is then used to power the active transport of a second ion or molecule against its gradient. In bacteria and small yeast cells, a commonly cotransported ion is hydrogen. Hydrogen pumps are also used to create an electrochemical gradient to carry out processes within cells such as in the electron transport chain, an important function of cellular respiration that happens in the mitochondrion of the cell.

In August 1960, in Prague, Robert K. Crane presented for the first time his discovery of the sodium-glucose cotransport as the mechanism for intestinal glucose absorption. Crane&#x27;s discovery of cotransport was the first ever proposal of flux coupling in biology.

Cotransporters can be classified as symporters and antiporters depending on whether the substances move in the same or opposite directions.

===Antiporter===

In an antiporter two species of ions or other solutes are pumped in opposite directions across a membrane. One of these species is allowed to flow from high to low concentration, which yields the entropic energy to drive the transport of the other solute from a low concentration region to a high one.

An example is the sodium-calcium exchanger or antiporter, which allows three sodium ions into the cell to transport one calcium out. This antiporter mechanism is important within the membranes of cardiac muscle cells in order to keep the calcium concentration in the cytoplasm low. Many cells also possess calcium ATPases, which can operate at lower intracellular concentrations of calcium and sets the normal or resting concentration of this important second messenger. But the ATPase exports calcium ions more slowly: only 30 per second versus 2000 per second by the exchanger. The exchanger comes into service when the calcium concentration rises steeply or &quot;spikes&quot; and enables rapid recovery. This shows that a single type of ion can be transported by several enzymes, which need not be active all the time (constitutively), but may exist to meet specific, intermittent needs.

=== Symporter ===

A symporter uses the downhill movement of one solute species from high to low concentration to move another molecule uphill from low concentration to high concentration (against its concentration gradient). Both molecules are transported in the same direction.

An example is the glucose symporter SGLT1, which co-transports one glucose (or galactose) molecule into the cell for every two sodium ions it imports into the cell. This symporter is located in the small intestines, heart, and brain. It is also located in the S3 segment of the proximal tubule in each nephron in the kidneys. Its mechanism is exploited in glucose rehydration therapy This mechanism uses the absorption of sugar through the walls of the intestine to pull water in along with it. Defects in SGLT2 prevent effective reabsorption of glucose, causing familial renal glucosuria.

==Bulk transport==
Endocytosis and exocytosis are both forms of bulk transport that move materials into and out of cells, respectively, via vesicles. In the case of endocytosis, the cellular membrane folds around the desired materials outside the cell. The ingested particle becomes trapped within a pouch, known as a vesicle, inside the cytoplasm. Often enzymes from lysosomes are then used to digest the molecules absorbed by this process. Substances that enter the cell via signal mediated electrolysis include proteins, hormones and growth and stabilization factors. Viruses enter cells through a form of endocytosis that involves their outer membrane fusing with the membrane of the cell. This forces the viral DNA into the host cell.

Biologists distinguish two main types of endocytosis: pinocytosis and phagocytosis.
* In pinocytosis, cells engulf liquid particles (in humans this process occurs in the small intestine, where cells engulf fat droplets).
* In phagocytosis, cells engulf solid particles.

Exocytosis involves the removal of substances through the fusion of the outer cell membrane and a vesicle membrane. An example of exocytosis would be the transmission of neurotransmitters across a synapse between brain cells.

<doc id="144607" wikidata="Q933000" url="?curid=144607" title="Forth Road Bridge">
<text>The Forth Road Bridge is a suspension bridge in east central Scotland. The bridge opened in 1964 and at the time was the longest suspension bridge in the world outside the United States. The bridge spans the Firth of Forth, connecting Edinburgh, at South Queensferry, to Fife, at North Queensferry. It replaced a centuries-old ferry service to carry vehicular traffic, cyclists and pedestrians across the Forth; railway crossings are made by the nearby Forth Bridge, opened in 1890.

The Scottish Parliament voted to scrap tolls on the bridge from February 2008. The adjacent Queensferry Crossing was opened in August 2017 to carry the M90 motorway across the Firth of Forth, replacing the Forth Road Bridge which had exceeded its design capacity. At its peak, the Forth Road Bridge carried 65,000 vehicles per day.

The Forth Road Bridge was subsequently closed for repairs and refurbishment. It reopened in February 2018, now redesignated as a dedicated Public Transport Corridor, with access to motor vehicles other than buses and taxis restricted; pedestrians and cyclists are still permitted to use the bridge. In May 2023, Stagecoach Fife started the first driverless bus service to carry passengers in the United Kingdom along a park-and-ride route which includes the Forth Road Bridge as its main section.

==History==
The first crossing at the site of the bridge was established in the 11th century by Margaret, queen consort of King Malcolm III, who founded a ferry service to transport religious pilgrims from Edinburgh to Dunfermline Abbey and St Andrews. Its creation gave rise to the port towns of Queensferry and North Queensferry, which remain to this day; the passenger ferry service continued without interruption for over 800 years. There were proposals as early as the 1740s for a road crossing at the site, although its viability was only considered after the Forth Bridge was built in 1890.

The importance of the crossing for vehicular traffic was underpinned when the Great Britain road numbering scheme was drawn up in the 1920s. The planners wished the arterial A9 road to be routed across the Forth here, although the unwillingness to have a ferry crossing as part of this route led to the A90 number being assigned instead.

There was more lobbying for a road crossing in the 1920s and 1930s, when the only vehicle crossing was a single passenger and vehicle ferry. Sir William Denny championed the expansion of that service in the 1930s, providing and operating on behalf of the London and North Eastern Railway two additional ferries to supplement the nearby railway bridge. Due to their success, two more ferry boats were added in the 1940s and 1950s, by which time the ferries were making 40,000 crossings annually, carrying 1.5 million passengers and 800,000 vehicles.

===Design===
With the then newest and nearest bridge spanning the Forth (the Kincardine Bridge, built in 1936) still around upstream, the upsurge in demand for a road crossing between Edinburgh and Fife prompted the UK Government to establish the Forth Road Bridge Joint Board (FRBJB) by Act of Parliament in 1947 to oversee the implementation of a new bridge to replace the ferry service. The authorities on both sides investigated in 1955, and drew up an alternative scheme for a tunnel beneath the estuary. This was known as the Maunsell Scheme, and was projected to run somewhat closer to the rail bridge than the present road bridge. The scheme was abandoned as too ambitious, and a bridge was built instead.

===Construction===

The final construction plan was accepted in February 1958 and work began that September. Mott, Hay and Anderson and Freeman Fox &amp; Partners carried out the design work and a joint venture of Sir William Arrol &amp; Co., Cleveland Bridge &amp; Engineering Company and Dorman Long constructed the bridge at a cost of £15.1 million. The resident design engineer was John Alexander King Hamilton FRSE (1900–1982).

It was the longest steel suspension bridge in Europe. It used 210,000 tons of concrete, with of grade-separated dual-carriageway approach roads. Reed &amp; Mallik built the approach viaducts.

Twenty-four individual bridges were built for the approach roads. The southern approach road of the A90 began at Cramond Bridge, over the River Almond on the western outskirts of Edinburgh, near Craigiehall. There were two-level interchanges built at Burnshot, Dolphington (B924) and the Echline junction (A904 and B800). At Dalmeny there was a bridge over the railway. The southern approach roads were built by A.M. Carmichael Ltd. The northern approach road had three two-level junctions at Ferry Toll (for the B980), Admiralty (for Rosyth Dockyard via the A985, and Inverkeithing via the A921) and at Mastertown/Masterton (for what would be the fledgling M90 southern terminus). The Masterton junction was an octopus junction, a variation of a clover-leaf junction, with six bridges and a 600 ft viaduct. There were fifteen bridges built for this approach road. The northern approach road terminated as the A823(M) at a roundabout with the A823 south of Dunfermline, next to Rosyth railway station. The northern approach roads were built by Whatlings Ltd of Glasgow, later bought by Alfred McAlpine.

Seven people died during construction before the bridge was opened by Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh on 4 September 1964. The ferry service was discontinued as of that date.

===Operation===
The bridge&#x27;s management was delegated to the FRBJB, and remained so until 2002 when its operation was transferred to a new body with a wider remit, the Forth Estuary Transport Authority.

On 1 December 2010, the bridge was closed for the first time due to heavy snow. After several accidents meant snowploughs were unable to clear the carriageways, the bridge was closed in both directions at 6.40 a.m. and remained closed for several hours.

As part of celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the bridge&#x27;s operation, artist Kate Downie was commissioned to create a print of the bridge and hold an exhibition of works portraying it.

On 1 June 2015, Amey took over the maintenance and operating of the bridge on behalf of Transport Scotland from the Forth Estuary Transport Authority, and are now called the Forth Bridges Unit.

===Structural issues===
Forth Estuary Transport Authority (FETA) began to be concerned over the structural wear of the bridge in the early years of the 21st century. The planned theoretical capacity for the bridge (30,000 vehicles per day in each direction) was routinely exceeded as traffic levels outstripped predictions. The Scottish Government stated in 2006 that 60,000 vehicles travelled on more than half the days in a year. This raised concerns about the lifespan of the bridge, originally planned at 120 years.

In 2003, an inspection programme was launched (costing £1.2 million) to assess the condition of the main suspension cables after corrosion was discovered in a number of older bridges in the United States of a similar design and size. The study was completed two years later and reported that the main cables had suffered an 8%–10% loss of strength. This weakening was projected to accelerate, with traffic restrictions to limit loading required in 2014 in the worst-case scenario, followed by full closure by 2020.

An acoustic monitoring system was commissioned in August 2006, using listening devices to monitor any further strands snapping and pinpoint their location within the main cables. In January 2006, the Scottish Executive completed a third-party audit on the bridge which concluded that FETA had performed the initial internal inspection and cable strength calculation in accordance with accepted practice. The report suggested that traffic restrictions could be required by 2013.

Several actions were taken to increase the bridge&#x27;s lifespan. These included a dehumidification programme that slowed the rate of corrosion in the main cables by keeping air in the voids between the main cables&#x27; strands below 40% humidity. Engineering consultants Faber Maunsell began work on the project in 2006; it took two and a half years to complete at a cost of £7.8 million. As part of the works, some of the corroded cable strands were spliced.

The southbound carriageway of the bridge was closed on 1 December 2015, with all traffic using a single lane each way on the northbound carriageway after steelwork defects had been discovered during routine inspections, and traffic was restricted to 7.5 tonnes or less (public service vehicles excepted). On 4 December, the bridge was fully closed when further structural faults were found. It was initially not expected to reopen until January 2016, and Transport Scotland began work to lay on extra trains and buses and considered whether to reintroduce a ferry service to mitigate the impact on travellers.

On 23 December, the bridge was reopened for all traffic except heavy goods vehicles (HGVs). On 4 February, it was announced this had been pushed back to March, due to further problems with the truss end link pins in the southern towers, which required additional remedial work. However, a limited number of HGVs were allowed to cross, in a northbound direction only, between 11 pm and 4 am each night. On 20 February 2016, the bridge was fully reopened.

====2016 public inquiry====

On 20 January 2016, the Scottish Parliament began an inquiry led by the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee (ICI) to determine the circumstances that led to the discovery of a cracked truss in the bridge&#x27;s undercarriage. Evidence was heard from FETA, Transport Minister Derek Mackay, engineers and officials from Amey along with a number of other experts and key personnel.

On the first day, Richard Hornby, of engineering consulting firm Arup, stated that the truss end in question had been inspected 23 times since 2001, and no fault had been found. It was revealed that a pin had seized up, which caused the truss end to crack, and it was only the quality of the steel which had stopped its cracking appearing earlier. Hornby also made clear that even if the seized pin had been picked up earlier, it was &quot;virtually impossible&quot; to lubricate the bearing. Several witnesses defended a decision by previous operator FETA not to proceed with a £15 million truss end link replacement project in 2010. This was disputed by Barry Colford, former chief engineer and bridgemaster at FETA. Lesley Hinds, FETA&#x27;s former convener, pointed out that the bridge budget had been cut by 58% in 2011, while senior staff at FETA had &quot;deep concerns&quot; about the transfer of bridge management to a private company.

===New crossings and change of use===
The strategic transport importance of the road bridge and the threat of closure by 2020 if major structural work were not undertaken led to fears of serious economic consequences. Increasing traffic levels across the Firth of Forth had also led to the construction of the Clackmannanshire Bridge adjacent to the existing Kincardine Bridge. This bridge opened in November 2008.

Proposals for a second road crossing at Queensferry had been made in the 1990s, but were shelved, despite preliminary work on route selection. Following the discovery of potentially serious structural issues with the Forth Road Bridge in 2005 the proposals were revisited and plans advanced. The decision to proceed with a replacement bridge was taken at the end of 2007, and it was announced the following year that the existing bridge would be retained as a public transport link. The Forth Crossing Act received Royal Assent in January 2011, and the new bridge was opened in late 2017.

On 1 February 2018, the Forth Road Bridge became a Public Transport Corridor, with all approach roads in full operation. The bridge was closed between September and mid October 2017 for roadworks before partially reopening for public buses.

As of December 2020, work was underway that would allow the Forth Road Bridge to become an emergency diversion route for private transport. The Queensferry Crossing has proofing that makes it less vulnerable to high winds than the Forth Road Bridge, but it was closed for the first time in February 2020 due to accumulations of ice on its towers.

====Driverless buses====

On 22 November 2018, it was announced that £4.35 million of funding had been secured for the United Kingdom&#x27;s first passenger-carrying driverless bus trial, planned to take place across the Forth Road Bridge public transport corridor by 2021. Five brand new autonomous 42-seater Alexander Dennis Enviro200AV single-decker buses, with autonomous control modifications supplied by Fusion Processing, are operated by Stagecoach Fife on a park-and-ride route in mixed traffic at up to between Inverkeithing, on the north side of the Forth, and Edinburgh Park Transport Exchange, across the bridge. The service has two members of staff onboard – for operational reasons and to comply with UK legislation, a safety driver is still present in the cab to monitor the technology, but they do not operate the vehicle other than in exceptional circumstances. A &#x27;captain&#x27; takes tickets and answers questions. The service started on 15 May 2023 and runs on a frequent timetable with capacity anticipated to be around 10,000 passenger journeys a week.

==Statistics==
The bridge&#x27;s central main span is long, its two side spans are each long, and the approach viaducts are on the north side and on the south side. The total length is . It was the longest suspension bridge span outside the United States and the fourth-longest span in the world at the time of its construction. The bridge is made of 39,000 tonnes of steel and 115,000 cubic metres of concrete. The towers reach above mean water level. There is a dual carriageway road with two lanes in each direction, and cycle/footpaths on each side. The main strung cables are in diameter, with 11,618 high tensile wires, each five millimetres in diameter, and each cable carries 13,800 tonnes of the bridge&#x27;s load.

The bridge formed a crucial part of the corridor between south-east and north-east Scotland, linking Edinburgh to Perth, Dundee and Aberdeen by the A90 road and its sister M90 motorway, which used to begin north of the bridge&#x27;s northern end. The bridge carried around 2.5 million vehicles in its first year, increasing to around 21.4 million vehicles in 2008. The bridge carried its 250 millionth vehicle in 2002.

It was awarded Historic Scotland&#x27;s Category A listed structure status in 2001.

==Tolls==
On 11 February 2008, tolls were abolished on the bridge by The Scottish Government.

Initially, it was suggested that tolls would cease once the original cost of construction (plus accrued interest) was repaid. This was achieved in 1993, and it was planned that tolls would not be levied after May 1995. Instead, legislation enabling the continued levying of tolls was renewed by Parliament (originally that of the UK but now the Scottish Parliament) in 1998, 2003 and 2006.

Originally, a toll was paid for each direction of travel, with sets of tollbooths on both carriageways. In 1997, the northbound toll was doubled (from 40p to 80p) and the southbound toll abolished on the presumption that almost all traffic makes a return journey across the bridge, and that the removal of the southbound toll would result in a reduction of congestion without reducing revenue.

FETA said the continued charging of tolls was necessary to fund maintenance and improvement works. These included the construction of defences around the submerged piers forming the bases of the main towers to guard against collisions. The main towers were also strengthened with internal steel columns (the original tower structure was hollow) and had hydraulic rams jack up these sections to transfer a portion of the load to the new steelwork. Also, the vertical cables suspending the deck had their bolts replaced after a detected failure. A new paint system required development for the bridge (the original was phased out due to environmental concerns).

===Variable tolling proposals===
In late-2005, FETA&#x27;s committee approved a proposed revamp of the tolls. The minimum toll would stay fixed at £1, but higher tolls would be charged at some times of day, with a maximum of £4 during evening rush hours. All tolls would be halved for cars with more than one occupant, as an incentive for motorists to share cars and make fewer journeys. According to FETA&#x27;s chairman Lawrence Marshall, the system would provide the most efficiency; he said that 80% of peak-time journeys are made by single-occupant vehicles. The proposal, passed with the chairman&#x27;s casting vote after the committee was deadlocked, was referred to the Scottish Executive in December 2005, and implementation planned for October 2007 subject to approval by Transport Minister Tavish Scott. Environmental groups welcomed the proposal, but local politicians condemned it as simply a means of raising capital. At the same time, Fife councillors counter-proposed the complete removal of tolls.

The Scottish Parliament debated the proposals in January 2006, and the affair became a major political issue after UK Cabinet Ministers Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling (Chancellor of the Exchequer and Secretary of State for Scotland respectively) were seen to describe the variable tolling plan as &quot;dead in the water&quot;. Scottish First Minister Jack McConnell insisted his Labour Party colleagues were misquoted, and refused to rule out the plan, receiving criticism from the opposition Scottish National Party.

There was a by-election on 9 February 2006 for Dunfermline and West Fife, the constituency in which the north end of the bridge is situated. It was contested (in addition to the major political parties in Scotland) by an Abolish Forth Bridge Tolls Party. Liberal Democrat candidate Willie Rennie won the election, overturning a large Labour majority on a 16% swing. Afterwards, media speculated that the Executive had turned against the proposals, and Tavish Scott eventually confirmed their rejection and the retention of the existing toll structure on 1 March 2006. FETA condemned the decision, while local opposition MSPs charged the Minister that his tolling review short-changed Fifers as tolls were axed on the Erskine Bridge, leaving tolls on just the Forth and Tay Road Bridges.

===Abolition===
When an SNP minority government was formed after the Scottish parliamentary election of May 2007, a new debate on the abolition of tolls was opened by Transport Minister Stewart Stevenson on 31 May 2007, and the abolition was agreed by a large majority. Annual toll income at that point totalled £16,000,000.

The Abolition of Bridge Tolls (Scotland) Bill was introduced in the Scottish Parliament on 3 September 2007, passed on 20 December 2007, and received royal assent on 24 January 2008. The tolls were removed on 11 February 2008 at 00:01 GMT. The abolition of the tolls was enacted immediately after a major reconstruction of the northbound toll plaza was completed.

== Suicides ==
In 2011, it was stated that around 800 people had fallen to their deaths since the bridge had opened. A report in 2000 stated that prior to then, four people had survived falling from the bridge.

<doc id="144608" wikidata="Q193556" url="?curid=144608" title="Provinces of Sweden">
<text>The 25 provinces of [[Sweden]] () are historical, geographical and cultural regions. They have no administrative function (except in some sports contexts), but retain their own cultural identities, dialects and folklore.

Several were administrative subdivisions until 1634, when they were replaced by the counties of Sweden (). Some were conquered later on from Denmark–Norway. Others, like the provinces of Finland, have been lost.

In some cases, the county and province borders correspond almost exactly, as with Blekinge and Blekinge County. The island of Gotland is both a province, a county and a municipality (&quot;kommun&quot;). The only other province to share a name with a modern municipality is Härjedalen, though the borders are not quite the same. Administrative borders are subject to change – for example, several of today&#x27;s counties were created in the 1990s – while the provincial borders have remained stable for centuries. All the provinces are also ceremonial duchies, but as such have no administrative or political functions.

Nevertheless, the provinces of Sweden are no archaic concept; they are still referenced in everyday speech and seen as culturally distinct. The main exception is Lapland, where people see themselves as citizens of Västerbotten or Norrbotten, based on the counties.

Sweden&#x27;s two largest cities, Stockholm and Gothenburg, both have provincial borders running through them: Stockholm is split between Uppland and Södermanland, and Gothenburg is split between Västergötland and Bohuslän. According to a 2011 survey, people in major cities – Stockholm, Gothenburg and, to a lesser extent, Malmö – identify primarily with their city, rather than their province.

== Provinces ==

English and other languages occasionally use Latin names for the Swedish provinces. The name &quot;Scania&quot; for Skåne predominates in English. Some English exonyms, such as &quot;the Dales&quot; for Dalarna, &quot;East Gothland&quot; for Östergötland, &quot;Swedish Lapland&quot; for Lappland and &quot;West Bothnia&quot; for Västerbotten are common in English literature. Swedes writing in English have long used the Swedish names only.

== History ==

The origins of the provincial divisions lay in the petty kingdoms that gradually became more and more subjected to the central monarchy during the consolidation of Sweden. Until the country law of Magnus Eriksson in 1350, each of these lands still had its own laws and its own assembly (the thing), and in effect governed itself. The first provinces were considered duchies, but newly conquered provinces received the status of duchy or county, depending on importance.

After the separation from the Kalmar Union in 1523, the Kingdom incorporated only some of its new conquests as provinces. The most permanent acquisitions stemmed from the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, in which the former Danish Scanian lands (Skåne, Blekinge, Halland and Gotland), along with the Norwegian Bohuslän, Jämtland and Härjedalen, became Swedish and gradually integrated. Other foreign territories were ruled as Swedish Dominions under the Swedish monarch, in some cases for centuries. (Norway, in personal union with Sweden from 1814 to 1905, never became an integral part of Sweden.)

When Sweden ceded Finland to the Russian Empire in 1809, Västerbotten was divided up so that Norrbotten first emerged as a county. Eventually, it came to be recognized as its own province. It was granted a coat of arms as late as in 1995.

Some scholars suggest that Sweden revived the concept of provinces in the 19th century.

=== The lands of Sweden===
Historically, Sweden was seen as containing four ”lands” (larger regions):
* Götaland (southern Sweden)
* Svealand (central Sweden)
* Österland (Finland, from the 13th century to 1809)
* Norrland (northern parts of present-day Sweden and north-western Finland)

In the Viking Age and earlier, Götaland and Svealand were home to a number of petty kingdoms that were more or less independent; Götaland in the Iron Age and Middle Ages did not include Scania and other provinces in the far south, which were then part of Denmark. The leading tribe of Götaland in the Iron Age was the Geats; the main tribe of Svealand, according to Tacitus ca 100 AD, was the Suiones (or the ”historical Swedes”). ”Norrland” was all the unexplored northern parts, the boundaries and Swedish control over which were weakly defined into the early modern age.

Due to the Northern Crusades against Finns, Tavastians and Karelians and colonisation of some coastal areas of the country, Finland fell under the Catholic Church and Swedish rule. &quot;Österland&quot; (&quot;Eastern land&quot;; the name had early gone out of use) in southern and central Finland formed an integral part of Sweden. Russia annexed Finland in 1809, and reunited it with some frontier counties annexed earlier to form the Grand Duchy of Finland. In 1917, Finland became an independent country.

The regional borders have changed several times throughout history with changing national borders. Norrland, Svealand and Götaland are only &quot;parts&quot; of Sweden, and have never superseded the concept of the provinces.

== Heraldry ==
At the funeral of King Gustav Vasa (Gustav I) in 1560, arms for 23 of the provinces were displayed together for the first time, most of them created for that occasion. Erik XIV of Sweden modelled the funeral processions on those of German dukes, who in turn may have styled their displays after Emperor Charles V&#x27;s funeral, where a host of banners represented each entry in the King&#x27;s long list of titles. Gustav Vasa&#x27;s title only had three entries – &quot;King of Sweden, the Goths and the Wends&quot; – so banners were created for each Swedish province for a better display.

Some of these arms were short-lived, such as the beaver for Medelpad (changed in the 1570s), the wolverine for Värmland (changed in 1567) and the roses on Småland’s arms. Östergötland was represented by two different arms, one with a &quot;Västanstång&quot; dragon and one with a &quot;Östanstång&quot; lion. The current arms for Östergötland (see below) were created in 1884.

The current arms for Småland were created for the coronation of John III in 1569. The wild man representing Lappland was created for the funeral of Charles IX in 1612. Arms for Jämtland were created when Norway ceded the province to Sweden in 1635. Arms for Härjedalen were created later. The arms for Blekinge, Bohuslän, Halland and Skåne were created for the funeral of Charles X Gustav in 1660. The Arms for Norrbotten were created as late as 1995.

=== Götaland ===
Götaland (&quot;Gothia&quot;, &quot;Gothenland&quot;) comprises ten provinces in the southern part of Sweden. Until 1645, Gotland and Halland were parts of Denmark. Also, until 1658 Blekinge and Scania were parts of Denmark, and Bohuslän was part of Norway. Värmland was counted as part of Götaland until 1812.

=== Svealand ===
Svealand (&quot;Swealand&quot;) comprises six provinces in central Sweden. Until 1812, Värmland was counted as part of Götaland instead.

=== Norrland ===
Norrland (&quot;Northland&quot;) today comprises nine provinces in Northern and central Sweden. Until 1645 the provinces of Jämtland and Härjedalen were parts of Norway. In 1809, when Sweden ceded Finland to the Russian Empire, the old province of Lapland was split into Swedish Lapland and Finnish Lapland. Norrbotten was separated from Västerbotten at the same time, and developed its own provincial identity during the 19th century.

<text>The French National Centre for Scientific Research (, ; CNRS) is the French state research organisation and is the largest fundamental science agency in Europe.

In 2016, it employed 31,637 staff, including 11,137 tenured researchers, 13,415 engineers and technical staff, and 7,085 contractual workers. It is headquartered in Paris and has administrative offices in Brussels, Beijing, Tokyo, Singapore, Washington, D.C., Bonn, Moscow, Tunis, Johannesburg, Santiago de Chile, Israel, and New Delhi.

== Organization ==
The CNRS operates on the basis of research units, which are of two kinds: &quot;proper units&quot; (UPRs) are operated solely by the CNRS, and Joint Research Units (UMRs – ) are run in association with other institutions, such as universities or INSERM. Members of Joint Research Units may be either CNRS researchers or university employees (&quot;maîtres de conférences&quot; or &quot;professeurs&quot;). Each research unit has a numeric code attached and is typically headed by a university professor or a CNRS research director. A research unit may be subdivided into research groups (&quot;équipes&quot;). The CNRS also has support units, which may, for instance, supply administrative, computing, library, or engineering services.

In 2016, the CNRS had 952 Joint Research Units, 32 proper research units, 135 service units, and 36 international units.

The CNRS is divided into 10 national institutes:
* Institute of Chemistry (INC)
* Institute of Ecology and Environment (INEE)
* Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics (IN2P3)
* Institute of Biological Sciences (INSB)
* Institute for Humanities and Social Sciences (INSHS)
* Institute for Computer Sciences (INS2I)
* Institute for Engineering and Systems Sciences (INSIS)
* Institute for Mathematical Sciences (INSMI)
* Institute for Earth Sciences and Astronomy (INSU)

The National Committee for Scientific Research, which is in charge of the recruitment and evaluation of researchers, is divided into 47 sections (e.g. Section 41 is mathematics, Section 7 is computer science and control, and so on). Research groups are affiliated with one primary institute and an optional secondary institute; the researchers themselves belong to one section. For administrative purposes, the CNRS is divided into 18 regional divisions (including four for the Paris region).
== Employment ==
Researchers who are permanent employees of the CNRS, equivalent to lifelong research fellows in English-speaking countries, are classified in two categories, each subdivided into two or three classes, and each class is divided into several pay grades.

In principle, research directors tend to head research groups, but this is not a general rule (a research scientist can head a group or even a laboratory and some research directors do not head a group).

Employees for support activities include research engineers, studies engineers, assistant engineers and technicians. Contrary to what the name would seem to imply, these can have administrative duties (e.g. a secretary can be &quot;technician&quot;, an administrative manager of a laboratory an &quot;assistant engineer&quot;).

Following a 1983 reform, the candidates selected have the status of civil servants and are part of the public service.

== Recruitment ==
All permanent support employees are recruited through annual nationwide competitive campaigns (&quot;&quot;). Separate competitives campaigns are held in each of the forty disciplinary fields covered by the institution and organized in sections. In the context of the competition, the section is made up of an eligibility jury, which reads the application files, selects some for the orals, holds the orals, and draws up a ranked list of potential candidates, submitted to the admission jury, which validates (or not) this ranking; the admission jury can make adjustments within this list. At the end of the admissions jury, the results are announced.

The competition is governed by very strict, well-defined legal rules, including the sovereignty and impartiality of the jury and the rules governing conflicts of interest: candidates are strictly forbidden to have any contact with a member of the jury, and no one may put pressure on the jury in any way whatsoever. If a member of the jury belongs to the candidate&#x27;s family, he or she may not sit on the jury. The same applies if a candidate has worked extensively with one of the jury members over the past two years, or has a direct and regular relationship with him or her.

In 2020, the average age at recruitment was 33.9 years for (research fellows), with wide variations between sections (in the humanities and social sciences, it was 36.3 years). 

In 2020, the average recruitment rate was 21.3 applicants for each single open position, again with variations to this rate between sections. The most competitive sections are usually Section 2 (theoretical physics), Section 35 (literature, philosophy and philology), Section 36 (sociology and law), and Section 40 (political science). In 2023, in Section 35, there were 158 applicants for four open positions, hence a recruitment rate of 2.53%. By comparison, Section 12 (molecular chemistry) received 33 applications for five open positions.

== History ==
The CNRS was created on 19 October 1939 by decree of President Albert Lebrun. Since 1954, the centre has annually awarded gold, silver, and bronze medals to French scientists and junior researchers. In 1966, the organisation underwent structural changes, which resulted in the creation of two specialised institutes: the National Astronomy and Geophysics Institute in 1967 (which became the National Institute of Sciences of the Universe in 1985) and the &quot;Institut national de physique nucléaire et de physique des particules&quot; (IN2P3; English: National Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics) in 1971.

==Reform proposals==
The effectiveness of the recruitment, compensation, career management, and evaluation procedures of CNRS have been under scrutiny. Governmental projects include the transformation of the CNRS into an organization allocating support to research projects on an ad hoc basis and the reallocation of CNRS researchers to universities. Another controversial plan advanced by the government involves breaking up the CNRS into six separate institutes. These modifications, which were again proposed in 2021 by think tanks such as the Institut Montaigne, have been massively rejected by French scientists, leading to multiple protests. Important reforms were also recommended in the 2023 assessment report of the HCERES.

<text>His Master&#x27;s Voice is an entertainment trademark, derived from the painting of the same name that depicts a dog named Nipper listening to a wind-up disc gramophone whilst tilting his head, created in 1899 by Francis Barraud.

In December 1899, the painting was sold to William Barry Owen of London&#x27;s Gramophone Company (later a division of EMI), using the imagery on its sound equipment. It would create the His Master&#x27;s Voice record label in 1909, and the HMV retail chain in 1921. The Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA Victor), the American affiliate of the Gramophone Company, also adopted the name and imagery on its products and advertising, beginning in 1901.

With the Gramophone Company and RCA Victor both eventually operating outside of their respective countries, the His Master&#x27;s Voice painting became one of the world&#x27;s best-known trademarks, featured on sound equipment, music releases and retail stores worldwide. Some international divisions would later be divested, leading to the ownership of the &#x27;His Master&#x27;s Voice&#x27; brand to be fragmented.

== History ==
The phrase was coined in the late 1890s from the title of a painting by English artist Francis Barraud, which depicted a dog named Nipper listening to a wind-up disc gramophone and tilting his head. In the original, unmodified 1898 painting, the dog was listening to a cylinder phonograph.

In early 1899, Francis Barraud applied for copyright of the original painting using the descriptive working title &quot;Dog looking at and listening to a Phonograph&quot;. He was unable to sell the work to any cylinder phonograph company. The painting had been originally offered to James Hough, manager of Edison-Bell in London, but he declined, saying &quot;dogs don&#x27;t listen to phonographs&quot;. William Barry Owen, the American founder of the Gramophone Company in England, offered to purchase the painting for £100, under the condition that Barraud modify it to show one of their disc machines. Barraud complied and the image was first used on the company&#x27;s catalogue from December 1899. As the trademark gained in popularity, several additional copies were subsequently commissioned from the artist for various corporate purposes.

In June 2003, the formal His Master&#x27;s Voice trademark transfer took place from EMI Records to HMV Media Group plc. In January 2013, HMV Group plc would later be rescued by Hilco Capital, who retained the His Master&#x27;s Voice trademark rights when they sold the HMV stores to Sunrise Records. 

In January 2017, Warner Music Group launched Warner Classics digital efforts as &#x27;Dog and Trumpet&#x27; due to not having the &#x27;His Master&#x27;s Voice&#x27; trademark rights. Most reissues of former His Master&#x27;s Voice-pop material previously controlled by EMI are now re-issued on Warner&#x27;s Parlophone label.

<doc id="144612" wikidata="Q151445" url="?curid=144612" title="Bass Rock">
<text>The Bass Rock, or simply the Bass (), ( or ) is an island in the outer part of the Firth of Forth in the east of Scotland. Approximately offshore, and north-east of North Berwick, it is a steep-sided volcanic plug, at its highest point, and is home to a large colony of gannets. The rock is uninhabited, but historically has been settled by an 8th-century Christian hermit, and later was the site of an important castle, which after the Commonwealth period was used as a prison. The island belongs to Hew Hamilton-Dalrymple, whose family acquired it in 1706, and previously to the Lauder family for almost six centuries. The Bass Rock Lighthouse was constructed on the rock in 1902, and the remains of a chapel survive.

The Bass Rock features in many works of fiction, including Lion Let Loose by Nigel Tranter, &quot;Catriona&quot; by Robert Louis Stevenson, &quot;The Lion Is Rampant&quot; by the Scottish novelist Ross Laidlaw and &quot;The New Confessions&quot; by William Boyd. Most recently it features prominently in &quot;The Bass Rock&quot; by Evie Wyld, which won the 2021 Stella Prize.

==Geography and geology==
The island is a volcanic plug of phonolitic trachyte rock of Carboniferous (Dinantian) age. The rock was first recognised as an igneous intrusion by James Hutton. Hugh Miller visited in 1847 and wrote about the rock&#x27;s geology in his book &quot;Edinburgh and its Neighbourhood, Geological and Historical: with The Geology of the Bass Rock&quot;. It is one of a small number of islands off the East Lothian coast including the Islands of the Forth. To the west are Craigleith, and the Lamb, Fidra and finally to the west of Fidra, the low-lying island of Eyebroughy. These are also mainly the result of volcanic activity. To the northeast can be seen the Isle of May off the coast of the East Neuk of Fife.

Bass Rock stands more than high in the Firth of Forth Islands Special Protection Area which covers some but not all of the islands in the inner and outer Firth. The Bass Rock is a Site of Special Scientific Interest in its own right, due to its gannet colony. It is sometimes called &quot;the Ailsa Craig of the East&quot;. It is of a similar age (c.340 million years), geological form and petrology to nearby North Berwick Law, a hill on the mainland and to Traprain Law. There are related volcanic formations on the adjacent island of Craigleith and within nearby Edinburgh, namely Arthur&#x27;s Seat, Calton Hill and Castle Rock.

The Bass does not occupy the skyline of the Firth quite as much as its equivalent in the Clyde, Ailsa Craig, but it can be seen from much of southern and eastern Fife, most of East Lothian, and high points in the Lothians and Borders, such as Arthur&#x27;s Seat, and the Lammermuir.

==Human history==

The island was a retreat for an early Christian saint, Baldred, &quot;the Apostle of the Lothians&quot;. Baldred is believed to have founded a monastery at Tyninghame. However, at times he retreated to the Bass Rock where he built a small hermitage.

===Settlement===
The earliest recorded proprietors are the Lauder of the Bass family, from whom Sir Harry Lauder is descended. According to legend, the island is said to have been a gift from King Malcolm III of Scotland. The crest on their heraldic arms is, appropriately, a gannet sitting upon a rock.

The 15th-century Scottish philosopher and historian Hector Boece gave the following description (original spelling):
The family had a castle on the island from an early date. Sir Robert de Lawedre is mentioned by Blind Harry in &quot;The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace&quot; as a compatriot of William Wallace, and Alexander Nisbet recorded his tombstone in 1718, in the floor of the old kirk in North Berwick: &quot;here lies Sir Robert de Lawedre, great laird of the Bass, who died May 1311&quot;. Five years later his son received that part of the island which until then had been retained by the Church because it contained the holy cell of Saint Baldred. A century later Wyntown&#x27;s &quot;Cronykil&quot; relates: &quot;In 1406 King Robert III, apprehensive of danger to his son James (afterwards James I) from the Duke of Albany, placed the youthful prince in the safe-custody of Sir Robert Lauder in his secure castle on the Bass prior to an embarkation for safer parts on the continent.&quot; Subsequently, says Tytler, &quot;Sir Robert Lauder of the Bass was one of the few people whom King James I admitted to his confidence.&quot; In 1424 Sir Robert Lauder of the Bass, with 18 men, had safe conduct with a host of other noblemen, as a hostage for James I at Durham. J. J. Reid also mentions that &quot;in 1424 when King James I returned from his long captivity in England, he at once consigned to the castle of the Bass, Walter Stewart, the eldest son of Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany, his cousin. The person who received the payments for the prisoner&#x27;s support was Sir Robert Lauder&quot;, whom Tytler further describes as &quot;a firm friend of the King&quot;. The second-last Lauder laird, George Lauder of the Bass died in his castle on the Bass in 1611.

In May 1497 King James IV visited the Bass and stayed in the castle with a later Sir Robert Lauder of the Bass (d.bef Feb 1508). The boatmen who conveyed the King from Dunbar were paid 14 shillings. George Lauder of the Bass entertained King James VI of Scotland when he visited the Bass in 1581; the king was so enamoured that he offered to buy the island, a proposition which did not commend itself to George Lauder. The King appears to have accepted the situation with good grace. George was a Privy Counsellor – described as the King&#x27;s &quot;familiar councillor&quot; – and tutor to the young Prince Henry.

In 1848 it was reported that there were &quot;about a score and a half&quot; of sheep grazing on the island. By 1870 it was claimed that &quot;twenty-five sheep could be grazed on the grassy top of the rock&quot;.

===Castle===
The Lauders built a fortification not far above the island&#x27;s only landing-place. The slope is crossed by a curtain wall, which naturally follows the lie of the ground, having projections and round bastions where a rocky projection offers a suitable foundation. The parapets are battlemented, with the usual walk along the top of the walls. Another curtain wall at right-angles runs down to the sea close to the landing-place, ending in a ruined round tower, whose vaulted base has poorly splayed and apparently rather unskilfully constructed embrasures. The entrance passes through this outwork wall close to where it joins the other.

The main defences are entered a little farther on in the same line, through a projecting two-story building which has some fireplaces with very simple and late mouldings. The buildings are of the local basalt, and the masonry is rough rubble; there are, as is so frequently the case, no very clear indications for dating the different parts, which were in all probability erected at different times.

A little beyond the entrance there was a tower that formed a simple keep/bastion and to which had been added a gabled chamber in the 17th century, which, though of restricted dimensions, must have been comfortable enough, with blue Dutch tiles round its moulded fireplace, later very much decayed. The keep and the living quarters within the walls were taken down to provide stone for the lighthouse in 1902.

A well at the top of the Bass, where today the foghorn is situated, provided freshwater for the island&#x27;s occupants.

===Chapel===
Halfway up the island stands the ruin of St Baldred&#x27;s Chapel, which is sited upon a cell or cave in which this Scottish Saint spent some time. Although the Lauders held most of the Bass Rock, this part of it had remained in the ownership of the Church until 1316, when it was granted to the family. The chapel appears to have been rebuilt by the Lauder family several times. A papal bull dated 6 May 1493, refers to the parish church of the Bass, or the Chapel of St Baldred, being &quot;noviter erecta&quot; (newly established) at that time. On 5 January 1542 John Lauder, son of Sir Robert Lauder of the Bass, was recorded as &quot;the Cardinal&#x27;s Secretary&quot; representing Cardinal David Beaton at a reconsecration of the restored and ancient St Baldred&#x27;s chapel on the Bass. In 1576 it was recorded that the church on the Bass, and that at Auldhame on the mainland, required no readers, doubtless something to do with the Reformation.

===Prison===
During the 15th century James I consigned several of his political enemies, including Walter Stewart, to the Bass. In this period, many members of the Clan MacKay ended up there, including Neil Bhass MacKay (Niall &quot;Bhas&quot; MacAoidh), who gained his epithet from being imprisoned there as a fourteen-year-old in 1428. He was kept there as a hostage after his father, Aonghas Dubh (Angus Dhu) of Strathnaver in Sutherland, was released, as security. According to one website


After almost 600 years, the Lauders lost the Bass in the 17th century during Cromwell&#x27;s invasion, and the castle subsequently (in 1671) became a notorious gaol to which for many decades religious and political prisoners, especially Covenanters were sent. The island has been called the Patmos of Scotland. Alexander Shields the Covenanting preacher, imprisoned on the island, later described the Bass as &quot;a dry and cold rock in the sea, where they had no fresh water nor any provision but what they had brought many miles from the country, and when they got it, it would not keep unspoiled&quot;. He is reported to have escaped by dressing in women&#x27;s clothing but this occurred from the Edinburgh Tolbooth rather than from the island&#x27;s gaol. 

James Fraser of Brea gave a fuller description including eating fruit from the island&#x27;s cherry trees. John Blackadder, and John Rae, died on the Bass and were buried at North Berwick. Blackadder had a Free Church named after him there.

James Anderson lists 39 Covenanting &quot;martyrs&quot; who were imprisoned on the Bass: Patrick Anderson, William Bell, Robert Bennet of Chesters, John Blackadder, Sir Hugh Campbell, Sir George Campbell, John Campbell, Robert Dick, John Dickson, James Drummond, Alexander Dunbar, James Fithie, Alexander Forrester, James Fraser, Robert Gillespie, Alexander Gordon, John Greig, Thomas Hog, Peter Kid, John Law, Joseph Learmont, William Lin, James Macaulay, John M&#x27;Gilligen, James Mitchell, Alexander Peden, Michael Potter, John Rae, Archibald Riddell, Robert Ross, Thomas Ross, Gilbert Rule, George Scot, Alexander Shields, William Spence, John Spreul (apothecary), John Spreul (town clerk), John Stewart, and Robert Traill.

Charles Maitland held the Bass for James VII for a brief period after the Scottish Convention declared him to be deposed.

However, some of the prisoners were there for many minor misdemeanors. In 1678 Hector Allan, a Quaker in Leith was sentenced to a period on the Rock for &quot;abusing and railing&quot; (i.e. verbally insulting) Rev Thomas Wilkie of North Leith Parish Church. Although this was then commuted to imprisonment in Leith Tolbooth, this seems a harsh punishment.

An extraordinary chapter in the Bass Rock&#x27;s history was its seizure by four Jacobites imprisoned in its castle, which they then held against government forces for nearly three years, 1691–1694. In 1688 the Catholic King James VII had been deposed by and replaced by William III of England and Mary II of England. During the ensuing years, supporters of exiled King James, known as ‘Jacobites’, fought unsuccessful wars of resistance in Scotland and Ireland, where Catholic allegiances were strongest. The Bass Rock&#x27;s castle was one of the last places in Scotland to be surrendered to William III&#x27;s new government, being handed over in 1690 by governor Charles Maitland. William III&#x27;s government then chose it as a prison for its Jacobite opponents. In 1691 four captured Catholic Jacobite officers were imprisoned there. On 18 June 1691, they managed to seize the Bass Rock&#x27;s castle while the much-depleted garrison was outside its walls for the difficult task of unloading a coal ship on the rocky landing stage. The garrison had no choice but to depart on the coal ship. When news spread on the nearby Scottish mainland, Jacobite supporters made covert boat trips to the Bass Rock with supplies and with men who wished to join the defenders. Word reached King James, exiled in France under the protection of Louis XIV, and ships from France brought supplies, including two large rowing boats from King James. The Jacobites used these boats to mount raids on the mainland for more supplies. They used the castle&#x27;s cannon to waylay some passing ships. William III&#x27;s government sent two large warships to bombard the castle but its position high above a sheer rock face made it impregnable. A naval blockade of the Bass Rock was then attempted instead which made access to fresh supplies increasingly difficult for the defenders. Their numbers had fallen since some were captured during raids on the mainland – there had been possibly 20 defenders at most. Furthermore, prospects for the Jacobite cause elsewhere in Britain had become hopeless. However, William III&#x27;s government was itself in despair at how to end the Bass Rock siege. In early 1694 the Bass Rock prisoners’ leader, Captain Michael Middleton, negotiated a visit by government representatives to discuss a solution. Middleton guessed that his adversaries lacked any means for estimating the number of defenders or their reserves of food, in view of the covert comings and goings to the island by ships from the mainland or from France. Accordingly, he stage-managed the visit to give a deceptive impression of strength on both counts. The ruse succeeded. On 18 April 1694 the Jacobite defenders accepted the very attractive surrender terms which they were offered – freedom, free transport to France if they wished, and release from prison for people who had been caught helping them from the mainland.
The fortress was abandoned by the government in 1701, and on 31 July 1706 the President of the Court of Session, Hew Dalrymple, Lord North Berwick, acquired the Bass by charter, ratified by an act of Parliament, the in March 1707), for a purely nominal sum, and the island has been ever since in the uninterrupted possession of the Dalrymple family.

Its inaccessibility became to mean something impossible with the saying:
==Fauna and flora==
===Animals===
The island plays host to more than 150,000 northern gannets and is the world&#x27;s largest colony of the species. Described famously by naturalists as &quot;one of the wildlife wonders of the world&quot; (often credited to David Attenborough), it was also awarded BBC Countryfile Magazine&#x27;s Nature Reserve of the Year, following a nomination by Chris Packham, in 2014/15. When viewed from the mainland, large regions of the surface appear white owing to the sheer number of birds (and their droppings, which give off 152,000 kg of ammonia per year, equivalent to the achievements of 10 million broilers). In fact the scientific name for the northern gannet, &quot;Morus bassanus&quot;, derives from the rock. It was known traditionally in Scots as a &quot;solan goose&quot;. As on other gannetries, such as St Kilda, the birds were harvested for their eggs and the flesh of their young chicks, which were considered delicacies. It is estimated that in 1850 almost 2,000 birds were harvested from the rock. Other bird species that frequent the rock include guillemot, razorbill, shag, puffin, eider and numerous gulls.

The natural history of the rock was written about almost five hundred years ago in John Mair&#x27;s &quot;De Gestis Scotorum&quot; (&quot;The deeds of the Scots&quot;), published in 1521. Today, the Scottish Seabird Centre at North Berwick has solar-powered cameras located on the island which beam back live close-up images of the seabirds to large screens on the mainland, just over a mile away. The images are sharp enough for visitors at the Seabird Centre to read the ID rings on birds&#x27; feet. The Seabird Centre has a range of cameras located on the islands of the Forth and also broadcasts the images live on the internet. The centre also has exclusive landing rights to the island from the owner Hew Hamilton-Dalrymple and operates a range of boat trips going around, and landing on, the island throughout the year, weather permitting.

In mid-June 2022 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was detected in the northern gannets connected to the Bass Rock, at that time the world&#x27;s largest colony. In 2022 more than 5,000 dead birds were counted on a single day, following a whole-island drone survey undertaken by the University of Edinburgh, in a colony that normally had 150,000 birds. Susan Davies, chief executive of the Scottish Seabird Centre, said, &quot;We know many more birds died before and after that. The scale of impact was heartbreaking to see.&quot;

===Plants===
The soil is fertile and supports a wide variety of plants. These include the Bass mallow which is otherwise only found on a few other islands, including Ailsa Craig and Steep Holm.

==Artistic influences==

Due to its imposing nature, prison and connection with Scottish history, the Bass has been featured in several fictional works.

===Robert Louis Stevenson===
Robert Louis Stevenson had at least one strong connection with the Bass, as his cousin, David Stevenson, designed the lighthouse there. Amongst his earliest memories were holidays in North Berwick. He often stayed at Scoughall Farm, whence the Bass can be seen, and local lore is credited as the inspiration for his short story &quot;The Wreckers&quot;.

&quot;Catriona&quot; is Stevenson&#x27;s 1893 sequel to &quot;Kidnapped&quot;. Both novels are set in the aftermath of the Jacobite risings, in the mid-18th century. The first part of &quot;Catriona&quot; recounts the attempts of the hero – David Balfour – to gain justice for James Stewart – James of the Glens – who has been arrested and charged with complicity in the Appin Murder. David makes a statement to a lawyer, and goes on to meet Lord Prestongrange – the Lord Advocate – to press the case for James&#x27; innocence. However his attempts fail as he is once again kidnapped and confined on the Bass Rock, until the trial is over, and James condemned to death.

The book begins with a dedication to Charles Baxter, a friend of Stevenson, written in his home in Western Samoa and says:

Chapter XIV is entitled simply &quot;The Bass&quot;, and gives a long description of the island, which is described as &quot;just the one crag of rock, as everybody knows, but great enough to carve a city from&quot;.
===Bruce Marshall===
Scottish writer Bruce Marshall used Bass Rock as the miraculous destination of the &quot;Garden of Eden&quot;, a dance hall of dubious reputation in his 1938 novel &quot;Father Malachy&#x27;s Miracle&quot;. The book was the basis for the German film &quot;Das Wunder des Malachias&quot; a 1961 black-and-white film directed by Bernhard Wicki and starring Horst Bollmann, although the film did not specify Bass Rock as the destination of the offending dance hall.

===Jane Lane===
Jane Lane’s 1950 &quot;Fortress in the Forth&quot; is a historical novel based on the actual 1691–1694 seizure of the Bass Rock castle by four Jacobite officers imprisoned there and their subsequent defence of the island against William III&#x27;s government for nearly three years. The final page summarises the differences between this fictional account and actual events: the names of the main characters have been changed to justify novelist inventions about their personalities, but otherwise the story largely follows the historical facts. The novel takes the form of invented letters and journal entries by different characters in order to tell the tale. A detailed diagram of the Bass Rock and its castle is supplied to show the locations of places mentioned.

===James Robertson===
The Bass Rock is a key location in &quot;The Fanatic&quot; by Scottish author James Robertson. The novel tells the story of a tourist guide in modern-day Edinburgh who becomes obsessed with two characters from Edinburgh&#x27;s past: Major Thomas Weir, a presbyterian who was eventually executed for incest, bestiality and witchcraft; and James Mitchell, a Covenanter who attempted to assassinate the Archbishop of St Andrews. Mitchell was tortured, imprisoned on the Bass Rock and eventually also executed.

===Music===
A pibroch was written by Iain Dall MacAoidh (MacKay), commemorating Neil Bhass&#x27; imprisonment and escape from the island, entitled &quot;The Unjust Incarceration&quot;.
It also featured as the cover photograph of the 1967 album &quot;Gateway To The Forth&quot; by Jimmy Shand &amp; his Band.

===Film===
The Bass Rock appears as background in the title song sequence of the 1998 Bollywood film &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot;.

<text>Psychological warfare (PSYWAR), or the basic aspects of modern psychological operations (PsyOp), has been known by many other names or terms, including Military Information Support Operations (MISO), Psy Ops, political warfare, &quot;Hearts and Minds&quot;, and propaganda. The term is used &quot;to denote any action which is practiced mainly by psychological methods with the aim of evoking a planned psychological reaction in other people&quot;.

Various techniques are used, and are aimed at influencing a target audience&#x27;s value system, belief system, emotions, motives, reasoning, or behavior. It is used to induce confessions or reinforce attitudes and behaviors favorable to the originator&#x27;s objectives, and are sometimes combined with black operations or false flag tactics. It is also used to destroy the morale of enemies through tactics that aim to depress troops&#x27; psychological states.

Target audiences can be governments, organizations, groups, and individuals, and is not just limited to soldiers. Civilians of foreign territories can also be targeted by technology and media so as to cause an effect on the government of their country.

Stories are said to be a key factor in a successful operation. Mass communication such as radio allows for direct communication with an enemy populace, and therefore has been used in many efforts. Social media channels and the internet allow for campaigns of disinformation and misinformation performed by agents anywhere in the world.

==History==

===Early===
Currying favor with supporters was the other side of psychological warfare, and an early practitioner of this was Alexander the Great, who successfully conquered large parts of Europe and the Middle East and held on to his territorial gains by co-opting local elites into the Greek administration and culture. Alexander left some of his men behind in each conquered city to introduce Greek culture and oppress dissident views. His soldiers were paid dowries to marry locals in an effort to encourage assimilation.

Genghis Khan, leader of the Mongol Empire in the 13th century AD employed less subtle techniques. Defeating the will of the enemy before having to attack and reaching a consented settlement was preferable to facing his wrath. The Mongol generals demanded submission to the Khan and threatened the initially captured villages with complete destruction if they refused to surrender. If they had to fight to take the settlement, the Mongol generals fulfilled their threats and massacred the survivors. Tales of the encroaching horde spread to the next villages and created an aura of insecurity that undermined the possibility of future resistance.

Genghis Khan also employed tactics that made his numbers seem greater than they actually were. During night operations he ordered each soldier to light three torches at dusk to give the illusion of an overwhelming army and deceive and intimidate enemy scouts. He also sometimes had objects tied to the tails of his horses, so that riding on open and dry fields raised a cloud of dust that gave the enemy the impression of great numbers. His soldiers used arrows specially notched to whistle as they flew through the air, creating a terrifying noise.

In the 6th century BCE Greek Bias of Priene successfully resisted the Lydian king Alyattes by fattening up a pair of mules and driving them out of the besieged city. When Alyattes&#x27; envoy was then sent to Priene, Bias had piles of sand covered with wheat to give the impression of plentiful resources.

During the Granada War, Spanish captain Hernán Pérez del Pulgar routinely employed psychological tactics as part of his guerrilla actions against the Emirate of Granada. In 1490, infiltrating the city by night with a small retinue of soldiers, he nailed a letter of challenge on the main mosque and set fire to the alcaicería before withdrawing.

In 1574, having been informed about the pirate attacks previous to the Battle of Manila, Spanish captain Juan de Salcedo had his relief force return to the city by night while playing marching music and carrying torches in loose formations, so they would appear to be a much larger army to any nearby enemy. They reached the city unopposed.

=== Modern Era ===
Because psyops shape public opinion and public memory, the rise of the printing press and mass communication greatly increased the use of psyops for military advantage. During the Indian Wars of the 17th through 19th centuries, politicians, newspaper reports and fictional novels about Native Americans all conveyed the belief that tribes in the Northeast had &quot;died out,&quot; and leaders of New England communities even gave speeches about the &quot;last Indians&quot; in New England, even as Native Americans continued to reside in these communities.

===World War I===

The start of modern psychological operations in war is generally dated to World War I. By that point, Western societies were increasingly educated and urbanized, and mass media was available in the form of large circulation newspapers and posters. It was also possible to transmit propaganda to the enemy via the use of airborne leaflets or through explosive delivery systems like modified artillery or mortar rounds.

At the start of the war, the belligerents, especially the British and Germans, began distributing propaganda, both domestically and on the Western front. The British had several advantages that allowed them to succeed in the battle for world opinion; they had one of the world&#x27;s most reputable news systems, with much experience in international and cross-cultural communication, and they controlled much of the undersea communications cable system then in operation. These capabilities were easily transitioned to the task of warfare.

The British also had a diplomatic service that maintained good relations with many nations around the world, in contrast to the reputation of the German services. While German attempts to foment revolution in parts of the British Empire, such as Ireland and India, were ineffective, extensive experience in the Middle East allowed the British to successfully induce the Arabs to revolt against the Ottoman Empire.

In August 1914, David Lloyd George appointed a Member of Parliament (MP), Charles Masterman, to head a Propaganda Agency at Wellington House. A distinguished body of literary talent was enlisted for the task, with its members including Arthur Conan Doyle, Ford Madox Ford, G. K. Chesterton, Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling and H. G. Wells. Over 1,160 pamphlets were published during the war and distributed to neutral countries, and eventually, to Germany. One of the first significant publications, the &quot;Report on Alleged German Outrages&quot; of 1915, had a great effect on general opinion across the world. The pamphlet documented atrocities, both actual and alleged, committed by the German army against Belgian civilians. A Dutch illustrator, Louis Raemaekers, provided the highly emotional drawings which appeared in the pamphlet.

In 1917, the bureau was subsumed into the new Department of Information and branched out into telegraph communications, radio, newspapers, magazines and the cinema. In 1918, Viscount Northcliffe was appointed Director of Propaganda in Enemy Countries. The department was split between propaganda against Germany organized by H.G Wells, and propaganda against the Austro-Hungarian Empire supervised by Wickham Steed and Robert William Seton-Watson; the attempts of the latter focused on the lack of ethnic cohesion in the Empire and stoked the grievances of minorities such as the Croats and Slovenes. It had a significant effect on the final collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Army at the Battle of Vittorio Veneto.

Aerial leaflets were dropped over German trenches containing postcards from prisoners of war detailing their humane conditions, surrender notices and general propaganda against the Kaiser and the German generals. By the end of the war, MI7b had distributed almost 26 million leaflets. The Germans began shooting the leaflet-dropping pilots, prompting the British to develop unmanned leaflet balloons that drifted across no-man&#x27;s land. At least one in seven of these leaflets were not handed in by the soldiers to their superiors, despite severe penalties for that offence. Even General Hindenburg admitted that &quot;Unsuspectingly, many thousands consumed the poison&quot;, and POWs admitted to being disillusioned by the propaganda leaflets that depicted the use of German troops as mere cannon fodder. In 1915, the British began airdropping a regular leaflet newspaper &quot;Le Courrier de l&#x27;Air&quot; for civilians in German-occupied France and Belgium.

At the start of the war, the French government took control of the media to suppress negative coverage. Only in 1916, with the establishment of the Maison de la Presse, did they begin to use similar tactics for the purpose of psychological warfare. One of its sections was the &quot;Service de la Propagande aérienne&quot; (Aerial Propaganda Service), headed by Professor Tonnelat and Jean-Jacques Waltz, an Alsatian artist code-named &quot;Hansi&quot;. The French tended to distribute leaflets of images only, although the full publication of US President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points, which had been heavily edited in the German newspapers, was distributed via airborne leaflets by the French.

The Central Powers were slow to use these techniques; however, at the start of the war the Germans succeeded in inducing the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire to declare &#x27;holy war&#x27;, or Jihad, against the Western infidels. They also attempted to foment rebellion against the British Empire in places as far afield as Ireland, Afghanistan, and India. The Germans&#x27; greatest success was in giving the Russian revolutionary, Lenin, free transit on a sealed train from Switzerland to Finland after the overthrow of the Tsar. This soon paid off when the Bolshevik Revolution took Russia out of the war.

===World War II===

Germany&#x27;s &quot;Fall Grün&quot; plan of invasion of Czechoslovakia had a large part dealing with psychological warfare aimed both at the Czechoslovak civilians and government as well as, crucially, at Czechoslovakia&#x27;s allies. It became successful to the point that Germany gained the acquiescence of the British and French governments to the German occupation of Czechoslovakia without having to fight an all-out war, sustaining only minimum losses in covert war before the Munich Agreement.
During World War II, the British made extensive use of deception – developing many new techniques and theories. The main protagonists at this time were &#x27;A&#x27; Force, set up in 1940 under Dudley Clarke, and the London Controlling Section, chartered in 1942 under the control of John Bevan. Clarke pioneered many of the strategies of military deception. His ideas for combining fictional orders of battle, visual deception and double agents helped define Allied deception strategy during the war, for which he has been referred to as &quot;the greatest British deceiver of WW2&quot;.

During the lead-up to the Allied invasion of Normandy, many new tactics in psychological warfare were devised. The plan for Operation Bodyguard set out a general strategy to mislead German high command as to the date and location of the invasion, which was obviously going to happen. Planning began in 1943 under the auspices of the London Controlling Section (LCS). A draft strategy, referred to as Plan Jael, was presented to Allied high command at the Tehran Conference. Operation Fortitude was intended to convince the Germans of a greater Allied military strength than was the case, through fictional field armies, faked operations to prepare the ground for invasion and &quot;leaked&quot; misinformation about the Allied order of battle and war plans.

Elaborate naval deceptions (Operations &quot;Glimmer&quot;, &quot;Taxable&quot; and &quot;Big Drum&quot;) were undertaken in the English Channel. Small ships and aircraft simulated invasion fleets lying off Pas de Calais, Cap d&#x27;Antifer and the western flank of the real invasion force. At the same time Operation Titanic involved the RAF dropping fake paratroopers to the east and west of the Normandy landings.
The deceptions were implemented with the use of double agents, radio traffic and visual deception. The British &quot;Double Cross&quot; anti-espionage operation had proven very successful from the outset of the war, and the LCS was able to use double agents to send back misleading information about Allied invasion plans. The use of visual deception, including mock tanks and other military hardware had been developed during the North Africa campaign. Mock hardware was created for &quot;Bodyguard&quot;; in particular, dummy landing craft were stockpiled to give the impression that the invasion would take place near Calais.

The Operation was a strategic success and the Normandy landings caught German defences unaware. Continuing deception, portraying the landings as a diversion from a forthcoming main invasion in the Calais region, led Hitler into delaying transferring forces from Calais to the real battleground for nearly seven weeks.

===Vietnam War===
The United States ran an extensive program of psychological warfare during the Vietnam War. The Phoenix Program had the dual aim of assassinating National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (NLF or Viet Cong) personnel and terrorizing any potential sympathizers or passive supporters. During the Phoenix Program, over 19,000 NLF supporters were killed. In Operation Wandering Soul, the United States also used tapes of distorted human sounds and played them during the night making the Vietnamese soldiers think that the dead were back for revenge.

The Vietcong and their forces also used a program of psychological warfare during this war. Trịnh Thị Ngọ, also known as Thu Hương and Hanoi Hannah, was a Vietnamese radio personality. She made English-language broadcasts for North Vietnam directed at United States troops. During the Vietnam War, Ngọ became famous among US soldiers for her propaganda broadcasts on Radio Hanoi. Her scripts were written by the North Vietnamese Army and were intended to frighten and shame the soldiers into leaving their posts. She made three broadcasts a day, reading a list of newly killed or imprisoned Americans, and playing popular US anti-war songs in an effort to incite feelings of nostalgia and homesickness, attempting to persuade US GIs that the US involvement in the Vietnam War was unjust and immoral. A typical broadcast began as follows:

How are you, GI Joe? It seems to me that most of you are poorly informed about the going of the war, to say nothing about a correct explanation of your presence over here. Nothing is more confused than to be ordered into a war to die or to be maimed for life without the faintest idea of what&#x27;s going on.

===21st century===
The CIA made extensive use of Contra soldiers to destabilize the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. The CIA used psychological warfare techniques against the Panamanians by delivering unlicensed TV broadcasts. The United States government has used propaganda broadcasts against the Cuban government through TV Marti, based in Miami, Florida. However, the Cuban government has been successful at jamming the signal of TV Marti.

In the Iraq War, the United States used the shock and awe campaign to psychologically maim and break the will of the Iraqi Army to fight.

In cyberspace, social media has enabled the use of disinformation on a wide scale. Analysts have found evidence of doctored or misleading photographs spread by social media in the Syrian Civil War and 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, possibly with state involvement. Military and governments have engaged in psychological operations (PSYOP) and informational warfare (IW) on social networking platforms to regulate foreign propaganda, which includes countries like the US, Russia, and China.

In 2022, Meta and the Stanford Internet Observatory found that over five years people associated with the U.S. military, who tried to conceal their identities, created fake accounts on social media systems including Balatarin, Facebook, Instagram, Odnoklassniki, Telegram, Twitter, VKontakte and YouTube in an influence operation in Central Asia and the Middle East. Their posts, primarily in Arabic, Farsi and Russian, criticized Iran, China and Russia and gave pro-Western narratives. Data suggested the activity was a series of covert campaigns rather than a single operation.

In operations in the South and East China Seas, both the United States and China have been engaged in &quot;cognitive warfare&quot;, which involves displays of force, staged photographs and sharing disinformation. The start of the public use of &quot;cognitive warfare&quot; as a clear movement occurred in 2013 with China&#x27;s political rhetoric.

==Examples of the term==
Most modern uses of the term &quot;psychological warfare&quot; refer to the following military methods:
* Demoralization:
** Distributing pamphlets that encourage desertion or supply instructions on how to surrender.
** Shock and awe military strategy.
** Projecting repetitive and disturbing noises and music for long periods at high volume towards groups under siege like during Operation Nifty Package.
* Propaganda radio stations, such as Lord Haw-Haw in World War II on the &quot;Germany calling&quot; station.
* False flag events.
* Terrorism
* The threat of Chemical weapons.
* Information warfare.

Daniel Lerner divides psychological warfare operations into three categories:
* White propaganda (omissions and emphasis): Truthful and not strongly biased, where the source of information is acknowledged.
* Grey propaganda (omissions, emphasis and racial/ethnic/religious bias): Largely truthful, containing no information that can be proven wrong; the source is not identified.
* Black propaganda (commissions of falsification): Inherently deceitful, information given in the product is attributed to a source that was not responsible for its creation.

Lerner says grey and black operations ultimately have a heavy cost, in that the target population sooner or later recognizes them as propaganda and discredits the source. He writes, &quot;This is one of the few dogmas advanced by Sykewarriors that is likely to endure as an axiom of propaganda: Credibility is a condition of persuasion. Before you can make a man do as you say, you must make him believe what you say.&quot; Consistent with this idea, the Allied strategy in World War II was predominantly one of truth (with certain exceptions).

In &quot;&quot;, Jacques Ellul discusses psychological warfare as a common peace policy practice between nations as a form of indirect aggression. This type of propaganda drains the public opinion of an opposing regime by stripping away its power on public opinion. This form of aggression is hard to defend against because no international court of justice is capable of protecting against psychological aggression since it cannot be legally adjudicated. &quot;Here the propagandists is [sic] dealing with a foreign adversary whose morale he seeks to destroy by psychological means so that the opponent begins to doubt the validity of his beliefs and actions.&quot;

=== Terrorism ===
According to Boaz Ganor, terrorism weakens the sense of security and disturbs daily life, damaging the target country&#x27;s capability to function. Terrorism is a strategy that aims to influence public opinion into pressuring leaders to give in to the terrorists&#x27; demands, and the population becomes a tool to advance the political agenda.

==By country==

===China===

According to U.S. military analysts, attacking the enemy&#x27;s mind is an important element of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s military strategy. This type of warfare is rooted in the Chinese Stratagems outlined by Sun Tzu in &quot;The Art of War&quot; and &quot;Thirty-Six Stratagems&quot;. In its dealings with its rivals, China is expected to utilize Marxism to mobilize communist loyalists, as well as flex its economic and military muscle to persuade other nations to act in the Chinese government&#x27;s interests. The Chinese government also tries to control the media to keep a tight hold on propaganda efforts for its people. The Chinese government also utilizes cognitive warfare against Taiwan.

===France===
The Centre interarmées des actions sur l&#x27;environnement is an organization made up of 300 soldiers whose mission is to assure to the four service arm of the French Armed Forces psychological warfare capacities. Deployed in particular to Mali and Afghanistan, its missions &quot;consist in better explaining and accepting the action of French forces in operation with local actors and thus gaining their trust: direct aid to the populations, management of reconstruction sites, actions of communication of influence with the population, elites and local elected officials&quot;. The center has capacities for analysis, influence, expertise and instruction.

===Germany===
In the German , the Zentrum Operative Kommunikation is responsible for PSYOP efforts. The center is subordinate to the Cyber and Information Domain Service branch alongside multiple IT and Electronic Warfare battalions and consists of around 1000 soldiers. One project of the German PSYOP forces is the radio station &quot;Stimme der Freiheit&quot; (Sada-e Azadi, Voice of Freedom), heard by thousands of Afghans. Another is the publication of various newspapers and magazines in Kosovo and Afghanistan, where German soldiers serve with NATO.

===Iran===
The Iranian government had an operation program to use the 2022 FIFA World Cup as a psyop against concurrent people&#x27;s protests.

=== Israel ===
The Israeli government and its military make use of psychological warfare. In 2021, Israeli newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot; revealed that &quot;Abu Ali Express&quot;, a popular news page on Telegram and Twitter purportedly dedicated to &quot;Arab affairs&quot;, was actually run by a Jewish Israeli paid consultant to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The IDF&#x27;s psyops account had been the source of a number of noteworthy reports that were afterwards cited by the Israeli and international media.

===Russia===
=== Soviet Union ===

===United Kingdom===
The British were one of the first major military powers to use psychological warfare in the First and Second World Wars. In the current British Armed Forces, PsyOps are handled by the tri-service 15 Psychological Operations Group. (See also MI5 and Secret Intelligence Service). The Psychological Operations Group comprises over 150 personnel, approximately 75 from the regular Armed Services and 75 from the Reserves. The Group supports deployed commanders in the provision of psychological operations in operational and tactical environments.

The Group was established immediately after the 1991 Gulf War, has since grown significantly in size to meet operational requirements, and since 2015 has been one of the sub-units of the 77th Brigade, formerly called the Security Assistance Group.

In June 2015, NSA files published by Glenn Greenwald revealed details of the JTRIG group at British intelligence agency GCHQ covertly manipulating online communities. This is in line with JTRIG&#x27;s goal: to &quot;destroy, deny, degrade [and] disrupt&quot; enemies by &quot;discrediting&quot; them, planting misinformation and shutting down their communications.

In March 2019, it emerged that the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) of the UK&#x27;s Ministry of Defence (MoD) is tendering to arms companies and universities for £70M worth of assistance under a project to develop new methods of psychological warfare. The project is known as the human and social sciences research capability (HSSRC).

===United States===

The term psychological warfare is believed to have migrated from Germany to the United States in 1941. During World War II, the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff defined psychological warfare broadly, stating &quot;Psychological warfare employs &quot;any&quot; weapon to influence the mind of the enemy. The weapons are psychological only in the effect they produce and not because of the weapons themselves.&quot; The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines psychological warfare as:
&quot;The planned use of propaganda and other psychological actions having the primary purpose of influencing the opinions, emotions, attitudes, and behavior of hostile foreign groups in such a way as to support the achievement of national objectives.&quot;

This definition indicates that a critical element of the U.S. psychological operations capabilities includes propaganda and by extension counterpropaganda. Joint Publication 3–53 establishes specific policy to use public affairs mediums to counter propaganda from foreign origins.

The purpose of United States psychological operations is to induce or reinforce attitudes and behaviors favorable to US objectives. The Special Activities Center (SAC) is a division of the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s Directorate of Operations, responsible for Covert Action and &quot;Special Activities&quot;. These special activities include covert political influence (which includes psychological operations) and paramilitary operations. SAC&#x27;s political influence group is the only US unit allowed to conduct these operations covertly and is considered the primary unit in this area.

A U.S. Army field manual released in January 2013 states that &quot;Inform and Influence Activities&quot; are critical for describing, directing, and leading military operations. Several Army Division leadership staff are assigned to “planning, integration and synchronization of designated information-related capabilities.&quot;

Journalist and fiction writer P.W. Singer, author of &quot;Wired for War,&quot; teaches military leaders about how to incorporate &quot;useful fiction&quot; stories and narrative structure into military psyops.

In September 2022, the DoD launched an audit of covert information warfare after social media companies identified a suspected U.S. military operation.

<doc id="144620" wikidata="Q3048813" url="?curid=144620" title="Edwin Scrymgeour">
<text>Edwin Scrymgeour (28 July 1866 – 1 February 1947) was a British politician who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Dundee in Scotland. He is the only person ever elected to the House of Commons on a prohibitionist ticket, as the candidate of the Scottish Prohibition Party. He was affectionately known as Neddy Scrymgeour.

==Life==

A native of Dundee, he was educated at West End Academy. He was a pioneer of the Scottish temperance movement and established his party in 1901 to further that aim.

In 1896 he is listed as a clerk, living at 42 Kings Road in Dundee.

He served on Dundee City Council and began contesting elections in the 1908 Dundee by-election, which saw Winston Churchill first elected for Dundee, and Scrymgeour continued to fight at every election thereafter and increased his vote. That was in part because of his popularity, generally left-wing sympathies and history with the labour movement. Churchill&#x27;s stance against suffragettes may have had an impact in a city that had many women as breadwinners and many men as &quot;kettle-boilers&quot; (househusbands).

In 1910 he was living at 92 Victoria Road in Dundee.

In the 1922 election, Scrymgeour and the Labour candidate, E. D. Morel, jointly ousted Winston Churchill, who had represented the city as a Liberal (to then a Coalition Liberal). Scrymgeour remained an MP for Dundee until the 1931 general election, when he was ousted by Florence Horsbrugh.

Out of Parliament, Scrymgeour worked as an evangelical Chaplain at East House and Maryfield Hospital in Dundee. Scrymgeour was a leader of the unsuccessful opposition to disbanding the Scottish Prohibition Party in 1935. 

He died at his home in Dundee on 1 February 1947, followed by his wife Margaret on 28 May. Both were interred alongside Scrymgeour&#x27;s father James in Dundee&#x27;s Eastern Cemetery.

Coxhill was born to George Compton Coxhill and Mabel Margaret Coxhill (née Motton) at Portsmouth, Hampshire, UK. He grew up in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, and bought his first saxophone in 1947. After national service he became a busy semi-professional musician, touring US airbases with Denzil Bailey&#x27;s Afro-Cubists and the Graham Fleming Combo. In the 1960s he played with visiting American blues, soul and jazz musicians including Rufus Thomas, Mose Allison, Otis Spann, and Champion Jack Dupree. He also developed his practice of playing unaccompanied solo saxophone, often busking in informal performance situations. Other than his solo playing, he performed mostly as a sideman or as an equal collaborator, rather than a conventional leader – there was no regular Lol Coxhill Trio or Quartet as would normally be expected of a saxophonist. Instead he had many intermittent but long-lasting collaborations with like-minded musicians.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he was a member of Canterbury scene bands Carol Grimes and Delivery and then Kevin Ayers and the Whole World.

He became known for his solo playing and for work in duets with pianist Steve Miller and guitarist G. F. Fitzgerald.

He was thought to have largely inspired Joni Mitchell&#x27;s song &quot;For Free&quot;, while busking solo on the old footbridge which formed part of the Hungerford Bridge between Waterloo and Charing Cross.

Coxhill collaborated with other musicians including Mike Oldfield, Morgan Fisher (of Mott the Hoople), Chris McGregor&#x27;s Brotherhood of Breath and its musical descendant The Dedication Orchestra, Django Bates, the Damned, Hugh Metcalfe, Derek Bailey, Fred Frith and performance art group Welfare State.

He lived for a while in the Digswell Arts Trust in Welwyn Garden City and was a much liked member of the commune.

He often worked in small collaborative groups with semi-humorous names such as the Johnny Rondo Duo or Trio (with pianist Dave Holland – not the bassist of the same name), the Melody Four (characteristically a trio, with Tony Coe and Steve Beresford), and The Recedents (with guitarist Mike Cooper and percussionist Roger Turner), known as such because the members were (in Coxhill&#x27;s words) &quot;all bald&quot;, though the name may additionally be a play on the American band the Residents. Typically these bands performed a mix of free improvisation interspersed with ballroom dance tunes and popular songs. There was humour throughout his music but he sometimes felt it necessary to tell audiences that the free playing was not intended as a joke.

Coxhill was compere and occasional performer at the Bracknell Jazz Festival, and a raconteur as well as a musician; he often would introduce his music by saying the words, &quot;what I am about to play you may not understand&quot;. It was following a performance at Bracknell that he recorded the melodramatic monologue &quot;Murder in the Air&quot;.

His son Simon is a punk drummer who played with Acme Sewage Co. his daughter Claire is a vocalist and his daughter Maddie sings and plays in a ukulele band. All three children appear with their father on &quot;I am the Walrus&quot;, one of the tracks on &quot;Ear of Beholder&quot; and later featured on &quot;The Exotic Beatles part 2&quot;.

On 26 July 2007, Coxhill married Ulrike Gertrud Scholz. They had been together since 1991.

<doc id="144625" wikidata="Q1046656" url="?curid=144625" title="Graphics Device Interface">
<text>The Graphics Device Interface (GDI) is a legacy component of Microsoft Windows responsible for representing graphical objects and transmitting them to output devices such as monitors and printers. It was superseded by DirectDraw API and later Direct2D API. Windows apps use Windows API to interact with GDI, for such tasks as drawing lines and curves, rendering fonts, and handling palettes. The Windows USER subsystem uses GDI to render such UI elements as window frames and menus. Other systems have components that are similar to GDI; for example: Mac OS had QuickDraw, and Linux and Unix have X Window System core protocol.

GDI&#x27;s most significant advantages over more direct methods of accessing the hardware are perhaps its scaling capabilities and its abstract representation of target devices. Using GDI, it is possible to draw on multiple devices, such as a screen and a printer, and expect proper reproduction in each case. This capability is at the center of most &quot;What You See Is What You Get&quot; applications for Microsoft Windows.

Simple games that do not require fast graphics rendering may use GDI. However, GDI is relatively hard to use for advanced animation, lacks a notion for synchronizing with individual video frames in the video card, and lacks hardware rasterization for 3D. Modern games usually use DirectX, Vulkan, or OpenGL instead.

==Technical details==
In GDI, a &quot;device context&quot; (DC) defines the attributes of text and images for the output device, e.g., screen or printer. GDI maintains the actual context. Generating the output requires a &quot;handle to the device context&quot; (HDC). After generating the output, the handle could be released.

GDI uses Bresenham&#x27;s line drawing algorithm to draw aliased lines.

==Version history==

===Early versions===
GDI was present in the initial release of Windows. MS-DOS programs had manipulated the graphics hardware using software interrupts (sometimes via the Video BIOS) and by manipulating video memory directly. Code written in this way expects that it is the only user of the video memory, which was not tenable on multi-tasked environment, such as Windows. The &quot;BYTE&quot; magazine, in December 1983, discussed Microsoft&#x27;s plans for a system to output graphics to both printers and monitors with the same code in the forthcoming first release of Windows.

On Windows 3.1x and Windows 9x, GDI can use Bit blit features for 2D acceleration, if suitable graphics card driver is installed.

===Windows XP===
With the introduction of Windows XP, GDI+ complemented GDI. GDI+ has been written in C++. It adds anti-aliased 2D graphics, floating point coordinates, gradient shading, more complex path management, intrinsic support for modern graphics-file formats like JPEG and PNG, and support for composition of affine transformations in the 2D view pipeline. GDI+ uses RGBA values to represent color. Use of these features is apparent in Windows XP components, such as Microsoft Paint, Windows Picture and Fax Viewer, Photo Printing Wizard, and the My Pictures Slideshow screensaver. Their presence in the basic graphics layer greatly simplifies implementations of vector-graphics systems such as Adobe Flash or SVG. Besides, .NET Framework provides a managed interface for GDI+ via the codice_1 namespace.

While GDI+ is included with Windows XP and later, the GDI+ dynamic library can also be shipped with an application and used on older versions of Windows.

Because of the additional text processing and resolution independence capabilities in GDI+, the CPU undertakes text rendering. The result is an order of magnitude slower than the hardware-accelerated GDI. Chris Jackson published some tests indicating that a piece of text rendering code he had written could render 99,000 glyphs per second in GDI, but the same code using GDI+ rendered 16,600 glyphs per second.

GDI+ is similar (in purpose and structure) to Apple″s &quot;QuickDraw GX&quot; subsystem, and the open-source &quot;libart&quot; and Cairo libraries.

===Windows Vista===
In Windows Vista, all Windows applications including GDI and GDI+ applications run in the new compositing engine, Desktop Window Manager (DWM), which is hardware-accelerated. As such, the GDI itself is no longer hardware-accelerated. Because of the nature of the composition operations, window moves can be faster or more responsive because underlying content does not need to be re-rendered by the application.

===Windows 7===
Windows 7 includes GDI hardware acceleration for blitting operations in the Windows Display Driver Model v1.1. This improves GDI performance and allows DWM to use local video memory for compositing, thereby reducing system memory footprint and increasing the performance of graphics operations. Most primitive GDI operations are still not hardware-accelerated, unlike Direct2D. GDI+ continues to rely on software rendering in Windows 7.

== GDI printers ==
A GDI printer or Winprinter (analogous to a Winmodem) is a printer designed to accept output from a host computer running Windows. The host computer does all print processing: GDI renders a page as a bitmap, which the printer driver receives, processes, and sends to the associated printer. The combination of GDI and the driver is bidirectional; they receive information from the printer such as whether it is ready to print or is out of paper.

Printers that do not rely on GDI require hardware, firmware, and memory for page rendering while a GDI printer uses the host computer for this. However, a printer with its own control language can accept input from any device with a suitable driver, while a GDI printer requires a PC running Windows. GDI printers can be made available to computers on a network if they are connected as shared printers on a computer which is on and running Windows. Some &quot;generic&quot; GDI drivers such as codice_2 have been written; they aim to make GDI printers compatible with non-Windows operating systems such as FreeBSD, but they cannot support all printers.

In order to allow simpler creation of drivers for Winprinters, the Microsoft Universal Printer Driver was created. This allows printer vendors to write Generic Printer Description (GPD) &quot;minidrivers&quot;, which describe the printer&#x27;s capabilities and command set in plaintext, rather than having to do kernel mode driver development.

Microsoft has moved away from this printing model with Open XML Paper Specification.

== Limitations ==
Each window consumes GDI objects. As the complexity of the window increases, with additional features such as buttons and images, its GDI object usage also increases. When too many objects are in use, Windows is unable to draw any more GDI objects, leading to misbehaving software and frozen and unresponsive program operation. Many applications are also incorrectly coded and fail to release GDI objects after use, which further adds to the problem. The total available GDI objects varies from one version of Windows to the next: Windows 9x had a limit of 1,200 total objects; Windows 2000 has a limit of 16,384 objects; and Windows XP and later have a configurable limit (via the registry) that defaults to 10,000 objects per process (but a theoretical maximum of 65,536 for the entire session). Windows 8 and later increase the GDI object limit to 65,536 per user login session.

Earlier versions of Windows such as Windows 3.1 and Windows 98 included a Resource Meter program to allow the user to monitor how much of the total system GDI resources were in use. This resource meter consumed GDI objects itself. Later versions such as Windows 2000 and Windows XP can report GDI object usage for each program in the Task Manager, but they cannot tell the user the total GDI capacity available.

Overflowing GDI capacity can affect Windows itself, preventing new windows from opening, menus from displaying, and alert boxes from appearing. The situation can be difficult to clear and can potentially require a forced reset of the system, since it prevents core system programs from functioning. In Windows 8 and 8.1, a forced log-off occurs as a result of GDI capacity overflow, instead of a reboot.

== Successor ==
Direct2D is the successor of GDI and GDI+. Its sibling, DirectWrite, replaces Uniscribe. They were shipped with Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, and were available for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 (with Platform Update installed). Later, Microsoft developed Win2D, a free and open-source GDI-like class library. Win2D&#x27;s target audience are developers that use C++, C#, and Visual Basic.NET to develop Universal Windows Platform apps.

<doc id="144626" wikidata="Q1055735" url="?curid=144626" title="Swiss Guards">
<text>Swiss Guards ( ; ; ) are Swiss soldiers who have served as guards at foreign European courts since the late 15th century.

The earliest Swiss Guard unit to be established on a permanent basis was the Hundred Swiss (&quot;Cent-Suisses&quot;), which served at the French court from 1490 to 1817. This small force was complemented in 1616 by a Swiss Guards regiment. In the 18th and early 19th centuries several other Swiss Guard units existed for periods in various European courts.

Foreign military service was outlawed by the first Swiss Federal Constitution of 1848 and a federal Law of 1859, with the only exception being the Pontifical Swiss Guard (; ) stationed in Vatican City. The modern Papal Swiss Guard serves as both a ceremonial unit and a bodyguard. Established in 1506, it is one of the oldest military units in the world. It is also the smallest army in the world.

==In France==

Two different units of Swiss mercenaries performed guard duties for the Kings of France: the Hundred Swiss (&quot;Cent Suisses&quot;) served in the Palace essentially as bodyguards and ceremonial troops, and the Swiss Guards (&quot;Gardes Suisses&quot;), who guarded entrances and outer perimeter. In addition, the Gardes Suisses served in the field as a fighting regiment in times of war.

===Hundred Swiss (&quot;Cent Suisses&quot;)===
The Hundred Swiss were created in 1480 when Louis XI retained a Swiss company for his personal guard.

By 1496 they comprised one hundred guardsmen and about twenty-seven officers and sergeants. Their main role was to protect the King in the palace as the &quot;garde du dedans du Louvre&quot; (the Louvre indoor guard), but in the earlier part of their history they also accompanied the King to war. In the Battle of Pavia (1525) the Hundred Swiss of Francis I were slain before Francis was captured by the Spanish. The Hundred Swiss shared indoor guard duties with the King&#x27;s Bodyguards (&quot;Garde du Corps&quot;), who were French.

The Hundred Swiss were armed with halberds, the blade of which carried the Royal arms in gold, as well as gold-hilted swords. Their ceremonial dress until 1789 comprised an elaborate 16th century Swiss costume covered with braid and livery lace. A surviving example is on display in the &quot;Musée de l&#x27;Armée&quot; in Paris. A less ornate dark blue and red uniform with bearskin headdress was worn for ordinary duties.

The &quot;Cent Suisses&quot; company was disbanded after Louis XVI left the Palace of Versailles in October 1789. It was, however, refounded on 15 July 1814 with an establishment of 136 guardsmen and eight officers. The Hundred Swiss accompanied Louis XVIII into exile in Belgium the following year and returned with him to Paris following the Battle of Waterloo. The unit then resumed its traditional role as palace guards at the Tuileries, but in 1817 it was replaced by a new guard company drawn from the French regiments of the Royal Guard.

===Swiss Guards (&quot;Gardes Suisses&quot;)===
In 1616, Louis XIII gave an existing regiment of Swiss infantry the name of &quot;Gardes suisses&quot; (Swiss Guards). The new regiment primarily protected the doors, gates and outer perimeters of the royal palaces.

By the end of the 17th century the Swiss Guards were formally part of the &quot;Maison militaire du roi&quot;. As such, they were brigaded with the &quot;Gardes françaises&quot; (French Guards Regiment), with whom they shared the outer guard, and were in peacetime stationed in barracks on the outskirts of Paris. Like the eleven Swiss regiments of line infantry in French service, the &quot;Gardes suisses&quot; wore red coats. The line regiments had black, yellow or light blue facings but the Swiss Guards were distinguished by dark blue lapels and cuffs edged in white embroidery. Only the grenadier company wore bearskins, while the other companies wore the standard tricorn headdress of the French infantry.

During the 17th and 18th centuries the Swiss Guards maintained a reputation for discipline and steadiness in both peacetime service and foreign campaigning. Their officers were all Swiss and their rate of pay was substantially higher than that of the regular French soldiers.

The Guards were recruited from all Swiss cantons. The nominal establishment was 1,600 men though actual numbers seem to have normally been below this. Disciplinary matters were the responsibility of Swiss officers within the regiment, under a code of punishments that was significantly harsher than that of the remainder of the French army.

===During the Revolution===
The most famous episode in the history of the Swiss Guards was their defence of the Tuileries Palace in central Paris during the French Revolution. Of the nine hundred Swiss Guards defending the palace on 10 August 1792, about six hundred were killed during the fighting or massacred after they surrendered. One group of sixty Swiss were taken as prisoners to the Paris City Hall before being killed by the crowd there. An estimated one hundred and sixty more died in prison of their wounds, or were killed during the September Massacres that followed. Apart from less than a hundred Swiss who escaped from the Tuileries, some hidden by sympathetic Parisians, the only survivors of the regiment were a three-hundred-strong detachment that had been sent to Normandy to escort grain convoys a few days before 10 August. The Swiss officers were mostly massacred, although Major Karl Josef von Bachmann, in command at the Tuileries, was formally tried and guillotined in September, still wearing his red uniform coat. Two Swiss officers, the captains Henri de Salis and Joseph Zimmermann, did however survive and went on to reach senior rank under Napoleon and the Restoration.

There appears to be no truth in the charge that Louis XVI caused the defeat and destruction of the Guards by ordering them to lay down their arms when they could still have held the Tuileries. Rather, the Swiss ran low on ammunition and were overwhelmed by superior numbers when fighting broke out spontaneously after the royal family were escorted from the palace to take refuge with the National Assembly. A note written by the King has survived that ordered the Swiss to retreat from the palace and return to their barracks, but they only did so after their position became untenable. The regimental standards were secretly buried by the adjutant shortly before the regiment was summoned to the Tuileries on the night of 8/9 August, indicating that he foresaw the likely end. They were discovered by a gardener and ceremoniously burned by the new Republican authorities on 14 August. The barracks of the Guard at Courbevoie were stormed by the local National Guard and the few Swiss still on duty there also killed.

The heroic but futile stand of the Swiss is commemorated by Bertel Thorvaldsen&#x27;s &quot;Lion Monument&quot; in Lucerne, dedicated in 1821, which shows a dying lion collapsed upon broken symbols of the French monarchy. An inscription on the monument lists the twenty-six Swiss officers who died on 10 August and 2–3 September 1792, and records that approximately 760 Swiss Guardsmen were killed on those days.
===Following the Restoration===
The French Revolution abolished mercenary troops in its citizen army, but Napoleon and the Bourbon Restoration both made use of Swiss troops. Four Swiss infantry regiments served with Napoleon in both Spain and Russia. Two of the eight infantry regiments included in the &quot;garde royale&quot; from 1815 to 1830 were Swiss and can be regarded as successors to the &quot;Gardes suisses&quot;. When the Tuileries was stormed again in the July Revolution (29 July 1830), the Swiss regiments, fearful of another massacre, withdrew or melted into the crowd. They were not used again. In 1831 disbanded veterans of the Swiss regiments and another foreign unit, the Hohenlohe Regiment, were recruited into the newly raised French Foreign Legion for service in Algeria.

==Swiss in other armies==
Swiss Guard units similar to those of France were in existence at several other Royal Courts and public entities at the dates indicated below:
*From 1579 on, a Swiss Guard served the House of Savoy, rulers of Savoy and later the Kingdom of Sardinia. The Guard was dissolved in 1798.
*From 1696 to 1713, a Swiss Guard served at the court of Frederick I of Prussia.
*A &quot;Cent-Suisse&quot; unit was in existence from 1656 to 1680, from 1725 until 1757 and again from 1763 to 1814 in the Kingdom of Saxony.
*From 1672 until 1796, a company of Swiss (&quot;Cent-Suisses&quot;) served as a personal guard for the Stadhouder of the Dutch Republic; besides a Dutch Guards Regiment. There was also a Swiss Guards Regiment from 1749 to 1796.
*The aristocratic Republic of Genoa had a Swiss Guard in service from 1609 to 1797 for its Doge&#x27;s Palace and city gates.
*A Swiss Guard established in 1581 for the Duke of Lorraine, served Duke Francis-Stephen, indemnified with the Grand Duchy of Tuscany in 1737, in Florence and, crowned emperor of the Holy Roman Empire in 1745, in Austria. It was dismissed 1767 in Vienna.
*The Swiss Guard to the Electoral Palatinate by Rhine was several times disbanded and reformed between 1582 and 1778.
*The Gate, Palace and Treasury (&quot;Ufficio dell&#x27;Abbondanza&quot;, Italian for &quot;office for abundance&quot;) of the City Republic of Lucca were protected by a Swiss Guard from 1663 to 1804.
*Khedive Mohamed Tewfik Pasha hired an irregular Swiss Guard in 1882 for the constabulary of Alexandria; it was dismissed the next year.
*From more than a half-dozen Swiss Life Guard units employed at various dates to protect the Pope and individual Papal legates, only the Papal Swiss Guard has survived until the present day, under a special accord with the Swiss Government.

In total, Swiss mercenary regiments have been employed as guard and regular line troops in seventeen different armies; notably those of France, Spain and Naples (see Swiss mercenaries).

==Swiss constitutional prohibition==
The first Swiss constitution, as amended in 1848, forbade all military capitulations, a federal law, as amended 30 September 1859, all military capitulations and recruitment of Swiss by foreign powers, although volunteering of individuals in foreign armies continued until prohibited outright in 1927. The Papal Swiss Guard, reflecting the particular status of the Holy See and the Vatican City State and the character of the unit as a bodyguard, remains an exception to this prohibition, explicitly defined between the parties.

==In popular culture==
When writing &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Shakespeare assumed (perhaps relying on his sources) that the royal house of Denmark employed a Swiss Guard: In Act IV, Scene v (line 98) he has King Claudius exclaim &quot;Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door&quot;. However, it may also be due to the word &quot;Swiss&quot; having become a generic term for a royal guard in popular European usage. Coincidentally, the present-day gatekeepers of the royal palace of Copenhagen are known as &quot;schweizere&quot;, &quot;Swiss&quot;.

<text>A counterculture is a culture whose values and norms of behavior differ substantially from those of mainstream society, sometimes diametrically opposed to mainstream cultural mores. A countercultural movement expresses the ethos and aspirations of a specific population during a well-defined era. When oppositional forces reach critical mass, countercultures can trigger dramatic cultural changes. Countercultures differ from subcultures.

Prominent examples of countercultures in the Western world include the Levellers (1645–1650), Bohemianism (1850–1910), the more fragmentary counterculture of the Beat Generation (1944–1964), and the globalized counterculture of the 1960s which in the United States consisted primarily of Hippies and Flower Children (ca. 1965–1975, peaking in 1967). Regarding this last group, when referring to themselves, counterculture will usually be capitalized and is often hyphenated as: Counter-Culture or Counter-culture.

==Definition and characteristics==
John Milton Yinger originated the term &quot;contraculture&quot; in his 1960 article in &quot;American Sociological Review&quot;. Yinger suggested the use of the term contraculture &quot;wherever the normative system of a group contains, as a primary element, a theme of conflict with the values of the total society, where personality variables are directly involved in the development and maintenance of the group&#x27;s values, and wherever its norms can be understood only by reference to the relationships of the group to a surrounding dominant culture.&quot;

Some scholars have attributed the &quot;counterculture&quot; to Theodore Roszak, author of &quot;The Making of a Counter Culture&quot;. It became prominent in the news media amid the social revolution that swept the Americas, Western Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand during the 1960s.

Scholars differ in the characteristics and specificity they attribute to &quot;counterculture&quot;. &quot;Mainstream&quot; culture is of course also difficult to define, and in some ways becomes identified and understood through contrast with counterculture. Counterculture might oppose mass culture (or &quot;media culture&quot;), or middle-class culture and values. Counterculture is sometimes conceptualized in terms of generational conflict and rejection of older or adult values.

Counterculture may or may not be explicitly political. It typically involves criticism or rejection of currently powerful institutions, with accompanying hope for a better life or a new society. It does not look favorably on party politics or authoritarianism.

Cultural development can also be affected by way of counterculture. Scholars such as Joanne Martin and Caren Siehl, deem counterculture and cultural development as &quot;a balancing act, [that] some core values of a counterculture should present a direct challenge to the core values of a dominant culture&quot;. Therefore, a prevalent culture and a counterculture should coexist in an uneasy symbiosis, holding opposite positions on valuable issues that are essentially important to each of them. According to this theory, a counterculture can contribute a plethora of useful functions for the prevalent culture, such as &quot;articulating the foundations between appropriate and inappropriate behavior and providing a safe haven for the development of innovative ideas&quot;.

During the late 1960s, hippies became the largest and most visible countercultural group in the United States.
According to Sheila Whiteley, &quot;recent developments in sociological theory complicate and problematize theories developed in the 1960s, with digital technology, for example, providing an impetus for new understandings of counterculture&quot;. Andy Bennett writes that &quot;despite the theoretical arguments that can be raised against the sociological value of counterculture as a meaningful term for categorising social action, like subculture, the term lives on as a concept in social and cultural theory… [to] become part of a received, mediated memory&quot;. However, &quot;this involved not simply the utopian but also the dystopian and that while festivals such as those held at Monterey and Woodstock might appear to embrace the former, the deaths of such iconic figures as Brian Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison and Janis Joplin, the nihilistic mayhem at Altamont, and the shadowy figure of Charles Manson cast a darker light on its underlying agenda, one that reminds us that &#x27;pathological issues [are] still very much at large in today&#x27;s world&quot;.

== Literature ==
The counterculture of the 1960s and early 1970s generated its own unique brand of notable literature, including comics and cartoons, and sometimes referred to as the underground press. In the United States, this includes the work of Robert Crumb and Gilbert Shelton, and includes Mr. Natural; Keep on Truckin&#x27;; &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;; Fat Freddy&#x27;s Cat; Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers; the album cover art for &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot;; and in several countries contributions to &quot;International Times&quot;, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, and &quot;Oz&quot; magazine. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, these comics and magazines were available for purchase in head shops along with items like beads, incense, cigarette papers, tie-dye clothing, Day-Glo posters, books, etc.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, some of these shops selling hippie items also became cafés where hippies could hang out, chat, smoke cannabis, read books, etc., e.g. Gandalf&#x27;s Garden in the King&#x27;s Road, London, which also published a magazine of the same name. Another such hippie/anarchist bookshop was Mushroom Books, tucked away in the Lace Market area of Nottingham.

== Media ==

Some genres tend to challenge societies with their content that is meant to outright question the norms within cultures and even create change usually towards a more modern way of thought. More often than not, sources of these controversies can be found in art such as Marcel Duchamp whose piece &quot;Fountain&quot; was meant to be &quot;a calculated attack on the most basic conventions of art&quot; in 1917. Contentious artists like Banksy base most of their works off of mainstream media and culture to bring pieces that usually shock viewers into thinking about their piece in more detail and the themes behind them. A great example can be found in Dismaland, the biggest project of &quot;anarchism&quot; to be organised and exhibited which showcases multiple works such as an &quot;iconic Disney princess&#x27;s horse-drawn pumpkin carriage, [appearing] to re-enact the death of Princess Diana&quot;.

=== Music ===
Counterculture is very much evident in music particularly on the basis of the separation of genres into those considered acceptable and within the status quo and those not. Since many minority groups are already considered countercultural, the music they create and produce may reflect their sociopolitical realities and their musical culture may be adopted as a social expression of their counterculture. This is reflected in dancehall with the concept of base frequencies and base culture in Julian Henriques&#x27;s &quot;Sonic diaspora&quot;, where he expounds that &quot;base denotes crude, debased, unrefined, vulgar, and even animal&quot; for the Jamaican middle class and is associated with the &quot;bottom-end, low frequencies…basic lower frequencies and embodied resonances distinctly inferior to the higher notes&quot; that appear in dancehall.
According to Henriques, &quot;base culture is bottom-up popular, street culture, generated by an urban underclass surviving almost entirely outside the formal economy&quot;. That the music is low frequency sonically and regarded as reflective of a lower culture shows the influential connection between counterculture and the music produced. Although music may be considered base and counter culture, it may actually enjoy a lot of popularity which can be seen by the labelling of hip hop as a counterculture genre, despite it being one of the most commercially successful and high charting genres.

=== Assimilation ===
Many of these artists though once being taboo, have been assimilated into culture and are no longer a source of moral panic since they do not cross overtly controversial topics or challenge staples of current culture. Instead of being a topic to fear, they have initiated subtle trends that other artists and sources of media may follow.

== Digital counterculture ==

=== Definition and theory ===
Digital countercultures are online communities, and patterns of tech usage, that significantly deviate from mainstream culture. To understand the elements that shape digital countercultures, its best to start with Lingel&#x27;s classifications of mainstream approaches to digital discourse: &quot;[T]hat online activity relates to (dis)embodiment, that the Internet is a platform for authenticity and experimentation, and that web-based interactions are placeless.&quot;

==== Disembodiment ====
The basis for online disembodiment is that, contrary to the corporeal nature of offline interactions, a user&#x27;s physical being does not have any relevance to their online interactions. However, for users whose physical existence is marginalized or shaped by counterculture (ex: gender identities outside the binary, ethnic minorities, punk culture/fashion), their lived experiences build a subjectivity that carries over into their online interactions. As put by Shaka McGlotten: &quot;[T]he fluidity and playfulness of cyberspace and the intimacies it was supposed to afford have been punctuated by corporeality.&quot;

==== Authenticity and experimentation ====
Arguments that the Internet is a platform for authenticity and experimentation highlight its role in the creation or enhancement of identities. This approach asserts that norms of non-virtual social life restrict users&#x27; ability to express themselves fully in person, but online interactions eliminate these barriers and allow them to identify in new ways. One means by which this exploration takes place is online &quot;identity tourism,&quot; which allows users to appropriate an identity without any of the offline, corporeal risks associated with that identity. A critique of this form of experimentation is that it gives the &quot;tourist&quot; a false impression that they understand the experiences and history of that identity, even if their Internet interactions are superficial. Moreover, it is especially harmful when used as a means to deceptively masquerade oneself to appeal to digital counterculture communities. However, especially for countercultures that are marginalized or demonized, experimentation can allow users to embrace an identity that they align with, but hide offline out of fear, and engage with that culture.

==== Placelessness ====
The final approach is on online communication as placeless, asserting that the consequences of geographic distance are rendered null and void by the Internet. Lingel argues that this approach is technologically determinist in its assumption that the placelessness provided by access to technology can single-handedly remedy structural inequality. Moreover, Mark Graham states that the persistence of spatial metaphors in describing the Internet&#x27;s societal impact creates &quot;a dualistic offline/online worldview [that] can depoliticize and mask the very real and uneven power relationships between different groups of people.&quot; Subscribing to this perceived depoliticization prevents an understanding of digital countercultures. Socio-cultural, power hierarchies on the Internet shape the mainstream, and without these mainstreams as a point of comparison, there are no grounds to define digital counterculture.

=== Examples ===
Marginalized communities often struggle to meet their needs on mainstream media. Jessa Lingel, an associate professor at the Annenberg School for Communication, had conducted field research on examples of digital counterculture as part of her studies. In her book &quot;Digital Countercultures and the Struggle for Community&quot;, she focused on the Brooklyn Drag community and their battle for a Queerer Facebook to meet their specific needs of social media utilization. In the drag culture, there are many holiday and festivals such as Halloween, New Year&#x27;s Eve, and Bushwig that they celebrate over a vibrant queer nightlife. While utilizing social media platforms such as Facebook to post and record their cultural events, the drag community has noticed the large schism between its &quot;queerer and more countercultural community of drag queens&quot; and Facebook&#x27;s claimed global community. This gap is further realized through Facebook&#x27;s change in the policy from &quot;real-name&quot; to &quot;authentic-name&quot; in 2015 when hundreds of drag queens&#x27; accounts were frozen and shut down because they had not registered with their legal names. Communities with &quot;queerer culture&quot; culture and &quot;marginalized needs&quot; continue to struggle to fulfill their social media needs while balancing their counterculture identity in today&#x27;s social media landscape where the internet is largely monopolized by several big technology firms.

== LGBT ==

Gay liberation (considered a of various modern LGBT social movements) was known for its links to the counterculture of the time (e.g. groups like the Radical Faeries), and for the gay liberationists&#x27; intent to transform or abolish fundamental institutions of society such as gender and the nuclear family; in general, the politics were radical, anti-racist, and anti-capitalist in nature. In order to achieve such liberation, consciousness raising and direct action were employed.

At the outset of the 20th century, homosexual acts were punishable offenses in these countries. The prevailing public attitude was that homosexuality was a moral failing that should be punished, as exemplified by Oscar Wilde&#x27;s 1895 trial and imprisonment for &quot;gross indecency&quot;. But even then, there were dissenting views. Sigmund Freud publicly expressed his opinion that homosexuality was &quot;assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation; it cannot be classified as an illness; we consider it to be a variation of the sexual function, produced by a certain arrest of sexual development&quot;. According to Charles Kaiser&#x27;s &quot;The Gay Metropolis&quot;, there were already semi-public gay-themed gatherings by the mid-1930s in the United States (such as the annual drag balls held during the Harlem Renaissance). There were also bars and bathhouses that catered to gay clientele and adopted warning procedures (similar to those used by Prohibition-era speakeasies) to warn customers of police raids. But homosexuality was typically subsumed into bohemian culture, and was not a significant movement in itself.

Eventually, a genuine gay culture began to take root, albeit very discreetly, with its own styles, attitudes and behaviors and industries began catering to this growing demographic group. For example, publishing houses cranked out pulp novels like &quot;The Velvet Underground&quot; that were targeted directly at gay people. By the early 1960s, openly gay political organizations such as the Mattachine Society were formally protesting abusive treatment toward gay people, challenging the entrenched idea that homosexuality was an aberrant condition, and calling for the decriminalization of homosexuality. Despite very limited sympathy, American society began at least to acknowledge the existence of a sizable population of gays.

Disco music in large part rose out of the New York gay club scene of the early 1970s as a reaction to the stigmatization of gays and other outside groups such as blacks by the counterculture of that era. By later in the decade, disco was dominating the pop charts. The popular Village People and the critically acclaimed Sylvester had gay-themed lyrics and presentation.

Another element of LGBT counter-culture that began in the 1970s—and continues today—is the lesbian land, landdyke movement, or womyn&#x27;s land movement. Radical feminists inspired by the back-to-the-land initiative and migrated to rural areas to create communities that were often female-only and/or lesbian communes. &quot;Free Spaces&quot; are defined by Sociologist Francesca Polletta as &quot;small-scale settings within a community or movement that are removed from the direct control of dominant groups, are voluntarily participated in, and generate the cultural challenge that precedes or accompanies political mobilization. Women came together in Free Spaces like music festivals, activist groups and collectives to share ideas with like-minded people and to explore the idea of the lesbian land movement. The movement is closely tied to eco-feminism.

The four tenets of the Landdyke Movement are relationship with the land, liberation and transformation, living the politics, and bodily Freedoms. Most importantly, members of these communities seek to live outside of a patriarchal society that puts emphasis on &quot;beauty ideals that discipline the female body, compulsive heterosexuality, competitiveness with other women, and dependence&quot;. Instead of adhering typical female gender roles, the women of Landdyke communities value &quot;self-sufficiency, bodily strength, autonomy from men and patriarchal systems, and the development of lesbian-centered community&quot;. Members of the Landdyke movement enjoy bodily freedoms that have been deemed unacceptable in the modern Western world—such as the freedom to expose their breasts, or to go without any clothing at all. An awareness of their impact on the Earth, and connection to nature is essential members of the Landdyke Movement&#x27;s way of life.

The watershed event in the American gay rights movement was the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City. Following this event, gays and lesbians began to adopt the militant protest tactics used by anti-war and black power radicals to confront anti-gay ideology. Another major turning point was the 1973 decision by the American Psychiatric Association to remove homosexuality from the official list of mental disorders. Although gay radicals used pressure to force the decision, Kaiser notes that this had been an issue of some debate for many years in the psychiatric community, and that one of the chief obstacles to normalizing homosexuality was that therapists were profiting from offering dubious, unproven &quot;cures&quot;.

The AIDS epidemic was initially an unexpected blow to the movement, especially in North America. There was speculation that the disease would permanently drive gay life underground. Ironically, the tables were turned. Many of the early victims of the disease had been openly gay only within the confines of insular &quot;gay ghettos&quot; such as New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village and San Francisco&#x27;s Castro; they remained closeted in their professional lives and to their families. Many heterosexuals who thought they did not know any gay people were confronted by friends and loved ones dying of &quot;the gay plague&quot; (which soon began to infect heterosexual people also). LGBT communities were increasingly seen not only as victims of a disease, but as victims of ostracism and hatred. Most importantly, the disease became a rallying point for a previously complacent gay community. AIDS invigorated the community politically to fight not only for a medical response to the disease, but also for wider acceptance of homosexuality in mainstream America.

During the early 1980s what was dubbed &quot;New Music&quot;, New wave, &quot;New pop&quot; popularized by MTV and associated with gender bending Second British Music Invasion stars such as Boy George and Annie Lennox became what was described by Newsweek at the time as an alternate mainstream to the traditional masculine/heterosexual rock music in the United States.

In 2003, the United States Supreme Court officially declared all sodomy laws unconstitutional in &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;.

== History ==
Bill Osgerby argues that:
the counterculture&#x27;s various strands developed from earlier artistic and political movements. On both sides of the Atlantic the 1950s &quot;Beat Generation&quot; had fused existentialist philosophy with jazz, poetry, literature, Eastern mysticism, and drugs—themes that were all sustained in the 1960s counterculture.

=== United States ===


In the United States, the counterculture of the 1960s became identified with the rejection of conventional social norms of the 1950s. Counterculture youth rejected the cultural standards of their parents, especially with respect to racial segregation and initial widespread support for the Vietnam War, and, less directly, the Cold War—with many young people fearing that America&#x27;s nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union, coupled with its involvement in Vietnam, would lead to a nuclear holocaust.

In the United States, widespread tensions developed in the 1960s in American society that tended to flow along generational lines regarding the Vietnam War, race relations, sexual mores, women&#x27;s rights, traditional modes of authority, and a materialist interpretation of the American Dream. White, middle class youth—who made up the bulk of the counterculture in Western countries—had sufficient leisure time, thanks to widespread economic prosperity, to turn their attention to social issues. These social issues included support for civil rights, women&#x27;s rights, and LGBT rights movements, and opposition to the Vietnam War. The counterculture also had access to a media which was eager to present their concerns to a wider public. Demonstrations for social justice created far-reaching changes affecting many aspects of society. Hippies became the largest countercultural group in the United States.

Rejection of mainstream culture was best embodied in the new genres of psychedelic rock music, pop art, and new explorations in spirituality. Musicians who exemplified this era in the United Kingdom and United States included The Beatles, John Lennon,  Neil Young, Bob Dylan, The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, Frank Zappa, The Rolling Stones, Velvet Underground, Janis Joplin, The Who, Joni Mitchell, The Kinks, Sly and the Family Stone and, in their early years, Chicago. New forms of musical presentation also played a key role in spreading the counterculture, with large outdoor rock festivals being the most noteworthy. The climactic live statement on this occurred from August 15–18, 1969, with the &quot;Woodstock Music Festival&quot; held in Bethel, New York—with 32 of rock&#x27;s and psychedelic rock&#x27;s most popular acts performing live outdoors during the sometimes rainy weekend to an audience of half a million people. (Michael Lang stated 400,000 attended, half of which did not have a ticket.) It is widely regarded as a pivotal moment in popular music history—with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; calling it one of the &quot;50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock and Roll&quot;. According to Bill Mankin, &quot;It seems fitting… that one of the most enduring labels for the entire generation of that era was derived from a rock festival: the &#x27;Woodstock Generation&#x27;.&quot;

Songs, movies, TV shows, and other entertainment media with socially-conscious themes—some allegorical, some literal—became very numerous and popular in the 1960s. Counterculture-specific sentiments expressed in song lyrics and popular sayings of the period included things such as &quot;do your own thing&quot;, &quot;turn on, tune in, drop out&quot;, &quot;whatever turns you on&quot;, &quot;eight miles high&quot;, &quot;sex, drugs, and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;, and &quot;light my fire&quot;. Spiritually, the counterculture included interest in astrology, the term &quot;Age of Aquarius&quot; and knowing people&#x27;s astrological signs of the Zodiac. This led Theodore Roszak to state &quot;A eclectic taste for mystic, occult, and magical phenomena has been a marked characteristic of our post-war youth culture since the days of the beatniks.&quot; In the United States, even actor Charlton Heston contributed to the movement, with the statement &quot;Don&#x27;t trust anyone over thirty&quot; (a saying coined in 1965 by activist Jack Weinberg) in the 1968 film &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;; the same year, actress and social activist Jane Fonda starred in the sexually-themed &quot;Barbarella&quot;. Both actors opposed the Vietnam War during its duration, and Fonda would eventually become controversially active in the peace movement.

The counterculture in the United States has been interpreted as lasting roughly from 1964 to 1972—coincident with America&#x27;s involvement in Vietnam—and reached its peak in August 1969 at the Woodstock Festival, New York, characterized in part by the film &quot;Easy Rider&quot; (1969). Unconventional or psychedelic dress; political activism; public protests; campus uprisings; pacifist then loud, defiant music; recreational drugs; communitarian experiments, and sexual liberation were hallmarks of the sixties counterculture—most of whose members were young, White, and middle class.
In the United States, the movement divided the population. To some Americans, these attributes reflected American ideals of free speech, social equality, world peace, and the pursuit of happiness; to others, they reflected a self-indulgent, pointlessly rebellious, unpatriotic, and destructive assault on the country&#x27;s traditional moral order. Authorities banned the psychedelic drug LSD, restricted political gatherings, and tried to enforce bans on what they considered obscenity in books, music, theater, and other media.

The counterculture has been argued to have diminished in the early 1970s, and some have attributed two reasons for this. First, it has been suggested that the most popular of its political goals—civil rights, civil liberties, gender equality, environmentalism, and the end of the Vietnam War—were &quot;accomplished&quot; (to at least some degree); and also that its most popular social attributes—particularly a &quot;&quot; mentality in personal lifestyles (including, but not limited to the &quot;sexual revolution&quot;)—were co-opted by mainstream society. Second, a decline of idealism and hedonism occurred as many notable counterculture figures died, the rest settled into mainstream society and started their own families, and the &quot;magic economy&quot; of the 1960s gave way to the stagflation of the 1970s—the latter costing many in the middle-classes the luxury of being able to live outside conventional social institutions. The counterculture, however, continues to influence social movements, art, music, and society in general, and the post-1973 mainstream society has been in many ways a hybrid of the 1960s establishment and counterculture.

The counterculture movement has been said to be rejuvenated in a way that maintains some similarities from the Counterculture of the 1960s, but it is different as well. Photographer Steve Schapiro investigated and documented these contemporary hippie communities from 2012 to 2014. He traveled the country with his son, attending festival after festival. These findings were compiled in Schapiro&#x27;s book &quot;Bliss: Transformational Festivals &amp; the Neo Hippie.&quot; One of his most valued findings was that these &quot;Neo Hippies&quot; experience and encourage such a spiritual commitment to the community.

===Australia===

Australia&#x27;s countercultural trend followed the one burgeoning in the US, and to a lesser extent than the one in Great Britain. Political scandals in the country, such as the disappearance of Harold Holt, and the 1975 constitutional crisis, as well as Australia&#x27;s involvement in Vietnam War, led to a disillusionment or disengagement with political figures and the government. Large protests were held in the country&#x27;s most populated cities such as Sydney and Melbourne, one prominent march was held in Sydney in 1971 on George Street. The photographer Roger Scott, who captured the protest in front of the Queen Victoria Building, remarked: &quot;I knew I could make a point with my camera. It was exciting. The old conservative world was ending and a new Australia was beginning. The demonstration was almost silent. The atmosphere was electric. The protesters were committed to making their presence felt … It was clear they wanted to show the government that they were mighty unhappy&quot;.

Political upheaval made its way into art in the country: film, music and literature were shaped by the ongoing changes both within the country, the Southern Hemisphere and the rest of the world. Bands such as The Master&#x27;s Apprentices, The Pink Finks and Normie Rowe &amp; The Playboys, along with Sydney&#x27;s The Easybeats, Billy Thorpe &amp; The Aztecs and The Missing Links began to emerge in the 1960s.

One of Australia&#x27;s most noted literary voices of the counter-culture movement was Frank Moorhouse, whose collection of short stories, &quot;Futility and Other Animals&quot;, was first published in Sydney 1969. Its &quot;discontinuous narrative&quot; was said to reflect the &quot;ambience of the counter-culture&quot;. Helen Garner&#x27;s &quot;Monkey Grip&quot; (1977), released eight years later, is considered a classic example of the contemporary Australian novel, and captured the thriving countercultural movement in Melbourne&#x27;s inner-city in the mid 1970s, specifically open relationships and recreational drug use. Years later, Garner revealed it was strongly autobiographical and based on her own diaries. Additionally, from the 1960s, surf culture took rise in Australia given the abundance of beaches in the country, and this was reflected in art, from bands such as The Atlantics and novels like &quot;Puberty Blues&quot; as well as the film of the same name.

===Great Britain===
Starting in the late 1960s the counterculture movement spread quickly and pervasively from the US. Britain did not experience the intense social turmoil produced in America by the Vietnam War and racial tensions. Nevertheless, British youth readily identified with their American counterparts&#x27; desire to cast off the older generation&#x27;s social mores. The new music was a powerful weapon. Rock music, which had first been introduced from the US in the 1950s, became a key instrument in the social uprisings of the young generation and Britain soon became a groundswell of musical talent thanks to groups like the Beatles, Rolling Stones, the Who, Pink Floyd, and more in coming years.

The antiwar movement in Britain closely collaborated with their American counterparts, supporting peasant insurgents in the Asian jungles. The &quot;Ban the Bomb&quot; protests centered around opposition to nuclear weaponry; the campaign gave birth to what was to become the peace symbol of the 1960s.

=== Soviet Union ===
Although not exactly equivalent to the English definition, the term Контркультура (&quot;Kontrkul&#x27;tura&quot;) became common in Soviet Union (Russian, Ukrainian underground and other) to define a 1990s cultural movement that promoted acting outside of cultural conventions: the use of explicit language; graphical descriptions of sex, violence and illicit activities; and uncopyrighted use of &quot;safe&quot; characters involved in such activities.

During the early 1970s, the Soviet government rigidly promoted optimism in Russian culture. Divorce and alcohol abuse were viewed as taboo by the media. However, Russian society grew weary of the gap between real life and the creative world, and underground culture became &quot;forbidden fruit&quot;. General satisfaction with the quality of existing works led to parody, such as how the Russian anecdotal joke tradition turned the setting of &quot;War and Peace&quot; by Leo Tolstoy into a grotesque world of sexual excess. Another well-known example is black humor (mostly in the form of short poems) that dealt exclusively with funny deaths and/or other mishaps of small, innocent children.

In the mid-1980s, the Glasnost policy permitted the production of less optimistic works. As a consequence, Soviet (and Russian) cinema during the late 1980s and the early 1990s manifested in action movies with explicit (but not necessarily graphic) scenes of ruthless violence and social dramas about drug abuse, prostitution and failing relationships. Although Russian movies of the time would be rated &quot;R&quot; in the United States due to violence, the use of explicit language was much milder than in American cinema.

In the late 1990s, Soviet counterculture became increasingly popular on the Internet. Several websites appeared that posted user-created short stories dealing with sex, drugs and violence. The following features are considered the most popular topics in such works:

* Wide use of explicit language;
* Deliberate misspelling;
* Descriptions of drug use and consequences of abuse;
* Negative portrayals of alcohol use;
* Sex and violence: nothing is a taboo – in general, violence is rarely advocated, while all types of sex are considered good;
* Parody: media advertising, classic movies, pop culture and children&#x27;s books are considered fair game;
* Non-conformance; and
* Politically incorrect topics, mostly racism, xenophobia and homophobia.

A notable aspect of counterculture at the time was the influence of contra-cultural developments on Russian pop culture. In addition to traditional Russian styles of music, such as songs with jail-related lyrics, new music styles with explicit language were developed.

=== Asia ===

Sebastian Kappen, an Indian theologian, has tried to redefine counterculture in the Asian context. In March 1990, at a seminar in Bangalore, he presented his countercultural perspectives (chapter 4 in S. Kappen, &quot;Tradition, modernity, counterculture: an Asian perspective&quot;, Visthar, Bangalore, 1994). Kappen envisages counterculture as a new culture that has to negate the two opposing cultural phenomena in Asian countries:
#invasion by Western capitalist culture, and
#the emergence of revivalist movements.
Kappen writes, &quot;Were we to succumb to the first, we should be losing our identity; if to the second, ours would be a false, obsolete identity in a mental universe of dead symbols and delayed myths&quot;.

The most important countercultural movement in India had taken place in the state of West Bengal during the 1960s by a group of poets and artists who called themselves Hungryalists.

<text>Free music or libre music is music that, like free software, can freely be copied, distributed and modified for any purpose. Thus free music is either in the public domain or licensed under a free license by the artist or copyright holder themselves, often as a method of promotion. It does &quot;not&quot; mean that there should be no fee involved. The word free refers to freedom (as in free software), not to price.

The Free Music Philosophy generally encourages creators to free music using whatever language or methods they wish. A Free Music Public License (FMPL) is available for those who prefer a formal approach.
Some free music is licensed under licenses that are intended for software (like the GPL) or other writings (the GFDL). But there are also licenses especially for music and other works of art, such as Free To Use&#x27;s Free To Use License, EFF&#x27;s Open Audio License, LinuxTag&#x27;s Open Music License, the Free Art license and some of the Creative Commons Licences.

==History==
Before the advent of copyright law in the early 18th century and its subsequent application to music compositions first, all music was &quot;free&quot; according to the definitions used in free software or free music, since there were no copyright restrictions. In practice however, music reproduction was generally restricted to live performances and the legalities of playing other people&#x27;s music was unclear in most jurisdictions. Copyright laws changed this gradually so much so that in the late 20th century, copying a few words of a musical composition or a few seconds of a sound recording, the two forms of music copyright, could be considered criminal infringement.

In response, the concept of free music was codified in the Free Music Philosophy by Ram Samudrala in early 1994. It was based on the idea of &quot;Free Software&quot; by Richard Stallman and coincided with nascent open art and open information movements. Up to this point, few modern musicians distributed their recordings and compositions in an unrestricted manner, and there was no concrete rationale as to why they did it, or should do it. 

The Free Music Philosophy used a three pronged approach to voluntarily encourage the spread of unrestricted copying, based on the fact that copies of recordings and compositions could be made and distributed with complete accuracy and ease via the Internet. First, since music by its very nature is organic in its growth, the ethical basis of limiting its distribution using copyright laws was questioned. That is, an existential responsibility was fomented upon music creators who were drawing upon the creations of countless others in an unrestricted manner to create their own. Second, it was observed that the basis of copyright law, &quot;to promote the progress of science and useful arts&quot;, had been perverted by the music industry to maximise profit over creativity resulting in a huge burden on society (the control of copying) simply to ensure its profits. Third, as copying became rampant, it was argued that musicians would have no choice but to move to a different economic model that exploited the spread of information to make a living, instead of trying to control it with limited government enforced monopolies.

The Free Music Philosophy was reported on by diverse media outlets including &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, &quot;Levi&#x27;s Original Music Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Free Radical&quot;, &quot;Wired&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Along with free software and Linux (a free operating system), copyleft licenses, the explosion of the Web and rise of P2P, the cementing of mp3 as a compression standard for recordings, and despite the efforts of the music industry, free music became largely the reality in the early 21st century. Organisations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Creative Commons with free information champions like Lawrence Lessig were devising numerous licenses that offered different flavours of copyright and copyleft. The question was no longer why and how music should be free, but rather how creativity would flourish while musicians developed models to generate revenue in the Internet era.

<doc id="144637" wikidata="Q1271874" url="?curid=144637" title="After the Thin Man">
<text>After the Thin Man is a 1936 American murder mystery comedy film directed by W. S. Van Dyke and starring William Powell, Myrna Loy and James Stewart. A sequel to the 1934 feature &quot;The Thin Man&quot;, the film presents Powell and Loy as Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s characters Nick and Nora Charles. The film also features Elissa Landi, Joseph Calleia, Jessie Ralph, Alan Marshal and Penny Singleton (billed under her maiden name as Dorothy McNulty).

==Plot==
Nick and Nora Charles return from vacation on New Year&#x27;s Eve to their home in San Francisco, where Nora&#x27;s stuffy family expects the couple to join them for a formal dinner. Nick is disliked by Nora&#x27;s aunt Katherine, the family matriarch, as his immigrant heritage and experience as a &quot;flatfoot&quot; are considered beneath Nora&#x27;s station. Nora&#x27;s cousin Selma tells Nora that her husband Robert has been missing for three days. David Graham is Selma&#x27;s earlier fiancé and an old friend of Nora&#x27;s family. He offers to pay Robert $25,000 to leave and grant Selma a divorce. Nora successfully badgers Nick into helping to locate Robert.
Robert is at the LiChi Club, a Chinese nightclub, where he has been in an affair with Polly, the club&#x27;s star performer. Unknown to Robert, Polly and club owner Dancer plan to steal the money that David will pay Robert. Polly&#x27;s brother Phil Byrnes wants money from her, but Dancer throws him out, just as Nick and Nora arrive looking for Robert.

They tell Robert about David&#x27;s offer and he agrees to it. After being paid off, Robert goes back into Aunt Katherine&#x27;s home to retrieve some clothes and say goodbye to Selma, who begs him not to leave. Nick sees Dancer and nightclub co-owner Lum Kee each leave the club separately at the same time. Robert leaves at the stroke of midnight and is shot dead in the foggy street. David finds Selma standing over Robert, a pistol in her hand. Lt. Abrams considers Selma the prime suspect, and her fragile mental state only strengthens his belief. Selma insists that she never fired her gun, but her claim cannot be backed up as David had thrown the gun into San Francisco Bay, thinking she was guilty. Nick begins to investigate to find the actual murderer.

Someone throws a rock with a note tied to it through Nick and Nora&#x27;s window. The note accuses Polly and Dancer of conspiring to kill Robert while revealing that Phil Byrnes is an ex-con and Polly&#x27;s husband. Lt. Abrams has found several checks from Robert to Polly, including one for $20,000, but Nick carefully compares them and sees that all but one are forgeries.

Nick and Lt. Abrams find Phil murdered in his hotel room. Nick investigates Polly&#x27;s apartment and discovers that someone using the name Anderson had bugged it from the apartment above. While in the upper apartment, Nick hears Dancer enter Polly&#x27;s home. Nick pursues Dancer into the basement, but Dancer fires a round of bullets at Nick and disappears. Nick discovers the body of the building custodian, Pedro. Nora identifies Pedro as the former gardener from her father&#x27;s estate. She finds a photo in Pedro&#x27;s room of him with their other servants. Lt. Abrams says someone tried to call Nick from the building just before Pedro was killed.

Nick has Lt. Abrams gather all the suspects in the Anderson apartment. Dancer and Polly confess that they had intended to use a forged check to steal Robert&#x27;s money but claim that they are innocent of murder. David says that he has not seen Pedro in six years but remembers his long white mustache. But Nick notices that in the picture from six years ago that Nora had found, Pedro had a small, dark mustache, and Nick infers that David saw Pedro recently.

Nick now reconstructs the murder. David is revealed to be Anderson. He hated Robert for taking Selma from him, and also secretly hated Selma for leaving him. He rented the apartment so that he could eavesdrop on Polly and Robert and kill them in the apartment. Instead, he killed Robert on the street and tried to frame Selma for the murder. While spying on Polly, he overheard Phil&#x27;s real identity and Phil&#x27;s plan to blackmail David. David murdered Phil and threw the message rock as a diversion.

However, Pedro had recognized David as the mysterious Anderson, so David killed him as well. David brandishes a pistol and threatens to kill Selma and then himself. Lum Kee flings his hat in David&#x27;s face, allowing Nick and Lt. Abrams to overpower him. This surprises Nora because Nick had Lum Kee&#x27;s brother sent to prison for bank robbery, but Lum Kee explains: &quot;I don&#x27;t like my brother. I like his girl. You my friend.&quot;

Nick and Nora leave San Francisco by train for the East Coast, accompanied by Selma. Later, alone with Nora, Nick notices that she is knitting a baby&#x27;s sock and suddenly realizes that she is pregnant. Nora gently chides him, saying, &quot;And you call yourself a detective.&quot;
