<text>Manchester is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Kitsap County, Washington, United States. The population was 5,714 at the 2020 census. Manchester is located on the Puget Sound approximately 10 miles from downtown Seattle, and is adjacent to county seat Port Orchard to its east. Today, Manchester labels itself as a village. It is small in size but is home to a Kitsap Regional Library (KRL) branch, a post office, an elementary school, and a beachfront park to serve its residents.

==History==

Manchester was established in the 1860s and was originally known as &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, after the borough in New York City. The name was changed to &quot;Manchester&quot; in 1892 in honor of the city of Manchester, England. Manchester was accessible by land via Shelton/Allyn/Belfair, but the main population center in the region, Seattle, had only boat access. After a permanent dock was built in 1908, regular steamboat service connected Manchester to nearby communities like Colby, Southworth, and Harper, and to Seattle across the water.

From 1925 to 1936, a ferry route across Puget Sound connected Manchester with Alki Point in West Seattle. When the Alki Point dock washed away in 1936, the Seattle terminus was shifted to Colman Dock on the Seattle central waterfront. Ferry service was discontinued in 1949 and has never resumed.

In its early years, Manchester was used as a military installation. As early as 1889, land in present-day Manchester was used by the U.S War Department as part of a Puget Sound defense system After World War I, the U.S. Navy acquired the property, and in 1940 built a pier in nearby Clam Bay for refueling ships. The Manchester Fuel Depot, currently the military&#x27;s largest single fuel station in the U.S, saw heavy use during World War II and still operates today. While the Navy still owns most of the original land, some of the property is now occupied by Manchester State Park as well as by Environmental Protection Agency and NOAA labs.

In 1953, the library in Manchester was slated for destruction. The town pulled together and a new library was constructed in 1954. Today, Manchester has excellent views of Seattle, Mount Rainier, and Puget Sound, has a public boat launch, a boat parade on the opening day of boating season, and sponsors salmon bakes at the Manchester library.

==History==

Navy Yard City was established in 1909 and resisted several attempts at annexation from the City of Bremerton, which now surrounds the unincorporated community.

In late 1932, the West Side Improvement Club was established in the community, using the motto &quot;A BIGGER AND BETTER NEIGHBORHOOD&quot;. The club first sought out to improve the local roads and utilities, with a particular focus on connecting more homes to water lines. In June of 1933, the club purchased 18 lots to build a clubhouse, as current meetings were being held in the local elementary school or the Bremerton Booster Clubhouse. Ground was broken in the Spring of 1934, and the clubhouse was finished in June of 1937. Built by volunteers and the Works Progress Administration, the large clubhouse and grounds included a playfield and event hall. During World War II, the clubhouse became the regimental headquarters for the Army&#x27;s 202nd Coast Artillery, protecting the Navy installations in the area. The clubhouse still stands today, with regular events such as bingo and potlucks, along with the regularly scheduled club meetings.

<text>Michael John Mentzer (November 15, 1951June 10, 2001) was an American IFBB professional bodybuilder, businessman, and author. Born in Pennsylvania, Mentzer started bodybuilding when he was eleven years old. He won several amateur bodybuilding competitions before turning professional in 1979, including the 1976 Mr. America title and the heavyweight division of the 1978 IFBB Mr. Universe. In late 1979, he won the heavyweight class of the Mr. Olympia, but lost in the overall to Frank Zane. In the 1980 Mr. Olympia he placed fourth in a tie with Boyer Coe behind Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chris Dickerson and Frank Zane. 

Influenced by the concepts developed by Arthur Jones, Mentzer devised and successfully implemented his own theory of bodybuilding. One of the most iconic bodybuilders of all time, his &quot;Heavy Duty Training&quot; program still inspires lifters to this day. In 2002, he was inducted into the IFBB Hall of Fame.

==Early life and education==
Mike Mentzer was born on November 15, 1951, in the Germantown section of Philadelphia and his father was of German descent and his mother was of Italian descent. In grammar school and Ephrata High School, he received &quot;all A&#x27;s.&quot; He credits his 11th grade teacher, Elizabeth Schaub, for his &quot;love of language, thought, and writing.&quot; In 1975, he started attending the University of Maryland as a pre-med student where his hours away from the gym were spent in the study of &quot;genetics, physical chemistry, and organic chemistry.&quot; After three years of study at the University of Maryland he dropped out. He said his ultimate goal during that period was to become a psychiatrist.

==Bodybuilding career==

===Amateur===
Mentzer started bodybuilding when he was 11 years old at a body weight of after seeing the men on the covers of several muscle magazines. His father had bought him a set of weights and an instruction booklet. The booklet suggested that he train no more than three days a week, so Mike did just that. He attended the first Mr. Olympia and later said: “The 1965 Mr. Olympia contest was almost a religious experience for me.&quot; By age 15, his body weight had reached , at which Mike could bench press . Mike&#x27;s goal at the time was to look like his bodybuilding hero, Bill Pearl. After graduating from high school, Mentzer served four years in the United States Air Force. It was during this time he started working out over three hours a day, six days a week.

Mentzer started competing in local physique contests when he was 18 years old and attended his first contest in 1969. In 1971, Mentzer entered and won the Mr. Lancaster contest. In 1971 he suffered his worst defeat, placing 10th at the AAU Mr. America, which was won by Casey Viator. Mentzer considered his presence at this contest important later on, as he met Viator, who gave Mentzer the contact information for his trainer Arthur Jones. Due to a severe shoulder injury, he was forced to quit training from 1971 to 1974. In early 1975, however, he resumed training and returned to competition in 1975 at the Mr. America contest, placing third behind Robby Robinson and Roger Callard. Mentzer went on to win the competition the following year in 1976. He won the 1977 North America championships in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and competed a week later at the 1977 Mr. Universe in Nîmes, France, placing second to Kal Szkalak. In 1978, Mentzer won the Mr. Universe in Acapulco, Mexico with the first and only perfect 300 score. He became a professional bodybuilder after that 1978 Universe win.

In late 1979, Mentzer won the heavyweight class of the Mr. Olympia, again with a perfect 300 score, but he lost in the overall to Frank Zane (who was awarded his third title) that year. In the 1980 Mr. Olympia he placed fourth in a tie with Boyer Coe behind Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chris Dickerson, and Frank Zane.

===Retirement===
Mentzer retired from competitive bodybuilding after the 1980 Mr. Olympia at the age of 29. He maintained that the contest results were predetermined in favor of Schwarzenegger, and held this opinion throughout his life. While Mentzer never claimed he should have won, he maintained that Schwarzenegger should not have. Nevertheless, the two eventually had an amicable relationship.

===Legacy===
In 2002, Mentzer was inducted into the IFBB Hall of Fame. He appears in the music video for the Nantucket&#x27;s cover of &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to the Top&quot;.

===Bodybuilding philosophy===
Mentzer was an Objectivist and insisted that philosophy and bodybuilding are one and the same, stating that &quot;man is an indivisible entity, an integrated unit of mind and body.&quot; His books therefore concern themselves equally with philosophy and bodybuilding.

Mentzer followed the bodybuilding concepts developed by Arthur Jones and endeavored to perfect them. Through years of study, observation, knowledge of stress physiology, the most up-to-date scientific information available, and careful use of his reasoning abilities, Mentzer devised and successfully implemented his own theory of bodybuilding. Mentzer&#x27;s theories are intended to help a drug-free person achieve his or her full genetic potential within the shortest amount of time.

&quot;High-Intensity Training the Mike Mentzer Way&quot; was Mentzer&#x27;s final work. In it, he detailed the principles of high intensity weight training. Weight training, he insisted, had to be brief, infrequent, and intense, to attain the best results in the shortest amount of time. &quot;Heavy Duty II&quot; also espouses critical thinking. In this book, Mentzer shows why people need to use their reasoning ability to live happy, mature, adult lives, and he shows readers how to go about doing so. Bodybuilding was endorsed as only one potential component of an individual&#x27;s existence, encouraging many other worthwhile pursuits throughout his books.

===Diet and nutrition===
Diet has always been as important, if not more, than weight-training for bodybuilders. However, in his book &quot;Heavy Duty Nutrition&quot;, Mentzer demonstrated that nutrition for athletes did not need to be nearly as extreme as the bodybuilding industry would lead one to believe. His recommended diets were well balanced, and he espoused eating from all four food groups, totaling four servings each of high-quality grains and fruits, and two each of dairy and protein daily, all year-round.

Mentzer believed that carbohydrates should make up the bulk of the caloric intake, 50–60%, rather than protein as others preferred. Mentzer&#x27;s reasoning was simple: to build 10 pounds of muscle in a year, a total of 6000 extra calories needed to be ingested throughout the year, because one pound of muscle contains 600 calories. That averages 16 extra calories per day, and only four of them needed to be from protein—because muscle is 22% protein, about one quarter.

===Mentzer&#x27;s heavy-duty training system===
While Mike Mentzer served in the United States Air Force, he worked 12-hour shifts, and then followed that up with &#x27;marathon workouts&#x27; as was the accepted standard in those days. In his first bodybuilding contest, he met the winner, Casey Viator. Mentzer learned that Viator trained in very high intensity (heavy weights for as many repetitions as possible, to total muscle fatigue), for very brief (20–45 minutes per session) and infrequent training sessions. Mentzer also learned that Viator almost exclusively worked out with the relatively new Nautilus machines, created and marketed by Arthur Jones in DeLand, Florida. Mentzer and Jones soon met and became friends.

Jones pioneered the principles of high-intensity training in the late 1960s. He emphasized the need to maintain perfectly strict form, move the weights in a slow and controlled manner, work the muscles to complete failure (positive and negative), and avoid overtraining. Casey Viator saw fantastic results training under the direction of Jones, and Mentzer became very interested in this training philosophy. Eventually, however, Mentzer concluded that even Jones was not completely applying his own principles, so Mentzer began investigating a more full application of them. He began training clients in a near-experimental manner, evaluating the perfect number of repetitions, exercises, and days of rest to achieve maximum benefits.

For more than ten years, Mentzer&#x27;s Heavy Duty program involved 7–9 sets per workout on a three-day-per-week schedule. With the advent of &quot;modern bodybuilding&quot; (where bodybuilders became more massive than ever before) by the early 1990s, he ultimately modified that routine until there were fewer working sets and more days of rest. His first breakthrough became known as the &#x27;Ideal (Principled) Routine&#x27;, which was a fantastic step in minimal training. Outlined in &quot;High-Intensity Training the Mike Mentzer Way&quot;, fewer than five working sets were performed each session, and rest was emphasized, calling for 4–7 days of recovery before the next workout. He pushed sets beyond failure with such techniques as forced reps, negative reps, and static holds. According to Mentzer, biologists and physiologists since the nineteenth century have known that hypertrophy is directly related to intensity, not duration, of effort (Mentzer 2003;39). Most bodybuilding and weightlifting authorities do not take into account the severe nature of the stress imposed by heavy, strenuous resistance exercise carried to the point of positive muscular failure.

Mentzer&#x27;s training courses (books and audio tapes), sold through bodybuilding magazines, were extremely popular, beginning after Mentzer won the 1978 IFBB Mr. Universe contest. This contest gathered a lot of attention, because at it he became the first bodybuilder ever to receive a perfect 300 score from the judges. Some time later, Mentzer attracted more attention when he introduced Dorian Yates to high-intensity training, and put him through his first series of workouts in the early &#x27;90s. Yates went on to win the Mr. Olympia six consecutive times, from 1992 to 1997.

==Personal life==

===Beliefs about a Creator===
Mentzer stated in the last interview before his death that he did not believe in God &quot;as He is commonly defined&quot;, but that &quot;There is what&#x27;s called a rational view of a creator. As I said, there cannot be a God as He is commonly defined. God is infinite, God is everywhere, God created the universe - that&#x27;s an interesting one. There&#x27;s no such thing as creating the universe or causing the universe to come into existence, as the universe is the ground of all causation! If there was a God, He would have to consist of some material substance and He&#x27;d have to live somewhere. Therefore, existence always existed, even in the context you just gave. If, as you said, it was proven somehow beyond a shadow of a doubt there was a rational creator and a life hereafter, yes, I would grab at the chance to be with my mother and father again.&quot;

===Objectivism===
While in school, Mentzer&#x27;s father motivated his academic performance by providing him with various kinds of inducements, from a baseball glove to hard cash. Years later, Mike said that his father &quot;unwittingly ... was inculcating in me an appreciation of capitalism.&quot;

According to David M. Sears, a friend of Mentzer and an editor and publisher of his &quot;Muscles in Minutes&quot; book, he stated that:

Regarding what he learned from Ayn Rand, Mentzer said in an interview:

In his last interview before his death, Mentzer said he was delighted to get so many phone clients and close personal bodybuilding friends, such as Markus Reinhardt, who had been influenced by him to become Objectivists. He described Objectivism as the best philosophy ever devised. He also criticized the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, which he described as an &quot;evil philosophy,&quot; because according to him Kant set out to destroy man&#x27;s mind by undercutting his confidence in reason. He also criticized the teaching of Kantianism in schools and universities and said it&#x27;s very difficult for an Objectivist philosopher with a PhD to get a job in any of the universities.

==Final years and death==
In the late 1980s, Mentzer returned to training bodybuilders and writing for &quot;Iron Man&quot; magazine and spent much of the 1990s regaining his stature in the bodybuilding industry. Mentzer had met Dorian Yates in the 1980s and made an impression on Dorian&#x27;s bodybuilding career. Years later, when Yates won Joe Weider&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Olympia&quot;, he credited Mike&#x27;s &quot;Heavy Duty&quot; principles for his training. Mike, his brother Ray, and Dorian formed a clothing company called &quot;MYM&quot; for Mentzer Yates Mentzer, also known as &quot;Heavy Duty Inc&quot;, in 1994. MYM was based on the success of Don Smith&#x27;s &quot;CrazeeWear&quot; bodybuilding apparel. The three principals wanted to capitalize on the physically fit lifestyle, which today has gone mainstream. With the blessing and promotion of Joe Weider, the trio manufactured and distributed their own line of cut-and-sew sportswear.

Mentzer died on June 10, 2001, in Rolling Hills, California. He was found dead in his apartment, due to heart complications, by his younger brother and fellow bodybuilder Ray Mentzer. Two days later, Ray died from complications of Berger&#x27;s disease.

The average household size was 2.60 and the average family size was 3.09.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 28.4% under the age of 18, 9.1% from 18 to 24, 29.1% from 25 to 44, 23.4% from 45 to 64, and 9.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 96.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.6 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $41,869, and the median income for a family was $48,866. Males had a median income of $36,312 versus $24,127 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $17,643. About 6.4% of families and 9.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 10.5% of those under age 18 and 5.0% of those age 65 or over.

<text>Port Orchard is a city in and the county seat of Kitsap County, Washington, United States. It is located due west of West Seattle and is connected to Seattle and Vashon Island via the Washington State Ferries run to Southworth. It is named after Port Orchard, the strait that separates Bainbridge Island from the Kitsap Peninsula.

The population was 15,587 in the 2020 census, and estimated to be 17,089 in 2022.

==History==
The first European-Americans to settle in what is now Port Orchard were William Renton and Daniel Howard, who set up a sawmill there in 1854. The town that was to become Port Orchard was originally platted in 1886 by Frederick Stevens, who named the new location after his father, Sidney. The town of Sidney was incorporated September 15, 1890, and was the first in Kitsap County to be both platted and incorporated. Shortly thereafter, the U.S. Navy sought a suitable location for another installation on the West Coast, and found it with the assistance of Sidney&#x27;s residents in Orchard Bay (this installation would later become the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton).

The county seat was originally in Port Madison, but moved to Sidney after a popular vote in 1892. In December of that same year, the residents of Sidney petitioned both the state legislature and the Post Office Department to rename the city &quot;Port Orchard&quot;. The legislature refused, as Charleston (now West Bremerton) had also requested that name. The Post Office Department, however, went through with the name change, and as a result the Port Orchard post office ended up in Sidney, and the Charleston post office ended up in Port Orchard. It wasn&#x27;t until 1903 that local politician Will Thompson convinced the state legislature to correct this confusing situation, and relocated the Charleston post office to Charleston, at the same time renaming Sidney &quot;Port Orchard&quot;, as it is known today.

A new city hall was opened in May 1999, replacing a seismically vulnerable building constructed in 1947. It was to be a catalyst for new development in the city&#x27;s downtown.
On December 18, 2018, a cul-de-sac in Port Orchard was struck by an EF2 tornado with winds between , the strongest tornado in Washington since 1986. The tornado uprooted trees and damaged up to 450 homes and businesses, some of which sustained total roof loss. Some neighborhoods were evacuated due to reported gas leaks.

==Geography==
Port Orchard is located in south-central Kitsap County on the south side of Sinclair Inlet, an arm of the Port Orchard strait connecting to Puget Sound. The city is bordered to the north across Sinclair Inlet by the city of Bremerton.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , or 15.65%, are water.

The city is home to South Kitsap Regional Park, a public park with multiple fields and installations such as hiking trails, a playground, a skate park, and batting cages.

Port Orchard Airport, located south of the city, is a private airport with an industrial park.

<doc id="138052" wikidata="Q1509552" url="?curid=138052" title="Poulsbo, Washington">
<text>Poulsbo ( ) is a city on Liberty Bay in Kitsap County, Washington, United States. It is the smallest of the four cities in Kitsap County. The population was 11,970 at the 2020 census and an estimated 10,927 in 2018.

The Suquamish people have inhabited the surrounding area, called in Lushootseed, for millennia. After the signing of the Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855, many were moved to the Port Madison Indian Reservation. Poulsbo was then founded in the 1880s by Norwegian immigrant Jørgen Eliason, who was joined by other Scandinavians who relocated from the Midwestern states. They were drawn here by the availability of land, by the area&#x27;s rich resources, and by a landscape similar to their native home. The settlement was connected by boats to other areas of the region, including the Puget Sound mosquito fleet, which was eventually usurped by highways built in the early 20th century.

Modern-day downtown Poulsbo maintains a Scandinavian theme to honor its early immigrant history and is a popular regional tourist destination. One of its local products, Poulsbo Bread, is made locally at Sluys Bakery and used to be sold internationally. Many visitors arrive by boat; there are three marinas near the town, and the town&#x27;s harbor is an excellent anchorage.

==History==
The Suquamish people have inhabited Liberty Bay for millennia, hunting in local forests and floodplains, fishing in bays and streams, and harvesting shellfish along the shoreline. The site upon which the modern city is built is called , meaning &quot;maple trees&quot;. The Suquamish had a winter village nearby, at the head of Liberty Bay, anglicized variously as &quot;Ho-Cheeb&quot; and &quot;Xoyacid,&quot; which consisted of two large houses and four smaller houses. It existed until the late 1800s until settlers began populating the area.

After the signing of the Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855, most of the Suquamish people living in the area were relocated to the Port Madison Indian Reservation.

Founded by Norwegian immigrant Jørgen Eliason in the 1880s, Poulsbo was settled in its early years by a large number of Norwegian and other Scandinavian immigrants because of its similarities to their native countries. In 1886, Iver Brynildsen Moe, one of the early Norwegian settlers, suggested that the community should have a post office. Moe suggested the town be named &quot;Paulsbo&quot;, his hometown in Halden, Norway. The community&#x27;s petition for a post office was granted and Moe became the first postmaster, but authorities in Washington, D.C. misspelled the town&#x27;s name, likely misreading Moe&#x27;s handwriting, and the community became known as &quot;Poulsbo&quot; thereafter. Poulsbo was incorporated on December 18, 1907.

On September 15, 1914, after a dry summer with multiple previous brush fires, a large portion of the downtown business district was destroyed in a fire. Eight business buildings, an estimated third of the business section, were destroyed, with another damaged. The cause of the fire was never determined. Businessowners who lost their buildings continued business in undamaged buildings while downtown was rebuilt. After the fire, new buildings were constructed with cement rather than wood.

Until World War II, many Poulsbo residents retained Norwegian as a primary language. However, during World War II, the military constructed about 300 residential units to provide housing for workers at the nearby Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton. The population of Poulsbo almost tripled over three years, and the diversification of the population led to the dominance of English as the primary language.

On October 22, 1975, King Olav V of Norway visited Poulsbo as part of the celebration of 150 years of Norwegian immigration to the United States. His son, Harald, visited 20 years later.

==Education==
Poulsbo is home to many different public schools in the North Kitsap School District. North Kitsap High School, Poulsbo Middle School, Poulsbo Elementary School and Vinland Elementary School are located within the city limits, while Pearson Elementary School lies south of town. Private schools include Gateway Christian School and West Sound Academy. Post-secondary undergraduate education includes Olympic College Poulsbo.

Chief Kitsap Academy in Suquamish is outside of the Poulsbo city limits and has a Poulsbo postal address.

Northwest College of Art &amp; Design was formerly in the Poulsbo area. The school, established in 1982 as the Northwest College of Art, was initially in Lemolo in Poulsbo. In 1991 the institution began leasing the former Mains Manor in Suquamish, which was purchased in 2000. The Suquamish tribe had purchased the former college building for $5.03 million on November 28, 2017, and made it into the current Chief Kitsap Building. The college, at that time, moved to Tacoma, having purchased a building there.

<text>Silverdale is an unincorporated community in Kitsap County, Washington, in the United States. Despite many failed attempts at incorporation, Silverdale has not become a city. The population was 20,733 at the 2020 census. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Silverdale as a census-designated place (CDP).

Silverdale ranks 158th among 522 areas in Washington for which per capita income data is collected.

==History==

Early attempts to incorporate Silverdale as a city resulted in failed ballot measures in 1941 and 1985. An incorporation referendum in November 1999 was initially defeated by a five-vote margin out of 4,000 votes cast. The election was marred by irregularities, including the inclusion of the ballot question for voters outside the proposed city boundaries and exclusion for voters inside the proposed boundaries. A re-vote was held on February 1, 2000, and rejected by a wider margin. A similar measure in February 2013 was rejected by 70% of voters.

==Geography==
Silverdale is south of the US Navy Trident Missile Base Kitsap, northwest of the city of Bremerton and the same distance south of Poulsbo. Silverdale lies at the north tip of Dyes Inlet, which connects it to Bremerton via Sinclair Inlet and to the Pacific Ocean via Port Orchard and Puget Sound. Strawberry Creek flows through the Old Town area.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP of Silverdale has a total area of , of which are land and , or 7.10%, are water.

==Demographics==

The racial makeup of the CDP in 2020-2021 was 66.8% White, 9.7% Asian, 5.8% Black Or African American, 0.4% American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.3% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 7.3% Hispanic or Latino, and 12.2% from two or more races.

As of 2021, of the 8,351 households in Silverdale, the age breakdown by percentage was 6.1% under 5 years old, 20.5% under 18 years, and 16.9% over the age of 65. 49.5 of the population was female. The average family size was 2.53 people.

The median income for a household in the CDP between 2017 and 2021 was $87,558. The per capita income for the CDP was $42,024. About 7.4% of the population was below the poverty line.

==Commerce==
Commerce in Silverdale is primarily divided into two geographic areas: Old Town Silverdale along the northeast edge of Dyes Inlet, and the area just north within SR 3 and SR 303 featuring Kitsap Mall, and other big box stores. In addition to the Port of Silverdale, Old Town Silverdale is home to many salons, restaurants, and medical offices.

== Education ==

=== Public schools ===
Central Kitsap School District serves about 11,243 students from kindergarten through grade 12 (2022–2023). The district has two high schools serving grades 9 to 12, one secondary school serving grades 7 to 12, three middle schools serving grades six to eight, three satellite programs, 12 elementary schools, and a home-school support program. In addition, the district offers both junior high- and high school-level alternative programs. The overall graduation rate as of 2021-2022 is 87%, above the statewide rate of 82%.

On September 8, 2017, construction began on the new Central Kitsap Campus which will house Central Kitsap High School and Central Kitsap Middle School. The current buildings were built in 1942 and 1959 respectively. It is expected that middle school students will be able to move into the new building in Spring 2019 while high school students will move in Fall 2019. Construction for the new campus was contracted through Skanksa for $77.9 million. Central Kitsap School District sold the naming rights to the new campus&#x27; stadium to Kitsap Credit Union for $500,000. The stadium will be named &quot;Kitsap Credit Union Athletic Complex.&quot;

==Health==
A branch of what was then, Harrison Medical Center, now St. Michael Medical Center, opened on Myhre Road in 2000. St. Michael Medical Center is a part of Virginia Mason Franciscan Health, under Catholic Health Initiatives (CHI). A new expansion to St. Michael Medical Center was completed and opened to the public in December 2020. The hospital features a Level III Trauma Center and helipad, birth center, and cancer care. St. Michael Medical Center is in America&#x27;s 50 Best Hospitals for cardiac surgery (2021).

<text>Cle Elum ( ) is a city in Kittitas County, Washington, United States. The population was 2,157 at the 2020 census. About by car from Seattle, Cle Elum is a popular area for camping and outdoor activities. It is also unofficially considered the starting point of Eastern Washington when driving east on I-90 from Seattle, although this is somewhat arbitrary since many consider either the town of Easton, anywhere east of Keechelus Lake, or the wildlife crossing bridge over I-90 to be the starting point.

The town takes its name from the Cle Elum River, which meets the Yakima River near here. The Kittitas band of the Yakama tribe lived here and fished the Yakima River. In the 1800s, settlers traveled through on their way to Puget Sound, and the Kittitas band was eventually displaced to a reservation. The settlement here had a large sawmill and a train depot, and the town was incorporated in 1902.

==History==

=== Native history ===
Cle Elum was originally inhabited by the Kittitas band of the Yakama tribe. The tribe fished salmon, steelhead, and trout from the Yakima River. The Salmon la Sac trails in the northern area of the region were created by the Kittitas people and were used as layovers for journeys into the higher altitudes of the Cascade Range. In 1855, after the arrival of Catholic missionaries, and the passing through of settlers and coal miners on their way to the Puget Sound, a treaty resulted in the Yakamas ceding most of their land for a reservation in the lower Yakima Valley and guaranteed access to fish, including what would later be incorporated as Cle Elum. By 1859, the Kittitas had been forced to relocate to the Yakama Indian Reservation.

=== Early years and industries ===
In the spring of 1886, Northern Pacific Railway surveyors Virgil Bogue and Herbert Huson were making their way through the region with the intent of establishing a station. At the site of the future city, a depot was named Clealum after the Kittitas name Tle-el-Lum (tlielləm), meaning &quot;swift water&quot;, referring to the Cle Elum River. Maps of the United States Postal Guide used two words while other early maps show it as one word: &quot;Clealum&quot;. In 1908, Clealum was altered to Cle Elum. The name was given to the river, the city, and Cle Elum Lake.

Walter Reed entered into a partnership with Thomas Johnson of Ellensburg and laid out as a town site which was legally dedicated on July 26, 1886. Johnson had owned a sawmill on Wilson Creek, in Grant County and he moved the mill to the new location in the vicinity of the new town. The partners Reed and Johnson established what was undoubtedly the largest mill up to that time in central or Eastern Washington, cutting of board lumber per day. At the same time, Frederick Leonhard, who, with his brother-in-law, Gerrit d&#x27;Ablaing, had been carrying on a mill on Cooke Creek and later on the Naneum, moved to the vicinity of Cle Elum. They cut a large part of the lumber for the Stampede Tunnel.

===The early 20th century===

Cle Elum was officially incorporated on February 12, 1902.

Tragedy struck the area when on July 16, 1908, two carloads of blasting powder being unloaded by the Northwest Improvement Company exploded, killing at least nine people including miners, NIC store employees and a family with children living in a tent near the building. The explosion, located about three-quarters of a mile from Cle Elum&#x27;s downtown, scattered debris and human remains and shattered windows across town. Accounts from residents equated the explosion to an earthquake.

In December 1910, loggers working for the Cascade Lumber Company near Cle Elum went on strike after the company reduced pay and began charging $5 per week for board. ()

In 1913, steps were taken to improve automobile access across the Cascade Mountains via Snoqualmie Pass. A $1,500,000 levy () was approved in 1913 to improve and expand the state&#x27;s highways. The largest project award from the levy ($590,743) went to construction of the Sunset Highway between Spokane and Seattle. This major cross-state highway would pass directly through Cle Elum&#x27;s business district, and as it was one of the first towns reached after traveling east across the pass, would greatly benefit from its construction. That same year, reflecting on the prosperity of the coal mines, the city&#x27;s second bank was chartered. By 1914, Cle Elum&#x27;s population had risen to 3,000 from about 100 at the turn of the 20th century.

===Great fire of 1918===
Cle Elum&#x27;s greatest disaster occurred on June 25, 1918, when a huge fire wiped out over seventy acres of the city (29 city blocks) causing over $500,000 (about $ today) in damages. The cause was later determined to most likely to be a cigarette butt thrown into a pile of garbage behind a theater. Thirty businesses and 205 houses were destroyed, leaving more than 1,800 people homeless. Following the incident, aid from across the state began pouring in. The Red Cross brought tents from Camp Lewis to house displaced citizens while soldiers were sent from Ellensburg to guard businesses. Yakima and Portland also sent aid to the city. No people died in the incident.

High insurance rates on Cle Elum&#x27;s many wooden structures inhibited many people from purchasing them. One of the few buildings in downtown Cle Elum to survive the fire was the Cle Elum State Bank Building, built in 1906; it still stands today. The rest of downtown was quickly rebuilt with brick and many of these buildings still stand.

===Bankruptcy===

In 2011, the city government approved a development agreement with City Heights, who sought to create a planned community with 962 homes on in the Cle Elum area. City Height announced in 2019 that it would begin construction of the development, named &quot;Ederra&quot;, under the existing agreement, while the City of Cle Elum proposed new conditions to address various concerns. City Heights filed a lawsuit against the city government for a breach of the original agreement. An arbitrator ruled in November 2024 that the city government owed $22.2 million to City Heights for violating the agreement along with reimbursement of legal fees and other expenses. A 20-year payment plan with 6% monthly interest was proposed to cover the debt, which the city government could not pay with its existing revenue sources. As a result, the city council voted to seek Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection on January 28, 2025. Cle Elum would become the second city in Washington to file for bankruptcy after North Bonneville in 1991.

==Geography==
Cle Elum is located ESE of Seattle, NNW of Yakima, and WSW of Wenatchee.

Cle Elum has a humid continental climate, Köppen subtype &quot;Dsb&quot;. The elevation is and temperatures are cooler than areas to the east. The coldest month is December, a trait common in the Pacific Northwest. But hot temperatures still occur, and not only in summer: on March 18, 1968, the temperature reached . Cle Elum, lying on the less extreme part of the Cascade Range rain shadow, also sees more precipitation than more arid regions to the east but also less than the areas to the west.

The climate has warmed in tandem with surrounding areas; climate data further back shows that winters were once colder, and that January was historically the coldest month.

<text>Kittitas () is a city in Kittitas County, Washington, United States. The population was 1,438 at the 2020 census. It is also a part of the Ellensburg micropolitan area.

There are numerous interpretations of the name, which is from the language of the Kittitas American Indian Sahaptin language. According to toponymist William Bright, the name &quot;Kittitas&quot; comes from the Sahaptin placename [k&#x27;ɨtɨtáš], referring to a gravel bank in the Yakima River. According to Jennifer Cochran, it &quot;has been said to mean everything from &#x27;white chalk&#x27; to &#x27;shale rock&#x27; to &#x27;shoal people&#x27; to &#x27;land of beauty&#x27;, and that most anthropologists and historians concede that each interpretation has some validity depending upon the particular dialect spoken.&quot;


==History==

Kittitas was established in 1883 and officially incorporated on December 9, 1931. It was founded as part of the westward expansion of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. The Kittitas Yard and Depot became the center of the community of Kittitas, one of the many small, agricultural towns that sprang up along the railroad lines. The railroad linked Kittitas to other small communities and the rest of the country, providing farmers and business people a way to sell their products in other towns and cities.

A post office, general merchandise and drug store, a Baptist church, agricultural warehouses, and other small businesses were built around the small depot. Along with the depot, the Kittitas Yard included storage and maintenance buildings, a water tower, and other structures necessary for the maintenance of a major transcontinental railroad.

The depot is the only significant structure still intact at the Kittitas Yard. It is an excellent example of turn-of-the-century railroad architecture, and as such was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. The depot is owned and managed by the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission.

The Milwaukee Road, the popular name for the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, and Pacific Railroad, was founded in 1847 to serve the area from Mississippi to Wisconsin. Within 50 years, it became one of the most prosperous railroads in the country. In 1905, Milwaukee Road officials began expanding west, running lines from Chicago to Seattle. At the same time, they decided to electrify the lines through the western mountains, to increase operating efficiency. Despite the increased efficiency, the financial stability of the railroad began to crumble, prompted by the high cost of the western expansion, electrical expenses, and competition with other railroads and ships using the newly opened Panama Canal. In 1980, the last Milwaukee train traveled over the Cascades, and thereafter the system served only the Midwest.

The Milwaukee Road once served as a vital link, providing economic and social connections between small, scattered communities in Washington. Today, it is once more a link between these communities, for people who hike, bike, or ride horses along the route. Stretching more than from Cedar Falls near North Bend to Tekoa at the Idaho border, the John Wayne Pioneer Trail passes through tunnels, over mountains, along rivers and lakes, and through dry, sagebrush countryside.

<text>Roslyn is a city in Kittitas County, Washington, United States. The population was 950 at the 2020 census. Roslyn is located in the Cascade Mountains, about 80 miles east of Seattle. The town was founded in 1886 as a coal mining company town. During the 20th century, the town gradually transitioned away from coal, and today its economy is primarily based on forestry and tourism. The town was the filming location for &quot;The Runner Stumbles&quot;, &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;, and &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot;. Many of the town&#x27;s historical structures have been preserved, and its downtown was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.
==History==
===Early history===
Coal deposits were first noted in the Roslyn area in 1883, with a large vein discovered at the upper Smith Creek canyon in 1885 by C.P. Brosious, Walter J. Reed, and Ignatius A. Navarre. Roslyn was platted in 1886 by Logan M. Bullet, vice president of the Northern Pacific Coal Company, at the time that the company initiated the first commercial coal mining operations there, to support railway operations.

Throughout the mid-1880s, the Northern Pacific Railway, the parent of Northern Pacific Coal Company, pushed from the east to reach Puget Sound across the Cascade Mountains. The Northern Pacific began building across Stampede Pass just west of Roslyn, approaching from Wallula in the east and Tacoma in the west. A 77-mile (124-km) gap remained in 1886. In January of that year, Nelson Bennett was given a contract to construct a 9,850 foot (3,002 m) tunnel under Stampede Pass, completing it in 1888. Roslyn, which lies on the route to Stampede Pass, provided the coal for the railway construction work as well as the continuing railroad operations.

Between 1886 and 1929, immigrant workers from countries such as Italy, Poland, Slovakia, Germany, Lithuania, Slovenia, Serbia and Croatia as well as from England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales came to work in the mines.

In 1892, 45 miners were killed in an explosion at Mine No. 1 near Roslyn, the deadliest mining accident in Washington history.

Roslyn&#x27;s peak coal mine production of nearly 2 million tons was reached in 1910. As coal-fired steam trains were being replaced by diesel power, the last mine in the area closed in 1963 as business became unprofitable.

As Roslyn was a &quot;company town&quot;, life in the early years was centered around the production of coal. Most of the citizens of the town worked either for the Northern Pacific Coal Company or in one of the smaller businesses monopolized by the company, or were family members of someone who did. A hub of life in the town was the Northwestern Improvement Company Store, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places; it still stands at the corner of First Street and Pennsylvania Avenue.

Most of the town&#x27;s 500 homes were built in the 1920s on land owned by the railroad. The 1920s-era commercial district consisted of four square blocks, of which about one dozen buildings remain as representatives of western frontier commercial architecture. Roslyn has many examples of Victorian elegance in its surviving buildings, as well as simple miner&#x27;s shacks. The town of Roslyn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

===Knights of Labor Strike of 1888 and African American migration===

Tensions between management and labor in the Roslyn mines began spilling over in the summer of 1888, when management laid off a number of labor union workers who were petitioning for eight-hour work days and higher wages. These layoffs led to a labor strike by the Knights of Labor, which shut down the mines. Northwest Coal Company, which conducted mining operations at Mine No. 3, a few miles away in nearby Ronald, responded by recruiting strikebreakers. This included 50 black laborers from the East and Midwest who were transported by train with almost 40 private armed guards. The recruitment of these armed forces raised the interest of Territorial Governor Eugene Semple when he heard that they harassed area residents calling themselves U.S. Marshals. This was considered a paramilitary challenge to Washington Territory authority and Semple ordered the local sheriff to disperse the unit.

Semple visited Roslyn to investigate Northwest Coal Company&#x27;s practices and condemned the company for hiring a private militia on suppositions that the white strikers would attack black laborers and overpower police forces. Semple&#x27;s report describes the residents as &quot;intelligent&quot; and &quot;law-abiding,&quot; and the company&#x27;s suppositions as erroneous. He did not intervene on the labor disputes, and strikers continued to lose ground in negotiations.
In a span of two years, the company recruited more than 300 black laborers from Virginia, North Carolina, and Kentucky. Many relocated with families, and this migration was the largest increase in the African-American population of Washington Territory up until that time. Sheriff Packwood of Kittitas County reported to Semple that relations between out-of-work white workers and the black population were strained with potential to turn violent. However, after the strike broke tensions reduced, and whites reconciled with working along black miners. As the regional coal industry boomed, competition for employment reduced, and eventually workers organized as equals with United Mine Workers.

=== African American population ===
In 1890, Roslyn&#x27;s African American population was 22%, one of the highest in the state. Black fraternal organization lodges and civic institutions were established, including Prince Hall Masons, Knights of Pythias of North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia, Prince Hall Order of the Eastern Star, Daughters of Tabernacle, and African Methodist Episcopal Church. The Black population began to decline after the mines closed in 1963, and by the early 1970s only the Craven family remained. William Craven was elected mayor of Roslyn in 1976, and was the first African American mayor in the state of Washington.

The Roslyn Black Pioneers was established by Ethel Florence Craven to preserve and promote black history in Washington. The organization received a grant from Humanities Washington to build educational floats for Washington parades.

===Roslyn&#x27;s ethnic cemeteries===

The Roslyn Cemetery is composed of 26 separate but adjacent cemetery plots, reflecting the diversity of early immigrant society. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

===Post mining era===
Although Roslyn clings to its coal mining and timber harvesting past, it has become a tourist and recreation destination. Tourism to the town received a boost when it was featured as the filming location for &quot;The Runner Stumbles&quot; and &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;. 

As many as 2,000 luxury homes are being developed nearby, potentially adding to the old town&#x27;s population. Forests once owned and managed by Plum Creek Timber Company have been sold to two development companies, which are in the process of developing an extensive golf course community with houses and condominiums on the boundary of Roslyn. The new community is called Suncadia. As in similar small towns being transformed by large-scale capital projects and outside investment, these changes are expected to significantly improve Roslyn.

However, some community members in Roslyn were concerned about the effects a Master Planned Resort would have on their community&#x27;s economy and ecology. A Roslyn-based citizen group called RIDGE engaged Suncadia&#x27;s owners in litigation to mitigate the effects of the resort. RIDGE and MountainStar Resort Development—who owned the land at the time—engaged in negotiations and signed the RIDGE Settlement Agreement in 2001. Though the Settlement Agreement was eventually dissolved in 2013 when Kittitas County Judge Scott R. Sparks terminated the Agreement and all remaining claims, the Settlement Agreement was successful in some of their mitigations such as Suncadia&#x27;s purchase and donation of the Roslyn Urban Forest to the city of Roslyn and the Suncadia Resort being developed and built using labor paid Washington state&#x27;s prevailing wage.

==Geography==

<text>Snoqualmie Pass is a census-designated place (CDP) in Kittitas County, Washington, United States. It includes the unincorporated community of Hyak. The population was 311 at the 2010 census.

The CDP is named for the mountain pass that carries Interstate 90 across the Cascade Range, which itself is named for the Snoqualmie tribe, a Native American tribe indigenous to the Snoqualmie Valley located west of the pass. The portion of the mountain pass west of the height of land, in King County, is not part of the Snoqualmie Pass CDP.

Based on per capita income, Snoqualmie Pass ranks 8th of 522 areas in the state of Washington to be ranked. It is also the highest rank achieved in Kittitas County.

== Recreation ==
The area consists of mountain chalets and condominiums that are mainly seasonally occupied by residents of the Seattle metropolitan area, with approximately 300 year-round residents. Winter sports are the main draw, but outdoor recreation is available year-round.

The Pacific Crest Trail crosses through Snoqualmie Pass, and a variety of other trails are also available for hiking and climbing in the summer and cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in the winter.

Snoqualmie Pass is the site of the Summit at Snoqualmie, a group of alpine ski areas managed by Boyne USA Resorts. The Summit consists of four ski areas: Alpental, Summit West (formerly named Snoqualmie Summit), Summit Central (formerly Ski Acres), and Summit East (formerly Hyak). The Summit at Snoqualmie is the closest ski area to Seattle, so it is often crowded on weekends. Iron Horse State Park in Hyak offers groomed cross-country ski trails, sledding and snowshoeing in winter and hiking and a gravel railroad bed for hiking and bicycling in the summer.

Snowmobiling just east of the pass is also popular during the winter months. Also in the summer and fall, paragliders and hang gliders may be seen flying above the valley, along the ridge and landing at Lake Keechelus.

==Geography==

The community is in westernmost Kittitas County, on the east side of Snoqualmie Pass. Its western border follows the King County border, which is also the height of land of the Cascade Range. The CDP extends southeast as far as Keechelus Lake, the source of the Yakima River. The unincorporated community of Hyak is in the southeast part of the CDP.

Interstate 90 passes through the community, with access from Exits 53 and 54. I-90 leads west to Seattle and southeast the same distance to Ellensburg, the Kittitas county seat. Washington State Route 906 serves as a local main road through the Snoqualmie Pass community, connecting with I-90 at both of its exits.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Snoqualmie Pass CDP has a total area of , all of it land. Situated at a main crossing point of the Cascade Range, Snoqualmie Pass is located along the Mountains to Sound Greenway, which spans parts of King and Kittitas counties. The eastern portal of the Snoqualmie Tunnel is in the CDP at Hyak.

===Climate===
Due to its elevation, Snoqualmie Pass experiences significantly lower temperatures than Seattle, and receives much more precipitation, much of it being snow. Snoqualmie Pass has a humid continental climate (Koppen: Dsb bordering Csb) with cold, very wet and snowy winters, and mild to warm, relatively dry summers.

<text>Thorp ( ) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Kittitas County, Washington, United States. In 2020, the population was 232.

The town of Thorp is east of Seattle, northwest of Ellensburg, and southeast of Cle Elum. It is located at the narrow west end of the Kittitas Valley, where high elevation forests of the Cascade Range give way to cattle ranches surrounded by farmlands noted for timothy hay, alfalfa, vegetables, and fruit production.

Thorp is named for Fielden Mortimer Thorp, recognized as the first permanent white settler in the Kittitas Valley. He established a homestead at the approach to Taneum Canyon (, ) near the present-day town in 1868. &quot;Klála&quot;, an ancient Native American village and the largest indigenous settlement in the Kittitas Valley at the arrival of the first white settlers, was located about one mile above the current town site.

==Geography==

Thorp is located in central Kittitas County at (47.068006, -120.672687). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land.

The town site of Thorp is above the flood plain of the upper Yakima River at an elevation of . It is situated near the river&#x27;s west bank directly opposite the Hayward Hill slide area and Clark Flats, near the southeastern approach to the Yakima River canyon at the foot of Thorp Prairie. To the west of the town is Taneum Canyon, and to the northwest are Elk Heights, Morrison Canyon and the Sunlight Waters private residential subdivision. Ellensburg, the county seat, is southeast of Thorp.

Northwest of Thorp at the junction of SR 10 and Thorp Highway, the Yakima River emerges from a canyon parallel to a basalt flow, the uppermost layers of which have been dated to 10.5 million years. The Thorp Prairie sits atop the basalt flows and ends at a deep canyon of Miocene columnar basalt structures carved by Swauk Creek whose headwaters are at Blewett Pass along US 97 to the north. The Thorp Prairie deposits were also delivered by the Thorp Glacial episode.

===Topography===
North and northeast of the town of Thorp along the Yakima River channel is the gradual upward lift of the Thorp Drift, marked by an elevation change due to the incline onto the terminal moraine that marks the furthest advance of the Thorp Glacial stage. Here the Thorp Gravels, which are named for the town of Thorp and the Thorp Glacial episode, are exposed along the ancient river channel in what is known as the &quot;Slide Area&quot;. The gravels were formed at the terminus of the Thorp Glacial advance approximately 600,000 years ago.

The Thorp Gravels themselves are believed to be between 3 and 4 million years old. The whole structure is composed of individually layered belts of gravel and sand which are not well consolidated, continually weather, and are prone to continuing erosion and landslides averaging 30 degrees. The area is rich with wildlife, including bald eagles and osprey who hunt for prey along the river. It is also a crossing point for deer and elk who often can be seen at dawn and dusk heading to the river for water.

About west of Thorp, the first glimpses of the Columbia River Plateau are seen where the Yakima River has cut into the westernmost edge of the basalt plateau. The Columbia Plateau basalt formed when lava poured out of fissures in the ground across eastern Washington during the Miocene era, 17 to 20 million years ago, erupting intermittently for over 10 million years. Many layers of basalt successively flowed over one another, back when the area was still flat. Subsequent to the Miocene lava flows, the volcanoes of the Cascade Mountains actively erupted, depositing ash, cinders, pumice and mudflows that eventually inter-fingered with the alternating basalt layers throughout the region.
Interstate 90 drops through the Thorp Drift, which marks the oldest and furthest reaching known glacial moraine in the Kittitas Valley. Changes in the types of vegetation become more evident in this area. The changes are the result of a drop in elevation of about 1,400 feet from the summit of Snoqualmie Pass to Thorp, and a significant drop in precipitation of about 107 inches average a year at the summit of Snoqualmie Pass, to 42.94 inches average a year at Thorp.

At the bottom of the Thorp Drift moraine the view opens up into the Kittitas Valley which is deeply buried in river gravel deposited by the ancient Yakima River. This valley is a syncline that creates the Ellensburg Basin located between Mission Ridge to the north and Manastash Ridge to the south. The Ellensburg Basin, more formally called the Ellensburg Formation, holds nearly 4,000 feet of rock, sand, and gravel that accumulated over a period of 2 to 10 million years during the Miocene and lower Pliocene age.

===Climate===
The climate at Thorp is hot during summer when temperatures tend to be in the 80s, and very cold during winter when temperatures tend to be in the 20s.

The warmest month of the year at Thorp is July, with an average high of 77.2 °F and an average low of 51.8 °F. The coldest month of the year is January, with an average low of 16.5 °F and an average high of 34.3 °F. Temperature variations between night and day tend to be relatively large during summer with a difference that can reach 30 °F, and fairly limited during winter with temperatures hovering at or below freezing for most of the day, and often dipping below zero at night.

Temperatures generally drop significantly in October, while rainfall rises from less than half an inch to nearly 5 inches average per month. This trend continues through late autumn and winter, with a marked drop in precipitation beginning in April which coincides with a gradual rise in temperature into late spring and summer.

There is significant variation in rainfall throughout the year, with December and January receiving a mix of rainfall and snow, averaging 9.06 and 7.94 inches respectively. Rainfall during summer is, on average, less than half an inch each month with July receiving the lowest monthly average precipitation of the year at .07 inches.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 273 people, 103 households, and 74 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 221.2 people per square mile (85.7/km2). There were 107 housing units at an average density of 86.7/sq mi (33.6/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 93.41% White, 1.10% Native American, 1.83% from other races, and 3.66% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.20% of the population.

There were 103 households, out of which 44.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.3% were married couples living together, 14.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 27.2% were non-families. 24.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.65 and the average family size was 3.17.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 33.0% under the age of 18, 4.8% from 18 to 24, 27.1% from 25 to 44, 26.0% from 45 to 64, and 9.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 113.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.8 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $33,125, and the median income for a family was $45,625. Males had a median income of $31,250 versus $22,500 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $17,772. About 5.6% of families and 5.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 5.2% of those under the age of eighteen and 19.2% of those 65 or over.

==History==
===Native Americans===
The Kittitas Valley was occupied by the Kittitas (Yakama Ichishkíin Sínwit: &quot;Ki-tatash&quot;) or Upper Yakama tribe, as well as hunting and food gathering parties of Cayuse and Nez Perce. The area was rich in wild berries, fish and game, and neighboring tribes annually converged on the valley in April or May to harvest Indian onions (&quot;Allium spp.&quot;), Indian potatoes (&quot;Claytonia lanceolata&quot;), and breadroot (&quot;Lomatium canbyi&quot;). The various tribes engaged in horse trading with early British and American fur traders, and had peaceful relations with Jesuit Catholic missionaries who preceded them.

In the 1840s, white settlers began to pour into the Oregon Territory (and later Washington Territory), bringing with them a measles epidemic and other diseases deadly to the indigenous population. That, coupled with cultural differences such as plowing the ground, which was seen as desecrating the spirit of the earth, led to confrontation between Native Americans and white settlers.

The largest indigenous settlement in the Kittitas Valley at the arrival of the white settlers was &quot;Klála&quot;, a village of around 500 people located about one mile above the present town of Thorp along the Yakima River opposite the mouth of Taneum Creek. Further up the river, about six miles northwest of present-day Thorp was the village of &quot;Tátxanixsha&quot;, and four miles below Thorp was a village of around 400 people called &quot;Yumi&#x27;sh&quot;.

Among the earliest records of Native American interaction with frontiersmen in the Kittitas Valley took place in 1858, the summer of the Yakima War, when a large contingency of Wanapum from Priest Rapids camped at the head of Taneum Canyon very close to where the town of Thorp is now located.

They were led by Smohalla, the legendary dreamer-prophet associated with the Washani or &quot;Dreamer Movement&quot; among the native peoples of the Pacific Northwest. Smohalla claimed that visions came to him through dreams, and he preached a return to the original way of life before white influences which included ritual music and dancing. His speaking was called &quot;Yuyunipitqana&quot; for “Shouting Mountain&quot;.

Rumors floated that Smohalla was preparing for battle. An exchange took place in which Rev. George W. Kennedy, a frontier Methodist preacher, traveled to the location of the camp in an attempt to make peace as he had become alarmed that such a large assembly meant hostility. By all accounts, Smohalla was not easily intimidated. &quot;He looked like a king. Stolid as a statue,&quot; Kennedy said of meeting him. The preacher exhorted, &quot;God had made us all brothers and not enemies&quot; and &quot;the Great Father want[s] us all to live together in peace on earth.&quot;

If that is true, Smohalla demanded, &quot;Why has the white man taken our lands from us? Has the white man any rights here in [the] Kittitas that the Indian has any right to respect? The Indian came first.&quot;

It was, Kennedy conceded, &quot;an unanswerable speech ... And I promised utmost friendship on the part of the white brothers. We gave them our hand shake and pronounced benediction of God on them, and Chief Smohalla agreed to accept that as the Pipe of Peace.&quot;

===Thorp pioneers===
Until the mid-1850s, the Kittitas Valley saw little encroachment by pioneer settlers. But in 1853, the first immigrant wagon trains passed through the area led by David Longmore. During that same year, George B. McClellan conducted a survey of the valley on behalf of the Northern Pacific Railroad, and two years later Charles Splawn briefly passed through the area.

Andrew Jackson Splawn, who traversed the valley in 1861 on his way to the nearby mines with his cattle, wrote of his experience:

&quot;It was on the fourth day out that we came to the beautiful Kittitas valley. This valley, as it looked that day to me, a boy of 16, was the lovliest spot I had ever seen. To the west stood the great Cascade range; to the north rose the snow-capped peaks of the Peshastin to guard the beautiful valley below where the Yakima River wound its way full-length, while from the mountains on the north flowed numerous small streams and the whole plain was covered with a thick coat of grass.&quot;

Fielden Mortimer (F. M.) Thorp is recognized as the first white settler in the Yakima Valley, prior to his subsequent move to the pleasant surroundings of the present-day town of Thorp. Rudimentary county government was formed in Yakima County in 1865, and business was transacted at the home of F. M. Thorp near Moxee until another suitable location could be found.

Settlers began to trickle into the Kittitas Valley with the opening of the Snoqualmie Wagon Road in 1867, which approximated the modern-day route of Interstate 90 past Thorp, from Seattle to Ellensburg. Among these first adventurous individuals were F. M. Thorp and Charles Splawn, whose families had united with the marriage of Charles Splawn, a brother of Senator Andrew Jackson Splawn of Yakima, to Thorp&#x27;s daughter Dulcena in 1863.

In 1868, they became the first permanent white settlers in the Kittitas Valley, building the Thorp and Splawn homesteads at the head of Taneum Canyon on the banks of Taneum Creek. This location, not more than a mile from the present town of Thorp, provided ideal shelter for their wintering cattle, as well as offering water and fertile soils for agriculture. Charles Splawn operated a tavern, or roadhouse, at this location which served as an overnight stop for travelers crossing the Snoqualmie Trail.

Shortly thereafter, the F. M. Thorp and Charles Splawn families were joined by their friend Walter J. Reed, the second settler in the Kittitas Valley, who later established the community of Cle Elum. Tillman Houser, another early settler who brought his family over Snoqualmie Pass to settle on Coleman Creek, entered the valley on June 16 of that same year, and was later joined by Martin Dervan and his wife. The first post office in the Kittitas Valley was established as Taneum Station at the home of F. M. Thorp in 1869.

Antoine Bertram was a Yakama Indian who moved to the Thorp area with the Charles Splawn and the F. M. Thorp families. He farmed the area with his first wife Emma Pahofta, the daughter of Indian John (for whom Indian John Hill, and the Indian John Hill Rest Area on Interstate 90 between Cle Elum and Thorp are named). Later in life he married Emma&#x27;s sister Lucy Pahofta. Antoine helped Thorp and Splawn tend their cattle. Keneho, another friendly Indian of Yakama descent, was paid ten dollars by Charles Splawn for each trip to carry the mail over the Snoqualmie Trail to and from the Taneum Station post office.

Among the mysterious landmarks in the Thorp area is stone slab marking a grave at Tamarack Springs in the Taneum Canyon, which reads, &quot;A White Woman&#x27;s Grave.&quot; This grave belongs to the wife of Al Williams, whose wife was killed at the springs in 1870. Williams and his wife were traveling through the area and became lost. They were directed by an Indian to follow the Tamarack Trail, since it was the closest route to a settlement. In hurrying to their destination, the woman&#x27;s horse stumbled over a log and fell. A letter written by Charles Splawn explains the tragic events:

&quot;Because his wife was expecting a baby, they started to go to a settlement. The horse Mrs. Williams was riding fell while jumping a log. The child was born prematurely and the mother and baby died. Williams buried his wife and child as best he could. And rode down into the valley. He afterwards came back to remove the bodies. Thorp, Splawn and Rego advised him not to. They told him she was a pioneer&#x27;s daughter and a pioneer&#x27;s wife and she should rest in a pioneer grave.&quot;

Years later, according to the late Mrs. W. D. Bruton of Thorp, a marker was placed over the grave by Matt Pointer, who rode the area with his cattle, to mark it as a white woman&#x27;s grave so it would not be vandalized. Eventually, a fence was built around it and rocks placed over it to protect it from livestock. After the death of his wife, Williams went to the Puget Sound area and operated a ferry at Nisqually River and eventually moved to California where his brother owned a stage line. Today, the grave is located off Road 3120 on land owned by the Washington Department of Natural Resources in a small fenced area across a meadow from the springs.

The Thorp-Splawn Pioneer Cemetery is located about a mile southwest of the town of Thorp on the north side of Interstate 90 in a field that is visible from the freeway. The Thorp-Splawn Cemetery was neglected until 1964, when the Terra Firma Garden Club of Thorp restored the plot. However, putting the markers over the right graves was impossible due to years of decay and it is uncertain whether the markers correctly correspond with the individuals buried there.

Other early settlers in the Thorp area were Herman Page, J. H. Stevens, W. D. Killmore, A. T. Mason, George O’Hare, George and Jacob Forgey, John Newman, and John C. Goodwin. Goodwin was later appointed the first sheriff of Kittitas County upon the first meeting of the county commissioners in Ellensburg on December 17, 1883. John Ellison and Amy Childs of Thorp were both members of early settler families in the area, and at the time of their marriage in 1884, received the first marriage license granted in Kittitas County.
In the 1870s, the area that would become Thorp was known as Pleasant Grove and was part of Yakima County. On July 6, 1872, the Pleasant Grove post office on the west side of the Yakima River was established at the ranch of John S. Vaughn, and the Taneum post office was discontinued the following year on April 7 due to an unnecessary overlap in service. Despite being one of the earliest locations in Kittitas County to be settled, Pleasant Grove would remain sparsely populated for the next decade, with cattle ranching as the primary occupation.

By the early 1880s, farming was beginning to take hold in the area around Thorp, and the open range began to shrink. In 1880, the Pleasant Grove post office was moved close to where the small commercial center was beginning to form with the establishment of a sawmill and, three years later, a gristmill. The new settlement hoped for the eventual establishment of a railway depot as the Northern Pacific Railroad had made its intentions clear that it would soon come through the valley close to where the village was located.

===Mill town and railroad era===
In 1878, James L. Mills traversed the trail over the Cascade Mountains from Puget Sound by foot, and saw great possibilities in the Kittitas Valley. He built a sawmill west of the current town site in 1879, diverting water from the Yakima River to turn its wheels. The sawmill had a capacity of 7,000 feet daily.

Not content with the sawmill, Mills devised a way for the same wheels to power the North Star Mill, a gristmill that Oren Hutchinson had built at the town of Thorp in 1883, to provide feed for livestock and flour for the local residents. The mill was best known for its leading brand &quot;Tip Top&quot;.

The Pleasant Grove post office was moved in 1880 to a site near the mills and changed its name to Milton post office to reflect the name of the small settlement that had sprung up at that location, which was named for Milton Young. It was housed in several farm houses northwest of the current town site of Thorp until 1884, when it was re-established at the Thorp gristmill through the instrumentality of James L. Mills, who named it &quot;Oren&quot; after Oren Hutchinson. In 1889, the name of the post office was changed to &quot;Thorp&quot; to conform with the name used for the settlement by the Northern Pacific Railroad, and, in 1895, the post office was moved just down the road to the location of the depot that was built there and the town site that had been platted around it.

It was the system of water delivery that made the mills at Thorp possible, and the farming lands around Thorp are the oldest irrigated section in Kittitas County. The Manastash Canal was completed in 1875, followed later in the same year by the Taneum Ditch Company. The Westside irrigating canal that runs just south of the town of Thorp was begun in June 1889, and water was first used in 1890. Utilizing water diverted from the Yakima River, it is about 14 miles long and averages 12 feet wide. The original cost for building the Westside Canal was $30,000.

To a great extent, the town of Thorp owes its existence to the arrival of the Northern Pacific Railroad. While some of the initial settlement was undoubtedly influenced by the convergence of wagon trails which would eventually cross Snoqualmie Pass, it was the location of the Cascade spur that ultimately determined the location of the town. In 1887, the Northern Pacific Railroad reached the town of Thorp, when the railroad’s management built a sidetrack out one mile west of the current town site and named it after the intrepid pioneer F. M. Thorp and his family.

It took two years to build the Northern Pacific line from Old Town, now Union Gap, to Thorp. Chinese laborers or &quot;coolies&quot; were brought in first to build the Northern Pacific spur, and again to extend the Milwaukee Road through the Kittitas Valley. A Northern Pacific section house was located at Thorp where men of the regular crew boarded, while Chinese laborers and other members of the work gang had their own sleeping cars.
In 1895, with the extension of the main line to the site of the current town, the railroad station was moved and the town was laid out. The town of Thorp developed around this depot, with the first developments including the construction of maintenance facilities, shipping facilities and warehouses.

The current town site was settled by the Newman family in 1878. On July 9, 1895, a three-block town site was platted around the site of the Northern Pacific depot by John M. and Sarah Isabel Newman. In May 1900, Milford A. Thorp, a son of F. M. Thorp, added Thorp&#x27;s Addition, incorporating into the town site the land he had purchased in 1885 from James McMurray. Houses and businesses quickly sprang up, and small farms appeared around the edges.

The first store in Thorp was opened by J. E. Veach in about 1895. The first hotel was the Thorp House, established by A. St. John in 1893. The hotel was superseded by the Tanum House in 1903, which was built and operated by J. F. Duncan.

The &quot;Ellensburg Dawn&quot; newspaper wrote in the spring of 1901 of the promising little town:

&quot;The little village of Thorp, nine miles up the road, is one of the nicest little places in Central Washington. It is quiet, no saloons to mar the pleasure of the inhabitants, has a good church, a good public school building, a sawmill and a good flouring mill, both of which are operated by water power, a manufacturing establishment--land roller and box factory, and in fact you can get about all the accommodations in Thorp you can get in many towns of much larger population. We are glad Thorp is in Kittitas County.&quot;

In 1907, the energy from the water wheel at the North Star Mill was utilized to power a steam generator having a 40-horsepower dynamo, which furnished electricity for laundering clothes two mornings each week, and for lighting homes for a few hours each evening. This gave Thorp the distinction of being among the first towns in Washington to have electricity, and the smallest unincorporated town in the Northwest to have electric lights.

The addition of a Milwaukee Road depot in 1909 meant that Thorp was the first rail stop where the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pacific Railroad and the Northern Pacific Railroad crossed paths, making it an important shipping point at one time. The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pacific Railroad operated its headquarters for building operations in the Lower Kittitas County, including the shipping in of supplies for the area, out of its Thorp depot. The pay office of employees and the commissary were also located at Thorp.

The U.S. Postal Service carried mail to and from Thorp by railroad cars of the Northern Pacific. Rather than stopping and losing precious time, RPO (railway post office) cars featured a large hook that would catch the mailbag in its crook on the way past the station. A daily passenger train ran east to Ellensburg and points beyond, stopping in Thorp around 11:30 a.m. and returning around 4 p.m., followed by another westbound train at 11 p.m.


===Boomtown and beyond===
Through the first few decades of the 20th century, the town&#x27;s economy remained steady with the population reaching its peak at around 400 people. Eugene B. Brain wrote of the flourishing town of Thorp, as it was poised to enter into its boomtown era, in &quot;The Coast&quot; magazine:

&quot;The people of Thorp are prosperous and well-to-do. The business interests are represented by two general stores, a fine hotel, drug store, restaurant, livery, meat market, blacksmith shop, saw mill, flouring mill, numerous fruit packers and shippers and other pursuits [...] with a bright present, a prosperous and large future lies before the town. Thorp is bound to grow and with its enterprising and progressive residents a magnificent town is assured--a town of wealth and importance for Kittitas County.&quot;

Then in the late 1920s and 1930s, Thorp experienced a remarkable economic boost despite the Great Depression that had descended upon the nation.

This period of growth and prosperity was led by an influx of timber workers from the Taneum Canyon, where the Cascade Logging Company maintained a portable logging camp. In 1928, Thorp became one of the headquarters for the Bureau of Reclamation&#x27;s Kittitas Division of the Yakima Project which focused on construction of the Highline Canal, an event that brought yet more activity to the town.

This coincided with the establishment of Camp Taneum as Company 4771 of the Civilian Conservation Corps at nearby Taneum Canyon, bringing as many as 189 young men from as far away as New York to work at the camp, many of whom frequented the town of Thorp for shopping and entertainment. Camp Taneum was disbanded in July 1938, and its enrollees transferred to Fort Snelling, Minnesota, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and Little Rock, Arkansas for reassignment.

The boost in the economy brought workers into the town, spawning the need for social venues which, with the absence of liquor during the Prohibition era, made Ellison&#x27;s Hall a great attraction. Located at the corner of Railroad Street (Thorp Highway) and First Street, Ellison&#x27;s offered lively smokers on Saturday nights. It was also the home of many parties hosted by the Ladies&#x27; Aid Society, and dances featuring local favorites like &quot;Larry&#x27;s Harmony Aces&quot; and &quot;Pinky&#x27;s Roamers&quot;.

On the morning of May 24, 1938, a serious fire burned several small businesses to the ground, including the Thorp Hotel, and a mercantile along with the clubhouse on the second floor above it which was home to the Thorp Odd Fellows and Rebekahs lodges.

The Thorp Hotel had been operated as the &quot;Tanum House&quot; first by J. F. Duncan and then by Frank and Callie Mattox. The name was changed sometime in the 1920s, and subsequently operated by Harrison and Nancy Barrett from 1924 to 1930. At the time of the fire it was operated by Ray Long.

None of the businesses destroyed in the 1938 fire were rebuilt, and the business district of the town was again struck by fire on the afternoon of August 16, 1943, when another commercial building was burned. The blaze threatened a serious conflagration, and was extinguished by state forestry crews with the assistance of a pumper from Ellensburg.

The realization that the fire might have been more serious, coupled with the previous fires in the town, gave impetus to a movement that had been underway at Thorp for some time regarding the purchase of fire equipment. An emergency meeting of the town residents was held on the evening of August 19, 1943, to discuss the town&#x27;s response to the problem. Kittitas County Fire District No. 1 was organized in that same year at Thorp, and is the oldest fire protection district in the state. The volunteer fire department&#x27;s small fire house was topped with the large bell that originally hung in the belfry of the old Thorp school house. The bell is now an artifact at the current fire station which was recently built adjacent to the old one. The original fire house was subsequently sold and has been converted to an artist&#x27;s studio and residence.

The boomtown days began to subside with the departure of the canal workers and the winding down of nearby logging operations. The local economy greatly suffered with many businesses closing never to reopen, and the boom era had essentially come to a close by the end of World War II.

The Northern Pacific Railroad depot at Thorp was officially closed on July 1, 1952. The Northern Pacific cited a steady decline in shipments and competition from trucks as the reason for the closure. The last shipment of freight moved from Thorp via the Northern Pacific line was on May 9, 1952.

In 1967, ground was broken at the site of the 1938 fire by the Ellensburg Telephone Company which acquired the land to build a local telephone exchange office for the Thorp area. The building, which cost $25,000 to complete, was cut into service in May 1968, and is still in use. The exchange office was originally equipped to handle 400 subscribers.

The construction of a two-lane steel truss bridge over the Yakima River west of Thorp in 1936, prepared the way for the designation of the Thorp Highway, from State Route 10 (SR 10) to US 97, as SSH 3M (Secondary State Highway 3M) in 1937. In 1953, the highway through Thorp was deleted from the state highway system.

The location of U.S. Route 10 (now State Route 10) north of Thorp in 1926, and the eventual opening of Interstate 90 in 1968, all played vital roles in the changing population and economic conditions that shaped the small community.

In 1980, Interstate 90 from Seattle to Thorp was designated the &quot;Mountains to Sound Greenway&quot; to protect its outstanding scenic and cultural resources.

===Thorp Cemetery===
The Thorp Cemetery is located about a mile south of the town along Thorp Cemetery Road. Herman Page, a farmer who came to Thorp from New York, gave land for the cemetery and he is buried there. Markers denote graves dated as early as 1890, however Herman Page started Page&#x27;s Grove, a 10-acre timber culture, and claimed his 160-acre homestead as early as 1875.

The title was transferred to the Thorp Methodist Episcopal Church in the late 1880s, and it was subsequently operated by the Thorp Odd Fellows Lodge until 1940 when the lodge folded. In 1962, it was placed under the management of Kittitas County Cemetery District No. 1.

Local legend holds that the cemetery is haunted by the ghost of a young Indian woman by the name of Susie, who was tragically lynched around the year 1890 at Thorp, by persons unknown in the area. Documents held by the Kittitas County Genealogical Society confirm her death as &quot;caused by hanging by unknown person,&quot; listing her father as Salmon La Sac. It is reported that she has been seen riding a white horse, and weeping sorrowfully among the tombstones on moonlit nights. The cemetery is often listed among &quot;haunted places&quot; in Washington state.

The cemetery is restful and well cared for, and remains an active place of burial for departed loved ones of the Thorp community. Visitors, especially those fascinated by the legend of the Indian girl and her ghost, are encouraged to show respect for those resting there, and for the rights and privacy of visiting families.

===Churches===
Several Thorp families that came from Polk County, Oregon, had a heritage in the Stone-Campbell Movement. Although they had been meeting as a group since 1890, the Thorp Church of Christ was not formed until 1895. The primary movers in launching the new congregation were Mary Childs and Sarah Goodwin. Their work was successful, but Sarah Goodwin is not listed on the charter roll of 1895 because she had already passed to her eternal reward by the time the church was fully established.

The first services were held at the Thorp school house, with a permanent church structure being erected in 1897. Early ministers signed one-year contracts to serve the community with most moving on to other congregations after only a short period of time.

The town of Thorp was also the home of the Thorp Methodist Episcopal Church for many years, however that congregation was disbanded sometime in the 1930s. The steeple on the Methodist Episcopal church was cut off, and it served variously as a Grange hall, clubhouse and the Rodeo Renegades square dance hall.

In 1949, Teddy Leavitt formed a short-lived Bible college at Thorp, which was affiliated with the Thorp Church of Christ. The church structure fell victim to fire on April 13, 1950, and as a result the college was relocated to Selah, Washington, where it continued as the Central Washington Bible College until 1977. After the 1950 blaze, the Thorp Church of Christ was quickly rebuilt in the same location.

The Thorp Church of Christ became the Thorp Community Church in 1981. It is located near the intersection of Goodwin Road and First Street in Thorp, and continues to minister to the spiritual needs of the townspeople.

==Transportation==
Reachable via Exit 101 (Thorp, Thorp Highway) on Interstate 90, Thorp can also be accessed from State Route 10 (formerly U.S. Route 10) via the Thorp Highway at milepost 8.98.

The main line of the Northern Pacific Railroad used to run through the town of Thorp, and it was considered an important shipping point at one time. Currently the Burlington Northern-Santa Fe uses the rail line through the town, but the train no longer makes stops.

==Education==


Public schools are operated by Thorp School District No. 400. The district includes one junior/senior high school (Thorp High School), and one elementary school.

==Points of interest==
* Thorp Community Day -- Thorp Community Day is an annual celebration taking place in early October, coinciding with the autumn harvest. The event begins with a pancake breakfast at the Thorp Fire Station, and a parade through the town. It culminates with various community-oriented activities including the Fall Market at the Thorp Tractor Company, which generally attracts local vendors featuring anything from handcrafted furniture, clothing, jewelry, art, antiques and fresh local produce. The Harvest Carnival, held at the historic Thorp Grade School building, offers old-fashioned games such as apple bobbing, the ring toss and pumpkin bowling. Proceeds from carnival ticket sales go to support student activities at Thorp High School. An open house at the historic Thorp Mill is also a highlight of the celebration, which also includes live entertainment from local musicians.
* Iron Horse State Park - Part of the Washington State Park System, Iron Horse State Park follows the path of the now defunct Milwaukee Road between the Cascade Mountains and Yakima River Valley, between Cedar Falls on the west and the Columbia River on the east. Access is on Thorp Depot Road near Interstate 90 exit 101 at Thorp.
* The Thorp Mill - One of Kittitas County&#x27;s oldest landmarks, the historic grist mill is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and offers a unique perspective on the history of Thorp and the surrounding area.
* Thorp Grade School - Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the building was erected in 1936 and continues to serve the educational needs of the children of the town of Thorp. During hours of operation, visitors can check in at the district administrative offices in the modern building next door. A look inside the old school house reveals finely crafted hardwood floors, intact mouldings and a wood paneled gymnasium.
* Northern Pacific Depot - The Northern Pacific train depot was originally located adjacent to the railroad tracks near the corner of Thorp Highway and Second Streets. It was subsequently moved to its current location along Thorp Highway near the east entrance to the town.
* Old Thorp Fire Station - Fire District No. 1 was established in 1943, and is the oldest fire protection district in the state. The old fire station is located near the corner of Main Street and Thorp Highway adjacent to the new fire station. The building was recently sold and converted to a residence.
* Old Thorp Post Office - Located near the corner of Main Street on the Thorp Highway, closeby the old fire station, the old Thorp Post Office operated until the 1990s when a new structure was built a few blocks away. The old post office is now an artist studio called Thorp Collective.
* F. C. Porter Store - A start-of-the-20th century dry goods store on the corner of Thorp Highway and Second Streets, this building now houses a printing business. One of the oldest surviving commercial structures in the area, it originally opened around 1895 as J. E. Veach Dry Goods and was the first store established at Thorp. It was subsequently acquired by the Porter family, who expanded the building around 1912 to include integrated living quarters in the back, which was common in small-town businesses of the era. It is a classic example of late 19th-century false-front commercial wood-frame architecture.

<text>Vantage is a census-designated place (CDP) in Kittitas County, Washington, United States. The population was 74 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The area around Vantage has been occupied by the Wanapum Native Americans since prehistory. A number of well-preserved rock-paintings have been found on the cliff walls. They also used the abundant petrified wood in the area for arrowheads and other tools. The site where these petroglyphs were found was inundated by the rising waters behind Wanapum Dam in the 1960s. About 60 of the more than 300 carvings were cut from the basalt cliff face and saved. The nearby Ginkgo Petrified Forest site is one of the most unusual fossil forests in the world, and was designated a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service in 1965.

In the early part of the 20th century, residents in nearby Ellensburg needed a more direct route when traveling east. A small ferry was established in 1914 to carry vehicle traffic across the Columbia River at Vantage. This ferry was really just a small barge with wooden ramps at either end, it carried only two cars at a time across the river. After several cars (some with occupants still in them) were lost overboard, the state highway department decided to construct a bridge over the Columbia.

In 1927, the bridge was opened at Vantage. This was an important link in the Sunset Highway, the major east–west thoroughfare in Washington at the time (later U.S. Route 10, now Interstate 90). The construction of the bridge required workers to enter pressurized caissons under the riverbed via airlocks. Some workers became seriously ill from the effects of the pressure. Once completed, the bridge had a clearance on the center span, allowing for river traffic to pass under the bridge.

This cantilever bridge served at Vantage for 35 years, succeeded by the current bridge in 1962. The original was dismantled and moved to the crossing at Lyons Ferry, where it stands today as the oldest ( years) extant steel cantilever bridge in Washington, and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

With completion of the Wanapum Dam in the early 1960s, the townsite was relocated further up the hill above the rising water to the current location.

== Geography ==
Vantage is located along the Columbia River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land.

The original town of Vantage was flooded by the Columbia River when the Wanapum Dam was placed into operation.

==Business and recreation==

=== Business ===
There are several gas stations, two restaurants, and a private RV park/campground in Vantage. The Wild Horse Wind Farm, owned by Puget Sound Energy, is located on ridge tops near Vantage.

=== Recreation ===
Vantage is known for Ginkgo Petrified Forest State Park and its associated Wanapum Recreational Area, as a base camp for those attending nearby Gorge Amphitheatre, and its rock climbing.

Rock climbing is one of the area&#x27;s more popular forms of outdoor recreation and mostly takes place in &quot;Echo Basin&quot; (often mistaken for &quot;Frenchman Coulee&quot; which is the basin just north of Echo, on the other side of the Old Vantage Highway) on the basalt columns typical to the desert rimrock in the area.

Climbers started visiting as early as the 1950s and 1960s but the area was not popularized and publicized until the 1980s. With this came a great increase in route development. Today the area holds over 400 established routes (both traditionally protected and bolted) ranging in difficulty from 5.0-5.13c, and sees visitors almost year-round.

In 1879, the town was named after Bickle. The town&#x27;s economy was initially based largely on cattle ranching and wheat farming. A series of fires in 1937 and 1947 destroyed many of the town&#x27;s original buildings.

The oldest surviving building in Bickleton is the Bluebird Inn, a tavern which first opened in 1882. It is billed as the oldest functioning tavern in the state, although it has changed ownership numerous times and operated under different names throughout its history. The tavern includes a 1903 Brunswick pool table, which is still used by regulars.

The town has held an annual picnic and rodeo continuously since 1910. The festival also features a 1905 Herschell-Spillman carousel, which the town purchased from Oaks Amusement Park in Portland, Oregon, in 1928.

===Bluebirds===
Bickleton is known as the bluebird capital of the world. In the 1960s, Jess and Elva Brinkerhoff were picnicking in this small town after coming from nearby Richland and put a can in a tree for some birds. It became a local fad, and now there are thousands of birdhouses purposely built to house bluebirds.

Both the mountain bluebird and the western bluebird nest in Bickleton. Maintaining the houses by cleaning old nests is a major task for the local residents. It is funded by profits from bluebird souvenirs sold to tourists at Whitmore&#x27;s Whoop-n-Holler Ranch Museum.

The loss of their traditional fishing grounds at Celilo Falls during the construction of The Dalles Dam in March 1957 dealt both a spiritual and an economic blow to the tribe.

Originally called &quot;Rockport&quot; or &quot;Rockland Flats&quot;, Dallesport was the site of the first ferry crossing in the area, beginning in 1854. Rockland Flats was the original seat of Clickitat County (the name of the county was spelled with a &quot;C&quot; until an official name change in 1869), and remained so until 1878. Riverboat traffic moved up and down the river, but could not pass the falls at the Dalles and Celilo Falls. Portage was originally via a wagon road circumventing the falls. The Oregon Portage Railroad allowed passage of goods and travelers by rail beginning in 1863, but shippers chafed at the monopoly. In 1905, Congress approved an canal with locks on the north shore to bypass the falls. The Dalles-Celilo Canal opened May 5, 1915. The canal incorporated five locks with a total lift. The canal remained in use until it was flooded by the Dalles Dam in 1957.

The idea of a bridge crossing at this location was broached beginning in the late 19th century, but was not approved until 1947. The Dalles Bridge remained unbuilt until Congress approved the Dalles Dam in 1951. The bridge was opened December 18, 1953.

<text>Goldendale is a city and county seat of Klickitat County, Washington, United States, near the Columbia River Gorge. The population within city limits was 3,760 at the 2000 census and 3,407 at the 2010 census, a 9.4% decrease. It is situated in a primarily agricultural area and is also near Goldendale Observatory State Park. The valley in which Goldendale is located offers views of the Cascade Mountains to the west and the Simcoe Mountains to the north.

==History==

In 1859 the town was given its name by the early homesteader John Golden, a Pennsylvania-born farmer who settled with his wife from Oregon. His daughter&#x27;s home at Columbus Street and Collins Street remains standing in downtown Goldendale. The town was designated as the county seat of Klickitat County in 1878. Goldendale was officially incorporated on November 14, 1879. Much of the young town, including the county courthouse, was destroyed in a devastating fire on May 13, 1888.

On June 9, 1918, William Wallace Campbell, director of the Lick Observatory, and astronomer Heber Curtis journeyed to Goldendale to view a total solar eclipse. The purpose of the observation was to photograph the Sun&#x27;s corona and the apparent distorted placement of stars due to the Sun&#x27;s gravitational pull on those star&#x27;s rays while passing by the Sun. Lacking proper equipment and instead only using multiple cameras Campbell and Curtis were unable to confirm stars&#x27; deflection. However, by November 1919, their efforts would be vindicated by British astronomers and Einstein&#x27;s Theory of Relativity was confirmed. Goldendale was also under the path of totality for another total eclipse on February 26, 1979, which drew thousands of visitors to the Goldendale Observatory.

In 2008 Goldendale hosted the International Gravity Sports Association&#x27;s &#x27;Festival of Speed,&#x27; on a segment of the historic Maryhill highway.

Goldendale has remained the employment, business, commercial and banking center for the valley and, as the county seat, is the location for Klickitat County&#x27;s courts and government offices. In recent years this small community has suffered from severe economic decline. After a local aluminum plant that once employed many residents closed, the small community struggled economically. The loss of tax base has taken its toll on the funds available for maintaining the city&#x27;s infrastructure. In recent years there has been an interest in installing wind turbines that would generate power. While it has provided some jobs, this industry has not been the economic solution for which many residents hoped.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

Goldendale&#x27;s elevation at the County Courthouse is .

The Little Klickitat River flows roughly east-to-west across the northern portion of the city. Bloodgood Creek, an entirely spring-fed year-round water source, runs through the northwest part of town and intersects with the Little Klickitat just west of the city. Both are sources of rainbow trout as well as being home to waterfowl such as the great blue heron and several species of duck. Bloodgood Creek provides a portion of Goldendale&#x27;s drinking water and is capped at the source for that purpose.

U.S. Route 97 runs along the eastern boundary of the city and connects Goldendale with Interstate 84, south in the state of Oregon and State Route 14, which is south and runs along the Washington side of the Columbia River. State Route 142 creates a major east–west route through Goldendale, beginning at US 97 on the north end of town.

==Climate==
Goldendale has a continental Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Dsb&quot;). The rain shadow of the Cascades creates distinct and visible difference between the arid and dry areas south of the community, and the more lush treed areas to the north. This produces a landscape of open bunch-grass prairies dotted with sagebrush and rabbit brush containing the occasional juniper tree, while the more sheltered areas consist of ponderosa pine and oak savannahs.

Overcast days are rare, occurring mostly in late fall and throughout winter. Summer temperatures can reach well over , while winter, when most of the annual precipitation of around occurs, can see temperatures below , particularly in January. Summer thunderstorms occur intermittently, particularly in July and August, but due to high cloud bases, rain seldom reaches the ground in any appreciable amount. Lightning-caused range and forest fires are a common occurrence during this time of year. Spring flowers and green meadows and prairies make Goldendale a particularly beautiful site. Spring and summer can be very blustery since the Chinook winds off the Pacific Ocean are funneled through the Columbia Gorge. Fall tends to be almost windless, and the autumnal oak leaves add a lovely touch of golden rust red to Observatory Hill on the north side of town.

About 21.9% of families and 25.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 30.5% of those under age 18 and 26.3% of those age 65 or over.

==Industry==

A lumber mill and logging used to be major industries in the area but have since ceased to exist.

Timber cutting, ranching, farming, agriculture are still key industries in the area, but have seen some hard times over the years, an incidental effect to the modernization of farms and the ease of transporting products to ports on the Oregon Coast.

==Industrial plant==

A closed aluminum processing plant had a big economic impact for 35 years and continues to impact the area as pensioners still draw benefits from the decades of operations.

The John Day area aluminum reduction plant was built by Harvey Aluminum (later Martin Marietta, forerunner to conglomerate Lockheed Martin) at an industrial site adjacent to the John Day Dam in 1968. The industrial development and resulting jobs brought an era of growth and prosperity to Goldendale for 35 years, which brought the area new levels of prosperity from the high paying industrial jobs with significant benefits. This plant added payroll strength and diversity of the timber- and agricultural-based Goldendale area economy. Many area residents still enjoy pension and healthcare benefits from the 35 years of the industrial operations.

The aluminum facility with 3 shifts of employment at its peak in the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s was employing about 1,400–1,800 people and about 800 in the years from 1990 to 2003. The facility had been awarded a large allotment of low cost power from the hydro electric dam system that was nearby, with the assumption this would encourage industrial development and create jobs and resulting economic development. In 2003, the aluminum smelter closed operations. Reasons cited were high electricity costs and low world prices for aluminum. Many of the workers moved while others remained while they went back to school and retrained for other occupations. The closing of the aluminum plant caused serious economic stress in the area.

At this time Rabanco Regional Disposal is the largest single employer of residents in the Goldendale area.

==Culture==

Goldendale has many annual civic activities including the Klickitat County Fair &amp; Rodeo, the Goldendale Community Days, held on the Goldendale Courthouse lawn, and holiday parades.

Goldendale celebrated its fourth annual Pride celebration in 2023, led by the Goldendale Pride Alliance, a charitable foundation established by Andrew Halm.

===Tourism===
Goldendale&#x27;s tourist attractions include the Goldendale Observatory, the nearby Maryhill Museum with a collection of 87 works by Auguste Rodin &amp; a contemporary architectural construction by Portland-based firm Allied Works Architecture, and the Maryhill Stonehenge, a life-size cement replica of the original Stonehenge, situated ten minutes south of Goldendale. The replica, completed in 1930, is a memorial of those who died in World War I.

In downtown Goldendale, the Presby Mansion, now the Presby Museum, is also a tourist attraction featuring a newly restored 1898 Russel Steam Tractor and housing the Klickitat County Historical Society.

===Media===
The town has a weekly newspaper, the &quot;Goldendale Sentinel&quot;, which is published on Wednesdays and has a readership of approximately 3,200 subscribers across Klickitat County. It was established in 1879 as the &quot;Klickitat Sentinel&quot; and absorbed several rival newspapers in Goldendale and the county by the mid-1910s. The newspaper remains locally owned by its publisher.

== History ==
The site where the town is located was originally called &quot;Wrights&quot; after one of the original settlers. This was the name given to the rail stop there. The rail stop down the river at milepost 7.2 was named &quot;Klickitat&quot;, after the Klickitat people and the railroad later switched the two signs when the carbonated beverage company Klickitat Pop (operating near the town) gained fame. On February 7, 1910, the name of the town post office was officially changed to &quot;Klickitat&quot;.

The first non-native settlers arrived in 1890 seeking land to homestead. The abundance of timber drew in other settlers during the early 1900s. Travel through the Klickitat canyon and up to the plateau was arduous until the completion of a rail line in 1903.[4, p. 47] The rail line eased travel and facilitated the transportation of people, crops, livestock and timber. The lumber mill was the primary employer in town, with the first major mill formed 1909, until 1994 when the mill was permanently closed. The naturally carbonated Klickitat Mineral Springs just east of town gave rise to health spas, a carbonated beverage company, and a large dry ice plant which operated until 1957.

== Recreation ==
The area surrounding the town of Klickitat and the river which shares its name are renowned for their seasonal hunting and fishing. During summer, popular activities on the Klickitat River include recreational drift boating, kayaking, and rafting. Paths and trails provide opportunities for scenic hikes. The Klickitat Trail is on the route of the former railroad tracks, now a biking and hiking trail. The trail follows the Klickitat River north from the Columbia River past the town of Klickitat. Washington State Route 142 provides a scenic drive through the canyon. Two miles east of town is the ruins of the dry ice plant with a single remaining building. The site is now a public campsite.

<text>Lyle is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Klickitat County, Washington, United States. The population was 518 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

Established around 1859, the community was originally called &quot;Klickitat Landing&quot;. The first European settler was Egbert French, who arrived from Ohio. In 1866, French sold his holdings to James O. Lyle from The Dalles, Oregon, who moved to the north bank of the Columbia River.

A post office was soon established with Lyle as one of the first postmasters, and with mail delivered by steamer from the opposite shore. Steamboat operation lasted until the North Shore Railroad was completed. When the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway came to town in 1908, its line passed somewhat north of the town. The present townsite was plotted in 1909, and the older townsite became known as &quot;downtown&quot;. The nearest airport is 8.4 miles away in Dallesport, WA and was a grass strip in the early 1920&#x27;s, then The U.S. Corps of Engineers built the current airfield in 1942 as a World War II training facility.

==Lyle today==

Lyle has two main areas: that part which is built on the north bank of the Columbia River, including the downtown, and that part which is built on the hills above the river. The downtown area has one grocery store, two churches, a museum, a tavern, a restaurant/cafe, a gas station and vehicle repair shop, a second-hand store, an espresso stand, and a historic hotel with restaurant and bar.

Residential areas flank downtown and extend east and west. Newer residences have sprung up on the northern hill overlooking downtown, with row upon row of homes on terraces. Less than 30 years ago, there were fewer than half a dozen homes on the entire hill. Now there are dozens, all seemingly vying for the best view of the Columbia River.

Although Lyle is more than east of Portland/Vancouver, it is a bedroom community using freeway transportation on the Oregon side.

The Lyle Community Schools Campus includes three independent, small, rural schools: the area&#x27;s elementary, middle school and high school, which incorporate students from Dallesport and Murdock ( east of Lyle). The campus is located at the northernmost part of town, high on the hill overlooking Lyle.

== Geography ==
Lyle is located in southwestern Klickitat County on the north side of the Columbia River where it is joined by the Klickitat River. State Route 14 passes through the town, leading east to Dallesport and a junction with U.S. Route 197, and west to White Salmon. Dallesport and White Salmon are the locations of the closest road crossings of the Columbia River to the east and west, respectively. In addition, State Route 142 travels from Lyle to Goldendale along the Klickitat River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Lyle CDP has a total area of , all of it land. Behind the town, most of the land consists of hills leading to a large plateau that is commonly found in south-central Washington.

===Climate===
This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above . According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Lyle has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Maryhill is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Klickitat County, Washington, United States. The population was 55 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Maryhill is named after the wife and daughter of regional icon Sam Hill, who purchased land and envisioned a community there shortly after the turn of the 20th century. Earlier the area was known as &quot;Columbia&quot; or &quot;Columbus&quot;. In 1909, the Klickitat County commissioners had accepted the town&#x27;s name as &quot;Maryland&quot; - proposed by Sam Hill and Associates who had laid out the town. However, this name was rejected by postal authorities as they would not accept a name corresponding to a state, so it was renamed &quot;Maryhill&quot;.

Hill used his Maryhill property to build the first paved roads in the Pacific Northwest, the Maryhill Museum of Art (originally intended as a grand residence for the Hills), Maryhill Stonehenge, a monument to the World War I casualties of Klickitat County in the form of a Stonehenge replica, and a planned community. Born a Quaker, Hill hoped to attract a Quaker community to eastern Washington. His plans never materialized and the town buildings he constructed burned down several years later.

Hill intended the Stonehenge replica to express that modern warfare was a form of needless human sacrifice, referencing the contemporary belief that Stonehenge was a sacrificial site.

==Geography==
Maryhill is located along the southern edge of Klickitat County and the state of Washington at (45.685649, -120.817232). It sits on the north bank of the Columbia River, by river upstream from its mouth at Astoria, upstream from Portland, and upstream from The Dalles Dam.

U.S. Route 97 (US 97) crosses the Columbia at Maryhill via the Sam Hill Memorial Bridge. US 97 travels north towards Goldendale and south across the river to Wasco, Oregon. State Route 14 travels east–west through the area along the Columbia River, connecting Maryhill to White Salmon and Interstate 82 at Plymouth.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Maryhill CDP has a total area of , all land. The community is home to Maryhill State Park along the Columbia.

<doc id="138076" wikidata="Q1504223" url="?curid=138076" title="Wishram, Washington">
<text>Wishram is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Klickitat County, Washington, United States. The population was 366 at the 2020 census. The site of the historic Celilo Falls is nearby.

The community was originally named &quot;Fallbridge&quot;; it was changed to &quot;Wishram&quot; to honor the Wishram tribe of Native Americans. The Dalles Dam, downstream on the Columbia River, was completed in 1957, and began filling Lake Celilo. The original fishing village near this location was inundated.

==Geography==
Wishram is located in southern Klickitat County, sitting on the north bank of the Columbia River. State Route 14 runs east–west through the community, traveling west towards Vancouver and Dallesport and east towards Maryhill; it intersects with two U.S. highways that provide access to Oregon via bridges over the Columbia River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Wishram CDP has a total area of , all of it land.

==Geology==
Wishram&#x27;s location results from two major geological features: the location of the Celilo Falls on the Columbia River, and the access to the Central Oregon Plateau via the Deschutes River just across the falls from Wishram. The falls not only provided early peoples a reliable source of food, but it later provided a convenient location for an easily constructed railroad bridge crossing the Columbia. The Deschutes valley just to the south of the falls provided a route for rail access to the south, and ultimately to California.
Wishram lies toward the upper end of the Columbia River Gorge, which began forming as far back as the Miocene (roughly 12 - 17 million years ago), depositing thick layers of Columbia River Basalt, and continued to take shape through the Pleistocene (700,000 - 2 million years ago). During this period the Cascade Range was forming, slowly moving the Columbia River&#x27;s course north to its current location.

Although the river slowly eroded the land over this period of time, the most drastic changes took place at the end of the last ice age when the Missoula Floods cut the steep, dramatic walls that exist around Wishram today. During the flood, the water level rose to above the current level, violently eroding and exposing the layered basalt. This quick erosion left many layers of volcanic rock exposed.

==History==
The area of Wishram was located above the head of the great Celilo Falls on the Columbia, and as a result has been populated for an extended period. For around 15,000 years, native peoples gathered to fish and exchange goods. They built wooden platforms out over the water and caught salmon with dipnets and long spears on poles as the fish swam up through the rapids and jumped over the falls. Celilo Falls and The Dalles were strategically located at the border between Chinookan and Sahaptian-speaking peoples and served as the center of an extensive trading network across the Pacific Plateau. It was noted by early explorers and historians of the area.

In 1892 the U.S. government completed a set of locks to bypass Celilo Falls on the southern shore, across from Wishram. Built at a cost of $5,000,000, these locks saw limited service as much of the freight in and out of the Pacific Northwest began to travel by rail.

In 1912 the unincorporated town was known as &quot;Fallbridge&quot;, named in recognition of the southern extension of the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway, which crossed the Columbia on the Oregon Trunk Rail Bridge constructed on the basalt rock of Celilo Falls.

===Lewis and Clark===
Lewis and Clark mentioned the site of Wishram in their journal. In his journal for October 22, 1805, Clark recorded:
&quot;below this Island on the main Stard Shore is 16 Lodges of nativs; here we landed a fiew minits to Smoke, the lower point of one Island opposite which heads in the mouth of Towarnehiooks River (Deschutes River) which I did not observe until after passing these lodges about 1/2 a mile lower passed 6 more Lodges on the Same Side and 6 miles below the upper mouth of Towarnehiooks River the commencement of the pitch of the Great falls, opposite on the Stard. Side (Starboard or right side) is 17 Lodges [archaeologists have identified this as modern Wishram] of the nativs we landed and walked down accompanied by an old man to view the falls, and the best rout for to make a portage which we Soon discovered was much nearest on the Stard. Side, and the distance 1200 yards one third of the way on a rock, about 200 yards over a loose Sand collected in a hollar blown by the winds from the bottoms below which was disagreeable to pass, as it was Steep and loose. at the lower part of those rapids we arrived at 5 Large Lodges of nativs drying and prepareing fish for market, they gave us Philburts, and berries to eate, we returned droped down to the head of the rapids and took every article except the Canoes across the portag where I had formed a camp on ellegable Situation for the protection of our Stores from Thieft, which we were more fearfull of, than their arrows. we despatched two men to examine the river on the opposite Side, and reported that the Canoes could be taken down a narrow Chanel on the opposite Side after a Short portage at the head of the falls, at which place the Indians take over their Canoes. Indians assisted us over the portage with our heavy articles on their horses, the waters is divided into Several narrow chanels which pass through a hard black rock forming Islands of rocks at this Stage of the water, on those Islands of rocks as well as at and about their Lodges I observe great numbers of Stacks of pounded Salmon neetly preserved in the following manner, i e after Suffiently Dried it is pounded between two Stones fine, and put into a species of basket neetly made of grass and rushes of better than two feet long and one foot Diamiter, which basket is lined with the Skin of Salmon Stretched and dried for the purpose, in theis it is pressed down as hard as is possible, when full they Secure the open part with the fish Skins across which they fasten tho the loops of the basket that part very Securely, and then on a Dry Situation they Set those baskets the Corded part up, their common Custom is to Set 7 as close as they can Stand and 5 on the top of them, and secure them with mats which is raped around them and made fast with cords and Covered also with mats, those 12 baskets of from 90 to 100 w. each form a Stack. thus preserved those fish may be kept Sound and Sweet Several years, as those people inform me, Great quantities as they inform us are Sold to the whites people who visit the mouth of this river as well as to the nativs below.&quot;

By the time they returned on April 16, 1806, they reported the village had moved about 300 yards below the spot where it had been located the previous fall, and tended to move with the favored fishing locations.

===Early history===
The American author Washington Irving also mentioned the Native Americans resident at Wishram in his history of the Northwest titled &quot;Astoria or, Anecdotes of an Enterprise Beyond the Rocky Mountains&quot; and published in 1836. He stated:
&quot;For like reason we would make especial mention of the village of Wishram, at the head of the Long Narrows, as being a solitary instance of an aboriginal trading mart, or emporium. Here the salmon caught in the neighboring rapids were &#x27;warehoused,&#x27; to await customers. Hither the tribes from the mouth of the Columbia repaired with the fish of the sea-coast, the roots, berries, and especially the wappatoo, gathered in the lower parts of the river, together with goods and trinkets obtained from the ships which casually visit the coast. Hither also the tribes from the Rocky Mountains brought down horses, bear-grass, quamash, and other commodities of the interior. The merchant fishermen at the falls acted as middlemen or factors, and passed the objects of traffic, as it were, cross-handed; trading away part of the wares received from the mountain tribes to those of the rivers and plains, and vice versa: their packages of pounded salmon entered largely into the system of barter, and being carried off in opposite directions, found their way to the savage hunting camps far in the interior, and to the casual white traders who touched upon the coast.&quot;

Wishram is extensively mentioned in regional histories and travelogues of the early 19th century. Visitors included Thomas Farnham, Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company Governor Sir George Simpson, Alexander Ross, Father Pierre De Smet and Joseph Drayton&#x27;s party of the Wilkes Expedition, among others. Ross reported that at Wishram the summer encampments when the salmon were running could swell to 3,000 natives. Father De Smet described it as a glorious time of rejoicing, gambling and feasting.

There have been village sites at the Wishram location for millennia. Archeologists in the 1950s identified a multilevel site with centuries of waste accumulated in middens as well as petroglyphs and other indications of dense population. Most of the densely populated areas were close to the river and convenient to fishing. This lower area was flooded in 1957 by water backed up behind The Dalles Dam.
In 1926 a pioneer memorial was raised at Wishram/Fallbridge. Still located in its original position east of the passenger train station today, it consists of two columns of basalt bound together with iron straps and mounted on a pedestal. A bronze plaque recognizing various pioneers who have been to Wishram begins with Meriwether Lewis and ends with John C. Fremont. It originally marked the beginning of a path from that monument to Celilo Falls; that path is now covered by the backwaters from The Dalles Dam.

===Wishram/Fallbridge as a rail center===
The Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway was chartered in 1905 by James J. Hill for the purposes of connecting the two transcontinental railroads owned by him, the Northern Pacific and Great Northern, to Portland, Oregon from Spokane, Washington, in order to gain a portion of the lumber trade in Oregon, a business that at the time was dominated by E. H. Harriman&#x27;s Union Pacific and Southern Pacific railroads. Construction began in 1906 under the name Portland &amp; Seattle Railway, proceeding eastward from Vancouver, Washington. 1906 also saw the start of construction of the line between Vancouver and Portland. This railroad included the first bridge of any kind to be built across the lower Columbia River: the bridge now known as the BNSF Railway Bridge 9.6, in Vancouver.
Within a year, and despite legal challenges from Harriman, who wished to block its construction, the line had been built as far as Pasco, Washington, along the Columbia River, where there was a connection with Northern Pacific lines. The first section to open was from Pasco west through Wishram to cliffs (near Maryhill), a length of , on December 15, 1907. Operation was extended west to Lyle, for a total of , on January 15, 1908, as construction continued on the section from there to Vancouver.

The town of Wishram (then known as Fallbridge) was fortuitously situated at a location which made bridging the Columbia River relatively easy. It was possible to construct a bridge that had piers resting on normally exposed basalt rock above the waterfall during low water periods such that during periods of high water, when this stretch of the Columbia River became raging rapids, the piers supported a bridge spanning the entire flood. This bridge over Celilo Falls became known as the Oregon Trunk Rail Bridge or the fallbridge. The location of this bridge also allowed construction of rail through the Deschutes River canyon, allowing access to eastern Oregon&#x27;s high desert plateau and the eastern side of the Cascade Range.

As a result, the SP&amp;S was extended southward from Wishram toward Bend, Oregon. Hill and Harriman engaged in a head-to-head battle up the Deschutes grade, with intense competition for any advantageous routing. After the competition reached what has been described as ridiculous levels, Hariman died in 1909 and an agreement was reached that the extension was to be jointly operated with a Union Pacific subsidiary, the Oregon-Washington Railway &amp; Navigation. This southern extension relied upon the Oregon Trunk Rail Bridge – the &quot;fall bridge&quot; – constructed just downstream of Wishram at the waterfall on the Columbia. James J. Hill inaugurated this route, driving a golden spike in Bend in 1912. Fallbridge served as a passenger terminal, roundhouse and freight switch yard for traffic into Bend. Recognizing its central location, a 300-ton automatic coaling station was erected for the Spokane, Portland &amp; Seattle Railroad at Fallbridge in 1920.

The name was officially changed to &quot;Wishram&quot; in 1926. However, the name of Fallbridge continues to appear in various documents. In 1931 the official schedules for the railway used &quot;Wishram (Fallbridge)&quot; as the designation for the stop at Wishram. The town still appears as &quot;Fallbridge&quot; in 1940 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers port directories, and in 1941 in standard textbooks.

In 1931 the SP&amp;S line to Bend was connected via Klamath Falls, Oregon, to Bieber, California, providing a shortcut to connect with the Western Pacific Railroad in northern California.

<doc id="138077" wikidata="Q868700" url="?curid=138077" title="Centralia, Washington">
<text>Centralia () is a city in Lewis County, Washington, United States. It is located along Interstate 5 near the midpoint between Seattle and Portland, Oregon. The city had a population of 18,183 at the 2020 census. Centralia is twinned with Chehalis, located to the south near the confluence of the Chehalis and Newaukum rivers.

==History==
The area was first settled by the Upper Chehalis people with the first non-indigenous settlers arriving in 1845. In 1850, J. G. Cochran and his wife Anna were led there via the Oregon Trail by their adopted son, George Washington, a free African-American. The family feared Washington would be forced into slavery if they stayed in Missouri after the passage of the Compromise of 1850. Cochran filed a donation land claim near the Borst Home in 1852 and was able to sell his claim to Washington for $6,000 because unlike the neighboring Oregon Territory, there was no restriction against passing legal ownership of land to African Americans in the newly formed Washington Territory. The new community was connected to the Columbia and Puget Sound regions via the first major road in the area in 1857. In the 1850s and 1860s, Centralia&#x27;s Borst Home, at the confluence of the Chehalis and Skookumchuck Rivers, was the site of a toll ferry, and the halfway stopping point for stagecoaches operating between Kalama, Washington and Tacoma.

Upon hearing of the imminent arrival of the Northern Pacific Railway (NP) in 1872, Washington and his wife, Mary Jane, filed a plat for the town of Centerville, naming the streets with a Biblical theme, and offering lots for $10 each with one lot free to buyers who built houses. Washington also donated land for a city park, a cemetery, and a Baptist church. Responding to new settlers&#x27; concern about a town in Klickitat County with the same name, the town was renamed Centralia by 1883, as suggested by a recent settler from Centralia, Illinois, and officially incorporated on February 3, 1886. The town&#x27;s population boomed, then collapsed in the Panic of 1893, when the NP went bankrupt; entire city blocks were offered for as little as $50 with no takers. Washington (despite facing racial prejudice from some newcomers) made personal loans and forgave debt to keep the town afloat until the economy stabilized; the city then boomed again based on the coal, lumber and dairying industries. When Washington died in 1905, all businesses in the town closed, and 5,000 mourners attended his funeral. The city bestowed an honor to Washington in 2023 by declaring August 15, his recognized birthday, as Centralia&#x27;s Founder&#x27;s Day.

A large fire on June 26, 1908, part of a string of arson attempts spanning between the Twin Cities that month, decimated a block in the city&#x27;s downtown district. The early morning blaze, which began at the Star Saloon, caused the loss of twelve buildings but only one person was reported injured.

On November 11, 1919, the Centralia Massacre occurred. Spurred on by local lumber barons, American Legionnaires (many of whom had returned from WWI to find their jobs filled by pro-union members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW)), used the Armistice Day parade to attack the IWW hall. Marching unarmed, the Legionnaires broke from the parade and stormed the hall in an effort to bust union organizing efforts by what was seen to be a Bolshevik-inspired labor movement. IWW workers including recently returned WWI veteran Wesley Everest, stood their ground, engaged and killed four Legionnaires. Everest was captured, jailed and then brutally lynched. Other IWW members were also jailed. The event made international headlines, and coupled with similar actions in Everett, Washington and other lumber towns, stifled the American labor movement until the economic devastation of the 1930s Great Depression changed opinions about labor organizations.

The town&#x27;s name was originally a reference to the town&#x27;s location as the midway point between Tacoma and Kalama, which were originally the NP&#x27;s Washington termini. This central moniker continued to have longevity when it became the midpoint between Seattle and Portland, Oregon after the constructions of Interstate 5 and its predecessor, U.S. Route 99.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

===Landforms===
Located off Interstate 5 is Plummer Lake, a small body of water caused by the excavation of glacial rock for gravel purposes beginning in 1910. The lake is named after Sydney Plummer, owner of the quarry and excavating company at the time. , Plummer Lake is privately-owned.

===Climate===
This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 °F. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Centralia has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps. Temperatures are usually quite mild, although Centralia is generally warmer in the summer and colder in the winter than locations further north along the Puget Sound.

==Economy and employment==
Founded as a railroad town, Centralia&#x27;s economy was originally dependent on such industries as railroads and timber, as well as coal and agriculture. At one time, five railroad lines crossed in Centralia, including the Union Pacific Railroad, Northern Pacific Railway, Milwaukee Road, Great Northern Railroad and a short line.

The explosion of Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980, devastated the local lumber industry, as 12 million board feet of stockpiled lumber and 4 billion board feet of salable timber was damaged or destroyed. Unemployment surged to double digits, and the town lost most of its retail base.

In 1988, London Fog opened the first factory outlet store in the Northwest, choosing the location because it was the midpoint between major northwest cities. Their success spawned the region&#x27;s first factory outlet center, creating a tourist shopping destination. This led in turn to the redevelopment of the vintage downtown marketplace as an antique, art and specialty store destination.

The Port of Centralia, created in 1986 and located northwest of the city center near Fords Prairie, is a complex of industrial and mixed-use economic development in the municipality. Developed during the 1980s decline of the city&#x27;s dependable lumber-based economy, the port began constructing its base of operations in 1988 and the first tenant arrived in 1990. It won an award for port of the year in 1994 and became part of a foreign-trade zone in conjunction with other local counties in western Washington. The port expanded into a second phase in 2003. , the Port of Centralia is composed of a mix of three zones with 30 tenants that employed 800 people.

Chehalis Mints was founded in the city in 1994 and produces various mint and mint chocolate candies, with a specialty in butter mints. The company&#x27;s products are sold primarily in the Pacific Northwest.

As extractive industries faced decline, Centralia&#x27;s development refocused on freeway oriented food, lodging, retail and tourism, as well as regional shipping and warehousing facilities, leading to 60 percent growth in population since the 1980s. Additional development of regional distribution and transportation facilities, along with in-migration from retirees from more populated counties to the north, have helped diversify the economy, though unemployment remains stubbornly high and per-capita income well below the state average.

===TransAlta Coal Mine and Power Plant===
On November 28, 2006, it was announced that TransAlta, the largest employer in Centralia and operator of the Centralia Coal Mine and Centralia Power Plant, would eliminate over 550 coal mining jobs; the coal mine was the last operational mine in the state. The mine, which spread over , had been owned by TansAlsta since 2000. The company offered land donations to the city, as well as financial contributions to the local community to offset economic losses, in the wake of the closure. Despite fears that the city would suffer economically from the closure, there was little noticeable economic effect upon the City of Centralia as a result. Data indicated that Centralia was experiencing growth both in its light industrial areas as well as its core business district, the historic downtown Centralia. The mine has since undergone a reclamation to fill, regrade, dredge water sources, and plant new trees. , half of the reclamation project was considered complete. The site has been determined as a potential recreation area once the recovery processes are complete. During the mine&#x27;s opening, of coal were extracted and used at the plant.

The power plant, completed in two unit stages in the early 1970s and owned by TransAlta since 2000, is Washington state&#x27;s last energy factory powered by coal. At its peak, it generated energy ample enough to power Los Angeles. The plant is situated on and is expected to permanently close in 2025 based on an agreement reached with the state in 2011. The first phase of the shutdown was completed in 2020. The energy produced until its closure is used by Puget Sound Energy (PSE) and according to 2022 figures, 14.5% of PSE&#x27;s electric load came from the TransAlta coal plant, enough to supply power to 300,000 homes. Future plans include the operating of several green energy facilities, including generating power via hydrogen and fusion, and the decommissioning of the Centralia Coal Mine is expected to incorporate renewable energy machinery as the coal plant closes. 

During the closures, TransAlta created a $20 million fund for training and educational work programs for remaining employees of the plant. Part of a larger Centralia Coal Transition Grants initiative, other grants include millions for energy efficiency and technology for nearby communities and schools. The land at the site has slowly been reclaimed for public and commercial use, including the planting of trees and maintaining wetland areas.

==Arts and culture==

===Festivals and events===
Centralia has hosted the annual Hub City Car Show since the early 2000s. The one-day event, usually held in late summer, is held in the downtown district, shutting down the main artery through the historic center of the city.

The Centralia Campout is an annual, week-long gathering of folk musicians that takes place between the second and third weekends in August. The campout centers around American Old-time music, played in jam circles round the clock. Attendees engage in daily dances, workshops, and musical fellowship.

The Centralia Lighted Tractor Parade has been an annual winter holiday event since 2009. Hosted by the Centralia Downtown Association in early December, the parade begins at Centralia College and traverses through the core downtown district. The festival nominates a local resident, recognized for their contributions to the community, as a Grand marshal.

Girls Night Out is a bi-annual business and shopping event. Begun in 2008, the event supports the downtown economy while raising funds for local charities.

===Historic buildings and sites===

The Carnegie Library is located in Washington Park and was originally built in 1913 followed by a remodel in 1977–78. The library is now part of the Timberland Regional Library system.

Centralia Union Depot was built in 1912 and features red brick architecture, vintage oak benches, and internal and external woodworking throughout. The renovated depot, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is currently served by Amtrak.

Located in Fort Borst Park are the Fort Borst blockhouse and the Borst Home. The blockhouse is a log structure that was built in 1856 and was used as grain storage during local wars with Native Americans. Originally constructed near the confluence of the Chehalis and Skookumchuck rivers, the building was moved twice, in 1915 due to an alteration of the Chehalis River&#x27;s course, and then in 1922 to its present-day site in the park. Joseph Borst, an Oregon Trail migrant, purchased the blockhouse from the U.S. government in 1857 and his family would use the building as a residence until he built the Borst Home next to the structure in 1864. The house was constructed near a toll ferry crossing that existed at the time and the home site contains a replicated one-room schoolhouse and a church. The Borst Home, but not the blockhouse, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

Centralia is host to various other NRHP sites including the George E. Birge House, the Hubbard Bungalow, and the Wesley Everest Gravesite. The NRHP-listed Centralia Downtown Historic District is home to McMenamin&#x27;s Olympic Club Hotel &amp; Theater a registered historic hotel and restaurant that opened in 1908.

Additional buildings of note include the one-room Salzer Valley Schoolhouse. Situated southeast of the city on a donated land claim from the Salzer family, it was built in 1894 and existed as school until 1944.

====Movie Theaters====
The city was once home to the Twin City Drive-In, located immediately north of the Southwest Washington Fairgrounds. It began in 1933 as a single-screen outdoor theater, with a reopening in 1961 after a transfer of ownership. During the 1950s, the outdoor screens were known locally to show risque movies, such as Baby Doll and the nudist film, Garden of Eden. The drive-in had a train ride for children on the property; the ride was purchased by a local enthusiast and rebuilt for use at the 2015 fair. The premises installed a second screen but eventually the venue fell into disuse and the grounds left to decay. In 2002, a prior resident of Chehalis purchased the neon entrance sign to the drive-in with plans to display it as a highway memorial to graduates from the area; he would donate the sign later to an agriculture museum located in Centralia. Damages from windstorms decimated the screens and a fire in 2023, declared to be most likely arson, burned down the remaining building on the property, the ticket booth that also housed the projectors. , the theater grounds are mostly bereft of any immediately visible remnants and are covered in brush.

===Music===
Seattle-based rock band Harvey Danger used Centralia as a metaphor in its song &quot;Moral Centralia,&quot; found on the 2005 album &quot;Little by Little&quot;.

===Public art===
Murals are found throughout historic downtown Centralia. Examples include murals depicting the founder of Centralia (Centerville) named George Washington, Buffalo Bill and his Wild West Show and an abstract mural depicting the 1919 Armistice Day Centralia Massacre, also known as the Wobbly War.

Centralia is part of the ARTrails of Southwest Washington initiative. The cooperative, begun in 2003, showcases local artists, art studios and galleries throughout the region, and holds an annual autumnal studio tour that incorporates events in smaller towns within Lewis County. ARTrails opened a gallery for its members in the city in 2015 and the Centralia Train Depot is used as the nexus of the tour.

===Theater===
The city has been home to the Evergreen Playhouse since 1959. Beginning as a troupe performance at a ballroom of the local historic Lewis and Clark Building, it raised funds by selling $5 non-redeemable stock to patrons for its first production, &quot;Sabrina Fair&quot;. The organization eventually purchased its own theater in 1972 for $16,000. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the 130-seat playhouse underwent a renovation, including removing the original seating, but saved three of the original wood-backed chairs to be used in a display. , the Evergreen Playhouse, a non-profit, volunteer-run theater, has achieved to operate without a financial loss during its entirety, and has remained at the same location near the downtown district on Center Street.

==Sports==
Centralia once hosted a minor league baseball team in the early 20th century. The team moniker varied, going under the names of Midgets, Pets, and Railroaders. The ballclub won the 1911 Washington State League championship. Similar to the Chehalis teams, the Centralia team folded in 1912, and the city has not had an official minor league team since. The team played its home games at Riverside Park.

A bicycle event for local residents in the Twin Cities, known as the Centralia to Chehalis Bike Ride, was held continuously from the late 20th century into the 3rd millennium. The &quot;C to C&quot; route meandered from George Washington Park, to around the Chehalis–Centralia Airport, through residential neighborhoods, and finishing at the Recreation Park Complex in Chehalis.

==Parks and recreation==

The Centralia parks system is classified into distinct areas categorized as natural areas or open space corridors, neighborhood parks, or community parks. Recreational areas include sports related ballfields or water parks, and the city designates certain locations, such as buildings and other open spaces, as special facilities.

George Washington Park, in Centralia&#x27;s downtown district, is home to the Centralia Timberland Library. The park contains the statue, &quot;The Sentinel&quot;, and the Freedom Walk War Memorial, both honoring Centralia soldiers who lost their lives during World War I. The statue is also a remembrance to the deaths of American Legion members that occurred during the city&#x27;s 1919 Armistice Day Riot. It was placed in 1924 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A bronze plaque honoring the deaths of members of the IWW &quot;Wobblies&quot; during the Centralia Tragedy was installed next to the statue in 2023. The Freedom Walk was built in 1993 and presents the individual names of veterans who perished in military combat since the First World War.

A preserve encompassing over , known as the Seminary Hill Natural Area, was once the home of a seminary. The grounds contains over two miles of trails. 

Along the Skookumchuck River, near Hayes Lake in the shopping district, lies the Riverside Park. The land, originally developed by a local rotary club, was donated to the city in 1983. The park contains a skate park and a covered playground. The Fort Borst blockhouse was temporarily relocated to the site in the late 1910s.

A sports complex known as Bob Peters Field is situated at the Centralia College campus. Named after a long-serving athletic director at the school, the site hosts fields for baseball, softball, and soccer. It was completed in 2023 and was built, in part, by using over $3 million of student fees.

A community pool, known as the Veteran&#x27;s Memorial Pearl Street Pool, was built in the 1950s in Centralia&#x27;s downtown district, it once contained a bathhouse. The city owned and oversaw operations of the facility until the 1980s when it was transferred to a local nonprofit. Centralia would regain possession of the pool in 2008 but closed it in 2011 due to a combination of expensive repairs and maintenance, lack of funds, and a decrease in staffing. Since its 2011 cessation, various city and community groups have made improvements to the recreation parcel by adding a playground and spray park. Unable to cover approximately $5 million renovation and rebuild costs, the city council, in 2023, decided to permanently cease operations at the pool. The city would fill the pool with dirt, for liability and injury concerns, months later. A second community pool, known as the Centralia Community Pool, was created by a bond passed in the 1970s and is run under a joint contract between the city, the school district, and a local fitness company. Open to all residents, children and school activities are given priority at the facility.

===Fort Borst Park===
Centralia&#x27;s largest park is Fort Borst Park located at the junction of the Chehalis and Skookumchuck rivers. The park provides of paved trails in a forested setting. The site includes a dog park and a large picnic area. Visitors can fish from the river banks or access the waters via a boat launch, or at the park&#x27;s Borst Lake, which is stocked with rainbow trout.

The park contains the original Borst Home, a reproduced schoolhouse, and a replicated pioneer church from the 1860s that was completed in 2021. Surrounding the homestead is the Borst Park Arboretum, created in 1960. The arboretum contains the Borst family cemetery , almost 200 trees and a large number of rhododendrons. The park hosts an annual Christmas-themed &quot;Fort Borst Park Drive-Through Lights&quot; that includes a food drive and also raises funds for the park department.

Located within Fort Borst Park is Centralia&#x27;s NW Sports Hub. Officially opened in 2014, the complex is owned by a various group of Centralia government bodies and businesses. The hub contains enclosed buildings that house numerous volleyball and basketball courts and fields for indoor baseball and soccer. An attached outdoor component encompasses a mixture of previously built Little League and adult baseball fields, tennis courts, additional soccer fields, and the Centralia High School track stadium that can seat 3,500 people. In 2023, the outdoor fields received new lighting and turf, with special attention to Wheeler Field, based on funds from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The use of the complex is given first priority to the community over events held by private entities but the sports compound hosts various tournaments for high school sports, competitions for the Greater Seattle League, and planned college scouting events for local athletes.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

====Air====
Centralia is served by the Chehalis–Centralia Airport. The city, beginning in 1961, was once a co-owner of the airfield but withdrew from the joint operating agreement in 2004 due to concerns over contract violations, liability, and cost-benefits. Centralia was once home to the Centralia Municipal Air Field located near Fort Borst Park. Opened in August 1927 to 10,000 spectators and an aerial performance, the airport quietly folded by the mid-1930s reportedly due to hardships caused by the Great Depression.

====Railroads====
Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Centralia station, stopping at the town&#x27;s renovated 1912 railroad depot. Amtrak train 11, the southbound &quot;Coast Starlight&quot;, is scheduled to depart Centralia at 11:45am with service to Kelso-Longview, Portland, Sacramento, Emeryville, California (with bus connection to San Francisco), and Los Angeles. Amtrak train 14, the northbound Coast Starlight, is scheduled to depart Centralia at 5:57pm daily with service to Olympia-Lacey, Tacoma and Seattle. Amtrak &quot;Cascades&quot; trains, operating as far north as Vancouver, British Columbia and as far south as Eugene, Oregon, serve Centralia several times daily in both directions. BNSF trains in Centralia&#x27;s downtown rail yard and on the mainline serve local and regional shippers, but can affect the timeliness of Amtrak service and are a noisy reminder of the days of the town&#x27;s heyday as the crossroads of four major railroads (Union Pacific, Milwaukee Road, Great Northern and Northern Pacific).

===Utilities===

====Communications====
The first telephone operations in Centralia began in 1891 when the city was connected to the Sunset Telephone and Telegraph Company (STTC) located on Tower Avenue. The first customer was a neighboring pair of attorneys. The STTC recorded 23 subscribers the following year, falling to only six in 1893, but began to slowly rebound at the turn of the century. By 1910, over 500 customers subscribed to the line, serving approximately 1,000 customers in the Twin Cities when the STTC was renamed in 1916 as the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company . By the mid-1960s, the area was served by Pacific Northwest Bell and had a subscriber list of over 12,000 between Centralia and Chehalis.

====Water====
, Centralia Public Works was granted $85,000 to fund searches for lead pipes in the city, the only water utility in Washington state to accept monies from a $63 million federal bill passed in 2021 meant to help find and replace lead piping. In 2018, the city investigated the use of lead pipes in the municipal water system, specifically for homes built from the 1920s through the 1940s. The city has found only five pigtail connections made of lead since the late 1970s.

Centralia built a wastewater treatment facility beginning in 2001 that is located on in the Ford&#x27;s Prairie neighborhood near the Discovery Trail. Begun from a Washington Department of Ecology loan that eventually cost almost $27 million, the facility replaced an at-capacity treatment plant built in 1951 near Mellen Street. , the facility processes up to of wastewater per day.

<doc id="138078" wikidata="Q249441" url="?curid=138078" title="Chehalis, Washington">
<text>Chehalis ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Lewis County, Washington, United States. The population was 7,439 at the time of the 2020 census.

The city is located in the Chehalis valley and is split by Interstate 5 (I-5) and State Route 6. It is twinned with the bordering city of Centralia. The communities of Napavine and Newaukum lie directly south, with the town of Adna to the west. Due to the community&#x27;s location on the Chehalis River, and the nearby confluences of the Newaukum and Skookumchuck rivers, the city has experienced several historic flooding events during its history.

Incorporated in 1883, Chehalis was primarily a logging and railroad town, with a shift towards farming in the mid-20th century. The city has bolstered its economy in the 21st century with a focus in manufacturing and warehousing.

Chehalis is home to the historic neighborhood of Claquato, the Chehalis–Centralia Airport, and the Southwest Washington Fairgrounds. The city has several distinct historical areas and boasts 11 locations on the list of National Register of Historic Places, more than any other region in Lewis County. Several museums that highlight motorcycles, veterans and military history, and the Chehalis history of railroads are located within the city limits. Chehalis contains approximately of parks, most begun by land donations and are overseen by volunteer community efforts. The community is known locally for its annual summer event, ChehalisFest.

The city anchors the beginning trailhead for the Willapa Hills Trail and accommodates riders during the Seattle to Portland Bicycle Classic. Chehalis once was home to a championship minor league baseball team and often welcomed barnstorming ballclubs and competitions featuring teams from Negro league baseball.

In the 21st century, Chehalis initiated several charity, volunteer, and local government sponsored groups to revitalize the city, with focus on renovations to its historic downtown district, the upgrading of the community&#x27;s transit sector, and increasing the education and graduation rate within the school district. Additional efforts of improvements were led via art programs and renovations to its parks.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Chehalis&quot; is derived from , the name of principal village of the Lower Chehalis people, located near what is now Westport, Washington. It translates to &quot;place of sand&quot; or &quot;shifting sand&quot; in English. It has also been spelled Atchixe-lish, Chachelis, Checalish, Chehaylis, Chickeelas, Chixeelis, Ebihalis, Tcheles, Tsehalish, and Tse-he-lis. Early non-native explorers of the Pacific Northwest vocalized the words as &quot;Chehalis&quot; and proceeded to describe the original inhabitants as such.

The community was originally known as Saunder&#x27;s Bottom and as the town of Saundersville, named after Schuyler and Eliza Saunders on whose donation land claim it was founded when they settled on the land in 1850. Differing timelines and recognition of the name change to Chehalis exist. A founding member of the community and its postmaster, Obadiah B. McFadden, renamed the town as Chehalis in 1870. Another account claims officials for the Northern Pacific Railroad, in 1874, began to refer to the location as Chehalis but for unknown reasons. The naming was officially recognized by the state legislature on September 23, 1879. The Chehalis nomenclature is believed to denote its location to the Chehalis people and the Chehalis River.

The meaning of the names of Saunder&#x27;s Bottom and Chehalis were fitting for the growing town due to the muddy bottomland along the Chehalis River which had long vexed stagecoach travelers on the Washington arm of the Oregon Trail between Kalama and New Market (Tumwater). 

===Motto and nickname===
As red roses had long been a symbol of the community, including the All-America Rose Selections (AARS) accredited Chehalis Municipal Rose Garden, the city adopted the red rose as an official community flower in 1955, leading to the nickname for Chehalis, &quot;The Rose City&quot;, which was made official in 2000. The city&#x27;s motto, &quot;A Heritage to be Proud Of&quot; was concurrently adopted. The community has been informally known as &quot;The Mint City&quot; due to I.P. Callison&#x27;s mint plant and as &quot;The Friendly City&quot;, nomenclature born from social symbolism connected to roses. An attempt to change the official moniker to &quot;The Friendly City&quot; in 2009 did not pass, but the city changed its motto to &quot;Where Heart and History Shape Our Future&quot;.

==History==
Chehalis began as a settlement around a warehouse beside a railroad track in 1873, when the Northern Pacific Railroad built northward from Kalama to Tacoma. Northern Pacific&#x27;s decision bypassed the town of Claquato, then the county seat. This allowed Chehalis, in 1874, to become the central location for Lewis County government. That same year, a store was added to the warehouse, and a courthouse and several houses were constructed. Chehalis was incorporated on November 23, 1883.

Logging soon began in the nearby forests. Lumber workers of Scandinavian, English, and Scots-Irish descent arrived and settled in the neighboring valleys. In 1940, the chief local industries were dairying, poultry raising, fruit growing, milk condensing, fruit and vegetable packing, brick and tile manufacturing, coal mining, portable house manufacturing, and fern shipping.

During World War II, Chehalis was home to a Boeing manufacturing plant. The factory was responsible for producing wing parts for airplanes, particularly for B-17 and B-29 bombers. The plant, which received Boeing&#x27;s excellence pennant, existed between 1943 and 1945 and was located in the Harry B. Quick building. Built in the mid-1920s, it has been owned by the Lewis County Public Utilities District since the early 1940s. A plaque, installed on the exterior of the building in 2005 on the 60th anniversary of the war&#x27;s end, honors the workers of the Boeing manufactory, of which 70% were Rosie the Riveters.

The city, known for its flooding events, suffered damages and hardship during other natural disasters and severe weather events. A report in the aftermath of the 1949 Olympia earthquake listed that approximately 40% of local Chehalis businesses and homes were damaged, including a tally of over 1,300 chimneys. One Chehalis resident was reported as injured and the Green Hill School, which lost the use of four buildings, recorded $2 million in damages. The high school and the West Side School were destroyed; neither was rebuilt. Chehalis was also hit hard during the Hanukkah Eve windstorm of 2006, with the interstate closed south of the city due to fallen trees.

A vessel in the United States Navy, the gunboat USS &quot;Chehalis&quot; (PGM-94), was named in honor of the city.

===Flooding===

Due to Chehalis being located near several large rivers and resting in a valley, heavy rains and snowmelt has led the city to experience numerous historic flooding events, often recorded between November and February.

Historical accounts and spiritual lessons passed down in the history of Native American people living in and around the Chehalis River tell of major floods in the basin. The first record of a flood, when the community known as Saundersville was settled, was in 1865. The first newspaper accounting of floods mention events in 1887 and 1897 that disrupted sawmill operations and river and railroad traffic. 

The 20th century recorded over two dozen notable flooding events in and around the Chehalis community. The earliest recordings of floods are from 1906, 1909, and 1910, with major floods in 1915 and 1919. Chehalis, which was submerged in a month-long rain event, broke flood records in 1933 and moderate floods followed later in the decade. A 1948 weather pattern, a widespread disaster for the state, led to flooding in Chehalis. Heavy rains in the early-to-mid 1950s bought moderate floodwaters.

The Christmas flood of 1964 led to widespread floodwaters in 1965. A record-setting flood occurred in 1972, submerging the interstate for the first time in the city. The Chehalis River crested twice in January 1974, causing $10 million in losses. A major flood disaster developed in 1986 after of rainfall over several days that led to the submerging of the fairgrounds and a contamination spill at a closed industrial site near Millett Field. The highway was covered with floodwaters again during a major flood disaster 1990. A 100-year flood occurred in February 1996, with the Chehalis and Skookumchuck rivers setting flood stage records. A state of emergency was declared and I-5 was closed for four days.

The city in the 21st century has had several floods of various levels including a record flood that closed the interstate in the town in December 2007 due to the Great Coastal Gale of 2007. Another major flood materialized over a year later in January 2009, immersing several regions within Chehalis, and I-5 and railroads were shut down once again. Less severe floods transpired during record daily rainfalls in 2010, 2012, and 2015. A stretch of I-5 between Chehalis and Centralia was closed for several hours after a major flood in January 2022.

===Hate crimes and supremacy===
Chehalis has not been immune to a history of hate crimes, racism, and white supremacy groups. An article written in the Chehalis Bee-Nugget newspaper from 1909 details a letter from a Black man who considered Chehalis a &quot;white man&#x27;s city&quot; and would not move to the town. While the piece mentions that the people of Chehalis have not exhibited hostilities towards non-White people, the editorial does report that a Black family has never resided in the city while also acknowledging a lack of representation for citizens of Asian heritage. At the beginning of the 1910 Chehalis Gophers baseball season, the club and its ballplayers participated in a minstrel show, receiving positive reviews in a local paper. An &quot;anti-Greek and Italian&quot; movement existed in Chehalis around 1911 that demanded to abolish the employment of foreigners within the town.

In 1924, a rally for the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) was held at the Southwest Washington Fairgrounds and the estimated attendance was recorded between 20,000 and 30,000 members from around Washington. During the Great Depression, Chehalis and the surrounding cities and counties saw a rise in the participation of &quot;Silver Shirts&quot;, a group that followed similar aspects to the Nazi movement of the era. In a Life magazine article from March 1939, the publication reported regarding hate groups and said Chehalis had a hate group leader in it, purportedly a local insurance man. A trio of female high school students wrote to the magazine, believing that the feature &quot;did not accurately depict the feelings of local citizens&quot; just the insurance man and his followers, and a follow-up photo article from Life in May showcased the city&#x27;s actual more varied and &quot;American ideals&quot; atmosphere which tended to more highlight inclusion, tolerance and diversity. It was noted that the leader of that fascist group had left town after the original story had published.

After World War II, the emergence of the John Birch Society (JBS), which opposed the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, began to circulate in and around the community, though much of the group’s noted activity occurred outside Chehalis with the group opening a bookstore in Centralia. Active and open participation from county residents in either the KKK or the JBS began to wane in the 1970s and 1980s, and the last activity of either group was recorded as taking place at the end of the century. The city, due to its early history and present-day lack of a Black population, was listed as a sundown town though there is no evidence the city ever had sundown policies.

Residents in the city in more recent years have protested in favor of the Black Lives Matter movement, holding two demonstrations in 2020 at the Lewis County Courthouse after the murder of George Floyd. The second event was attended by approximately 300 people who knelt for 8 minutes 46 seconds in protest against police brutality. Notwithstanding a brief interruption, the assembly remained peaceful.

A rise in hate crimes against LGBTQ people in the 21st century also affected Chehalis, usually perpetrated or led by non-Chehalis residents. In the 2020s, a billboard in Chehalis supporting LGBTQ and racial equality movements was vandalized. And a drag show held in June 2023 at the Chehalis Theater was a site of controversy when a political fundraiser that referred to drag performers as &quot;groomers&quot; was hosted nearby without theater approval by the Lewis County GOP, headed by a non-Chehalis resident, and timed so as to coincide with the drag show in the Chehalis Theater and a similarly protested Pride event that had been held in Centralia earlier that day. The GOP’s actions were shortly after condemned by local leaders. A few weeks later, a single-evening hate crime act occurred that targeted LGBTQ charities and symbols within various locations of the city. The Chehalis Friendship Fence was vandalized during the hate crime attack. The fence was repainted days later through a volunteer effort. The fence was targeted again in February 2024 after a group of three people, all with ties to a variety of hate groups, as well as previous hate crime acts, splashed the artwork with black paint. The perpetrators, who were not from Chehalis, were chased down by a local resident and caught; fellow neighbors were able to wipe the paint off before it dried but the damages were severe enough that parts of the local attraction needed to be repainted. The trio were found guilty of misdemeanor malicious mischief but were acquitted by jury on hate crime charges.

===Claquato===
As translated from the Chehalis Native American language, Claquato means &quot;high prairie&quot; or &quot;high land&quot;. The town began as a settlement in 1853 by Lewis Hawkins Davis, who originally named the area Davis Prairie. The community grew quickly to include Claquato Church, a cemetery, hotels, and several stores and was, for a time, the largest populated town between the Columbia River and Olympia. Davis donated land for the construction of a courthouse and by 1862 the town became the county seat for Lewis County until that designation was transferred to Chehalis in 1874. A blockhouse was built and used in the community during an 1855-1856 war between settlers and Native Americans, sheltering the founding family of Chehalis during the conflict.

Claquato is no longer a recognized town or municipality, and is considered a neighborhood outside the Chehalis city limits. While described as a ghost town as it was officially vacated in 1902, the area has been populated since its inception.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

The city rests in a valley bordered by foothills of the Cascade Range to the east and the Willapa Hills to the west. Chehalis straddles Interstate 5 at a point almost exactly halfway between Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon. The historic downtown and most of the city&#x27;s amenities lie on the east side of the freeway, nestled at the base of a small range of forested hills. On the west side of the freeway are parks, farms, a few subdivisions developed in the hills to the west, and a centralized shopping district, the Twin City Town Center. The Chehalis–Centralia Airport is located immediately west of the freeway towards the northern end of the city. From numerous vantage points in the city and the Willapa Hills, there are views of Boistfort Peak and the three major volcanic mountains of the Cascades, Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, and Mount St. Helens, depending on weather conditions.

The Chehalis River winds its way through the valley in which the city resides, and is joined by a tributary, the Newaukum River. This confluence of waters, along with the intersections of tributaries and railroads within Chehalis, helped the city become known as &quot;The Maple Leaf City&quot;. Both the Chehalis and Newaukum rivers are prone to flooding during periods of abnormally heavy or persistent rain, and the lowlands from the freeway westward are particularly susceptible to inundation. Near the Port of Chehalis is Dillenbaugh Creek, a watershed encompassing over .

===Climate===
This region experiences warm and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 °F (22.0 °C). According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Chehalis has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps.


====Weather events and records====
The city was hit with 100 mph winds gusts during the Columbus Day storm of 1962. The highest temperature ever recorded in the city was 107.0 °F (41.7 °C) in July 2009. Chehalis matched that record high on June 28, 2021, while surpassing other daily and monthly heat records for the month during the 2021 Western North America heat wave.

===Homelessness===
The Point In Time Count (PTC) is a county census that is required by law to count the number of the population experiencing homelessness. Mandated by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) since 2003, the annual PTC tracks the number of individuals and families experiencing homelessness on a specified date and is usually held in January. It is organized locally with data transmitted to state and federal agencies. Students and children under the age of 18 who are described as, &quot;in an overnight accommodation insecure situation&quot;, are not officially recorded as part of the PTC. However, the city of Chehalis had a count in 2017 reporting 130 students, and an incomplete count the following year of 136, who met the qualifications to be listed as homeless.

==Economy==

After the loss of a large pharmaceutical plant in 1952, the Chehalis community organized a group named &quot;Adventure in Cooperation&quot; which led to the beginnings of a commission that created the Chehalis Industrial Park later that decade. The economic area began when a new rail line, built by a group of local volunteers known as the &quot;Gandy Dancers&quot;, was connected to the grounds. The industrial park, located south of the city district near the interstate, leases land that it purchases to corporations and businesses. The first tenant was a $1.0 million Goodyear Tire plant that opened in 1957.

The Port of Chehalis was officially established in September 1986 and was one of the last ports created in the state. The port was enacted by a public vote in Lewis County, which also developed a port district in the city. The agency oversees the Chehalis Industrial Park and the port is part of the South Puget Sound Foreign Trade Zone.

Food processing, which included canned or frozen items, has been a long-term economic sector of Chehalis, expanding in importance during the 1950s after the construction of U.S. Route 12 and Interstate 5.

Callison&#x27;s, formally known as I.P. Callison&#x27;s &amp; Sons, was founded in the city in 1903. The company originally processed cascara bark, used as a laxative, and shipped a variety of flora for use in flower arrangements. Callison&#x27;s expanded to produce peppermint in the 1940s, spearmint in 1952, and eventually essential oils, including the production of foxglove for medicinal use. The company headquarters and exporting components were moved to Lacey but the manufacturing plant remains in Chehalis. The company produces mint used in the production of candies at Chehalis Mints, a local confectioner that began in 1994.

The Lewis County Mall, situated south of the Lewis County Fairgrounds, was built in 1972. The mall was home to national chains and major retailers but in 1999, JC Penney&#x27;s departed the venue and other businesses followed soon thereafter due in part to the growth of other shopping centers in the local area. Sears was the last nationwide company to leave. In the 2000s, the 10-screen Midway Cinema was established in the building. , the mall is home to smaller, regional businesses and plans include a renovation of the center for storage, apartment buildings, and restaurants.

Timber, once an important economic component of the city, began increasing in the 2000s and the city became a warehousing center due to its access to the interstate and its location between Portland and Seattle. Beginning in the 2010s, the city embarked on increasing its economic diversity by creating an auto row for passenger vehicle dealerships at the Twin City Town Center district. Due in part to renovations of the Recreation Park Complex, and a subsequent growth in attendance for sports events, the community entered a growth phase in the hospitality industry.

==Arts and culture==

===Art===
Based on a plan approved by the city council in 2009, the Chehalis Community Renaissance Team (CCRT) was formed and implemented artistic improvements as part of long term revitalization project for downtown Chehalis. With funds provided by CCRT via community donations and various city, county, and state programs, local artists and business owners have produced artworks on utility boxes, trash can lids, and benches, along with additional murals and building façade renovations in the downtown and surrounding business districts.

A rainbow painted fence, known as the Chehalis Friendship Fence, is located in the city&#x27;s Pennsylvania-Westside district near Westside Park. It was first created in 2020 and is a show of support of LGBTQ+ people and their rights.

Sculptures located in Chehalis include &quot;The Guardian&quot;, a bronze work situated at the Lewis County Law and Justice Center. Created to honor local police officers who lost their lives in the line of duty, the artwork depicts a little girl along with an officer and a police dog. Four statues, portraying young children in various states of play, are located at the Recreation Park Complex. A bronze sculpture of a little girl sitting on a bench reading a book is located at the Vernetta Smith Timberland Library. The book was stolen but replaced in 2021. A sculpture containing multiple basalt columns is located at a commercial development near the I-5 exchange on Main Street known as Liberty Plaza. Created to honor American military veterans, the piece is part of a fountain. The artwork was dedicated in 2009 and features a column standing in height, at the time thought to be the tallest such type in the world.

Chehalis is part of the ARTrails of Southwest Washington initiative. The cooperative, begun in 2003, showcases local artists, art studios and galleries throughout the region, and holds an annual autumnal studio tour that incorporates events in smaller towns within Lewis County. The Lewis County Historical Museum has hosted, since 2015, a permanent ARTrails gallery.

===Charitable groups===
Among the earliest women&#x27;s groups in Washington state, the St. Helen&#x27;s Club of Chehalis was founded on February 5, 1895. The literary organization, a member of the General Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs (GFWC) since 1896, has advocated for the importance of &quot;literature, arts, science and vital issues of the day&quot;, a motto stretching back to the founding days of the club. The St. Helen&#x27;s Club has invested in lobbying efforts focusing on issues of betterment for the state but mainly provides scholarships for high school and college women, including foreign-born students, attending colleges in the state. During the group&#x27;s history, the women organized petitions in the early 1900s to demand clean streets and organized livestock drives within Chehalis, opened a women&#x27;s rest stop in downtown, and planted what was referred to as &quot;a mile of trees&quot; at the fairgrounds. The group led restoration endeavors of the John R. Jackson House at the Jackson House State Park Heritage Site in 1915. As part of a state-wide GFWC initiative, the St. Helen&#x27;s Club helped to raise funds to purchase land for the Federation Forest State Park near Enumclaw, Washington during the late 1920s.

===Cuisine===
In 2021, two restaurants in the city, &quot;Once Upon A Thyme&quot;, a luncheon diner, and &quot;Mackinaw&#x27;s&quot;, which caters to fine dining, were featured in back-to-back episodes of the television show, Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.

Mackinaw&#x27;s, which was located at the Hotel Washington, was subjected to fines, loss of a liquor license, and eventual closure for failing to adhere to Covid-19 protocols for restaurants. Another restaurant, &quot;Spiffy&#x27;s&quot;, continued indoor dining in 2020 during early lockdown laws amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The establishment was levied with $400,000 in fines and the restaurant, which existed for 50 years, shut down the following year.

Chehalis became home to the Sweet Dough Cookie Co. in 2024. The bakery, once located in Centralia, is owned and operated by Ashlee Shirer, a back-to-back winner on the Food Network&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Cookie Challenge&quot;.

===Festivals and events===
The city hosts a yearly, June-to-October, Community Farmers Market of Chehalis in its historic downtown on Boistfort Street. First begun in 2005, the market is part of a larger Lewis County farmers market initiative. It is opened on Tuesday afternoons and as of 2024, is the only such market within a radius. Locally grown fruits and vegetables, as well as prepared food and art wares from the area, are often the leading focus of the market. The history of farmers markets in the city date to 1928, when the community began its first public market at the Chehalis municipal auditorium; the market shifted to Boistfort Street later that year due to lack of shoppers.

An annual, multi-day &quot;ChehalisFest&quot; is usually held at the end of July. Once titled, &quot;Krazy Days&quot;, the early festival included a &quot;saucer drop&quot; of candy and gift-filled cardboard flying saucers that celebrated the 1947 flying disc craze. The event is hosted by Experience Chehalis (previously the Chehalis Community Renaissance Team), and is centrally located in the historic downtown district but expands to local tourist locations, including the Chehalis-Centralia Airport and Veterans Memorial Museum. Food, music, child activities, art walks, sidewalk sales, and car shows are often the highlights of the festivities.

A mid-summer Music in the Park free concert series takes place annually at Recreation Park. The event is typically held on three consecutive Fridays, with a different performer each evening. Based on local music demographics, country singers and cover bands often headline the series.

Chehalis borders the Southwest Washington Fairgrounds, which hosts an annual state fair, usually in August. The Lewis County Fair first took place in the city in 1891 and continued to do so until 1909 when the fairgrounds began hosting the event after the site was constructed.

In commemoration of the Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting and the city&#x27;s connection to the event, the downtown district hosts the &quot;Chehalis Flying Saucer Party&quot; which first began in 2019. The festival revived the Krazy Day&#x27;s tradition of the &quot;saucer drop&quot; and is usually a two-day, September celebration. It includes symposiums, a parade, musical performances, and UFO-themed activities in the city, with several exhibits about the sighting displayed at the Lewis County Historical Museum. In 2023, a short film competition, the &quot;Northwest Flying Saucer Film Fest&quot;, was introduced to the event.

Chehalis&#x27;s Santa Parade takes place in early December. A theme is chosen every year and local residents are selected as grand marshals as recognition for their community service. The route courses thru the historic downtown district and immediate business core with floats and school marching bands the prime spotlight of the event. Held almost continuously since the 1940s, the parade celebrated 70 years in 2019.

===Historic buildings and sites===


The city began a historical commission in the 1980s to honor and recognize buildings in Chehalis for their historical importance as well as preservation efforts. Given the moniker, the Chehalis Historic Preservation Commission, the committee&#x27;s largest listing was in 2005 with 37 homes recognized; all were located in NRHP districts in the community. Each home or building is given a plaque that lists the original construction date, and may contain dates and names regarding conservation efforts. The commission, in the mid-2000s, was responsible for the beginnings of restoration efforts in the downtown district, specifically programs to improve and revitalize building façades.

The Chehalis Downtown Historic District was honored with placement on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1997, notably for its Colonial Revival architecture. Two other NRHP district locations registered within Chehalis include the Hillside Historic District and the Pennsylvania Avenue-West Side Historic District. NRHP-listed buildings include the Chehalis Post Office, the Lewis County Courthouse, the county museum once known as the Burlington Northern Depot, the 1920s St. Helens Hotel, and the Troop 373 and 7373 Scout Lodge. The homes of John R. Jackson, O.B. McFadden, and O.K. Palmer are also listed with the NRHP.

Other historical buildings include the Chehalis Theater, originally known as the Pix Theater when it was opened in 1938, but renamed in 1954. The building, constructed in 1923, was first home to a Ford car dealership. Across from the courthouse sits the Judge Seymour White House, a Victorian house built in 1904 that was planned for demolition in 1986 after it was deemed a public nuisance. A public outcry saved the home. Given the nickname, &quot;House of Ill Repute&quot;, it once was used as a brothel. The 1889 Washington Hotel is situated in the downtown district and was restored by a local family in 1997 following a destructive fire. It served as a movie house and vaudeville theater, known as the Dream Theater, and once hosted the Vintage Motorcycle Museum.

To commemorate the 100th anniversary of Ezra Meeker&#x27;s journey on the Oregon Trail, the city, by way of the Lewis County Historical Society, installed an historical marker at city hall. As part of a promise from towns along Meeker&#x27;s trip to erect markers to honor the trail, Chehalis was one of the last areas to fulfill the obligation. Another marker was subsequently placed at Claquato Church in the nearby neighborhood of Claquato, the oldest continuously used church in Washington state.

The Vernetta Smith Chehalis Timberland Library, built in 2008 as a replacement of the city&#x27;s 1910 Carnegie library, is operated by the Timberland Regional Library and named in honor of the mother of former Chehalis resident, Orin Smith.

===Tourism===
Chehalis is home to the Veteran&#x27;s Memorial Museum which was originally begun in 1995 and opened in Centralia in 1997. The museum contains a volumetric library of military history, and visitors can participate in direct interactions with visiting United States war veterans as well as browse thru a 9,000 square foot gallery. The site is home to the mast of the USS Nicholas (DD-449), and the grounds exhibit both a complete Bell AH-1 Cobra helicopter and a Republic F-105 Thunderchief fighter-bomber. The museum has hosted an annual, late-summer &quot;Rust or Shine Car Show and Music Festival&quot; since 2015, becoming the biggest automobile show in the county. In cooperation with other organizations, the museum sponsors an annual American Civil War reenactment in the city.

The Chehalis-Centralia Railroad Museum (CCRM) is located south of the veteran&#x27;s museum and hosts the Chehalis–Centralia Railroad which offers an passenger train ride that traverses through the Twin City corridor and the Chehalis River Valley. The train, a 1916 Baldwin Locomotive Engine No. 15 from the Cowlitz, Chehalis &amp; Cascade Railway, was once a display located at Recreation Park and was restored in the mid-1980s.

A swap meet mall, Yard Birds, is a local landmark known for its large, metal and wood sculpture of a black bird. The mall was permanently closed in 2022 and threatened to be condemned due to code compliance and safety issues but the order was lifted at the end of the year. , the attraction still remains.
Located at the Lewis County Historical Museum is the McKinley Stump, a replica of a tall remnant of a Douglas fir cut down in 1901 near Pe Ell. Dated between 360 and 700 years old, it was meant to be used as a speech pedestal for President William McKinley, but the event was cancelled. Theodore Roosevelt used it two years later and William H. Taft employed the stump as a podium in 1907. The artifact was originally placed in downtown under a pagoda, but was moved to the railroad depot and then to Recreation Park after damages due to arson in the late 1940s. After an infestation of carpenter ants and subsequent rot, the stump was removed from the park in 2007 and a replica stump, cut from Tenino, was installed at the museum in 2008 with a restored pagoda and a display of an undamaged slab of the original stump.

==Sports==
Bicycling is a popular sport in Chehalis, hosting along with other towns on the State Route 6 corridor an annual &quot;Ride The Willapa&quot; bike ride that raises money for the Willapa Hills Trail. The Lewis County Historic Bike Ride, an annual fundraising event since the early 1990s, features ride options that vary from easy to advanced, and traverses through the city. The bike ride is used by Seattle to Portland Bicycle Classic (STP) participants as a practice run. Chehalis is included as part of the route for the STP which traverses around the airport and winds through downtown and connected neighborhood districts. Riders of the STP will overnight in the city as an overflow option to Centralia. Klein Bicycle Corporation, connected to the city during its early years of production, sponsored the three-stage Klein Classic in the 1990s. A bicycle event for local residents, known as the Centralia to Chehalis Bike Ride, was held continuously from the late 20th century into the 3rd millennium. The &quot;C to C&quot; route meandered from George Washington Park in Centralia, to around the airport, and finishing at Recreation Park after traversing through several residential neighborhoods.

Chehalis&#x27;s Millet Field used to host minor league baseball, including such teams as the Gophers, Proteges, and Farmers; the 1912 Chehalis Farmer&#x27;s team was awarded the league championship. The field accommodated semi-pro baseball and football from the turn of the 20th century into the 1970s. Several Negro League games were played in the town.

Two parks within the city limits, Recreation and Stan Hedwall Parks, are used for a variety of W.F. West High School sports competitions and for tournaments involving high schools within Lewis County. The high school hosted a preseason exhibition game between the Portland Trail Blazers and the Seattle SuperSonics in 1970, marking the beginning of the I-5 Rivalry.

==Parks and recreation==

The city has several parks, many of which are based on land donated by Chehalis residents. Money raised to build, maintain, or upgrade the area&#x27;s park system has long been done by community fundraising efforts.

The largest park, the Recreation Park Complex, is located in Chehalis&#x27;s South Market district and contains four separate units. The Gail and Carolyn Shaw Aquatics Center&#x27; opened in August 2014 and it replaced the original 1959 Chehalis Community Pool. The Chet and Henrietta Rhodes Spray Park, completed in 2007, adjoins the aquatic center, geared mostly for young children and people with disabilities. Recreation Park is the largest of the area, and is home to four softball and youth baseball fields, picnic areas, paved walking paths, and a community center and kitchen. It was recently rebuilt in 2020 along with the abutting Penny Playground, a fenced play area geared for children. The playground&#x27;s name comes from the donation drives used to help fund the building of the park in 1993.

Two additional parks are furnished for athletics and organized sports. Stan Hedwall Park straddles the Newaukum River with 200 acres of ball fields, RV parking, trails, and open and forested areas. Millett Field was formerly home to a semi-pro baseball team in the early 20th century, and regularly used for sports since it opened in 1898 and developed in 1908. A basketball court and a playground area, both created by local charitable acts in the early 2000s, are the focus of the park.

Several parks organized and built for leisure and family activities are dispersed within the city limits. Westside Park, located in the Pennsylvania Avenue-West Side Historic District, contains basketball courts, a playground, and picnic areas. Lintott-Alexander Park, located on land that was donated in the early 20th century by a Chehalis family, is a park that was restored after a monetary contribution from a former community resident in 2004. A pair of the oldest recreational areas in the city, John Dobson and McFadden Parks, are a combined and are located in the Hillside District on Park Hill. A shared trail, the Dobson-McFadden, bridges the parks and leads to open views to much of Chehalis, including downtown, and the Newaukum River valley.

Several Chehalis parks contain walking paths and trails but there are three separate trails of note. The Airport Levee Trail is a mixed paved-gravel trail that loops for up to and is situated between farm land and the Chehalis-Centralia Airport. It connects with the nearby Airport Road Trail, a paved, mixed-use trail that parallels Interstate 5 for ; it is part of long-term plan to link the recreational areas between the Twin Cities. The Willapa Hills Trail stretches from Chehalis to South Bend, Washington. Built over a late 19th century railroad, it is now a mix of paving and compact gravel and is open to hikers, bicyclists, and horse riding.

==Environment and ecology==
The city owns and operates the Chehalis Poplar Tree Farm located east of Claquato on State Route 6. The 11-unit, site grows nine hybrid varieties of poplar and the trees are harvested on a rotating basis in sectioned units every 8 to 10 years. The lumber is sold to produce paper. The farm is part of Chehalis&#x27; water treatment program. As of 2008, Class 1 wastewater, rather than be fully discharged in the Chehalis River as was common practice before the tree farm was created, is used to hydrate the poplar fields through the use of irrigation pipes. Reclaimed and treated water not absorbed by the poplars recharges the local aquifer. The farm was informally known as the &quot;Chehalis Poplar Tree Plantation&quot; and was renamed to its current moniker in 2021 due to local action requesting the removal of the word &quot;plantation&quot; as the term was considered objectionable.
The area is populated by cascara, defined as a bush or tree depending on its size. The main harvesting of the plant is for its bark, commonly used as a laxative.

The Chehalis River and Dillenbaugh Creek watersheds in the city are home to migrating coho salmon and the ecosystems support beaver and deer.

The city contains two Superfund sites. A major flood in 1986 led to a contamination cleanup at a closed industrial site, known as American Crossarm and Conduit, near Millett Field. Approximately of a mixture of creosote and diesel fuel, as well as cancer-causing chemicals such as dioxin and pentachlorophenol used in the treatment of lumber, spread into the surrounding neighborhoods as well as the Dillenbaugh Creek watershed. The $9.5 million hazardous cleanup was undertaken by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the area was listed in 1988 as a federal superfund site; the remediation was not completed until 1996. , the Hamilton/Labree Roads Groundwater Contamination site is an ongoing remediation project. Located south of the city at Berwick Creek, the contamination area consists of three connected sites. The concerns include the dumping of PERC and buried drums of other hazardous chemicals which has affected the soil and water system in the area. First noticed in 1993, cleanup began in 2020.

==Government and politics==

Chehalis has a council–manager system of government that consists of an elected city council and an appointed city manager. The city council has seven members, of which three come from at-large seats, and selects a ceremonial mayor from its members. The council was formed in November 1975 after a city-wide vote to change from a three-person commission to a seven-member board. The inaugural council included the election of the first woman mayor of Chehalis, Viviane Roewe.

The city is located in District 1 of Lewis County and as of March 2021, represented by County Commissioner Sean Swope.

===Politics===
Chehalis historically leans to the right, but less than Lewis County as a whole.

Third parties receiving votes in the 2016 and 2020 election were the Libertarian Party and Green Party, and there were 15 votes for Write-in candidates. The 2016 election also included votes for the Constitution Party.

===Crime and criminal justice===
The Green Hill School, the state&#x27;s only maximum security penitentiary for youths, is located in the South Market district. The city is also home to the Lewis County Jail, situated across from the Lewis County Courthouse in the government district.

==Education==
The Chehalis School District (CSD) provides public education to Chehalis students from pre-kindergarten to 12th grade. Elementary students attend James W. Lintott Elementary from pre-kindergarten to 2nd grade, moving to Orin C. Smith Elementary to complete third to 5th grade. Chehalis Middle School, built in 1989, hosts grades 6th thru 8th. W.F. West High School, opened in 1951, provides a completion of primary education from 9th to 12th grades.

Both elementary schools were built concurrent in 2018 and fully opened in 2019. They replaced the previous primary schools of Cascade (built 1922), R.E.Bennet (opened in 1928), and Olympic (built 1960).

The city also provides schooling for rehabilitating juvenile males at Green Hill School, with options for students to obtain a high school or general equivalency diploma (GED), vocational training, and college prep courses, with additional opportunities to earn an associate or bachelor degree via a joint partnership with Centralia College.

==Media==

===Film and television===
Several movies have been filmed in and around Chehalis, including &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot;, and the independent film &quot;Maysville&quot;. Diverse documentaries filmed in the city include the environmental feature about the Chehalis river basin, &quot;Chehalis : A Watershed Moment&quot;, and the movie, &quot;Skinny and Fatty: The Story of Yard Birds&quot;, a reflection on a local market attraction.

===Newspapers===
The earliest recorded newspaper published in Chehalis was in 1883, the &quot;Lewis County Nugget&quot;, with the &quot;Lewis County Bee&quot; forming a year later. Between 1887 and 1888, both publications dropped the county title and became the &quot;Chehalis Bee&quot; and the &quot;Chehalis Nugget&quot;. The city was also home to &quot;The People&#x27;s Advocate&quot; beginning in 1892, providing three competing papers in Chehalis until the &quot;Bee&quot; and &quot;Nugget&quot; merged in 1898 to become &quot;The Chehalis Bee-Nugget&quot;. The &quot;Advocate&quot; became the &quot;Lewis County Advocate&quot; in 1903. The &quot;Bee-Nugget&quot; survived until 1938 when it joined with the &quot;Lewis County Advocate&quot; to become &quot;The Chehalis Advocate&quot;. With the exception of &quot;The Scoop&quot;, a brief upstart of a daily publication in the 1950s, the merger left Chehalis with one surviving news publication produced in the city. &quot;The Chehalis Advocate&quot;, due to a loss of ad revenue and rising costs, folded in 1963. A weekly newspaper known as The Weekly News, and then as the Chehalis Times, was begun in 1979 but folded two years later. Since then, Chehalis has been without a city-produced newspaper and local news reports for the residents of Chehalis are provided by &quot;The Chronicle&quot;, a weekly newspaper published in Centralia.

A ghost sign for the Chehalis Bee-Nugget was found in 2009, and subsequently preserved, during a renovation of Chehalis&#x27;s historic St. Helens Theater.

===Radio===
The Chehalis area has two licensed FM radio stations, KACS - 90.5 FM, which broadcasts a Christian format, and KMNT - 104.3 FM, providing country music to the community. Additional stations include Centralia College owned KCED - 91.3 FM, which transmits Alternative programming, and the Adult contemporary music radio broadcaster KITI-FM - 95.1 FM, based in Winlock. Centralia based AM radio station, KELA 1470 is a mixed sports and talk broadcaster.

==Infrastructure==

===Flood control===
Lewis County and various other regional governments, in association with environmental groups, scientists, and local citizens, organized a partnership in the early 2010s named the Chehalis Basin Strategy to propose and research a combination of plans along the Chehalis River to mitigate flooding and to restore aquatic habitat for local Chinook salmon. The proposal outlines several flood control reduction measures, with downstream levee improvements particularly at the Centralia-Chehalis Airport, and a flood retention dam in Pe Ell which is planned to limit catastrophic damage from 100-year floods within the Chehalis River Basin.

===Healthcare===
The first known hospital in the city was built in 1903 within the Pennsylvania Avenue-West Side Historic District. Four years later, the St. Helens Hospital was constructed as a site to treat elderly and poor citizens. The wood building was razed after the 1927 concrete build of a new and expanded St. Helens Hospital. The care center was expanded again in 1952 and a nursing home annex was added in 1964. Another expansion in 1970 included such additions as a surgery center and pharmacy but by the mid-1970s, the hospital was reported as struggling financially. The site became of use as a detox and addiction recovery center run by American Behavioral Health Systems.

Chehalis is served by Centralia&#x27;s 128-bed, non-profit Providence Centralia Hospital for short-term acute care that also provides services for surgery, cancer, obstetrics, and is equipped with a 24-hour emergency room and an ICU. There are several clinics in Chehalis, including Providence Chehalis Family Medicine, Northwest Pediatric Care, and Chehalis Children&#x27;s Clinic. Mental health services are provided by Cascade Mental Health Care.

The Lewis County Public Health &amp; Social Services building is located in the government district of the city, north of the Lewis County Courthouse.

Military veterans were able to procure health services at the Lewis County Community-Based Outpatient Clinic located in the Lewis County Mall but the facilities were closed in 2021 due to patient expenses that were considered the highest in the nation for a Veteran&#x27;s Administration (VA) clinic. Patients have since been directed to an Olympia VA clinic and additional local health services have been provided by a mobile medical unit overseen by the Seattle-based VA Puget Sound Health Care System.

===Transportation===
Chehalis is served by Interstate 5, the main north–south freeway in Western Washington, which connects the city to Seattle and Portland. The freeway also carries a section of U.S. Route 12, an east–west highway that continues to Aberdeen and across the Cascades to the Yakima River Valley and Tri-Cities. Chehalis is the location of the eastern cessation point of State Route 6, a highway that travels west to a junction with U.S. Route 101 in Raymond. The Chehalis terminus converts into West Main Street with access to the city through the government district.

Four other bridges provide direct access to the city district. Chamber of Commerce Way connects to the city shopping center and heads over a 1951 railroad overpass and to the original arterial highway before the interstate was built. The West Side Bridge (West Bridge) accommodates traffic into the Pennsylvania Avenue-West Side Historic District and a route towards downtown. An overpass, referred to as the 13th Street Bridge, provides a connection to the South Market district, Recreation Park, and the Green Hill School. The Labree Road Bridge, built in 2007, provides an access route for the Port of Chehalis.

Twin Transit provides public transit service to Chehalis and neighboring Centralia, with connections to other communities. Early 20th century public transportation for residents relied on a streetcar line operated by the local Twin City Railroad Company, which connected the city with neighboring Centralia. As the community began to favor travel by bus, the service was discontinued by 1929.

The Chehalis–Centralia Airport (CLS) is located within the city limits. The airport is a single runway, public use hub for air travel in Lewis County. First begun as a small airfield in 1927, it is bordered by the local shopping district and I-5 and is approximately one mile west of the Chehalis downtown district. It is the largest of the three airports within the county.

====Railroads====
The earliest connection for Chehalis to new railroads in the region was in 1873 when the first depot in the area was erected in Newaukum. A local resident paid a conductor to stop in Saundersville, eventually leading to the build of a warehouse depot in the town that became Chehalis. A standard train station was completed in 1883, replaced in 1912 by a depot that became the Lewis County Historical Society and Museum. Economic conditions improved drastically in the city, leading to a large build-up of the downtown core. Competing railroads, attempting to connect Chehalis to the Pacific coast, begin around 1890. A rail company, the Pacific, Chehalis &amp; Eastern, operated a line to Sea Haven; funded by prominent residents, the venture failed by 1891. A freight railroad that led to South Bend was operated by the Northern Pacific Railway Company and became successful after full operations began in 1893. Passenger service began on the line and provided the city with an increase in local shopping. The passenger trains began to decrease during the Great Depression and ceased by 1954 due to competition with automobile travel.

Chehalis, in 1916, began being served by a short rail line operated by the Cowlitz, Chehalis, &amp; Cascade Railroad. The line transported milk from local dairy farms to condensing plants in the city and provided lumber from surrounding timberlands to sawmills and woodworking producers in Chehalis.

Other railroads in the city include the Chehalis Western Railroad, a portion of which became part of the Chehalis–Centralia Railroad after the line was sold.

===Utilities===
====Communications====
The first telephone operations in Chehalis began in 1891 when the city was connected to the Sunset Telephone and Telegraph Company in Centralia. An official exchange began in 1893 and connection availability for the entirety of the community was completed in 1898, which included 35 total subscribers. The company, then serving approximately 1,000 customers in the Twin Cities, was renamed in 1916 to the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company. By the mid-1960s, the area was served by Pacific Northwest Bell and had a subscriber list of over 12,000 between Centralia and Chehalis.

====Electricity====
Lewis County PUD provides electricity within the city, 75% that is generated via hydroelectricity. Natural gas and infrastructure for residents and businesses within the city limits is provided by Puget Sound Energy.

====Renewable energy====
Chehalis received grants of $4.45 million in 2021 to build the first hydrogen fueling station in Washington state; it is to be initially overseen by Twin Transit. The site, scheduled for completion in mid-2023, is located in the southern portion of the city on Port of Chehalis property off I-5 and is planned to operate on of the plat and be capable for usage of up to 2 megawatts. The self-service facility will have two fuel pressure stations, light-duty and heavy duty, of 700 and 350-bar fuel pressure, respectively.

The city installed its first charging stations for electric vehicles in 2018 at a shopping center on city-owned land. The station originally had four stalls and was later expanded through legislation from the city government. Chehalis is part of a broader initiative to provide charging stations along the White Pass Scenic Byway.

====Sanitation====
, Chehalis residents obtain garbage collection services, required by city ordinance, with Harold LeMay Enterprises.

====Water====
The City of Chehalis Water Division is responsible for clean drinking water, including water treatment and operations, and maintains reservoirs and tanks for a storage capacity of over 6.7 million gallons. The primary source for water is the North Fork of the Newaukum River, which the city is allowed to draw, as of 2023, two-thousand acre feet per year (3.1 million gallons per day). The Chehalis River is a secondary source, with the city allowed to siphon 1 million gallons daily. Flouridation of the water supply began in 1951.

In the 21st century, water-use efficiency programs, required by the Washington State Department of Health (DOH), reached a goal to reduce water use by 25,000 gallons daily and introduced an additional goal of a 3% reduction during summer. Based on a 2024 water system plan, also required by DOH, Chehalis oversees of water lines, supplying per minute to 3,800 connections. With new water lines built in the southern portion of the city limits in 2023 and 2024, the city has adequate water supply until 2040. , the city&#x27;s water treatment facilities, built in 1961, provide 4.8 million gallons of water per day and is expected to be of sufficient use until 2036.

==Sister city==
Chehalis has been a sister city with Inasa, Shizuoka, Japan since 1990. It merged into the city of Hamamatsu, which continues the relationship.

Chehalis is considered a twin city with adjacent Centralia.

<text>Fords Prairie is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Lewis County, Washington, United States. The population was 2,234 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The area was originally called &quot;Tasunshun&quot;, meaning &quot;resting place&quot;, by the Upper Chehalis tribe, the Quiyaisk. Fords Prairie was named after Judge Sidney S. Ford, Sr. and his wife Nancy, who were among the earliest white pioneers who settled north of the Columbia River in 1846 in what was then a part of Oregon Territory. Receiving permission from the Quiyasik, their Ford Donation Land Claim abutting the Chehalis River became the center of what became known as Fords Prairie, which became an important travelling stop between the Columbia River and Puget Sound.

During the Puget Sound War in 1855, over 200 residents moved to Fort Henness in Grand Mound for 16 months. A temporary school was started at the fort.

Fords Prairie has slowly been annexed by Centralia with the first annexation beginning in 1946. A proposal to incorporate Fords Prairie as a city failed in May 1982. Residents voted 85% against the proposition, an action reported as going &quot;down like a submarine with screen doors&quot;.

The community was notified in late 2024 by the city of Centralia and several Lewis County departments that drinking water within Ford&#x27;s Prairie may be unsafe. Nitrate levels had been recorded as increasing in wells in 2023, leading to additional testing of private well water which confirmed a regional issue. No official announcement of contamination was issued but potential causes that were considered included seepage of bird manure from a local game farm and leaking septic systems.

==Geography==
Ford&#x27;s Prairie is often considered a neighborhood of Centralia, which borders the community to the south. Grand Mound, in Thurston County, borders Ford&#x27;s Prairie to the north. Interstate 5 forms the eastern edge of the CDP, with access from Exit 82 (Harrison Avenue) in Centralia.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Fords Prairie CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 3.27%, are water. The community sits on the east side of the Chehalis River, which flows northwest to the Pacific Ocean at Grays Harbor.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 1,961 people, 785 households, and 588 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 502.0 people per square mile (193.6/km2). There were 820 housing units at an average density of 209.9/sq mi (81.0/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 93.83% White, 0.05% African American, 1.07% Native American, 1.53% Asian, 0.31% Pacific Islander, 1.43% from other races, and 1.78% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.62% of the population.

There were 785 households, out of which 26.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 61.7% were married couples living together, 10.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 25.0% were non-families. 19.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.49 and the average family size was 2.83.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 21.5% under the age of 18, 8.8% from 18 to 24, 20.7% from 25 to 44, 29.3% from 45 to 64, and 19.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 44 years. For every 100 females, there were 92.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.0 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $42,927, and the median income for a family was $47,829. Males had a median income of $34,073 versus $26,344 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $21,610. About 4.2% of families and 7.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 7.9% of those under age 18 and 7.0% of those age 65 or over.

==Arts and culture==
Ford&#x27;s Prairie is the location of the Wesley Everest Gravesite, a National Register of Historic Places listing since 1991.

The community organized the Fords Prairie Grange which became a center point of social activity in the town.

==Parks and recreation==
The Fort Borst Park complex, which includes the Borst Home and Pioneer Park Dog Park, is situated south of the area. The Discovery Trail, opened in 2006, meanders inside the riparian zone next to the Chehalis River, is northwest of the region. The community is home to the Bob Oke Game Farm, a pheasant hunting site funded and overseen by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. The grounds were opened in the 1950s and known as the Lewis County Game Farm.

==Economy==
Fords Prairie&#x27;s economy was based mostly on farming since the community&#x27;s beginnings, with small farm dairy production providing residents with financial security during the Great Depression. The town contained only one shop, the Raish General Store, which provided farming supplies, groceries, and hardware. The Raish store closed in the 1940s, the building eventually becoming home to various businesses.

The community&#x27;s rural economy has been slowly replaced with the addition of the Port of Centralia, businesses such as Safeway, and major retailers located at the Centralia factory outlet center.

==Government and politics==
, Ford&#x27;s Prairie is considered part of Centralia&#x27;s urban growth area. Both the county and city of Centralia are in a joint jurisdictional agreement, which includes determination of public utilities.

Fords Prairie is recognized as being majority Republican. As Fords Prairie is an unincorporated community, there are no defined bounds and the precinct may be incongruous with the census boundaries.

The 2020 election included 14 votes for candidates of the Libertarian Party and 8 votes for write-in candidates.

==Education==
The first school in Fords Prairie was the Lum Schoolhouse, located on the corner of present-day Lum Road and Reynolds Avenue. The community&#x27;s school district, by 1906, served 100 students and was at the time the largest rural school district in Lewis County. A wood, two-story school was constructed in 1916 for $13,000. The schoolhouse, which served students up to 10th grade, expanded in 1925 with a basement and playroom. The home economics class provided extra food to students during the later years of the Great Depression.

The Fords Prairie school district merged with Centralia in 1944 and the schoolhouse burned down in 1945. The community constructed a new school facility in 1947 which included the first kindergarten class in the town.

Centralia High School is located within Ford&#x27;s Prairie.

<text>Morton is a city in Lewis County, Washington, United States. The population was 1,036 at the 2020 census.

==History==

===19th century===
Morton was first settled in 1871 by James Fletcher. It was later named after Benjamin Harrison&#x27;s Vice President, Levi P. Morton, in 1889. Morton was officially incorporated on January 7, 1913.

===20th century===

In July 1924, a large portion of Morton&#x27;s downtown district was decimated in a fire, affecting 18 blocks. Beginning at the Hilts Hotel, the blaze spread and destroyed 19 commercial buildings, including structures deemed fireproof. A new building collapsed and the Arcade Theater and two general stores were in ruins. With the exception of a housing section for railroad employees, residential areas in Morton were spared; only one minor injury was reported. Another fire engulfed the area several years later, setting fire to the post office.

The White Pass Highway (part of U.S. Route 12) was relocated through Morton in December 1967 due to the creation of Riffe Lake behind Mossyrock Dam, which inundated the old route.

===21st century===
The city of Morton voted to leave the Timberland Regional Library district by way of proposition in 2022, leaving the city with no library or supporting library system.

As part of a single-evening act of vandalism towards LGBTQ symbols in June 2023 that also affected Chehalis, Washington, a window and a rainbow bench outside of a business in the city were damaged.

A state audit of Morton&#x27;s government accounts were undertaken into 2024 and revealed a loss of over $937,000. Further investigations produced evidence the loss was misappropriated by the city&#x27;s clerk-treasurer between 2013 into 2021. The city official, who during that time had sole oversight of the city&#x27;s accounts, was suspected of siphoning the money for personal use. The clerk resigned after the city instituted a separation of the combined clerk-treasurer position in 2021 and had not yet faced official charges at the time of the audit&#x27;s release in August 2024.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

==Economy==
Historic sources of revenue in the early days of Morton included logging, harvesting of cascara bark, and mining for cinnabar (mercury ore) in local mines. Morton was once known as the &quot;tie mill capital of the world&quot; in the 1950s. The longest railroad tie dock in the world ran along the railroad tracks east of Morton.

Timber processing and logging are a large component of Morton&#x27;s economy though the community suffered hardships during the loss of timber production due to environmental laws enacted in the late 20th century. , two lumber mills reside in the town.

==Arts and culture==

===Charitable organizations===
Morton&#x27;s downtown arts center is supported by the Fire Mountain Arts Council (FMAC), a non-profit formally incorporated in 2003. The group purchased the Roxy Theater and managed and found funding for the venue&#x27;s restoration efforts that was completed in 2024. The FMAC also manages an art gallery and the Tiller Arts and Events Center in Morton.

===Festivals and events===
The Morton Loggers’ Jubilee is a weekend celebration of the city&#x27;s history of logging, usually held in August. Due to a lack of permanent records, the actual year the jubilee began is unknown, however there are reports of a beginning timeline of 1937 or 1938. The event has been a tradition since the 1940s and is proclaimed as the &quot;granddaddy of all logging shows&quot;. Highlights include the coronation of a Jubilee Queen, lawnmower and bed racing, and competitive logging contests, which continues the original practice of the jubilee to be a &quot;friendly competition between loggers&quot;. A parade, flea market, live music, and street dance performances round out the festivities. In her first homecoming show in Morton, Brandy Clark performed during the 75th anniversary of the event in 2017. Visitors to the city are welcomed with a wooden sculpture of a lumberjack, given the title &quot;Big Ole&quot;, signifying the jubilee&#x27;s importance to the community.

===Historic buildings and sites===
The downtown district is home to the Roxy Theater, first opened in 1938; the first film shown was Thin Ice, starring figure skater Sonja Henie. The movie house was previously the site of another venue known as the Arcade Theater. Having been dormant since 1980, the site was heavily restored beginning in the early 2000s and finished by 2006. The Roxy was fully opened for films and theater productions the following year. A further remodeling effort began during the Covid-19 pandemic, which included an addition to the building used as a backstage, and was completed in 2024. The theater holds live theatrical performances and film viewings. The Roxy is also home to an art gallery.

==Parks and recreation==
Located on Morton&#x27;s east side lies Jubilee Park, home of the Loggers Jubilee. 

Bordering the Tilton River is Gust Backstrom City Park, often home to the city&#x27;s farmer&#x27;s market and was the location of the Old Settlers Museum. The grounds, in 1896, were home to the first schoolhouse built in the town. The park is used by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) to deliver migrating Chinook salmon, circumventing the dams on the Cowlitz River. 

==Politics==
Morton has historically voted Republican although less so than Lewis County as a whole.

The 2020 election included 9 votes for candidates of the Libertarian Party.

==Education==
There are two schools, Morton Elementary and Morton Junior-Senior High. Centralia College East is adjacent to the Junior-Senior High facility.

The Morton-White Pass boy&#x27;s high school basketball team won back-to-back state championships in 2014 and 2015. The first title was achieved during an undefeated season.

==Infrastructure==

The community is among 8 locations that are part of an EV installation project on the White Pass Scenic Byway. The program will stretch from the White Pass Ski Area to Chehalis and is run in partnership with Lewis County PUD, Twin Transit, state government agencies, and local community efforts. The venture began in 2023 from two grants totaling over $1.8 million.

In 2023, Lewis County Transit began offering weekday, direct-route service from Centralia&#x27;s Mellen Street e-Transit Station to the Morton Energy Station. The route, given the moniker &quot;Brown Line&quot;, allows options for commuters to connect to other transit services in western Washington, such as Intercity Transit, RiverCities Transit, and the Cowlitz Tribal transportation system.

===Strom Field Airport===
Strom Field Airport is a single-runway municipal airfield located immediately southeast of the downtown core. Named after Stan T. Strom, a local devotee of aviation, the airport was constructed between 1964 and 1965. The airstrip is in length and is wide. The airport was reported to be home to 6 aircraft and generated a revenue of over $28,000 in a 2010 economic impact analysis. A pilot of a Cirrus SR22 died during a crash in March 2010 when the aircraft, approximately from the airport, clipped trees during an attempted emergency landing due to power loss to an engine.

<text>Napavine is a city in Lewis County, Washington, United States. It is also included in the Centralia, WA micropolitan area. The population was 1,766 at the 2020 census.

==Etymology==
There are a few documented instances regarding the choice for the moniker of Napavine. A mention in the records of the Napavine Historical Society states that a J.W. Cutting merged the name in the 1870s from a Newaukum tribal leader named Napawyna. However, there is consideration that the woman may have taken her name after the newly designated town. Additional sourcing reports that Scottish immigrant James Urquhart, in platting the area, named the settlement Napavine from the Indian word &quot;Napavoon&quot; meaning &quot;small prairie&quot;.

==History==
Settlers began arriving in the Cowlitz area in the early 1850s. In 1883, Urquhart laid out the town and Napavine was officially incorporated as a town on November 21, 1913.

The duel between outlaws David Merrill and Harry Tracy, a convicted murderer, took place outside Napavine in late-June or early-July 1902, leading to Merrill&#x27;s death. The pair were fugitives after escaping from the Oregon State Penitentiary weeks earlier, traveling into Southwest Washington. Merrill was found to have been shot in the back and his body, in a state of decomposition, was discovered by a local Napavine woman and her son while picking berries. The woman, known as Mary Waggoner, later sought to claim the $1,500 reward money based on a dead or alive decree for Merrill by the state of Oregon, but was denied. Waggoner eventually married Merrill&#x27;s brother, Ben, in 1905.

A railroad depot was built in the late 1910s and provided passenger service until 1960. The Napavine Depot continued to serve the area until the station was permanently closed in April 1968 despite local protest. The Northern Pacific Railway station marked the highest elevation on the line between Portland and Seattle.

==Arts and culture==

===Festivals and events===
The city annually hosts a one-day Napavine Funtime Festival which was created in 1973 by a local Jaycees club and has been organized afterwards by two original founding members. The one-day event, which includes a parade, was headlined by a teenage &quot;Princess Napawinah&quot; and was based on an 18th-century Newaukum Tribal leader, Napawyna. In 2023, the festival was called into question by local residents and several local Native American groups, including the Cowlitz Indian Tribe, due to the wardrobe displayed by the princess during the festivities. Petitions and concerns cited that the displays of Native American customs and clothing created a sense of Pan-Indianism and caricature. Doubts were also raised over the veracity of the historical existence of Princess Napawinah as well as her being labeled under a title of European nobility. Due to a combination of the recent contentions of stereotyping and dwindling participation in the event, the city council passed a resolution in August 2023 to give the city oversight over, but not ownership of, the Funtime Festival, with attention to change the theme of the event. In 2024, the parade and festivities were cooperatively organized by the original founding members, a local Lions Club, and the city. The event went without a Native American motif but rather the theme, &quot;Tiger Pride&quot;, after the local high school mascot. 

Napavine hosts a community Easter Egg Hunt and has held an annual Christmas Parade, or Santa Parade, since the 1980s. The procession begins at the Napavine Community Park and courses through the downtown area.

===Tourism===
The Uncle Sam billboard is located on private property within Napavine. Since being erected in the 1960s, the board has been used to display the conservative political opinions of its owners.

==Parks and recreation==
The largest and newest park in the town is the Napavine Community Park located near the downtown section. It includes an amphitheater and skate park. The community also hosts Robert Cook Day Park, also known as the Robert Cook Playground, nestled in a residential area, Near the school district is Mayme Shaddock Park which contains the Jim Haslett Kitchen. The kitchen, completed in 2024, was named in honor of a long-serving councilman and park supporter.

Napavine was considered, in 2009, as the site for the Southwest Washington Regional Equestrian Center, originally planned for Winlock. The REQ Center, as it was also known, was scaled down in cost, purpose, and size. The REQ plan was abandoned, replaced with a proposal for a $15 million multipurpose facility that maintained the focus of an equestrian center. Named the Newaukum Center, the proposed complex was never built due to time constraints for limited state funding and an eventual choice in 2010 to use such funds to construct a sports complex in Centralia.

==Government and politics==

Napavine is recognized as being majority Republican and conservative.

The 2020 election included votes for candidates of the Libertarian Party and 5 votes for write-in candidates.

Bozarth intended to be a one-term mayor, and chose not to run for re-election, citing that public servants should not be long term office holders.

<text>Pe Ell () is a town in Lewis County, Washington, United States. The population was 642 at the 2020 census.

==Etymology==
The community was almost named Mauermanna, named after one of the first non-indigenous settlers in the area, Joe Mauermann, who objected to the honor. The name Pe Ell was chosen and there are several versions of the backstory of the moniker, none of which can be authenticated.

The more accepted version is that the name comes from the attempts of the local Indians to pronounce the first name of an early French-Canadian settler, Pierre Charles, who was an ex-Hudson&#x27;s Bay employee. The account has it that the Indians could not pronounce Pierre, and their attempts turned it into Pe Ell. Another rendition is that P and L were the first initials for Pierre Charles and his Indian wife. Two words were made from the initials: &quot;Pe Ell&quot;. A differing, distinct account is that Charlie Pershell, a Frenchman, settled in the area and married an Indian woman. The Indians found it difficult to sound out the &quot;sh&quot; in Pershell so it became Pe Ell. A separate story mentions the railroad map designated the spot as PL, and that became the name.

==History==
In 1897, the North Pacific Railway built a railroad depot in the town. In 1907, Pe Ell&#x27;s population was around 1,000—larger than it is today. The rich agricultural and timber resources of the region attracted farmers, millworkers, and loggers. By 1909, the town had a bank, three dry goods stores, two general stores, three grocery stores, two barber shops, five saloons, four hotels, a newspaper, a blacksmith, and even an opera house.

Pe Ell was officially incorporated on March 9, 1906.

The community was once home to the Rock Creek sanitorium in the 1930s. Owned by both Lewis and Pacific counties, it was overseen by Dr. Angus MacMillan who also managed a similar tuberculosis hospital in Forest, Washington during the 1940s.

The town lost its water supply, which was provided over the historic Weyerhaeuser Pe Ell Bridge, during the Great Coastal Gale of 2007. The Chehalis River in the Pe Ell area rose during the event, overcoming the bridge and wrecking the water main. The lost pipe system was estimated to have a repair cost of $800,000; the system was installed three years earlier for $1.6 million. The financial costs to replace the bridge and the water supply lines led the Pe Ell community to temporarily consider dissolving the town&#x27;s government.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land. State Route 6 passes through the town and connects it to Chehalis in the east and Raymond in the west.

Begun as a birthday celebration between a local group of young men in 1978, the event consists of entrants buying or building water crafts and floating down the Chehalis River from Pe Ell to Rainbow Falls State Park, where riders can float over a slight waterfall that still remains despite severe flooding damage due to the Great Coastal Gale of 2007.

The Willapa Hills Trail bisects the town.

==Government and politics==

===Local Politics===

The city of Pe Ell has historically used local law enforcement staff, rather than the county sheriff&#x27;s department, for policing. The last Pe Ell town marshal formally retired on April 1, 2019. The town went through several years of intermittent local police coverage, with the county sheriff&#x27;s department filling in when the marshal&#x27;s office was vacant. In 2022, Pe Ell reached an agreement with the city of Morton to outsource police coverage. Since then, the Morton has provided part-time police coverage to the town, along with Mossyrock.

The town is governed by an elected Mayor, along with a town council of 5 members.

Similar to other towns within Lewis County, Pe Ell is recognized as being majority Republican and conservative.

==Education==
The Pe Ell School District provides public education from preschool to 12th grade. The Pe Ell School occupies a single campus and students attend from Pe Ell, as well as the nearby unincorporated communities of Doty and Dryad.

The first public education building erected in Pe Ell was a one-room school constructed in 1882. The schoolhouse was built of split cedar and funded by donations; twelve students attended the first year. The growing population led to the construction of a new, larger Central school beginning in 1892 only to find an expansion necessary in 1913, with a gymnasium added in 1921. A wing for agricultural vocational education was added in 1936, a class popular enough to require an expansion by 1938. The combined Pe Ell elementary and high school, furnished with a library and athletic fields, was completed at the end of 1952.

The Pe Ell high school boys&#x27; basketball team and the girls&#x27; softball team won state championships in 2010. The softball team also won a state title in 2012, and a combined championship with Willapa Valley in 2017.

<text>Toledo is a city in Lewis County, Washington, United States. The population was 631 at the 2020 census.

The community is home to an annual Cheese Days festival that celebrates the town&#x27;s dairy history.

==Etymology==
The area underwent several names during its beginnings, including Plomondon&#x27;s Landing, Warbassport, and Cowlitz Landing, changing roughly once a decade during the mid-1800s. The moniker of Toledo was given in the 1870s and was named by Celeste Rochon after a pioneer side wheel paddle steamer operated by Captain Oren Kellogg of the Kellogg Transportation Company. The boat traveled the Cowlitz River.

==History==
Simon Plomondon (or Plamondon), an employee of the Hudson Bay Company, settled in the area in 1820, taking up a donation land claim, marrying a Cowlitz Indian chief&#x27;s (Chief Schanewah) daughter Thas-e-muth (Veronica) and becoming the first white man to settle in what would later be known as Southwest Washington. Their first child was born in what would become Toledo in 1821. The early inhabitancy was not the first non-Indigenous settlement in the area, as the Pugets Sound Agricultural Company opened and maintained the Cowlitz Farm in 1839, near Toledo. In the mid-1850s during the Puget Sound War, volunteers constructed a blockhouse at Cowlitz Landing amid fears of potential Native American attacks; no combat at the fort took place.

By the 1850s, a settlement known as Cowlitz Landing was formed after passengers of the river began disembarking during their journeys around the area. The landing was approximately southwest of present-day Toledo. The Cowlitz River changed course, eventually removing any remaining signs of the early community, and a new landing was established at the Tokul Creek junction. Another pioneer, Edward D. Warbass, began a port in the area after purchasing a claim in July 1850. The following year he established a post office known as Warbassport and served as a Lewis County treasurer and auditor for several years. In 1879, Captain Kellogg decided the area was conducive to build a town and began to purchase lands with that intent.

Toledo was officially incorporated on October 10, 1892.

==Arts and culture==
The residents of Toledo hold an annual &quot;Big Toledo Community Meeting&quot;, or known locally as the &quot;Big Meeting&quot;, to discuss ideas and plans for future events, to be informed of current projects within the town, and to hear about updates by local community and charitable organizations. The meeting began in 2011 as a way to invigorate the town after a large fire devastated a downtown historic building. Recent festivals and celebrations, such as a Santa Quad Parade and the New Year&#x27;s Eve Giant Cheese Ball Drop, were developed based on proposals from the meeting.
===Festivals and events===
Toledo celebrates the city&#x27;s dairy farming history by hosting an annual Cheese Days festival, usually held in July. The festival began after the opening of a new cheese processing plant in 1919. A fire in 1945 decimated the factory but the yearly ceremonies continued. In 2021, the festival observed the 100th occasion that the event had been held, and it has continued to honor the tradition of providing cheese sandwiches that were first offered at the inaugural Cheese Days celebration. Since 1985, the festival has a grand marshal, titled as the Big Cheese, bestowed to an older and long-term resident of the community as an honor in recognition for their volunteer efforts.

The Mt. St. Helens Bluegrass Festival is held annually in the city and features performances from bluegrass musicians from around the United States, including Appalachia and the Pacific Northwest. The festival is also known for its bluegrass quilting room. First debuting in 1984, the weekend event is usually held in August.

==Politics==

===Voting===
The 2020 election included votes for candidates of the Libertarian Party.

===Government===

Toledo institutes a five-person city council that oversees economic and legislative matters, and an elected mayor that maintains daily oversight of the city and government staff.

==Education==
Public education is provided by the Toledo School District, which serves both the City of Toledo and surrounding population. Campuses for students in elementary, middle, and high school are named after the city.

The first school in Toledo was called the OK School. It was a one-room schoolhouse. Most of the kids that lived out of the town limits had to ride a boat across the river to and from school until the bridge was built. The school district consolidated 33 separate one-room schools in 1922. The school system mascot was the &quot;Indians&quot;, a moniker that would exist for a century. The current middle school was originally the high school until the new high school was built in 1974. While the middle school was being remodeled in 1995, the children were relocated for the year to St. Mary&#x27;s Church and School.

St. Mary&#x27;s Academy, begun in 1920, was a private-school for girls and began on the site of the Saint Francis Xavier Mission that first began in 1838. Despite large enrollment and funding figures in the 1960s, St. Mary&#x27;s shuttered in June 1973 after severe loss of registrations due to negative economic conditions in the region.

The Class of 1988 commissioned a totem pole from a chainsaw artist. This pole was presented to the high school by the class and continues to grace the front entrance. Since 1922, the school has used the &quot;Indian&quot; as the School&#x27;s mascot. The Cowlitz Indian Tribe officially endorsed this mascot by Tribal Council action in February 2019. Artwork in the high school includes two Remington bronzes, an oil portrait of David Ike, last full-blooded Cowlitz Indian and several carvings by indigenous artists. Gary Ike, a long-time supporter of the school and its programs, is honored throughout the school and athletic venues in thanks for his many years of service to the school and community.

In November 2018, the community voted to build a new high school. Using funds from a special state grant and School Construction Assistance Program (SCAP) funding from the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction, the upgraded high school was constructed on the site of the existing school. Expansive construction of the new Toledo High School began in February 2020 and opened in autumn 2021. The school is built around the original gymnasium and features artwork honoring the Cowlitz Indian Tribe. The $25 million construction project was completed in April 2022 followed by a ribbon cutting ceremony, unveilings of Native American artworks, and a performance by the Cowlitz Indian Tribe Drum Group.
In 2021, the school district, required by a Washington state law banning Native American mascots and imagery enacted that year, changed its nickname to the Riverhawks.

===Sports===
The Toledo boys&#x27; baseball team won the 2B state title in 2016.

==Infrastructure==
Approximately north of Toledo is the South Lewis County Airport. Also known as Ed Carlson Memorial Field, the airfield is county owned but managed by a local commission.

<text>Vader is a city in Lewis County, Washington, United States. The population was 629 at the 2020 census.

==Etymology==
The community was platted under the name Kraft and became known as Little Falls after the waterfalls of the same name on Olequa Creek. The name was changed to Sopenah by the Northern Pacific Railway after it refused to recognize the moniker because there was already a Little Falls, Minnesota. The townspeople were unsatisfied with the new name and petitioned the Washington State Legislature to change it to Toronto but several communities with that title already existed in the United States, not solving the concern over naming confusion. A dispute then arose which was resolved by a compromise agreement to name the town after a German resident, and Civil War veteran, named Martin Vader. The town name was changed to Vader by the legislature on March 25, 1913. Vader later moved to California or Florida where a myth began that he did not care for the recognition; later reporting stated that he was proud of the honor.

Twice in the 21st century motions have been made to change the community&#x27;s moniker back to its original name, Little Falls, due to a variety of concerns such as the name of Vader did not encapsulate the meaning of the town, or that the title of Little Falls would be more inviting from a tourism and visitor standpoint. The issue was added to the ballot in 2005 and 2015 to determine voter approval; both attempts failed. In the 2015 vote, 131 residents voted against the change and 73 in favor.

==History==

As Little Falls, the town was incorporated on January 12, 1906. During its peak between 1890 and 1920, Vader hosted over 40 businesses, contained two churches, and had a hospital. Businesses included a bowling alley, an opera house, several saloons, and the Vader Moving Picture Theater.
The seven Olson brothers, notably Ben Olsen of the Ben Olsen House, began the Stillwater Logging and Lumber Company; the company operated a sawmill in Vader beginning in late December 1907, at its peak employing as many as 180 men. Olsen also formed a partnership, the Little Falls Water Company, to supply water to the Little Falls community in the early 1910s.

The Stillwater lumber mill was purchased by Weyerhaeuser in 1914. Despite the facility having a fire suppression system in place by 1915, the mill burned down on the evening of January 11, 1916; damages were estimated between $30,000 and $100,000. The mill was rebuilt but burned down again on the night of September 1, 1918. The fire began from an explosion in the boiler room when new equipment was being installed. Though the plane mill and dry kiln areas survived, the loss of timber and a rail engine were substantial. Damages were estimated at $125,000; the mill had only $35,000 in insurance coverage. A formal announcement was made the following month that the mill would not be rebuilt. The Stillwater timber holdings were sold to the Winlock Lumber Company, however, Stillwater&#x27;s logging operations were briefly resumed in March 1919. One attempt to rebuild the mill was announced in December 1919. The effort did not materialize.

The population may have reached as high as 5,000 residents during its peak. Various disasters and loss of employment led to a decline to the town. In 1914, a clay company burned down. A new, but smaller clay production plant began in 1920 but another fire decimated the facility in 1925.

<text>Winlock () is a city in Lewis County, Washington, United States. The population was 1,472 at the 2020 census. It was named after territorial army general, William Winlock Miller, who briefly resided there. Winlock is mostly famous for having the World&#x27;s Largest Egg, reflecting its former status as a major producer of eggs. Early in its history, Winlock attracted many immigrants from Finland, Germany, and Sweden.

==History==
===Origin===
Winlock began as a Northern Pacific Railroad construction camp called Wheeler&#x27;s Camp in c. 1871. The railroad was then in the process of extending its line from Kalama to Tacoma, Washington. Dr. C. C. Pagett, an early resident, donated the land for the townsite. In 1873, he named it for General William Winlock Miller of Olympia, a man of some renown in the area. Miller had promised to give a school bell to the town if it were to be named after him. The town was incorporated in 1883.

=== Early economy ===
Lumbering was the initial economic driver. A number of sawmills were established beginning in the late 1800s. In the late 1920s there were four mills in operation, employing 350 men and producing over 30 million board feet of fir lumber annually.

Agriculture developed in the early 1900s with the impetus on the raising of poultry and the production of eggs. A branch of the Washington Cooperative Egg &amp; Poultry Association located in the town constructed a large building in the north end of town, near the railroad tracks, around 1920. It housed grain storage bins and poultry processing facilities. The building remains standing today. Several hatcheries were located in the town. More than 750,000 baby chicks were produced during the 1928 season.
In 1922 it was noted in a local newspaper that the only American city that produced more eggs than Winlock was Petaluma, California. In a single weekend in 1923, Winlock shipped 38,400 dozen eggs to New York state. Winlock at that time was touted as the &quot;Egg and Poultry Capital of the World&quot;.

===21st century===
A fire in Winlock&#x27;s downtown area consumed the city&#x27;s historic Warne&#x27;s Drug Store building in late 2022. The structure was built in 1911 but burned down the following year. Rebuilt soon thereafter, the building housed the now-defunct Winlock News and Winlock Phone Company, as well as other various businesses for the next century. At the time of loss, the location was used as a hostel for six years.
An annexation proposal by the city to incorporate Winlock&#x27;s urban growth area (UGA) was dismissed in 2023 by the Lewis County Supreme Court over a combination of protests from residents in the UGA and the questions of statutory and filing periods and connected legal authority. The UGA, formed from a county contract in 2006, is recorded as containing with a population of 335 residents. A citizen-led petition for the proposal to be reviewed by the Washington State Boundary Review Board for Lewis County exceeded the minimum voting requirements and a subsequent unanimous approval of the annexation by the board occurred in August of that year. The annexation was adopted by a majority vote of the Winlock city council that autumn.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. The city grew an additional after the 2023 UGA annexation.

The eastern edge of the Willapa Hills lie to the west. To the east are relatively flat prairies. A notable landmark about four miles west of town is Sam Henry Mountain, elevation , named for an early section superintendent of the Northern Pacific Railroad. Mt. St. Helens, about to the east can be seen from viewpoints around the area. In May 1980, Winlock was covered with about of volcanic ash from the second major eruption of this peak one week after the cataclysmic eruption of May 18.

The church was reopened as a parish of the Saint George Byzantine Catholic Church of Olympia in November 2024 after a foundation formed by local residents purchased the building that summer with the intention to remodel, repair, and preserve the historic church.

====Winlock Egg====
The Winlock Egg was listed as the world&#x27;s largest egg by Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not! in 1989. The current structure is the fourth reincarnation of the original egg.

The first egg was built for a celebration of the opening of the Pacific Highway Bridge over the Columbia River between Washington and Oregon. The idea of an egg came from John G. Lawrence, the manager of the newly formed egg and poultry co-op as a way to represent the growing industry centered in Winlock in the 1920s. During that time farmers in Winlock were shipping as much as a quarter million cases of eggs to market a year.

The first egg was made of an egg shaped wood frame stretched with canvas and painted white. It was mounted onto a truck as part of a parade of floats and vehicles that traveled from Olympia, Washington to Salem, Oregon on October 23, 1923, to celebrate the expansion of trade between Washington and Oregon through the railroad. After the parade, the egg was placed on a platform near the train depot, and has since remained a source of local pride.

The first egg was covered with plaster and measured long, with a maximum diameter of . After 20 years in the elements, the egg had deteriorated and was replaced by a plastic version made by a new company to the area, the Johnny Simpson&#x27;s Plastic Company. This version lasted until 1958 when it fell from its rotted platform and cracked. A fiberglass replacement was made but not installed until 1965. Weighing in at , the fiberglass egg was in length but there were concerns that it was shaped too much like a football. The community created a fenced park, Vern Zander Memorial Park, around the attraction and the egg was labeled with a sign denoting it as the world&#x27;s largest egg.

Another fiberglass replacement egg was installed in 1991. The new sculpture was part of the Winlock Egg Day Parade before it was placed in the Vern Zander Memorial Park on top of a steel support. The egg, in the 21st century, has been painted to reflect certain interests or events, including being depicted as a red, white, and blue American flag after the 9/11 attacks and decorated with the Seattle Seahawks logo in the 2010s.

==Parks and recreation==
The city is home to Winolequa Park, Winlock&#x27;s largest public park. Also known as Winolequa Memorial Park, it began by community volunteer effort in the 1960s and 1970s.

Since 2018, community groups and volunteers install the Winlock Memorial Christmas Tree at Vern Zander Memorial Park during the year end holiday season. , approximately 450 ornaments containing a collection of the names of Winlock residents who have died are hung on the tree as to honor &quot;those who are gone but will never be forgotten&quot;.

Winlock was the planned site for the Southwest Washington Regional Equestrian Center. Also known as the REQ Center, formal planning began in 2006 and the horse arena was to have a seating capacity of over 7,000 people and was estimated to cost between $50 million and $80 million. The equestrian center was projected to present a variety of professional horse and rodeo competitions. An official site was chosen in 2008 but the center&#x27;s placement in Winlock was cancelled that same year after a project manager and a developer were fined after pleading guilty to illegally filling approximately of wetlands at the location. In 2009, the arena was proposed to be moved to Napavine.

The Winlock high school football team won Class B state titles in 1955, 1958, and 1959. Annually, a senior player is chosen to receive the Otis Roundtree Award, name after a local resident who played football for the University of Washington in the 1890s. The tradition started in the 1920s to honor the most inspirational footballer on the team and is considered one of the oldest high school awards still in existence within the state.

==Infrastructure==

Washington State Route 505 begins in Winlock and runs east to Interstate 5 and beyond to the town of Toledo. Highway 603, a former state route, continues north from Winlock to intersect with State Route 6 about 4 miles West of Chehalis.

The Burlington Northern railroad double track line runs through the middle of the town. Union Pacific and Amtrak trains also use these tracks. This line is the only rail connection between Seattle/Tacoma and Portland and supports heavy traffic. Freight service is available here but Amtrak does not stop, with the nearest station being in Centralia.

Winlock began constructing a fiber optic expansion of a regional broadband project in 2023. The initiative is led by a grant of $23.5 million from the Washington State Broadband Office with an additional $2.3 million from a regional communications company. Once completed, the broadband system will be owned by Lewis County. The venture was originally planned to be completed in 2024, but forecasted out to late 2026.

<text>Almira () is a town in Lincoln County, Washington, United States. The population was 318 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The area that would become Almira was first settled in the 1880s by Charles C. Davis who purchased land and erected a small store to serve the few settlers living in the area. With the imminent construction of the Central Washington Railroad (later acquired by the Northern Pacific) through the area in 1889, Davis was approached by land developers Odgers and Reed who were looking to start a town on the site. Upon seeing Davis&#x27; wife&#x27;s given name on the deed, the developers suggested christening the town under her name. Davis&#x27; farm and post office had previously been called &quot;Davisine&quot;.

With the railroad assured, Almira was platted and lots begin to sell quickly. Contractors and businessmen began to build temporary buildings for their stores. The railroad reached Almira in the Fall of 1889, where it would serve as the line&#x27;s temporary terminus before being extended to Coulee City the following summer. Until the road was completed to the Grand Coulee Almira remained the terminus. All trains ran to this point, connections by stage being made to points westward. These factors made the town furiously active but a harsh winter prevented any building boom from taking place, leaving Almira as a collection of temporary shacks until the weather improved.

Despite the end of Almira as a rail terminal, it continued to thrive through 1890 with the establishment of a newspaper and the construction of many new buildings. The town&#x27;s population was 156. In November 1890, Almira citizens voted for prohibition and the city temporarily became the only dry town in the Big Bend Country. After the Panic of 1893, growth in Almira like all across the country, came to a standstill. Most of the undeveloped lots in town were either in foreclosure or completely worthless. This changed in 1900 when the economy began to improve following several years of prosperous wheat harvests.

The next several years saw Almira grow from a temporary village to a more substantial city. In 1902, the city&#x27;s population was 289 only counting citizens living on the platted town site.

Almira was visited by fires twice in 1903. The first on March 21 destroyed several buildings including the office of the &quot;Almira News&quot;. The second fire in October started in the Almira Hotel and was much more destructive, destroying a whole block&#x27;s worth of buildings. These blocks were rebuilt with more permanent brick buildings which still stand today.

Steps were taken towards incorporation in April 1903 but were initially unsuccessful because of disagreements in the town&#x27;s incorporation boundaries. The second try was successful and Almira was officially incorporated on February 1, 1904.

==Geography==
Almira is located at (47.710419, -118.941762).

<text>Creston is a town in Lincoln County, Washington, United States. The population was 213 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Creston sprang up with the arrival of the Central Washington Railroad in 1889. It was so named because of its high altitude; it was thought to be at the highest point (the crest) between Cheney and Coulee City, Washington, along the railroad grade. In the spring of 1890, a town site was platted by H.S. Huson and registered with the state on June 23 of that year. The first structure in town was a small store building moved to the site by Henry Verfurth from the nearby village of Sherman, 5 miles northwest of Creston. A post office was established shortly thereafter whose jurisdiction extended to the Columbia River on the North and the railroad tracks on the South with ten miles East and West. Henry Verfurth was appointed as postmaster. Following the Panic of 1893 and the bankruptcy of the town site owner, Creston remained dormant until a bumper wheat crop in 1897 gave a boost to the regional economy, bringing thousands of new settlers to the region.

The results of the strong harvest were immediate with new businesses, grain elevators, public buildings, churches and the town&#x27;s first bank and newspaper. At the same time, Creston was given a boost by a new road and ferry connecting it to the rich mineral belts in the nearby Colville Indian Reservation. Between 1900 and 1903, Creston&#x27;s population doubled to 102. In August 1902, the last surviving member of the infamous Hole in the Wall Gang, Harry Tracy, was shot at a Creston ranch and killed himself there to avoid capture. Creston was officially incorporated on April 20, 1903.

==Geography==
Creston is located roughly west of Davenport, the county seat. U.S. Route 2 passes through Creston, connecting it to Wilbur a few miles to the west, with which the town shares a school district. Creston is home to an elementary school and the two towns&#x27; middle school, though the Wilbur-Creston High School is located in Wilbur.

Creston is located at the foot of Creston Butte, which lies directly south of the town. The butte rises to above sea level, approximately higher than the town&#x27;s elevation.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.

<text>Davenport is the county seat of and largest city in Lincoln County, Washington, United States. The population was 1,703 at the 2020 census. As the seat of government for the county and its largest population center, Davenport serves as an important hub for business, medical and educational services in Lincoln County.

==History==
Prior to European settlement, the area around what would become Davenport was home to the Lower Band of the Spokane. The location was also along a popular east-west trade route, and the spring at present day Davenport was seen as an oasis and place for rest and camping along the journey.

That trail would eventually bring white settlers to the area, with prospectors passing through on their way to goldfields in Montana. Like the Spokane before them, these settlers used the springs at the present site of Davenport to collect water, rest and camp. The setting of the springs in the otherwise semi-arid region attracted some of these new arrivals to settle at the location, and in 1880 Aloysius Harry Harker became the first non-native permanent settler at the location, with John and Emma Eads Nicholls arriving soon after. The settlement was located at the springs and known as Cottonwood Springs. John C. Davenport founded a separate settlement on higher ground nearby in 1883, which was destroyed by fire the following year. Davenport&#x27;s settlement relocated to Cottonwood Springs, taking Davenport&#x27;s name with it. The city was made the county seat of Lincoln County on December 15, 1896, after an election that had chosen Davenport over then-seat Sprague, which had been destroyed in a fire, and Harrington.

Davenport gained early prominence in the north central part of the Columbia Basin of eastern Washington with the arrival of the Washington Central branch of the transcontinental Northern Pacific Railway (NP) railroad line, which reached Davenport in February 1889. The Seattle Lake Shore &amp; Eastern Railway (SLS&amp;E) arrived later that year. A branch line of the Great Northern Railway (GN) was built to Davenport from Bluestem in the 1920s. Davenport&#x27;s train depot, built in 1889 with the arrival of the railroads, lasted almost 100 years before being demolished in 1988.

Primary State Highway #2 (a.k.a. &quot;Sunset Highway&quot;) closely followed the CW railroad from Coulee City through Davenport to Spokane. The route is now known as U.S. Route 2, but does not follow the original Sunset Highway in many places. Primary State Highway #7 also intersected with PSH #2 in Davenport, and is now part of State Route 28. PSH #22 ran north from Davenport to the Canada–US border near Northport. This is State Route 25 now.

==Geography==

Davenport is located at (47.651157, -118.151627). Davenport itself is largely flat, lying in the shallow valley of Cottonwood Creek, but the surrounding region is characterized by the Channeled Scablands scoured by the Missoula Floods during the last ice age. Davenport lies on the northern edge of the scablands, with more familiar drainage patterns taking over the terrain a few miles to the north of the city. Cottonwood Creek is an example of those more typical drainage patterns, as it flows northwest into the Columbia River at Hawk Creek Bay. Crystal Spring, which helps feed the creek, is located near the center of town.

Davenport is served by U.S. Route 2, which runs through the heart of the city. U.S. Route 2 connects Davenport with the region&#x27;s primary city, Spokane, which is located 35 miles to the east. Two state highways also serve Davenport. State Route 28 has its eastern terminus in Davenport, connecting the city the rural areas to its southwest. State Route 25 has its southern terminus in Davenport, from which it stretches north to the Canadian border.

Davenport is centrally located in the northern wheat belt of the Columbia Basin, where dryland wheat farming on the hills not washed away in the great Missoula Floods some 14,000 years ago, is critical to the agricultural economy of the region. Davenport Union Warehouse and Odessa Union Warehouse operate multiple elevators of varying age and design on the southern part of the city. A few of these structures date to the early days of the city. Davenport still serves as a central collection point for wheat, with most of it shipped out by truck or railcar. While most of the wheat goes to export, some of it does find its way to the ADM flour mills in Spokane and Cheney. Locally grown barley also finds its way to various west coast breweries and other users.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

<text>Wilbur is a town in Lincoln County, Washington, United States. The population was 895 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Just prior to the construction of the Central Washington Railroad line in 1889, no towns existed west of Davenport in Lincoln County. One place along the line, &quot;Wild Goose Bill&#x27;s Ranch,&quot; run by Samuel Wilbur Condit, was assigned a post office by the Federal government. Condit was 62 years old and known throughout the region as Wild Goose Bill when he and another man shot each other to death on January 21, 1895. The town was originally named &quot;Goosetown&quot; in his honor, however, after the local blacksmith&#x27;s wife complained that she would never live somewhere with such a silly name, the town was christened &quot;Wilbur&quot; in 1889.

It had been located on the stage line between Davenport and the Mines in northern Washington and with the speculation of the railroad arriving soon seemed a likely place for a town. The town grew in earnest and was platted in April 1889. With the arrival of the railroad later that year, Wilbur&#x27;s growth increased rapidly with the establishment of bigger hotels, a bank, a lumber mill and countless other businesses. After several failed attempts to incorporate in 1889, Wilbur was officially incorporated on August 11, 1890. The boom had slowed by 1891 and came to a halt with the Panic of 1893. A fire in October 1891 caused damage to the town, killing 4.

Wilbur was brought out of the hard times of the 1890s during a record wheat harvest in 1897 which brought over $1,000,000 to circulation in the town. The construction of a road to Republic then a flourishing mining camp in what was to become Ferry County was expected to increase traffic to Wilbur, but the expected benefit never materialized. After a July 5, 1901, fire destroyed several city blocks, causing $155,000 in damage ($3.9 million in 2017 dollars), a water works was established in 1903. Wilbur was electrically lighted in October 1903 by the Wilbur Electric Company.

Wilbur gained news coverage in July 2007 as a result of crop circles found roughly 10 miles north of town, just off of Highway 2. The origin of these depressions in the wheat crop of local farmer Jim Llewellyn is unknown, and the phenomenon was covered by new stations as well as newspapers. More crop circles were discovered in August 2009. On July 31, 2012, crop circles appeared for the third time in wheat fields near the town.

==Geography==
Wilbur is located in northwestern Lincoln County on U.S. Route 2 approximately south of Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake on the Columbia River. The town is connected by additional highways: State Route 21 continues north to the Keller Ferry and south to Interstate 90 in Washington; and State Route 174 travels northwest to the Grand Coulee Dam.

Wilbur is situated in an oblong basin with Goose Creek, also named for Wild Goose Bill, running through the center of the town, and abrupt, basaltic cliffs, not of very great elevation, on the north and south. At one time this spot was, evidently, a lake. During the construction of U.S. Route 2, the course of Goose Creek was altered, moving its flow southward as it flows to the west, part of the Wilson Creek watershed.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.

==Climate==
Wilbur has a semi-arid climate (BSk) closely bordering a humid continental climate (Dsb), according to the Köppen climate classification system.

<text>Shelton is a city in and the county seat of Mason County, Washington, United States. Shelton is the westernmost city on Puget Sound. The population was 10,371 at the 2020 census. Shelton has a council–manager form of government and was the last city in Washington to use a mayor–commission form of government.

==History==
Shelton was officially incorporated in 1890. The city was named after David Shelton, a delegate to the territorial legislature. The land was previously called &quot;Cota&quot; and was inhabited and managed by the Squaxin Island Tribe, or &quot;People of the Waters&quot;, who had inhabited the land for centuries before contact with white settlers. The land was ceded, along with 4,000 sq. miles of Indigenous land, on December 26, 1854, with the passage of the Treaty of Medicine Creek. After the passage of the treaty, David Shelton and his wife, Frances Shelton, each took a claim of land enabled by the Donation Land Claim Act totaling 640 acres in what would eventually be incorporated as Shelton.

Shelton was once served by a small fleet of steamboats which was part of the Puget Sound Mosquito Fleet. These boats included the &quot;Old Settler&quot;, &quot;Irene&quot;, &quot;Willie&quot;, &quot;City of Shelton&quot;, &quot;Marian&quot;, &quot;Clara Brown&quot;, and &quot;S.G. Simpson&quot;. The economy was built around logging, farming, dairying and ranching as well as oyster cultivation. The Simpson Timber Company mill on Puget Sound&#x27;s Oakland Bay dominated the landscape of the downtown area; the mill was sold to Sierra Pacific Industries in 2015, who are currently building a new mill. Shelton also identified itself as &quot;Christmastown, USA&quot; due to the area&#x27;s cultivation of Christmas trees; the name was later revived for an annual festival.

The Ridge Motorsports Park opened in 2012, and has hosted MotoAmerica and Trans-Am Series races.

<text>Omak ( ) is a city located in the foothills of the Okanogan Highlands in north-central Washington, United States. With a population of 4,860 residents as of 2020, distributed over a land area of , Omak is the largest municipality of Okanogan County and the largest municipality in Central Washington north of Wenatchee. The Greater Omak Area of around 8,229 inhabitants as of the 2010 census is the largest urban cluster in the Okanogan Country region, encompassing most of its twin city of Okanogan. The population has increased significantly since the 1910 census, reporting 520 residents just prior to incorporation in 1911.

The land that is now Omak had been inhabited by various Native American tribes before the arrival of non-indigenous settlers in the early 19th century. The city began to develop after the completion of the Okanogan Irrigation Project affecting the Grand Coulee Dam and other nearby electric facilities. The housing and municipal infrastructure, along with regional infrastructure connecting the new town to other municipalities, were built simultaneously in 1908 supported by the local agricultural industry. The name Omak comes from the Okanagan placename [umák], or the Salishan term &quot;Omache&quot;which is said to mean &quot;good medicine&quot; or &quot;plenty&quot;, referring to its favorable climate, with an annual high of around . Omak acts as the gateway to the Okanogan–Wenatchee National Forest and consists of a central business district and residential neighborhoods.

Omak is a code city governed by a seven-member council and located in the state&#x27;s 4th congressional district. Omak&#x27;s economy is dominated by the primary sector industries of agriculture and forestry, although economic diversification has occurred with sawmills and recreational tourism. Nearby recreational destinations include walking trails, state parks and national forests, such as Conconully State Park, Bridgeport State Park and Osoyoos Lake State Park. The city is home to a weekly newspaper, the &quot;Omak–Okanogan County Chronicle&quot;, and a Wenatchee Valley College campus. Standards for education in Omak are higher than the state&#x27;s average, though drugs and alcohol remain a problem among students. U.S. Route 97 passes through the town, while Washington State Route 155, as well as Washington State Route 215, connects the city to Okanogan and Nespelem, respectively. By road, Omak is located approximately from Seattle, Washington, from Spokane, Washington and from Kelowna, British Columbia.

==History==

===Origin===
The Okanogan Valley was the traditional homeland of the Syilx (also called Okanogan) Native Americans, whose territory extended north into what is now British Columbia. The Syilx acquired horses in the mid-18th century, which helped them expand northward. They first met non-native traders and missionaries in the early 19th century. The Syilx participated in trade fairs held at Kettle Falls and at the mouth of the Fraser River. Trading networks strengthened after the acquisition of horses in the mid-18th century.

In 1811, Fort Okanogan was built by the Pacific Fur Company at the confluence of the Okanogan and Columbia Rivers. The fort&#x27;s ownership passed to the North West Company, then the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Fort Colvile, near Kettle Falls, was another important fur trading outpost. The Okanogan River was used by fur brigades traveling between Fort Okanogan and Kamloops. In the late 1850s this route became known as the Okanagan Trail and was widely used as an inland route to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush.

In the 1850s, European-Americans settled in the area that is now Omak and built houses and inaugurated mining, logging and agricultural activities. As more white settlers arrived, a dispute about land ownership arose between them and the Native Americans.

In response, a treaty stating that an Indian reservation would be formed on some of the disputed land while the European-Americans would own the remaining land was signed. The Indian land was later reduced to about . Colville Indian Reservation was developed around 1872 during the Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant. In 1887, the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, a federally recognized tribe, was formed by executive order from 12 individual bands as per the General Allotment Act of 1887. The federal government decided to move Colville Indian Reservation&#x27;s location west of Columbia River, reducing its area to . It would continue to be reduced for the next 60 years.

Nearby Alma was platted as an unincorporated community around 1886. Alma was renamed Pogue in honor of orchardist J.I. Pogue, and was later renamed Okanoganthe present name. J.I. Pogue was upset that his name was replaced, and requested that surveyor, civil engineer and settler Ben Ross establish another town to the north. Born in Bureau County, Illinois, Ross worked for the Great Northern Railroad shortly before moving to Okanogan County. He decided to found a new community at Pogue&#x27;s proposed location during 1907. It was named Omak, supposedly for the Salishan word &quot;Omache&quot;said to mean &quot;good medicine&quot; or &quot;plenty&quot;and referring to the town&#x27;s favorable climate; although according to William Bright the name comes from the Okanagan placename [umák]. Ross sold various items on the present townsite, trying to have his town recognized, and built a cabin in 1907 to provide shelter for his daughter, son and grandchildrenbecoming one of the first white men to settle the area.

===Growth===
The town began to develop after the completion of the Okanogan Irrigation Project, which was designed to facilitate farming. At this time, many farmers came to Omak looking for homes. Fruits including apples, berries, peaches, plums and watermelons were cultivated after 1910. Omak served as a census-designated place (CDP) in 1910, and incorporated as a city on February 11, 1911. Omak and Okanogan have shared a rivalry in high school sports. During the Great Depression of 1933, several residents of Omak were forced to work in nearby communities. As a result, the United States Bureau of Reclamation promoted work which was available as part of an improvement project at Grand Coulee Dam in nearby Coulee Dam, which employed approximately 5,000 people between 1933 and 1951 when the megaproject ended. By 1950, the city was home to various buildings and structures including the St. Mary Mission church, which satisfied residential needs.

In the 1910s, Omak was chosen as the location for a sawmill to expand economic growth. Omak Fruit Growers controlled the mill and a nearby orchard processing factory. The Biles-Coleman Lumber Company bought out the organization and built a sawmill outside municipal boundaries on the nearby Omak Mountain in 1924. A secondary sawmill was constructed in the Omak area. The company and their mills were purchased in 1975 by Crown Zellerbach and thus an associated organizationCavenham Forest Industriesacquired the mills. The company ultimately went bankrupt, and in response, employees purchased the mill for 45 million dollars and renamed it Omak Wood Products in an attempt to save their jobs. Omak Woods Products&#x27; payroll decreased to 480 in the early 1990s and later went bankrupt themselves, along with Quality Veneer, who later owned the property for 19 million dollars until 2000. The Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation later purchased the mill for 6.6 million dollars, having closed in 2009 because of low demand, ending over 130 jobs. As of 2013, there are proposals to reopen the mills during the summer season. The mill has since partially burned down in the Cold Springs Fire on September 8, 2020.

The Okanogan River, a tributary of the Columbia River, flows through the central portion of the city, and receives Omak Creek from the east just outside municipal boundaries. Known for its balancing Omak Rock, the Omak Lake above sea levelis the largest saline endorheic lake in Washington. The Crawfish Lake is located about northeast of Omak at the border of the Colville Indian Reservation and Okanogan–Wenatchee National Forest. The forest comprises varied terrain and several mountain peaks.

Omak is a planned city. Throughout the 20th century, Ross designed what would become the city of Omak. Within a year of its establishment, the town had a central business district with a public bank and hotel supported by the local agricultural industry. The town was provided with a post office, previously known as &quot;Epley&quot;. Ross founded Omak School District in 1906; soon after this its first school, Omak Schoolhouse, was built. In 1910, a meat market, hardware shop, law office, stationery and confectionery store were constructed in Downtown Omak. A steel bridge built the following year collapsed into the Okanogan River upon initial use. It was quickly rebuilt with no further problems.

<text>Oroville is a city located in the northern bulk of the Okanogan Highlands in north-central Washington, United States. Oroville is a member municipality of Okanogan County, Washington situated between Omak and Penticton. The population was 1,795 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Oroville was first settled by European settlers in the late 1850s and known as &#x27;rag town.&#x27; The settlement was named Oro, after the Spanish word for gold, in 1892 after the surrounding gold mines and in an attempt to attract prospectors and merchants. The Post Office objected to the name &quot;Oro&quot; because a town was already named &quot;Oso&quot; in Washington, so the name was changed to Oroville, in 1909. Oroville was a stop along the Spokane Falls and Northern Railway line from British Columbia to Spokane, via Molson and Chesaw. In 1914 a third branch south to Wenatchee was constructed to avoid the steep inclines on the original Spokane track.

Passenger train service to Oroville was operated by the Great Northern Railway until July 14, 1953, with freight operations continuing later.

Oroville started to become a tourist location in the mid-2000s, large condo developments were proposed. After peaking in 2005–07, the city’s economy has suffered since the Great Recession of 2008. Oroville is home to the Dorothy Scott Airport, an international municipal airport with U.S. Customs check, located two miles outside of the town center. The airport opened in August 1937.

==Geography==

Oroville is located south of the Canada–US border, and features an official crossing into Osoyoos, British Columbia. It is located at the south end of Osoyoos Lake, which empties into the Okanogan River on the east side of the town; the town is bound to the west by the Similkameen River. U.S. Route 97 runs through Oroville.

<text>Pateros is a city in Okanogan County, Washington, United States. The population at the 2020 census was 593.

==History==

Pateros was originally established as Ive&#x27;s Landing in around 1886 by Lee Ives. Ives began farming the area near the confluence of the Methow and Columbia Rivers, which was populated by a small band of Native Americans and around 20 Chinese miners. Ives also built an 18-room hotel at the town site and operated a ferry crossing. The first post office was built in 1895.

In 1900, Charles Nosler acquired most of the townsite. When he visited the site, he noticed the presence of numerous ducks in the area, which reminded him of his visit to the town of Pateros in the Philippines, and so he renamed the town to Pateros. The name is derived from &quot;pato&quot;, the Spanish word for duck, which Pateros is known for. In 1903, the city consisted of four commercial establishments and nine residences and the town was sold to J.C. Steiner. Steiner vigorously promoted the town, making Pateros the principal rail shipping point between Oroville and Wenatchee. Pateros was officially incorporated on May 1, 1913.

In 1962, the Federal Power Commission granted the Douglas County Public Utility District a 50-year license to build and operate Wells Dam about 8 miles downstream of Pateros. Construction of the dam would flood much of the original city. The Pateros City Council accepted an offer to relocate the town, and the PUD spent about on moving or demolishing buildings and improving the town&#x27;s infrastructure. Wells Dam went into operation in 1967. Despite relocation of the city, the population dropped by almost a third from 1960 to 1970.

Much of Pateros was destroyed by the Carlton Complex wildfire on July 17 and 18, 2014. No injuries or fatalities were reported, but at least 95 homes in the area were reported destroyed, along with at least one business.

<text>Tonasket is a city in Okanogan County, Washington, United States. The population was 1,103 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Tonasket was officially incorporated on December 16, 1927. It is named after Chief Tonasket of the Okanogan people, a local leader from this area who assumed the status of grand chief of the American Okanogan after the drawing of the Canada–United States border by the Oregon Treaty of 1846, assuming a leadership role in Okanogan territory formerly held by Chief Nicola who lived north of the border.

Tonasket is a city located along the eastern bank of the Okanogan River in north-central Okanogan County, Washington. U.S. Highway 97, the main north–south highway through central Washington, bisects the city on its way north to the Canada–US border approximately twenty miles away. Washington State Route 20 turns east of 97 at 6th St, and continues running across the state. The city is bordered on the north by Siwash Creek, on the south by Bonaparte Creek, and on the west by the Okanogan River.

Tonasket, which has been the site of a U.S. post office since 1901, was platted in 1910 and incorporated in 1927. It serves as a hub for agricultural and forestry industries in north central Okanogan County. It is the location of three major fruit storage and processing facilities and the offices of the Tonasket Ranger District of the Colville National Forest.

Many descendants of pioneer families still reside in Tonasket and the surrounding areas and are interested in preserving and sharing the history of their heritage. A son of one of those pioneer families, Walter H. Brattain, grew up on a cattle ranch near Tonasket, attended Tonasket schools and shared the 1956 Nobel Prize for Physics (with William Shockley and John Bardeen) for the invention of the transistor.

In 1973, Michael Pilarski of the Friends of the Trees Society organized a faire in Tonasket that sought to help community members provision and sell excess produce and goods before the winter months. This faire has become known as the Okanogan Family Barter Faire and attendees buy, sell, and trade art and handicrafts, vintage clothing, and homegrown produce and can learn about sustainable farming techniques and herbal remedies while enjoying live music and entertainment. The annual event draws in thousands of visitors from around the region and has been described as a celebration of sustainable living and communal ties.

<doc id="138112" wikidata="Q1506800" url="?curid=138112" title="Twisp, Washington">
<text>Twisp is a town in Okanogan County in north central Washington, which sits at the confluence of the Twisp and Methow rivers. The population was 919 at the time of the 2010 census and increased to 992 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
On July 30, 1897, Henry C. Glover platted a town in the Methow Valley he called Gloversville, in which a small store and post office were soon established. In 1898, Glover became postmaster of the town, which was now called Twisp, the origin of which is unclear. The common explanation is that it comes from the Okanagan placename &quot;txʷəc&#x27;p&quot;, which possibly translates to wasp, yellowjacket, or the sound made by a wasp. On June 29, 1899, Amanda P. Burgar platted the town of Twisp adjacent to the original Gloversville site, which was thereafter considered part of Twisp.

Twisp soon contained a population of miners and ranchers who were supported by many local businesses, including a drug store, a bank, a hotel, two saloons and a Methodist church. The Methow tribe was also a common sight, who continued to camp in their traditional sites and traded with the settlers. On August 6, 1909, the town was incorporated and elected its first officers. One of the first issues the five-member town council faced was liquor licenses for the two saloons, and a 1910 election was held to determine whether Twisp would implement Prohibition. The saloons served free drinks on election day, which allegedly all 88 voters partook in, and Prohibition was rejected by a vote of 56–32. In 1911, electricity was brought to Twisp and the first movie house opened. On January 15, 1912, the Twisp School, constructed at a cost of $12,109.68, opened its doors.

Twisp was largely built of wood and shortly after midnight on July 24, 1924, a fire broke out in downtown Twisp, which burned down two houses and 23 buildings. Only the Filer and McAlister grocery store and the Commercial Bank&#x27;s vault survived within the fire zone, which were both built of red brick.

In 1940, a $50,000 addition to the Twisp School building was completed, which included a library, study hall and gymnasium, and the Twisp High School was relocated to a new wing.

By the early 1940s, logging was a large business in Okanogan County and Ernest and Otto Wagner, a father and son team, owned the second largest operation. After their Okanogan mill burned in 1943, they eventually moved all their operations to Twisp and in 1963 a local newspaper reported that &quot;its payroll [was] the life blood of the biggest per cent of the people, not only of Twisp but of the entire Methow Valley.&quot;

In 1948, the Columbia River and its tributaries, including the Twisp and Methow rivers, flooded and the damage in the Methow Valley was estimated to be $4 million, which lost power, telephone service, all its bridges and multiple houses.

The opening of the North Cascades Highway in 1972 brought an influx of full-time resident retirees and seasonal recreationalists, which led to an increase of jobs. In 1973, a new high school located between Twisp and neighboring Winthrop was completed and that year&#x27;s class was the last to graduate from Twisp High School, which was then abandoned and sat vacant for five years. In 1979, the building reopened as the Methow Valley Community Center.

In 2009, the vacant ranger station in Twisp was converted to a campus (entitled TwispWorks) where local businesses, community organizations, artists and producers could operate.

Twisp, along with several neighboring towns in Okanogan County, was evacuated in August 2015 as a result of the Okanogan Complex Fire. Three firefighters were killed while battling one of the complex&#x27;s fires near Twisp on August 19.

<text>Winthrop is a town in Okanogan County, Washington, United States. It is east of Mazama and north of Twisp. The population was 394 at the 2010 census, and increased to 504 at the 2020 census. Winthrop adopted an Old West theme for its downtown architecture in 1971 to prepare for the opening of the North Cascades Highway.

==History==

Native Americans, including the Methow people, were the first inhabitants of Winthrop, with evidence of human habitation at least 8,000 to 10,000 years before present. They lived along the banks of the Methow and Chewuch rivers, where they harvested camas root and berries, fished, and hunted. The Methow had seasonal camps and returned annually to the upper valley in the summer once they acquired had horses in the 18th century. The Columbia Plateau peoples, including the Methow and Syilx, established routes over Cascade Pass to trade with Coast Salish tribes in modern-day Skagit Valley. The population of the Methow people and other Columbia Plateau tribes were devastated by smallpox epidemics by the 19th century. The tribes under the leadership of Chief Moses were assigned by the federal government to the Columbia Reservation in 1879, which included the Methow Valley.

The Columbia Reservation was dissolved by the federal government in 1883 to allow for white settlement of the Methow Valley, which was opened on May 1, 1886. The Methow people were then moved further east to the Colville Indian Reservation. The first white residents of the valley were brothers Tom and Jim Robinson, who had a hunting camp at the confluence but later left. A homestead near the modern-day town was claimed in 1887 by James Sullivan and Louisa Sullivan, who built the first hotel in the area; they were followed in 1888 by Walter Frisbee, who established a trading post and blacksmith shop. The Chiliwist Trail between the Okanogan and Methow valleys was the main transportation corridor for the area but was unsuited to wagon travel; it was replaced in 1891 by a pair of new roads funded by settlers in the area that allowed for stagecoach service connecting to Brewster on the Columbia River.

The town of Winthrop was founded in 1890 by local settlers. The namesake, according to U.S. Congressman John L. Wilson, is author and explorer Theodore Winthrop, who had published the memoir &quot;The Canoe and the Saddle&quot; in 1862 after a visit to Washington Territory. The town&#x27;s first trading post and general store was opened in January 1892 by Guy Waring of Boston, who moved with his family to the confluence of the Chewuch and Methow rivers a year before. He took over the Winthrop post office, which had been established on June 18, 1891, and unsuccessfully attempted to rename the town &quot;Waring&quot; despite local backlash. Waring left the Methow Valley for several years during the economic depression to raise $15,000 in funds for a new venture, the Methow Trading Company. His company acquired almost all of the buildings in the town and opened various businesses, including a sawmill, gristmill, and a hotel. Waring built a spacious new home, named the &quot;Castle&quot; by local residents, on a hillside overlooking Winthrop; it now serves as the home of the Shafer Museum.

Gold was discovered northwest of the Methow Valley near in 1892 and caused a gold rush that brought 1,000 people to the small settlement of Barron. Winthrop remained the main hub of the upper valley with an industry centered around cattle ranching, logging, and supplying nearby mines. Waring opened the Duck Brand Saloon in 1891 and instituted unusually strict rules that required drunk patrons to leave and prohibited bartenders from talking to patrons. The saloon was among the only structures to survive a major fire in 1893 that destroyed the town but closed in 1910; it was later converted into the town hall. Owen Wister, Waring&#x27;s former roommate at Harvard University, wrote &quot;The Virginian&quot;, considered the first American western novel, after honeymooning in Winthrop in 1892 and 1898. Waring continued to expand his business with branch stores in several mining towns as well as Pateros and Twisp.

Most of the Methow Valley was incorporated into the Washington Forest Reserve by an executive order signed by President Grover Cleveland on February 22, 1897. The order prevented further settlement and development of the area around Winthrop, but residents protested due to the area&#x27;s existing use for agriculture; it was modified in 1901 to remove the valley from the protected area. The townsite of Winthrop was formally platted by the Methow Trading Company in 1897 and approved by the county government in 1901. A rival town to the south named Heckendorn was platted in 1904 and had several businesses that eroded Waring&#x27;s monopoly on the upper Methow Valley. A new road along the Methow River from Pateros to the town and upper valley was completed by the state government in 1909 using convict labor and modern construction methods. In the 1910s, Winthrop gained telephone service, a newspaper named the &quot;Winthrop Eagle&quot;, a school, and a bank. Waring left the area in 1917 after losing control of the Methow Trading Company and a failed attempt at ranching. He sold his &quot;Castle&quot;, which was used by a local Episcopal Church and later as a private residence. The U.S. Forest Service opened a ranger station in the town that same year.

Winthrop was incorporated on March 12, 1924, and included the downriver settlement of Heckendorn and a plot of land across the Methow River. The town was threatened by major floods of the river in 1916, 1933, and 1948 that destroyed homes and bridges. The U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service opened the Winthrop National Fish Hatchery on the Methow River in 1942, which produced salmon and trout to be stocked at local lakes and released into the river. The area around Winthrop developed into a destination for outdoor recreation in the middle of the 20th century with the opening of several dude ranches and resorts. The Sunny M Ranch was established in the 1930s west of the town and expanded under various owners into the Sun Mountain Lodge, which opened in 1968 and encompasses and a luxury hotel.

The first plans to build an automobile road across the North Cascades from Bellingham Bay to the Columbia River were approved by the state legislature in 1893. Construction of the final across the mountains did not begin until 1961 and was opened to traffic on September 2, 1972. In anticipation of the new highway and the projected tourist traffic through the town, a large-scale remodeling project was approved in 1971 with funding from local businesses organized by sawmill operator Otto Wagner and his wife Kathryn. A two-block section of downtown was rebuilt to use 1890s Old West architecture, including false fronts and a wooden boardwalk; by September 1972, 22 buildings had been remodeled. The early design work was contracted to Robert Jorgensen, one of the designers of the Bavarian theme town in Leavenworth, and the project was estimated to cost over $350,000. A design review board was established to maintain the architectural theme, enforced by a &quot;Westernization&quot; ordinance. The wooden façade of the Winthrop Emporium, a major tourist store, was destroyed in a fire in November 1993 and rebuilt the following year. The town&#x27;s landmark bell was saved from the fire.

Plans to build an open pit mine for copper as well as a ski resort near Mazama were announced in the 1970s but never realized. The town later annexed southwest of the Methow River that would include new residential areas and an industrial zone.

Winthrop lies in western Okanogan County at the confluence of the Methow and Chewuch rivers in the Methow Valley. The town is in the eastern foothills of the Cascade Mountains at an elevation of . The Okanogan–Wenatchee National Forest and state-managed Methow Wildlife Area surround the Methow Valley.

==Arts and culture==
===Attractions===
Winthrop is known for the American Old West design of all its buildings, making it a tourist destination. The town theme idea was inspired by the example of Leavenworth, Washington, which in turn was heavily based on Solvang, California. Winthrop and the surrounding area has of groomed cross-country skiing trails. The network radiates out from the nearby community of Mazama. Events include the Winthrop Rhythm and Blues Festival, the Methow Valley Chamber Music Festival, and the Labor Day Rodeo. The town is home to Three Fingered Jack&#x27;s, which claims to be the &quot;oldest saloon in Washington&quot;. It opened in 1972 but was cited by the state government for use of the word &quot;saloon&quot;; the term&#x27;s use at bars was legalized by the state legislature in 1979.

===Media===

The &quot;Methow Valley News&quot; is the official newspaper of record for the town government and is published weekly in Twisp. It was founded in 1903 and had a circulation of 3,400 in 2013. The &quot;Methow Valley Journal&quot;, also known as the &quot;Winthrop Journal&quot;, was published in Winthrop by Bill Brinkerhoff from 1912 to 1942.

Winthrop&#x27;s public library is operated by NCW Libraries, a regional system that serves three counties in Central Washington. The original library was a small building at Mack Lloyd Park that was routinely overcrowded and had the highest per-capita use in the system. Plans to build a larger library were led by a non-profit organization that formed in 2017 to raise funds for the project. The Winthrop Library opened on June 11, 2022, and is owned by the town government. The building has six times more floor space than the former library and includes public art, meeting rooms, and a kitchen.

==Education==

The town is served by the Methow Valley School District, which was established from a consolidation of the Twisp and Winthrop school districts in 1973. The school district&#x27;s campus, located between the two towns, comprises Liberty Bell Junior-Senior High School and Methow Valley Elementary.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

Winthrop is bisected by State Route 20, also known as the North Cascades Highway, which closes annually during the winter months between Ross Dam near Diablo and Silver Star Creek near Mazama. State Route 20 follows Riverside Avenue through the town and crosses the Methow River on a truss bridge that was built in 1929. The highway connects Winthrop to North Cascades National Park and the Skagit Valley to the west and Omak to the east. In 2023, State Route 20 carried a daily average of 4,700vehicles at the Methow River Bridge. , there are a total of 459 public parking spaces on streets in Winthrop and in off-street lots. Public transit service is provided by TranGO, which operates buses from Winthrop to Mazama, Twisp, and Pateros every 2 hours with onward connections to other cities in Okanogan County. The route was originally limited to Winthrop, Twisp, and Pateros when it launched in 2016, but was extended to Mazama in 2023.

 is located south of Winthrop and is owned by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). It has a asphalt runway and is listed in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems maintained by the Federal Aviation Administration. The U.S. Forest Service constructed the airstrip in the 1930s and used it as one of the first facilities to train smokejumpers for wildland firefighting beginning in 1939. It was officially designated for smokejumper use in 1945 and had expanded facilities constructed until the primary training center was moved to Redmond, Oregon, in 1981.

===Utilities===

Electric power in the town and surrounding area is provided by the Okanogan County Electric Co-op (OCEC), a nonprofit cooperative that serves northwestern Okanogan County rather than the Okanogan County Public Utility District. OCEC, which is headquartered near Winthrop, was founded in 1939 and primarily purchases its electricity from the federal Bonneville Power Administration, which manages several hydroelectric dams in the Pacific Northwest. The cooperative has a subsidiary that delivers propane for heating and acquired a local internet service provider, Methownet, in 2024. Landline telephone service is provided by CenturyLink, while several carriers have mobile broadband service in the area.

The town government maintains a water system that supplies drinking water to residents and businesses within Winthrop. The town sources its water from a well and has of pipes in its water distribution system, which also includes a storage reservoir and a pump station. Winthrop also sells its water for firefighting but does not regularly supply residents outside of the town limits who rely on their own wells; the town had conservation restrictions on water use during periods of prolonged droughts prior to upgrades to the water system made in the 1990s. The number of customers supplied by Winthrop&#x27;s water system is also managed by the Washington State Department of Health, which places a cap on the number of authorized connections.

Winthrop&#x27;s sanitary sewer system was constructed in 1971 and expanded to by 2015, with service to Sun Mountain Resort and other areas outside the town itself. The wastewater treatment plant south of the town has an aerated lagoon and chlorination system that discharges treated water into the Methow River. The plant was upgraded in 1992 and is planned to be replaced by an adjacent facility with a sludge treatment system by 2027. Solid waste collection is contracted to a private company, WasteWise, that serves most of the Methow Valley; the non-profit organization Methow Recycles is contracted to provide curbside recycling pickup. Winthrop also has a commercial composting facility that opened in 2023 and collects materials from restaurants and residences.

===Healthcare===

The first medical clinic in Winthrop was the Country Clinic, opened in 2000 by a family physician. It was acquired by the Wenatchee-based Confluence Health system in 2015 and renamed to the Methow Valley Clinic. The town&#x27;s nearest general hospitals are Mid-Valley Hospital in Omak and Three Rivers Hospital in Brewster. Three Rivers is operated by a public hospital district that encompasses most of western Okanogan County, including Winthrop.

<text>Ilwaco ( ) is a city in Pacific County, Washington, United States. The population was 1,087 at the 2020 census. Founded in 1890, the city was home to the Ilwaco Railway and Navigation Company along the Long Beach Peninsula, with its core economy based on logging and timber rafting. The city is located on the southern edge of the Long Beach Peninsula, on Baker Bay on the north side of the Columbia River where it meets the Pacific Ocean. It is near the city of Astoria, Oregon, which lies to the southeast on the southern bank of the Columbia.

==History==
Ilwaco, initially given the name Unity, was first settled by Henry Feister in 1851, and was named for the Lower Chinook leader Elwahko Jim, whose indigenous name was [ʔɪlwəkʷo], the son in law of Chief Comcomly. Ilwaco was officially incorporated on December 16, 1890. A narrow gauge railway, Ilwaco Railway and Navigation Company, ran for over thirty years. Similarly to the nearby city of Astoria, Oregon, and the surrounding communities, Ilwaco historically had a significant population of Finnish immigrants.

The railroad ran north up First Street in Ilwaco. A published photo shows the railroad&#x27;s Ilwaco facilities, including a gallows turntable and elevated watering trough, were located on the southwest corner of the intersection of First and Spruce streets. The depot was built nearby on Spruce Street. A siding was built for the Ilwaco Mill and Lumber Company. A published photo shows the passenger depot on the west side of First Street, at a point 14.8 miles (23.8 km) from the Ilwaco Depot to Nahcotta. The train ran out on the dock in Ilwaco. Floating logs were stored behind log booms on the west side of the Ilwaco dock. At some point after 1890, First Street had been covered with wooden planks, and remained so until 1916, when it was paved over. By 1915, a published photo shows more businesses along First Street.

A fire at the Ilwaco Landing at the Port of Ilwaco began on the morning of January 22, 2024 which engulfed a dock, destroyed a receiving facility, and burned an estimated 600 crab pots. The conflagration began a few days before the beginning of the fishing season.

Ilwaco&#x27;s early economy was based on the extraction of natural resources, such as timber production, eventually building up as a sawmill and fishing community known for large seafood catches. One fish processing business, in 2023, accounted for 10% of the state&#x27;s non-treaty commercial harvest, but the 2024 fire at the port halved overall production in the community, leaving the city with one operational receiving facility.

In addition to the city&#x27;s logging and fishing industry, Ilwaco has a history as a cranberry producer, with cranberry bogs located immediately north of its downtown.

<doc id="138118" wikidata="Q1008919" url="?curid=138118" title="Long Beach, Washington">
<text>Long Beach is a city in Pacific County, Washington, United States. The population was 1,688 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Long Beach began when Henry Harrison Tinker bought a land claim from Charles E. Reed in 1880. He platted the town and called it &quot;Tinkerville.&quot; Long Beach was officially incorporated on January 18, 1922. From 1889 to 1930, a narrow-gauge railroad called the Ilwaco Railway and Navigation Company ran up the whole peninsula.

The Long Beach depot was built between First and Second Streets on the east side of the track, which ran north along &quot;B&quot; Street. Two hotels were constructed near the depot by Tinker and later the Hanniman family; the latter was destroyed in a fire on December 6, 1914. The Driftwood Hotel was another common Long Beach destination.
The boardwalk area near the station was known as &quot;Rubberneck Row.&quot; Businesses existing in August 1911 that can be identified along Rubberneck Row from photographs (see images in this article) include, on the west side of the tracks, an establishment advertising &quot;Baths&quot; (possibly the Crystal Baths, an indoor swimming pool), Milton York Candies, a &quot;Postal Shop,&quot; and a soda fountain just across from the station advertising &quot;Milk Shake.&quot; A somewhat earlier photograph shows a sign for a livery stable immediately to the west across the tracks from Tinker&#x27;s Hotel, followed (proceeding southwards) by a barber shop, &quot;Vincent&#x27;s Souvenirs,&quot; and &quot;The Candy Man&quot;. A banner stretching above the tracks advertises a restaurant. The photo published by Feagans shows it was produced by H.A. Vincent, Ilwaco and Long Beach, who was probably the owner of Vincent&#x27;s Souvenirs.

==Geography==
Long Beach is located on the Long Beach Peninsula. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. It is 28 miles long.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Long Beach and the Long Beach Peninsula have a moist (in winter), cool warm-summer mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;), with cool, but long, dry summers and mild winters. Both extreme heat and extreme cold are rare. The record high temperature is on August 10, 1981, and June 27, 2021, and the record low is on December 8, 1972. Long Beach records nearly of rainfall annually. Snow is far less common than rain, but can happen every once in a while.
===Earthquake and tsunami vulnerability===

If a magnitude 9.0 earthquake were to hit the Cascadia subduction zone, emergency planners estimate the first tsunami waves could hit Long Beach 20 to 25 minutes later.

At a December 2016 open house, the city government presented initial plans for a proposed berm which could potentially accommodate 850 persons. The structure would have had a &quot;modified prow,&quot; much like a ship looking out to sea. The shape was also designed to withstand the backwash from a tsunami. The total cost was estimated at $3.4 million, of which the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was to pay 75%, the Emergency Management Division of Washington State 12.5%, and the City of Long Beach 12.5%. The project was abandoned in 2017 after new scientific reports indicated it was designed at least too short to withstand a worst-case tsunami.

<doc id="138124" wikidata="Q1510158" url="?curid=138124" title="Tokeland, Washington">
<text>Tokeland is a census-designated place (CDP) in Pacific County, Washington, United States. The population was 158 at the 2020 census, a slight increase from 151 at the 2010 census. It is located on the north side of Willapa Bay near the Shoalwater Bay Indian Reservation.

The town was named after Chief Toke, an chief of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe during the 19th century.

==History==
Tokeland is named after Chief Toke of the Shoalwater Bay Tribe. Toke made the area a summer home for himself and his family, and his presence was first documented there by Lieutenant John Meares after Toke approached Meares&#x27; ship in his canoe at the mouth of Willapa Bay in 1788.

In 1854, J. F. Barrows settled on Toke Point, but left only a few years later. No other known settlers appeared in the area until the arrival of George Brown in 1858. In 1885, Brown&#x27;s daughter Lizzie, and her husband, William Kindred, built a home that became the Kindred Inn, and eventually as the Tokeland Hotel. When the town&#x27;s first post office was established in 1894, the Kindreds operated it, and continued doing so for 17 years. Lizzie Kindred was also partial owner of the Tokeland Oyster Company when it opened in 1905.

Tokeland became a popular enough destination that in 1910, a group of investors from Portland, Oregon sought to develop an amusement park there that would resemble Coney Island, although these plans never materialized.

Similarly to North Cove and other towns on the north side of Willapa Bay, coastal erosion became a serious concern for Tokeland. This, combined with the overall economic pressure affecting the nation during The Great Depression, caused a decline in the area&#x27;s tourism industry in the 1930s and 1940s. The area&#x27;s economy received a small boost starting in the 1950s, as recreational boating and fishing, combined with a surge in once-dwindling oyster harvests, rekindled many businesses. This led to the Port of Willapa Harbor making many improvements to Tokeland, including the 1974 addition of a new jetty, moorage, boat ramp, timber seawall, and fish buying station.

===Tsunami evacuation tower===

The Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe built a tsunami evacuation tower in 2022. The freestanding structure was built at a cost $5 million, $1.2 million supplied by the tribal council and an additional $3.8 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The tower is considered the first of its type in the United States. In honor of tribal elder Lee Shipman who guided the project to completion, the council bestowed the tower the nickname, &quot;Auntie Lee&quot;.

==Geography==
Tokeland is located in Willapa Bay, by the mouth of the Cedar River. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 0.5 square miles (1.3 km2), all of it land.

===Tsunami and inland flooding===
During early talks to build a tsunami evacuation tower, studies were undertaken by the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe, in conjunction with several local, state, and federal agencies, that determined the Tokeland area could be hit by a tsunami within a range of 10 to 22 minutes after an ensuing high-magnitude earthquake.

Construction on the tsunami evacuation tower, which is the first of its kind in the United States, was finished in 2022. It was nicknamed &quot;Auntie Lee Tower&quot; in honor of Tribal elder Lee Shipman who led the Tribe&#x27;s effort to obtain funding and build the tower.
