<text>Walker Smith Jr. (May 3, 1921 – April 12, 1989), better known as Sugar Ray Robinson, was an American professional boxer who competed from 1940 to 1965. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990. He is often regarded as the greatest boxer of all time, pound-for-pound, and is ranked as such by BoxRec as of December 2024.

Robinson was a dominant amateur, but his exact amateur record is not known. It is usually listed as 85–0 with 69 knockouts, 40 in the first round. However it has been reported he lost to Billy Graham and Patsy Pesca as a teenager under his given name, Walker Smith Jr. He turned professional in 1940 at the age of 19 and by 1951 had a professional record of 129–1–2 with 85 knockouts. From 1943 to 1951 Robinson went on a 91-fight unbeaten streak, the sixth-longest in professional boxing history behind Pedro Carrasco with 93, Jimmy Wilde with 95, Buck Smith with 102, Packey McFarland with 104, and Young Griffo with 107. Robinson held the world welterweight title from 1946 to 1951, and won the world middleweight title in the latter year. He retired in 1952, only to come back two-and-a-half years later and regain the middleweight title in 1955.

He then became the first boxer in history to win a divisional world championship five times (a feat he accomplished by defeating Carmen Basilio in 1958 to regain the middleweight championship). Robinson was named &quot;fighter of the year&quot; twice: first for his performances in 1942, then nine years and over 90 fights later, for his efforts in 1951. Historian Bert Sugar ranked Robinson as the greatest fighter of all time and in 2002, Robinson was also ranked number one on &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;80 Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years&quot;. He was named the best boxer of all time, pound for pound, by the International Boxing Research Organization (IBRO) in both of its all-time ratings, in 2006 and 2019.

Renowned for his classy and flamboyant lifestyle outside the ring, Robinson is credited with being the originator of the modern sports &quot;&quot;. After his boxing career ended, Robinson attempted a career as an entertainer, but it was not successful. He struggled financially until his death in 1989. In 2006, he was featured on a commemorative stamp by the United States Postal Service.

==Early life==
Robinson was born Walker Smith Jr. in Ailey, Georgia, to Walker Smith Sr. and Leila Hurst. Robinson was the youngest of three children; his eldest sister Marie was born in 1917, and his other sister Evelyn in 1919. His father was a cotton, peanut, and corn farmer in Georgia, who moved the family to Detroit where he initially found work in construction. According to Robinson, Smith Sr. later worked two jobs to support his family—cement mixer and sewer worker. &quot;He had to get up at six in the morning and he&#x27;d get home close to midnight. Six days a week. The only day I really saw him was Sunday... I always wanted to be with him more.&quot;

His parents separated, and he moved with his mother to Harlem at the age of 12. Robinson originally aspired to be a doctor, but after dropping out of DeWitt Clinton High School (in the Bronx) in ninth grade, he switched his goal to boxing.

When he was 14, he attempted to enter his first boxing tournament, but was told he first needed an AAU membership card—which he could not legally procure until he was 16. He circumvented the AAU&#x27;s age requirement by using an ID card from a youth named Ray Robinson, who had quit boxing. So, Walker began his amateur fighting career under that name—and it stuck. Later, when a lady in the audience at a fight in Watertown, New York, said he was &quot;sweet as sugar,&quot; the name &quot;Sugar Ray Robinson&quot; was born.

Robinson idolized Henry Armstrong and Joe Louis as a youth, and actually had lived on the same block as Louis in Detroit when Robinson was 11 and Louis was 17. Outside the ring, Robinson got into trouble frequently as a youth, and was involved with a street gang. He married at 16. The couple had one son, Ronnie, and divorced when Robinson was 19.

He reportedly finished his amateur career with an 85–0 record with 69 knockouts – 40 coming in the first round, though this has been disputed. He won the New York Golden Gloves featherweight championship in 1939 (defeating Louis Valentine on points in 3 rounds), and the New York Golden Gloves lightweight championship in 1940 (defeating Andy Nonella by KO in 2).

==Boxing career==

===Early career===
Robinson made his professional debut on October 4, 1940, winning by a second-round stoppage over Joe Echevarria. Robinson fought five more times in 1940, winning all, four by knockout. In 1941, he defeated world champion Sammy Angott, future champion Marty Servo, and former champion Fritzie Zivic. The Robinson-Angott fight was held above the lightweight limit, since Angott did not want to risk losing his lightweight title. The Zivic bout, held at the Madison Square Garden, drew a crowd of 20,551—one of the largest in the arena to that date. Robinson won the first five rounds, according to Joseph C. Nichols of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, before Zivic came back to land several punches to Robinson&#x27;s head in the sixth and seventh. Robinson controlled the next two, and had Zivic hurt in the ninth. After a close tenth round, Robinson was announced as the winner on all three scorecards.

Robinson knocked out Zivic in the tenth round in a January 1942 rematch, only the second time Zivic had been counted out in more than 150 fights. Robinson knocked him down in the ninth and tenth rounds before the referee stopped the fight. Zivic and his corner protested the stoppage; James P. Dawson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated &quot;[t]hey were criticizing a humane act. The battle had been a slaughter, for want of a more delicate word.&quot; Robinson then won four consecutive bouts by knockout, before defeating Servo in a controversial split decision in their May rematch. After winning three more fights, Robinson faced Jake LaMotta, who would become one of his more prominent rivals, for the first time in October. He defeated LaMotta by a unanimous decision, although he failed to get Jake down. Robinson weighed compared to 157.5 for LaMotta, but he was able to control the fight from the outside for the entire bout, and actually landed the harder punches during the fight. Robinson then won four more fights, including two against Izzy Jannazzo, from October 19 to December 14. For his performances, Robinson was named &quot;Fighter of the Year&quot;. He finished 1942 with a total of 14 wins and no losses.

Robinson built a record of 40–0 before losing for the first time to LaMotta in a 10-round re-match. LaMotta, who had a weight advantage over Robinson, knocked Robinson out of the ring in the eighth round, and won the fight by decision. The fight took place in Robinson&#x27;s former home town of Detroit, and attracted a record crowd. After being controlled by Robinson in the early rounds LaMotta came back to take control in the later. After winning the third LaMotta fight less than three weeks later, Robinson then defeated his childhood idol: former champion Henry Armstrong, whom he only fought because the older man was in need of money. Robinson later stated that he carried the aged former champion.

On February 27, 1943, Robinson was inducted into the United States Army, where he was again referred to as Walker Smith. Robinson had a 15-month military career. Robinson served with Joe Louis, and the pair went on tours with the Special Services division where they performed exhibition bouts in front of U.S. Army troops. Robinson got into trouble several times while in the military. He argued with superiors who he felt were discriminatory against him, and refused to fight exhibitions when he was told African American soldiers were not allowed to watch them. In late March 1944 Robinson was stationed at Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn, waiting to ship out to Europe, where he was scheduled to perform more exhibition matches. But on March 29, Robinson disappeared from his barracks. When he woke up on April 5 in Fort Jay Hospital on Governor&#x27;s Island, he had missed his sailing for Europe and was under suspicion of deserting. He himself reported falling down the stairs in his barracks on the 29th, but said that he had complete amnesia, and he could not remember any events from that moment until the 5th. According to his file, a stranger had found him in the street on April 1 and helped him to a hospital. In his examination report, a doctor at Fort Jay concluded that Robinson&#x27;s version of events was sincere. He was examined by military authorities, who claimed he suffered from a mental deficiency. Robinson was granted an honorable discharge on June 3, 1944. He later wrote that unfair press coverage of the incident had &quot;branded&quot; him as a &quot;deserter&quot;. Robinson maintained his close friendship with Louis from their time in military service, and the two went into business together after the war. They planned to start a liquor distribution business in New York City, but were denied a license due to their race.

Besides the loss in the LaMotta rematch, the only other mark on Robinson&#x27;s record during this period was a 10-round draw against José Basora in 1945.

===Welterweight champion===
By 1946, Robinson had fought 75 fights to a 73–1–1 record, and beaten every top contender in the welterweight division. However, he refused to cooperate with the Mafia, which controlled much of boxing at the time, and was denied a chance to fight for the welterweight championship. Robinson was finally given a chance to win a title against Tommy Bell on December 20, 1946. Robinson had already beaten Bell once by decision in 1945. The two fought for the title vacated by Servo, who had himself lost twice to Robinson in non-title bouts. In the fight, Robinson, who only a month before had been involved in a 10-round brawl with Artie Levine, was knocked down by Bell. The fight was called a &quot;war&quot;, but Robinson was able to pull out a close 15-round decision, winning the vacant World Welterweight title.

In 1948 Robinson fought five times, but only one bout was a title defense. Among the fighters he defeated in those non-title bouts was future world champion Kid Gavilán in a close, controversial 10-round fight. Gavilán hurt Robinson several times in the fight, but Robinson controlled the final rounds with a series of jabs and left hooks. In 1949, he boxed 16 times, but again only defended his title once. In that title fight, a rematch with Gavilán, Robinson again won by decision. The first half of the bout was very close, but Robinson took control in the second half. Gavilán would have to wait two more years to begin his own historic reign as welterweight champion. The only boxer to match Robinson that year was Henry Brimm, who fought him to a 10-round draw in Buffalo.

Robinson fought 19 times in 1950. He successfully defended his welterweight title for the last time against Charley Fusari. Robinson won a lopsided 15-round decision, knocking Fusari down once. Robinson donated all but $1 of his purse for the Fusari fight to cancer research. In 1950 Robinson fought George Costner, who had also taken to calling himself &quot;Sugar&quot; and stated in the weeks leading up to the fight that he was the rightful possessor of the name. &quot;We better touch gloves, because this is the only round&quot;, Robinson said as the fighters were introduced at the center of the ring. &quot;Your name ain&#x27;t Sugar, mine is.&quot; Robinson then knocked Costner out in 2 minutes and 49 seconds.

====Jimmy Doyle incident====

In June 1947, after four non-title bouts, Robinson was scheduled to defend his title for the first time in a bout against Jimmy Doyle. Robinson initially backed out of the fight because he had a dream that he was going to kill Doyle. A priest and a minister convinced him to fight. His dream ended up becoming a reality. On June 25, 1947, Robinson dominated Doyle and scored a decisive knockout in the eighth round that knocked Doyle unconscious and resulted in Doyle&#x27;s death later that night. Robinson said that the impact of Doyle&#x27;s death was &quot;very trying&quot;.

After Doyle&#x27;s death, criminal charges were threatened against Robinson in Cleveland, up to and including murder, though none actually materialized. After learning of Doyle&#x27;s intentions of using the bout&#x27;s money to buy his mother a house, Robinson gave Doyle&#x27;s mother the money from his next four bouts so she could purchase herself a home, fulfilling her son&#x27;s intention.

===Middleweight champion===

It is stated in his autobiography that one of the main considerations for his move up to middleweight was the increasing difficulty he was having in making the welterweight weight limit. However, the move up would also prove beneficial financially, as the division then contained some of the biggest names in boxing. Vying for the Pennsylvania state middleweight title in 1950, Robinson defeated Robert Villemain. Later that year, in defense of that crown, he defeated Jose Basora, with whom he had previously drawn. Robinson&#x27;s 50-second, first-round knockout of Basora set a record that would stand for 38 years. In October 1950, Robinson knocked out Bobo Olson a future middleweight title holder.

On February 14, 1951, Robinson and LaMotta met for the sixth time. The fight would become known as &quot;The St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre&quot;. Robinson won the undisputed World Middleweight title with a 13th round technical knockout. Robinson outboxed LaMotta for the first 10 rounds, then unleashed a series of savage combinations on LaMotta for three rounds, finally stopping the champion for the first time in their legendary six-bout series—and dealing LaMotta his first legitimate knockout loss in 95 professional bouts. LaMotta had lost by knockout to Billy Fox earlier in his career. However, that fight was later ruled to have been fixed and LaMotta was sanctioned for letting Fox win. That bout, and some of the other bouts in the six-fight Robinson-LaMotta rivalry, was depicted in the Martin Scorsese film &quot;Raging Bull&quot;. &quot;I fought Sugar Ray so often, I almost got diabetes&quot;, LaMotta later said. Robinson won five of his six bouts with LaMotta.

After winning his second world title, he embarked on a European tour which took him all over the Continent. Robinson traveled with his flamingo-pink Cadillac, which caused quite a stir in Paris, and an entourage of 13 people, some included &quot;just for laughs&quot;. He was a hero in France due to his recent defeat of LaMotta—the French hated LaMotta for defeating Marcel Cerdan in 1949 and taking his championship belt (Cerdan died in a plane crash en route to a rematch with LaMotta). Robinson met President of France Vincent Auriol at a ceremony attended by France&#x27;s social upper crust. During his fight in Berlin against Gerhard Hecht, Robinson was disqualified when he knocked his opponent out with a punch to the kidney: a punch legal in the US, but not Europe. The fight was later declared a no-contest. In London, Robinson lost the world middleweight title to British boxer Randolph Turpin in a sensational bout. Three months later in a rematch in front of 60,000 fans at the Polo Grounds, he knocked Turpin out in ten rounds to recover the title. In that bout Robinson was leading on the cards but was cut by Turpin. With the fight in jeopardy, Robinson let loose on Turpin, knocking him down, then getting him to the ropes and unleashing a series of punches that caused the referee to stop the bout. Following Robinson&#x27;s victory, residents of Harlem danced in the streets. In 1951, Robinson was named &quot;Ring Magazine&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Fighter of the Year&quot; for the second time.

In 1952 he fought a rematch with Olson, winning by a decision. He next defeated former champion Rocky Graziano by a third-round knockout, then challenged World Light heavyweight champion Joey Maxim. In the Yankee Stadium bout with Maxim, Robinson built a lead on all three judges&#x27; scorecards, but the temperature in the ring took its toll. The referee, Ruby Goldstein, was the first victim of the heat, and had to be replaced by referee Ray Miller. The fast-moving Robinson was the heat&#x27;s next victim – at the end of round 13, he collapsed and failed to answer the bell for the next round, suffering the only knockout of his career.

On June 25, 1952, after the Maxim bout, Robinson gave up his title and retired with a record of 131–3–1–1. He began a career in show business, singing and tap dancing. After about three years, the decline of his businesses and the lack of success in his performing career made him decide to return to boxing. He resumed training in 1954.

===Comeback===
In 1955 Robinson returned to the ring. Although he had been inactive for two and a half years, his work as a dancer kept him in peak physical condition: in his autobiography, Robinson states that in the weeks leading up to his debut for a dancing engagement in France, he ran five miles every morning, and then danced for five hours each night. Robinson even stated that the training he did in his attempts to establish a career as a dancer were harder than any he undertook during his boxing career. He won five fights in 1955, before losing a decision to Ralph &#x27;Tiger&#x27; Jones. He bounced back, however, and defeated Rocky Castellani by a split decision, then challenged Bobo Olson for the world middleweight title. He won the middleweight championship for the third time with a second-round knockout—his third victory over Olson. After his comeback performance in 1955, Robinson expected to be named fighter of the year. However, the title went to welterweight Carmen Basilio. Basilio&#x27;s handlers had lobbied heavily for it on the basis that he had never won the award, and Robinson later described this as the biggest disappointment of his professional career. &quot;I haven&#x27;t forgotten it to this day, and I never will&quot;, Robinson wrote in his autobiography. Robinson and Olson fought for the last time in 1956, and Robinson closed the four-fight series with a fourth-round knockout.

In 1957 Robinson lost his title to Gene Fullmer. Fullmer used his aggressive, forward moving style to control Robinson, and knocked him down in the fight. Robinson, however, noticed that Fullmer was vulnerable to the left hook. Fullmer headed into their May rematch as a 3–1 favorite. In the first two rounds Robinson followed Fullmer around the ring, however in the third round he changed tactics and made Fullmer come to him. At the start of the fourth round Robinson came out on the attack and stunned Fullmer, and when Fullmer returned with his own punches, Robinson traded with him, as opposed to clinching as he had done in their earlier fight. The fight was fairly even after four rounds. But in the fifth, Robinson was able to win the title back for a fourth time by knocking out Fullmer with a lightning fast, powerful left hook. Boxing critics have referred to the left-hook which knocked out Fullmer as &quot;the perfect punch&quot;. It marked the first time in 44 career fights that Fullmer had been knocked out, and when someone asked Robinson after the fight how far the left hook had travelled, Robinson replied: &quot;I can&#x27;t say. But he got the message.&quot;

Later that year, he lost his title to Basilio in a rugged 15 round fight in front of 38,000 at Yankee Stadium, but regained it for a record fifth time when he beat Basilio in the rematch. Robinson struggled to make weight, and had to go without food for nearly 20 hours leading up to the bout. He badly damaged Basilio&#x27;s eye early in the fight, and by the seventh round it was swollen shut. The two judges gave the fight to Robinson by wide margins: 72–64 and 71–64. The referee scored the fight for Basilio 69–64, and was booed loudly by the crowd of 19,000 when his decision was announced. The first fight won the &quot;Fight of the Year&quot; award from &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine for 1957 and the second fight won the &quot;Fight of the Year&quot; award for 1958.

===Decline===
Robinson knocked out Bob Young in the second round in Boston in his only fight in 1959. A year later, he defended his title against Paul Pender. Robinson entered the fight as a 5–1 favorite, but lost a split decision in front of 10,608 at Boston Garden. The day before the fight Pender commented that he planned to start slowly, before coming on late. He did just that and outlasted the aging Robinson, who, despite opening a cut over Pender&#x27;s eye in the eighth round, was largely ineffective in the later rounds. An attempt to regain the crown for an unheard of sixth time proved beyond Robinson. Despite Robinson&#x27;s efforts, Pender won by decision in that rematch. On December 3 of that year, Robinson and Fullmer fought a 15-round draw for the WBA middleweight title, which Fullmer retained. In 1961, Robinson and Fullmer fought for a fourth time, with Fullmer retaining the WBA middleweight title by a unanimous decision. The fight would be Robinson&#x27;s last title bout.

Robinson spent the rest of the 1960s fighting 10-round contests. In October 1961 Robinson defeated future world champion Denny Moyer by a unanimous decision. A 12–5 favorite, the 41-year-old Robinson defeated the 22-year-old Moyer by staying on the outside, rather than engaging him. In their rematch four months later, Moyer defeated Robinson on points, as he pressed the action and made Robinson back up throughout the fight. Moyer won 7–3 on all three judges scorecards. Robinson lost twice more in 1962, before winning six consecutive fights against mostly lesser opposition. In February 1963 Robinson lost by a unanimous decision to former world champion and fellow Hall of Famer Joey Giardello. Giardello knocked Robinson down in the fourth round, and the 43-year-old took until the count of nine to rise to his feet. Robinson was also nearly knocked down in the sixth round, but was saved by the bell. He rallied in the seventh and eight rounds, before struggling in the final two. He then embarked on an 18-month boxing tour of Europe.

Robinson&#x27;s second no-contest bout came in September 1965 in Norfolk, Virginia in a match with an opponent who turned out to be an impostor. Boxer Neil Morrison, at the time a fugitive and accused robber, signed up for the fight as Bill Henderson, a capable club fighter. The fight was a fiasco, with Morrison being knocked down twice in the first round and once in the second before the disgusted referee, who said &quot;Henderson put up no fight&quot;, walked out of the ring. Robinson was initially given a TKO in 1:20 of the second round after the &quot;obviously frightened&quot; Morrison laid himself down on the canvas. Robinson fought for the final time in November 1965. He lost by a unanimous decision to Joey Archer. Famed sports author Pete Hamill mentioned that one of the saddest experiences of his life was watching Robinson lose to Archer. He was even knocked down and Hamill pointed out that Archer had no knockout punch at all; Archer admitted afterward that it was only the second time he had knocked an opponent down in his career. The crowd of 9,023 at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh gave Robinson several standing ovations, even while he was being thoroughly outperformed by Archer.

On November 11, 1965, Robinson announced his retirement from boxing, saying: &quot;I hate to go too long campaigning for another chance.&quot; Robinson retired from boxing with a record of 174–19–6 (2 no contests) with 109 knockouts in 201 professional bouts, ranking him among the all-time leaders in knockouts.

==Later life==
In his autobiography, Robinson states that by 1965 he was broke, having spent all of the $4 million in earnings he made inside and out of the ring during his career. A month after his last fight, Robinson was honored with a Sugar Ray Robinson Night on December 10, 1965, in New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. During the ceremony, he was honored with a massive trophy. However, there was not a piece of furniture in his small Manhattan apartment with legs strong enough to support it. Robinson was elected to the &quot;Ring Magazine&quot; boxing Hall of Fame in 1967, two years after he retired and the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990. In the late 1960s he acted in some television shows, like &quot;&quot;. An episode of &quot;Land of the Giants&quot; called &quot;Giants and All That Jazz&quot; had Sugar as a washed up boxer opening a nightclub. He also appeared in a few films including the Frank Sinatra cop movie &quot;The Detective&quot; (1968), the cult classic &quot;Candy&quot; (1968), and the thriller &quot;The Todd Killings&quot; (1971) as a police officer. In 1969, he founded the Sugar Ray Robinson Youth Foundation for the inner-city Los Angeles area. The foundation does not sponsor a boxing program. 

==Death==
In Robinson&#x27;s last years he was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and diabetes mellitus that was treated with insulin. He died in Los Angeles from heart disease on April 12, 1989, at the age of 67. Robinson is buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery, Inglewood, California.

==Personal life==
Robinson married Marjorie Joseph in 1938; the marriage was annulled the same year. Their son, Ronnie Smith, was born on September 25, 1938. Robinson met his second wife Edna Mae Holly, a noted dancer who performed at the Cotton Club and toured Europe with Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway. According to Robinson, he met her at a local pool he frequented after his boxing workouts. In an attempt to get her attention he pushed her into the pool one day, and said it was an accident. After this attempt was met with disdain, he appeared at the nightclub she danced at and introduced himself. Soon the couple were dating and they married in 1944. They had one son, Ray Robinson Jr. (born 1949) before their acrimonious divorce in 1962.

In April 1959, Robinson&#x27;s eldest sister, Marie, died of cancer at the age of 41.

In December 1959, Barbara Johnson (aka Barbara Trevigne) of South Ozone Park, a singer and dancer, brought a paternity suit in New York against the former champ, claiming Sugar Ray Robinson was the father of her son Paul born in 1953. On May 18, 1963, &quot;Jet&quot; reported that the court had ruled in Robinson&#x27;s favor. Robinson is quoted exulting at the win saying &quot;Justice triumphed.&quot;

In 1965, Robinson married Millie Wiggins Bruce and the couple settled in Los Angeles. When Robinson was sick with his various ailments, his son accused the elder Robinson&#x27;s wife of keeping him under the influence of medication to manipulate him. According to Ray Robinson Jr., when Robinson Sr.&#x27;s mother died, he could not attend his mother&#x27;s funeral because Millie was drugging and controlling him. However, Robinson had been hospitalized the day before his mother&#x27;s death due to agitation which caused his blood pressure to rise. Robinson, Jr., and Edna Mae likewise said that Millie kept them away from Robinson during his last years.

Robinson was a Freemason, a membership shared with a number of other athletes, including fellow boxer Jack Dempsey.

==Boxing style==
Robinson was the modern definition of a boxer puncher. He was able to fight almost any style: he could come out one round brawling, the next counterpunching, and the next fighting on the outside flicking his jab. Robinson would use his formless style to exploit his opponents&#x27; weaknesses. He also possessed great speed and precision. He fought in a very conventional way with a firm jab, but threw hooks and uppercuts in flurries in an unconventional way. He possessed tremendous versatility—according to boxing analyst Bert Sugar, &quot;Robinson could deliver a knockout blow going backward.&quot; Robinson was efficient with both hands, and he displayed a variety of effective punches—according to a &quot;Time&quot; article in 1951, &quot;Robinson&#x27;s repertoire, thrown with equal speed and power by either hand, includes every standard punch from a bolo to a hook—and a few he makes up on the spur of the moment.&quot; Robinson commented that once fighters have trained to a certain level, their techniques and responses become almost reflexive. &quot;You don&#x27;t think. It&#x27;s all instinct. If you stop to think, you&#x27;re gone.&quot;

==Legacy==
Robinson has been ranked as the greatest boxer of all time by sportswriters, fellow boxers, and trainers. The phrase &quot;pound for pound&quot; was created by sportswriters for him during his career as a way to compare boxers irrespective of weight. Hall of Fame fighters Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis, Roberto Durán and Sugar Ray Leonard have ranked Robinson as the greatest pound-for-pound boxer in history. In 1997, &quot;The Ring&quot; ranked him as the best pound-for-pound fighter in history, and in 1999 he was named &quot;welterweight of the century&quot;, &quot;middleweight of the century&quot;, and overall &quot;fighter of the century&quot; by the Associated Press. In 2007 ESPN.com featured the piece &quot;50 Greatest Boxers of All Time&quot;, in which it named Robinson the top boxer in history. In 2003, &quot;The Ring&quot; ranked him number 11 in the list of all-time greatest punchers. Robinson was also ranked as the number 1 welterweight and the number 1 pound-for-pound boxer of all time by the International Boxing Research Organization. He was inducted into the Madison Square Garden Walk of Fame at its inception in 1992.

Robinson was one of the first African Americans to establish himself as a star outside sports. He was an integral part of the New York social scene in the 1940s and 1950s. His glamorous restaurant, Sugar Ray&#x27;s, hosted stars including Frank Sinatra, Jackie Gleason, Nat King Cole, Joe Louis, and Lena Horne. Robinson was known as a flamboyant personality outside the ring. He combined striking good looks with charisma and a flair for the dramatic. He drove a flamingo-pink Cadillac and was an accomplished singer and dancer, who once pursued a career in the entertainment industry.

According to ESPN&#x27;s Ron Flatter: &quot;He was the pioneer of boxing&#x27;s bigger-than-life entourages, including a secretary, barber, masseur, voice coach, a coterie of trainers, beautiful women, a dwarf mascot and lifelong manager George Gainford.&quot; When Robinson first traveled to Paris, a steward referred to his companions as his &quot;entourage&quot;. Although Robinson said he did not like the word&#x27;s literal definition of &quot;attendants&quot;, since he felt they were his friends, he liked the word itself and began to use it in regular conversation when referring to them. In 1962, in an effort to persuade Robinson to return to Paris—where he was still a national hero—the French promised to bring over his masseur, his hairdresser, a man who would whistle while he trained, and his trademark Cadillac. This larger-than-life persona made him the idol of millions of African American youths in the 1950s. Robinson inspired several other fighters who took the nickname &quot;Sugar&quot; in homage to him: Sugar Ray Leonard, Sugar Shane Mosley, and MMA fighter &quot;Suga&quot; Rashad Evans. Sugar Ray Leonard said, &quot;Someone once said there was a comparison between Sugar Ray Leonard and Sugar Ray Robinson. Believe me, there&#x27;s no comparison. Sugar Ray Robinson was the greatest.&quot; Laurence Holder wrote a play about him entitled &quot;Sugar Ray&quot; in 2016.

<doc id="146199" wikidata="Q7619716" url="?curid=146199" title="Stop Esso campaign">
<text>The Stop Esso campaign was a campaign by Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and People and Planet aimed at boycotting the oil company ExxonMobil (which owns and operates the brand Esso), on the grounds that it is damaging the environment.

The campaign alleges that Esso / ExxonMobil is:
* not investing in renewable energy sources
* denying the existence of global warming
* funding the creation of junk science which denies climate change, delaying urgently needed climate change action
* undermining the Kyoto Protocol.

==Stop Esso (France) website injunction==
In the early 2000s, Greenpeace was sued in France by Esso, who alleged that the company&#x27;s reputation was damaged by the campaign&#x27;s use of a parody Esso logo featuring dollar signs in place of the letters &quot;ss&quot;.

Esso claimed that the $$ resemble the SS of the Nazi paramilitary organization. In 2002, a French court ruled in favour of Esso, granting them an injunction against the French website. The campaign then moved their French web site to the United States. Another French judge has subsequently overturned the original ruling, so the site has moved back to France. The Stop Esso campaign continues to use the dollar sign logo.

==Esso&#x27;s greenhouse gas production==

Stop Esso&#x27;s consumer boycott has focused on the greenhouse gas production and climate change policies of Esso. Esso&#x27;s critics claim the company produces twice the CO2 pollution of a country such as Norway . Company data revealed a 2% increase in greenhouse gas production in 2004 to 135.6m tonnes. Supporters of Stop Esso argue that BP has a similar level of production as Esso with nearly 50% less greenhouse gas emissions. One environmental consultancy believed Esso underestimated its greenhouse gas production because it excluded petrol stations and tankers. It estimates Exxon&#x27;s production at over 300m tonnes.

==Esso&#x27;s reaction==

In response to Stop Esso, Esso gave financial support to climate change research. However, it continued to encourage President Bush and other world leaders not to sign the Kyoto Protocol which mandates decreased production of greenhouse gases.

A proportion of Esso&#x27;s greenhouse gas production arose because of the flaring of gas in Nigeria. When natural gas is brought out with oil, Esso in Nigeria burned the gas rather than processing it. Esso pledged to cease this practice by 2006.

At the same time, Exxon-Mobil funded provided the non-profit, Public Interest Watch, with $120,000 of the group&#x27;s $124,094 budget covering August 2003 to July 2004, when the group called for the Internal Revenue Service to audit Greenpeace USA According to Phil Radford, Greenpeace USA Executive Director, &quot;We might not have thought more about it, but in 2006, the Wall Street Journal reported Public Interest Watch wasn&#x27;t as obscure a group as we&#x27;d thought. Instead, Public Interest Watch received $120,000 of its $124,000 budget from ExxonMobil, the multinational entity Greenpeace has clashed with for years over its drilling, spilling, and denial of climate change.&quot; Greenpeace USA received a clean audit from the IRS.

== Stop Esso days==

<doc id="146200" wikidata="Q471546" url="?curid=146200" title="John Pilger">
<text>John Richard Pilger (; 9 October 1939 – 30 December 2023) was an Australian journalist, writer, scholar and documentary filmmaker. From 1962, he was based mainly in Britain. He was also a visiting professor at Cornell University in New York.

Pilger was a critic of American, Australian, and British foreign policy, which he considered to be driven by an imperialist and colonialist agenda. He criticised his native country&#x27;s treatment of Indigenous Australians. He first drew international attention for his reports on the Cambodian genocide.

Pilger&#x27;s career as a documentary film maker began with &quot;The Quiet Mutiny&quot; (1970), made during one of his visits to Vietnam, and continued with over 50 documentaries thereafter. Other works in this form include &quot;Year Zero&quot; (1979), about the aftermath of the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia, and &quot;Death of a Nation: The Timor Conspiracy&quot; (1993). His many documentary films on indigenous Australians include &quot;The Secret Country&quot; (1985) and &quot;Utopia&quot; (2013). In the British print media, Pilger worked at the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; from 1963 to 1986, and wrote a regular column for the &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine from 1991 to 2014.

Pilger won Britain&#x27;s Journalist of the Year Award in 1967 and 1979. His documentaries have gained awards in Britain and abroad, including a BAFTA. He came fourth in a poll of 50 heroes of all time by the New Statesman in May 2006.

==Early life and education ==
John Richard Pilger was born on 9 October 1939 in Bondi, New South Wales, the son of Claude and Elsie Pilger. His older brother, Graham (1932–2017), was a disabled rights activist who later advised the government of Gough Whitlam. Pilger was of German descent on his father&#x27;s side, while his mother had English, German and Irish ancestry; two of his maternal great-great-grandparents were Irish convicts transported to Australia. His mother taught French in school.

Pilger and his brother attended Sydney Boys High School, where he began a student newspaper, &quot;The Messenger&quot;. He later joined a four-year journalist trainee scheme with the Australian Consolidated Press.

==Newspaper and television career==

=== Newspaper ===
Beginning his career in 1958 as a copy boy with the &quot;Sydney Sun&quot;, Pilger later moved to &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; in Sydney, where he was a reporter, sportswriter and sub-editor. He also freelanced and worked for the Sydney &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, the daily paper&#x27;s sister title. After moving to Europe, he was a freelance correspondent in Italy for a year.

Settling in London in 1962 and working as a sub-editor, Pilger joined British United Press and then Reuters on its Middle-East desk. In 1963, he was recruited by the English &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, again as a sub-editor. Later, he advanced to become a reporter, a feature writer, and chief foreign correspondent for the title. While living and working in the United States for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, on 5 June 1968 he witnessed the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in Los Angeles during his presidential campaign. He was a war correspondent in Vietnam, Cambodia, Bangladesh and Biafra. Nearly eighteen months after Robert Maxwell bought the &quot;Mirror&quot; (on 12 July 1984), Pilger was sacked by Richard Stott, the newspaper&#x27;s editor, on 31 December 1985. Pilger was banned from South Africa in 1967.

Pilger was a founder of the &quot;News on Sunday&quot; tabloid in 1984 and became its editor-in-chief in 1986. During the period of hiring staff, Pilger was away for several months filming &quot;The Secret Country&quot; in Australia. Prior to this, he had given editor Keith Sutton a list of people who he thought might be recruited for the paper, but found on his return to Britain that none of them had been hired.

Pilger, however, came into conflict with those around him. He disagreed with the founders&#x27; decision to base the paper in Manchester and then clashed with the governing committees; the paper was intended to be a workers&#x27; co-operative. Sutton&#x27;s appointment as editor was Pilger&#x27;s suggestion, but he fell out with Sutton over his plan to produce a left-wing &quot;Sun&quot; newspaper. The two men ended up producing their own dummies, but the founders and the various committees backed Sutton. Pilger, appointed with &quot;overall editorial control&quot;, resigned at this point before the first issue appeared. The first issue appeared on 27 April 1987 and &quot;The News on Sunday&quot; soon closed.

Pilger returned to the &quot;Mirror&quot; in 2001 after the 9/11 attacks, while Piers Morgan was editor. In discussing why he left the paper after only being there for 18 months, he told Ian Burrell of the Independent in 2008: &quot;It was a very rewarding 18 months,&quot; he says. &quot;I was happy to keep on writing for the Mirror, but Piers was under pressure from the management and American shareholders who objected to the kind of journalism that he was publishing, often written by me. It was a myth that the readers didn&#x27;t want a serious approach to journalism in a popular newspaper.&quot;&quot;

His most frequent outlet for many years was the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, where he had a fortnightly column from 1991 when Steve Platt was editor to 2014. In 2018, Pilger said his &quot;written journalism is no longer welcome&quot; in the mainstream and that &quot;probably its last home&quot; was in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. His last column for &quot;The Guardian&quot; was in November 2019.

=== Television ===
With the actor David Swift, and the film makers Paul Watson and Charles Denton, Pilger formed Tempest Films in 1969. &quot;We wanted a frontman with a mind of his own, rather like another James Cameron, with whom Richard [Marquand] had worked&quot;, Swift once said. &quot;Paul thought John was very charismatic, as well as marketing extremely original, refreshingly radical ideas.&quot; The company was unable to gain commissions from either the BBC or ITV, but did manage to package potential projects.

Pilger&#x27;s career on television began on &quot;World in Action&quot; (Granada Television) in 1969, directed by Denton, for whom he made two documentaries broadcast in 1970 and 1971, the earliest of more than fifty in his career. &quot;The Quiet Mutiny&quot; (1970) was filmed at Camp Snuffy, presenting a character study of the common US soldier during the Vietnam War. It revealed the shifting morale and open rebellion of American troops. Pilger later described the film as &quot;something of a scoop&quot; – it was the first documentary to show the problems with morale among the drafted ranks of the US military. In an interview with the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, Pilger said:

When I flew to New York and showed it to Mike Wallace, the star reporter of CBS&#x27; &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, he agreed. &quot;Real shame we can&#x27;t show it here&quot;. 

He made other documentaries about the United States involvement in Vietnam, including &quot;Vietnam: Still America&#x27;s War&quot; (1974), &quot;Do You Remember Vietnam?&quot; (1978), and &quot;&quot; (1995).

During his work with BBC&#x27;s &quot;Midweek&quot; television series during 1972–73, Pilger completed five documentary reports, but only two were broadcast.

Pilger was successful in gaining a regular television outlet at ATV. The &quot;Pilger&quot; half-hour documentary series was commissioned by Charles Denton, then a producer with ATV, for screening on the British ITV network. The series ran for five seasons from 1974 until 1977, at first running in the UK on Sunday afternoons after &quot;Weekend World&quot;. The theme song for the series was composed by Lynsey de Paul. Later the program was scheduled in a weekday peak-time evening slot. The last series included &quot;A Faraway Country&quot; (September 1977) about dissidents in Czechoslovakia, then still part of the Communist Soviet bloc. Pilger and his team interviewed members of Charter 77 and other groups, clandestinely using domestic film equipment. In the documentary Pilger praises the dissidents&#x27; courage and commitment to freedom and describes the communist totalitarianism as &quot;fascism disguised as socialism&quot;.

Pilger was later given an hour slot at 9 pm, before &quot;News at Ten&quot;, which gave him a high profile in Britain. After ATV lost its franchise in 1981, he continued to make documentaries for screening on ITV, initially for Central, and later via Carlton Television.

==Documentaries and career: 1978–2000==
===Cambodia===

In 1979, Pilger and two colleagues with whom he collaborated for many years, documentary filmmaker David Munro and photographer Eric Piper, entered Cambodia in the wake of the overthrow of the Pol Pot regime. They made photographs and reports that were world exclusives. The first was published as a special issue of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, which sold out. They also produced an ITV documentary, &quot;Year Zero: the Silent Death of Cambodia.&quot; Whilst filming &#x27;Cambodia: Year One&quot; Pilger was placed on a &#x27;death list&#x27; by the Khmer Rouge.

Following the showing of &quot;Year Zero&quot;, some $45 million was raised, unsolicited, in mostly small donations, including almost £4 million raised by schoolchildren in the UK. This funded the first substantial relief to Cambodia, including the shipment of life-saving drugs such as penicillin, and clothing to replace the black uniforms people had been forced to wear. According to Brian Walker, director of Oxfam, &quot;a solidarity and compassion surged across our nation&quot; from the broadcast of &quot;Year Zero&quot;.

William Shawcross wrote in his book &quot;The Quality of Mercy: Cambodia, Holocaust and Modern Conscience&quot; (1984) about Pilger&#x27;s series of articles about Cambodia in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; during August 1979:
A rather interesting quality of the articles was their concentration on Nazism and the holocaust. Pilger called Pol Pot &#x27;an Asian Hitler&#x27; — and said he was even worse than Hitler . . . Again and again Pilger compared the Khmer Rouge to the Nazis. Their Marxist-Leninist ideology was not even mentioned in the &quot;Mirror&quot;, except to say they were inspired by the Red Guards. Their intellectual origins were described as &#x27;anarchist&#x27; rather than Communist&quot;.
Ben Kiernan, in his review of Shawcross&#x27;s book, notes that Pilger did compare Pol Pot&#x27;s Khmer Rouge to Stalin&#x27;s terror, as well as to Mao&#x27;s Red Guards. Kiernan notes instances where other writers&#x27; comparisons of Pol Pot to Hitler or the Vietnamese to the Nazis are either accepted by Shawcross in his account, or not mentioned.

Shawcross wrote in &quot;The Quality of Mercy&quot; that &quot;Pilger&#x27;s reports underwrote almost everything that refugees along the Thai border had been saying about the cruelty of Khmer Rouge rule since 1975, and that had already appeared in the books by the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; and François Ponchaud. In &quot;Heroes&quot;, Pilger disputes François Ponchaud and Shawcross&#x27;s account of Vietnamese atrocities during the Vietnamese invasion and near famine as being &quot;unsubstantiated&quot;. Ponchaud had interviewed members of anti-communist groups living in the Thai refugee border camps. According to Pilger, &quot;At the very least the effect of Shawcross&#x27;s &#x27;exposé&#x27;&quot; of Cambodians&#x27; treatment at the hands of the Vietnamese &quot;was to blur the difference between Cambodia under Pol Pot and Cambodia liberated by the Vietnamese: in truth, a difference of night and day&quot;. In his book, Shawcross himself doubted that anyone had died of starvation.

Pilger and Munro made four later films about Cambodia. Pilger&#x27;s documentary &quot;Cambodia – The Betrayal&quot; (1990), prompted a libel case against him, which was settled at the High Court with an award against Pilger and Central Television. &quot;The Times&quot; of 6 July 1991 reported:
Two men who claimed that a television documentary accused them of being SAS members who trained Pol Pot&#x27;s Khmer Rouge to lay mines, accepted &quot;very substantial&quot; libel damages in the High Court yesterday. Christopher Geidt and Anthony De Normann settled their action against the journalist John Pilger and Central Television on the third day of the hearing. Desmond Browne, QC, for Mr Pilger and Central Television, said his clients had not intended to allege the two men trained the Khmer Rouge to lay mines, but they accepted that was how the program had been understood.

Pilger said the defence case collapsed because the government issued a gagging order, citing national security, which prevented three government ministers and two former heads of the SAS from appearing in court. The film received a British Academy of Film and Television Award nomination in 1991.

===Thai slavery story===
In 1982 Pilger authored an article for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; in which he wrote that he had bought an 8-year-old Thai slave girl for £85, and subsequently to have discovered her village of origin in Northern Thailand and returned her to her mother, with Pilger pledging money to support the girl&#x27;s education. This story was subsequently cast into doubt by an investigation in the &quot;Far Eastern Economic Review&quot; (FEER) which uncovered that the girl and her mother had been paid to play their respective parts by a fixer working for Pilger. Pilger accused those involved at FEER of being CIA agents. An article by the right-wing journalist Auberon Waugh to &quot;The Spectator&quot; cast further doubt on the story. Pilger threatened &quot;The Spectator&quot; with an action for libel. In responding to The Bulletin&#x27;s coverage of the issue Pilger wrote the following on 17 August 1982:

I Do Not Believe I was HoaxedPilger went on in his letter to point out that he wasn&#x27;t in Thailand on the month it was alleged to have occurred. The matter was settled out of court without any payment to Pilger.

===Australia&#x27;s Indigenous peoples===
Pilger long criticised aspects of Australian government policy, particularly what he regarded as its inherent racism resulting in the poor treatment of Indigenous Australians. In 1969, Pilger went with Australian activist Charlie Perkins on a tour to Jay Creek in Central Australia. He compared what he witnessed in Jay Creek to South African apartheid. He saw the appalling conditions that the Aboriginal people were living under, with children suffering from malnutrition and grieving mothers and grandmothers having had their lighter-skinned children and grandchildren removed by the police and welfare agencies. Equally, he learned of Aboriginal boys being sent to work on white-run farms, and Aboriginal girls working as servants in middle-class homes as undeclared slave labour.

Pilger made several documentaries about Indigenous Australians, such as &quot;The Secret Country: The First Australians Fight Back&quot; (1985) and &quot;Welcome to Australia&quot; (1999). His book on the subject, &quot;A Secret Country&quot;, was first published in 1989. Pilger wrote in 2000 that the 1998 legislation that removed the common-law rights of Indigenous peoples:
is just one of the disgraces that has given Australia the distinction of being the only developed country whose government has been condemned as racist by the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.

Pilger returned to this subject with &quot;Utopia&quot;, released in 2013 (see below).

===East Timor===
====&quot;Death of a Nation: The Timor Conspiracy&quot;====

In East Timor Pilger clandestinely shot &quot;Death of a Nation: The Timor Conspiracy&quot; about the brutal Indonesian occupation of East Timor, which began in 1975.

&quot;Death of a Nation&quot; contributed to an international outcry which ultimately led to Indonesian withdrawal from East Timor and eventual independence in 2000. When &quot;Death of a Nation&quot; was screened in Britain it was the highest rating documentary in 15 years and 5,000 telephone calls per minute were made to the programme&#x27;s action line. When &quot;Death of a Nation&quot; was screened in Australia in June 1994, Foreign Minister Gareth Evans declared that Pilger &quot;had a track record of distorted sensationalism mixed with sanctimony.&quot;

==Documentaries and career (2000-2023)==
===&quot;Palestine Is Still the Issue&quot;===

Pilger&#x27;s documentary &quot;Palestine Is Still the Issue&quot; was released in 2002 and had Ilan Pappé as historical adviser. Pilger 
said the film describes how an &quot;historic injustice has been done to the Palestinian people, and until Israel&#x27;s illegal and brutal occupation ends, there will be no peace for anyone, Israelis included&quot;. He said the responses of his interviewees &quot;put the lie to the standard Zionist cry that any criticism of Israel is anti-semitic, a claim that insults all those Jewish people who reject the likes of Ariel Sharon acting in their name&quot;. Its broadcast resulted in complaints by the Israeli embassy, the Board of Deputies of British Jews, and the Conservative Friends of Israel that it was inaccurate and biased. Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications, the company that made the film, also objected to it in an interview with &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;.

The UK television regulator, the Independent Television Commission (ITC), ordered an investigation. The ITC investigation rejected the complaints about the film, stating in its report:
The ITC raised with Carlton all the significant areas of inaccuracy critics of the programme alleged and the broadcaster answered them by reference to a range of historical texts. The ITC is not a tribunal of fact and is particularly aware of the difficulties of verifying &#x27;historical fact&#x27; but the comprehensiveness and authority of Carlton&#x27;s sources were persuasive, not least because many appeared to be of Israeli origin.

The ITC concluded that in Pilger&#x27;s documentary &quot;adequate opportunity was given to a pro-Israeli government perspective&quot; and that the programme &quot;was not in breach of the ITC Programme Code&quot;.

===&quot;Stealing a Nation&quot;===

Pilger&#x27;s documentary &quot;Stealing a Nation&quot; (2004) recounts the expulsion of the Chagossians by Britain and the USA between 1967 and 1973 so that the US could construct a military base on their former land. The poor economic situation faced by the Chagossians in Mauritius as a result of the deportation is described in the film. After the expulsion, the United States government leased Diego Garcia, the largest island in the Chagos Islands, from Britain and constructed a major military base there. In the 21st century, the US used the base for planes which were bombing targets in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In a 2000 ruling on the events, the International Court of Justice described the wholesale removal of the Chagossian peoples from the Chagos Islands by Britain as &quot;a crime against humanity&quot;. Pilger strongly criticised Tony Blair for failing to respond in a substantive way to the 2000 High Court ruling that the expulsion of the Chagossian people to Mauritius was illegal.

In March 2005, &quot;Stealing a Nation&quot; received the Royal Television Society Award.

===Latin America: &quot;The War on Democracy&quot; (2007)===

The documentary &quot;The War on Democracy&quot; (2007) was Pilger&#x27;s first film to be released in the cinema. In &quot;an unremitting assault on American foreign policy since 1945&quot;, according to Andrew Billen in &quot;The Times&quot;, the film explores the role of US interventions, overt and covert, in toppling a series of governments in the region, and placing &quot;a succession of favourably disposed bullies in control of its Latino backyard&quot;. It discusses the US role in the overthrow in 1973 of the democratically elected Chilean leader Salvador Allende, who was replaced by the military dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet. Pilger interviews several ex-CIA agents who purportedly took part in secret campaigns against democratic governments in South America. It also contains what Peter Bradshaw in &quot;The Guardian&quot; described as &quot;a dewy-eyed interview&quot; with President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, which has moments of &quot;almost &quot;Hello!&quot;-magazine deference&quot;.

Pilger explores the US Army School of the Americas in the US state of Georgia. Generations of South American military were trained there, with a curriculum including counter-insurgency techniques. Attendees reportedly included members of Pinochet&#x27;s security services, along with men from Haiti, El Salvador, Argentina and Brazil who have been implicated in human rights abuses.

The film also details the attempted overthrow of Venezuela&#x27;s President Hugo Chávez in 2002, and the response of the people of Caracas. It looks at the wider rise of populist governments across South America, led by figures calling for loosening ties with the United States and attempting a more equitable redistribution of the continent&#x27;s natural wealth. Of &quot;Chávez&#x27;s decision to bypass the National Assembly for 18 months, and rule by decree&quot;, Peter Bradshaw writes &quot;Pilger passes over it very lightly&quot;.

Pilger said the film is about the struggle of people to free themselves from a modern form of slavery. These people, he says,describe a world not as American presidents like to see it as useful or expendable, they describe the power of courage and humanity among people with next to nothing. They reclaim noble words like democracy, freedom, liberation, justice, and in doing so they are defending the most basic human rights of all of us in a war being waged against all of us.

&quot;The War on Democracy&quot; won the Best Documentary category at the One World Media Awards in 2008.

===&quot;The War You Don&#x27;t See&quot; (2010)===
The subject of &quot;The War You Don&#x27;t See&quot; is the role of the media in making war. It concentrates on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and Israel&#x27;s occupation of the Palestinian territories. It begins with the Collateral Murder video leaked by Chelsea Manning and released by WikiLeaks. In an interview, Julian Assange describes WikiLeaks as an organisation that gives power to &#x27;conscientious objectors&#x27; within &#x27;power systems&#x27;. The documentary contends that the media far from acting as the fourth estate – instead uncritically reports the official line and spin from governments and in turn delivers propaganda over journalism. During the documentary Pilger states that &quot;propaganda relies on us in the media to aim its deceptions not at a far away country but at you at home&quot;.

==== Reception ====
In its review, Time Out magazine said: &quot;This wonderfully researched and outraged film gathers and presents the case for the prosecution. In a world of embedded reporters, sophisticated spin and governmental evasion, what price investigative journalism?&quot;

For Christopher Czechowicz of the Frontline Club: &quot;Perhaps what’s most important about this film is its simple message. For John Pilger, the mainstream Fourth Estate is not doing its job properly. Whereas independent journalists are able to articulate the truth in a sophisticated manner, mainstream sources remain disinterested in their work. Time and again, they prefer baseless information, sound bytes and sensational footage of clamoring crowds that rouse emotion to the hard tasks journalists must perform. In Pilger’s final remarks in the film, what remains clear is that more than ever, uncompromised, brave journalism is needed in our world, always challenging the official story, in his words, “however patriotic it appears, or however seductive or insidious it is.”

When interviewed about the film on Al Jazeera&#x27;s The Listening Post he was asked that the media could in fact prevent war, Pilger replied that in his own view that the media could in fact stop a war from occurring.

Having been criticised directly in the documentary, with Pilger interviewing Fran Unsworth, the then BBC Head of Newsgathering about its war coverage. The former BBC World News editor, Jon Williams responded to the charge of embedded journalism no longer being objective with the following: &quot;But &quot;embedding&quot; does have real value. There are 9,500 British troops in Afghanistan - and more than 100,000 US service personnel. Theirs is an important perspective, and their operations an important part of the story. The security situation means, sometimes, it is only possible to travel to certain parts of the country as part of a military &quot;embed&quot;.&quot;

John Lloyd in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; said &quot;The War You Don&#x27;t See&quot; was a &quot;one-sided&quot; documentary which &quot;had no thought of explaining, even hinting, that the wars fought by the US and the UK had a scrap of just cause, nor of examining the nature of what Pilger simply stated were &quot;lies&quot; – especially those that took the two countries to the invasion of Iraq&quot;.

===&quot;Utopia&quot; (2013)===

With &quot;Utopia&quot;, Pilger returned to the experiences of Indigenous Australians and what he termed &quot;the denigrating of their humanity&quot;. A documentary feature film, it takes its title from Utopia, an Aboriginal homeland (also known as an outstation) in the Northern Territory. Pilger says that &quot;in essence, very little&quot; has changed since the first of his seven films about the Aboriginal people, &quot;A Secret Country: The First Australians&quot; (1985). In an interview with the UK based &quot;Australian Times&quot; he commented: &quot;the catastrophe imposed on Indigenous Australians is the equivalent of apartheid, and the system has to change&quot;.

Reviewing the film, Peter Bradshaw wrote: &quot;The awful truth is that Indigenous communities are on mineral-rich lands that cause mouths to water in mining corporation boardrooms&quot;. &quot;When the subject and subjects are allowed to speak for themselves – when Pilger doesn&#x27;t stand and preach – the injustices glow like throbbing wounds&quot;, wrote Nigel Andrews in the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, but the documentary maker &quot;goes on too long. 110 minutes is a hefty time in screen politics, especially when we know the makers&#x27; message from scene one&quot;.

Geoffrey Macnab described it as an &quot;angry, impassioned documentary&quot; while for Mark Kermode it is a &quot;searing indictment of the ongoing mistreatment&quot; of the first Australians.

===&quot;The Coming War on China&quot; (2016)===
&quot;The Coming War on China&quot; was Pilger&#x27;s 60th film for ITV.

The film premiered in the UK on Thursday 1 December 2016, and was shown on ITV at 10.40 pm on Tuesday 6 December and on the Australian public broadcaster SBS on 16 April 2017. In the documentary, according to Pilger, &quot;the evidence and witnesses warn that nuclear war is no longer a shadow, but a contingency. The greatest build-up of American-led military forces since the Second World War is well under way. They are on the western borders of Russia, and in Asia and the Pacific, confronting China. Like the renewal of post-Soviet Russia, the rise of China as an economic power is declared an &#x27;existential threat&#x27; to the divine right of the United States to rule and dominate human affairs&quot;.

&quot;The first third told, and told well, the unforgivable, unconscionable tale of what has overtaken the Marshall Islanders since 1946, when the US first nuked the test site on Bikini Atoll&quot; beginning an extended series of tests, wrote Euan Ferguson in &quot;The Observer&quot;. &quot;Over the next 12 years they would unleash a total of 42.2 megatons. The islanders, as forensically proved by Pilger, were effectively guinea pigs for [the] effects of radiation&quot;. Ferguson wrote that the rest of the film &quot;was a sane, sober, necessary, deeply troubling bucketful of worries&quot;. Peter Bradshaw in &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that the film &quot;lays bare the historical horrors of the US military in the Pacific, exposing the paranoia and pre-emptive aggression of its semi-secret bases,&quot; adding: &quot;This is a gripping film, which though it comes close to excusing China ... does point out China&#x27;s insecurities and political cruelties&quot;. Neil Young of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called the film an &quot;authoritative indictment of American nefariousness in the western Pacific&quot;.

Kevin Maher wrote in &quot;The Times&quot; that he admired the early sequences on the Marshall Islands, but that he believed the film lacked nuance or subtlety. Maher wrote that, for Pilger, China is &quot;a brilliant place with just some &#x27;issues with human rights&#x27;, but let&#x27;s not go into that now&quot;. &quot;Diplomat&quot; columnist David Hutt said &quot;Pilger consistently glosses over China&#x27;s past crimes while dwelling on America&#x27;s&quot;.

===&quot;The Dirty War on the National Health Service&quot; (2019)===
Pilger&#x27;s &quot;The Dirty War on the National Health Service&quot; was released in the UK on 29 November 2019 and examined the changes that the NHS had undergone since its founding in 1948. Pilger makes the case that governments beginning with that of Margaret Thatcher have waged a secret war against the NHS with a view to privatising it slowly and surreptitiously. Pilger predicted that moves toward privatisation would create more poverty and homelessness and that the resulting chaos would be used as an argument for further &quot;reform&quot;. Prior to the 2019 United Kingdom general election, ITV were embargoed from publicising the documentary (as the election was on the 12th of December 2019). It was later broadcast on 17 December 2019. It was also referenced in a 2020 essay in The Nation magazine, &quot;How to Destroy a National Health Service&quot;.

==== Reception ====
Peter Bradshaw described the documentary as a &quot;fierce, necessary film&quot;. Emma Simmonds of the Radio Times said: &quot;Pilger is a constant, typically authoritative, slightly doom-laden presence.&quot;

==Views (1999–2023)==

=== Australia ===
Writing for the New Matilda in 2020: &quot;Today, Australia is a vassal state bar none: its politics, intelligence agencies, military and much of its media are integrated into Washington’s “sphere of dominance” and war plans. In Donald Trump&#x27;s current provocations of China, the US bases in Australia are described as the “tip of the spear”.

===Bush, Blair, Howard and wars===

In 2003 and 2004, Pilger criticised United States President George W. Bush, saying that he had used the 9/11 terrorist attacks as an excuse to invade Iraq as part of a strategy to increase US control of the world&#x27;s oil supplies. In 2004, Pilger criticised British Prime Minister Tony Blair as equally responsible for the invasion and the bungled occupation of Iraq. In 2004, as the Iraq insurgency increased, Pilger wrote that the anti-war movement should support &quot;Iraq&#x27;s anti-occupation resistance:
We cannot afford to be choosy. While we abhor and condemn the continuing loss of innocent life in Iraq, we have no choice now but to support the resistance, for if the resistance fails, the &quot;Bush gang&quot; will attack another country&quot;.

Pilger described Australian Prime Minister John Howard as &quot;the mouse that roars for America, whipping his country into war fever and paranoia about terrorism within&quot;. He thought Howard&#x27;s willingness to &quot;join the Bush/Blair assault on Iraq ... evok[ed] a melancholy history of obsequious service to great power: from the Boxer Rebellion to the Boer war, to the disaster at Gallipoli, and Korea, Vietnam and the Gulf&quot;.

On 25 July 2005, Pilger ascribed blame for the 2005 London bombings that month to Blair. He wrote that Blair&#x27;s decision to follow Bush helped to generate the rage that Pilger said precipitated the bombings.

In his column a year later, Pilger described Blair as a war criminal for supporting Israel&#x27;s actions during the 2006 Israel–Lebanon conflict. He said that Blair gave permission to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in 2001 to initiate what would ultimately become Operation Defensive Shield.

In 2014, Pilger wrote that &quot;The truth about the criminal bloodbath in Iraq cannot be &quot;countered&quot; indefinitely. Neither can the truth about our support for the medievalists in Saudi Arabia, the nuclear-armed predators in Israel, the new military fascists in Egypt and the jihadist &quot;liberators&quot; of Syria, whose propaganda is now BBC news&quot;.

===Barack Obama===
Pilger criticised Barack Obama during his presidential campaign of 2008, saying that he was &quot;a glossy Uncle Tom who would bomb Pakistan&quot; and his theme &quot;was the renewal of America as a dominant, avaricious bully&quot;. After Obama was elected and took office in 2009, Pilger wrote, &quot;In his first 100 days, Obama has excused torture, opposed &quot;habeas corpus&quot; and demanded more secret government&quot;.

Sunny Hundal wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; during November 2008 that the &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; comment used against Obama &quot;highlights a patronising attitude towards ethnic minorities. Pilger expects all black and brown people to be revolutionary brothers and sisters, and if they veer away from that stereotype, it can only be because they are pawns of a wider conspiracy&quot;.

===Support for Julian Assange===
Pilger supported Julian Assange by pledging bail in December 2010. Pilger said at the time: &quot;There&#x27;s no doubt that he is not going to abscond&quot;. Assange sought asylum in the Embassy of Ecuador in London in 2012 and Pilger&#x27;s bail money was lost when a judge ordered it to be forfeited.

Pilger had been critical of the media&#x27;s treatment of Assange saying: &quot;The same brave newspapers and broadcasters that have supported Britain&#x27;s part in epic bloody crimes, from the genocide in Indonesia to the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, now attack the &quot;human rights record&quot; of Ecuador, whose real crime is to stand up to the bullies in London and Washington&quot;.

He criticised the failure of the Australian government to object when it &quot;repeatedly received confirmation that the US was conducting an &#x27;unprecedented&#x27; pursuit of Assange&quot; and noted that one of the reasons Ecuador gave for granting asylum to Assange was his abandonment by Australia.

Pilger visited Assange in the embassy and continued to support him.

===Comments about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton===
In a February 2016 webchat on the website of &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, Pilger said &quot;Trump is speaking straight to ordinary Americans&quot;. Although his opinions about immigration were &quot;gross&quot;, Pilger wrote that they are &quot;no more gross in essence than, say, David Cameron&#x27;s – he is not planning to invade anywhere, he doesn&#x27;t hate the Russians or the Chinese, he is not beholden to Israel. People like this lack of cant, and when the so-called liberal media deride him, they like him even more&quot;. In March 2016, Pilger commented in a speech delivered at the University of Sydney during the 2016 United States presidential election, that Donald Trump was a less dangerous potential President of the United States than Hillary Clinton.

In November 2016, Pilger said that &quot;notorious terrorist jihadist group called ISIL or ISIS is created largely with money from [the government of Saudi and the government of Qatar] who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation&quot;.

In August 2017, in an article published on his website, Pilger wrote that a &quot;coup against the man in the White House is under way. This is not because he is an odious human being, but because he has consistently made clear he does not want war with Russia. This glimpse of sanity, or simple pragmatism, is anathema to the &#x27;national security&#x27; managers who guard a system based on war, surveillance, armaments, threats and extreme capitalism&quot;. According to Pilger, &quot;The Guardian&quot; had published &quot;drivel&quot; in covering the claims &quot;that the Russians conspired with Trump&quot;. Such assertions, he wrote, are &quot;reminiscent of the far-right smearing of John Kennedy as a &#x27;Soviet agent&#x27;&quot;.

===Russia===
Pilger was a member of Committee of Supporters for the RAW in WAR Anna Politkovskaya Award. He had chosen Anna Politkovskaya&#x27;s work to a book edited by him, &quot;Tell Me No Lies: Investigative Journalism And Its Triumphs&quot; (2004). Pilger also signed a petition demanding an international commission of inquiry to discover the truth behind Politkovskaya&#x27;s murder.

In an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, John Pilger wrote in May 2014 that Vladimir Putin &quot;is the only leader to condemn the rise of fascism in 21st-century Europe&quot;. Historian Timothy Snyder assessed this statement as inaccurate since Russia at the time had organized meetings of European fascists and was subsidizing France&#x27;s far Right party, the &quot;National Rally&quot;, until 2018 known as the &quot;National Front&quot;. Pilger quoted in the article a Jewish doctor who had tried to rescue people from the burning trade union building during the 2014 Odesa clashes, and was stopped by Ukrainian Nazis with the threat that this fate would soon befall him and other Jews and that what happened yesterday would not have happened even during the fascist occupation in World War II. This claim was factually false, as several tens of thousands of Jews were murdered in three days in October 1941. It turned out that the man&#x27;s quote came from a Facebook page that had been identified as a fake before the article was published.

On the Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal on 4 March 2018, Pilger said in an interview on Russia&#x27;s RT: &quot;This is a carefully constructed drama as part of the propaganda campaign that has been building now for several years in order to justify the actions of NATO, Britain and the United States, towards Russia. That&#x27;s a fact&quot;. Such events as the Iraq War, &quot;at the very least should make us sceptical of Theresa May&#x27;s theatrics in Parliament&quot;. He hinted that the UK government may have been involved in the attack, saying it had motive and that the nearby Porton Down laboratory has a &quot;long and sinister record with nerve gas and chemical weapons&quot;.

In January 2022, Pilger repeatedly denied that Russia was about to invade Ukraine, doing so even three days before the invasion. Following the start of the invasion, Pilger condemned Russia&#x27;s actions, but stated that they were due to the enlargement of NATO towards Russia.

=== On journalism education ===
Since being invited to open the University of Lincoln&#x27;s journalism school in 2004, Pilger told the packed room at its launch that &quot;Too often courses are like factories churning out conformist journalists for the industry. They tend to promote a ‘top-down’ kind of journalism which prioritises elite sources. Too rarely do they promote journalism that prioritises the views of ‘ordinary’ people. From my experience these are the people I can trust the most.”

Pilger disagreed with the term mainstream media in 2009 lecture to students at the University of Lincoln: &quot;He disputed the label of “mainstream”, preferring to label it “corporate”, as the most prominent media outlets are often controlled by large corporations. “Those whose journalism is meant for the most people are the mainstream.”&quot;

In conversation with Charles Glass at the Frontline club in 2012, Pilger commented that:

“Journalism students should be taught to be sceptical of their employers, sceptical of their governments. Governments are still portrayed as benign if they’re ours, and if they’re other’s, they’re not.”

“Media is an extension of power but when we recognise that we become aware of official drivel and understand that the truth is subversive. It always is.&quot;

Writing for Arena Online in 2022, Pilger said: &quot;When will we allow ourselves to understand? Training journalists factory style is not the answer. Neither is the wondrous digital tool, which is a means, not an end, like the one-finger typewriter and the linotype machine.

In recent years, some of the best journalists have been eased out of the mainstream. ‘Defenestrated’ is the word used. The spaces once open to mavericks, to journalists who went against the grain, truth-tellers, have closed.&quot;

In an interview with the Independent&#x27;s Rob Brown in 1998 he noted the difficulty journalism students had in securing work: &quot;You say lots of allegedly wise things to students and at the end they invariably ask the same question: &#x27;How do we get a job?&#x27; That&#x27;s a big pressure on young people. It&#x27;s made the true maverick in journalism an endangered species. People simply cannot afford to be mavericks any more.&quot;

Remarking in an interview with Ian Burrell of the Independent in 2008 that &quot;...many start with the same passion I started with&quot; and implores them to &quot;keep your principles as you navigate the system&quot;. His watchword remains, &#x27;Never believe anything until it&#x27;s officially denied,&#x27; a favourite expression of reporter Claud Cockburn, father of Independent journalist Patrick Cockburn.

== Criticism of corporate journalism ==
In 2008, in an interview with Ian Burrell of the Independent, Pilger remarked: &quot;&quot;The influence of The Independent and Guardian are much greater than you would think. I don&#x27;t believe the majority of people in Britain have the so-called values of The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail and certainly not The Sun. That doesn’t mean to say they flock to read the Guardian and the Independent, clearly they don’t. But on occasion, these newspapers speak up and gesture towards people, or they pretend to. Without them there would be an entirely closed media.”

He disagreed with the concept of mainstream media, telling an audience at the University of Lincoln in 2009:

&quot;I think the public is beginning to see the corporate media as a system of propaganda, a monoculture whose differences — rather like party politics — are illusory.”&quot;

Pilger criticised many journalists of the corporate media. During the administration of President Bill Clinton in the US, Pilger attacked the British-American Project as an example of &quot;Atlanticist freemasonry&quot;. He asserted in November 1998 that &quot;many members are journalists, the essential foot soldiers in any network devoted to power and propaganda&quot;. In 2002, he said that &quot;many journalists now are no more than channellers and echoers of what Orwell called the official truth&quot;.

Also in 2003, he criticised what he called the &quot;liberal lobby&quot; which &quot;promote killing&quot; from &quot;behind a humanitarian mask&quot;. He said David Aaronovitch exemplified the &quot;mask-wearers&quot; and noted that Aaronovitch had written that the attack on Iraq will be &quot;the easy bit&quot;. Aaronovitch responded to an article by Pilger about the mainstream media in 2003 as one of his &quot;typical pieces about the corruption of most journalists (ie people like me [Aaronovitch]) versus the bravery of a few (ie people like him)&quot;.

In an address at Columbia University on 14 April 2006, Pilger said:
During the Cold War, a group of Russian journalists toured the United States. On the final day of their visit, they were asked by their hosts for their impressions. &#x27;I have to tell you,&#x27; said their spokesman, &#x27;that we were astonished to find after reading all the newspapers and watching TV, that all the opinions on all the vital issues were by and large, the same. To get that result in our country, we imprison people, we tear out their fingernails. Here, you don&#x27;t have that. What&#x27;s the secret? How do you do it?&#x27;
On another occasion, while speaking to journalism students at the University of Lincoln, Pilger said that mainstream journalism means corporate journalism. As such, he believes it represents vested corporate interests more than those of the public.

===BBC===
Pilger wrote in December 2002, of British broadcasting&#x27;s requirement for &quot;impartiality,&quot; as being &quot;a euphemism for the consensual view of established authority&quot;. He wrote that &quot;BBC television news faithfully echoed word for word&quot; government &quot;propaganda designed to soften up the public for Blair&#x27;s attack on Iraq&quot;. In his documentary &quot;The War You Don&#x27;t See&quot; (2010), Pilger returned to this theme and accused the BBC of failing to cover the viewpoint of the victims, civilians caught up in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He additionally pointed to the 48 documentaries on Ireland made for the BBC and ITV between 1959 and the late-1980s which were delayed or altered before transmission, or totally suppressed.

==Personal life ==
Pilger was married to journalist Scarth Flett, granddaughter of the physician and geologist Sir John Smith Flett. Their son Sam was born in 1973 and is a sports writer. Pilger also had a daughter, Zoe Pilger (who is an author and art critic), born 1984, with journalist Yvonne Roberts.

Outside of news and current affairs, Pilger enjoyed cooking, surfing, TV and sport. His favourite book is Joseph Heller&#x27;s Catch-22 and his favourite song: Blue Moon Of Kentucky by Elvis Presley Having appeared on Desert Island Discs on 18 Feb 1990, he revealed that his luxury item was a typewriter.

== Death and tributes ==
Pilger died of pulmonary fibrosis in London on 30 December 2023, at the age of 84; he is survived by Jane Hill, his partner for thirty years.

=== Tributes ===
The managing director of Media and Entertainment at ITV. Kevin Lygo, said &quot;John was a giant of campaigning journalism&quot;. &quot;He had a clear, distinctive editorial voice which he used to great effect throughout his distinguished filmmaking career. His documentaries were engaging, challenging and always very watchable&quot; and &quot;...He eschewed comfortable consensus and instead offered a radical, alternative approach on current affairs and a platform for dissenting voices over 50 years&quot;

A number of journalists had also paid tribute to Pilger upon his passing. From the BBC&#x27;s World Affairs Editor, John Simpson, Channel 4&#x27;, Jon Snow and Private Eye&#x27;s Solomon Hughes and the Daily Mirror&#x27;s, Ros Wynne-Jones

The academic journal, Ethical Space provided a number of tributes to Pilger. In addition to being collated on his website. The 45th News and Documentary Emmy Awards also paid tribute in 2024 (at 1:44). The BFI hosted the panel: The Pilger Effect: A celebration of the life and work of John Pilger.

== In popular culture ==
A documentary filmmaker named John Pillinger appeared in an Iron Man &quot;Extremis&quot; comic book story written by Warren Ellis in January 2005. Pillinger interviews war profiteer Tony Stark for his documentary film &quot;The Ghosts of the Twentieth Century&quot;.

In Rap News 7, Revolution spreads to America by Juice Rap News, Pilger&#x27;s impersonation employed his characteristics from his intonation, piece to camera and employed Pilgerist language from &#x27;the war you don&#x27;t see&#x27; to &#x27;the two party system&#x27;.

== Archive and legacy ==
In 2008, he was awarded the Doctor of Arts by the University of Lincoln and opened its school of journalism in 2004. In an interview with the Linc (the University of Lincoln&#x27;s student newspaper) asked about how the award would be appreciated alongside his other awards, he replied: &quot;Well, it’s already in pride of place on the wall of my office!&quot; 

The John Pilger Archive is now housed at the British Library. The papers can be accessed through the British Library catalogue. It was launched and based at the University of Lincoln from 2009 to 2017. The archive features his news reports, films and radio broadcasts and was digitised by former PhD student, now Senior Lecturer in Journalism, Dr Florian Zollmann.

In an article for the New Matilda, ABC Brisbane presenter, David Iliffe spoke to Chris Graham, the new Matilda editor and associate producer of Utopia about John&#x27;s legacy.

The UK&#x27;s Information Research Department (IRD), a department of the Foreign Office, opened a file on Pilger in 1975. The file was passed to the Foreign Office&#x27;s Special Production Unit when the IRD was shut down in 1977. Declassified UK published an article on the declassified files, which showed he was under covert monitoring; commenting prior to his death Pilger remarked &quot;My reporting, which was really exclusive, it was telling people something that they didn&#x27;t know, it was exposing a great deal, it was exposing the tyrants, but it was also exposing who was backing the tyrants secretly – it’s rather embarrassing.&quot;

== Criticism ==
In adopting his non-impartial stance, Pilger often drew criticism from the political right who interpreted his work as controversial. &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s obituary noted: &quot;The ferocity of rightwing criticism of his views indicated the effectiveness of his journalism.&quot;

As such he was met with criticism from the right-wing journalist Auberon Waugh (whose own ethics with regard to journalism was noted by the Guardian in his obituary: &quot;Once he discovered the delights of the &quot;freebie&quot;, he gave breathless accounts of his trips to the Orient, and the wonderful &quot;Thai two-girl massage&quot;.) He went onto coin the verb &quot;to Pilger&quot; in reference to John Pilger, and its intended meaning was &quot;presenting information in a sensationalist manner in support of a particular conclusion&quot;.

In its obituary for Pilger, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, wrote that &quot;many regarded Pilger as the finest crusading journalist of his generation. He did much to draw world attention to some of the most notorious human rights abuses of the late 20th century&quot;. It criticised his 1990 coverage of the Cambodian genocide for not identifying Pol Pot&#x27;s Khmer Rouge as communists, and criticised his praise for the Vietnam-backed government of Hun Sen for not mentioning that Hun Sen was a former member of the Khmer Rouge. Noam Chomsky said that Pilger made people uncomfortable by exposing the awful reality of US foreign policy. The U.K. journalist William Shawcross described Pilger as &quot;dangerous to the causes which he claims to espouse&quot;.

He was also met with criticism from the left with journalist Owen Jones responding to his criticism in CounterPunch written in 2016

<text>Tonsure () is the practice of cutting or shaving some or all of the hair on the scalp as a sign of religious devotion or humility. The term originates from the Latin word &quot;&quot; (meaning &quot;clipping&quot; or &quot;shearing&quot;) and referred to a specific practice in medieval Catholicism, abandoned by papal order in 1972. Tonsure can also refer to the secular practice of shaving all or part of the scalp to show support or sympathy, or to designate mourning. Current usage more generally refers to cutting or shaving for monks, devotees, or mystics of any religion as a symbol of their renunciation of worldly fashion and esteem.

Tonsure is still a traditional practice in Catholicism by specific religious orders (with papal permission). It is also commonly used in the Eastern Orthodox Church for newly baptised members and is frequently used for Buddhist novices, monks, and nuns. The complete shaving of one&#x27;s head bald, or just shortening the hair, exists as a traditional practice in Islam after completion of the &quot;Hajj&quot; and is also practised by a number of Hindu religious orders.

==Hinduism==

Tonsure is usually the part of three rites of passages in the life of the individual in Hinduism. The first is called chudakarana (IAST: Cūḍākaraṇa, Sanskrit: चूडाकरण; literally, &quot;rite of tonsure&quot;), also known as &quot;chaula&quot;, &quot;chudakarma&quot;, &quot;mundana&quot;, or &quot;mundan&quot;, marks the child&#x27;s first haircut, typically the shaving of the head. The mother dresses up, sometimes in her wedding sari, and with the father present, the baby&#x27;s head is shaved and nails trimmed, washed and dressed in new clothes. Sometimes, a tuft of hair (shikha) is left to cover the soft spot near the top of the baby&#x27;s head. Both boys and girls typically go through this ceremony, sometimes near a temple or a river, but it is not mandatory in Hinduism.

The significance of the chudakarana rite of passage is the baby&#x27;s cyclical step to hygiene and cleanliness. The ritual is typically done about the first birthday, but some texts recommend that it be completed before the third or the seventh year. Sometimes, this ritual is combined with the rite of passage of &quot;Upanayana&quot;, the initiation to formal schooling.
Another rite of passage where tonsure is practiced by Hindus is after the death and completing the last rites of an immediate family member, that is father, mother, brother, sister, spouse, or child. This ritual is regionally found in India among male mourners, who shave their heads as a sign of bereavement. Until a few decades ago, many Hindu communities, especially the upper castes, forced widows to undergo the ritual of tonsure and shun good clothes and ornaments, in order to make them unattractive to men.

According to Jamanadas, tonsure was originally a Buddhist custom and was adopted by Hinduism. However, Pandey and others trace the practice to Sanskrit texts dated to have been composed before the birth of Buddha, which mention tonsure as a rite of passage.

==Christianity==
===History and development===
Tonsure was not widely known in antiquity. There were three forms of tonsure known in the 7th and 8th centuries:

* The Oriental consisted of shaving the whole head. This was observed in the Eastern churches, including the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches. Hence Theodore of Tarsus, who had acquired his learning in Byzantine Asia Minor and bore this tonsure, had to allow his hair to grow for four months before he could be tonsured after the Roman fashion, and then ordained Archbishop of Canterbury by Pope Vitalian in 668.
* The Celtic tonsure, the exact shape of which is unclear from the sources, but in some way involved shaving the head from ear to ear. The shape may have been semicircular, arcing forward from a line between the ears, but another popular suggestion, less borne out in the sources, proposes that the entire forehead was shaved back to the ears. More recently a triangular shape, with one point at the front of the head going back to a line between the ears, has been suggested. The Celtic tonsure was worn in Ireland and Great Britain and was connected to the distinct set of practices known as Celtic Christianity. It was opposed by the Roman tradition, but many adherents to the Celtic tradition continued to maintain the old way well into the 8th and 9th centuries. Some sources have also suggested links between this tonsure and that worn by druids in the Pre-Roman Iron Age.
* The Roman: this consisted of shaving only the top of the head, so as to allow the hair to grow in the form of a crown. This is claimed to have originated with Saint Peter, and is the practice of the Latin Church of the Catholic Church.

===Ancient and medieval usage===

====Eastern Christianity====

=====Clerical tonsure=====
St. Germanus I, Patriarch of Constantinople from 715 to 730, writes &quot;The double crown inscribed on the head of the priest through tonsure represents the precious head of the chief-apostle Peter. When he was sent out in the teaching and preaching of the Lord, his head was shaved by those who did not believe his word, as if in mockery. The Teacher Christ blessed this head, changed dishonour into honour, ridicule into praise. He placed on it a crown made not out of precious stones, but one which shines more than gold, topaz, or precious stone – with the stone and rock of faith.” In the Eastern Orthodox Church today, priests, deacons, readers, and other tonsured offices do not have their heads shaved. Rather, four locks of hair are clipped from the top of the head in the shape of a cross to mark their obedience to the Church.

=====Monastic tonsure=====
St. Germanus I writes &quot;The total tonsuring of the head is in imitation of the holy Apostle James, brother of the Lord, and the Apostle Paul, and of the rest.&quot;

====Western Christianity====
=====Clerical tonsure=====
In the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, &quot;first tonsure&quot; was, in medieval times, and generally through to 1972, the rite of inducting someone into the clergy and qualifying him for the civil benefits once enjoyed by clerics. Tonsure was a prerequisite for receiving the minor and major orders. Failing to maintain tonsure was the equivalent of attempting to abandon one&#x27;s clerical state, and in the 1917 Code of Canon Law, any cleric in minor orders (or simply tonsured) who did not resume the tonsure within a month after being warned by his Ordinary lost the clerical state. Over time, the appearance of tonsure varied, ending up for non-monastic clergy as generally consisting of a symbolic cutting of a few tufts of hair at first tonsure in the Sign of the Cross and in wearing a bare spot on the back of the head which varied according to the degree of orders. It was not supposed to be less than the size of a communicant&#x27;s host, even for a tonsuratus, someone simply tonsured, and the approximate size for a priest&#x27;s tonsure was the size of a priest&#x27;s host. Countries that were not Catholic had exceptions to this rule, especially in the English-speaking world. In England and America, for example, the bare spot was dispensed with, likely because of the persecutions that could arise from being a part of the Catholic clergy, but the ceremonious cutting of the hair in the first clerical tonsure was always required. In accordance with Pope Paul VI&#x27;s &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Ministeria quaedam&quot; of 15 August 1972, &quot;first tonsure is no longer conferred&quot;.

=====Monastic tonsure=====
Apart from this general clerical tonsure, some Western Rite monastic orders, for example Carthusians and Trappists, employed a very full version of tonsure, shaving the head entirely bald and keeping only a narrow ring of short hair, sometimes called &quot;the monastic crown&quot; (see &quot;Roman tonsure&quot;, above), from the time of entrance into the monastic novitiate for all monks, whether destined for service as priests or brothers.

===Contemporary practice===
====Eastern Christianity====
Today in Eastern Orthodoxy and in the Eastern Catholic Churches of Byzantine Rite, there are three types of tonsure: baptismal, monastic, and clerical. It always consists of the cutting of four locks of hair in a cruciform pattern: at the front of head as the celebrant says &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot;, at the back of head at the words &quot;and the Son&quot;, and on either side of the head at the words &quot;and the Holy Spirit&quot;. In all cases, the hair is allowed to grow back; the tonsure as such is not adopted as a hairstyle.

=====Baptismal tonsure=====
Baptismal tonsure is performed during the rite of Holy Baptism as a first sacrificial offering by the newly baptised. This tonsure is always performed, whether the one being baptised is an infant or an adult.

=====Monastic tonsure=====
Monastic tonsure (of which there are three grades: Rassophore, Stavrophore and the Great Schema), is the rite of initiation into the monastic state, symbolic of cutting off of self-will. Orthodox monks traditionally never cut their hair or beards after receiving the monastic tonsure as a sign of the consecration of their lives to God (reminiscent of the Vow of the Nazirite).

=====Clerical tonsure=====
Clerical tonsure is the equivalent of the &quot;first tonsure&quot; in the Latin church. It is done immediately prior to ordination to the minor order of reader but is not repeated at subsequent ordinations. This led to a once common usage that one was, for instance, &quot;tonsured a reader&quot;, although technically the tonsure occurs prior to the prayer of ordination within the ordination rite.

====Western Christianity====

=====Clerical tonsure=====
Since the issuing of &quot;Ministeria quaedam&quot; in 1972, certain institutes have been authorized to use the first clerical tonsure, such as the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter (1988), the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest (1990), and the Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney (2001).

Although the tonsure itself is obsolete, the wearing of a skull cap, called a zucchetto, in church to keep the head warm, which the fuller form of clerical tonsure led to, still survives. The zucchetto is worn by the pope (in white), cardinals (in red) and bishops (in purple) both during and outside of formal religious ceremonies. Priests may wear a simple black zucchetto, only outside of religious services, though this is almost never seen except on abbots, who continue to wear the black zucchetto, or abbots of the Order of Canons Regular of Premontre, who wear white. Another congregation of Canons Regular, the Canons Regular of the Lateran, wear a white zucchetto as part of their proper habit. Some priests who held special titles (certain ranks of monsignori and some canons, for instance) formerly wore black zucchettos with red or purple piping, but this too has fallen out of use except in a few, extremely rare cases.

=====Monastic tonsure=====
Some monastic orders and individual monasteries still maintain the tradition of a monastic tonsure. While not required, it is still a common practice of Latin Church friars, such as the Franciscan Missionaries of the Eternal Word. Some references compare the tonsure to the Crown of Thorns worn by Christ at the crucifixion.

==Buddhism==
In Buddhism, tonsure (Sanskrit: &quot;mundanā&quot;) is a part of the rite of &quot;pravrajya&quot; and also a part of becoming a bhikshu (monk) or bhikshuni (nun). This involves shaving the head and face. This tonsure is renewed as often as required to keep the head cleanly shaven.

The Theravada Vinaya stipulates that a monk must shave every two months or when the hair grows two finger-breadths in length. When the Buddha-to-be first cut his hair, the remaining hair curled clockwise to this length, never to grow long again. It is common for the monastic community to shave during the full moon and new moon Uposatha days.

Mahayana tradition varies slightly in its forms of tonsure depending on region. According to the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya commentary (四分律刪繁補闕行事鈔, T. 1804) by Daoxuan, newly-ordained monks should leave one, three, or five small knots of hair (&quot;cūḍā&quot;) that are ceremonially shaved by their teacher when receiving precepts. Chinese Buddhism includes a practice called jieba (戒疤), wherein the monk or nun receives small burns to the scalp to symbolize their adherence to the bodhisattva path.

The &quot;Verse of Tonsure&quot; (&quot;Teihatsu no ge&quot; 剃髮偈) is recited by Soto Zen practitioners:

:In shaving off beard and hair, (teijo shuhatsu 剃除鬚髮; Sanskrit: &quot;śiras-tuṇḍa-muṇḍana&quot;)
:we pray that all living beings (tōgan shujō 當願衆生)
:should forever be free from mental afflictions (yōri bonnō 永離煩惱)
:and in the end attain nirvana. (kugyō jakumetsu 究竟寂滅; Sanskrit: &quot;atyanta-śānta-praśānta&quot;)

Tibetan Buddhist tradition assigns auspicious days depending on when both laypeople and monastics cut their hair. The Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya also regulates the wearing of a special cloth when shaving the head called &quot;keśapratigrahaṇa&quot; (剃髮衣). This is also the name of the shrine built for the Buddha&#x27;s hair before it was enshrined in a stupa in Trāyastriṃśa heaven.

==Judaism==
The purification process of the &quot;metzora&quot; (one afflicted with &quot;tzaraath&quot;) involved the ritual shaving of the &quot;metzorah&#x27;s&quot; entire body except for the afflicted locations.

In an effort to distinguish themselves from ancient practices of tonsure associated with idolatry, by doing the inverse, Orthodox Jewish males do not shave the corners of their beards or scalps with straight blades, as described in Leviticus 19:27.

See also the custom of Upsherin, celebrating a boy&#x27;s first haircut at the age of three.

==Islam==
=== Sunni ===
Partial tonsure is forbidden in Islam. Muhammad forbade shaving one&#x27;s hair on some parts of the head while letting it grow on other parts, as in tonsure. However, shaving the head entirely is allowed. The proscription is detailed in the hadith.

عَنِ ابْنِ عُمَرَ أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ – صلى الله عليه وسلم – نَهَى عَنِ الْقَزَعِ

From Ibnu &#x27;Umar (he says), the Prophet – peace be upon him – forbids the Qaza‘ (i.e. shaving hair on some parts of the head while let it grow on other parts). 
Hadith Bukhari V/2214 no.5577 about &quot;Al-Qaza‘&quot;, and Hadith Muslim III/1675 no.2120, about &quot;the Proscription of Al-Qaza‘&quot;)

 عَنِ ابْنِ عُمَرَ رَأَى النَّبِي صَلَّى الله عَلَيهِ وَسَلَّمَ صَبِياًً قَدْ حلقَ بَعْضَ شَعْرٍ رَأسَه وَ تركَ بَعْضاً فقال: اَحلِقْهُ كُلَّهُ أَوْ دَعْهُ كُلَّهُ 

From Ibnu &#x27;Umar (he says), the Prophet – peace be upon him – saw a boy whose head shaven on some parts and let the hair grow on other parts. Then, the Prophet commands, &quot;Shave the head entirely or let the hair grow entirely&quot; 
Hadith Ahmad II/88, Hadith Abu Dawud no. 4195, and Hadith An-Nasa-i no.5048)

==Secular European==

===Merovingians===
Among the Merovingians, whose rulers were the &quot;long-haired kings&quot;, the ancient custom remained that an unsuccessful pretender or a dethroned king would be tonsured. Then he had to retire to a monastery, but sometimes this lasted only until his hair grew back. Thus Grimoald the Elder, the son of Pippin of Landen, and Dagobert II&#x27;s guardian, seized the throne for his own son and had Dagobert tonsured, thus marking him unfit for kingship, and exiled.

===Byzantine Empire===
The practice of tonsure, coupled with castration, was common for deposed emperors and their sons in Byzantium from around the 8th century, prior to which disfigurement, usually by blinding, was the normal practice.

<text>Gaius Vibius Trebonianus Gallus ( 206 – August 253) was Roman emperor from June 251 to August 253, in a joint rule with his son Volusianus.

==Early life==
Gallus was born in Italy, in a respected senatorial family with Etruscan ancestry, certainly a relation to Appius Annius Trebonius Gallus and Appius Annius Trebonius Gallus. He had two children in his marriage with Afinia Gemina Baebiana: Gaius Vibius Volusianus, later co-emperor, and a daughter, Vibia Galla. His early career was a typical &quot;cursus honorum&quot;, with several appointments, both political and military. He was suffect consul and in 250 was made governor of the Roman province of Moesia Superior, an appointment that showed the confidence of Emperor Decius in him.

==Rise to power==
In June 251, Decius and his co-emperor and son Herennius Etruscus died in the Battle of Abrittus at the hands of the Goths they were supposed to punish for raids into the empire. According to rumours supported by Dexippus (a contemporary Greek historian) and the thirteenth Sibylline Oracle, Decius&#x27; failure was largely owing to Gallus, who had conspired with the invaders. In any case, when the army heard the news, the soldiers proclaimed Gallus emperor, despite Hostilianus, Decius&#x27; surviving son, ascending the imperial throne in Rome. This action of the army, and the fact that Gallus seems to have been on good terms with Decius&#x27; family, makes Dexippus&#x27; allegation improbable. Gallus did not back down from his intention to become emperor, but accepted Hostilian as co-emperor, perhaps to avoid the damage of another civil war. This gesture aimed to present a united front and quell dissent within the ranks of the military and the Senate.

Anxious to secure his position at Rome and stabilize the situation on the Danube frontier, Gallus made peace with the Goths. Peace terms allowed the Goths to leave Roman territory while keeping their captives and plunder. In addition, it was agreed that they would be paid an annual subsidy. Reaching Rome, Gallus&#x27; proclamation was formally confirmed by the Senate, with his son Volusian being appointed Caesar. On 24 June 251, Decius was deified, but by November Hostilian disappears from history—he may have died in an outbreak of plague.

Gallus may have also ordered a localized and uncoordinated persecution of Christians. However, only two incidents are known to us: the exile of Pope Cornelius to Centumcellae, where he died in 253, and the exile of his successor, Pope Lucius, right after his election. The latter was recalled to Rome during the reign of Valerian.

Like his predecessors, Gallus did not have an easy reign. In the East, an Antiochene nobleman, Mariades, revolted and began ravaging Syria and Cappadocia, then fled to the Persians. Gallus ordered his troops to attack the Persians, but Persian Emperor Shapur I invaded Armenia and destroyed a large Roman army, taking it by surprise at Barbalissos in 253. Shapur I then invaded the defenseless Syrian provinces, capturing all of their legionary posts and ravaging their cities, including Antioch, without any response. Persian invasions were repeated in the following year, but now Uranius Antoninus (a priest originally called Sampsiceramus), a descendant of the royal house of Emesa, confronted Shapur and forced him to retreat. Uranius proclaimed himself emperor, however, and minted coins with his image upon them. On the Danube, Scythian tribes were once again on the loose, despite the peace treaty signed in 251. They invaded Asia Minor by sea, burned the great Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, and returned home with plunder. Lower Moesia was also invaded in early 253. Aemilian, governor of Moesia Superior and Pannonia, took the initiative and defeated the invaders.

==Death==
Since the army was no longer pleased with the Emperor, the soldiers proclaimed Aemilian emperor. With a usurper, supported by Pauloctus, threatening the throne, Gallus prepared for a fight. He recalled several legions and ordered reinforcements to return to Rome from Gaul under the command of the future emperor Publius Licinius Valerianus. Despite these dispositions, Aemilian marched onto Italy ready to fight for his claim and caught Gallus at Interamna (modern Terni) before the arrival of Valerian. What exactly happened there is not clear, as sources do not agree with each other. Later sources claim that after an initial defeat, Gallus and Volusian were murdered by their own troops; or Gallus did not have the chance to face Aemilian at all because his army went over to the usurper. In any case, both Gallus and Volusian were killed in August 253. Gallus’s ascension and the subsequent events underscore the delicate balance of power in third century Roman Empire where the survival of an emperor depended not only on alliances and military might but also on the ability to navigate the complexities of political legitimacy and public perception.

<text>Marcus Aemilius Aemilianus ( – September 253), also known as Aemilian, was Roman emperor for three months in 253.

Commander of the Moesian troops, he obtained an important victory against the invading Goths and was, for this reason, acclaimed emperor by his army. He then moved quickly to Roman Italy, where he defeated Emperor Trebonianus Gallus at the Battle of Interamna Nahars in August 253, only to be killed by his own men a month later when another general, Valerian, proclaimed himself emperor and moved against Aemilian with a larger army.

== Origins==
Aemilian was born in the Roman province of Africa. According to the 4th century source &quot;Epitome de Caesaribus&quot;, he was born at &quot;Girba&quot; (modern Djerba, an island off the coast of Tunisia) and was a Moor; a reference in the same source hints that he was born around 207. The 12th-century historian Joannes Zonaras, who calls him a Libyan rather than a Moor, and another chronicle of the 13th century hold that he was forty at the time of his death in 253.

Regarding his lineage, there are two versions, both exaggerated: while Eutropius and his translator Paeanius probably defame a failed usurper when they say that he was from an insignificant family, John of Antioch may refer to Aemilian&#x27;s propaganda when he says that the usurper used his ancestry to take power. His &quot;praenomen&quot; and &quot;nomen&quot;, reinforced by his &quot;cognomen&quot;, suggest a descent from a native African who obtained Roman citizenship during the Second Triumvirate, in which his land was ruled by Lepidus.

Aemilian married Cornelia Supera, a woman of African origin; the year of their marriage is unknown, but since both were from the same place, it is possible they married before Aemilian left Africa.

==Military career==
During the reign of Trebonianus Gallus and his son Volusianus (251–253), Aemilian was sent to the Balkans to command an army. His primary responsibility was to assure peace along the Danube frontier, which had been subject to several attacks by the Goths led by king Cniva.

Gallus secured the throne after the death of Emperor Decius at the hands of Cniva in the Battle of Abrittus (251), and later had to manage an outbreak of plague that devastated Rome. He was not popular with the army, mainly due to humiliating treaties signed in 251 with the Goths and King Shapur I of Persia who attacked Syria. According to John of Antioch, upon his appointment to the Moesian command, Aemilian was already envious of Gallus and plotted treachery against him. He was also an opponent of the Roman Senate, and his seditious plans are confirmed by Jerome and Jordanes.

== Rise ==
In 253, the Goths, led by king Cniva, claimed they had not received the tribute due from the Romans according to the treaty of 251. They crossed the border and attacked Cappadocia, Pessinus, and Ephesus. Modern historians believe that this missing payment was not a change in Roman policy, and the Goths were more likely trying to capitalize on their military prowess. Aemilian had command of the army assigned to defend the area, but the recent defeat at the Battle of Abrittus put his troops on edge. Aemilian exhorted them, reminding them of Roman honor (according to Zosimus) and promising tribute from the Goths (according to Zonaras). The Romans took the Goths by surprise, killing most of them, followed by an invasion of Goth territory resulting in booty and the liberation of prisoners. The Roman soldiers, gathered by Aemilian, acclaimed him emperor. Jordanes claims, however, that Aemilian&#x27;s troops plundered Roman territory, rather than keep the tribute of the Goths.

With his few men, Aemilian left his province unguarded and moved quickly towards Rome to meet the legitimate emperor, Gallus, before the latter could receive reinforcements. While Aemilian descended upon Rome along the Flaminian Way, Gallus and Volusianus had him proclaimed &quot;enemy of the State&quot; by the Roman senate, then exited Rome to meet the usurper. This strategy suggests that Aemilian&#x27;s army was smaller than theirs, as they probably did not expect reinforcements to come in time but trusted their larger army to win the clash. The two armies met at the Battle of Interamna Nahars near modern Terni, at the southern end of the eastern branch of the Flaminia, and Aemilian won the battle; Gallus and Volusianus fled to the north with a few followers, probably as a delay tactic before the arrival of reinforcements, but, in late June or early August 253, at &quot;Forum Flaminii&quot; (modern San Giovanni Profiamma), on the western branch of the Flaminia, they were killed by some of their own guards, who thought that their betrayal could earn them a reward.

Aemilian continued towards Rome. The Roman senate, after a short opposition, decided to recognize him as emperor. According to some sources, Aemilian then wrote to the Senate, promising to fight for the Empire in Thrace and against Persia, and to relinquish his power to the Senate, of which he considered himself a general. Aemilian received the titles of &quot;Pius&quot;, &quot;Felix&quot; and &quot;Pater Patriae&quot;, the &quot;tribunicia potestas&quot;, and was elevated to the rank of &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;; he was not, however, elevated to consulate (possibly a hint of his non-senatorial birth). His coinage shows that his propaganda focused on his capability as a military commander—he defeated the Goths when nobody thought this possible, and thus he was the right man for the job of restoring the power of the Roman Empire.

==Fall==
Valerian, governor of the Rhine provinces, was on his way south with an army which, according to Zosimus, had been called in as a reinforcement by Gallus. But modern historians believe this army, possibly mobilized for an incumbent campaign in the East, moved only after Gallus&#x27; death to support Valerian&#x27;s bid for power. Emperor Aemilian&#x27;s men, fearful of a civil war and Valerian&#x27;s larger force, mutinied. They killed Aemilian at Spoletium or at the Sanguinarium bridge, between Oriculum and Narnia (halfway between Spoletium and Rome), and recognized Valerian as the new emperor. After Aemilian&#x27;s death, which happened between late July and mid-September, a &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; against him was declared. The 4th-century Chronograph of 354 records that he ruled a total of 88 days (the same number as Florianus). Aemilianus&#x27; sole reign was one of the shortest in Rome&#x27;s history, as he only ruled about a month between Trebonianus Gallus&#x27; death and his own murder.

It is possible that the usurper Silbannacus was an officer left by Aemilian in Rome before moving against Valerian, who later tried to become emperor but then was killed.

The life and troubled administration of emperor Aemilian was summarized by the Roman historian Eutropius stating that:

<doc id="146219" wikidata="Q369668" url="?curid=146219" title="William Osler">
<text>Sir William Osler, 1st Baronet, (; July 12, 1849 – December 29, 1919) was a Canadian physician and one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; founding professors of Johns Hopkins Hospital. Osler created the first residency program for specialty training of physicians. He has frequently been described as the &quot;Father of Modern Medicine&quot; and one of the &quot;greatest diagnosticians ever to wield a stethoscope&quot;. In addition to being a physician he was a bibliophile, historian, author, and renowned practical joker. He was passionate about medical libraries and medical history, having founded the History of Medicine Society (formally &quot;section&quot;), at the Royal Society of Medicine, London. He was also instrumental in founding the Medical Library Association of Great Britain and Ireland, and the (North American) Association of Medical Librarians (later the Medical Library Association) along with three other people, including Margaret Charlton, the medical librarian of his alma mater, McGill University. He left his own large history of medicine library to McGill, where it became the Osler Library.

==Biography==

===Family===
William Osler&#x27;s great-grandfather, Edward Osler, was variously described as either a merchant seaman or a pirate. One of William&#x27;s uncles, , a medical officer in the Royal Navy, wrote the &quot;Life of Lord Exmouth&quot; and the poem &quot;The Voyage&quot;.

William Osler&#x27;s father, the Reverend Featherstone Lake Osler (1805–1895), the son of a shipowner at Falmouth, Cornwall, was a former lieutenant in the Royal Navy who served on . In 1831, Featherstone Osler was invited to serve on as the science officer for Charles Darwin&#x27;s historic voyage to the Galápagos Islands, but he turned it down because his father was dying. In 1833, Featherstone Osler announced that he wanted to become a minister of the Church of England.

As a teenager, Featherstone Osler was aboard when it was nearly destroyed by Atlantic storms and remained adrift for weeks. Serving in the Navy, he was shipwrecked off Barbados. In 1837, Featherstone Osler retired from the Navy and emigrated to Canada, becoming a &quot;saddle-bag minister&quot; in rural Upper Canada. When Featherstone and his bride, Ellen Free Picton, arrived in Canada, they were nearly shipwrecked again on Egg Island in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Their children included William, Britton Bath Osler and Sir Edmund Boyd Osler.

===Early life===
William Osler was born in Bond Head, Canada West (Ontario), on July 12, 1849, and raised after 1857 in Dundas, Ontario. He was named William after William of Orange, who won the Battle of the Boyne on July 12, 1690. Osler&#x27;s mother, who was very religious, prayed that he would become a priest. Osler was educated at Trinity College School (then located in Weston, Ontario).

In 1867, Osler announced that he would follow his father&#x27;s footsteps into the ministry and entered Trinity College of the University of Toronto, in the autumn. However, he became increasingly interested in medical science under the influence of James Bovell and the Rev. William Arthur Johnson, encouraging him to switch his career.
In 1868, Osler enrolled in the Toronto School of Medicine, a privately owned institution that was not part of the Medical Faculty of the University of Toronto. Osler lived with James Bovell for a time, and through Johnson, he was introduced to the writings of Sir Thomas Browne; his &quot;Religio Medici&quot; caused a deep impression on him. Osler left the Toronto School of Medicine after being accepted into the MDCM program at the McGill University Faculty of Medicine in Montreal, and he received his medical degree (MDCM) in 1872.

===Career===
Following post-graduate training under Rudolf Virchow in Germany, Osler returned to the McGill University Faculty of Medicine as a professor in 1874. There he created the first formal journal club, showed interest in comparative pathology, and is considered the first to have taught veterinary pathology in North America as part of a broad understanding of disease pathogenesis. In 1884, he was appointed Chair of Clinical Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and in 1885, was one of the seven founding members of the Association of American Physicians, a society dedicated to &quot;the advancement of scientific and practical medicine.&quot; When he left Philadelphia in 1889, his farewell address, &quot;Aequanimitas&quot;, was about the imperturbability (calm amid storm) and equanimity (moderated emotion, tolerance) necessary for physicians.

In 1889, he became the first Physician-in-Chief of the new Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1893, Osler was instrumental in creating the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and became one of the school&#x27;s first professors of medicine. Osler quickly enhanced his reputation as a clinician, humanitarian, and teacher. He presided over the rapidly expanding hospital&#x27;s first year of operation, when it had 220 beds and 788 patients were seen for a total of over 15,000 days of treatment. Sixteen years later, when Osler left for Oxford, over 4,200 patients were seen for a total of nearly 110,000 days of treatment.

In 1905, he was appointed to the Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford, which he held until his death. He was also a Student (fellow) of Christ Church, Oxford.

In the UK, he initiated the founding in 1907 of the Association of Physicians and was founding Senior Editor of its publication the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Medicine&quot; until his death.
In 1911, he founded the Postgraduate Medical Association and was its first President. The same year, Osler was named a baronet in the Coronation Honours List for his contributions to the field of medicine.

In January 1919 he was appointed President of the Fellowship of Medicine and was in October appointed founding President of the merged Fellowship of Medicine and Postgraduate Medical Association, which became the Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine.

The largest collection of Osler&#x27;s letters and papers is at the Osler Library of McGill University in Montreal and a collection is also held at the United States National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.

==Assessment==

Perhaps Osler&#x27;s greatest influence on medicine was to insist that students learn from seeing and talking to patients and the establishment of the medical residency. The latter idea spread across the English-speaking world and remains in place today in most teaching hospitals. Through this system, physicians in training make up much of a teaching hospital&#x27;s medical staff. The success of his residency system depended, in large part, on its pyramidal structure with many interns, fewer assistant residents and a single chief resident, who originally occupied that position for years. While at Hopkins, Osler established the full-time, sleep-in residency system whereby staff physicians lived in the administration building of the hospital. As established, the residency was open-ended, and long tenure was the rule. Physicians spent as long as seven or eight years as residents, during which time they led a restricted, almost monastic life.

He wrote in an essay &quot;Books and Men&quot; that &quot;He who studies medicine without books sails an uncharted sea, but he who studies medicine without patients does not go to sea at all.&quot; His best-known saying was &quot;Listen to your patient, he is telling you the diagnosis&quot;, which emphasises the importance of taking a good history.

The contribution to medical education of which he was proudest was his idea of clinical clerkship – having third- and fourth-year students work with patients on the wards. He pioneered the practice of bedside teaching, making rounds with a handful of students, demonstrating what one student referred to as his method of &quot;incomparably thorough physical examination.&quot; Soon after arriving in Baltimore, Osler insisted that his medical students attend at bedside early in their training. By their third year they were taking patient histories, performing physicals and doing lab tests examining secretions, blood and excreta.

He reduced the role of didactic lectures and once said he hoped his tombstone would say only, &quot;He brought medical students into the wards for bedside teaching.&quot; He also said, &quot;I desire no other epitaph … than the statement that I taught medical students in the wards, as I regard this as by far the most useful and important work I have been called upon to do.&quot; Osler fundamentally changed medical teaching in North America, and this influence, helped by a few such as the Dutch internist P. K. Pel, spread to medical schools across the globe.

Osler was a prolific author and a great collector of books and other material relevant to the history of medicine. He willed his library to the Faculty of Medicine of McGill University where it now forms the nucleus of McGill University&#x27;s Osler Library of the History of Medicine. Osler was a strong supporter of libraries and served on the library committees at most of the universities at which he taught and was a member of the Board of Curators of the Bodleian Library in Oxford. He was instrumental in founding the Medical Library Association in North America, alongside employee and mentee Marcia Croker Noyes, and served as its second president from 1901 to 1904. In Britain he was the first (and only) president of the Medical Library Association of Great Britain and Ireland and also a president of the Bibliographical Society of London (1913).

Osler was a prolific author and public speaker and his public speaking and writing were both done in a clear, lucid style. His most famous work, &quot;The Principles and Practice of Medicine&quot; quickly became a key text to students and clinicians alike. It continued to be published in many editions until 2001 and was translated into many languages. It is notable in part for supporting the use of bloodletting as recently as 1923. Though his own textbook was a major influence in medicine for many years, Osler described Avicenna as the &quot;author of the most famous medical textbook ever written&quot;. He noted that Avicenna&#x27;s &quot;Canon of Medicine&quot; remained &quot;a medical bible for a longer time than any other work&quot;. Osler&#x27;s essays were important guides to physicians. The title of his most famous essay, &quot;Aequanimitas&quot;, espousing the importance of imperturbability, is the motto on the Osler family crest and is used on the Osler housestaff tie and scarf at Hopkins.

==Controversies==

===Racism===
Osler said Canada should be a &quot;white man&#x27;s country&quot; in a 1914 speech given around the time of the Komagata Maru incident involving immigration from India.
Osler wrote &quot;I hate Latin Americans&quot; in a letter to Henry Vining Ogden.
Under the pseudonym &quot;Egerton Yorrick Davis&quot;, Osler mocked Indigenous people: &quot;Every primitive tribe retains some vile animal habit not yet eliminated in the upward march of the race.&quot;
Uncovering this historical context, the journalists David Bruser and Markus Grill and the archivist Nils Seethaler reconstruct the shipment of several indigenous skulls by Osler from Canada to Germany, which were (previously unknown) in the custody of the State Museums of Berlin.

===Gerontology===
Osler is well known in the field of gerontology for the speech he gave when leaving Hopkins to become the Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford. &quot;The Fixed Period&quot;, given on February 22, 1905, included some controversial words about old age. Osler, who had a well-developed humorous side to his character, was in his mid-fifties when he gave the speech and in it he mentioned Anthony Trollope&#x27;s &quot;The Fixed Period&quot; (1882), which envisaged a college where men retired at 67 and after being given a year to settle their affairs, would be &quot;peacefully extinguished by chloroform&quot;. He claimed that, &quot;the effective, moving, vitalizing work of the world is done between the ages of twenty-five and forty&quot; and it was downhill from then on. Osler&#x27;s speech was covered by the popular press which headlined their reports with &quot;Osler recommends chloroform at sixty&quot;. The concept of mandatory euthanasia for humans after a &quot;fixed period&quot; (often 60 years) became a recurring theme in 20th century science fiction—for example, Isaac Asimov&#x27;s 1950 novel &quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot; and Half a Life (Star Trek: The Next Generation). In the 3rd edition of his Textbook, he also coined the description of pneumonia as &quot;the friend of the aged&quot; since it allowed elderly individuals a quick, comparatively painless death: &quot;Taken off by it in an acute, short, not often painful illness, the old man escapes those &#x27;cold gradations of decay&#x27; so distressing to himself and his friends.&quot; Coincidentally, Osler himself died of pneumonia.

==Personal life and family==
An inveterate prankster, he wrote several humorous pieces under the pseudonym &quot;Egerton Yorrick Davis&quot;, even fooling the editors of the &quot;Philadelphia Medical News&quot; into publishing a report on the extremely rare phenomenon of &quot;penis captivus&quot;, on December 13, 1884. The letter was apparently a response to a report on the phenomenon of vaginismus reported three weeks previously in the &quot;Philadelphia Medical News&quot; by Osler&#x27;s colleague Theophilus Parvin. Davis, a prolific writer of letters to medical societies, purported to be a retired U.S. Army surgeon living in Caughnawaga, Quebec (now Kahnawake), author of a fake paper on the obstetrical habits of Native American tribes that was intended as a joke on his rival, Dr. William A. Molson. The piece was never published in Osler&#x27;s lifetime, nor was it intended to be published; Osler knew the content was outrageous, but he wanted to make a fool of Molson by getting the piece to the brink of publication in the &quot;Montreal Medical Journal&quot;, of which Molson was the editor. Osler would enhance Davis&#x27;s myth by signing Davis&#x27;s name to hotel registers and medical conference attendance lists; Davis was eventually reported drowned in the Lachine Rapids in 1884.

Throughout his life, Osler was a great admirer of the 17th century physician and philosopher Sir Thomas Browne.

He died at the age of 70, on December 29, 1919, in Oxford, during the Spanish flu epidemic, most likely of complications from undiagnosed bronchiectasis. His wife, Grace, lived another nine years but succumbed to a series of strokes. Sir William and Lady Osler&#x27;s ashes now rest in a niche in the Osler Library at McGill University. They had two sons, one of whom died shortly after birth. The other, Edward Revere Osler, was mortally wounded in combat in World War I at the age of 21, during the 3rd battle of Ypres (also known as the battle of Passchendaele). At the time of his death in August 1917, he was a second lieutenant in the (British) Royal Field Artillery; Lt. Osler&#x27;s grave is in the Dozinghem Military Cemetery in West Flanders, Belgium. According to one biographer, Osler was emotionally crushed by the loss; he was particularly anguished by the fact that his influence had been used to procure a military commission for his son, who had mediocre eyesight. Lady Osler (Grace Revere) was born in Boston in 1854; her paternal great-grandfather was Paul Revere. In 1876, she married Samuel W. Gross, chairman of surgery at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia and son of Dr. Samuel D. Gross. Gross died in 1889 and in 1892 she married William Osler who was then professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University.

Osler was a founding donor of the American Anthropometric Society, a group of academics who pledged to donate their brains for scientific study. His brain was donated to the American Anthropometric Society after his death and is currently stored at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia. A study of his brain, conducted in 1927, concluded that there were differences between the brains of the highly intelligent and normal brains. In April 1987 it was taken to the Mütter Museum, on 22nd Street near Chestnut in Philadelphia where it was displayed during the annual meeting of the American Osler Society. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1885.

In 1925, a biography of William Osler was written by Harvey Cushing, who received the 1926 Pulitzer Prize for the work. A later biography by Michael Bliss was published in 1999. In 1994 Osler was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame.

==Eponyms==
Osler lent his name to a number of diseases, signs and symptoms, as well as to a number of buildings that have been named for him.

===Conditions===

* Osler&#x27;s sign is an artificially high systolic blood pressure reading due to the calcification of atherosclerotic arteries
* Osler&#x27;s nodes are raised tender nodules on the pulps of fingertips or toes, suggestive of subacute bacterial endocarditis. Osler described them as &quot;ephemeral spots of a painful nodular erythema, chiefly in the skin of the hands and feet.&quot; Osler nodes are usually painful, as opposed to Janeway lesions which are due to emboli and are painless.
* Osler–Weber–Rendu disease (also known as &quot;hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia&quot;) is a syndrome of multiple vascular malformations on the skin, in the nasal and oral mucosa, in the lungs and elsewhere.
* Osler–Vaquez disease (also known as Polycythemia vera)
* Osler–Libman–Sacks syndrome is an atypical, verrucous, nonbacterial, valvular and mural endocarditis. Final stage of systemic lupus erythematosus.
* Osler&#x27;s manoeuvre: in pseudohypertension, the blood pressure as measured by the sphygmomanometer is artificially high because of arterial wall calcification. Osler&#x27;s manoeuvre takes a patient who has a palpable, although pulseless, radial artery while the blood pressure cuff is inflated above systolic pressure; thus they are considered to have &quot;Osler&#x27;s sign&quot;.
*Osler&#x27;s rule: States that a neurological defect has to be related to a specific lesion, in contrast to Hickam&#x27;s dictum, which states that the neurological defect can be due to several lesions.
* Osler&#x27;s syndrome is a syndrome of recurrent episodes of colic pain, with typical radiation to back, cold shiverings and fever; due to the presence in Vater&#x27;s diverticulum of a free-moving gallstone which is larger than the orifice.
* Osler&#x27;s triad (also known as Austrian Syndrome): association of pneumonia, endocarditis, and meningitis.

===Zoological taxonomy===
* Sphryanura osleri is a trematode worm found in the gills of a newt.
* Oslerus osleri is a metastrongyloid nematode lungworm parasite of wild and domestic canids. Osler discovered the parasite while teaching comparative pathology at McGill.

<text>This Hour Has 22 Minutes (commonly shortened to 22 Minutes since 2009) is a weekly Canadian television comedy that airs on CBC Television. Launched in 1993 during Canada&#x27;s 35th general election, the show focuses on Canadian politics with a combination of news parody, sketch comedy, and satirical editorials. Originally featuring Cathy Jones, Rick Mercer, Greg Thomey, and Mary Walsh, the series featured satirical sketches of the weekly news and Canadian political events. The show&#x27;s format is a mock news program, intercut with comic sketches, parody commercials, and humorous interviews of public figures.

Its full name is a parody of &quot;This Hour Has Seven Days&quot;, a CBC news magazine from the 1960s; the &quot;22 Minutes&quot; refers to the fact that a half-hour television program in Canada and the US is typically 22 minutes long with eight minutes of commercials. Jones and Walsh had previously worked together on the sketch comedy series &quot;CODCO&quot;, on which Thomey sometimes appeared as a guest. Mercer had been a notable young writer and performer on his own, touring several successful one-man shows of comedic political commentary. Salter Street Films produced the series until the 2003–2004 season. Salter Street was acquired in 2001 by Alliance Atlantis, and production of the series was transferred directly to Alliance Atlantis in the twelfth season. In 2005 Halifax Film, a new company formed by Salter co-founder Michael Donovan, took over production of the show. In 2006, Halifax Film merged with Decode Entertainment to form DHX Media (now WildBrain), which has produced the show since. In 2019, the rights were sold to IoM Media Ventures, which acquired DHX&#x27;s Halifax studio the year prior.

Recognized with 24 Gemini Awards and 11 Canadian Comedy Awards, &quot;22 Minutes&quot; is taped before a live audience in within the old World Trade Centre in downtown Halifax, Nova Scotia. Its 28th season was taped at the Light House Arts Centre in Halifax with a smaller audience and crew. The series, which originally aired on Mondays for several seasons and later on Fridays, currently airs Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m. on CBC. The series formerly followed the &quot;Rick Mercer Report&quot;.

==Cast==
Although each cast member&#x27;s real name was always shown at the beginning of each episode, at the end of most episodes prior to 2006, one cast member would sign off using their anchor character&#x27;s name, which is noted below where known. This has now been discontinued, and anchors now regularly address each other by their real names.

===Current members===
* Mark Critch (2003–present), as anchor (formerly &quot;Bas MacLaren&quot;, apparently in homage to two well-known Newfoundland radio announcers, Bas Jamieson and George MacLaren) and various correspondents and sketch characters. 
* Trent McClellan (2017–present) as anchor and various correspondents and sketch characters.
* Aba Amuquandoh (2021–present) as anchor and various correspondents and sketch characters.
* Stacey McGunnigle (2021–present) as anchor and various correspondents and sketch characters.
* Chris Wilson (2023-present) as anchor and various correspondents and sketch characters.

For the 2020 season, the show added Nik Sexton, Tom Stanley and Jon Sturge as field reporters covering the 2020 United States elections. 

In addition to the main cast, some members of the show&#x27;s writing team, including Heidi Brander, Adam Christie, Sophie Buddle, Aisha Brown, Nadine Bhabha, Isabel Kanaan, Brandon Ash-Mohammed, Travis Lindsay, Ajahnis Charley, Dan Dillabough and Leonard Chan, also appear in sketches as supporting players. Wilson was promoted to a full cast member in the 2023-24 season, after having also been a writer and supporting player since 2021.

===Former members===
* Cathy Jones (1993–2021) as anchor (formerly &quot;Sydney Dubizzenchyk&quot;, a reference to former CBC anchor Tina Srebotnjak, who had become the host of &quot;Midday&quot; in 1992) and various correspondents and sketch characters. Jones was the longest running anchor in the show&#x27;s history, and the last of the show&#x27;s four original cast members to leave.
* Rick Mercer (1993–2001) as anchor &quot;J. B. Dickson&quot; and various correspondents and sketch characters. Mercer left the show to devote more time to &quot;Made in Canada&quot;; after that show ended he launched &quot;Rick Mercer Report&quot;, a series similar to &quot;22 Minutes&quot;.
* Colin Mochrie (2001–2003) as anchor &quot;Anthony St. George&quot; and various correspondents and sketch characters. Mochrie left the show after two seasons to pursue his own projects and other movie roles, returning to guest star on the January 27, 2006 episode. Mochrie was the first change to the original cast, following the departure of Rick Mercer.
* Mary Walsh (1993–2004) as anchor &quot;Molly McGuire&quot; and various correspondents and sketch characters. Walsh appeared less often in season 11 and left the series to pursue her film career and to host &quot;Mary Walsh: Open Book&quot;, a CBC series in which she moderated a celebrity panel discussing books and literature. Walsh has returned to the show several times as a guest since her departure, most notably for a 2011 appearance in which Walsh, in character as Marg Delahunty, accosted controversial Toronto mayor Rob Ford in his driveway.
* Greg Thomey (1993–2005) as anchor &quot;Frank MacMillan&quot; and various correspondents and sketch characters. Thomey appeared less often in season 12 and left the show in 2006. In season 22, Thomey has been appearing as a regular guest.
* Geri Hall (2007–2011), as anchor and various correspondents and sketch characters. Hall had previously been a fill-in anchor in fall 2004 and March 2007.
* Gavin Crawford (2003–2011) as anchor (formerly &quot;Gavin Cooper&quot;, a possible homage to Anderson Cooper) and various correspondents and sketch characters.
* Shaun Majumder (2003–2010, 2011–2018) as anchor (formerly &quot;Tucker T. Bartlett&quot;) and various correspondents and sketch characters. He appeared less often in his last couple of years with the show, and eventually left the series to star on &quot;Detroit 1-8-7&quot;, but returned to the show starting in the 19th season. He was fired from the show in June 2018 and made it public in August 2018, citing creative differences with a producer.
* Susan Kent (2012–2020) as anchor and various correspondents and sketch characters.

==Regular characters and segments==
; Talking to Americans
: Rick Mercer tours the United States, talking to Americans as if from a Canadian news program, asking them about &quot;Canadian issues&quot;. The object is to see how little some Americans know about their northern neighbours. The piece was so popular that the CBC had Mercer create a one-hour TV special based on the segment. It became the highest rated comedy special in Canadian television history when it aired on Canada Day, 2001. Popular bits include Mercer getting Americans to say &quot;Congratulations Canada on legalizing VCRs!&quot; and getting a professor at Princeton University to sign a petition against the re-starting of the Annual Toronto Polar Bear Hunt. In an election 2000 segment, he convinced then-Governor of Texas George W. Bush that Canada&#x27;s Prime Minister Jean Chrétien was named Jean Poutine and that he was supporting Bush&#x27;s candidacy. The success of the CBC special got Mercer attention on numerous American media outlets, including ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot;. Mercer abandoned the concept after September 11, 2001.

; Babe Bennett
: A &quot;22 Minutes&quot; &quot;sexual affairs correspondent&quot; played by Cathy Jones, Babe is a sassy suffragette, 1940s style, who talks about sexual matters. She ends each segment by saying &quot;I&#x27;m just goofin&#x27; around!&quot; 
; Marg Delahunty
: Mary Walsh crashes press conferences, hosts a &quot;sleepover&quot; for the nation&#x27;s leading female (and gay) politicians, and threatens to &quot;smite&quot; the likes of politicians as &quot;Marg Princess Warrior&quot; (a loose parody of ).

; Misses Enid &amp; Eulalia

(The characters were normally introduced as &quot;the Misses Enid and Eulalia&quot;, meaning &quot;Miss Enid and Miss Eulalia&quot;, but this was frequently misunderstood by viewers as &quot;Mrs. Enid&quot; and &quot;Eulalia&quot; without an honorific.) The characters were later reunited in the CBC Gem web series &quot;Broad Appeal: Living with E&#x27;s&quot;.
; Streeters, aka The Rant.

;Max Pointy: A spoof of CBC personality Rex Murphy&#x27;s political commentaries for &quot;The National&quot;, performed by Colin Mochrie. Max would start off with a legitimate political issue but end up on an unrelated and generally inane point by the end of his rant. Discontinued when Mochrie left the show. 
;That Show Sucked!: with Ma and Eddie Reardon (portrayed by Mary Walsh &amp; Greg Thomey) who make fun of TV shows, with Ma saying that whatever show that Eddie watches &quot;Suck&quot; and constantly demanding that he give her &quot;the G. D. clickerbox&quot;. Discontinued when Walsh left the show.

Usually interviewed by Mercer&#x27;s character J. B. Dickson, the Quints would boast about something outlandish that Dickson has a hard time believing until one of the quints (usually Jones) spills the beans and reveals that what they were promoting was really a scam. Discontinued when Mochrie left the show.
;Inside Media Counter-spin: A satirical talk show with the host, Heather Coulter, portrayed by Cathy Jones. The host makes blatantly stereotypical statements about her guests. 
;Panic Room with Betty Hope: Host Betty Hope (played by Cathy Jones) parodies Nancy Grace in &quot;breaking news&quot; style segments, in which she interviews someone knowledgeable about a given threat and then spins the facts to make them sound more dramatic and dangerous.

; Jerry Boyle
: a Newfoundland separatist whose campaign slogan is &quot;If you can mark an X, you&#x27;re my kind of people!&quot; The character was created as a recurring character on &quot;CODCO&quot;.

; Ottawa Gargoyle
: A gargoyle who sits on top of the Parliament buildings and satirizes politicians, occasionally throwing hot oil on them.

;Tim MacMillan
:Foreign correspondent who&#x27;s (almost) never where he&#x27;s supposed to be. He&#x27;s also Frank MacMillan&#x27;s brother. His segments would open with a recurring style of dialogue. &quot;Hello, Tim?&quot; &quot;HELLLOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!&quot; &quot;Are you in Geneva?&quot; [pause.] &quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!&quot;

===Walsh&#x27;s characters===
; Connie Bloor
: A &quot;22 Minutes&quot; Prairie correspondent played by Mary Walsh, who reports from a donut shop. Introduced in each segment by the line: &quot;She&#x27;s flat as the prairies and twice as wide&quot;, she wears a tuque and earmuffs, and her speech is punctuated with a series of snorts. One of her recurring gags involves feeding paper printouts of celebrities and politicians through a paper shredder.

; Marg Delahunty
: A &quot;22 Minutes&quot; correspondent played by Walsh, Marg Delahunty is an interviewer whose specialty is finding suspectible politicians and hounding them with off-the-cuff interviews designed to satirize and even embarrass them. Some of these interviews were conducted in the guise of &quot;Marg, Princess Warrior&quot;, a parody of the title character of &quot;&quot; portrayed by Lucy Lawless.

; Dakey Dunn
: A &quot;22 Minutes&quot; &quot;Male Correspondent&quot; played by Walsh, replete with gold chain, hairy chest, cigarette and beer, who regularly lays out a macho view of economic and cultural matters. This character was earlier used in the &quot;CODCO&quot; series. Dakey also once accosted Margaret Atwood at a book signing, reciting one of her most famous poems over and over again.

==Famous stunts==

===Jean Poutine===

1999–2000 – During the 2000 American election, Rick Mercer approached Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush on a campaign stop in Michigan, asking for comment on the news that Bush had received the endorsement of Canadian prime minister &quot;Jean Poutine&quot;. The then-prime minister&#x27;s name was Jean Chrétien, and he had not endorsed Bush – it is standard practice for the Canadian government not to endorse anyone in a foreign election.

Bush – who had previously stated that &quot;you can&#x27;t stump me on world leaders&quot; – acknowledged the purported endorsement with a short statement to the &quot;22 Minutes&quot; cameras, which aired as part of the show&#x27;s regular &quot;Talking to Americans&quot; feature. The Talking To Americans segments – and eventual one-hour special – were produced and directed by Geoff D&#x27;Eon.

In his first official state visit to Canada four years later, Bush joked that his &quot;one regret&quot; about the visit was that he&#x27;d &quot;hoped to meet Jean Poutine.&quot;

===Stockwell/Doris petition===

2000–01 – Often cited as the show&#x27;s best joke, the sketch was aired during the 2000 federal election campaign, and consisted of a staged rant by Rick Mercer.

During the 2000 federal election, then-Canadian Alliance leader Stockwell Day proposed a mechanism to call for a referendum. A petition on any particular subject which gathered at least 350,000 signatures of voting age citizens (&quot;3% of the electors&quot;) would automatically trigger a national referendum.

Mercer&#x27;s &quot;rant&quot; asked viewers to log on to the &quot;22 Minutes&quot; website, and sign an online petition asking the party leader to change his name to Doris Day (after the singer/actress). Mercer wanted the petition to involve Day changing his name while the Doris Day reference was suggested by &quot;22 Minutes&quot; writer Luciano Casimiri. Producers claim to have obtained in excess of 1,200,000 online votes. This was cheerfully admitted to be a stunt unhampered by the rigours of an Elections Canada-controlled petition. Although the sketch had no effect on Alliance policy, it did obtain international publicity for the show and contributed to the general air of farce surrounding Day&#x27;s election campaign. Day&#x27;s response to the petition was, &quot;&quot;Que será, será&quot;.&quot;

===Oilers vs Canadiens===

2003–04 – Shaun Majumder, in character as &quot;Raj Binder&quot;, was sent to report on the 2003 outdoors Edmonton Oilers and Montreal Canadiens old timers game, preceding the night&#x27;s actual NHL regular season game, which was the first NHL game to be played outdoors (at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton). Majumder actually snuck into all the team photos, causing uproar from the event&#x27;s unwitting organizers in the days after, when the photos were released to the press.

===Marg ambushes Rob Ford===
On October 24, 2011, Walsh reprised the role of &quot;Marg, Princess Warrior&quot;, conducting an ambush interview of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford at his home, which aired on &quot;22 Minutes&quot; the following evening. Ford&#x27;s reaction and alleged verbal abuse directed at a 911 operator made national headlines. Ford claimed that he had never seen nor heard of &quot;22 Minutes&quot;.

==Controversies==

On November 17, 2004, clips of a sketch for &quot;22 Minutes&quot; were released, in which Liberal MP Carolyn Parrish stomped on a George W. Bush doll and performed voodoo on its head, where she said &quot;it would do the least damage&quot;. The incident sparked significant outrage from the opposition Conservatives, who argued that it had the potential to damage diplomatic relations between Canada and the United States. As a result of the incident Parrish was expelled from the Liberal Party and sat the remainder of her term as an Independent.

Richard Martineau wrote a column in &quot;Le Journal de Montréal&quot; criticizing a sketch aired October 7, 2007, entitled &quot;Quebec Nation&quot;. In the sketch, two characters discussed the state of affairs after a separation from Canada, which left them with &quot;no roads, no towns, not even radio. The only things we take is our racism&quot;. Martineau also discussed the fact that &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; is broadcast by the CBC and is funded by funds also coming from Quebec.

In May 2015, the American sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; aired a sketch in which a contestant on a &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot;-style game show panicked at being asked to draw the Muslim prophet Muhammad, igniting allegations that &quot;SNL&quot; had plagiarized a nearly identical sketch which aired on &quot;22 Minutes&quot; in January.

== Middle Ages ==

===8th century===
;700–1250: Period of the Gaonim (the Gaonic era). Most Jews lived in the Muslim Arab realm (Andalusia, North Africa, Palestine, Iraq and Yemen), others living in Christian southern Europe and Asia Minor. Despite general discrimination and sporadic periods of persecution in this period, Jewish communal and cultural life flowered. The universally recognized centers of Jewish life were in Jerusalem and Tiberias (Syria), Sura and Pumbeditha (Iraq).

===10th century===
;912–1013: The Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain. Abd-ar-Rahman III becomes Caliph of Spain in 912, ushering in the height of tolerance. Muslims granted Jews and Christians exemptions from military service, the right to their own courts of law, and a guarantee of safety of their property.

With the decline of Muslim and Jewish centers of power in Iraq, there was no single place in the world which was a recognized authority for deciding matters of Jewish law and practice. Consequently, the rabbis recognized the need for writing commentaries on the Torah and Talmud and for writing law codes that would allow Jews anywhere in the world to be able to continue living in the Jewish tradition.

<text>Gouda cheese (, , ; , &quot;cheese from Gouda&quot;) is a creamy, yellow cow&#x27;s milk cheese originating from the Netherlands. It is one of the most popular and produced cheeses worldwide. The name is used today as a general term for numerous similar cheeses produced in the traditional Dutch manner.

==History==

The cheese is named after the city of Gouda, South Holland because it was traded there. In the Middle Ages, Dutch cities could obtain certain feudal rights which gave them primacy or a total monopoly on certain goods. Within the County of Holland, Gouda acquired market rights on cheese, the sole right to have a market in which the county&#x27;s farmers could sell their cheese. All the cheeses would be taken to the market square in Gouda to be sold. Teams consisting of the guild of cheese-porters, identified by distinct differently coloured straw hats, carried the farmers&#x27; cheeses, which typically weighed about , in barrows. Buyers then sampled the cheeses and negotiated a price using a ritual bargaining system called in which buyers and sellers clap each other&#x27;s hands and shout out various prices. Once a price was agreed upon, the porters would carry the cheese to the weighing house and complete the sale. Modern Gouda had evolved by the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century.

Cheesemaking traditionally was a woman&#x27;s task in Dutch culture, with farmers&#x27; wives passing their cheesemaking skills onto their daughters. Most Dutch Gouda is now produced industrially. However, some 300 Dutch farmers still produce &quot;boerenkaas&quot; (&quot;farmer&#x27;s cheese&quot;), which is a protected form of Gouda made in the traditional manner, using unpasteurised milk.

==Process==

Various sources suggest that the term &quot;Gouda&quot; refers more to a general style of cheesemaking rather than to a specific kind of cheese, pointing to its taste, which varies with age. Young (and factory-produced) Gouda has been described as having a flavour that is &quot;lightly fudgy with nuts, but very, very, very mild&quot;, while a more mature farmhouse Gouda has a &quot;lovely fruity tang&quot; with a &quot;sweet finish&quot;, that may take on &quot;an almost butterscotch flavour&quot; if aged over two years.

After cultured milk is curdled, some of the whey is drained and water is added to the batch. This is called &quot;washing the curd&quot;; it creates a sweeter cheese by removing some of the lactose, resulting in a reduction of lactic acid produced. About 10% of the mixture is curds, which are pressed into circular moulds for several hours. These moulds are the essential reason behind its traditional, characteristic shape. The cheese is then soaked in a brine solution, which gives the cheese and its rind a distinctive taste.

The cheese is dried for a few days before being coated with a yellow wax or plastic-like coating to prevent it from drying out. It is then aged, which hardens the cheese and develops its flavor. Dutch cheese makers generally use six gradations, or categories, to classify the cheese:
# Young cheese (4 weeks)
# Young matured (8–10 weeks)
# Matured (16–18 weeks)
# Extra matured (7–9 months)
# Old cheese (10–12 months)
# Very old cheese (12 months to 20 months)

As it ages, it develops a caramel sweetness and has a slight crunchiness from cheese crystals, especially in older cheeses. In the Netherlands, cubes of Gouda are often eaten as a snack served with Dutch mustard. Older varieties are sometimes topped with sugar or apple butter. Cubes of Gouda are commonly served as a snack along with beer in traditional Dutch Brown Bars.

== Sensory and chemical properties ==

=== Chemical properties ===
The amount of moisture that is present in Gouda cheese plays an important part in determining its texture; cheeses that include higher moisture levels tend to be softer and more creamy, whilst cheeses that have a lower moisture levels tend to be stiffer and may develop a crystalline structure as they age. In most cases, Gouda cheese has a high moisture content, falling in the range of 40% to 50%.

A cheese&#x27;s fat content not only contributes to its texture, but also contributes to its flavor, and affects its melting properties. The fat content allows for the transportation and release of flavour-enhancing chemicals, increasing the cheese&#x27;s overall flavour profile. Gouda cheese has a variable fat content, typically ranging from 20% to 40%. 

Certain aroma-active chemicals found in Gouda cheese are responsible for the cheese&#x27;s distinctive flavour, which can be traced back to six components:

* Diacetyl
* 2-Methylbutanal
* 3-Methylbutanal
* Methional
* Ethyl butyrate
* Acetic acid

Casein (the primary protein found in cows&#x27; milk) is the predominant type of protein found in gouda cheese, leading to the cheese&#x27;s high protein content. During the manufacturing process, casein coagulates to create curds, contributing to the cheese&#x27;s stiffness and overall structure.

=== Flavour ===
Gouda cheese is recognised for its diverse flavour profile. Depending on its age, Gouda cheese can exhibit a wide range of flavour qualities: from mild and creamy, to harsh and acidic. These flavours develop as Gouda cheeses reach the medium stage of maturation; showing extra whey, sour aromatics, and a somewhat cooked or milky essence are indicators of the cheese&#x27;s increasing complexity. Matured Gouda has a rich, caramel-like flavour, developed after prolonged ripening, along with brothy and malty or nutty undertones. Depending on how long the cheese has been aged, the finish can range from silky to sharp.

=== Appearance and texture ===
Gouda cheese has a solid and springy texture. Young Gouda cheese often has a smooth, creamy texture and a pale ivory to light yellow colour. Over time, the cheese&#x27;s appearance changes into a richer golden hue, and its texture becomes more crumbly and firm. Gouda cheese obtains a harder, crystalline appearance as it ages, where small crystals may be visible.

== Nutritional value ==

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, some of the Gouda cheese nutritional facts are listed below.
==Protection==
The term &quot;Gouda&quot; is not restricted to cheese of Dutch origin. However, &quot;Boerenkaas&quot;, &quot;Noord-Hollandse Gouda&quot;, and &quot;Gouda Holland&quot; are protected geographical indications in the European Union. These cheeses can only be made in the Netherlands (although not only in the Dutch provinces of North Holland and South Holland, in which Gouda is situated) and can only use milk produced by Dutch cows.

<text>A sports car is a type of car that is designed with an emphasis on dynamic performance, such as handling, acceleration, top speed, the thrill of driving, and racing capability. Sports cars originated in Europe in the early 1910s and are currently produced by many manufacturers around the world.

==Definition==
Definitions of sports cars often relate to how the car design is optimised for dynamic performance, without any specific minimum requirements; both a Triumph Spitfire and Ferrari 488 Pista can be considered sports cars, despite vastly different levels of performance. Broader definitions of sports cars include cars &quot;in which performance takes precedence over carrying capacity&quot;, or that emphasise the &quot;thrill of driving&quot; or are marketed &quot;using the excitement of speed and the glamour of the (race)track&quot; However, other people have more specific definitions, such as &quot;must be a two-seater or a 2+2 seater&quot; or a car with two seats only.

In the United Kingdom, early recorded usage of the &quot;sports car&quot; was in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper in 1919. The first known use of the term in the United States was in 1928. Sports cars started to become popular during the 1920s. The term initially described two-seat roadsters (cars without a fixed roof), however, since the 1970s the term has also been used for cars with a fixed roof (which were previously considered grand tourers).

Attributing the definition of &#x27;sports car&#x27; to any particular model can be controversial or the subject of debate among enthusiasts. Authors and experts have often contributed their ideas to capture a definition. Insurance companies have also attempted to use mathematical formulae to categorise sports cars, often charging more for insurance due to the inherent risk of performance driving.

There is no fixed distinction between sports cars and other categories of performance cars, such as muscle cars and grand tourers, with some cars being members of several categories.

== Common characteristics ==
===Seating layout===
Traditionally, the most common layout for sports cars was a roadster (a two-seat car without a fixed roof). However, there are also several examples of early sports cars with four seats.

Sports cars are not usually intended to transport more than two adult occupants regularly, so most modern sports cars are generally two-seat or 2+2 layout (two smaller rear seats for children or occasional adult use). Larger cars with more spacious rear-seat accommodation are usually considered sports sedans rather than sports cars.

The 1993–1998 McLaren F1 is notable for using a three-seat layout, where the front row consists of a centrally-located driver&#x27;s seat.

=== Engine and drivetrain layout ===
The location of the engine and driven wheels significantly influence the handling characteristics of a car and are therefore crucial in the design of a sports car. Traditionally, most sports cars have used rear-wheel drive with the engine either located at the front (FR layout) or in the middle of the vehicle (MR layout). Examples of FR layout sports cars include the Caterham 7, Mazda MX-5, and the Dodge Viper. Examples of MR layout sports cars are the Ferrari 488, Ford GT, and Toyota MR2. To avoid a front-heavy weight distribution, many FR layout sports cars are designed so that the engine is located further back in the engine bay, as close to the firewall as possible.

Since the 1990s, all-wheel drive has become more common in sports cars. All-wheel drive offers better acceleration and favorable handling characteristics (especially in slippery conditions), but is often heavier and more mechanically complex than traditional layouts. Examples of all-wheel drive sports cars are the Lamborghini Huracan, Bugatti Veyron, and Nissan GT-R.

Rear engine layouts are not typical for sports cars, with the notable exception of the Porsche 911.

The front-wheel drive layout with the engine at the front (FF layout) is generally the most common for cars, but it is not as common among traditional sports cars. Nonetheless, the FF layout is used by sport compacts and hot hatches such as the Mazdaspeed3. Sports cars with an FF layout include the Fiat Barchetta, Saab Sonett, or Opel Tigra.
== Europe ==
=== 1895–1917: Brass Era of cars ===

The basis for the sports car is traced to the early 20th century touring cars and roadsters, and the term &#x27;sports car&#x27; would not be coined until after World War One.

A car considered to be &quot;a sports-car years ahead of its time&quot; is the 1903 Mercedes Simplex 60 hp, described at the time as a fast touring car and designed by Wilhelm Maybach and Paul Daimler. The Mercedes included pioneering features such as a pressed-steel chassis, a gated 4-speed transmission, pushrod-actuated overhead inlet valves, a honeycomb radiator, low-tension magneto ignition, a long wheelbase, a low center of mass and a very effective suspension system. The overall result was a &quot;safe and well-balanced machine&quot; with a higher performance than any other contemporary production car. At the 1903 Gordon Bennett Cup, a production Simplex 60 hp was entered only due to a specially-built 90 hp racing car being destroyed in a fire; the 60 hp famously went on to win the race.

The 1910 Austro-Daimler 27/80 is another early sports car which had success in motor racing. The 27/80 was designed by Ferdinand Porsche, who drove the car to victory in the 1910 Prince Henry Tour motor race. The Vauxhall and Austro-Daimler —like the Mercedes Simplex 60 hp— were production fast touring cars. The 1912 Hispano-Suiza Alfonso XIII is also considered one of the earliest sports cars, as it was a &quot;purpose built, high performance, two-seater production automobile&quot;. The model was named after King Alfonso XIII of Spain, a patron of the car&#x27;s chief designer and an enthusiast for the marque. Other early sports cars include the 1905 Isotta Fraschini Tipo D, the 1906 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost, the 1908 Delage, the 1910 Bugatti Type 13, and the 1912 DFP 12/15.

Early motor racing events included the 1903 Paris–Madrid race, the 1905–1907 Herkomer Trophy, the 1908-1911 Prince Henry Tour and the 1911–present Monte Carlo Rally. The Prince Henry Tours (which were similar to modern car rallies) were among the sporting events of the period, bringing renown to successful entrants. The Prince Henry Tours started the evolution of reasonably large and technically advanced production sports cars.

In England, the development of sporting cars was inhibited by the Motor Car Act 1903, which imposed a speed limit of on all public roads. This led to the 1907 opening of the Brooklands motor circuit, which inspired the development of performance cars such as the 1910 Vauxhall Prince Henry, 1910 Sunbeam 12/16, 1910 Talbot 25 hp, 1910 Straker-Squire 15 hp and 1913 Star 15.9 hp.

=== 1919–1929: Vintage Era cars ===

Following the halt in sports car production caused by World War I, Europe returned to manufacturing automobiles from around 1920. It was around this time that the term &#x27;Sports Car&#x27; began to appear in the motor catalogues, although the exact origin of the name is not known. The decade that followed became known as the vintage era and featured rapid technical advances over the preceding Brass Era cars. Engine performance benefited from the abandonment of &quot;tax horsepower&quot; (where vehicles were taxed based on bore and number of cylinders, rather than actual power output) and the introduction of leaded fuel, which increased power by allowing for higher compression ratios.

In the early 1920s, the cost to produce a racing car was not significantly higher than a road car, therefore several manufacturers used the design from the current year&#x27;s racing car for the next year&#x27;s sports car. For example, the 1921 Ballot 2LS based on the racing car that finished third at the 1921 French Grand Prix. The Benz 28/95PS was also a successful racing car, with victories including the 1921 Coppa Florio.
Another approach— such as that used by Morris Garages— was to convert touring cars into sports cars.

The first 24 Hours of Le Mans race for sports cars was held in 1923, although the two-seat sports cars only competed in the smallest class, with the majority of cars entered being four-seat fast touring cars. &quot;This race, together with the Tourist Trophy Series of Races, organised after the first World War by the R.A.C., appealed to the public imagination and offered to the manufacturers of the more sporting cars an excellent opportunity for boosting sales of their products.&quot; The classic Italian road races— the Targa Florio, and the Mille Miglia (first held in 1927)— also captured the public&#x27;s imagination.

By 1925, the higher profits available for four-seater cars resulted in the production of two-seat sports cars being limited to smaller manufacturers such as Aston-Martin (350 Astons built from 1921 to 1939) and Frazer-Nash (323 cars built from 1924 to 1939). Then by the late 1920s, the cost of producing racing cars (especially Grand Prix cars) escalated, causing more manufacturers to produce cars for the growing sports car market instead.

Significant manufacturers of sports cars in the late 1920s were AC Cars, Alfa Romeo, Alvis, Amilcar, Bignan and Samson, Chenard-Walcker, Delage, Hispano-Suiza, Hotchkiss, Mercedes-Benz and Nazzaro. Two cars from the Vintage Era that would influence sports cars for many years were the Austin Seven and MG M-type &quot;Midget&quot;. Successful sports cars from Bentley during this era were the Bentley 3 Litre (1921–1929) and the Bentley Speed Six (1928–1930), with the former famously described by Bugatti&#x27;s founder as &quot;the fastest lorry in the world&quot;.


=== 1930–1939: Pre-war Era cars ===

Between the Great Depression and the World War II the pre-war era was a period of decline in importance for sports car manufacturers, although the period was not devoid of advances, for example streamlining. Cheap, light-weight family sedans with independent front suspension— such as the BMW 303, Citroën Traction Avant and Fiat 508— offered similar handling and comfort to the more expensive sports cars. Powerful, reliable, and economical (although softly suspended) American saloons began to be imported to Europe in significant numbers. Sports car ownership was increased through models such as the Austin 7 and Wolseley Hornet six, however many of these sports cars did not offer any performance upgrades over the mass-produced cars upon which they were based.

The highest selling sports car company of the 1930s was Morris Garages, who produced &#x27;MG Midget&#x27; models of the M-Type, J-Type, P-Type and T-Type. The K3 version of the K-Type Magnette was a successful racing car, achieving success in the Mille Miglia, Tourist Trophy and 24 Hours of Le Mans.

The Bugatti Type 57 (1934-1940) was another significant sports car of the pre-war era and is now among the most valuable cars in the world. The T57 was successful in sports car races, including winning the 1937 24 Hours of Le Mans and 1939 24 Hours of Le Mans. Another successful Bugatti sports car was the Bugatti Type 55 (1932-1935), which was based on the Type 51 Grand Prix racing car.


=== 1939–1959: Growth following World War II ===
The decade following the Second World War saw an &quot;immense growth of interest in the sports car, but also the most important and diverse technical developments [and] very rapid and genuine improvement in the qualities of every modern production car; assisted by new design and manufacturing techniques a consistently higher level of handling properties has been achieved.&quot;

In Italy, a small but wealthy market segment allowed for the manufacture of a limited number of high-performance models directly allied to contemporary Grand Prix machines, such as the 1948 Ferrari 166 S. A new concept altogether was the modern &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; class from Italy, which was in effect unknown before the war: sustained high-speed motoring from relatively modest engine size and compact closed or &quot;berlinetta&quot; coachwork. The 1947 Maserati A6 1500 two-seat berlinetta was the first production model from Maserati.

In Germany, the motor industry was devastated by the war, but a small number of manufacturers returned it to prominence. In 1948, the Porsche 356 was released as the debut model from Porsche. The significance of the Porsche 356 and its successors was described in 1957 as &quot;future historians must see them as among the most important of mid-century production cars&quot;. The 1954 Mercedes-Benz 300 SL is another significant car from this era.

=== 1960–1979: Lightweight roadsters, mid-engined supercars ===
The 1961 Jaguar E-Type is an iconic sports car of the early 1960s, due to its attractive styling and claimed top speed of . The E-type was produced for 14 years and was initially powered by a six-cylinder engine, followed by a V12 engine for the final generation.

In 1962, the MG B introduced a new era of affordable lightweight four-cylinder roadsters. The MG B used a unibody construction and was produced until 1980. Other successful lightweight roadsters include the Triumph Spitfire (1962-1980) and the Alfa Romeo Spider (1966-1993). The Fiat X1/9 (1972-1989) was unusual for its use of a mid-engine design in an affordable roadster model. A late entrant to the affordable roadster market was the 1975 Triumph TR7, however by the late 1970s the demand for this style of car was in decline, resulting in production ceasing in 1982.

The original Lotus Elan (1962-1975) two-seat coupe and roadster models are an early commercial success for the philosophy of achieving performance through minimizing weight and has been rated as one of the top 10 sports cars of the 1960s. The Elan featured fibreglass bodies, a backbone chassis, and overhead camshaft engines.

A different style of roadster was the AC Cobra, released in 1962, which was fitted with V8 engines up to in size by Shelby.

The Porsche 911 was released in 1964 and has remained in production since. The 911 is notable for its use of the uncommon rear-engine design and the use of a flat-six engine. Another successful rear-engine sports car was the original Alpine A110 (1961-1977), which was a successful rally car during the Group 4 era.

In 1965, the BMW New Class Coupes were released, leading to the BMW 6 Series which remains in production to this day.

The Lamborghini Miura (1966) and Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale (1967) mid-engined high-performance cars are often cited as the first supercars. Other significant European models of the 1960s and 1970s which might be considered supercars today are the Ferrari 250 GTO (1962-1964), Ferrari 250 GT Lusso (1963-1964), Ferrari 275 GTB/4 (1966-1968), Maserati Ghibli (1967-1973), Ferrari Daytona (1968-1973), Dino 246 (1969-1974), De Tomaso Pantera (1971-1993), Ferrari 308 GTB (1975-1980) and BMW M1 (1978-1981).

In 1966, the Jensen FF became the first sports car to use all-wheel drive.

The Ford Capri is a 2+2 coupe that was produced from 1968 to 1986 and intended to be a smaller European equivalent of the Ford Mustang. A main rival to the Capri was Opel Manta, which was produced from 1970 to 1988.

The 1973-1978 Lancia Stratos was a mid-engined two-seat coupe that was powered by a Ferrari V6 engine. This was an unusual arrangement for a car used to compete in rallying, nonetheless it was very successful and won the World Rally Championship in 1974, 1975, and 1976.

The Lancia Montecarlo was produced from 1975 to 1981 and is a mid-engine two-seater, available as a coupé or a targa-top. It was sold as Lancia Scorpion in the USA. Its racing variant, Montecarlo Turbo, won the 1979 World Championship for Makes in its division and overall for 1980 World Championship for Makes and 1981 World Endurance Championship for Makes. Montecarlo also won the 1980 Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft and Giro d&#x27;Italia automobilistico marathon. The Montecarlo was a basis for the silhouette racing car, Lancia Rally 037.

In the 1970s, turbocharging began to be adopted by sports cars, such as the BMW 2002 Turbo in 1973, the first Porsche 911 Turbo in 1975, and the Saab 99 Turbo in 1978.

=== 1980–1999: Turbocharging and all-wheel drive emerge ===

Turbocharging became increasingly popular in the 1980s, from relatively affordable coupes such as the 1980–1986 Renault Fuego and 1992–1996 Rover 220 Coupé Turbo, to expensive supercars such as the 1984-1987 Ferrari 288 GTO and 1987-1992 Ferrari F40.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, several manufacturers developed supercars that competed for production car top speed records. These cars included the 1986–1993 Porsche 959, 1991–1995 Bugatti EB 110, 1992–1994 Jaguar XJ220 and 1993–98 McLaren F1.

The 1980-1995 Audi Quattro was a pioneering all-wheel drive sports car. The 1995 Porsche 911 Turbo (993) saw the 911 Turbo model switch to all-wheel drive, a drivetrain layout that the model uses to this day.

The BMW M3 was released in 1986 and has been produced for every generation since. The 1993-1996 Mercedes-Benz W124 E36 AMG was the mass-produced AMG model. Audi&#x27;s equivalent division, called &quot;RS&quot;, was launched in 1994 with the Audi RS 2 Avant.

Ford Europe withdrew from the sports car market at the end of 1986 when the Capri was discontinued after a production run of nearly two decades. There was no direct successor, as Ford was concentrating on higher-performance versions of its hatchback and saloon models at the time.

In 1989, a new generation of Lotus Elan roadster was released which used a front-wheel drive layout, a controversial choice for a &quot;purist&quot; sports car. The Elan sold poorly and was discontinued after three years. The 1996 Lotus Elise, a mid-engined, rear-wheel drive roadster, was much more successful and remained in production until 2021.

Roadsters enjoyed a resurgence in the mid-1990s, including the 1989-present Mazda MX-5, the 1995-2002 BMW Z3 (succeeded by the 2002-2016 BMW Z4), the 1995-2002 MG F, the 1996–present Porsche Boxster and the 1998–present Audi TT.

The Honda S2000 roadster was introduced in 1999 for the 2000 model year and was noted for its high-revving 4-cylinder engine and its exceptionally high specific output of 125 horsepower per litre.

=== 2000–present: Turbos become dominant, hybrids emerge ===

The 2000–2021 Lotus Exige was introduced as a coupe version of Elise. Similarly, Porsche Cayman (987) was introduced in 2006 as the coupe equivalent to the Porsche Boxster roadster. Lotus also expanded its model range with the 2009–2021 Lotus Evora, a larger four-seat coupe.

Audi&#x27;s first mid-engined supercar is the 2006–present Audi R8. Other sports cars of the 2000s were the 2005-2010 Alfa Romeo Brera/Spider, 2009-2015 Peugeot RCZ, and the 2008-2017 reintroduction of the Volkswagen Scirocco (a coupe based on the VW Golf platform).

Reflecting overall car industry trends, the mid-2010s saw naturally aspirated engines being replaced by turbocharged engines. Ferrari&#x27;s first regular production turbocharged engine was used in the 2014-2017 Ferrari California T, followed by the 2015-2019 Ferrari 488. Similarly, in 2016, the Porsche 911 (991.2) began to use turbocharging on all models and the Porsche 982 Cayman/Boxster downsized from a six-cylinder engine to a turbocharged four-cylinder engine.

Also in the 2010s, dual-clutch transmissions became more widespread, causing manual transmissions to decline in sales and no longer be offered on some models.

Hybrid-electric sports cars began to appear in the 2010s— notably the 2013-2016 LaFerrari, 2013-2015 McLaren P1, 2013-2015 Porsche 918 Spyder &quot;hypercars&quot;. The 2014–2020 BMW i8 was also an early plug-in hybrid sports car.

McLaren began permanent car manufacturing operations with the 2011-2014 McLaren 12C.

In 2013, the Jaguar F-Type saw the brand return to the two-seat sports car market, with the four-seat grand tourer Jaguar XK discontinued the following year.

The BMW 2 Series coupe and convertible were introduced in 2013 to sit below the larger BMW 4 Series models, with the new BMW M2 high-performance model introduced in 2015.

The 2013–present Alfa Romeo 4C two-seat coupe and roadster used a carbon-fibre body and became Alfa&#x27;s first mid-engine sports car since the 1967-1969 Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale.

Fiat had exited the roadster market with the end of Fiat Barchetta production in 2005. The company resumed production of roadsters in 2016 with the Fiat 124 Spider, which is based on the Mazda MX-5.

In 2017, Renault revived the Alpine brand for the 2017–present Alpine A110 mid-engine coupe.
== United States ==
During the 1910s and 1920s, American manufacturers of smaller sports cars included Apperson, Kissel, Marion, Midland, National, Overland, Stoddard-Dayton and Thomas; manufacturers of larger sports cars included Chadwick, Mercer, Stutz Motor Company, and Simplex.

Since the 1960s, American performance cars have often been designed as muscle cars rather than sports cars. However, several American two-seat sports cars have also been produced, such as the 1953–present Chevrolet Corvette, 1962-1967 Shelby Cobra, 1983-1988 Pontiac Fiero, 1991-2017 Dodge Viper, and 2005-2006 Ford GT.

== Asia ==

=== 1959–1968: Beginnings ===
The first Japanese sports car was the 1959-1960 Datsun 211, a two-seat roadster built on the chassis of a compact pickup truck and powered by a engine. Only 20 cars were built, and the 1963-1965 Datsun SP310— based on the chassis of a passenger sedan instead of a pickup truck— is often considered Datsun&#x27;s first mass-production sports car.

Honda&#x27;s first sports car was the 1963-1964 Honda S500, a two-seat roadster with independent suspension for all wheels and a DOHC engine. In 1965, Toyota joined the two-seat roadster market with the Toyota Sports 800.

Mazda is noted for its use of rotary engines, beginning in 1967 with the Mazda Cosmo. The Cosmo was a two-seat coupe with a rotary engine producing up to . Mazda continued to produce sports cars with rotary engines (sometimes turbocharged) until the Mazda RX-8 ended production in 2012.

The Toyota 2000GT, produced from 1967 to 1970, was an expensive two-seat coupe that greatly changed overseas perceptions of the Japanese automotive industry. The 2000GT demonstrated that Japan was capable of producing high-end sports cars to rival the traditional European brands. 
=== 1969–1977: Mass production begins ===
In 1969, Nissan introduced the Nissan Fairlady Z / Datsun 240Z two-seat coupe, powered by a six-cylinder engine and described as providing similar performance to the Jaguar E-Type at a more affordable price. The 240Z began the lineage of Nissan &quot;Z cars&quot; which continues through to today&#x27;s Nissan Z (RZ34). In 1974, Nissan expanded their coupe range with the Nissan Silvia 2+2 coupe, which was powered by a four-cylinder engine and produced until 2002.

Also in 1969, Mitsubishi&#x27;s first performance car was introduced, in the form of the Mitsubishi Colt 11-F Super Sports coupe. The 11-F Super Sports was followed by the 1970-1977 Mitsubishi Galant GTO and 1971-1975 Mitsubishi Galant FTO, both based on a platform shared with the Galant sedan.

Toyota&#x27;s mass-production 2+2 coupes of the 1970s consisted of the Celica, Supra, Corolla Levin, and Sprinter Trueno. The Celica was introduced in 1971 and remained in production until 2006. From 1979 to 1986, the Supra name was used for six-cylinder versions of the Celica, until the Supra moved to a separate platform from 1986 to 2002. The Corolla Levin / Sprinter Trueno were based on the Toyota Corolla hatchback platform and produced from 1972 to 2000.

The Nissan Skyline GT-R was initially produced as a sedan for two years before a coupe model was introduced in 1971. This first generation Skyline GT-R had rear-wheel drive, a six-cylinder engine, and was produced until 1972. 
=== 1978–1988: Front-wheel drive introduced ===
The Honda Prelude front-wheel drive 2+2 coupe was launched in 1978 and remained in production until 2001. The 1985-2006 Honda Integra was also a front-wheel drive 2+2 coupe produced by Honda. Other 2+2 models included the 1982-1989 Mitsubishi Starion (turbocharged and rear-wheel drive) and the 1985-1991 Subaru XT (available with a turbocharger and all-wheel drive). Subaru has produced few sports cars in its history, instead focusing on rally-influenced sedans/hatchbacks for their performance models, such as the Liberty RS and Impreza WRX/STi models.

In 1984, the Toyota MR2 two-seat coupe became Japan&#x27;s first production mid-engine car. The MR2 switched to a two-seat roadster body style for the final generation from 1999 to 2007.

The first Korean coupe model was the 1988 Hyundai Scoupe, which used front-wheel drive and was based on the Excel hatchback. The Scoupe was followed by 1996-2008 Hyundai Tiburon and 2011-2022 Hyundai Veloster.
=== 1989–2006: All-wheel drive, first supercars ===
In the 1990s, multiple Japanese automakers made flagship sports cars, such as the Toyota Supra, Nissan Skyline GT-R, Honda NSX, Mazda RX-7, and Mitsubishi 3000GT, which notably performed well against their European competition. These automakers had a well-documented gentlemen&#x27;s agreement to officially limit advertised power figures for these vehicles to a maximum of .

The Nissan Skyline GT-R was reintroduced in 1989-2002 (R32, R33, and R34 generations) which became famous for their use of turbocharging and all-wheel drive, which provided performance comparable with many more expensive sports cars.

The 1990-2005 Honda NSX is considered Japan&#x27;s first supercar. The NSX was praised for being more reliable and user-friendly than contemporary European supercars.

The Honda S2000 is an open top sports car that was manufactured from 1999 to 2009. The S2000 is named for its engine displacement of two liters, carrying on in the tradition of the S500, S600, and S800 roadsters of the 1960s. Its engine is notable for its high specific power output.

The Mitsubishi GTO coupe/convertible was introduced in 1990. The base models used front-wheel drive and a naturally aspirated V6 engine, however all-wheel drive and a turbocharged V6 engine were also available. To sit below the GTO in the model range, the Mitsubishi FTO front-wheel drive coupe was introduced in 1994. Both the GTO and FTO were discontinued in 2000.

Suzuki&#x27;s first sports car was the 1991-1998 Suzuki Cappuccino, a two-seat roadster kei car with rear-wheel drive and a turbocharged engine.

From 2003 to 2012 Mazda produced the Mazda RX-8, a rear-wheel drive quad coupé powered by a 1.3 L &quot;Renesis&quot; twin-rotor engine.
=== 2007–present: Declining popularity of coupes ===
Due to production constraints, lower demand, and environmental regulations, the viability of new Japanese sports cars began to decrease in the mid-2000s. The latest generation (R35) of the Nissan Skyline GT-R started production in 2007 as the Nissan GT-R. It was noteworthy for offering supercar performance with sports car practicality.

The Lexus LFA supercar was released by Lexus in 2010, a two-seat front-engine coupe powered by a V10 engine.

The Toyota 86 / Subaru BRZ is a 2+2 coupe that was introduced in 2012 and currently remains in production with a new model released for the 2022 model year. The 86/BRZ is a rare modern example of a relatively affordable rear-wheel drive sports car.

The 2016–2022 Honda NSX (2nd generation) supercar marked a change in approach for Honda, by using all-wheel drive, a hybrid drivetrain, turbocharging, and a dual-clutch transmission.

Toyota relaunched the Supra nameplate in 2019 after a 17-year hiatus for the Toyota GR Supra front-engine, rear-wheel-drive coupe. Nissan also released the new RZ34 generation of their Nissan Z in 2022.

<text>An iceberg is a piece of fresh water ice more than long that has broken off a glacier or an ice shelf and is floating freely in open water. Smaller chunks of floating glacially derived ice are called &quot;growlers&quot; or &quot;bergy bits&quot;. Much of an iceberg is below the water&#x27;s surface, which led to the expression &quot;&quot; to illustrate a small part of a larger unseen issue. Icebergs are considered a serious maritime hazard.

Icebergs vary considerably in size and shape. Icebergs that calve from glaciers in Greenland are often irregularly shaped while Antarctic ice shelves often produce large tabular (table top) icebergs. The largest iceberg in recent history, named B-15, was measured at nearly in 2000. The largest iceberg on record was an Antarctic tabular iceberg measuring sighted west of Scott Island, in the South Pacific Ocean, by the USS &quot;Glacier&quot; on November 12, 1956. This iceberg was larger than Belgium.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;iceberg&quot; is a partial loan translation from the Dutch word , literally meaning &quot;ice mountain&quot;, cognate to Danish , German , Low Saxon &quot;Iesbarg&quot; and Swedish &quot;&quot;.

==Overview==
Typically about one-tenth of the volume of an iceberg is above water, which follows from Archimedes&#x27;s Principle of buoyancy; the density of pure ice is about 920 kg/m3 (57 lb/cu ft), and that of seawater about . The contour of the underwater portion can be difficult to judge by looking at the portion above the surface. 


The largest icebergs recorded have been calved, or broken off, from the Ross Ice Shelf of Antarctica. Icebergs may reach a height of more than above the sea surface and have mass ranging from about 100,000 tonnes up to more than 10 million tonnes. Icebergs or pieces of floating ice smaller than 5 meters above the sea surface are classified as &quot;bergy bits&quot;; smaller than 1 meter—&quot;growlers&quot;. The largest known iceberg in the North Atlantic was above sea level, reported by the USCG icebreaker &quot;Eastwind&quot; in 1958, making it the height of a 55-story building. These icebergs originate from the glaciers of western Greenland and may have interior temperatures of .

=== Drift ===
A given iceberg&#x27;s trajectory through the ocean can be modelled by integrating the equation

: formula_1

where &quot;m&quot; is the iceberg mass, &quot;v&quot; the drift velocity, and the variables &quot;f&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, and &quot;F&quot; correspond to the Coriolis force, the vertical unit vector, and a given force. The subscripts a, w, r, s, and p correspond to the air drag, water drag, wave radiation force, sea ice drag, and the horizontal pressure gradient force.

Icebergs deteriorate through melting and fracturing, which changes the mass &quot;m&quot;, as well as the surface area, volume, and stability of the iceberg. Iceberg deterioration and drift, therefore, are interconnected ie. iceberg thermodynamics, and fracturing must be considered when modelling iceberg drift.

Winds and currents may move icebergs close to coastlines, where they can become frozen into pack ice (one form of sea ice), or drift into shallow waters, where they can come into contact with the seabed, a phenomenon called seabed gouging.

=== Mass loss ===
Icebergs lose mass due to melting, and calving. Melting can be due to solar radiation, or heat and salt transport from the ocean. Iceberg calving is generally enhanced by waves impacting the iceberg. 

Melting tends to be driven by the ocean, rather than solar radiation. Ocean driven melting is often modelled as

: formula_2

where formula_3 is the melt rate in m/day, formula_4 is the relative velocity between the iceberg and the ocean, formula_5 is the temperature difference between the ocean and the iceberg, and formula_6 is the length of the iceberg. formula_7 is a constant based on properties of the iceberg and the ocean and is approximately formula_8 in the polar ocean.

The influence of the shape of an iceberg and of the Coriolis force on iceberg melting rates has been demonstrated in laboratory experiments.

Wave erosion is more poorly constrained but can be estimated by

: formula_9

where formula_10 is the wave erosion rate in m/day, formula_11, formula_12 describes the sea state, formula_13 is the sea surface temperature, and formula_14 is the sea ice concentration.

=== Bubbles ===
Air trapped in snow forms bubbles as the snow is compressed to form firn and then glacial ice. Icebergs can contain up to 10% air bubbles by volume. These bubbles are released during melting, producing a fizzing sound that some may call &quot;Bergie Seltzer&quot;. This sound results when the water-ice interface reaches compressed air bubbles trapped in the ice. As each bubble bursts it makes a &quot;popping&quot; sound and the acoustic properties of these bubbles can be used to study iceberg melt.

=== Stability ===
An iceberg may flip, or capsize, as it melts and breaks apart, changing the center of gravity. Capsizing can occur shortly after calving when the iceberg is young and establishing balance. Icebergs are unpredictable and can capsize anytime and without warning. Large icebergs that break off from a glacier front and flip onto the glacier face can push the entire glacier backwards momentarily, producing &#x27;glacial earthquakes&#x27; that generate as much energy as an atomic bomb.

===Color===
Icebergs are generally white because they are covered in snow, but can be green, blue, yellow, black, striped, or even rainbow-colored. Seawater, algae and lack of air bubbles in the ice can create diverse colors. Sediment can create the dirty black coloration present in some icebergs.

===Shape===

In addition to size classification (Table 1), icebergs can be classified on the basis of their shapes. The two basic types of iceberg forms are &quot;tabular&quot; and &quot;non-tabular&quot;. Tabular icebergs have steep sides and a flat top, much like a plateau, with a length-to-height ratio of more than 5:1.

This type of iceberg, also known as an &quot;ice island&quot;, can be quite large, as in the case of Pobeda Ice Island. Antarctic icebergs formed by breaking off from an ice shelf, such as the Ross Ice Shelf or Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelf, are typically tabular. The largest icebergs in the world are formed this way.

Non-tabular icebergs have different shapes and include:

* &quot;Dome&quot;: An iceberg with a rounded top.
* &quot;Pinnacle&quot;: An iceberg with one or more spires.
* &quot;Wedge&quot;: An iceberg with a steep edge on one side and a slope on the opposite side.
* &quot;Dry-dock&quot;: An iceberg that has eroded to form a slot or channel.
* &quot;Blocky&quot;: An iceberg with steep, vertical sides and a flat top. It differs from tabular icebergs in that its aspect ratio, the ratio between its width and height, is small, more like that of a block than a flat sheet.

==Monitoring and control==

===History===
Prior to 1914 there was no system in place to track icebergs to guard ships against collisions despite fatal sinkings of ships by icebergs. In 1907, &quot;SS Kronprinz Wilhelm&quot;, a German liner, rammed an iceberg and suffered a crushed bow, but she was still able to complete her voyage. The advent of watertight compartmentalization in ship construction led designers to declare their ships &quot;unsinkable&quot;.

During the 1912 sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, the iceberg that sank the Titanic killed more than 1,500 of its estimated 2,224 passengers and crew, seriously damaging the &#x27;unsinkable&#x27; claim. For the remainder of the ice season of that year, the United States Navy patrolled the waters and monitored ice movements. In November 1913, the International Conference on the Safety of Life at Sea met in London to devise a more permanent system of observing icebergs. Within three months the participating maritime nations had formed the International Ice Patrol (IIP). The goal of the IIP was to collect data on meteorology and oceanography to measure currents, ice-flow, ocean temperature, and salinity levels. They monitored iceberg dangers near the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and provided the &quot;limits of all known ice&quot; in that vicinity to the maritime community. The IIP published their first records in 1921, which allowed for a year-by-year comparison of iceberg movement.

===Technological development===

Aerial surveillance of the seas in the early 1930s allowed for the development of charter systems that could accurately detail the ocean currents and iceberg locations. In 1945, experiments tested the effectiveness of radar in detecting icebergs. A decade later, oceanographic monitoring outposts were established for the purpose of collecting data; these outposts continue to serve in environmental study. A computer was first installed on a ship for the purpose of oceanographic monitoring in 1964, which allowed for a faster evaluation of data. By the 1970s, ice-breaking ships were equipped with automatic transmissions of satellite photographs of ice in Antarctica. Systems for optical satellites had been developed but were still limited by weather conditions. In the 1980s, drifting buoys were used in Antarctic waters for oceanographic and climate research. They are equipped with sensors that measure ocean temperature and currents.
Side looking airborne radar (SLAR) made it possible to acquire images regardless of weather conditions. On November 4, 1995, Canada launched RADARSAT-1. Developed by the Canadian Space Agency, it provides images of Earth for scientific and commercial purposes. This system was the first to use synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which sends microwave energy to the ocean surface and records the reflections to track icebergs. The European Space Agency launched ENVISAT (an observation satellite that orbits the Earth&#x27;s poles) on March 1, 2002. ENVISAT employs advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) technology, which can detect changes in surface height accurately. The Canadian Space Agency launched RADARSAT-2 in December 2007, which uses SAR and multi-polarization modes and follows the same orbit path as RADARSAT-1.

===Modern monitoring===

Iceberg concentrations and size distributions are monitored worldwide by the U.S. National Ice Center (NIC), established in 1995, which produces analyses and forecasts of Arctic, Antarctic, Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay ice conditions. More than 95% of the data used in its sea ice analyses are derived from the remote sensors on polar-orbiting satellites that survey these remote regions of the Earth.

The NIC is the only organization that names and tracks all Antarctic Icebergs. It assigns each iceberg larger than along at least one axis a name composed of a letter indicating its point of origin and a running number. The letters used are as follows:
:A – longitude 0° to 90° W (Bellingshausen Sea, Weddell Sea)
:B – longitude 90° W to 180° (Amundsen Sea, Eastern Ross Sea)
:C – longitude 90° E to 180° (Western Ross Sea, Wilkes Land)
:D – longitude 0° to 90° E (Amery Ice Shelf, Eastern Weddell Sea)

The Danish Meteorological Institute monitors iceberg populations around Greenland using data collected by the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) on the Sentinel-1 satellites.

=== Iceberg management ===
In Labrador and Newfoundland, iceberg management plans have been developed to protect offshore installations from impacts with icebergs.

=== Commercial use ===
The idea of towing large icebergs to other regions as a source of water has been raised since at least the 1950s, without having been put into practice. In 2017, a business from the UAE announced plans to tow an iceberg from Antarctica to the Middle East; in 2019 salvage engineer Nick Sloane announced a plan to move one to South Africa at an estimated cost of $200 million. In 2019, a German company, Polewater, announced plans to tow Antarctic icebergs to places like South Africa.

Companies have used iceberg water in products such as bottled water, fizzy ice cubes and alcoholic drinks. For example, Iceberg Beer by Quidi Vidi Brewing Company is made from icebergs found around St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. Although annual iceberg supply in Newfoundland and Labrador exceeds the total freshwater consumption of the United States, in 2016 the province introduced a tax on iceberg harvesting and imposed a limit on how much fresh water can be exported yearly.

== Oceanography and ecology ==
The freshwater injected into the ocean by melting icebergs can change the density of the seawater in the vicinity of the iceberg. Fresh melt water released at depth is lighter, and therefore more buoyant, than the surrounding seawater causing it to rise towards the surface. Icebergs can also act as floating breakwaters, impacting ocean waves.

Icebergs contain variable concentrations of nutrients and minerals that are released into the ocean during melting. Iceberg-derived nutrients, particularly the iron contained in sediments, can fuel blooms of phytoplankton. Samples collected from icebergs in Antarctica, Patagonia, Greenland, Svalbard, and Iceland, however, show that iron concentrations vary significantly, complicating efforts to generalize the impacts of icebergs on marine ecosystems.

==Recent large icebergs==
Iceberg B15 calved from the Ross Ice Shelf in 2000 and initially had an area of . It broke apart in November 2002. The largest remaining piece of it, Iceberg B-15A, with an area of , was still the largest iceberg on Earth until it ran aground and split into several pieces October 27, 2005, an event that was observed by seismographs both on the iceberg and across Antarctica. It has been hypothesized that this breakup may also have been abetted by ocean swell generated by an Alaskan storm 6 days earlier and away.

In June 2011, large fragments of the Petermann Ice Islands were observed off the Labrador coast.

== In culture ==

One of the most infamous icebergs in history is the iceberg that sank the &quot;Titanic&quot;. The catastrophe led to the establishment of an International Ice Patrol shortly after. Icebergs in both the northern and southern hemispheres have often been compared in size to multiples of the -area of Manhattan Island.

Artists have used icebergs as the subject matter for their paintings. Frederic Edwin Church, &quot;The Icebergs&quot;, 1861 was painted from sketches Church completed on a boat trip off Newfoundland and Labrador. Caspar David Friedrich, &quot;The Sea of Ice,&quot; 1823–1824 is a polar landscape with an iceberg and ship wreck depicting the dangers of such conditions&quot;.&quot; William Bradford created detailed paintings of sailing ships set in arctic coasts and was fascinated by icebergs. Albert Bierstadt made studies on arctic trips aboard steamships in 1883 and 1884 that were the basis of his paintings of arctic scenes with colossal icebergs made in the studio.

American poet, Lydia Sigourney, wrote the poem &quot;Icebergs&quot;. While on a return journey from Europe in 1841, her steamship encountered a field of icebergs overnight, during an Aurora Borealis. The ship made it through unscathed to the next morning, when the sun rose and &quot;touched the crowns, Of all those arctic kings.&quot;

<doc id="146236" wikidata="Q320588" url="?curid=146236" title="Close Encounters of the Third Kind">
<text>Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a 1977 American science fiction drama film written and directed by Steven Spielberg, starring Richard Dreyfuss, Melinda Dillon, Teri Garr, Bob Balaban, Cary Guffey, and François Truffaut. The film depicts the story of Roy Neary, an everyday blue-collar worker in Indiana, whose life changes after an encounter with an unidentified flying object, and Jillian, a single mother whose three-year-old son was also abducted by a UFO.

&quot;Close Encounters&quot; was a long-cherished project for Spielberg. In late 1973, he developed a deal with Columbia Pictures for a science-fiction film. Though Spielberg received sole credit for the script, he was assisted by Paul Schrader, John Hill, David Giler, Hal Barwood, Matthew Robbins, and Jerry Belson, all of whom contributed to the screenplay in varying degrees. The title is derived from Ufologist J. Allen Hynek&#x27;s classification of close encounters with extraterrestrials, in which the third kind denotes human observations of extraterrestrials or &quot;animate beings&quot;. Douglas Trumbull served as the visual effects supervisor, while Carlo Rambaldi designed the extraterrestrials.

Made on a production budget of , &quot;Close Encounters&quot; was released in a limited number of cities on November 16 and 23, 1977, and expanded into wide release the following month. It was a critical and financial success, eventually grossing over worldwide. It received numerous awards and nominations at the 50th Academy Awards, 32nd British Academy Film Awards, the 35th Golden Globe Awards and the 5th Saturn Awards, and has been widely acclaimed by the American Film Institute.

In December 2007, it was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. A &quot;Special Edition&quot; was released theatrically in 1980. Spielberg agreed to create this edition to add more scenes that they had been unable to include in the original release, with the studio demanding a controversial scene depicting the interior of the extraterrestrial mothership. Spielberg&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the altered ending scene led to a third version, the &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; on VHS and LaserDisc in 1998 (and later DVD and Blu-ray). It is the longest version, combining Spielberg&#x27;s favorite elements from both previous editions but removing the scenes inside the mothership. The film was later remastered in 4K and was then re-released in theaters in 2017 for its 40th anniversary.

==Plot==
In 1977, French scientist Claude Lacombe, along with interpreter and cartographer David Laughlin, examine Flight 19—a group of United States Navy aircraft that vanished over the Bermuda Triangle in 1945—now found immaculate and abandoned in the Sonoran Desert. They later learn that the has similarly been found abandoned in the middle of the Gobi Desert. Meanwhile, near Indianapolis, two airplanes narrowly avoid a mid-air collision with an unidentified flying object (UFO).

At a rural home outside Muncie, Indiana, three-year-old Barry Guiler wakes to find his toys operating on their own and the fridge ransacked. He follows a trail outside before his mother, Jillian, catches him. Widespread power outages occur throughout the area, forcing electric utility lineman Roy Neary to investigate. En route, Roy experiences a close encounter with a UFO, and when it flies over his truck, it lightly burns the side of his face with its lights. The UFO takes off with three others in the sky, as Roy and police officers unsuccessfully pursue them by road.

Roy becomes fascinated with the UFOs and obsessed with a subliminal image of a mountainous shape, repeatedly making models of it. His increasingly erratic and eccentric behavior worries his wife Ronnie and their three children, and ostracizes him from his friends and neighbors. Ronnie eventually leaves with the children after Roy brings dirt, bricks, and other debris into their home to sculpt a large scale replica of the mountain. Jillian also begins compulsively sketching the unique mountain in her mind. Soon after, she is terrorized in her home by a UFO which descends from the clouds. She fights off aggressive attempts by unseen beings to enter the home, but in the chaos, Barry is abducted.

Lacombe, Laughlin, and a group of United Nations experts continue to investigate increasing UFO activity and strange, related occurrences. Witnesses in Dharamsala, Northern India report that the UFOs make distinctive sounds: a five-tone musical phrase in a pentatonic scale. Scientists broadcast the phrase to outer space, but receive only a seemingly meaningless repeating series of numbers in response. Laughlin eventually recognizes it as a set of geographical coordinates, which point to Devils Tower near Moorcroft, Wyoming. 

The US Army evacuates the area around Devils Tower, planting false reports in the media that a train wreck has spilled a toxic nerve gas, while actually preparing a secret landing site for the UFOs. Seeing the mountain on the news, Roy and Jillian recognize it as the one they have been visualizing. Despite the evacuation order, they, along with others who have been experiencing the visions, set out for Devils Tower, but are intercepted by the Army. Lacombe interviews Roy, who is unable to explain his compulsion to reach the mountain beyond seeking answers. While the others are escorted away, Roy and Jillian escape and eventually reach the mountain site just as UFOs appear in the night sky. 

The specialists there begin to communicate with the UFOs—which gradually appear by the dozens—by using light and sound on a large electrical billboard. An enormous mothership eventually arrives and seemingly conveys to the researchers a tonal means of communication before landing. A hatch opens, from which various humans and animals are released, having not aged since they were taken, including World War II pilots, &quot;Cotopaxi&quot; sailors, and Barry, who reunites with Jillian. Seeing Roy, Lacombe suggests preparing him for inclusion in the government&#x27;s select group of potential visitors to the mothership.

The extraterrestrials finally emerge from the mothership and select Roy to join their travels. As Roy enters the mothership, one of the extraterrestrials pauses for a few moments with the humans. Lacombe uses Curwen hand signs that correspond to the five-note tonal phrase. The extraterrestrial responds in kind, smiles, and returns to its ship, which takes to the sky.

==Cast==
* Richard Dreyfuss as Roy Neary, an electrical lineman in Indiana who encounters and forms an obsession with unidentified flying objects. Steve McQueen was Spielberg&#x27;s first choice. Although McQueen was impressed with the script, he said that he was not right for the role as he was unable to cry on cue. James Caan, Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino, and Gene Hackman also turned down the part. Robert De Niro was also considered. Jack Nicholson declined because of scheduling conflicts. Spielberg explained that when filming &quot;Jaws&quot;, &quot;Dreyfuss talked me into casting him. He listened to about 155 days&#x27; worth of &quot;Close Encounters&quot;. He even contributed ideas.&quot; Dreyfuss reflected, &quot;I launched myself into a campaign to get the part. I would walk by Steve&#x27;s office and say stuff like &#x27;Al Pacino has no sense of humor&#x27; or &#x27;Jack Nicholson is too crazy&#x27;. I eventually convinced him to cast me.&quot;
* François Truffaut as Claude Lacombe, a French government scientist in charge of UFO-related activities in the United States. The UFO expert Jacques Vallée served as the real-life model for Lacombe. Gérard Depardieu, Philippe Noiret, Jean-Louis Trintignant, and Lino Ventura were considered for the role. Internationally renowned as a film director, this is Truffaut&#x27;s only acting role in a film he did not direct, and his only role in an English-language film. During filming, Truffaut used his free time to write the script for &quot;The Man Who Loved Women&quot;. He also worked on the novel &quot;The Actor&quot;, which he abandoned.
* Teri Garr as Ronnie Neary, Roy&#x27;s wife. Meryl Streep and Amy Irving also auditioned for the role.
* Melinda Dillon as Jillian Guiler. Teri Garr wanted to portray Jillian, but was cast as Ronnie. Hal Ashby, who worked with Dillon on &quot;Bound for Glory&quot; (1976), suggested her for the part to Spielberg. Dillon was cast three days before filming began.
* Bob Balaban as David Laughlin, Lacombe&#x27;s assistant and English-French interpreter
* J. Patrick McNamara as Project Leader
* Warren Kemmerling as Major &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Walsh
* Roberts Blossom as Farmer
* Philip Dodds as Jean Claude
* Cary Guffey as Barry Guiler, Jillian&#x27;s son. Spielberg conducted a series of method acting techniques to help Guffey, who was cast when he was just three years old.
* Lance Henriksen as Robert
* Merrill Connally as Team Leader
* George DiCenzo as Major Benchley
* Gene Dynarski as Ike
* Josef Sommer as Larry Butler
* Carl Weathers as Military Police
* David Abraham Cheulkar as English-Hindi interpreter

==Production==
===Development===
The film&#x27;s inspiration arose in director Steven Spielberg&#x27;s childhood, when he and his father watched a meteor shower in New Jersey. At age 18, Spielberg completed the full-length science fiction film &quot;Firelight&quot;. Many scenes from &quot;Firelight&quot; were incorporated in &quot;Close Encounters&quot; on a shot-for-shot basis. In 1970, he wrote the short story &quot;Experiences&quot; about a lovers&#x27; lane in a Midwestern farming community and the &quot;light show&quot; a group of teenagers see in the night sky. In late 1973, after completing work on &quot;The Sugarland Express&quot;, Spielberg developed a deal with Columbia Pictures for a science-fiction film. 20th Century Fox had previously turned down the offer. Julia and Michael Phillips signed on as producers.

Spielberg first considered doing a documentary or low-budget feature film about people who believed in UFOs. He decided &quot;a film that depended on state-of-the-art technology couldn&#x27;t be made for $2.5 million.&quot; Borrowing a phrase from the ending of &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot;, he retitled the film &quot;Watch the Skies&quot;, rewriting the premise concerning Project Blue Book and pitching the concept to Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz. Katz remembered, &quot;It had flying saucers from outer space landing on Robertson Boulevard [in West Hollywood, California]. I go, Steve, that&#x27;s the worst idea I ever heard.&quot; Spielberg brought Paul Schrader to write the script in December 1973 with principal photography to begin in late 1974. To discuss the script, Spielberg visited the home where Schrader lived with his brother Leonard. However, Spielberg started work on &quot;Jaws&quot; in 1974, delaying &quot;Watch the Skies&quot;.

With the financial and critical success of &quot;Jaws&quot;, Spielberg was able to negotiate a high degree of creative control from Columbia, including the right to make the film any way he wanted. Schrader submitted his script, which Spielberg called &quot;one of the most embarrassing screenplays ever professionally turned in to a major film studio or director&quot; and &quot;a terribly guilt-ridden story not about UFOs at all&quot;. Titled &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, the script&#x27;s protagonist was a 45-year-old Air Force officer named Paul Van Owen who worked with Project Blue Book. &quot;[His] job for the government is to ridicule and debunk flying saucers.&quot; Schrader continued: &quot;One day he has an encounter. He goes to the government, threatening to blow the lid off to the public. Instead, he and the government spend 15 years trying to make contact.&quot;

Spielberg and Schrader experienced creative differences, hiring John Hill to rewrite. At one point, the main character was a police officer. Spielberg &quot;[found] it hard to identify with men in uniform. I wanted to have Mr. Everyday Regular Fella.&quot; Spielberg rejected the Schrader/Hill script during post-production on &quot;Jaws&quot;, reflecting that &quot;they wanted to make it like a James Bond adventure&quot;.

David Giler performed a rewrite; Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins, friends of Spielberg, suggested the plot device of a kidnapped child. Spielberg then began to write the script. The song &quot;When You Wish upon a Star&quot; from &quot;Pinocchio&quot; influenced Spielberg&#x27;s writing style. &quot;I hung my story on the mood the song created, the way it affected me personally.&quot; During pre-production, the title was changed from &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; to &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;.

J. Allen Hynek, who worked with the United States Air Force on Project Blue Book, was hired as a scientific consultant. Hynek said that &quot;even though the film is fiction, it&#x27;s based for the most part on the known facts of the UFO mystery, and it certainly catches the flavor of the phenomenon. Spielberg was under enormous pressure to make another blockbuster after &quot;Jaws&quot;, but he decided to make a UFO film. He put his career on the line.&quot; USAF and NASA declined to cooperate on the film. NASA reportedly sent a twenty-page letter to Spielberg, telling him that releasing the film was dangerous. In an interview, he said: &quot;I really found my faith when I heard that the Government was opposed to the film. If NASA took the time to write me a 20-page letter, then I knew there must be something happening.&quot;

Early in pre-production, Spielberg hired film title designer Dan Perri to design a logotype. Perri, who had previously worked on &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973) and &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976), produced a logotype in Handel Gothic typeface, with only a script to work from. Delighted with the result, Spielberg applied the logo to all production stationery and crew shirts. Unusual in filmmaking, Spielberg carried enough influence to maintain creative control over the film&#x27;s entire branding and asked Perri to design the advertising campaign and title sequence based on his logo.

Perri later designed titles for many other major Hollywood pictures, including &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), &quot;Raging Bull&quot; (1980), and &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980).

===Filming===

Principal photography began on May 16, 1976, though an Associated Press report in August 1975 had suggested filming would start in late 1975. Spielberg did not want to do any location shooting because of his negative experience on &quot;Jaws&quot; and wanted to shoot &quot;Close Encounters&quot; entirely on sound stages, but eventually dropped the idea.

Filming took place in Burbank, California; Devils Tower National Monument in Wyoming; two abandoned World War II airship hangars at the former Brookley Air Force Base in Mobile, Alabama; and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad depot in Bay Minette, Alabama. The home where Barry is abducted is located outside the town of Fairhope, Alabama. Roy Neary&#x27;s home is on Carlisle Drive East in Mobile. The UFOs fly through the former toll booth at the Vincent Thomas Bridge, San Pedro, California. The Sonora Desert sequence was photographed at the Dumont Dunes, California, and the Dharmsala-India exteriors were filmed at the small village of Hal near Khalapur, outside Mumbai, India. The hangars in Alabama were six times larger than the biggest sound stage in the world. Various technical and budgetary problems occurred during filming. Spielberg called the production of &quot;Close Encounters&quot; &quot;twice as bad and twice as expensive [as &quot;Jaws&quot;]&quot;.
Matters worsened when Columbia Pictures experienced financial difficulties. In his original 1973 pitch to Columbia, Spielberg claimed production would cost $2.7 million, although he revealed to producer Julia Philips that he knew the budget would have to be much higher; the final budget came to $19.4 million. Columbia studio executive John Veich remembered, &quot;If we knew it was going to cost that much, we wouldn&#x27;t have greenlighted it because we didn&#x27;t have the money.&quot; Spielberg hired Joe Alves, his collaborator on &quot;Jaws&quot;, as production designer. In addition, the 1976 Atlantic hurricane season brought tropical storms to Alabama. A large portion of the sound stage in Alabama was damaged because of a lightning strike. Columbia raised $7 million from three sources: Time Inc., EMI, and German tax shelters.

Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond said that, during shooting, Spielberg got more ideas by watching films every night, which in turn extended the production schedule because he was continually adding new scenes. Zsigmond previously turned down the chance to work on &quot;Jaws&quot;. In her 1991 book &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again&quot;, producer Julia Phillips wrote highly profane remarks about Spielberg, Zsigmond, and Truffaut, because she was fired during post-production due to a cocaine addiction. Phillips blamed it on Spielberg being a perfectionist.

===Visual effects===

Douglas Trumbull was the visual effects supervisor, and Carlo Rambaldi designed the extraterrestrials. Trumbull joked that the visual effects budget of $3.3 million could have been used to produce an additional film. His work helped lead to advances in motion control photography. The mothership was designed by Ralph McQuarrie and built by Greg Jein. The look of the ship was inspired by an oil refinery Spielberg saw at night in India. Instead of the metallic hardware look of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the emphasis was on luminescence of the UFOs. One of the UFO models was an oxygen mask with lights attached to it, used because of its irregular shape. 

As a subtle in-joke, Dennis Muren (who had just finished working on &quot;Star Wars&quot;) put a small R2-D2 model onto the underside of the mothership and a pea-sized TIE fighter to the end of one of the structures extending from the mothership. Model makers also included a mailbox, great-white shark, Volkswagen bus, and a small graveyard. The model also included alien figures moving in the windows of the miniature, though were not very visible in the final film. The mothership model is on permanent display steps away from the space shuttle orbiter Discovery in the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Air and Space Museum Udvar-Hazy Annex at Washington Dulles Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.

&quot;Close Encounters&quot; was filmed anamorphically and the visual effects sequences were shot on 70 mm film, which has greater resolution than the 35 mm film used for the rest of the production, so that when the miniature effects were combined with full-sized elements through an optical printer, the effects footage would still appear clear and sharp though having lost one generation&#x27;s worth of visual fidelity. A test reel using computer-generated imagery was created for the UFOs, but Spielberg found it would be too expensive and ineffective because CGI was in its infancy in the mid-1970s.

The small extraterrestrials in the final scenes were played by fifty local six-year-old girls in Mobile, Alabama. That decision was requested by Spielberg because &quot;girls move more gracefully than boys&quot;. Puppetry was attempted for the extraterrestrials, but the idea failed. However, Rambaldi successfully used puppetry to depict two of the extraterrestrials, starting with a marionette (for the tall extraterrestrial that is the first emerging from the mothership in what was originally a test shot) and an articulated puppet for the extraterrestrial that communicates via hand signals near the end of the film.

===Post-production===
&quot;Close Encounters&quot; is the first collaboration between film editor Michael Kahn and Spielberg. Their working relationship has continued for the rest of Spielberg&#x27;s films. Spielberg said that no film he has ever made since has been as hard to edit as the last 25 minutes of &quot;Close Encounters&quot; and that he and Kahn went through thousands of feet of film to find the right shots for the end sequence. When Kahn and Spielberg completed the first cut of the film, Spielberg was dissatisfied because &quot;there wasn&#x27;t enough wow-ness&quot;. Pick-ups were commissioned but cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond could not participate due to other commitments. John A. Alonzo, László Kovács, and Douglas Slocombe worked on the pick-ups. Lacombe was originally intended to find Flight 19 hidden in the Amazon rainforest, but the idea was changed to the Sonoran Desert. Spielberg also took 7.5 minutes out from the preview.

==Music==
The film score was composed, conducted, and produced by John Williams, who had previously worked on Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Jaws&quot;. Williams included the ominous two note phrase of the Jaws theme delivered by the mothership.

Williams wrote more than 300 examples of the iconic five-tone motif, to be used by scientists to communicate with the visiting spaceship as a mathematical language, before Spielberg chose the one incorporated into the film&#x27;s signature theme. Williams decided on five notes because &quot;it has to be somewhere between a fragment ... which is four notes, and a song ... which is seven notes, so he decided, mathematically, it would be five notes&quot;

Spielberg called Williams&#x27;s work &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star meets science fiction&quot;. Incidentally, Williams briefly included the signature melody into the score at Spielberg&#x27;s behest, just before Roy Neary turns to board the mothership. The synthesizer playing the five notes is an ARP 2500. Vice President of Engineering at ARP Instruments, Phillip Dodds, was sent to install the unit on the film set and was subsequently cast as Jean Claude, the musician who plays the sequence on the huge synthesizer in an attempt to communicate with the extraterrestrial mothership.

Spielberg initially included Cliff Edwards&#x27;s original &quot;When You Wish upon a Star&quot; from &quot;Pinocchio&quot; in the closing credits, but after a Dallas preview where several members of the audience audibly snickered at the inclusion, the song was dropped and replaced with Williams&#x27;s orchestral version. Phrases from &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; are included in the final sequence in the director&#x27;s cut and in the special edition of the end titles on the 1998 &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; of the soundtrack.

The score was recorded at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. Williams was nominated for two Academy Awards in 1978, one for his score to &quot;Star Wars&quot; and one for his score to &quot;Close Encounters&quot;. He won for &quot;Star Wars&quot;, though he later won two Grammy Awards in 1979 for his &quot;Close Encounters&quot; score (one for Best Original Film Score and one for Best Instrumental Composition for &quot;Theme from Close Encounters&quot;).

==Themes==
Film critic Charlene Engel observed:&quot;Close Encounters&quot; suggests that humankind has reached the point where it is ready to enter the community of the cosmos. While it is a computer which makes the final musical conversation with the extraterrestrial guests possible, the characteristics bringing Neary to make his way to Devils Tower have little to do with technical expertise or computer literacy. These are virtues taught in schools that will be evolved in the 21st century. The film also evokes typical science fiction archetypes and motifs. The film portrays new technologies as a natural and expected outcome of human development and indication of health and growth.

Other critics found a variety of Judeo-Christian analogies. Devils Tower parallels Mount Sinai, the extraterrestrials as God, and Roy Neary as Moses. Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; is on television at the Neary household. Some found close relations between Elijah and Roy; Elijah was taken into a &quot;chariot of fire&quot;, akin to Roy boarding the UFO. Climbing Devils Tower behind the faltering Jillian, Roy exhorts Jillian to keep moving and not to look back, a contrast to Lot&#x27;s wife, who looked back at Sodom and turned into a pillar of salt. Spielberg explained, &quot;I wanted to make &quot;Close Encounters&quot; a very accessible story about the everyday individual who has a sighting that overturns his life, and throws it into complete upheaval as he starts to become more and more obsessed with this experience.&quot;

Roy&#x27;s wife Ronnie attempts to hide the sunburn caused by Roy&#x27;s exposure to the UFOs and wants him to forget his encounter with them. She is embarrassed and bewildered by what has happened to him and desperately wants her ordinary life back. The expression of his lost life is seen when he is sculpting a huge model of Devils Tower in his living room, with his family deserting him. Roy&#x27;s obsession with an idea implanted by an extraterrestrial intelligence, his construction of the model, and his gradual loss of contact with his wife, mimic the events in the short story &quot;Dulcie and Decorum&quot; (1955) by Damon Knight.

&quot;Close Encounters&quot; studies the form of &quot;youth spiritual yearning&quot;. Barry Guiler, the unfearing child who refers to the UFOs and their paraphernalia as &quot;toys&quot; (although that was unscripted, with the child being drawn to smile by being shown toys offstage), serves as a motif for childlike innocence and openness in the face of the unknown. Spielberg also compared the theme of communication as highlighting that of tolerance: &quot;If we can talk to extraterrestrials in &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, why not with the Reds in the Cold War?&quot; Sleeping is the final obstacle to overcome in the ascent of Devils Tower. Roy, Jillian, and a third invitee, Larry Butler, climb the mountain pursued by government helicopters spraying sleeping gas. Larry stops to rest, is gassed, and falls into a deep sleep.

In his interview with Spielberg on &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;, James Lipton suggested &quot;Close Encounters&quot; has another, more personal theme for Spielberg: &quot;Your father was a computer engineer; your mother was a concert pianist, and when the spaceship lands, they make music together on the computer&quot;, suggesting that Roy Neary&#x27;s boarding the spaceship represents Spielberg&#x27;s wish to be reunited with his parents. The director had not consciously intended this aspect. In a 2005 interview, Spielberg stated that he made &quot;Close Encounters&quot; when he did not have children, and if he were making it today, he would never have had Roy leave his family and board the mothership.

Communication and language issues constitute additional themes as noted by Andrew Johnston in &quot;Time Out New York&quot;: &quot;Throughout the film, there are many scenes that anticipate themes Spielberg would explore in subsequent projects, but his execution of these ideas here is usually more interesting and subtle. In &quot;Amistad&quot;, for example, he devotes much time to illustrating the language barrier separating Africans from both their captors and their potential saviors. It&#x27;s an essential plot point, but it&#x27;s so belabored that the story gets bogged down. In &quot;CE3K&quot;, the language problem is illustrated concisely by a quick scene in which an interpreter translates Spanish into English for Laughlin so he can turn around and translate it into French for Lacombe. Since Spielberg doesn&#x27;t ram the language problem down our throats, the extraterrestrials&#x27; solution—using music to communicate with humanity—seems more elegant and natural.&quot;

==Release and reception==
===Box office===
The film was to be released in mid-1977 but was delayed to November because of the various production problems.

&quot;Close Encounters&quot; premiered at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on November 16, 1977, and continued there and at the Cinerama Dome in Los Angeles, grossing $1,077,000. Its national release was December 14, in 270 theaters and grossing $10,115,000 in one week with a per-screen average of $37,460. On December 21, 301 more theaters were added. By the end of the second week of national release it had grossed $24,695,317.

It made a record $3,026,558 on December 26, 1977, and set a one-week record of $17,393,654 from December 26 to January 1. The film opened internationally on February 24, 1978, and grossed $27 million by the end of March from 19 countries. &quot;Close Encounters&quot; received mostly positive reviews and became a certified box office success, grossing $116.39 million in the United States and Canada, and $171.7 million in foreign countries, for $288 million worldwide.

It was the most successful Columbia Pictures film at that time.

Released in conjunction with &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; was a novelization of the film, credited solely to Steven Spielberg but largely ghostwritten by Leslie Waller. Spielberg later explained to &quot;Starlog&quot; magazine,

===Critical reception===
Jonathan Rosenbaum refers to the film as &quot;the best expression of Spielberg&#x27;s benign, dreamy-eyed vision&quot;. A.D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; magazine gave a positive review but wrote that &quot;Close Encounters&quot; &quot;lacks the warmth and humanity&quot; of George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Murphy found most of the film slow-paced, but praised the climax. On Sneak Previews, Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert highly recommended the film. Siskel praised the message of not being &quot;afraid of the unknown&quot;, said Dreyfuss was &quot;perfectly cast&quot;, and described the ending as &quot;a wonderful scene, combining fantasy, adventure and mystery&quot;. However, he mentioned that the story got &quot;bogged down&quot; by a subplot in the middle. Ebert said &quot;the last 30 minutes are among the most marvelous things I&#x27;ve ever seen on the screen&quot; and that the film was &quot;like a kid&#x27;s picture...in its innocence&quot;. Pauline Kael similarly called it &quot;a kid&#x27;s film in the best sense&quot;. Kael wrote that &quot;Spielberg is the son of an electrical-engineer, sci-fi-addict father and a classical-pianist mother, and in the climax of the film he does justice to both. Under the French scientist’s direction, the earthlings are ready with a console, and they greet the great craft with an oboe solo variation on the five-note theme; the craft answers in deep, tuba tones. The dialogue becomes blissfully garrulous. And with light flooding out from the windows of this omniscient airship—it’s like New York’s skyscrapers all lighted up on a summer night—there is a conversational duet: the music of the spheres. This is one of the peerless moments in movie history—spiritually reassuring, magical, and funny at the same time. Very few movies have ever hit upon this combination of fantasy and amusement—&quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, perhaps, in a plainer, down-home way.&quot; Jean Renoir compared Spielberg&#x27;s storytelling to Jules Verne and Georges Méliès. Ray Bradbury declared it the greatest science fiction film ever made. David Thomson wrote that &quot;&quot;Close Encounters&quot; had a flawless wonder, such that it might be the first film ever made&quot; calling it &quot;a tribute to the richness of human imagination&quot; and &quot;as close to a mystical experience as a major film has come, but it&#x27;s the mysticism of common sense... The movie could have been naive and sentimental—it was inspired by Disney—but Spielberg never relinquishes his practicality and his eye for everyday detail.&quot;

===Reissues and home media===

On the final cut privilege, Spielberg was dissatisfied with the film. Columbia Pictures was experiencing financial problems, and depending on this film to save their company. He explained, &quot;I wanted to have another six months to finish off this film, and release it in summer 1978. They told me they needed this film out immediately. Anyway, &quot;Close Encounters&quot; was a huge financial success and I told them I wanted to make my own director&#x27;s cut. They agreed on the condition that I show the inside of the mothership so they could have something to hang a [reissue marketing] campaign on. I never should have shown the inside of the mothership.&quot;

In 1979, Columbia gave Spielberg $1.5 million to produce what became the &quot;Special Edition&quot;. Spielberg added seven minutes of new and previously discarded footage, but also deleted or shortened various existing scenes by ten minutes, so that its 132-minute runtime is 3 minutes shorter than the original release. The &quot;Special Edition&quot; features several new character development scenes, the discovery of the SS &quot;Cotopaxi&quot; in the Gobi Desert, and a view of the inside of the mothership. &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind: The Special Edition&quot; was released on August 3, 1980, making a further $15.7 million, accumulating a final $303.7 million box office gross. Roger Ebert &quot;thought the original film was an astonishing achievement, capturing the feeling of awe and wonder we have when considering the likelihood of life beyond the Earth. ... This new version ... is, quite simply, a better film ... Why didn&#x27;t Spielberg make it this good the first time?&quot;

The 1980 &quot;Special Edition&quot; was the only version officially available for many years on VHS. It was RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video&#x27;s biggest selling title with sales of 60,000 in its first three years of release in the United States. Then, in 1990, The Criterion Collection offered two versions for LaserDisc, one a variant of the original 1977 edition (with subtle edits made by Spielberg which became the syndicated television version), the other the &quot;Special Edition&quot; (programmed by the viewer using the LaserDisc player&#x27;s remote features that predate the seamless branching of DVDs). This triple-disc LaserDisc set also includes an interactive &quot;Making Close Encounters&quot; documentary featuring interviews with Spielberg and other cast and crew involved with the film, and stills and script excerpts. In 1993, the &quot;Special Edition&quot; was released on VHS and LaserDisc with no further release for 14 years.

Vincent Misiano reviewed &quot;Close Encounters: The Special Edition&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #5 and commented that &quot;Artists in other media have always had the luxury of returning to a piece, reworking and refining it. For various reasons, money first among them, this opportunity has rarely been afforded to filmmakers. Steven Spielberg has been given the chance and used it well.&quot;

On May 12, 1998, Spielberg recut &quot;Close Encounters&quot; again for the &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, released as simply the &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; on VHS. This version is a re-edit of the original 1977 release with some elements of the 1980 &quot;Special Edition&quot;, but omits the mothership interior scenes as Spielberg said they should have remained a mystery. The director&#x27;s cut is the longest release of the film at 137 minutes, two minutes longer than the theatrical version and five minutes longer than the &quot;Special Edition&quot;. A LaserDisc release of the &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;, on July 14, 1998, includes a new 101-minute documentary, &quot;The Making of Close Encounters&quot;, which was produced in 1997 and features interviews with Spielberg, the main cast, and notable crew members. Many other alternative versions were made for network and syndicated television, and the Criterion LaserDisc version. Some of these combined all released material from the 1977 and 1980 versions. However, most of these versions were not edited by Spielberg, who regards the &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; as his definitive version. The &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; was given a limited release as part of a roadshow featuring select films to celebrate Columbia Pictures&#x27;s 75th anniversary in 1999. It was the first time this version of the film had been shown theatrically. This was once again released in theaters on September 1, 2017, in tribute to the film&#x27;s 40th anniversary. It made $1.8 million in the weekend ($2.3 million over the four-day Labor Day holiday), pushing its career global gross to over $306 million worldwide.

&quot;Close Encounters&quot; was released on DVD on May 29, 2001, in a two-disc &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; set that contains only the director&#x27;s cut. This set contains several extra features, including the 1997 documentary, a featurette from 1977, trailers, and deleted scenes that includes the mothership interior from the 1980 &quot;Special Edition&quot;. A single-disc DVD edition was released on August 27, 2002. In tribute to the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary, Sony Pictures released it on DVD and Blu-ray in 2007. For the first time, all three versions were packaged together. Then in 2017, in honor of its 40th anniversary, the film was given a 4K restoration of the original camera negative. Following its theatrical re-release of the director&#x27;s cut, the film was released in 4K and Blu-ray with all three versions given the same 4K treatment.

==Legacy==

Observers credited the &quot;Close Encounters&quot; for launching the reemergence of a large market for science fiction films
in the 1980s alongside &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) and &quot;Superman&quot; (1978). In 1985, Spielberg donated $100,000 to the Planetary Society for Megachannel ExtraTerrestrial Assay.

Shortly after the film&#x27;s release in late 1977, Spielberg considered either a sequel or prequel, but decided against it. He explained, &quot;The army&#x27;s knowledge and ensuing cover-up is so subterranean that it would take a creative screen story, perhaps someone else making the picture and giving it the equal time it deserves.&quot;

When asked in 1980 to select a single &quot;master image&quot; that summed up his film career, Spielberg chose the shot of Barry opening his living room door to see the blazing orange light from the UFO. &quot;That was beautiful but awful light, just like fire coming through the doorway. [Barry&#x27;s] very small, and it&#x27;s a very large door, and there&#x27;s a lot of promise or danger outside that door.&quot; In 2007, &quot;Close Encounters&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and was added to the National Film Registry for preservation. In American Film Institute polls, &quot;Close Encounters&quot; has been voted the 64th-greatest American film, the 31st-most thrilling, and the 58th-most inspiring. It was also nominated for the top 10 science fiction films in AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 and the tenth-anniversary edition of the 100 Movies list. The score by John Williams was nominated for AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Film Scores.

In 2011, ABC aired a primetime special, &quot;Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time&quot;, that counted down the best films chosen by fans based on results of a poll conducted by ABC and &quot;People&quot; magazine. &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; was selected as the #5 Best Sci-Fi Film. &quot;The Guardian&quot; also selected the film as the 11th best Sci-Fi and fantasy film of all time.
In 2024, Close Encounters of the Third Kind was included in Rolling Stone&#x27;s &quot;The 150 Best Science Fiction Movies of All Time&quot; list at #3.

Many prominent directors have cited &quot;Close Encounters&quot; as one of their favorites, among them Stanley Kubrick, Edgar Wright, Bong Joon-ho, Spike Lee, Denis Villeneuve, Guillermo del Toro, Christopher Nolan, Andrew Stanton, Patrick Read Johnson and Michael Williams.

<text>The osprey (; Pandion haliaetus), historically known as sea hawk, river hawk, and fish hawk, is a diurnal, fish-eating bird of prey with a cosmopolitan range. It is a large raptor, reaching more than in length and across the wings. It is brown on the upperparts and predominantly greyish on the head and underparts.

The osprey tolerates a wide variety of habitats, nesting in any location near a body of water providing an adequate food supply. It is found on all continents except Antarctica, although in South America it occurs only as a non-breeding migrant.

As its other common names suggest, the osprey&#x27;s diet consists almost exclusively of fish. It possesses specialised physical characteristics and unique behaviour in hunting its prey. Because of its unique characteristics it is classified in its own taxonomic genus, &quot;Pandion&quot;, and family, Pandionidae.

==Taxonomy==
The osprey was described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus under the name &quot;Falco haliaetus&quot; in his landmark tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as Europe, but in 1761 he restricted the locality to Sweden. The osprey is the only species placed in the genus &quot;Pandion&quot; that was introduced by the French zoologist Marie Jules César Savigny in 1809. The genus is the sole member of the family Pandionidae. The species has always presented a riddle to taxonomists, but here it is treated as the sole living member of the family Pandionidae, and the family listed in its traditional place as part of the order Accipitriformes. Other schemes place it alongside the hawks and eagles in the family Accipitridae. The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy has placed it together with the other diurnal raptors in a greatly enlarged Ciconiiformes, but this results in an unnatural paraphyletic classification. Molecular phylogenetic analysis has found that the family Pandionidae is sister to the family Accipitridae. It is estimated that the two families diverged around 50.8 million years ago.The osprey is unusual in that it is a sole living species that occurs nearly worldwide. Even the few subspecies are not unequivocally separable. There are four generally recognised subspecies, although differences are small, and ITIS lists only the first three.
* &quot;Pandion haliaetus haliaetus&quot; – the Eurasian osprey is the nominate subspecies that occurs across the Palearctic realm and several parts of sub-Saharan Africa from the Azores and the Iberian Peninsula east to Japan and Kamchatka Peninsula, throughout South and Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, Madagascar and much of the African coastline.
* &quot;P. haliaetus carolinensis&quot; – the American or North American osprey occurs from Alaska and Canada to much of Central and South America, except Chile and Patagonia. It is larger, darker bodied and has a paler breast than the European osprey.
* &quot;P. haliaetus ridgwayi&quot; – Ridgway&#x27;s osprey occurs in the Caribbean islands. It has a very pale head and breast and a weak eye mask. It is non-migratory. Its scientific name commemorates Robert Ridgway.
* &quot;P. haliaetus cristatus&quot; – the Australasian osprey is the smallest and most distinctive subspecies that occurs along the entire marine coastline of Australia and some larger freshwater rivers as well as in Tasmania. It is not migratory. Some authorities have assigned it full species-status as &quot;Pandion cristatus&quot;, also known as the eastern osprey. A 2018 genetic study using microsatellite data showed only low genetic divergence between &quot;cristatus&quot; and the other subspecies.

===Fossil record===
Two extinct species were named from the fossil record. &quot;Pandion homalopteron&quot; described by Stuart L. Warter in 1976 was found in marine Middle Miocene deposits of the Barstovian age in the southern part of California. The second species &quot;Pandion lovensis&quot; was described by Jonathan J. Becker in 1985 and found in Florida; it dates to the Late Clarendonian and possibly represents a separate lineage from that of &quot;P. homalopteron&quot; and &quot;P. haliaetus&quot;. A number of claw fossils have been recovered from Pliocene and Pleistocene sediments in Florida and South Carolina.

The oldest recognized family Pandionidae fossils were recovered from the Oligocene age Jebel Qatrani Formation in Faiyum Governorate, Egypt. However, they are not complete enough to assign to a specific genus. Another Pandionidae claw fossil was recovered from Early Oligocene deposits in the Mainz basin, Germany, and was described in 2006 by Gerald Mayr.

===Etymology===
The genus name &quot;Pandion&quot; derives from &quot;Pandíōn&quot; , the mythical Greek king of Athens and grandfather of Theseus, Pandion II. The species name &quot;haliaetus&quot; () comes from Greek &quot;haliáetos&quot; &quot;sea-eagle&quot; (also &quot;haliaietos&quot;) from the combining form &quot;hali-&quot; of &quot;hals&quot; &quot;sea&quot; and &quot;aetos&quot;, &quot;eagle&quot;.

The origins of &quot;osprey&quot; are obscure; the word itself was first recorded around 1460, derived via the Anglo-French &quot;ospriet&quot; and the Medieval Latin &quot;avis prede&quot; &quot;bird of prey,&quot; from the Latin &quot;avis praedae&quot; though the Oxford English Dictionary notes a connection with the Latin &quot;ossifraga&quot; or &quot;bone breaker&quot; of Pliny the Elder. However, this term referred to the bearded vulture.

==Description==
The osprey differs in several respects from other diurnal birds of prey. Its toes are of equal length, its tarsi are , and its talons are rounded, rather than grooved. The osprey and owls are the only raptors whose outer toe is reversible, allowing them to grasp their prey with two toes in front and two behind. This is particularly helpful when they grab slippery fish.
The osprey is in weight and in length with a wingspan. It is, thus, of similar size to the largest members of the &quot;Buteo&quot; or &quot;Falco&quot; genera. The subspecies are fairly close in size, with the nominate subspecies averaging , &quot;P. h. carolinensis&quot; averaging and &quot;P. h. cristatus&quot; averaging . The wing chord measures , the tail measures and the tarsus is .

The upperparts are a deep, glossy brown, while the breast is white, sometimes streaked with brown, and the underparts are pure white. The head is white with a dark mask across the eyes, reaching to the sides of the neck. The irises of the eyes are golden to brown, and the transparent nictitating membrane is pale blue. The bill is black, with a blue cere, and the feet are white with black talons. On the underside of the wings the wrists are black, which serves as a field mark. A short tail and long, narrow wings with four long, finger-like feathers, and a shorter fifth, give it a very distinctive appearance.

The sexes appear fairly similar, but the adult male can be distinguished from the female by its slimmer body and narrower wings. The breast band of the male is also weaker than that of the female or is non-existent, and the underwing coverts of the male are more uniformly pale. It is straightforward to determine the sex in a breeding pair, but harder with individual birds.

The juvenile osprey may be identified by buff fringes to the plumage of the upperparts, a buff tone to the underparts, and streaked feathers on the head. During spring, barring on the underwings and flight feathers is a better indicator of a young bird, due to wear on the upperparts.

In flight, the osprey has arched wings and drooping &quot;hands&quot;, giving it a gull-like appearance. The call is a series of sharp whistles, described as &quot;cheep, cheep,&quot; or &quot;yewk, yewk&quot;. If disturbed by activity near the nest, the call is a frenzied &quot;cheereek&quot;!

==Distribution and habitat==
The osprey is the second most widely distributed raptor species, after the peregrine falcon, and is one of only six land-birds with a worldwide distribution. It is found in temperate and tropical regions of all continents, except Antarctica. In North America it breeds from Alaska and Newfoundland south to the Gulf Coast and Florida, wintering further south from the southern United States through to Argentina. It is found in summer throughout Europe north into Ireland, Scandinavia, Finland and Great Britain though not Iceland, and winters in North Africa. In Australia it is mainly sedentary and found patchily around the coastline, though it is a non-breeding visitor to eastern Victoria and Tasmania.

There is a gap, corresponding with the coast of the Nullarbor Plain, between its westernmost breeding site in South Australia and the nearest breeding sites to the west in Western Australia. In the islands of the Pacific it is found in the Bismarck Islands, Solomon Islands and New Caledonia, and fossil remains of adults and juveniles have been found in Tonga, where it probably was wiped out by arriving humans. It is possible it may once have ranged across Vanuatu and Fiji as well. It is an uncommon to fairly common winter visitor to all parts of South Asia, and Southeast Asia from Myanmar through to Indochina and southern China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Diet===
The osprey is piscivorous, with fish making up 99% of its diet. It typically takes live fish weighing and about in length, but virtually any type of fish from to can be taken. Even larger northern pike (&quot;Esox lucius&quot;) has been taken in Russia. The species rarely scavenges dead or dying fish.

Ospreys have a vision that is well adapted to detecting underwater objects from the air. Prey is first sighted when the osprey is above the water, after which the bird hovers momentarily and then plunges feet first into the water. They catch fish by diving into a body of water, oftentimes completely submerging their entire bodies. As an osprey dives it adjusts the angle of its flight to account for the distortion of the fish&#x27;s image caused by refraction. Ospreys will typically eat on a nearby perch but have also been known to carry fish for longer distances.

Occasionally, the osprey may prey on rodents, rabbits, hares, other mammals, snakes, turtles, frogs, birds, salamanders, conchs, and crustaceans. Reports of ospreys feeding on carrion are rare. They have been observed eating dead white-tailed deer and Virginia opossums.

===Adaptations===
The osprey has several adaptations that suit its piscivorous lifestyle. These include reversible outer toes, sharp on the underside of the toes, closable nostrils to keep out water during dives, backward-facing scales on the talons which act as barbs to help hold its catch and dense plumage which is oily and prevents its feathers from getting waterlogged.

===Reproduction===
The osprey breeds near freshwater lakes and rivers, and sometimes on coastal brackish waters. Rocky outcrops just offshore are used in Rottnest Island off the coast of Western Australia, where there are 14 or so similar nesting sites of which five to seven are used in any one year. Many are renovated each season, and some have been used for 70 years. The nest is a large heap of sticks, driftwood, turf, or seaweed built in forks of trees, rocky outcrops, utility poles, artificial platforms, or offshore islets. As wide as 2 meters and weighing about , large nests on utility poles may be fire hazards and have caused power outages.

Generally, ospreys reach sexual maturity and begin breeding around the age of three to four, though in some regions with high osprey densities, such as Chesapeake Bay in the United States, they may not start breeding until five to seven years old, and there may be a shortage of suitable tall structures. If there are no nesting sites available, young ospreys may be forced to delay breeding. To ease this problem, posts are sometimes erected to provide more sites suitable for nest building. The nesting platform design developed by the organization Citizens United to Protect the Maurice River and Its Tributaries, Inc. has become the official design of the State of New Jersey, U.S. The nesting platform plans and materials list, available online, have been utilized by people from a number of different geographical regions. There is a global site for mapping osprey nest locations and logging observations on reproductive success.

Ospreys usually mate for life. Rarely, polyandry has been recorded. The breeding season varies according to latitude: spring (September–October) in southern Australia, April to July in northern Australia, and winter (June–August) in southern Queensland. In spring, the pair begins a five-month period of partnership to raise their young. The female lays two to four eggs within a month and relies on the size of the nest to conserve heat. The eggs are whitish with bold splotches of reddish-brown and are about and weigh about . The eggs are incubated for about 35–43 days to hatching.

The newly hatched chicks weigh only , but fledge in 8–10 weeks. A study on Kangaroo Island, South Australia, had an average time between hatching and fledging of 69 days. The same study found an average of 0.66 young fledged per year per occupied territory, and 0.92 young fledged per year per active nest. Some 22% of surviving young either remained on the island or returned at maturity to join the breeding population. When food is scarce, the first chicks to hatch are most likely to survive. The typical lifespan is 7–10 years, though rarely individuals can grow to as old as 20–25 years. The oldest European wild osprey on record lived to be over thirty years of age.

===Migration===
European breeders winter in Africa. American and Canadian breeders winter in South America, although some stay in the southernmost U.S. states such as Florida and California. Some ospreys from Florida migrate to South America. Australasian ospreys tend not to migrate.

Studies of Swedish ospreys showed that females tend to migrate to Africa earlier than males. More stopovers are made during their autumn migration. The variation of timing and duration in autumn was more variable than in spring. Although migrating predominantly during the day, they sometimes fly in the dark hours, particularly in crossings over water and cover on average per day with a maximum of per day. European birds may also winter in South Asia, as indicated by an osprey tagged in Norway being monitored in western India. In the Mediterranean, ospreys show partial migratory behaviour with some individuals remaining resident, whilst others undertake relatively short migration trips.

=== Mortality ===
Swedish ospreys have a significantly higher mortality rate during migration seasons than during stationary periods, with more than half of the total annual mortality occurring during migration. These deaths can also be categorized into spatial patterns: Spring mortality occurs mainly in Africa, which can be traced to crossing the Sahara desert. Mortality can also occur through mishaps with human utilities, such as nesting near overhead electric cables or collisions with aircraft.

==Conservation==
The osprey has a large range, covering in just Africa and the Americas, and has a large global population estimated at 460,000 individuals. Although global population trends have not been quantified, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and for these reasons, the species is evaluated as Least Concern. There is evidence for regional decline in South Australia where former territories at locations in the Spencer Gulf and along the lower Murray River have been vacant for decades.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the main threats to osprey populations were egg collectors and hunting of the adults along with other birds of prey, but osprey populations declined drastically in many areas in the 1950s and 1960s; this appeared to be in part due to the toxic effects of insecticides such as DDT on reproduction. The pesticide interfered with the bird&#x27;s calcium metabolism which resulted in thin-shelled, easily broken or infertile eggs. Possibly because of the banning of DDT in many countries in the early 1970s, together with reduced persecution, the osprey, as well as other affected bird of prey species, have made significant recoveries. In South Australia, nesting sites on the Eyre Peninsula and Kangaroo Island are vulnerable to unmanaged coastal recreation and encroaching urban development.

==Cultural depictions==
===Literature===
* The Roman writer Pliny the Elder reported that parent ospreys made their young fly up to the sun as a test, and dispatched any that failed.
* Another odd legend regarding this fish-eating bird of prey, derived from the writings of Albertus Magnus and recorded in Holinshed&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles&quot;, was that it had one webbed foot and one taloned foot.
* The osprey is mentioned in the famous Chinese folk poem &quot;guan guan ju jiu&quot; (關關雎鳩); &quot;ju jiu&quot; 雎鳩 refers to the osprey, and &quot;guan guan&quot; (關關) to its voice. In the poem, the osprey is considered to be an icon of fidelity and harmony between wife and husband, due to its highly monogamous habits. Some commentators have claimed that &quot;ju jiu&quot; in the poem is not the osprey but the mallard duck, since the osprey cannot make the sound &quot;guan guan&quot;.
* The Irish poet William Butler Yeats used a grey wandering osprey as a representation of sorrow in &quot;The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems&quot; (1889).
* There was a medieval belief that fish were so mesmerised by the osprey that they turned belly-up in surrender, and this is referenced by Shakespeare in Act 4 Scene 5 of &quot;Coriolanus&quot;:

===Iconography===
* In heraldry, the osprey is typically depicted as a white eagle, often maintaining a fish in its talons or beak, and termed a &quot;sea-eagle&quot;. It is historically regarded as a symbol of vision and abundance; more recently it has become a symbol of positive responses to nature, and has been featured on more than 50 international postage stamps.
* In 1994, the osprey was declared the provincial bird of Nova Scotia, Canada.

===Sports===
Some sports clubs are named after the osprey such as the University of North Florida&#x27;s North Florida Ospreys and Missoula Osprey baseball team.

&quot;Seahawks&quot;, another term for osprey, is also common among sports teams. The Seattle Seahawks, a professional American football team in the National Football League, received their identity from a naming contest, defeating 1,740 others. According to team general manager John Thompson, the name &quot;shows aggressiveness, reflects our soaring Northwest heritage and belongs to no other major league team.&quot;

===Other===
So-called &quot;osprey&quot; plumes were an important item in the plume trade of the late 19th century and used in hats including those used as part of the army uniform. Despite their name, these plumes were actually obtained from egrets.

During the 2017 regular session of the Oregon Legislature, there was a short-lived controversy over the western meadowlark&#x27;s status as the state bird versus the osprey. The sometimes-spirited debate included state representative Rich Vial playing the meadowlark&#x27;s song on his smartphone over the House microphone. A compromise was reached in SCR 18, which was passed on the last day of the session, designating the western meadowlark as the state songbird and the osprey as the state raptor.

<doc id="146239" wikidata="Q426804" url="?curid=146239" title="Oval tube station">
<text>Oval is a London Underground station in the London Borough of Lambeth. It is on the Northern line between Kennington and Stockwell stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 2. The station opened on 18 December 1890 as part of the City and South London Railway and is named after The Oval cricket ground, which it serves.

==Location==
The station is located at the junction of Kennington Park Road (heading north-east), Camberwell New Road (south-east), Clapham Road (south west) and Harleyford Street (north west) and is about 500 yards from The Oval cricket ground. Also close by are Kennington Park and the imposing St Mark&#x27;s Church.

==History==

The City and South London Railway opened to passengers between Stockwell and King William Street on 18 December 1890, and was both the first standard gauge tube and the first railway to employ electric traction in London. To avoid disturbance of surface buildings the construction of the tube was shield-driven at deep level, and much of the work was done via shafts at station sites which later contained the passenger lifts.

Oval tube station was the intended site of one of the attempted London bombings on 21 July 2005.

==Station building==

The Oval station, opened as Kennington Oval, was designed by Thomas Phillips Figgis with elements of early Arts and Crafts and neo-classical detailing. The structure was made distinctive by a lead-covered dome with cupola lantern and weathervane which housed some of the lift equipment; the main part of the building was of red brick. The station building was rebuilt in the early 1920s when the line was modernised and was refurbished during the late 1990s at street level with a modern tiling scheme inside and out, adding a full-length glazed canopy and giving the station a more modern look. Reflecting its proximity to the cricket ground, the internal decorative tiling features large images of cricketers in various stances.

In 2004, station staff started to use a whiteboard to display a handwritten &quot;thought of the day&quot; from the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; for the benefit of passengers. This idea then spread to other Underground stations such as North Greenwich, where the content relates to events at the nearby O2 Arena.

==Services and connections==
Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 3–6 minutes between 06:03 and 00:27 in both directions.

London Bus routes 3, 36, 59, 133, 155, 159, 185, 333, 415, and 436 and night routes N3, N109, N133, N136, and N155 serve the station.

==In popular culture==
The station was mocked up by the television series &quot;Survivors: The Lights of London parts 1 &amp; 2&quot;, broadcast on BBC One on 14 and 21 April 1976. However, the filmed site was actually at Camden Town deep-level shelter.

<doc id="146244" wikidata="Q661675" url="?curid=146244" title="Chisholm v. Georgia">
<text>Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 419 (1793), is considered the first United States Supreme Court case of significance and impact. Since the case was argued prior to the formal pronouncement of judicial review by &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot; (1803), there was little available legal precedent (particularly in U.S. law). The Court in a 4–1 decision ruled in favor of Alexander Chisholm, executor of an estate of a citizen of South Carolina, holding that Article III, Section 2 grants federal courts jurisdiction in cases between a state and a citizen of another state wherein the state is the defendant.

The case was superseded in 1795 by the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution which was considered binding by the Court in &quot;Hollingsworth v. Virginia&quot; (1798). The Supreme Court formally established sovereign immunity in federal courts in &quot;Hans v. Louisiana&quot; (1890) and state courts in &quot;Alden v. Maine&quot; (1999) using the Eleventh Amendment, effectively overturning their decision.

==Background of the case==
On October 31, 1777, the Executive Council of Georgia authorized Thomas Stone and Edward Davies, as commissioners of the state, to purchase goods from Robert Farquhar, a South Carolina merchant, to help stationed Continental Army troops in Savannah who were in dire need of supplies. Stone and Davies agreed to give Farquhar $169,613.33 (in indigo or continental currency) for his merchandise. However, at the time of Farquhar&#x27;s death in 1784, he had not received payment for his merchandise. The estate filed a claim for the debt with the Georgia legislature in 1789, but was met with a committee report refusing payment. Instead, the committee suggested the estate sue Stone and Davies, as they had withdrawn the funds meant for Farquhar from the state treasury.

=== Prior history ===
Alexander Chisholm, a merchant in Charleston and an executor to Farquhar&#x27;s estate, brought suit against the state of Georgia in the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Georgia. The circuit court heard the case in October 1791 under the caption of &quot;Farquhar&#x27;s Executor v. Georgia&quot;. Chisholm sought £100,000 sterling in payment and damages. Georgia governor Edward Telfair argued that Georgia was &quot;a free, sovereign and independent State...[and] cannot be drawn or compelled... to answer, against the will of the said State of Georgia, before any Justices of the federal Circuit Court for the District of Georgia or before any Justices of any Court of Law or Equity whatsoever&quot;, a stance of sovereign immunity. Associate Justice James Iredell, who heard the case while riding circuit, along with U.S. District Court Judge Nathaniel Pendleton, dismissed the case, citing a lack of jurisdiction under the Judiciary Act of 1789, on grounds that a state could not be sued by a citizen of another state in federal circuit court.

=== Supreme Court ===
Chisholm subsequently filed a new suit before the Supreme Court under its original jurisdiction, likely in the February 1792 term. The case, captioned as &quot;Chisholm, Executor v. Georgia&quot;, sought damages amounting to $500,000. When no representative for Georgia appeared before the Court in the August 1792 term, plaintiff&#x27;s counsels John Hallowell and Attorney General Edmund Randolph consented to hold over the case until the February 1793 term. Despite additional provision of notice by the Court, no attorneys or representatives for the state appeared in the February 1793 term. The Court then proceeded to hear Randolph&#x27;s arguments.

==The court&#x27;s decision==
In a four-to-one decision, the Court held for the plaintiff, with Chief Justice John Jay and associate justices William Cushing, James Wilson, and John Blair constituting the majority; only Justice Iredell dissented. (At that time, there was no &quot;opinion of the court&quot; or &quot;majority opinion&quot;; the justices delivered their opinions &quot;seriatim&quot; or individually, in ascending order of seniority.) The Court ruled that Article 3, Section 2, of the Constitution expressly extended federal judicial power to suits between a state and a citizen of another state, and placed that power within the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Moreover, it held, the Constitution provided no exception which limited that authority only to suits where the state was the plaintiff.

=== Chief Justice John Jay&#x27;s Opinion ===
In his opinion, Chief Justice John Jay begins by breaking down the argument made by the plaintiffs into four different questions:
# &quot;Can the State of Georgia, being one of the United States of America, be made a party-defendant in any case, in the Supreme Court of the United States, at the suit of a private citizen, even although he himself is, and his testator was, a citizen of the State of South Carolina?&quot;
# &quot;If the State of Georgia can be made a party defendant in certain cases, does an action of assumpsit lie against her?&quot;
# &quot; Is the service of the summons upon the Governor and Attorney General of the State of Georgia, a competent service?&quot;
# &quot;By what process ought the appearance of the State of Georgia to be enforced?&quot;

In the opening words of his opinion, Justice Wilson stated the essential principle on which the case turned: &quot;This is a case of uncommon magnitude. One of the parties to it is a State; certainly respectable, claiming to be sovereign. The question to be determined is, whether this State, so respectable, and whose claim soars so high, is amenable to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States? This question, important in itself, will depend on others, more important still; and, may, perhaps, be ultimately resolved into one, no less radical than this &#x27;do the people of the United States form a Nation?&#x27;&quot;

Justice Iredell’s Dissent

In his dissenting opinion, Justice Iredell stated, “A general question of great importance here occurs. What controversy of a civil nature can be maintained against a State by an individual? The framers of the Constitution, I presume, must have meant one of two things: either 1. in the conveyance of that part of the judicial power which did not relate to the execution of the other authorities of the general Government (which it must be admitted are full and discretionary, within the restrictions of the Constitution itself), to refer to antecedent laws for the construction of the general words they use; or, 2. to enable Congress in all such cases to pass all such laws as they might deem necessary and proper to carry the purposes of this Constitution into full effect, either absolutely at their discretion, or at least in cases where prior laws were deficient for such purposes, if any such deficiency existed.” Iredell stated that neither of these things was argued in the case, and reasoned that under common law each State was sovereign, just as under English law, and they could not be sued without their consent.

==Subsequent developments==
Although Justice Iredell&#x27;s was the only dissenting opinion, his opinion ultimately became the law of the land. The States, surprised by the decision of the Supreme Court, called for the 11th Amendment to the Constitution, which precludes a State from being sued in Federal Court without that State&#x27;s consent. By February 1795, 12 of the then 15 states had ratified the 11th Amendment; South Carolina ratified it in 1797, and New Jersey and Pennsylvania took no action on ratification. In 1795, the Eleventh Amendment was ratified to negate the holding in &quot;Chisholm v. Georgia&quot;. Under the 11th Amendment, citizens of one state or of foreign countries can only sue a state with the state&#x27;s consent or if Congress, pursuant to a valid exercise of Fourteenth Amendment remedial powers, abrogates the states&#x27; immunity from suit.

<text>The History of the Britons () is a purported history of early Britain written around 828 that survives in numerous recensions from after the 11th century. The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; is commonly attributed to Nennius, as some recensions have a preface written in that name. Some experts have dismissed the Nennian preface as a late forgery and argued that the work was actually an anonymous compilation.

== Overview ==
The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; describes the supposed settlement of Britain by Trojan settlers and says that Britain was named for Brutus, a descendant of Aeneas. The &quot;single most important source used by Geoffrey of Monmouth in his pseudohistorical &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;&quot; and through the enormous popularity of the latter work, this version of the early history of Britain, including the Trojan origin tradition, was incorporated into subsequent chronicles of the long-running history of the land, such as the Middle English &quot;Brut of England&quot;, also known as &quot;The Chronicles of England&quot;.

The work was the first source to portray King Arthur, who is described as a &quot;dux bellorum&quot; (&#x27;military leader&#x27;) or &quot;miles&quot; (&#x27;warrior, soldier&#x27;) and not as a king. It names the twelve battles that Arthur fought, but, unlike the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;, does not give any actual dates.

The reference in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; to Arthur carrying the image of St. Mary on his shoulders in a battle has been interpreted by later commentators as a mistranslation of Arthur bearing the image of Mary on his shield; the words in Welsh are very similar.

The 19th-century classicist Theodor Mommsen divided the work into seven parts: Preface (&quot;Prefatio Nennii Britonum&quot;); I. The Six Ages of the World (&quot;de sex aetatibus mundi&quot;) (§1-6); II. History of the Britons (&quot;historia Brittonum&quot;) (§7-49); III. Life of Patrick (&quot;vita Patricii&quot;) (§50-55); IV. Arthuriana (§ 56); V. Genealogies (&quot;regum genealogiae cum computo&quot;) (§c. 57–66); VI. Cities of Britain (&quot;civitates Britanniae&quot;) (§66a); VII. Wonders of Britain (&quot;de mirabilibus Britanniae&quot;) (§67—76).

The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; can be dated to about 829. The work was written no earlier than the &quot;fourth year of [the reign of] king Mermenus&quot; (who has been identified as Merfyn Frych ap Gwriad, king of Gwynedd). Historians have conservatively assigned 828 to the earliest date for the work, which is consistent with the statement in chapter 4 that &quot;from the Passion of Christ 796 years have passed. But from his Incarnation are 831 years&quot;.

The text makes use of two narrative techniques that are generally considered not reliable by modern academic standards: synthesizing and synchronizing history. Synthetic history combines legendary elements with fact, which makes the veracity of the text challenging to evaluate. Various specious causal connections and attempts to synchronize material from different sources and traditions also contribute to undermining the reliability of the chronicle.

=== Authorship, recensions and editions ===
The question of the nature of the text of the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; is one that has caused intense debate over the centuries. Some scholars have taken the position that treating the text as anonymously written would be the best approach as theories attributing authorship to Nennius have since been disputed by subsequent scholars.

====Classical debate====
Repudiating the so-called vindication of Nennius in 1890 by the Celtic scholar Heinrich Zimmer, Mommsen returned to the earlier view of a ninth-century Nennius merely building on a seventh-century original, which he dated to around 680. The historian Ferdinand Lot swiftly challenged Mommsen; but it was not until 1925 that the Anglo-Saxon scholar Felix Liebermann offered a major reconstruction of the Mommsen view, arguing that Nennius in fact first put the whole work into shape in the ninth century. Re-analysing the eleven manuscript variants of Mommsen, he produced a two-stemma analysis of their hypothetical descent, noting however that “Only one branch, viz. C2d2 of the second stem, preserves Nennius&#x27;s name”. His overall conclusion (based on uniform particularities of style) was that “The whole work...belongs to Nennius alone”, but this did not prevent him from recognising that “we must lower Nennius&#x27;s rank as a historian...[but] praise his patriotic heart.&quot;

====Recent re-assessments====
The Nennius question was re-opened in the 1970s by the historian David Dumville, who revisited the stemmatics of the various recensions and published the Vatican version. Dumville called the Nennian preface (&quot;Prefatio Nennii&quot;) a late forgery, and believes that the work underwent several anonymous revisions before reaching the forms that now survive in the various families of manuscripts. Dumville&#x27;s view is largely accepted by current scholarship, though not without dissent. Peter Field in particular has argued for the authenticity of the preface, suggesting that it was left out of many recensions because it was seen as derogatory to British scholarship. However, Field believes Liebermann&#x27;s earlier argument for Nennius&#x27;s authorship still bears consideration.

=== Compiler&#x27;s approach ===
Various introductory notes to this work invoke Nennius&#x27;s (or the anonymous compiler&#x27;s) words from the &quot;Prefatio&quot; that &quot;I heaped together (&quot;coacervavi&quot;) all I could find&quot; from various sources, not only concrete works in writing but &quot;our ancient traditions&quot; (i.e. oral sources) as well. This is quoted from the &quot;Apologia&quot; version of the preface. Giles&#x27;s translation rendered this as &quot;I put together&quot;, obscuring the fact that this is indeed a quote from the work and not from some commentator &quot;(See Morris&#x27;s more recent translation as given in wikiquote: Historia Brittonum)&quot;. Leslie Alcock was not the first to draw attention to the phrase though he may have started the recent spate of interest.

==Arthuriana==
The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; has drawn attention because of its role in influencing the legends and myths surrounding King Arthur. It is the earliest source that presents Arthur as a historical figure, and is the source of several stories which were repeated and amplified by later authors.

===Vortigern and Ambrosius===
The &quot;Historia&quot; contains a story of the king Vortigern, who allowed the Saxons to settle in the island of Britain in return for the hand of Hengist&#x27;s daughter. One legend about Vortigern says he tried to build a stronghold near Snowdon called Dinas Emrys, only to have his building materials disappear every time he tried. His advisers told him to sprinkle the blood of a fatherless boy on the site to lift the curse. Vortigern found such a youth in Ambrosius, who rebuked the wise men and revealed that the disturbance was caused by two dragons buried underground.

The tower story is repeated and embellished by Geoffrey of Monmouth in his &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, though he attributes it to Merlin, saying &quot;Ambrosius&quot; is the sage&#x27;s alternative name. Geoffrey includes Aurelius Ambrosius, another figure mentioned in the &quot;Historia&quot;, as a king in his own right, and also includes other characters such as Vortimer and Bishop Germanus of Auxerre.

===Arthur&#x27;s battles===
Chapter 56 discusses twelve battles fought and won by Arthur, here called &quot;dux bellorum&quot; (war leader) rather than king:

Many of these battle sites are obscure and cannot be identified with any certitude. Some appear in other Welsh literature, though not necessarily explicitly connected to Arthur. Some scholars have proposed that the author incorporated the list from a now-lost Old Welsh poem, based on the fact that some of the names appear to rhyme, The odd description of Arthur bearing the image of the Virgin Mary on his shoulders at Guinnion might stem from a conflation of the Welsh word (shield) with (shoulders). Others reject this as untenable, arguing that the author included battles not previously associated with Arthur, perhaps even made them up entirely.

A similar story to that attached to Guinnion also appears in the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;; here, Arthur is described as carrying &quot;the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ on his shoulders for three days and three nights…&quot;, though here the battle is said to be Badon rather than Guinnion. T. M. Charles-Edwards argues that these accounts both refer to a single source. Other scholars, however, such as Thomas Jones and N. J. Higham, argue that the &quot;Annales&quot; account is based directly on the &quot;Historia&quot;, suggesting the name of the battle was switched from the unknown Guinnion to the famous Badon, and that the icon Arthur carries was replaced with a more common one.

The Battle of Mount Badon is associated with Arthur in several later texts, but not in any that predate the &quot;Historia&quot;. It was clearly a historical battle described by Gildas, who does not mention the name of the Britons&#x27; leader. He does however mention Aurelius Ambrosius as a great scourge of the Saxons immediately prior. Of the other battles, only the Battle of Tribruit is generally agreed to be associated with Arthur in another early Welsh source. Tribruit appears as &quot;Tryfrwyd&quot; in the Old Welsh poem &quot;Pa Gur?&quot;, dating to perhaps the mid-ninth century. This poem follows the story of a battle against , or dogheads, whom Arthur&#x27;s men fought in the mountains of &quot;Eidyn&quot; (Edinburgh); in the Tryfrwyd battle they spar with a character named Garwlwyd (Rough-Gray), who is likely the Gwrgi Garwlwyd (Man-Dog Rough-Grey) who appears in one of the Welsh Triads. Arthur&#x27;s main protagonist in the fight is Bedwyr, later known as Sir Bedivere, and the poem also mentions the euhemerized god Manawydan. &quot;The City of the Legion&quot; may be a reference to Caerleon, whose name translates as such, but it might also refer to Chester, the site of a large Roman base.

&quot;Cat Coit Celidon&quot; is probably a reference to the Caledonian Forest (&quot;Coed Celyddon&quot;) which once covered the Southern Uplands of Scotland. Scholar Marged Haycock has suggested that this battle can be identified with the &quot;Cad Goddeu&quot;, the &quot;Battle of the Trees&quot;, best known from the tenth-century poem &quot;Cad Goddeu&quot;. Arthur is mentioned towards the end of this poem, and a fragment of a story about the battle preserved in manuscript Peniarth 98B states that the battle had an alternate name, &quot;Cad Achren&quot;, which suggests a connection with the &quot;Caer Ochren&quot; raided by Arthur in the earlier poem &quot;Preiddeu Annwfn&quot;.

Various writers have asserted that this chapter supports a historical basis for King Arthur and have tried to identify the twelve battles with historical feuds or locales (see Sites and places associated with Arthurian legend). On the other hand, Caitlin Green argues that the only identifiable battles linked explicitly with Arthur in Old Welsh sources are mythological, undermining any claims that the battles had a basis in history.

===Mirabilia===
Attached to the &quot;Historia&quot; is a section called &quot;De mirabilibus Britanniae&quot; (or simply &quot;Mirabilia&quot; for short, a Latin word meaning &#x27;marvels, miracles&#x27;). It gives a list of 13 topographical marvels, or wonders of Britain, followed by a few marvels of Anglesey (&quot;Menand insulae&quot; or Mona) and of Ireland. The &quot;Mirabilia&quot; section is thought to not be part of the original work, but to have been composed shortly after (early 9th cent.).

Two of the marvels are Arthurian lore (Chapter 73 of the &quot;Historia&quot;). Old editions give &quot;Troynt&quot; as the name of the great boar and &quot;Anir&quot; as the name of Arthur&#x27;s tragic son in the Harleian manuscript, but Fletcher suggested the variant readings &quot;Troit&quot; and &quot;Amr&quot; be preferred since they are closer to the Welsh forms of those names.
The first concerns Arthur&#x27;s dog, Cabal (Cavall in Welsh) and the footprint it left while chasing the boar Troynt (→Troit) Twrch Trwyth:
The second concerns Arthur&#x27;s son Anir or Amr (Amhar in Welsh) and his sepulchre:
==Germanus==
Chapters relating events in the life of Saint Germanus of Auxerre claim to be excerpts from a (now lost) biography of the saint. The document includes a collection of traditions about Saint Patrick, as well as a section describing events in the North of England in the sixth and seventh centuries, starting with a paragraph about the beginnings of Welsh literature

==Associated works==

A number of works that are frequently associated with the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, in part because some of them first appear with the Harleian manuscript, and partly because when the &quot;Historia Britonum&quot; is studied, these sources are eventually mentioned.
*The Frankish Table of Nations. Written around 520, this is a short genealogical text in the mould of the Biblical Table of Nations. Both tables are incorporated into the genealogical sections of the &quot;Historia&quot;. The Frankish Table transmits to the &quot;Historia&quot; some information derived from Tacitus&#x27; &quot;Germania&quot;, albeit in garbled form. It is probably Byzantine in origin.
*The &quot;Lebor Bretnach&quot;. An Irish translation of the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; and a recension of the &#x27;Nennian&#x27; &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;.
*The &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;. This is a chronicle consisting of a series of unnumbered years, from AD 445 to 977, some of which have events added. Two notable events are next to AD 516, which describes The Battle of Badon, and 537, which describes the Battle of Camlann, &quot;in which Arthur and Mordred fell.&quot; A version of this was used as a starting point for later Welsh Chronicles.
*Welsh Genealogies. One of many collections of Welsh genealogies, this documents the lineage of Hywel Dda, king of Wales, and several of his contemporaries. The Pillar of Eliseg is frequently discussed in connection with these genealogies.
*Anglo-Saxon Genealogies, a collection of genealogies of the kings of five pre-Viking kingdoms – Bernicia, Deira, Kent, East Anglia, and Mercia. A similar collection either derived from or sharing a similar source with this collection is found in the stand-alone Anglian collection of royal pedigrees, and embedded within annals of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.

<doc id="146249" wikidata="Q857867" url="?curid=146249" title="Earth's outer core">
<text>Earth&#x27;s outer core is a fluid layer about thick, composed of mostly iron and nickel that lies above Earth&#x27;s solid inner core and below its mantle. The outer core begins approximately beneath Earth&#x27;s surface at the core-mantle boundary and ends beneath Earth&#x27;s surface at the inner core boundary.

==Properties==
The outer core of Earth is liquid, unlike its inner core, which is solid. Evidence for a fluid outer core includes seismology which shows that seismic shear-waves are not transmitted through the outer core. Although having a composition similar to Earth&#x27;s solid inner core, the outer core remains liquid as there is not enough pressure to keep it in a solid state.

Seismic inversions of body waves and normal modes constrain the radius of the outer core to be 3483 km with an uncertainty of 5 km, while that of the inner core is 1220±10 km.

Estimates for the temperature of the outer core are about in its outer region and near the inner core. Modeling has shown that the outer core, because of its high temperature, is a low-viscosity fluid that convects turbulently. The dynamo theory sees eddy currents in the nickel-iron fluid of the outer core as the principal source of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. The average magnetic field strength in Earth&#x27;s outer core is estimated to be 2.5 millitesla, 50 times stronger than the magnetic field at the surface.

As Earth&#x27;s core cools, the liquid at the inner core boundary freezes, causing the solid inner core to grow at the expense of the outer core, at an estimated rate of 1 mm per year. This is approximately 80,000 tonnes of iron per second.

== Light elements of Earth&#x27;s outer core ==
=== Composition ===
Earth&#x27;s outer core cannot be entirely constituted of iron or iron-nickel alloy because their densities are higher than geophysical measurements of the density of Earth&#x27;s outer core. In fact, Earth&#x27;s outer core is approximately 5 to 10 percent lower density than iron at Earth&#x27;s core temperatures and pressures. Hence it has been proposed that light elements with low atomic numbers compose part of Earth&#x27;s outer core, as the only feasible way to lower its density. Although Earth&#x27;s outer core is inaccessible to direct sampling, the composition of light elements can be meaningfully constrained by high-pressure experiments, calculations based on seismic measurements, models of Earth&#x27;s accretion, and carbonaceous chondrite meteorite comparisons with bulk silicate Earth (BSE). Recent estimates are that Earth&#x27;s outer core is composed of iron along with 0 to 0.26 percent hydrogen, 0.2 percent carbon, 0.8 to 5.3 percent oxygen, 0 to 4.0 percent silicon, 1.7 percent sulfur, and 5 percent nickel by weight, and the temperature of the core-mantle boundary and the inner core boundary ranges from 4,137 to 4,300 K and from 5,400 to 6,300 K respectively.

==== Constraints ====
===== Accretion =====
The variety of light elements present in Earth&#x27;s outer core is constrained in part by Earth&#x27;s accretion. Namely, the light elements contained must have been abundant during Earth&#x27;s formation, must be able to partition into liquid iron at low pressures, and must not volatilize and escape during Earth&#x27;s accretionary process.

===== CI chondrites =====
CI chondritic meteorites are believed to contain the same planet-forming elements in the same proportions as in the early Solar System, so differences between CI meteorites and BSE can provide insights into the light element composition of Earth&#x27;s outer core. For instance, the depletion of silicon in BSE compared to CI meteorites may indicate that silicon was absorbed into Earth&#x27;s core; however, a wide range of silicon concentrations in Earth&#x27;s outer and inner core is still possible.

=== Implications for Earth&#x27;s accretion and core formation history ===
Tighter constraints on the concentrations of light elements in Earth&#x27;s outer core would provide a better understanding of Earth&#x27;s accretion and core formation history.

==== Consequences for Earth&#x27;s accretion ====
Models of Earth&#x27;s accretion could be better tested if we had better constraints on light element concentrations in Earth&#x27;s outer core. For example, accretionary models based on core-mantle element partitioning tend to support proto-Earths constructed from reduced, condensed, and volatile-free material, despite the possibility that oxidized material from the outer Solar System was accreted towards the conclusion of Earth&#x27;s accretion. If we could better constrain the concentrations of hydrogen, oxygen, and silicon in Earth&#x27;s outer core, models of Earth&#x27;s accretion that match these concentrations would presumably better constrain Earth’s formation.

==== Consequences for Earth&#x27;s core formation ====
The depletion of siderophile elements in Earth&#x27;s mantle compared to chondritic meteorites is attributed to metal-silicate reactions during formation of Earth&#x27;s core. These reactions are dependent on oxygen, silicon, and sulfur, so better constraints on concentrations of these elements in Earth&#x27;s outer core will help elucidate the conditions of formation of Earth&#x27;s core.

In another example, the possible presence of hydrogen in Earth&#x27;s outer core suggests that the accretion of Earth’s water was not limited to the final stages of Earth&#x27;s accretion and that water may have been absorbed into core-forming metals through a hydrous magma ocean.

=== Implications for Earth&#x27;s magnetic field ===
Earth&#x27;s magnetic field is driven by thermal convection and also by chemical convection, the exclusion of light elements from the inner core, which float upward within the fluid outer core while denser elements sink. This chemical convection releases gravitational energy that is then available to power the geodynamo that produces Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. Carnot efficiencies with large uncertainties suggest that compositional and thermal convection contribute about 80 percent and 20 percent respectively to the power of Earth&#x27;s geodynamo. Traditionally it was thought that prior to the formation of Earth&#x27;s inner core, Earth&#x27;s geodynamo was mainly driven by thermal convection. However, recent claims that the thermal conductivity of iron at core temperatures and pressures is much higher than previously thought imply that core cooling was largely by conduction not convection, limiting the ability of thermal convection to drive the geodynamo. This conundrum is known as the new &quot;core paradox.&quot; An alternative process that could have sustained Earth&#x27;s geodynamo requires Earth&#x27;s core to have initially been hot enough to dissolve oxygen, magnesium, silicon, and other light elements. As the Earth&#x27;s core began to cool, it would become supersaturated in these light elements that would then precipitate into the lower mantle forming oxides leading to a different variant of chemical convection.

The magnetic field generated by core flow is essential to protect life from interplanetary radiation and prevent the atmosphere from dissipating in the solar wind. The rate of cooling by conduction and convection is uncertain, but one estimate is that the core would not be expected to freeze up for approximately 91 billion years, which is well after the Sun is expected to expand, sterilize the surface of the planet, and then burn out.

<text>Carbon-14, C-14, C or radiocarbon, is a radioactive isotope of carbon with an atomic nucleus containing 6 protons and 8 neutrons. Its presence in organic matter is the basis of the radiocarbon dating method pioneered by Willard Libby and colleagues (1949) to date archaeological, geological and hydrogeological samples. Carbon-14 was discovered on February 27, 1940, by Martin Kamen and Sam Ruben at the University of California Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, California. Its existence had been suggested by Franz Kurie in 1934.

There are three naturally occurring isotopes of carbon on Earth: carbon-12 (C), which makes up 99% of all carbon on Earth; carbon-13 (C), which makes up 1%; and carbon-14 (C), which occurs in trace amounts, making up about 1-1.5 atoms per 10 atoms of carbon in the atmosphere. C and C are both stable; C is unstable, with half-life years. Carbon-14 has a specific activity of 62.4 mCi/mmol (2.31 GBq/mmol), or 164.9 GBq/g. Carbon-14 decays into nitrogen-14 () through beta decay. A gram of carbon containing 1 atom of carbon-14 per 10 atoms, emits ~0.2 beta (β) particles per second. The primary natural source of carbon-14 on Earth is cosmic ray action on nitrogen in the atmosphere, and it is therefore a cosmogenic nuclide. However, open-air nuclear testing between 1955 and 1980 contributed to this pool.

The different isotopes of carbon do not differ appreciably in their chemical properties. This resemblance is used in chemical and biological research, in a technique called carbon labeling: carbon-14 atoms can be used to replace nonradioactive carbon, in order to trace chemical and biochemical reactions involving carbon atoms from any given organic compound.

==Radioactive decay and detection==
Carbon-14 undergoes beta decay:

: → + + + 0.156.5 MeV

By emitting an electron and an electron antineutrino, one of the neutrons in carbon-14 decays to a proton and the carbon-14 (half-life of years) decays into the stable (non-radioactive) isotope nitrogen-14.

As usual with beta decay, almost all the decay energy is carried away by the beta particle and the neutrino. The emitted beta particles have a maximum energy of about 156 keV, while their weighted mean energy is 49 keV. These are relatively low energies; the maximum distance traveled is estimated to be 22 cm in air and 0.27 mm in body tissue. The fraction of the radiation transmitted through the dead skin layer is estimated to be 0.11. Small amounts of carbon-14 are not easily detected by typical Geiger–Müller (G-M) detectors; it is estimated that G-M detectors will not normally detect contamination of less than about 100,000 decays per minute (0.05 μCi). Liquid scintillation counting is the preferred method although more recently, accelerator mass spectrometry has become the method of choice; it counts all the carbon-14 atoms in the sample and not just the few that happen to decay during the measurements; it can therefore be used with much smaller samples (as small as individual plant seeds), and gives results much more quickly. The G-M counting efficiency is estimated to be 3%. The half-distance layer in water is 0.05 mm.

==Radiocarbon dating==

Radiocarbon dating is a radiometric dating method that uses C to determine the age of carbonaceous materials up to about 60,000 years old. The technique was developed by Willard Libby and his colleagues in 1949 during his tenure as a professor at the University of Chicago. Libby estimated that the radioactivity of exchangeable C would be about 14 decays per minute (dpm) per gram of carbon, and this is still used as the activity of the &quot;modern radiocarbon standard&quot;. In 1960, Libby was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for this work.

One of the frequent uses of the technique is to date organic remains from archaeological sites. Plants fix atmospheric carbon during photosynthesis; so the level of C in plants and animals when they die, roughly equals the level of C in the atmosphere at that time. However, it thereafter decreases exponentially; so the date of death or fixation can be estimated. The initial C level for the calculation can either be estimated, or else directly compared with known year-by-year data from tree-ring data (dendrochronology) up to 10,000 years ago (using overlapping data from live and dead trees in a given area), or else from cave deposits (speleothems), back to about 45,000 years before present. A calculation or (more accurately) a direct comparison of carbon-14 levels in a sample, with tree ring or cave-deposit C levels of a known age, then gives the wood or animal sample age-since-formation. Radiocarbon is also used to detect disturbance in natural ecosystems; for example, in peatland landscapes, radiocarbon can indicate that carbon which was previously stored in organic soils is being released due to land clearance or climate change.

Cosmogenic nuclides are also used as proxy data to characterize cosmic particle and solar activity of the distant past.

==Origin==

===Natural production in the atmosphere===

Carbon-14 is produced in the upper troposphere and the stratosphere by thermal neutrons absorbed by nitrogen atoms. When cosmic rays enter the atmosphere, they undergo various transformations, including the production of neutrons. The resulting neutrons (n) participate in the following n-p reaction (p is proton):

: + n → + p + 0.626 MeV

The highest rate of carbon-14 production takes place at altitudes of and at high geomagnetic latitudes.

The rate of C production can be modeled, yielding values of 16,400 or 18,800 atoms of per second per square meter of Earth&#x27;s surface, which agrees with the global carbon budget that can be used to backtrack, but attempts to measure the production time directly &quot;in situ&quot; were not very successful. Production rates vary because of changes to the cosmic ray flux caused by the heliospheric modulation (solar wind and solar magnetic field), and, of great significance, due to variations in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. Changes in the carbon cycle however can make such effects difficult to isolate and quantify.

Occasional spikes may occur; for example, there is evidence for an unusually high production rate in AD 774–775, caused by an extreme
solar energetic particle event, the strongest such event to have occurred within the last ten millennia. Another &quot;extraordinarily large&quot; C increase (2%) has been associated with a 5480 BC event, which is unlikely to be a solar energetic particle event.

Carbon-14 may also be produced by lightning but in amounts negligible, globally, compared to cosmic ray production. Local effects of cloud-ground discharge through sample residues are unclear, but possibly significant.

===Other carbon-14 sources===
Carbon-14 can also be produced by other neutron reactions, including in particular C(n,γ)C and O(n,α)C with thermal neutrons, and N(n,d)C and O(n,He)C with fast neutrons. The most notable routes for C production by thermal neutron irradiation of targets (e.g., in a nuclear reactor) are summarized in the table. 

Another source of carbon-14 is cluster decay branches from traces of naturally occurring isotopes of radium, though this decay mode has a branching ratio on the order of relative to alpha decay, so radiogenic carbon-14 is extremely rare.

===Formation during nuclear tests===

The above-ground nuclear tests that occurred in several countries in 1955-1980 (see List of nuclear tests) dramatically increased the amount of C in the atmosphere and subsequently the biosphere; after the tests ended, the atmospheric concentration of the isotope began to decrease, as radioactive CO was fixed into plant and animal tissue, and dissolved in the oceans.

One side-effect of the change in atmospheric C is that this has enabled some options (e.g. bomb-pulse dating) for determining the birth year of an individual, in particular, the amount of C in tooth enamel, or the carbon-14 concentration in the lens of the eye.

In 2019, Scientific American reported that carbon-14 from nuclear testing has been found in animals from one of the most inaccessible regions on Earth, the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean.

The concentration of C in atmospheric CO, reported as the C/C ratio with respect to a standard, has (since about 2022) declined to levels similar to those prior to the above-ground nuclear tests of the 1950s and 1960s. Though the extra C generated by those nuclear tests has not disappeared from the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere, it is diluted due to the Suess effect.

=== Emissions from nuclear power plants ===
Carbon-14 is produced in coolant at boiling water reactors (BWRs) and pressurized water reactors (PWRs). It is typically released into the air in the form of carbon dioxide at BWRs, and methane at PWRs. Best practice for nuclear power plant operator management of carbon-14 includes releasing it at night, when plants are not photosynthesizing. Carbon-14 is also generated inside nuclear fuels (some due to transmutation of oxygen in the uranium oxide, but most significantly from transmutation of nitrogen-14 impurities), and if the spent fuel is sent to nuclear reprocessing then the C is released, for example as CO during PUREX.

==Occurrence==

=== Dispersion in the environment ===
After production in the upper atmosphere, the carbon-14 reacts rapidly to form mostly (about 93%) CO (carbon monoxide), which subsequently oxidizes at a slower rate to form , radioactive carbon dioxide. The gas mixes rapidly and becomes evenly distributed throughout the atmosphere (the mixing timescale on the order of weeks). Carbon dioxide also dissolves in water and thus permeates the oceans, but at a slower rate. The atmospheric half-life for removal of has been estimated at roughly 12 to 16 years in the Northern Hemisphere. The transfer between the ocean shallow layer and the large reservoir of bicarbonates in the ocean depths occurs at a limited rate.
In 2009 the activity of was 238 Bq per kg carbon of fresh terrestrial biomatter, close to the values before atmospheric nuclear testing (226 Bq/kg C; 1950).

===Total inventory===
The inventory of carbon-14 in Earth&#x27;s biosphere is about 300 megacuries (11 EBq), of which most is in the oceans.
The following inventory of carbon-14 has been given:
* Global inventory: ~8500 PBq (about 50 t)
** Atmosphere: 140 PBq (840 kg)
** Terrestrial materials: the balance
* From nuclear testing (until 1990): 220 PBq (1.3 t)

===In fossil fuels===

Many human-made chemicals are derived from fossil fuels (such as petroleum or coal) in which C is greatly depleted because the age of fossils far exceeds the half-life of C. The relative absence of is therefore used to determine the relative contribution (or mixing ratio) of fossil fuel oxidation to the total carbon dioxide in a given region of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

Dating a specific sample of fossilized carbonaceous material is more complicated. Such deposits often contain trace amounts of C. These amounts can vary significantly between samples, ranging up to 1% of the ratio found in living organisms (an apparent age of about 40,000 years). This may indicate contamination by small amounts of bacteria, underground sources of radiation causing a N(n,p)C reaction, direct uranium decay (though reported measured ratios of C/U in uranium-bearing ores would imply roughly 1 uranium atom for every two carbon atoms in order to cause the C/C ratio, measured to be on the order of 10), or other unknown secondary sources of C production. The presence of C in the isotopic signature of a sample of carbonaceous material possibly indicates its contamination by biogenic sources or the decay of radioactive material in surrounding geologic strata. In connection with building the Borexino solar neutrino observatory, petroleum feedstock (for synthesizing the primary scintillant) was obtained with low C content. In the Borexino Counting Test Facility, a C/C ratio of 1.94×10 was determined; probable reactions responsible for varied levels of C in different petroleum reservoirs, and the lower C levels in methane, have been discussed by Bonvicini et al.

===In the human body===
Since many sources of human food are ultimately derived from terrestrial plants, the relative concentration of C in human bodies is nearly identical to the relative concentration in the atmosphere. The rates of disintegration of potassium-40 (K) and C in the normal adult body are comparable (a few thousand decays per second). The beta decays from external (environmental) radiocarbon contribute about 0.01 mSv/year (1 mrem/year) to each person&#x27;s dose of ionizing radiation. This is small compared to the doses from K (0.39 mSv/year) and radon (variable).

C can be used as a radioactive tracer in medicine. In the initial variant of the urea breath test, a diagnostic test for &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;, urea labeled with about C is fed to a patient (i.e. 37,000 decays per second). In the event of a &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection, the bacterial urease enzyme breaks down the urea into ammonia and radioactively-labeled carbon dioxide, which can be detected by low-level counting of the patient&#x27;s breath.

<text>Martin David Kamen (August 27, 1913, Toronto – August 31, 2002, Montecito, California) was an American chemist who, together with Sam Ruben, co-discovered the synthesis of the isotope carbon-14 on February 27, 1940, at the University of California Radiation Laboratory, Berkeley. He also confirmed that all of the oxygen released in photosynthesis comes from water, not carbon dioxide, in 1941. 

Kamen was the first to use carbon-14 to study a biochemical system, and his work revolutionized biochemistry and molecular biology, enabling scientists to trace a wide variety of biological reactions and processes. Despite being blacklisted for nearly a decade on suspicion of being a security risk, Kamen went on to receive the Albert Einstein World Award of Science in 1989, and the U.S. Department of Energy&#x27;s 1995 Enrico Fermi award for lifetime scientific achievement.

==Early life and education==
Kamen was born on August 27, 1913, in Toronto, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants. He grew up in Chicago. Interested in classical music, he initially entered the University of Chicago as a music student before changing his major from music to chemistry. Although he gave up music as a career, Kamen continued to play the viola at a high professional level during the rest of his life. 

Kamen received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemistry from the University of Chicago in 1933. In 1936, Kamen earned a PhD in physical chemistry from the same university after working with William D. Harkins on &quot;Neutron-Proton Inter-action: The Scattering of Neutrons by Protons.&quot;

==Career==
From 1936 to 1944, Kamen worked at the Radiation laboratories at the University of California, Berkeley.
Kamen gained a research position in chemistry and nuclear physics under Ernest Lawrence by working without pay for six months, until he was hired to oversee the preparation and distribution of the cyclotron&#x27;s products. 
Kamen&#x27;s major achievements during his time at Berkeley included the co-discovery of the synthesis of carbon-14 with Sam Ruben in 1940, and the confirmation that all of the oxygen released in photosynthesis comes from water, not carbon dioxide, in 1941.

From 1941 to 1944, Kamen and others at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory worked on the Manhattan Project.
In 1943, Kamen was assigned to Manhattan Project work at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where he worked briefly before returning to Berkeley. 
In spite of the fact that his scientific capabilities were unquestioned, Kamen was fired from Berkeley in July 1944 on suspicion of being a security risk. He was suspected of leaking nuclear weapons secrets to the Soviet Union (which at the time was allied with the US and others against Nazi Germany).

Kamen was unable to obtain another academic position until 1945 when he was hired by Arthur Holly Compton to run the cyclotron program in the medical school of Washington University in St. Louis. Kamen taught the faculty how to use radioactive tracer materials in research, and continued to develop his interests in biochemistry. His book &quot;Isotopic Tracers in Biology&quot; (1947) became a standard text on tracer methodology and highly influenced tracer use in biochemistry.

In 1957, Kamen moved to Brandeis University in Massachusetts where he helped Nathan Oram Kaplan to establish the Graduate Department of Biochemistry.
In 1961 Kamen joined the University of California, San Diego, where he founded a biochemistry group as part of the university&#x27;s new department of chemistry.
Kamen remained at the University of California, San Diego, retiring from teaching (but not research) to become an emeritus professor in 1978.

Martin Kamen died August 31, 2002, at the age of 89 in Montecito (Santa Barbara), California.

==Research==
Although carbon-14 was previously known, the discovery of the synthesis of carbon-14 occurred at Berkeley in 1940 when Kamen and Sam Ruben bombarded graphite in the cyclotron in hopes of producing a radioactive isotope of carbon that could be used as a tracer in investigating chemical reactions in photosynthesis. Their experiment resulted in production of carbon-14.
By bombarding matter with particles in the cyclotron, radioactive isotopes such as carbon-14 were generated. Using carbon-14, the order of events in biochemical reactions could be elucidated, showing the precursors of a particular biochemical product, revealing the network of reactions that constitute life.

Kamen confirmed in 1941 that all of the oxygen released in photosynthesis comes from water, not carbon dioxide. He also studied anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, the biochemistry of cytochromes and their role in photosynthesis and metabolism, photosynthetic bacteria, the role of molybdenum in biological nitrogen fixation, the role of iron in the activity of porphyrin compounds in plants and animals, and calcium exchange in cancerous tumors, making substantial contributions.

==Security risk controversy==
Kamen came under long-term suspicion of espionage activity as a result of two incidents in 1944. He has described his experiences during this era in his autobiography, &quot;Radiant Science, Dark Politics&quot;. He first aroused suspicion while working at Oak Ridge. A cyclotron operator prepared radioactive sodium for an experiment, and Kamen was surprised that the resulting sodium had a purple glow, indicating it was much more intensely radioactive than could be produced in a cyclotron. Kamen recognized immediately that the sodium must have been irradiated in a nuclear reactor elsewhere in the facility. Because of wartime secrecy, he had not been aware of the reactor&#x27;s existence. He excitedly told Ernest O. Lawrence about his discovery, in the hearing of Lawrence&#x27;s Army escort. Shortly thereafter, an investigation was launched to find out who had leaked the information to Kamen.

After returning to Berkeley, Kamen met two Russian officials at a party given by his friend, the violinist Isaac Stern, whom he sometimes accompanied as a viola player in social evenings of chamber music. The Russians were Grigory Kheifets and Grigory Kasparov, posted as undercover KGB officers in the Soviet Union&#x27;s San Francisco consulate. One of them asked Kamen for assistance in getting in touch with Rad Lab scientist John H. Lawrence about an experimental radiation treatment for a colleague with leukemia (Commander Kalinin of the Russian Navy, under treatment at the United States Navy Hospital in Seattle, Washington). Kamen put them in contact, and in appreciation he was invited for dinner at a local restaurant. FBI agents observed the dinner, on July 1, 1944, took a photograph of the men together, and submitted a report alleging Kamen to have discussed atomic research with Kheifets. In a memorandum of July 11, 1944, Army officials ordered Lawrence to have Martin Kamen dismissed from his Berkeley position and his work on the Manhattan Project on suspicion of being a “security risk.” There was no hearing or method of appeal.

In addition, Ruth B. Shipley at the Passport Division of the State Department revoked Kamen&#x27;s passport in 1947, and repeatedly refused to reissue it. This had significant negative effects on Kamen&#x27;s career and research, preventing him from traveling abroad to give lectures, attend conferences, and take up visiting professorships. 
In 1948, the House Committee on Un-American Activities summoned Kamen to testify about his dinner conversation of 1944. From 1947-1955 Kamen engaged in repeated attempts to regain his passport and to engage in international scientific activities. He sought legal counsel in 1950, and started litigation to regain his passport and right to travel, gaining support from the Federation of American Scientists, the American Civil Liberties Union and others.

In 1951 the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; published an article that named him as a suspected spy for the Soviets, further damaging his reputation. Soon after, Kamen attempted suicide. He went on to sue the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Washington Times-Herald&quot; for libel, winning his suit in 1955. It took Kamen nearly 10 years to establish his innocence and prove that he had been unjustly blacklisted as a security risk. He was finally able to regain his passport as of July 9, 1955.

==Awards and honors==
Kamen was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1941. He became a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958. In 1962, Kamen was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1974. 

Kamen became a Guggenheim Fellowship recipient in 1956 and again in 1972, in the field of Molecular and Cellular Biology.
Kamen was awarded the Charles F. Kettering Award for Excellence in Photosynthesis Research from the American Society of Plant Biologists in 1968 and the Merck Award of the American Society of Biological Chemists in 1982.
He received the 1989 Albert Einstein World Award of Science. On April 24, 1996, he was presented with the 1995 Enrico Fermi Award, given by the U.S. President and the Department of Energy for lifetime scientific achievement. Some believe he should have won a Nobel Prize, for which he was nominated 14 times between 1955 and 1970.

<doc id="146253" wikidata="Q190688" url="?curid=146253" title="Shock wave">
<text>In physics, a shock wave (also spelled shockwave), or shock, is a type of propagating disturbance that moves faster than the local speed of sound in the medium. Like an ordinary wave, a shock wave carries energy and can propagate through a medium, but is characterized by an abrupt, nearly discontinuous, change in pressure, temperature, and density of the medium.

For the purpose of comparison, in supersonic flows, additional increased expansion may be achieved through an expansion fan, also known as a Prandtl–Meyer expansion fan. The accompanying expansion wave may approach and eventually collide and recombine with the shock wave, creating a process of destructive interference. The sonic boom associated with the passage of a supersonic aircraft is a type of sound wave produced by constructive interference.

Unlike solitons (another kind of nonlinear wave), the energy and speed of a shock wave alone dissipates relatively quickly with distance. When a shock wave passes through matter, energy is preserved but entropy increases. This change in the matter&#x27;s properties manifests itself as a decrease in the energy which can be extracted as work, and as a drag force on supersonic objects; shock waves are strongly irreversible processes.

== Terminology ==
Shock waves can be:
; Normal: At 90° (perpendicular) to the shock medium&#x27;s flow direction.
; Oblique: At an angle to the direction of flow.
; Bow: Occurs upstream of the front (bow) of a blunt object when the upstream flow velocity exceeds Mach 1.

Some other terms:
* Shock front: The boundary over which the physical conditions undergo an abrupt change because of a shock wave.
* Contact front: In a shock wave caused by a driver gas (for example the &quot;impact&quot; of a high explosive on the surrounding air), the boundary between the driver (explosive products) and the driven (air) gases. The contact front trails the shock front.

== In supersonic flows ==

The abruptness of change in the features of the medium, that characterize shock waves, can be viewed as a phase transition: the pressure–time diagram of a supersonic object propagating shows how the transition induced by a shock wave is analogous to a &quot;dynamic phase transition&quot;.

When an object (or disturbance) moves faster than information can propagate into the surrounding fluid, the fluid near the disturbance cannot react or &quot;get out of the way&quot; before the disturbance arrives. In a shock wave the properties of the fluid (density, pressure, temperature, flow velocity, Mach number) change almost instantaneously. Measurements of the thickness of shock waves in air have resulted in values around 200 nm (about 10−5 in), which is on the same order of magnitude as the mean free path of gas molecules. In reference to the continuum, this implies the shock wave can be treated as either a line or a plane if the flow field is two-dimensional or three-dimensional, respectively.

Shock waves are formed when a pressure front moves at supersonic speeds and pushes on the surrounding air. At the region where this occurs, sound waves travelling against the flow reach a point where they cannot travel any further upstream and the pressure progressively builds in that region; a high-pressure shock wave rapidly forms.

Shock waves are not conventional sound waves; a shock wave takes the form of a very sharp change in the gas properties. Shock waves in air are heard as a loud &quot;crack&quot; or &quot;snap&quot; noise. Over longer distances, a shock wave can change from a nonlinear wave into a linear wave, degenerating into a conventional sound wave as it heats the air and loses energy. The sound wave is heard as the familiar &quot;thud&quot; or &quot;thump&quot; of a sonic boom, commonly created by the supersonic flight of aircraft.

The shock wave is one of several different ways in which a gas in a supersonic flow can be compressed. Some other methods are isentropic compressions, including Prandtl–Meyer compressions. The method of compression of a gas results in different temperatures and densities for a given pressure ratio which can be analytically calculated for a non-reacting gas. A shock wave compression results in a loss of total pressure, meaning that it is a less efficient method of compressing gases for some purposes, for instance in the intake of a scramjet. The appearance of pressure-drag on supersonic aircraft is mostly due to the effect of shock compression on the flow.

== Normal shocks ==
In elementary fluid mechanics utilizing ideal gases, a shock wave is treated as a discontinuity where entropy increases abruptly as the shock passes. Since no fluid flow is discontinuous, a control volume is established around the shock wave, with the control surfaces that bound this volume parallel to the shock wave (with one surface on the pre-shock side of the fluid medium and one on the post-shock side). The two surfaces are separated by a very small depth such that the shock itself is entirely contained between them. At such control surfaces, momentum, mass flux and energy are constant; within combustion, detonations can be modelled as heat introduction across a shock wave. It is assumed the system is adiabatic (no heat exits or enters the system) and no work is being done. The Rankine–Hugoniot conditions arise from these considerations.

Taking into account the established assumptions, in a system where the downstream properties are becoming subsonic: the upstream and downstream flow properties of the fluid are considered isentropic. Since the total amount of energy within the system is constant, the stagnation enthalpy remains constant over both regions. However, entropy is increasing; this must be accounted for by a drop in stagnation pressure of the downstream fluid.

== Other shocks ==

=== Oblique shocks ===
When analyzing shock waves in a flow field, which are still attached to the body, the shock wave which is deviating at some arbitrary angle from the flow direction is termed oblique shock. These shocks require a component vector analysis of the flow; doing so allows for the treatment of the flow in an orthogonal direction to the oblique shock as a normal shock.

=== Bow shocks ===
When an oblique shock is likely to form at an angle which cannot remain on the surface, a nonlinear phenomenon arises where the shock wave will form a continuous pattern around the body. These are termed &quot;bow shocks&quot;. In these cases, the 1d flow model is not valid and further analysis is needed to predict the pressure forces which are exerted on the surface.

== Shock waves due to nonlinear steepening ==
Shock waves can form due to steepening of ordinary waves. The best-known example of this phenomenon is ocean waves that form breakers on the shore. In shallow water, the speed of surface waves is dependent on the depth of the water. An incoming ocean wave has a slightly higher wave speed near the crest of each wave than near the troughs between waves, because the wave height is not infinitesimal compared to the depth of the water. The crests overtake the troughs until the leading edge of the wave forms a vertical face and spills over to form a turbulent shock (a breaker) that dissipates the wave&#x27;s energy as sound and heat.

Similar phenomena affect strong sound waves in gas or plasma, due to the dependence of the sound speed on temperature and pressure. Strong waves heat the medium near each pressure front, due to adiabatic compression of the air itself, so that high pressure fronts outrun the corresponding pressure troughs. There is a theory that the sound pressure levels in brass instruments such as the trombone become high enough for steepening to occur, forming an essential part of the bright timbre of the instruments. While shock formation by this process does not normally happen to unenclosed sound waves in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, it is thought to be one mechanism by which the solar chromosphere and corona are heated, via waves that propagate up from the solar interior.

== Analogies ==
A shock wave may be described as the furthest point upstream of a moving object which &quot;knows&quot; about the approach of the object. In this description, the shock wave position is defined as the boundary between the zone having no information about the shock-driving event and the zone aware of the shock-driving event, analogous with the light cone described in the theory of special relativity.

To produce a shock wave, an object in a given medium (such as air or water) must travel faster than the local speed of sound. In the case of an aircraft travelling at high subsonic speed, regions of air around the aircraft may be travelling at exactly the speed of sound, so that the sound waves leaving the aircraft pile up on one another, similar to a traffic jam on a motorway. When a shock wave forms, the local air pressure increases and then spreads out sideways. Because of this amplification effect, a shock wave can be very intense, more like an explosion when heard at a distance (not coincidentally, since explosions create shock waves).

Analogous phenomena are known outside fluid mechanics. For example, charged particles accelerated beyond the speed of light in a refractive medium (such as water, where the speed of light is less than that in a vacuum) create visible shock effects, a phenomenon known as Cherenkov radiation.

== Phenomenon types ==
Below are a number of examples of shock waves, broadly grouped with similar shock phenomena:

=== Moving shock ===
* Usually consists of a shock wave propagating into a stationary medium
* In this case, the gas ahead of the shock is stationary (in the laboratory frame) and the gas behind the shock can be supersonic in the laboratory frame. The shock propagates with a wavefront which is normal (at right angles) to the direction of flow. The speed of the shock is a function of the original pressure ratio between the two bodies of gas.
* Moving shocks are usually generated by the interaction of two bodies of gas at different pressure, with a shock wave propagating into the lower pressure gas and an expansion wave propagating into the higher pressure gas.
* Examples: Balloon bursting, shock tube, shock wave from explosion.

=== Detonation wave ===

* A detonation wave is essentially a shock supported by a trailing exothermic reaction. It involves a wave travelling through a highly combustible or chemically unstable medium, such as an oxygen-methane mixture or a high explosive. The chemical reaction of the medium occurs following the shock wave, and the chemical energy of the reaction drives the wave forward.
* A detonation wave follows slightly different rules from an ordinary shock since it is driven by the chemical reaction occurring behind the shock wavefront. In the simplest theory for detonations, an unsupported, self-propagating detonation wave proceeds at the Chapman–Jouguet flow velocity. A detonation will also cause a shock to propagate into the surrounding air due to the overpressure induced by the explosion.
* When a shock wave is created by high explosives such as TNT (which has a detonation velocity of 6,900 m/s), it will always travel at high, supersonic velocity from its point of origin.


=== Bow shock (detached shock) ===

* These shocks are curved and form a small distance in front of the body. Directly in front of the body, they stand at 90 degrees to the oncoming flow and then curve around the body. Detached shocks allow the same type of analytic calculations as for the attached shock, for the flow near the shock. They are a topic of continuing interest, because the rules governing the shock&#x27;s distance ahead of the blunt body are complicated and are a function of the body&#x27;s shape. Additionally, the shock standoff distance varies drastically with the temperature for a non-ideal gas, causing large differences in the heat transfer to the thermal protection system of the vehicle. See the extended discussion on this topic at atmospheric reentry. These follow the &quot;strong-shock&quot; solutions of the analytic equations, meaning that for some oblique shocks very close to the deflection angle limit, the downstream Mach number is subsonic. See also bow shock or oblique shock.
* Such a shock occurs when the maximum deflection angle is exceeded. A detached shock is commonly seen on blunt bodies, but may also be seen on sharp bodies at low Mach numbers.
* Examples: Space return vehicles (Apollo, Space shuttle), bullets, the boundary (bow shock) of a magnetosphere. The name &quot;bow shock&quot; comes from the example of a bow wave, the detached shock formed at the bow (front) of a ship or boat moving through water, whose slow surface wave speed is easily exceeded (see ocean surface wave).

=== Attached shock ===
* These shocks appear as &quot;attached&quot; to the tip of sharp bodies moving at supersonic speeds.
* Examples: Supersonic wedges and cones with small apex angles.
* The attached shock wave is a classic structure in aerodynamics because, for a perfect gas and inviscid flow field, an analytic solution is available, such that the pressure ratio, temperature ratio, angle of the wedge and the downstream Mach number can all be calculated knowing the upstream Mach number and the shock angle. Smaller shock angles are associated with higher upstream Mach numbers, and the special case where the shock wave is at 90° to the oncoming flow (Normal shock), is associated with a Mach number of one. These follow the &quot;weak-shock&quot; solutions of the analytic equations.

=== In rapid granular flows ===
Shock waves can also occur in rapid flows of dense granular materials down inclined channels or slopes. Strong shocks in rapid dense granular flows can be studied theoretically and analyzed to compare with experimental data. Consider a configuration in which the rapidly moving material down the chute impinges on an obstruction wall erected perpendicular at the end of a long and steep channel. Impact leads to a sudden change in the flow regime from a fast moving supercritical thin layer to a stagnant thick heap. This flow configuration is particularly interesting because it is analogous to some hydraulic and aerodynamic situations associated with flow regime changes from supercritical to subcritical flows.

=== In astrophysics ===

Astrophysical environments feature many different types of shock waves. Some common examples are supernovae shock waves or blast waves travelling through the interstellar medium, the bow shock caused by the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field colliding with the solar wind and shock waves caused by galaxies colliding with each other. Another interesting type of shock in astrophysics is the quasi-steady reverse shock or termination shock that terminates the ultra relativistic wind from young pulsars.

==== Meteor entering events ====
Shock waves are generated by meteoroids when they enter the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The Tunguska event and the 2013 Russian meteor event are the best documented evidence of the shock wave produced by a massive meteoroid.

When the 2013 meteor entered into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere with an energy release equivalent to 100 or more kilotons of TNT, dozens of times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, the meteor&#x27;s shock wave produced damage as in a supersonic jet&#x27;s flyby (directly underneath the meteor&#x27;s path) and as a detonation wave, with the circular shock wave centred at the meteor explosion, causing multiple instances of broken glass in the city of Chelyabinsk and neighbouring areas (pictured).

== Technological applications==
In the examples below, the shock wave is controlled, produced by (ex. airfoil) or in the interior of a technological device, like a turbine.

=== Recompression shock ===

* These shocks appear when the flow over a transonic body is decelerated to subsonic speeds.
* Examples: Transonic wings, turbines
* Where the flow over the suction side of a transonic wing is accelerated to a supersonic speed, the resulting re-compression can be by either Prandtl–Meyer compression or by the formation of a normal shock. This shock is of particular interest to makers of transonic devices because it can cause separation of the boundary layer at the point where it touches the transonic profile. This can then lead to full separation and stall on the profile, higher drag, or shock-buffet, a condition where the separation and the shock interact in a resonance condition, causing resonating loads on the underlying structure.

=== Pipe flow ===
* This shock appears when supersonic flow in a pipe is decelerated.
* Examples:
** In supersonic propulsion: ramjet, scramjet, unstart.
** In flow control: needle valve, choked venturi.
* In this case the gas ahead of the shock is supersonic (in the laboratory frame), and the gas behind the shock system is either supersonic (&quot;oblique shock&quot;s) or subsonic (a &quot;normal shock&quot;) (Although for some oblique shocks very close to the deflection angle limit, the downstream Mach number is subsonic.) The shock is the result of the deceleration of the gas by a converging duct, or by the growth of the boundary layer on the wall of a parallel duct.

=== Combustion engines===
The wave disk engine (also named &quot;Radial Internal Combustion Wave Rotor&quot;) is a kind of pistonless rotary engine that utilizes &quot;shock waves&quot; to transfer energy between a high-energy fluid to a low-energy fluid, thereby increasing both temperature and pressure of the low-energy fluid.

=== Memristors ===
In memristors, under externally-applied electric field, shock waves can be launched across the transition-metal oxides, creating fast and non-volatile resistivity changes.

== Shock capturing and detection ==

Advanced techniques are needed to capture shock waves and to detect shock waves in both numerical computations and experimental observations.

Computational fluid dynamics is commonly used to obtain the flow field with shock waves. Though shock waves are sharp discontinuities, in numerical solutions of fluid flow with discontinuities (shock wave, contact discontinuity or slip line), the shock wave can be smoothed out by low-order numerical method (due to numerical dissipation) or there are spurious oscillations near shock surface by high-order numerical method (due to Gibbs phenomena).

There exist some other discontinuities in fluid flow than the shock wave. The slip surface (3D) or slip line (2D) is a plane across which the tangent velocity is discontinuous, while pressure and normal velocity are continuous. Across the contact discontinuity, the pressure and velocity are continuous and the density is discontinuous. A strong expansion wave or shear layer may also contain high gradient regions which appear to be a discontinuity. Some common features of these flow structures and shock waves and the insufficient aspects of numerical and experimental tools lead to two important problems in practices:
(1) some shock waves can not be detected or their positions are detected wrong, (2) some flow structures which are not shock waves are wrongly detected to be shock waves.

In fact, correct capturing and detection of shock waves are important since shock waves have the following influences: 
(1) causing loss of total pressure, which may be a concern related to scramjet engine performance, 
(2) providing lift for wave-rider configuration, as the oblique shock wave at lower surface of the vehicle can produce high pressure to generate lift, 
(3) leading to wave drag of high-speed vehicle which is harmful to vehicle performance,
(4) inducing severe pressure load and heat flux, e.g. the Type IV shock–shock interference could yield a 17 times heating increase at vehicle surface, (5) interacting with other structures, such as boundary layers, to produce new flow structures such as flow separation, transition, etc.

<text>Upside was a San Francisco-based business and technology magazine for venture capitalists. It was published from 1989 to 2002. It had a circulation above 300,000.

==History==
===Beginnings===
&quot;Upside&quot; was started by banker Anthony B. Perkins and technical writer Rich Karlgaard as a magazine &quot;for Silicon Valley about Silicon Valley.&quot; Venture capitalist Tim Draper was the main initial backer, along with Silicon Valley Bank founder Roger Smith and Estée Lauder&#x27;s grandson Gary Lauder. Jay Whitehead was its Managing Publisher. In its early issues, the publication published controversial articles on investment firms Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers and Hambrecht &amp; Quist. &quot;Upside&quot; quickly became widely read in the Silicon Valley tech community but burned through $3 million between 1989 and 1992 and was constantly trying to raise money.

===Departure of founders===
Perkins was removed by the magazine&#x27;s board of directors as publisher on May 2, 1992. He would go on to start &quot;Red Herring&quot;, which had a similar focus to &quot;Upside&quot;. Within a month, Karlgaard left to become editor of &quot;Forbes ASAP&quot;. &quot;Forbes ASAP&quot; was originally announced as a joint venture between &quot;Forbes&quot; and &quot;Upside&quot;, but &quot;Upside&quot; was excluded from the venture after the hiring of Karlgaard, and this angered magazine staff.

David Bunnell, an &quot;Upside&quot; board member and investor and a founder of &quot;PC World&quot;, &quot;Macworld&quot; and &quot;PC Magazine&quot;, was CEO from 1996–2002.

===Expansion===
In 1997, The Washington Post Company invested in &quot;Upside&quot; and announced the two companies would share editorial resources, collaborate online, sponsor conferences together and cooperate on ad sales and circulation development. The Washington Post Company said it selected &quot;Upside&quot; due to the magazine&#x27;s tech news and connections in Silicon Valley.

David Bunnell&#x27;s son Aaron Bunnell joined &quot;Upside&quot; as a vice president in the late 1990s, in charge of the magazine&#x27;s website UpsideToday. He struck a crucial deal with Yahoo that doubled traffic and launched a popular feature called &quot;Dot-Com graveyard.&quot; Co-workers described him as a hard worker. In summer 2000, he was found dead in a hotel room in New York, where he had traveled to close an UpsideToday business deal. He had reportedly been using drugs, working long hours and grieving the loss of a girlfriend in the weeks leading up to his death.

In January 2001, &quot;Upside&quot; launched UpsideFN, a New York-based online radio network headed by GM Scott Hunter and J.T. Farley, a former senior producer and news editor for CNBC. UpsideFN closed in May 2001, citing a weak advertising market.

At its peak size in 2001, &quot;Upside&quot; employed 110 staff.

===Bankruptcy===
&quot;Upside&quot; declared bankruptcy and ceased publication in 2002.

<text>Martin v. Hunter&#x27;s Lessee, 14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 304 (1816), was a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States decided on March 20, 1816. It was the first case to assert ultimate Supreme Court authority over state courts in civil matters of federal law.

Though Chief Justice John Marshall wrote most of the Supreme Court opinions during his tenure, he did not write this opinion. Marshall instead recused himself, citing a conflict of interest due to his relatives&#x27; interest in the property. Justice Joseph Story wrote the decision for a unanimous court.

==Facts==
During the American Revolution, the Commonwealth of Virginia enacted legislation that allowed it to confiscate Loyalists&#x27; property. Land owned by a loyalist, Martin, part of the Northern Neck Property, was confiscated by the State and transferred to David Hunter. The Treaty of Paris (1783) between Great Britain and the United States nullified such confiscations, permitting Martin to sue for the return of the property. The trial court ruled in his favor, but the Virginia Supreme Court upheld the confiscation. The court did not rule that Virginia law was superior to U.S. treaties, but held that the treaty did not cover the dispute in question. On review in &quot;Fairfax&#x27;s Devisee v. Hunter&#x27;s Lessee&quot;, 11 U.S. 603 (1813), the U.S. Supreme Court disagreed with this conclusion, ruling that the treaty did in fact cover the dispute, and remanded the case back to the Virginia Supreme Court. The Virginia court in turn decided that the U.S. Supreme Court did not have authority over cases originating in state court:

The Court is unanimously of opinion, that the appellate power of the Supreme Court of the United States does not extend to this Court, under a sound construction of the Constitution of the United States; that so much of the 25th section of the act of Congress to establish the judicial courts of the United States, as extends the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to this Court, is not in pursuance of the Constitution of the United States; that the writ of error in this cause was improvidently allowed under the authority of that act; that the proceedings thereon in the Supreme Court were coram non judice in relation to this Court, and that obedience to its mandate be declined by the Court.

The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the state court&#x27;s decision on appeal, ruling that questions of federal law were within its jurisdiction, and thereby establishing its own supremacy in matters of constitutional interpretation.

Though Chief Justice John Marshall wrote most of the Supreme Court opinions during his tenure, he did not write this opinion. Marshall instead recused himself, citing a conflict of interest due to his relatives&#x27; interest in the property. Justice Joseph Story wrote the decision for a unanimous court.

==Judgment==
Story first confronted the argument that federal judicial power came from the states, and therefore that the Supreme Court had no right to overrule a state&#x27;s interpretation of the treaty without its consent. Story found that it was clear from history and the preamble of the Constitution that the federal power was given directly by the people and not by the states.

Story then cited Article III, Section 2, Clause 2, showing a textual commitment to allow Supreme Court judicial review of state decisions:

If the Supreme Court could not review the decisions of the highest state court, state courts would be excluded from ever hearing a case involving a federal question. Thus, because it was established that the states had the power to rule on federal issues it must be true that the Supreme Court can review the decision, or the Supreme Court would not have appellate jurisdiction in &quot;all other cases&quot; as stated by the Constitution.

Furthermore, the Supremacy Clause declares that federal interpretation trumps the state&#x27;s interpretation. Story rejected concerns over State judicial sovereignty. Under Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution specific limits are placed upon the &quot;sovereignty&quot; of state governments. The Supreme Court could already review state executive and legislative decisions and this case was no different.

Story then confronted the argument that state judges were bound to uphold the Constitution just as federal judges were, and so denying state interpretations presumed that the state judges would less than faithfully interpret the Constitution. Story countered that even if state judges were not biased, the issue was not bias but uniformity in federal law. Furthermore, the legislative power to remove a case to federal court would be inadequate for maintaining this uniformity. Finally, Story applied these principles of judicial review to the decisions below and found that the state court&#x27;s decision was in error.

Story said the following in his judgment:

The vote tally was 6 to 0, with Johnson giving a concurring opinion.

<doc id="146262" wikidata="Q17022036" url="?curid=146262" title="Milliken v. Bradley">
<text>Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717 (1974), was a significant United States Supreme Court case dealing with the planned desegregation busing of public school students across district lines among 53 school districts in metropolitan Detroit. It concerned the plans to integrate public schools in the United States following the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) decision.

The ruling clarified the distinction between &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot; segregation, confirming that segregation was allowed if it was not considered an explicit policy of each school district. In particular, the Court held that the school systems were not responsible for desegregation across district lines unless it could be shown that they had each deliberately engaged in a policy of segregation. The case did not expand on &quot;Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education&quot; (1971), the first major Supreme Court case concerning school busing.

==Background==

===Educational segregation in the U.S.===
&quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; was a landmark desegregation ruling, but difficult to implement. The case also did not take into account many sources of segregation in the US, including an ongoing migration of Black people into cities, white flight to the suburbs, and policies and practices that barred non-whites from suburban housing. By the 1970s, many urban school districts had super-majorities of black students. Educational segregation was therefore widespread, with informal racial barriers in the form of numerous thinly disguised practices that opposed Black people living in suburbs.

===Detroit===
Detroit is one of the most segregated cities in the United States. During the Great Migration, the city gained a large black population, which was excluded upon arrival from white neighborhoods. This exclusion was enforced by economic discrimination (redlining), exclusionary clauses in property deeds, as well as violence (destruction of property including arson and bombings, as well as assault). Some of the discriminatory policies in Detroit ended as public awareness increased and became more sensitive to the national civil rights movement, which began after World War II, and as black voting power in city precincts increased. The changes allowed Black people to move into additional neighborhoods in the City, but some neighborhoods resisted and for the most part little or no change of segregative practices occurred in the suburbs.

By the mid-70s, more than two-thirds of students in the Detroit school system were black.

===Procedural history===
On August 18, 1970, the NAACP filed suit against Michigan state officials, including Governor William Milliken. The original trial began on April 6, 1971, and lasted for 41 days. The NAACP argued that although schools were not officially segregated (white only), the city of Detroit and the State as represented by its surrounding counties had enacted policies to increase racial segregation in schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices (such as redlining) and educational segregation.
District Judge Stephen J. Roth initially denied the plaintiffs&#x27; motion for a preliminary injunction.

The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the &quot;implementation of the April 7 plan was [unconstitutionally] thwarted by State action in the form of the Act of the Legislature of Michigan&quot; and remanded the case for an expedited trial on the merits.

On remand to the District Court, Judge Roth held the State of Michigan and the school districts accountable for the segregation, and ordered the implementation of a desegregation plan.

The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed some of the decision, specifically the official segregation that had been practiced by the City&#x27;s school district, but withheld judgment on the relationship of housing segregation with education. The Court specified that it was the state&#x27;s responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area.

The accused officials appealed to the Supreme Court, which took up the case on February 27, 1974.

==Decision of the Court==
The Supreme Court overturned the lower courts in a 5-to-4 decision, holding that school districts were not obligated to desegregate unless it had been proven that the lines were drawn with racist intent on the part of the districts. Thus, superficially arbitrary lines drawn by State agencies which produced segregated districts were not illegal.

The Court held that &quot;[w]ith no showing of significant violation by the 53 outlying school districts and no evidence of any interdistrict violation or effect,&quot; the district court&#x27;s remedy was &quot;wholly impermissible&quot; and not justified by &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. The Court noted that desegregation, &quot;in the sense of dismantling a dual school system,&quot; did not require &quot;any particular racial balance in each &#x27;school, grade or classroom.&#x27;&quot; The Court agreed that the Constitutional rights of Black people had been violated by the City&#x27; school district; the segregative results involving suburban districts did not make suburban districts nor the State of Michigan responsible.

The Court also emphasized the importance of local control over the operation of schools.

===Dissents===
Justice Thurgood Marshall&#x27;s dissenting opinion stated that:

School district lines, however innocently drawn, will surely be perceived as fences to separate the races when, under a Detroit-only decree, white parents withdraw their children from the Detroit city schools and move to the suburbs in order to continue them in all-white schools.

Justice William O. Douglas&#x27;s dissenting opinion stated that:

Today&#x27;s decision ... means that there is no violation of the Equal Protection Clause though the schools are segregated by race and though the black schools are not only &quot;separate&quot; but &quot;inferior.&quot;... Michigan by one device or another has over the years created black school districts and white school districts, the task of equity is to provide a unitary system for the affected area where, as here, the State washes its hands of its own creations.

==Impact of the case==
The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision required the City of Detroit&#x27;s school district to redistribute the relatively small number of white students more widely across the district. According to Wayne State professor John Mogk, the decision also enabled the white flight that re-entrenched the city&#x27;s segregation. The Detroit Public Schools became even more disproportionately black over the next two decades (with 90% black students in 1987).

This result reaffirmed the national pattern of city schools attended mostly by Black people, with surrounding suburban schools mostly attended by Whites.

<doc id="146263" wikidata="Q1153584" url="?curid=146263" title="Monotone convergence theorem">
<text>In the mathematical field of real analysis, the monotone convergence theorem is any of a number of related theorems proving the good convergence behaviour of monotonic sequences, i.e. sequences that are non-increasing, or non-decreasing. In its simplest form, it says that a non-decreasing bounded-above sequence of real numbers formula_1 converges to its smallest upper bound, its supremum. Likewise, a non-increasing bounded-below sequence converges to its largest lower bound, its infimum. In particular, infinite sums of non-negative numbers converge to the supremum of the partial sums if and only if the partial sums are bounded.

For sums of non-negative increasing sequences formula_2, it says that taking the sum and the supremum can be interchanged.

In more advanced mathematics the monotone convergence theorem usually refers to a fundamental result in measure theory due to Lebesgue and Beppo Levi that says that for sequences of non-negative pointwise-increasing measurable functions formula_3, taking the integral and the supremum can be interchanged with the result being finite if either one is finite.

==Convergence of a monotone sequence of real numbers==

Every bounded-above monotonically nondecreasing sequence of real numbers is convergent in the real numbers because the supremum exists and is a real number. The proposition does not apply to rational numbers because the supremum of a sequence of rational numbers may be irrational.

===Proposition===
(A) For a non-decreasing and bounded-above sequence of real numbers 
:formula_4 
the limit formula_5 exists and equals its supremum:
:formula_6

(B) For a non-increasing and bounded-below sequence of real numbers 
:formula_7
the limit formula_8 exists and equals its infimum:
:formula_9.

===Proof===
Let formula_10 be the set of values of formula_11. By assumption, formula_12 is non-empty and bounded above by formula_13. By the least-upper-bound property of real numbers, formula_14 exists and formula_15. Now, for every formula_16, there exists formula_17 such that formula_18, since otherwise formula_19 is a strictly smaller upper bound of formula_12, contradicting the definition of the supremum formula_21. Then since formula_22 is non decreasing, and formula_21 is an upper bound, for every formula_24, we have 
:formula_25
Hence, by definition formula_26.

The proof of the (B) part is analogous or follows from (A) by considering formula_27.

===Theorem===
If formula_22 is a monotone sequence of real numbers, i.e., if formula_29 for every formula_30 or formula_31 for every formula_30, then this sequence has a finite limit if and only if the sequence is bounded.

===Proof===
* &quot;If&quot;-direction: The proof follows directly from the proposition.
* &quot;Only If&quot;-direction: By (ε, δ)-definition of limit, every sequence formula_22 with a finite limit formula_34 is necessarily bounded.

==Convergence of a monotone series==

There is a variant of the proposition above where we allow unbounded sequences in the extended real numbers, the real numbers with formula_35 and formula_36 added. 
:formula_37
In the extended real numbers every set has a supremum (resp. infimum) which of course may be formula_35 (resp. formula_39) if the set is unbounded. An important use of the extended reals is that any set of non negative numbers formula_40 has a well defined summation order independent sum 
:formula_41
where formula_42 are the upper extended non negative real numbers. For a series of non negative numbers 
:formula_43
so this sum coincides with the sum of a series if both are defined. In particular the sum of a series of non negative numbers does not depend on the order of summation.

==Monotone convergence of non negative sums==
Let formula_44 be a sequence of non-negative real numbers indexed by natural numbers formula_45 and formula_46. Suppose that formula_47 for all formula_48. Then
:formula_49

===Proof===

Since formula_50 we have formula_51 so formula_52.

Conversely, we can interchange sup and sum for finite sums by reverting to the limit definition, so
formula_53 hence formula_54.

===Examples===

====Matrices====

The theorem states that if you have an infinite matrix of non-negative real numbers formula_55 such that the rows are weakly increasing and each is bounded formula_56 where the bounds are summable formula_57 then, for each column, the non decreasing column sums formula_58 are bounded hence convergent, and the limit of the column sums is equal to the sum of the &quot;limit column&quot; formula_59 which element wise is the supremum over the row.

====&quot;e&quot;====

Consider the expansion
:formula_60
Now set 
:formula_61
for formula_62 and formula_63 for formula_64, then formula_65 with formula_66 and 
:formula_67. 
The right hand side is a non decreasing sequence in formula_46, therefore
:formula_69.

==Beppo Levi&#x27;s lemma==
The following result is a generalisation of the monotone convergence of non negative sums theorem above to the measure theoretic setting. It is a cornerstone of measure and integration theory with many applications and has Fatou&#x27;s lemma and the dominated convergence theorem as direct consequence. It is due to Beppo Levi, who proved a slight generalization in 1906 of an earlier result by Henri Lebesgue.

Let formula_70 denotes the formula_71-algebra of Borel sets on the upper extended non negative real numbers formula_72. By definition, formula_70 contains the set formula_74 and all Borel subsets of formula_75

===Theorem (monotone convergence theorem for non-negative measurable functions)===
Let formula_76 be a measure space, and formula_77 a measurable set. Let formula_78 be a pointwise non-decreasing sequence of formula_79-measurable non-negative functions, i.e. each function formula_80 is formula_79-measurable and for every formula_82 and every formula_83,

:formula_84

Then the pointwise supremum
:formula_85
is a formula_79-measurable function and

:formula_87

Remark 1. The integrals and the suprema may be finite or infinite, but the left-hand side is finite if and only if the right-hand side is.

Remark 2. Under the assumptions of the theorem,
Note that the second chain of equalities follows from monoticity of the integral (lemma 2 below). Thus we can also write the conclusion of the theorem as

:formula_88
with the tacit understanding that the limits are allowed to be infinite.

Remark 3. The theorem remains true if its assumptions hold formula_89-almost everywhere. In other words, it is enough that there is a null set formula_17 such that the sequence formula_91 non-decreases for every formula_92 To see why this is true, we start with an observation that allowing the sequence formula_93 to pointwise non-decrease almost everywhere causes its pointwise limit formula_94 to be undefined on some null set formula_17. On that null set, formula_94 may then be defined arbitrarily, e.g. as zero, or in any other way that preserves measurability. To see why this will not affect the outcome of the theorem, note that since formula_97 we have, for every formula_98

:formula_99 and formula_100

provided that formula_94 is formula_102-measurable. (These equalities follow directly from the definition of the Lebesgue integral for a non-negative function).

Remark 4. The proof below does not use any properties of the Lebesgue integral except those established here. The theorem, thus, can be used to prove other basic properties, such as linearity, pertaining to Lebesgue integration.

===Proof===

This proof does &quot;not&quot; rely on Fatou&#x27;s lemma; however, we do explain how that lemma might be used. Those not interested in this independency of the proof may skip the intermediate results below.

====Intermediate results====

We need three basic lemmas. In the proof below, we apply the monotonic property of the Lebesgue integral to non-negative functions only. Specifically (see Remark 4),

====Monotonicity of the Lebesgue integral====
lemma 1. let the functions formula_103 be formula_79-measurable.

*If formula_105 everywhere on formula_106 then

:formula_107

*If formula_108 and formula_109 then

:formula_110

Proof. Denote by formula_111 the set of simple formula_112-measurable functions formula_113 such that
formula_114 everywhere on formula_115

1. Since formula_116 we have
formula_117 hence
:formula_118

2. The functions formula_119 where formula_120 is the indicator function of formula_121, are easily seen to be measurable and formula_122. Now apply 1.

=====Lebesgue integral as measure=====
Lemma 2. Let formula_76 be a measurable space. Consider a simple formula_102-measurable non-negative function formula_125. For a measurable subset formula_126, define
:formula_127
Then formula_128 is a measure on formula_129.

====Proof (lemma 2)====
Write 
formula_130
with formula_131 and measurable sets formula_132. Then 
:formula_133
Since finite positive linear combinations of countably additive set functions are countably additive, to prove countable additivity of formula_128 it suffices to prove that, the set function defined by formula_135 is countably additive for all formula_136. But this follows directly from the countable additivity of formula_89.

=====Continuity from below=====

Lemma 3. Let formula_89 be a measure, and formula_139, where
:formula_140
is a non-decreasing chain with all its sets formula_89-measurable. Then
:formula_142

====proof (lemma 3)====
Set formula_143, then 
we decompose formula_144 as a countable disjoint union of measurable sets and likewise formula_145 as a finite disjoint union. Therefore
formula_146, and formula_147 so formula_148.

==Proof of theorem==
Set formula_149.
Denote by formula_150 the set of simple formula_102-measurable functions formula_113 such that formula_153 on formula_154.

Step 1. The function formula_94 is formula_156–measurable, and the integral formula_157 is well-defined (albeit possibly infinite)

From formula_158 we get formula_159. Hence we have to show that formula_94 is formula_79-measurable. To see this, it suffices to prove that formula_162 is formula_163-measurable for all formula_164, because the intervals formula_165 generate the Borel sigma algebra on the extended non negative reals formula_166 by complementing and taking countable intersections, complements and countable unions.

Now since the formula_167 is a non decreasing sequence, 
formula_168 if and only if formula_169 for all formula_46. Since we already know that formula_171 and formula_172 we conclude that
:formula_173
Hence formula_174 is a measurable set, 
being the countable intersection of the measurable sets formula_175.

Since formula_176 the integral is well defined (but possibly infinite) as 
:formula_177.

Step 2. We have the inequality

:formula_178

This is equivalent to formula_179 for all formula_46 which follows directly from formula_181 and &quot;monotonicity of the integral&quot; (lemma 1).

step 3 We have the reverse inequality

:formula_182.

By the definition of integral as a supremum step 3 is equivalent to 
:formula_183
for every formula_184. 
It is tempting to prove formula_185 for formula_186 sufficiently large, but this does not work e.g. if formula_187 is itself simple and the formula_188. However, we can get ourself an &quot;epsilon of room&quot; to manoeuvre and avoid this problem. 
Step 3 is also equivalent to 
:formula_189
for every simple function formula_184 and every formula_191
where for the equality we used that the left hand side of the inequality is a finite sum. This we will prove.

Given formula_184 and formula_191, define
:formula_194

We claim the sets formula_195 have the following properties: 
#formula_195 is formula_197-measurable. 
# formula_198
#formula_199

Assuming the claim, by the definition of formula_195 and &quot;monotonicity of the Lebesgue integral&quot; (lemma 1) we have
:formula_201 
Hence by &quot;Lebesgue integral of a simple function as measure&quot; (lemma 2), and &quot;continuity from below&quot; (lemma 3) we get:
:formula_202
which we set out to prove. Thus it remains to prove the claim.
Ad 1: Write formula_203, for non-negative constants formula_204, and measurable sets formula_205, which we may assume are pairwise disjoint and with union formula_206. Then for formula_207 we have formula_208 if and only if formula_209 so 
:formula_210
which is measurable since the formula_211 are measurable.

Ad 2: For formula_212 we have formula_213 so formula_214

Ad 3: Fix formula_215. If formula_216 then formula_217, hence formula_218. Otherwise, formula_219 and formula_220 so formula_221 for formula_222
sufficiently large, hence formula_223.

The proof of the monotone convergence theorem is complete.

===Relaxing the monotonicity assumption===
Under similar hypotheses to Beppo Levi&#x27;s theorem, it is possible to relax the hypothesis of monotonicity. As before, let formula_224 be a measure space and formula_225. Again, formula_226 will be a sequence of formula_227-measurable non-negative functions formula_80. However, we do not assume they are pointwise non-decreasing. Instead, we assume that formula_229 converges for almost every formula_230, we define formula_94 to be the pointwise limit of formula_226, and we assume additionally that formula_233 pointwise almost everywhere for all formula_46. Then formula_94 is formula_227-measurable, and formula_237 exists, and formula_238

==Proof based on Fatou&#x27;s lemma==
The proof can also be based on Fatou&#x27;s lemma instead of a direct proof as above, because Fatou&#x27;s lemma can be proved independent of the monotone convergence theorem. 
However the monotone convergence theorem is in some ways more primitive than Fatou&#x27;s lemma. It easily follows from the monotone convergence theorem and proof of Fatou&#x27;s lemma is similar and arguably slightly less natural than the proof above.

As before, measurability follows from the fact that formula_239 almost everywhere. The interchange of limits and integrals is then an easy consequence of Fatou&#x27;s lemma. One has formula_240 by Fatou&#x27;s lemma, and then, since formula_241 (monotonicity), 
formula_242 Therefore 
formula_243

<doc id="146264" wikidata="Q5124539" url="?curid=146264" title="Civil Rights Cases">
<text>The Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3 (1883), were a group of five landmark cases in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments did not empower Congress to outlaw racial discrimination by private individuals. The holding that the Thirteenth Amendment did not empower the federal government to punish racist acts done by private citizens would be overturned by the Supreme Court in the 1968 case &quot;Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.&quot; The Fourteenth Amendment not applying to private entities, however, is still valid precedent to this day. Although the Fourteenth Amendment-related decision has never been overturned, in the 1964 case of &quot;Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States&quot;, the Supreme Court held that Congress could prohibit racial discrimination by private actors under the Commerce Clause, though that and other loose interpretations of the Clause to expand federal power have been subject to criticism.

During Reconstruction, Congress had passed the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which entitled everyone to access accommodation, public transport, and theaters regardless of race or color. In his majority opinion in the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot;, Associate Justice Joseph P. Bradley struck down the Civil Rights Act of 1875, holding that the Thirteenth Amendment &quot;merely abolishes slavery&quot; and that the Fourteenth Amendment did not give Congress the power to outlaw private acts of racial discrimination. Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan was the lone dissenter in the case, writing that the &quot;substance and spirit of the recent amendments of the constitution have been sacrificed by a subtle and ingenious verbal criticism.&quot; The decision ushered in the widespread segregation of blacks in housing, employment, and public life that confined them to second-class citizenship throughout much of the United States until the passage of civil rights legislation in the 1960s.

==Background==
Black American plaintiffs, in five cases from lower courts, sued theaters, hotels, and transit companies that refused to admit them, or had excluded them from &quot;white only&quot; facilities. The Civil Rights Act of 1875 had been passed by Congress and entitled everyone to access accommodation, public transport, and theaters regardless of race or color. This followed the American Civil War (1860–1865), President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Emancipation Proclamation (1 January 1863) to end slavery, and the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution (9 July 1868), which reads, &quot;No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.&quot; To implement the principles in the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress had specified that people could not be discriminated against on grounds of race or color in access to services offered to the general public. The business owners contended that the Civil Rights Act of 1875 was itself unconstitutional, and an Act of Congress should not be able to interfere with their private rights of property.

At the Supreme Court level, the five originally independent cases – &quot;United States v. Stanley&quot;, &quot;United States v. Ryan&quot;, &quot;United States v. Nichols&quot;, &quot;United States v. Singleton&quot;, and &quot;Robinson et ux. v. Memphis &amp; Charleston R.R. Co.&quot; – were consolidated for issuing a single judgment.

==Judgment==
The Supreme Court, in an 8–1 decision by Justice Joseph P. Bradley, held that the language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibited denial of equal protection by a state, did not give Congress power to regulate these private acts, because it was the result of conduct by private individuals, not state law or action, that black people were suffering. Section five empowers Congress only to enforce the prohibition on state action. Legislation by Congress on subjects which are within the domain of the state were, apparently, not authorized by the Fourteenth Amendment. Private acts of racial discrimination were simply private wrongs that the national government was powerless to correct.

Bradley said the following, holding the Constitution did &quot;not authorize Congress to create a code of municipal law for the regulation of private rights,&quot; as distinct from &quot;state&quot; laws. In effect, only state bodies were sufficiently &quot;public&quot; so as to be regulated.
... individual invasion of individual rights is not the subject-matter of the [Fourteenth] Amendment. It has a deeper and broader scope. It nullifies and makes void all state legislation, and state action of every kind, which impairs the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, or which injures them in life, liberty or property without due process of law, or which denies to any of them the equal protection of the laws. ...

It does not invest congress with power to legislate upon subjects which are within the domain of state legislation; but to provide modes of relief against state legislation, or state action, of the kind referred to. It does not authorize congress to create a code of municipal law for the regulation of private rights; but to provide modes of redress against the operation of state laws, and the action of state officers, executive or judicial, when these are subversive of the fundamental rights specified in the amendment. Positive rights and privileges are undoubtedly secured by the fourteenth amendment; but they are secured by way of prohibition against state laws and state proceedings affecting those rights and privileges, and by power given to congress to legislate for the purpose of carrying such prohibition into effect; and such legislation must necessarily be predicated upon such supposed state laws or state proceedings, and be directed to the correction of their operation and effect. A quite full discussion of this aspect of the amendment may be found in &quot;U. S. v. Cruikshank&quot;, 92 U. S. 542; &quot;Virginia v. Rives&quot;, 100 U. S. 313, and &quot;Ex parte Virginia&quot;, Id. 339.

... it would be running the slavery argument into the ground to make it apply to every act of discrimination which a person may see fit to make as to guests he will entertain, or as to the people he will take into his coach or cab or car; or admit to his concert or theater, or deal with in other matters of intercourse or business. Innkeepers and public carriers, by the laws of all the states, so far as we are aware, are bound, to the extent of their facilities, to furnish proper accommodation to all unobjectionable persons who in good faith apply for them. If the laws themselves make any unjust discrimination, amenable to the prohibitions of the fourteenth amendment, congress has full power to afford a remedy under that amendment and in accordance with it.

When a man has emerged from slavery, and by the aid of beneficent legislation has shaken off the inseparable concomitants of that state, there must be some stage in the progress of his elevation when he takes the rank of a mere citizen, and ceases to be the special favorite of the laws, and when his rights as a citizen, or a man, are to be protected in the ordinary modes by which other men&#x27;s rights are protected. There were thousands of free colored people in this country before the abolition of slavery, enjoying all the essential rights of life, liberty, and property the same as white citizens; yet no one, at that time, thought that it was any invasion of their personal status as freemen because they were not admitted to all the privileges enjoyed by white citizens, or because they were subjected to discriminations in the enjoyment of accommodations in inns, public conveyances, and places of amusement. Mere discriminations on account of race or color were not regarded as badges of slavery ...

Justice Harlan dissented against the Court&#x27;s narrow interpretation of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments for all five of the cases. He argued Congress was attempting to overcome the refusal of the states to protect the rights denied to African Americans that white citizens took as their birthright. Private railroads (&quot;Olcott v. Supervisors&quot;) were by law public highways, and it was the function of the government to make and maintain highways for the conveyance of the public; that innkeepers have long been held to be &quot;a sort of public servants&quot; (&quot;Rex v. Ivens&quot; 1835 7 Car. &amp; P. 213) who had no right to deny to anyone &quot;conducting himself in a proper manner&quot; admission to his inn; and that public amusements are maintained under a license coming from the State. He also found that the lack of protection from the 1875 Civil Rights Act would result in the violation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, largely on the same grounds. Harlan J would have held the Civil Rights Act of 1875 valid, because people were left &quot;practically at the mercy of corporations and individuals wielding power under public authority&quot;. His judgment went as follows.
The opinion in these cases proceeds, as it seems to me, upon grounds entirely too narrow and artificial. The substance and spirit of the recent amendments of the constitution have been sacrificed by a subtle and ingenious verbal criticism. &#x27;It is not the words of the law but the internal sense of it that makes the law. The letter of the law is the body; the sense and reason of the law is the soul.&#x27; Constitutional provisions, adopted in the interest of liberty, and for the purpose of securing, through national legislation, if need be, rights inhering in a state of freedom, and belonging to American citizenship, have been so construed as to defeat the ends the people desired to accomplish, which they attempted to accomplish, and which they supposed they had accomplished by changes in their fundamental law. By this I do not mean that the determination of these cases should have been materially controlled by considerations of mere expediency or policy. I mean only, in this form, to express an earnest conviction that the court has departed from the familiar rule requiring, in the interpretation of constitutional provisions, that full effect be given to the intent with which they were adopted.

The purpose of the first section of the act of congress of March 1, 1875, was to prevent race discrimination. It does not assume to define the general conditions and limitations under which inns, public conveyances, and places of public amusement may be conducted, but only declares that such conditions and limitations, whatever they may be, shall not be applied, by way of discrimination, on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. The second section provides a penalty against any one denying, or aiding or inciting the denial, to any citizen that equality of right given by the first section, except for reasons by law applicable to citizens of every race or color, and regardless of any previous condition of servitude...

The court adjudges that congress is without power, under either the thirteenth or fourteenth amendment, to establish such regulations, and that the first and second sections of the statute are, in all their parts, unconstitutional and void.

I do not contend that the thirteenth amendment invests congress with authority, by legislation, to regulate the entire body of the civil rights which citizens enjoy, or may enjoy, in the several states. But I do hold that since slavery, as the court has repeatedly declared, was the moving or principal cause of the adoption of that amendment, and since that institution rested wholly upon the inferiority, as a race, of those held in bondage, their freedom necessarily involved immunity from, and protection against, all discrimination against them, because of their race, in respect of such civil rights as belong to freemen of other races. Congress, therefore, under its express power to enforce that amendment, by appropriate legislation, may enact laws to protect that people against the deprivation, on account of their race, of any civil rights enjoyed by other freemen in the same state; and such legislation may be of a direct and primary character, operating upon states, their officers and agents, and also upon, at least, such individuals and corporations as exercise public functions and wield power and authority under the state.

Such being the relations these corporations hold to the public, it would seem that the right of a colored person to use an improved public highway, upon the terms accorded to freemen of other races, is as fundamental in the state of freedom, established in this country, as are any of the rights which my brethren concede to be so far fundamental as to be deemed the essence of civil freedom. &#x27;Personal liberty consists,&#x27; says Blackstone, &#x27;in the power of locomotion, of changing situation, or removing one&#x27;s person to whatever place one&#x27;s own inclination may direct, without restraint, unless by due course of law.&#x27; But of what value is this right of locomotion, if it may be clogged by such burdens as congress intended by the act of 1875 to remove? They are burdens which lay at the very foundation of the institution of slavery as it once existed. They are not to be sustained, except upon the assumption that there is still, in this land of universal liberty, a class which may yet be discriminated against, even in respect of rights of a character so essential and so supreme, that, deprived of their enjoyment, in common with others, a freeman is not only branded as one inferior and infected, but, in the competitions of life, is robbed of some of the most necessary means of existence; and all this solely because they belong to a particular race which the nation has liberated. The thirteenth amendment alone obliterated the race line, so far as all rights fundamental in a state of freedom are concerned.

Said Mr. Justice Coleridge, in &quot;Rex v. Ivens&quot;, 7 Car. &amp; P. 213, (32 E. C. L. 495:)

&#x27;An indictment lies against an innkeeper who refuses to receive a guest, he having at the time room in his house; and either the price of the guest&#x27;s entertainment being tendered to him, or such circumstances occurring as will dispense with that tender. This law is founded in good sense. The innkeeper is not to select his guests. He has no right to say to one, you shall come to my inn, and to another you shall not, as every one coming and conducting himself in a proper manner has a right to be received; and for this purpose innkeepers are a sort of public servants, they having in return a kind of privilege of entertaining travelers and supplying them with that they want.

These authorities are sufficient to show a keeper of an inn is in the exercise of a quasi public employment. The law gives him special privileges, and he is charged with certain duties and responsibilities to the public. The public nature of his employment forbids him from discriminating against any person asking admission as a guest on account of the race or color of that person.

I also submit whether it can be said—in view of the doctrines of this court as announced in &quot;Munn v. Illinois&quot;, U.S. 123, and reaffirmed in &quot;Peik v. Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. Co.&quot; 94 U.S. 178—that the management of places of public amusement is a purely private matter, with which government has no rightful concern. In the Munn Case the question was whether the state of Illinois could fix, by law, the maximum of charges for the storage of grain in certain warehouses in that state—the private property of individual citizens. After quoting a remark attributed to Lord Chief Justice HALE, to the effect that when private property is &#x27;affected with a public interest it ceases to be &quot;juris privati&quot; only,&#x27; the court says:

&#x27;Property does become clothed with a public interest when used in a manner to make it of public consequence and affect the community at large. When, therefore, one devotes his property to a use in which the public has an interest, he in effect grants to the public an interest in that use, and must submit to be controlled by the public for the common good to the extent of the interest he has thus created. He may withdraw his grant by discontinuing the use, but, so long as he maintains the use, he must submit to the control.&#x27;

The doctrines of &quot;Munn v. Illinois&quot; have never been modified by this court, and I am justified, upon the authority of that case, in saying that places of public amusement, conducted under the authority of the law, are clothed with a public interest, because used in a manner to make them of public consequence and to affect the community at large. The law may therefore regulate, to some extent, the mode in which they shall be conducted, and consequently the public have rights in respect of such places which may be vindicated by the law. It is consequently not a matter purely of private concern.

The colored citizens of other states, within the jurisdiction of that state, could claim, under the constitution, every privilege and immunity which that state secures to her white citizens. Otherwise, it would be in the power of any state, by discriminating class legislation against its own citizens of a particular race or color, to withhold from citizens of other states, belonging to that proscribed race, when within her limits, privileges and immunities of the character regarded by all courts as fundamental in citizenship; and that, too, when the constitutional guaranty is that the citizens of each state shall be entitled to &#x27;all privileges and immunities of citizens of the several states.&#x27; No state may, by discrimination against a portion of its own citizens of a particular race, in respect of privileges and immunities fundamental in citizenship, impair the constitutional right of citizens of other states, of whatever race, to enjoy in that state all such privileges and immunities as are there accorded to her most favored citizens. A colored citizen of Ohio or Indiana, being in the jurisdiction of Tennessee, is entitled to enjoy any privilege or immunity, fundamental in citizenship, which is given to citizens of the white race in the latter state. It is not to be supposed that any one will controvert this proposition.

But what was secured to colored citizens of the United States as between them and their respective states—by the grant to them of state citizenship? With what rights, privileges, or immunities did this grant from the nation invest them? There is one, if there be no others—exemption from race discrimination in respect of any civil right belonging to citizens of the white race in the same state. That, surely, is their constitutional privilege when within the jurisdiction of other states. And such must be their constitutional right, in their own state, unless the recent amendments be &#x27;splendid baubles,&#x27; thrown out to delude those who deserved fair and generous treatment at the hands of the nation. Citizenship in this country necessarily imports equality of civil rights among citizens of every race in the same state. It is fundamental in American citizenship that, in respect of such rights, there shall be no discrimination by the state, or its officers, or by individuals, or corporations exercising public functions or authority, against any citizen because of his race or previous condition of servitude. In &quot;U.S. v. Cruikshank&quot;, 92 U. S. 555, it was said that &#x27;the equality of rights of citizens is a principle of republicanism.&#x27; And in &quot;Ex parte Virginia&quot;, 100 U. S. 344, the emphatic language of this court is that &#x27;one great purpose of these amendments was to raise the colored race from that condition of inferiority and servitude in which most of them had previously stood, into perfect equality of civil rights with all other persons within the jurisdiction of the states.&#x27; So, in &quot;Strauder v. West Virginia&quot;, Id. 306, the court, alluding to the fourteenth amendment, said: &#x27;This is one of a series of constitutional provisions having a common purpose, namely, securing to a race recently emancipated, a race that through many generations had been held in slavery, all the civil rights that the superior race enjoy.&#x27; Again, in &quot;Neal v. Delaware&quot;, 103 U. S. 386, it was ruled that this amendment was designed, primarily, &#x27;to secure to the colored race, thereby invested with the rights, privileges, and responsibilities of citizenship, the enjoyment of all the civil rights that, under the law, are enjoyed by white persons.&#x27;

This court has always given a broad and liberal construction to the constitution, so as to enable congress, by legislation, to enforce rights secured by that instrument. The legislation congress may enact, in execution of its power to enforce the provisions of this amendment, is that which is appropriate to protect the right granted. Under given circumstances, that which the court characterizes as corrective legislation might be sufficient. Under other circumstances primary direct legislation may be required. But it is for congress, not the judiciary, to say which is best adapted to the end to be attained. In &quot;U.S. v. Fisher&quot;, 2 Cranch, 358, this court said that &#x27;congress must possess the choice of means, and must be empowered to use any means which are in fact conducive to the exercise of a power granted by the constitution.&#x27; &#x27;The sound construction of the constitution,&#x27; said Chief Justice MARSHALL, &#x27;must allow to the national legislature that discretion, with respect to the means by which the powers it confers are to be carried into execution, which will enable that body to perform the high duties assigned to it in the manner most beneficial to the people. Let the end be legitimate,—let it be within the scope of the constitution,—and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consistent with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.&#x27; &quot;McCulloch v. Maryland&quot;, 4 Wheat. 423.

Must these rules of construction be now abandoned? Are the powers of the national legislature to be restrained in proportion as the rights and privileges, derived from the nation, are more valuable? Are constitutional provisions, enacted to secure the dearest rights of freemen and citizens, to be subjected to that rule of construction, applicable to private instruments, which requires that the words to be interpreted must be taken most strongly against those who employ them? Or shall it be remembered that &#x27;a constitution of government, founded by the people for themselves and their posterity, and for objects of the most momentous nature,—for perpetual union, for the establishment of justice, for the general welfare, and for a perpetuation of the blessings of liberty,—necessarily requires that every interpretation of its powers should have a constant reference to these objects? No interpretation of the words in which those powers are granted can be a sound one which narrows down their ordinary import so as to defeat those objects.&#x27; 1 Story, Const. § 422.

In every material sense applicable to the practical enforcement of the fourteenth amendment, railroad corporations, keepers of inns, and managers of places of public amusement are agents of the state, because amenable, in respect of their public duties and functions, to public regulation. It seems to me that, within the principle settled in &quot;Ex parte Virginia&quot;, a denial by these instrumentalities of the state to the citizen, because of his race, of that equality of civil rights secured to him by law, is a denial by the state within the meaning of the fourteenth amendment. If it be not, then that race is left, in respect of the civil rights under discussion, practically at the mercy of corporations and individuals wielding power under public authority...

What I affirm is that no state, nor the officers of any state, nor any corporation or individual wielding power under state authority for the public benefit or the public convenience, can, consistently either with the freedom established by the fundamental law, or with that equality of civil rights which now belongs to every citizen, discriminate against freemen or citizens, in their civil rights, because of their race, or because they once labored under disabilities imposed upon them as a race. The rights which congress, by the act of 1875, endeavored to secure and protect are legal, not social, rights. The right, for instance, of a colored citizen to use the accommodations of a public highway upon the same terms as are permitted to white citizens is no more a social right than his right, under the law, to use the public streets of a city, or a town, or a turnpike road, or a public market, or a post-office, or his right to sit in a public building with others, of whatever race, for the purpose of hearing the political questions of the day discussed. Scarcely a day passes without our seeing in this court-room citizens of the white and black races sitting side by side watching the progress of our business. It would never occur to any one that the presence of a colored citizen in a court-house or court-room was an invasion of the social rights of white persons who may frequent such places. And yet such a suggestion would be quite as sound in law—I say it with all respect—as is the suggestion that the claim of a colored citizen to use, upon the same terms as is permitted to white citizens, the accommodations of public highways, or public inns, or places of public amusement, established under the license of the law, is an invasion of the social rights of the white race.

The one underlying purpose of congressional legislation has been to enable the black race to take the rank of mere citizens. The difficulty has been to compel a recognition of their legal right to take that rank, and to secure the enjoyment of privileges belonging, under the law, to them as a component part of the people for whose welfare and happiness government is ordained. At every step in this direction the nation has been confronted with class tyranny, which a contemporary English historian says is, of all tyrannies, the most intolerable, &#x27;for it is ubiquitous in its operation, and weighs, perhaps, most heavily on those whose obscurity or distance would withdraw them from the notice of a single despot.&#x27; To-day it is the colored race which is denied, by corporations and individuals wielding public authority, rights fundamental in their freedom and citizenship. At some future time it may be some other race that will fall under the ban. If the constitutional amendments be enforced, according to the intent with which, as I conceive, they were adopted, there cannot be, in this republic, any class of human beings in practical subjection to another class, with power in the latter to dole out to the former just such privileges as they may choose to grant. The supreme law of the land has decreed that no authority shall be exercised in this country upon the basis of discrimination, in respect of civil rights, against freemen and citizens because of their race, color, or previous condition of servitude. To that decree—for the due enforcement of which, by appropriate legislation, congress has been invested with express power—every one must bow, whatever may have been, or whatever now are, his individual views as to the wisdom or policy, either of the recent changes in the fundamental law, or of the legislation which has been enacted to give them effect.

For the reasons stated I feel constrained to withhold my assent to the opinion of the court.

==Significance==
The decision met with public protest across the country, and led to regular &quot;indignation meetings&quot; held in numerous cities. State officials in the South took advantage of the eclipsed role of Congress in the prohibition of racial discrimination and proceeded to embody individual practices of racial segregation into laws that legalized the treatment of blacks as second-class citizens for another seventy years. The court&#x27;s decision thus ultimately led to the enactment of state laws, such as Jim Crow Laws, which codified what had previously been individual adherence to the practice of racial segregation. Several northern and western states however did not follow suit and began instead enacting their own bans on discrimination in public places.

Harlan correctly predicted the decision&#x27;s long-term consequences: it put an end to the attempts by Radical Republicans to ensure the civil rights of blacks and ushered in the widespread segregation of blacks in housing, employment and public life that confined them to second-class citizenship throughout much of the United States until the passage of civil rights legislation in the 1960s in the wake of the Civil Rights Movement.

Furthermore, 
In the wake of the Supreme Court ruling, the federal government adopted as policy that allegations of continuing slavery were matters whose prosecution should be left to local authorities only – a de facto acceptance that white southerners could do as they wished with the black people in their midst.

The decision that the Reconstruction-era Civil Rights Acts were unconstitutional has not been overturned; on the contrary, the Supreme Court reaffirmed this limited reading of the Fourteenth Amendment in &quot;United States v. Morrison&quot;, , in which it held that Congress did not have the authority to enact parts of the Violence Against Women Act.

The Court has, however, upheld more recent civil rights laws based on other powers of Congress. Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 generally revived the ban on discrimination in public accommodations that was in the Civil Rights Act of 1875, but under the Commerce Clause of Article I instead of the 14th Amendment; the Court held Title II to be constitutional in &quot;Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States&quot;, .

<doc id="146265" wikidata="Q6936773" url="?curid=146265" title="Munn v. Illinois">
<text>Munn v. Illinois, 94 U.S. 113 (1876), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld the power of state governments to regulate private industries that affect &quot;the common good.&quot;

==Facts==
The case was developed because in 1871, the legislature of Illinois responded to pressure from the National Grange, an association of farmers, by setting maximum rates that private companies could charge for the storage and transport of agricultural products. The Chicago grain warehouse firm of Munn and Scott was found guilty of violating the law but appealed the conviction on the grounds that the law was an unconstitutional deprivation of property without due process of law that violated the Fourteenth Amendment. A state trial court and the Illinois State Supreme Court both ruled in favor of the State.

==Judgment== 
The Supreme Court decided the appeal in 1877. Chief Justice Morrison Waite spoke for the majority, which affirmed the constitutionality of state regulation extending to private industries that affect public interests. Because grain storage facilities were devoted to public use, their rates were subject to public regulation. He specified that any such regulation by the state government would not be in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Chief Justice Waite declared that even if Congress alone is granted control over interstate commerce, a state could take action in the public interest without impairing that federal control.

Justice Field and Justice Strong dissented.

<doc id="146268" wikidata="Q937061" url="?curid=146268" title="Fletcher v. Peck">
<text>Fletcher v. Peck, 10 U.S. (6 Cranch) 87 (1810), was a landmark United States Supreme Court decision in which the Supreme Court first ruled a state law unconstitutional. The decision created a growing precedent for the sanctity of legal contracts and hinted that Native Americans did not hold complete title to their own lands (an idea fully realized in &quot;Johnson v. McIntosh&quot;).

==Background==
Following the Treaty of Paris ending the American Revolution, Georgia claimed possession of the Yazoo lands, a region of the Indian Reserve, west of its own territory. The land later became the northern part of the states of Alabama and Mississippi.

In 1795, the Georgia legislature divided the area into four tracts. The state then sold the tracts to four separate land development companies for $500,000, about $0.014 per acre, a bargain even at 1790 prices. The Georgia legislature overwhelmingly approved this land grant, known as the Yazoo Land Act of 1795. However, it was later revealed that the Yazoo Land Act had been approved in return for bribes in a scandal known as the Yazoo Land Scandal. The voters rejected most of the incumbents in the next election; the new legislature, reacting to the public outcry, repealed the law and voided the transactions made under it.

Robert Fletcher bought a tract of land from Peck after the 1795 act was repealed. Fletcher, in 1803, brought a suit against Peck, claiming that Peck had not had clear title to the land when he sold it.

There was collusion between the two. Both would have their land secured if the Supreme Court decided that Native Americans did not hold original title. Fletcher set out to win the case.

==Court ruling==
The Supreme Court unanimously (with a separate concurring opinion written by William Johnson) ruled that the legislature&#x27;s repeal of the law was unconstitutional. John Marshall wrote that the sale was a binding contract, which under Article I, Section 10, Clause I (the Contract Clause) of the Constitution, cannot be invalidated even if it is illegally secured.

The ruling lent further protection to property rights against popular pressure and is the earliest case of the Court asserting its right to invalidate state laws which are in conflict with or are otherwise contrary to the Constitution. A later Chief Justice, William H. Rehnquist, wrote that &quot;Fletcher v. Peck&quot; &quot;represented an attempt by Chief Justice Marshall to extend the protection of the contract clause to infant business&quot;.

Founded in 1842 by members of the Congregation of Holy Cross, a Catholic religious order of priests and brothers, the main campus of 1,261 acres (510 ha) has a suburban setting and contains landmarks such as the Golden Dome main building, Sacred Heart basilica, the Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes, the Word of Life mosaic mural, and Notre Dame Stadium.

Notre Dame is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. The university is organized into seven schools and colleges: College of Arts and Letters, College of Science, Notre Dame Law School, School of Architecture, College of Engineering, Mendoza College of Business, and Keough School of Global Affairs. Notre Dame&#x27;s graduate program includes more than 50 master, doctoral and professional degrees offered by the seven schools.

The university&#x27;s athletic teams are members of the NCAA Division I and are known collectively as the Fighting Irish. Notre Dame is noted for its football team, which contributed to its rise to prominence on the national stage in the early 20th century. Notre Dame teams in other sports, chiefly in the Atlantic Coast Conference, have won 17 national championships.

Major improvements to the university occurred during Theodore Hesburgh&#x27;s administration between 1952 and 1987. Hesburgh&#x27;s administration increased the university&#x27;s resources, academic programs, and its reputation. At the end of the fiscal year 2022, Notre Dame&#x27;s endowment was valued at $20.3 billion. Its network of alumni consists of 151,000 members.

==History==
===Foundations===
Stephen Badin, the first priest ordained in the United States, had come to the area invited by Potawatomi chief Leopold Pokagon to minister to his tribe, and had bought these of land in 1830. In 1842, the bishop of Vincennes, Célestin Guynemer de la Hailandière, offered the land to Edward Sorin of the Congregation of Holy Cross, on the condition that he build a college in two years. Sorin arrived on the site with eight Holy Cross brothers from France and Ireland on November 26, 1842, and began the school using Badin&#x27;s old log chapel. After enrolling two students, Sorin soon erected more buildings, including the Old College, the first church, and the first main building. Notre Dame began as a primary and secondary school; in 1844 it received its official college charter from the Indiana General Assembly, under the name the University of Notre Dame du Lac (University of Our Lady of the Lake). The university was originally all-male; the Sisters of the Holy Cross founded the female-only Saint Mary&#x27;s College near Notre Dame in 1844.
===Early history===
The college awarded its first degrees in 1849. As it grew under the presidency of Sorin and his successors, new academic programs were offered and new buildings built to accommodate the growing student and faculty population. The brief presidency of Patrick Dillon (1865–1866) saw the original main building replaced with a larger one, which housed the university&#x27;s administration, classrooms, and dormitories. Under William Corby&#x27;s first administration, enrollment at Notre Dame increased to over 500 students. In 1869, he opened the law school, which offered a two-year course of study, and in 1871 he began construction of Sacred Heart Church, today the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Two years later, Auguste Lemonnier started a library in the Main Building, which had 10,000 volumes by 1879.
Fire destroyed the Main Building and the library collection in April 1879; the school closed immediately and students were sent home. Rebuilding began on May 17, and the third and current Main Building was completed before the fall semester of 1879. The library collection was redeveloped.

The presidency of Thomas E. Walsh (1881–1893) focused on improving Notre Dame&#x27;s scholastic reputation and standards. At the time, many students came to Notre Dame only for its business courses and did not graduate. Walsh started a &quot;Belles Lettres&quot; program and invited notable lay intellectuals like writer Maurice Francis Egan to campus. Washington Hall was built in 1881 as a theater, and the Science Hall (today the LaFortune Student Center) was built in 1883 to house the science program (established in 1880) and multiple classrooms and science labs. The construction of Sorin Hall saw the first freestanding residence hall on campus and one of the first in the country to have private rooms for students, a project championed by Sorin and John Zahm. During Walsh&#x27;s tenure, Notre Dame started its football program and was awarded the first Laetare Medal. The Law School was reorganized under the leadership of William J. Hoynes (dean from 1883 to 1919), and when its new building was opened shortly after his death, it was renamed in his honor.

===Growth===
John Zahm was the Holy Cross Provincial for the United States from 1898 to 1906, with overall supervision of the university. He sought to modernize and expand Notre Dame by erecting buildings and adding to the campus art gallery and library, amassing what became a famous Dante collection, and pushing Notre Dame toward becoming a research university dedicated to scholarship. The congregation did not renew Zahm&#x27;s term, fearing he had expanded Notre Dame too quickly and had run the order into serious debt. In particular, his vision to make Notre Dame a research university was at odds with that of Andrew Morrissey (president from 1893 to 1905), who hoped to keep the institution a smaller boarding school. Morrissey&#x27;s presidency remained largely focused on younger students and saw the construction of the Grotto, the addition of wings to Sorin Hall, and the erection of the first gymnasium. By 1900, student enrollment had increased to over 700, with most students still following the Commercial Course.
The movement toward a research university was championed subsequently by John W. Cavanaugh, who modernized educational standards and dedicated himself to the school&#x27;s academic reputation and to increasing the number of students awarded bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees. As part of his efforts, he attracted many eminent scholars, established a chair in journalism, and introduced courses in chemical engineering. During his time as president, Notre Dame rapidly became a significant force on the football field. In 1917, Notre Dame awarded its first degree to a woman, and its first bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1922. However, female undergraduates were uncommon until 1972. James A. Burns became president in 1919 and, following in the footsteps of Cavanaugh, he oversaw an academic revolution that brought the school up to national standards by adopting the elective system and moving away from the traditional scholastic and classical emphasis in three years. Notre Dame continued to grow, adding more colleges, programs, residence halls, and sports teams. By 1921, with the addition of the College of Commerce, Notre Dame had grown from a small college to a university with five colleges and a law school.

President Matthew Walsh (1922–1928) addressed the material needs of the university, particularly the $10,000 debt and the lack of space for new students. When he assumed the presidency, more than 1,100 students lived off campus while only 135 students paid for room and board. With fund-raising money, Walsh concentrated on the construction of a dormitory system. He built Freshman Hall in 1922 and Sophomore Hall in 1923, and began construction of Morrissey, Howard and Lyons Halls between 1924 and 1925. By 1925, enrollment had increased to 2,500 students, of which 1,471 lived on campus; faculty members increased from 90 to 175. On the academic side, credit hours were reduced to encourage in-depth study, and Latin and Greek were no longer required. In 1928, three years of college were made a prerequisite for the study of law. Walsh expanded the College of Commerce, enlarged the stadium, completed South Dining Hall, and built the memorial and entrance transept of the Basilica.

One of the main driving forces in the university&#x27;s growth was its football team, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. Knute Rockne became head coach in 1918. Under him, the Irish won three national championships, had five undefeated seasons, won the Rose Bowl Game in 1925, and produced players such as George Gipp and the &quot;Four Horsemen&quot;. Knute Rockne has the highest winning percentage (.881) in NCAA Division I/FBS football history. Rockne&#x27;s offenses employed the Notre Dame Box and his defenses ran a 7–2–2 scheme.

The success of Notre Dame reflected the rising status of Irish Americans and Catholics in the 1920s. Catholics rallied around the team and listened to the games on the radio, especially when it defeated teams from schools that symbolized the Protestant establishment in America—Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Army. Its role as a high-profile flagship institution of Catholicism made it an easy target of anti-Catholicism. The most remarkable episode of violence was a clash in 1924 between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), a white supremacist and anti-Catholic movement. The Klan decided to hold a week-long Klavern in South Bend. Clashes with the student body started on May 17, when students blocked the Klansmen from descending from their trains in the South Bend station and ripped KKK clothes and regalia. Two days later, thousands of students massed downtown protesting the Klavern, and only the arrival of college president Walsh prevented any further clashes. The next day, Rockne spoke at a campus rally and implored the students to refrain from further violence. A few days later, the Klavern broke up, but the hostility shown by the students contributed to the downfall of the KKK in Indiana.

===Expansion in the 1930s and 1940s===

Charles L. O&#x27;Donnell (1928–1934) and John Francis O&#x27;Hara (1934–1939) fueled both material and academic expansion. During their tenures at Notre Dame, they brought many refugees and intellectuals to campus, such as W. B. Yeats, Frank H. Spearman, Jeremiah D. M. Ford, Irvin Abell, and Josephine Brownson for the Laetare Medal, instituted in 1883. O&#x27;Hara also concentrated on expanding the graduate school. New construction included Notre Dame Stadium, the law school building, Rockne Memorial, numerous residential halls, Cushing Hall of Engineering, and a new heating plant. This rapid expansion, which cost the university more than $2.8 million, was made possible in large part through football revenues. O&#x27;Hara strongly believed that the Fighting Irish football team could be an effective means to &quot;acquaint the public with the ideals that dominate&quot; Notre Dame. He wrote, &quot;Notre Dame football is a spiritual service because it is played for the honor and glory of God and of his Blessed Mother. When St. Paul said: &#x27;Whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all for the glory of God,&#x27; he included football.&quot;

During World War II, O&#x27;Donnell offered Notre Dame&#x27;s facilities to the armed forces. The Navy accepted his offer and installed Naval Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) units on campus as part of the V-12 Navy College Training Program. Soon after the installation, there were only a few hundred civilian students at Notre Dame. O&#x27;Donnell continued O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s work with the graduate school. He formalized the graduate program further and replaced the previous committee of graduate studies with a dean.

John J. Cavanaugh, president from 1946 to 1952, devoted his efforts to raising academic standards and reshaping the university administration to better serve its educational mission and an expanded student body. He stressed advanced studies and research while quadrupling the university&#x27;s student population, with undergraduate enrollment seeing an increase by more than half, and graduate student enrollment growing fivefold. Cavanaugh established the Lobund Institute for Animal Studies and Notre Dame&#x27;s Medieval Institute, presided over the construction of Nieuwland Science Hall, Fisher Hall, and the Morris Inn, and the Hall of Liberal Arts (now O&#x27;Shaughnessy Hall), made possible by a donation from I. A. O&#x27;Shaughnessy, at the time the largest ever made to an American Catholic university. He also established the university&#x27;s system of advisory councils.

===Hesburgh era: 1952–1987===

Theodore Hesburgh served as president for 35 years (1952–1987). Under his presidency, Notre Dame underwent huge growth and transformation from a school mostly known for its football to a top-tier university, academic powerhouse, and preeminent Catholic university. The annual operating budget rose by a factor of 18, from $9.7 million to $176.6 million; the endowment by a factor of 40, from $9 million to $350 million; and research funding by a factor of 20, from $735,000 to $15 million. Enrollment nearly doubled from 4,979 to 9,600; faculty more than doubled from 389 to 950, and degrees awarded annually doubled from 1,212 to 2,500.

Hesburgh made Notre Dame coeducational. Women had graduated every year since 1917, but they were mostly religious sisters in graduate programs. In the mid-1960s, Notre Dame and Saint Mary&#x27;s College developed a co-exchange program whereby several hundred students took classes not offered at their home institution. After extensive debate, merging with St. Mary&#x27;s was rejected, primarily because of the differential in faculty qualifications and pay scales. &quot;In American college education,&quot; explained Charles E. Sheedy, Notre Dame&#x27;s dean of Arts and Letters, &quot;certain features formerly considered advantageous and enviable are now seen as anachronistic and out of place. ... In this environment of diversity, the integration of the sexes is a normal and expected aspect, replacing separatism.&quot; Two of the residence halls were converted for the newly admitted female students that first year, with two more converted the next school year. In 1971, Mary Ann Proctor, a transfer from St. Mary&#x27;s, became the first female undergraduate. The following year, Mary Davey Bliley became the first woman to graduate from the university, with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in marketing. In 1978, a historic district comprising 21 contributing buildings was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Recent history===
In the eighteen years Edward Malloy was president, the school&#x27;s reputation, faculty, and resources grew rapidly. He added more than 500 professors and the academic quality of the student body improved dramatically, with the average Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) score rising from 1240 to 1460. The number of minority students more than doubled, the endowment grew from $350 million to more than $3 billion, the annual operating budget rose from $177 million to more than $650 million, and annual research funding improved from $15 million to more than $70 million. Notre Dame&#x27;s most recent (2014) capital campaign raised $2.014 billion, far exceeding its goal of $767 million. It was the largest in the history of Catholic higher education, and the largest of any university without a medical school at the time.

John I. Jenkins took over from Malloy in 2005. In his inaugural address, Jenkins described his goals of making the university a leader in research that recognizes ethics and builds the connection between faith and studies. During his tenure, Notre Dame has increased its endowment, enlarged its student body, and undergone many construction projects on campus, including the Compton Family Ice Arena, a new architecture hall, and additional residence halls. Announced as an integration of &quot;the academy, student life and athletics,&quot; construction on the Campus Crossroads project began around Notre Dame Stadium in November 2014. Its three buildings house student life services, an indoor gym, a recreation center, the career center, a 500-seat student ballroom, the departments of anthropology and psychology, a digital media center and the department of music and sacred music program.

Jenkins announced the 2023–2024 academic year would be his last as president in October 2023. The board of trustees subsequently elected Robert A. Dowd to succeed him, effective June 1, 2024.

==Campus==

Notre Dame&#x27;s campus is located in Notre Dame, Indiana, in the Michiana area of Northern Indiana. It lies on south of the Indiana Toll Road and includes around 170 buildings and athletic fields located around its two lakes and seven quadrangles.
It is consistently ranked as one of the most beautiful university campuses in the United States and around the world, and it is noted particularly for the Golden Dome, the Basilica and its stained glass windows, the quads and the greenery, the Grotto, the Hesburgh Library with its Word of Life stone mural (nicknamed &quot;Touchdown Jesus&quot; by students), and its statues and museums. Notre Dame is a major tourist attraction in northern Indiana; in the 2015–2016 academic year, more than 1.8 million visitors, almost half of whom were from outside St. Joseph County, visited the campus.
A historic district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 as University of Notre Dame: Main and South Quadrangles. The district includes 21 contributing buildings in the core of the original campus such as the Main Administration Building and the Basilica.

=== Administration and academic buildings ===
The Main Building serves as the center for the university&#x27;s administrative offices, including the Office of the President. Its golden dome, topped by the statue of Mary, is the campus&#x27; most recognizable landmark. The main building is located on Main Quad (also known as &quot;God Quad&quot;), which is the oldest, most historic, and most central part of campus. Behind the main building stand several facilities with administrative purposes and student services, including Carole Sadner Hall, Brownson Hall, and St. Liam&#x27;s Hall, the campus health center.

There are several religious buildings The current Basilica of the Sacred Heart is on the site of Sorin&#x27;s original church, which had become too small for the growing college. It is built in French Revival style, with stained glass windows imported from France. Luigi Gregori, an Italian painter invited by Sorin to be an artist in residence, painted the interior. The basilica also features a bell tower with a carillon. Inside the church, there are sculptures by Ivan Meštrović. The Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes, built in 1896, is a replica of the original in Lourdes and is a popular spot for prayer and meditation. The Old College building has become one of two seminaries on the campus run by the Congregation of Holy Cross.
Academic buildings are concentrated in the Center-South and Center-East sections of campus. McCourtney Hall, an interdisciplinary research facility, opened its doors for the fall 2016 semester, and ground was broken on the Walsh Family Hall of Architecture on the south end of campus near the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center opened in fall 2018. Since 2004, several buildings have been added, including the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, the Guglielmino Complex, and the Jordan Hall of Science. A new engineering building, Stinson-Remick Hall, a new combination Center for Social Concerns/Institute for Church Life building, Geddes Hall, and a law school addition were completed at the same time. Many academic buildings were built with a system of libraries, the most prominent of which is the Hesburgh Library, built in 1963 and today containing almost four million books. The Stayer Center for Executive Education, which houses the Mendoza College of Business Executive Education Department, opened in March 2013 just South of the Mendoza College of Business building.

=== Residential and student buildings ===

There are 33 single-sex undergraduate residence halls. The university has recently announced a co-educational undergraduate dorm community based in one of the graduate residential apartments. Most of the graduate students on campus live in one of four graduate housing complexes on campus. A new residence for men, Baumer Hall, was built in 2019. Johnson Family Hall, for women, was also completed and opened that semester. The South Dining Hall and North Dining Hall serve the student body.

The campus hosts several entertainment, general purpose, and common spaces. LaFortune Student Center, commonly known as &quot;LaFortune&quot; or &quot;LaFun,&quot; is a four-story building built in 1883 that serves the student union and hosts social, recreational, cultural, and educational activities. LaFortune hosts many businesses (including restaurant chains), student services, and divisions of The Office of Student Affairs. A second student union came with the addition of Duncan Student Center, which is built onto the Notre Dame Stadium as part of the Campus Crossroads projects. As well as additional food service chains, recreation facilities, and student offices, Duncan also hosts a student gym and a ballroom. 

=== Athletics facilities ===
Because of its long athletic tradition, the university features many athletic buildings, which are concentrated in the southern and eastern sections of campus. The most prominent is Notre Dame Stadium, home of the Fighting Irish football team; it has been renovated several times and today can seat over 80,000 people. Prominent venues include the Edmund P. Joyce Center, with indoor basketball and volleyball courts, and the Compton Family Ice Arena, a two-rink facility dedicated to hockey. There are many outdoor fields, such as the Frank Eck Stadium for baseball.

Legends of Notre Dame (commonly called Legends) is a music venue, public house, and restaurant on campus, just south of the stadium. The former Alumni Senior Club opened in September 2003 after a $3.5 million renovation and became an all-ages student hang-out. Legends is made up of two parts: The Restaurant and Alehouse and the nightclub.
===Environmental sustainability===
The Office of Sustainability was created in the fall of 2007 at the recommendation of a Sustainability Strategy Working Group and appointed the first director in April 2008. The pursuit of sustainability is related directly to the Catholic mission of the university. Other resources and centers on campus focusing on sustainability include the Environmental Change Initiative, Environmental Research Center, and the Center for Sustainable Energy at Notre Dame. The university also houses the Kellogg Institute for International Peace Studies.

Notre Dame received a gold rating from the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) in 2014, though in 2017 it was downgraded to silver. In 2016, the Office of Sustainability released its Comprehensive Sustainability Strategy to achieve its goals in a wide area of university operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;About the Office//Office of Sustainability//University of Notre Dame&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; , 17 buildings have achieved LEED-Certified status, with 12 of them earning Gold certification. Notre Dame&#x27;s dining service sources 40 percent of its food locally and offers sustainably caught seafood and many organic, fair-trade, and vegan options.&lt;ref name=&quot;Design &amp; Construction//Office of Sustainability//University of Notre Dame&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2019, irrigation systems&#x27; improvements led to 244 million fewer gallons of water being used and a 50 percent reduction in water consumption over 10 years.

In 2015, Notre Dame announced major environmental sustainability goals, including eliminating using coal by 2020 and reducing its carbon footprint by half by 2030. Both these goals were reached in early 2019. This was achieved by implementing energy conservation, energy efficiency strategies, temperature setpoints, low-flow water devices, and diversifying its energy sources and infrastructures. New sources of renewable energy on campus include geothermal wells on East Quad and by the Notre Dame Stadium, substitution of boilers with gas turbines, solar panels on Fitzpatrick Hall and Stinson-Remick Hall and off-campus, a hydroelectric facility at Seitz Park in South Bend powered by the St. Joseph River, and heat recovery strategies. Future projects outlined by the university&#x27;s utilities long-range plan include continual diversification of its energy portfolio, future geothermal wells in new buildings and some existing facilities, and a collaboration with the South Bend Solar Project. Current goals include cutting Notre Dame&#x27;s carbon footprint by 83 percent by 2050 and eventually becoming carbon neutral, diverting 67 percent of all waste from landfills by 2030.

===Global Gateways===

The university owns several centers around the world used for international studies and research, conferences abroad, and alumni support.
*&quot;London&quot;. The university has had a presence in London since 1968. Since 1998, its London center has been based in Fischer Hall, the former United University Club in Trafalgar Square. The center hosts the university&#x27;s programs in the city, and conferences and symposia. The university also owns a residence facility, Conway Hall, for students studying abroad.
*&quot;Beijing&quot;. The university owns space in the Liangmaqiao Station area. The center is the hub of Notre Dame Asia. It hosts a number of programs including study abroad.

*&quot;Dublin&quot;. The university owns the O&#x27;Connell House, a building in Merrion Square in the heart of Georgian Dublin. It hosts academic programs and summer internships in Irish studies for both undergraduate and graduate students in addition to seminars, and is home to the Keough Naughton Centre. Since 2015, the university has partnered with Kylemore Abbey, renovating spaces in the abbey so it could host academic programs.
*&quot;Jerusalem&quot;. The Jerusalem Global Gateway shares space with the university&#x27;s Tantur Ecumenical Institute, in a facility on the seam between Jerusalem and Bethlehem. It hosts religious and ecumenical programs.
*&quot;Rome&quot;. The Rome Global Gateway is on Via Ostilia, very close to the Colosseum. It was recently acquired and renovated and now has of space to host a variety of academic activities. The university purchased a second Roman villa on the Caelian hill.

In addition to the five Global Gateways, the university also owns the Santa Fe Building in Chicago, where it offers its executive Master of Business Administration program. The university also hosts Global Centers located in Santiago, São Paulo, Mexico City, Hong Kong, and Mumbai.

===Community development===
The first phase of Eddy Street Commons, a $215 million development adjacent to campus funded by the university, broke ground in June 2008. The project drew union protests when workers hired by the City of South Bend to construct the public parking garage picketed the private work site after a contractor hired non-union workers. The $90 million second phase broke ground in 2017.

==Organization and administration==
The university&#x27;s president is always a priest of the Congregation of Holy Cross. The first president was Edward Sorin; and the current president is Robert A. Dowd. , John McGreevy is the provost overseeing academic functions.
Until 1967, Notre Dame had been governed directly by the Congregation. Under the presidency of Theodore Hesburgh, two groups, the Board of Fellows, and the Board of Trustees, were established to govern the university. The 12 fellows are evenly divided between members of the Holy Cross order and the laity; they have final say over the operation of the university. They vote on potential trustees and sign off on all that board&#x27;s major decisions. The trustees elect the president and provide general guidance and governance to the university.

===Endowment===
Notre Dame&#x27;s endowment was started in the early 1920s by university president James Burns; it was $7 million by 1952 when Hesburgh became president. In fiscal year ending in 2021, the university endowment market value was $18.07 billion. For fiscal year 2023, the university reported total endowment assets of $16.62 billion.

==Academics==
===Colleges and schools===
*The College of Arts and Letters was established as the university&#x27;s first college in 1842. The first degrees were granted seven years later. The university&#x27;s first academic curriculum was modeled after the Jesuit &quot;Ratio Studiorum&quot; from Saint Louis University. Today, the college, housed in O&#x27;Shaughnessy Hall, includes 20 departments in the areas of fine arts, humanities, and social sciences, and awards Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degrees in nearly 70 majors and minors, making it the largest of the university&#x27;s colleges. As of 2022, there were 2,000 undergraduates and graduates enrolled in the college, taught by 500 faculty members.

*The College of Science was established in 1865. The curriculum involved six years of coursework, including higher-level mathematics. Today, the college, housed in the Jordan Hall of Science, includes over 1,200 undergraduates in several departments, each awarding Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees. According to university statistics, its science pre-professional program has one of the highest acceptance rates to medical school of any university in the United States.
*The Notre Dame Law School was established in 1869 and is the oldest law program at a Catholic university in the United States. In 2024, the school ranked 20th among the top American law schools by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. The law school grants the professional Juris Doctor degree, as well as the graduate Master of Laws, and Doctor of Juridical Science degrees. It was ranked fourth in graduates attaining federal judicial clerkships in 2024, and seventh in graduates attaining Supreme Court clerkships in 2020.

*The School of Architecture was established in 1899, the year after Notre Dame first granted degrees in the field. Today, the school, housed in Walsh Family Hall of Architecture, offers a five-year undergraduate program leading to a bachelor&#x27;s degree. All undergraduates spend their third year in Rome. The faculty teaches (pre-modernist) traditional and classical architecture and urban planning (e.g., following the principles of New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture). It also awards the annual Driehaus Architecture Prize.
*The College of Engineering was established in 1920; however, courses in civil and mechanical engineering had been taught in the College of Science, since the 1870s. Today, the college, housed in the Fitzpatrick, Cushing, and Stinson-Remick Halls of Engineering, includes five departments of study, with eight B.S. degrees offered. The college also offers five-year dual degree programs with the College of Arts and Letters and the College of Business awarding additional B.A. and Master of Business Administration (MBA) degrees, respectively.
*The Mendoza College of Business was established in 1921 by John Francis O&#x27;Hara, although a foreign commerce program had been launched in 1917. Today, the college offers degrees in accountancy, finance, management, and marketing and enrolls over 1,600 students. In 2016, &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; ranked Mendoza&#x27;s undergraduate program as second in the country, after five consecutive years in the first position. For its 2023 ranking, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked the graduate school 25th, tied with Vanderbilt University.
*The Keough School of Global Affairs was established in 2014. The first new school in nearly a century, it builds on the presence of seven institutes founded for international research, scholarship, and education at Notre Dame. The school offers six doctoral programs related to international peace studies, a Masters in Global Affairs focused on either peace studies or sustainable development, and five undergraduate majors. It is focused on the study of global governance, human rights, and other areas of global social and political policy. A $50 million gift from Donald Keough, a former Coca-Cola executive, and his wife Marilyn funded the school&#x27;s creation. The school opened officially in August 2017, in Jenkins Hall on Debartolo Quad.

====Special programs====
Every Notre Dame undergraduate is part of one of the school&#x27;s five undergraduate colleges or is in the First Year of Studies program. The First Year of Studies program was established in 1962 to guide freshmen through their first year at the school before they have declared a major. Each student is assigned an academic advisor who helps them choose classes that give them exposure to any major in which they are interested. The program includes a Learning Resource Center, which provides time management, collaborative learning, and subject tutoring. First Year of Studies is designed to encourage intellectual and academic achievement and innovation among first-year students. It includes programs such as FY advising, the Dean&#x27;s A-list, the Renaissance circle, NDignite, the First Year Urban challenge, and more. Every admissions cycle, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions selects a small number of students for the Glynn Family Honors Program, which grants top students within the College of Arts and Letters and the College of Science access to smaller class sizes taught by distinguished faculty, endowed funding for independent research, and dedicated advising faculty and staff.

===Graduate education===
Each college offers graduate education in the form of master&#x27;s and doctoral programs. Most of the departments in the College of Arts and Letters offer PhDs, while a professional Master of Divinity (M.Div.) program also exists. All of the departments in the College of Science offer PhDs, except for the Department of Pre-Professional Studies. The School of Architecture offers a Master of Architecture, while each of the departments of the College of Engineering offer PhDs. The College of Business offers multiple professional programs, including MBA and Master of Science in Accountancy programs. It also operates facilities in Chicago and Cincinnati for its executive MBA program. The Alliance for Catholic Education program offers a Master of Education program, where students study at the university during the summer and teach in Catholic elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools across the South for two school years.
The university first offered graduate degrees, in the form of a Master of Arts (MA), in the 1854–1855 academic year. The program expanded to include Master of Laws (LLM) and Master of Civil Engineering in its early stages of growth, before a formal graduate school education was developed with a thesis not required to receive the degrees. This changed in 1924, with formal requirements developed for graduate degrees, including offering doctorates. Although Notre Dame does not have its own medical school, it offers a combined MD–PhD though the regional campus of the Indiana University School of Medicine, where Indiana medical students may spend the first two years of their medical education before transferring to the main medical campus at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis.

===Centers and institutes===
In 2019, Notre Dame announced plans to rename the Center for Ethics and Culture, an organization focused on spreading Catholic moral and intellectual traditions. The new A $10 million gift from Anthony and Christie funded the Center for Ethics and Culture. The university is also home to the McGrath Institute for Church Life, which &quot;partners with Catholic dioceses, parishes and schools to address pastoral challenges with theological depth and rigor&quot;. The Joan B. Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, founded in 1986 through donations Joan B. Kroc, the surviving spouse of McDonald&#x27;s owner Ray Kroc, and inspired by Father Hesburgh, is dedicated to research, education, and outreach, on the causes of violent conflict and the conditions for sustainable peace. It offers Ph.D., master&#x27;s, and undergraduate degrees in peace studies. It has contributed to international policy discussions about peace building practices.

===Libraries===

The university&#x27;s library system is divided between the main library, the 14-story Theodore M. Hesburgh Library, and each of the colleges and schools. The Hesburgh Library, completed in 1963, is the third building to house the main collection. The &quot;Word of Life&quot; mural by Millard Sheets, popularly known as &quot;Touchdown Jesus&quot; because of its proximity to Notre Dame Stadium and Jesus&#x27; arms appearing to make the signal for a touchdown, adorns the front of the library.

The library system also includes branch libraries for Architecture, Chemistry and Physics, Engineering, Law, Music, and Mathematics and information centers in the Mendoza College of Business, the Kellogg Institute for International Studies, the Joan B. Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, and a slide library in O&#x27;Shaughnessy Hall. A theology library, opened in the fall of 2015 on the first floor of Stanford Hall, is the first branch of the library system to be housed in a dorm room. With over three million volumes, the library system was the single largest university library in the world at the time of completion. It remains one of the hundred largest libraries in the country.

===Admissions===
The fall 2024 incoming class admitted 3,324 from a pool of 29,943 applicants for 11.1 percent acceptance rate. The university practices a non-restrictive early action policy that allows admitted students to consider admission to Notre Dame and any other colleges that accepted them. This process admitted 1,675 of the 9,683 (17 percent) who requested it. Admission is need-blind for domestic applicants. Admitted students came from 1,311 high schools; the average student traveled over to Notre Dame. While all entering students begin in the College of the First Year of Studies, 26 percent have indicated they plan to study in the liberal arts or social sciences, 21 percent in engineering, 26 percent in business, 24 percent in science, and 3 percent in architecture.

=== Tuition ===
Tuition for full-time students at the University of Notre Dame in 2023 is $62,693 a year. Room and board is estimated to be an additional $17,378 a year for students who live in campus housing. Notre Dame is a private university, so it offers the same tuition for in-state and out-of-state students.

==Research==

Joseph Carrier, director of the Science Museum and the library, was a professor of chemistry and physics until 1874. Carrier taught that scientific research and its promise for progress were not antagonistic to the ideals of intellectual and moral culture endorsed by the Catholic Church. Notable researchers in the early history of the university include John Augustine Zahm, whose book book &quot;Evolution and Dogma&quot; (1896) defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true; Albert Zahm, John&#x27;s brother, who built an early wind tunnel to compare lift to drag of aeronautical models; Jerome Green, who became the first American to send a wireless message; and Julius Nieuwland, who performed early work on basic reactions that were used to create neoprene. The study of nuclear physics at the university began with the building of a nuclear accelerator in 1936, and continues now partly through a partnership in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics.

The rise of Hitler and other dictators in the 1930s forced many Catholic intellectuals to flee Europe; President John O&#x27;Hara brought many of them to Notre Dame. Anton-Hermann Chroust, in classics and law, and Waldemar Gurian, a German Catholic intellectual of Jewish descent, came from Germany. Ivan Meštrović, a renowned sculptor, brought Croat culture to campus. Yves Simon brought the insights of French studies in the Aristotelian-Thomistic tradition of philosophy to the university in the 1940s; his teacher, Jacques Maritain, was a frequent visitor to campus. The exiles developed a distinctive emphasis on the evils of totalitarianism.
Richard T. Sullivan taught English from 1936 to 1974 and published six novels, dozens of short stories, and other works. Frank O&#x27;Malley was an English professor during the 1930s–1960s, who developed a concept of Christian philosophy that was a fundamental element in his thought. In 1939, Waldemar Gurian founded &quot;The Review of Politics&quot;, which quickly emerged as part of an international Catholic intellectual revival, offering an alternative vision to positivist philosophy. The College of Arts and Letters is distinguished for its contributions in the field of theology and religious studies, while its affiliated Medieval Institute is the largest center for medieval studies in North America.
The university has many multi-disciplinary research institutes, including the Medieval Institute, the Kellogg Institute for International Studies, the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, and the Center for Social Concerns. Recent research includes work on family conflict and child development, genome mapping, the increasing trade deficit of the United States with China, studies in fluid mechanics, computational science and engineering, supramolecular chemistry, and marketing trends on the Internet. , the university was home to the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index, which ranks countries annually based on how vulnerable they are to climate change and how prepared they are to adapt.

In the fiscal 2019, the university received the all-time high research funding of $180.6 million, an increase of $100 million from 2009 and a 27 percent increase from the previous year, with funded projects including vector-borne diseases, urbanism, environmental design, cancer, psychology, economics, philosophy of religion, particle physics, nanotechnology, and hypersonics. Notre Dame has a strong background in the humanities, with 65 National Endowment for the Humanities fellowships, more than any other university. Focus areas include anti-poverty economic strategy, the premier Medieval Institute, Latino studies, sacred music, Italian studies, Catholic studies, psychology, aging and stress, social good, and theology. In the sciences, research focuses and specialized centers include the Harper Cancer Research Institute, the Boler-Parseghian Center for Rare and Neglected Diseases, the Center for Nano Science and Technology, the Center for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, the Eck Institute for Global Health, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics, the University of Notre Dame Environmental Research Center, Topology and Quantum Field Theory, the Nuclear Physics Research Group, and the Environmental Change Initiative.

==Student life==

As of Fall 2022, the Notre Dame student body consisted of 8,958 undergraduates and 4,134 graduate and professional (Law, M.Div., Business, MEd) students. An estimated 21–24 percent of students are children of alumni, and the student body represents all 50 states and 88 countries. Thirty-seven percent of students come from the Midwestern United States, and 40 percent of students are U.S. students of color, eight percent are international citizens. 

===Residence halls===

The residence halls, or dorms, are the focus of student social and intramural life. Each hall is led by a rector, a full-time, live-in professional who serves as leader, chief administrator, community builder and university resource to the residents, and is a priest, religious sister or brother, or a layperson trained in ministry or education. Rectors direct the hall community, foster bonding, and often coordinate with professors, academic advisors, and counselors to watch over students and assist them with their personal development. Rectors select, hire, train, and supervise hall staff: resident assistants (required to be seniors) and assistant rectors (graduate students). Many residence halls also have a priest or faculty members in residence as faculty fellows, who provide an additional academic and intellectual experience to residential hall life. Every hall has its own chapel, dedicated to the hall&#x27;s patron saint, and liturgical schedule with masses celebrated multiple times a week during the academic year, in the tradition of individual chapels at English university colleges.

Fraternities and sororities are not allowed on campus, as they are described as in opposition to the university&#x27;s educational and residential mission. The residential halls provide the social and communal aspect of fraternities, but in line with the university&#x27;s policy of inclusion and zero tolerance of hazing.

Over four-fifths of students live in the same residence hall for three consecutive years and about one-third of students live in the same residence hall for all four years . A new policy was put into effect beginning in 2018, which required undergraduates to live on-campus for three years. In spring 2019, the university also announced a policy (that has since been reversed) that prohibited students living off campus from participating in dorm activities, such as intramural sports and dorm dances. Most intramural (interhall) sports are based on residence hall teams, where the university offers the only non-military academy program of full-contact intramural American football. At the end of the interhall football season, the championship game is played in Notre Dame Stadium.

===Student clubs===
There are over 400 active student clubs at the University of Notre Dame, with the financial oversight of each club delegated by the student-run Club Coordination Council. The university subsidizes clubs, providing almost 15 percent of clubs&#x27; collective projected expenditures of $2.2 million during the 2018–2019 academic year. There are a variety of student clubs on campus, including nine for students from different states, about three dozen clubs that represent different nationalities and origins, and clubs dedicated to Catholic theology, diverse faith practices, social service, political advocacy and awareness, competitive athletics, professional development and networking, performing arts, academic debate, foreign affairs, fraternal brotherhood, women&#x27;s empowerment, and many other interests. The university hosts their annual Student Activities Fair early in the fall semester for all students interested in joining clubs or other student organizations.

====Student union====

The Notre Dame Club Coordination Council (or simply the Club Coordination Council (CCC)) is the branch of the Student Union of the university responsible for communicating issues facing undergraduate club issues, providing funding for undergraduate clubs, serving as the representative body of undergraduate student clubs, and working with student clubs to ensure that clubs can coordinate their programming of activities. The CCC oversees around 400 student clubs, each of which serves a unique purpose. The approval of the council, along with that of the Notre Dame Student Activities Office, is a requirement for official recognition of student clubs.

===Student events===
Website BestColleges.com ranks the university&#x27;s intramural sports program as number one in the country in 2021. Over 700 teams participate each year in the annual Bookstore Basketball tournament; while the Notre Dame Men&#x27;s Boxing Club hosts the annual Bengal Bouts tournament to raise money for the Holy Cross Missions in Bangladesh. In the fall, the Notre Dame Women&#x27;s Boxing Club hosts an annual Baraka Bouts tournament that raises money for the Congregation of the Holy Cross Missions in Uganda.

Many of the most popular student events held on campus are organized by the 30 residential halls. Among these, the most notable are the Keenan Revue, the Fisher Hall Regatta, Howard Hall Totter for Water, Keenan Hall Muddy Sunday, the Morrissey Hall Medallion Hunt, the Dillon Hall Pep Rally, the Keough Hall Chariot Race and many others. Each dorm also hosts many formal and informal balls and dances each year.

===Religious life===

While having a religious affiliation is not a criterion for admission, over 93 percent of students identify as Christian, with over 80 percent of those being Catholic. There are 57 chapels on campus, including one in every residence hall. Collectively, Catholic Mass is celebrated over 100 times per week on campus, and a large campus ministry program provides for the faith needs of the community. There is also an active council of the Knights of Columbus on campus, which is the oldest and largest college council of the international Catholic men&#x27;s organization. Non-Catholic religious organizations on campus include the Baptist Collegiate Ministry (BCM), Jewish Club of Notre Dame, the Muslim Student Association, the Orthodox Christian Fellowship, the Chi Alpha Christian Fellowship, and many more.

The university is the major seat of the Congregation of Holy Cross (albeit not its official headquarters, which are in Rome). Its main seminary, Moreau Seminary, is on the campus across St. Joseph Lake from the Main Building. Old College, the oldest building on campus near the shore of St. Mary&#x27;s Lake, houses undergraduate seminarians. Retired priests and brothers reside in Fatima House (a former retreat center), Holy Cross House, and Columba Hall near the Grotto.

===Student-run media===
Notre Dame students run nine media outlets: three newspapers, a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals.

The &quot;Scholastic&quot; magazine, begun as a one-page journal in 1876, is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, &quot;The Juggler&quot;, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The &quot;Dome&quot; yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with &quot;The Observer&quot; published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary&#x27;s College. Unlike &quot;Scholastic&quot; and &quot;The Dome&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot; is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the university. In 2003, when other students believed that the paper had a liberal bias, they started &quot;The&quot; &quot;Irish Rover&quot;, a print and digital newspaper published twice per month that features regular columns from alumni and faculty and coverage of campus matters. As of 2005, &quot;The Observer&quot; and the &quot;Irish Rover&quot; were distributed to all students. In Spring 2008, &quot;Beyond Politics&quot;, an undergraduate journal for political science research, made its debut. In May 2023, a professor at the university, Tamara Kay, sued the Rover for defamation. The case was dismissed, and Kay filed an appeal in February 2024.

WSND-FM serves the student body and the larger South Bend community at 88.9 FM, offering students a chance to become involved in bringing classical music, fine arts and educational programming, and alternative rock to the airwaves. Another radio station, WVFI, began as a partner of WSND-FM; it now airs independently and is streamed on the Internet.

The television station NDtv grew from one show in 2002 to a full 24-hour channel with original programming by 2006.

==Athletics==
Notre Dame&#x27;s sports teams are known as the Fighting Irish. They compete as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I, primarily competing in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) for all sports—except football and hockey —since the 2013–14 school year. Men&#x27;s ice hockey is played in the Big Ten conference. Notre Dame men compete in baseball, basketball, cross country, fencing, football, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis and track and field; women&#x27;s sports are basketball, cross country, fencing, golf, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, and volleyball. The football team competes as a Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) Independent since its inception in 1887, except for 2020, when it competed as part of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Both fencing teams compete in the Midwest Fencing Conference. 

Notre Dame&#x27;s sports conference affiliations, except football and fencing, changed in July 2013 because of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation changed in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to playing five games per season against ACC opponents. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year.

There are many theories behind the adoption of the team name but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team, and alumnus Francis Wallace popularized it in his &quot;New York Daily News&quot; columns. Notre Dame&#x27;s official colors are navy blue and gold. Green is sometimes worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname.

The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later the football program covers. &quot;Time&quot; featured it on a November 1964 cover. Since its inception in 2011, Fighting Irish Media (FIM), made up of part-time student workers and full time producers, has filmed nearly all Fighting Irish sporting events for live digital and linear broadcasts. With the installation of a videoboard in Notre Dame Stadium in Fall 2017, FIM has taken over video board production for all Fighting Irish teams. In 2014, the University of Notre Dame and Under Armour reached an agreement whereby the company provides uniforms, apparel, equipment, and monetary compensation to Notre Dame for 10 years. This contract, worth almost $100 million, was the most lucrative in the history of the NCAA at that time. According to some analysts, without direct connection to the university or its athletic department, Notre Dame promotes Muscular Christianity through its athletic programs.

===Football===
The Notre Dame football team&#x27;s history began when the Michigan team brought the game to Notre Dame in 1887 and played against a group of students. Since then, 13 Fighting Irish teams have won consensus national championships (although the university only claims 11), along with another nine teams being named national champions by at least one source. The program has the most members in the College Football Hall of Fame, is tied with Ohio State for the most Heisman Trophies won by players, and has the 3rd highest winning percentage in NCAA history, behind Ohio State and Alabama. Notre Dame has accumulated many rivals; the annual game against USC for the Jeweled Shillelagh has been described as one of the greatest in college football.

George Gipp was the school&#x27;s legendary football player of the late 1910s. In 1928, coach Knute Rockne used his final conversation with the dying Gipp to inspire the Notre Dame team to beat Army and &quot;win one for the Gipper&quot;; that scene became the climax of the 1940 film &quot;Knute Rockne, All American&quot;, starring Pat O&#x27;Brien as Rockne and Ronald Reagan as Gipp.

The team competes in the 80,795-seat Notre Dame Stadium. The current head coach is Marcus Freeman, who was promoted to head coach after Brian Kelly departed Notre Dame to coach at LSU at the end of the 2021 regular season. Forbes ranked the program college football&#x27;s eighth most valuable for its average annual revenue of $120 million. It has a TV contract with NBC worth an estimated $15 million per year and one of the country&#x27;s largest fan bases.

====Football game-day traditions====
During home games, activities occur all over campus and dorms decorate their halls with a traditional item (e.g., Zahm Hall&#x27;s two-story banner). Traditional activities begin at midnight with the Drummers&#x27; Circle, involving the Band of the Fighting Irish&#x27;s drumline beginning the other festivities that will continue the rest of the game day. Later that day, the trumpet section will play the Notre Dame Victory March and the Notre Dame Alma Mater under the dome. The entire band will play a concert at the steps of Bond Hall, then march into the stadium, leading fans and students alike across campus to the game. At the end of each game, the Notre Dame Marching Band plays the alma mater.

===Men&#x27;s basketball===
As of the 2020–2021 season, the men&#x27;s basketball team has over 1,910 wins and appeared in 36 NCAA tournaments Former player Austin Carr holds the record for most points scored in a single game of the tournament with 61. Although the team has never won the NCAA Tournament, they were named by the Helms Athletic Foundation as national champions twice. The team has orchestrated a number of upsets of top-ranked teams, the most notable of which was ending UCLA&#x27;s record 88-game winning streak in 1974. Notre Dame has beaten an additional eight number-one teams, and those nine wins rank second, to UCLA&#x27;s 10, all-time in wins against the top team.

===Other sports===

Notre Dame has won an additional 15 national championships in sports other than football. Four teams have won multiple national championships; the fencing team leads with 10, followed by the men&#x27;s lacrosse, men&#x27;s tennis, and women&#x27;s soccer teams with two each. The men&#x27;s cross country and golf teams have won one and Notre Dame women&#x27;s basketball has won two. In the first 10 years that Notre Dame competed in the Big East Conference its teams won a total of 64 championships. , the women&#x27;s swimming and diving team holds the Big East record for consecutive conference championships in any sport with 14 straight conference titles (1997–2010).

===Band and &quot;Victory March&quot;===
The Band of the Fighting Irish was formed in 1846 and is the oldest university band in continuous existence. The marching band plays at home games for most sports. It regularly plays the school&#x27;s fight song, the Notre Dame &quot;Victory March&quot;, identified as the most played and most famous fight song by Northern Illinois professor William Studwell. According to &quot;College Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology&quot; published in 1998, the &quot;Victory March&quot; is the greatest fight song. It was honored by the National Music Council as a &quot;Landmark of American Music&quot; during the United States Bicentennial. The song is featured in the films &quot;Knute Rockne, All American&quot;, &quot;Airplane!&quot; and &quot;Rudy&quot;.

==Alumni==
The school has over 130,000 alumni and 275 alumni clubs around the world. Notre Dame is ranked among the universities with strongest alumni networks. Many give the university yearly monetary support. Notre Dame is ranked among schools with the highest alumni donation rates. A school-record of 53.2 percent of alumni donating was set in 2006. Many buildings, including residence halls, on campus are named for major donors. Classroom buildings, and the performing arts center are also named for donors.

Alumni working in politics include state governors, members of the United States Congress, and former United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Notable alumni from the College of Science are Eric F. Wieschaus, winner of the 1995 Nobel Prize in medicine, and Philip Majerus, discoverer of the cardioprotective effects of aspirin. Many university officials are alumni, including the current president, John Jenkins and incoming President Robert Dowd, a professor of Political Science who specializes in African Studies. Alumni in media include talk show hosts Regis Philbin and Phil Donahue, and television and radio personalities such as Mike Golic and Hannah Storm.

Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819), was a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that defined the scope of the U.S. Congress&#x27;s legislative power and how it relates to the powers of American state legislatures. The dispute in &quot;McCulloch&quot; involved the legality of the national bank and a tax that the state of Maryland imposed on it. In its ruling, the Supreme Court established firstly that the &quot;Necessary and Proper&quot; Clause of the U.S. Constitution gives the U.S. federal government certain implied powers necessary and proper for the exercise of the powers enumerated explicitly in the Constitution, and secondly that the American federal government is supreme over the states, and so states&#x27; ability to interfere with the federal government is restricted. Since the legislature has the authority to tax and spend, the court held that it therefore has authority to establish a national bank, as being &quot;necessary and proper&quot; to that end.

The state of Maryland had attempted to impede an operation by the Second Bank of the United States through a tax on all notes of banks not chartered in Maryland. Though the law, by its language, was generally applicable to all banks not chartered in Maryland, the Second Bank of the United States was the only out-of-state bank then existing in Maryland, and the law was thus recognized in the court&#x27;s opinion as having specifically targeted the Bank of the United States. The Court invoked the Necessary and Proper Clause of the Constitution, which allows the federal government to pass laws not expressly provided for in the Constitution&#x27;s list of enumerated powers of Congress if such laws are necessary and proper to further the powers expressly authorized.

&quot;McCulloch&quot; has been described as &quot;the most important Supreme Court decision in American history defining the scope of Congress&#x27;s powers and delineating the relationship between the federal government and the states.&quot; The case established two important principles in constitutional law. First, the Constitution grants to Congress implied powers to implement the Constitution&#x27;s express powers to create a functional national government. Prior to the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;McCulloch&quot;, the scope of the U.S. government&#x27;s authority was unclear. Second, state action may not impede valid constitutional exercises of power by the federal government.

==Background==

Almost immediately after the ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1788, a major public debate arose over whether to establish a national bank for the United States. Upon George Washington&#x27;s inauguration in 1789 as the first President of the United States, his Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, proposed creating a national bank to regulate American currency and deal with national economic problems. Washington&#x27;s Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, strongly opposed the bank&#x27;s creation, fearing it would usurp power from the individual states and concentrate it to a dangerous degree in the central federal government. Congress created the First Bank of the United States in 1791 with a 20-year charter, but the issue continued to be controversial. Those who supported Hamilton&#x27;s vision of a stronger central government eventually formed the Federalist Party, while those who opposed him and supported Jefferson&#x27;s vision of a decentralized government that focused on states&#x27; rights formed the Democratic-Republican Party.

The First Bank&#x27;s charter expired in 1811 and was not renewed. However, national economic problems in the aftermath of the War of 1812 prompted Congress to pass similar legislation in 1816 to create the Second Bank of the United States. The U.S. government only owned 20 percent of the bank&#x27;s equity, and many state governments resented the bank for calling in loans it had made to them. Consequently, some states passed laws designed to hinder the bank&#x27;s operation, while others simply tried to tax it. In 1818, the Maryland General Assembly—Maryland&#x27;s state legislature—passed a law levying a $15,000 annual tax on any bank operating in Maryland that was issuing notes and bills that were not properly stamped by Maryland&#x27;s Treasury, the Western Shore Treasury.

James William McCulloh, a cashier of the Baltimore Branch of the Second Bank of the United States, issued unstamped bank notes to Baltimore resident George Williams. The lawsuit was filed by John James, an informer who sought to collect half of the fine, as provided for by the statute. The Bank was represented by Daniel Webster. The case was appealed to the Maryland Court of Appeals, where the state of Maryland argued that &quot;the Constitution is silent on the subject of banks.&quot; It was Maryland&#x27;s contention that without specific constitutional authorization for the federal government to create a bank, any such creation would be rendered unconstitutional.

The court upheld Maryland. The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court.

==Decision==

The Court determined that Congress had the power to create the Bank. Chief Justice Marshall supported his conclusion with four main arguments:

Firstly, he argued that historical practice established Congress&#x27;s power to create the bank. Marshall invoked the creation of the First Bank of the United States in 1791 as authority for the constitutionality of the second bank. The first Congress had enacted the bank after great debate, and it was approved by an executive &quot;with as much persevering talent as any measure has ever experienced, and being supported by arguments which convinced minds as pure and as intelligent as this country can boast.&quot;

Secondly, Marshall rebutted the argument that states retain ultimate sovereignty because they ratified the constitution: &quot;The powers of the general government, it has been said, are delegated by the states, who alone are truly sovereign; and must be exercised in subordination to the states, who alone possess supreme dominion.&quot; Marshall contended that it was the people who ratified the Constitution and thus the people, not the states, who are sovereign.

Thirdly, Marshall addressed the scope of congressional powers under Article I. The Court broadly described Congress&#x27;s authority before it addressed the Necessary and Proper Clause. Marshall admitted that the Constitution does not enumerate a power to create a central Bank but said that is not dispositive as to Congress&#x27;s power to establish such an institution: &quot;In considering this question, then, we must never forget, that it is a &quot;constitution&quot; we are expounding.&quot;

Fourthly, Marshall supported his opinion textually by invoking the Necessary and Proper Clause, which permits Congress to seek an objective while it exercised its enumerated powers as long as that objective is not forbidden by the Constitution. In liberally interpreting the Necessary and Proper Clause, the Court rejected Maryland&#x27;s narrow interpretation of the clause that the word &quot;necessary&quot; in the clause meant that Congress could pass only laws that were absolutely essential in the execution of its enumerated powers. The Court rejected that argument, on the grounds that many of the enumerated powers of Congress under the Constitution would be useless if only laws deemed essential to a power&#x27;s execution could be passed. Marshall also noted that the Necessary and Proper Clause is listed within the powers of Congress, not its limitations.

The Court held that the word &quot;necessary&quot; in the Necessary and Proper Clause does not refer therefore to the only way of doing something but applies to various procedures for implementing all constitutionally-established powers: &quot;Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are Constitutional.&quot;

That principle had been established many years earlier by Alexander Hamilton:

Chief Justice Marshall also determined that Maryland could not tax the bank without violating the constitution since, as Marshall commented, &quot;the power to tax involves the power to destroy&quot;. The Court thus struck down the tax as an unconstitutional attempt by a state to interfere with a federal institution, in violation of the Supremacy Clause.

The opinion stated that Congress has implied powers, which must be related to the text of the Constitution but do not need to be enumerated within the text.

==Significance==
The case was a seminal moment in federalism: the formation of a balance between federal powers and state powers. Marshall also explained in the case that the Necessary and Proper Clause does not require all federal laws to be necessary and proper and that federal laws that are enacted directly pursuant to one of the expressed, enumerated powers granted by the Constitution do not need to comply with the Necessary and Proper Clause, which &quot;purport[s] to enlarge, not to diminish the powers vested in the government. It purports to be an additional power, not a restriction on those already granted.&quot;

==Criticism==
Though Marshall rejected the Tenth Amendment&#x27;s provision of states&#x27; rights arguing that it did not include the word &quot;expressly,&quot; unlike the Articles of Confederation, which the Constitution replaced, controversy over the authority of the amendment being violated by the decision has existed. Compact theory also argues that the federal government is a creation of the states and that the states maintain superiority. Unlike Marshall, his successor, Roger B. Taney, established dual federalism by which separate-but-equal branches of government are believed to be a better option.

==Later history==
&quot;McCulloch v. Maryland&quot; was cited in the first substantial constitutional case presented before the High Court of Australia in &quot;D&#x27;Emden v Pedder&quot; (1904), which dealt with similar issues in the Australian Federation. While recognizing American law as not binding on them, the Australian Court nevertheless determined that the &quot;McCulloch&quot; decision provided the best guideline for the relationship between the Commonwealth federal government, and the Australian states, owing in large part to strong similarities between the American and Australian constitutions.

<doc id="146271" wikidata="Q3196738" url="?curid=146271" title="Dartmouth College v. Woodward">
<text>Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 518 (1819), was a landmark decision in United States corporate law from the United States Supreme Court dealing with the application of the Contracts Clause of the United States Constitution to private corporations. The case arose when the president of Dartmouth College was deposed by its trustees, leading to the New Hampshire legislature attempting to force the college to become a public institution and thereby place the ability to appoint trustees in the hands of the governor of New Hampshire. The Supreme Court upheld the sanctity of the original charter of the college, which predated the creation of the State.

The decision settled the nature of public versus private charters and resulted in the rise of the American business corporation and the American free enterprise system.

==Background==
In 1769, King George III of Great Britain granted a charter to Dartmouth College that spelled out the purpose of the school, set up the structure to govern it, and gave it land. In 1816, over 30 years after the conclusion of the American Revolution, the New Hampshire legislature altered Dartmouth&#x27;s charter in order to reinstate the College&#x27;s deposed president, place the ability to appoint positions in the hands of the governor, add new members to the board of trustees, and create a state-controlled board of visitors with veto power over trustee decisions. This effectively converted the school from a private to a public institution. The College&#x27;s book of records, corporate seal, and other corporate property were removed. The trustees of the College objected and sought to have the actions of the legislature declared unconstitutional.

The trustees retained Dartmouth alumnus Daniel Webster, a New Hampshire lawyer who later became a U.S. Senator for Massachusetts and Secretary of State under President Millard Fillmore. Webster argued the college&#x27;s case against William H. Woodward, the state-approved secretary of the new board of trustees. Webster&#x27;s speech in support of Dartmouth (which he called &quot;a small college,&quot; adding, &quot;and yet there are those who love it&quot;) was reportedly so moving that it helped convince Chief Justice John Marshall and almost brought Marshall to tears, according to the later recollection of attendant Chauncey A. Goodrich.

==Judgment==
The decision, handed down on February 2, 1819, ruled in favor of the college and invalidated the act of the New Hampshire Legislature, which in turn allowed Dartmouth to continue as a private institution and take back its buildings, seal, and charter. The majority opinion of the court was written by Marshall. The opinion reaffirmed Marshall&#x27;s belief in the sanctity of a contract (also seen in &quot;Fletcher v. Peck&quot;) as necessary to the functioning of a republic (in the absence of royal rule, contracts rule).

The Court ruled that the college&#x27;s corporate charter qualified as a contract between private parties, the King and the trustees, with which the legislature could not interfere. Even though the United States were no longer royal colonies, the contract was still valid because the Constitution said that a state could not pass laws to impair a contract. The fact that the government had commissioned the charter did not transform the school into a civil institution. Marshall&#x27;s opinion emphasized that the term &quot;contract&quot; referred to transactions involving individual property rights, not to &quot;the political relations between the government and its citizens.&quot;

==Significance==
The decision was not without precedent; the Court had invalidated a state act in &quot;Fletcher v. Peck&quot; (1810), concluding that contracts, no matter how they were procured (in that case, a land contract had been illegally obtained), cannot be invalidated by state legislation. &quot;Fletcher&quot; was not a popular decision at the time, and a public outcry ensued. Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s earlier commiseration with New Hampshire Governor William Plumer stated essentially that the earth belongs to the living. Popular opinion influenced some state courts and legislatures to declare that state governments had an absolute right to amend or repeal a corporate charter. The courts, however, have imposed limitations on this.

After the Dartmouth decision, many states wanted more control, so they passed laws or constitutional amendments giving themselves the general right to alter or revoke at will, which the courts found to be a valid reservation. But the courts had established that the alteration or revocation of private charters or laws authorizing private charters must be reasonable and cannot cause harm to the members (founders, stockholders, and the like).

The traditional view is that this case is one of the most important Supreme Court rulings, strengthening the Contracts Clause and limiting the power of the States to interfere with private charters, including those of commercial enterprises.

Virginia, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264 (1821), is a landmark case by the Supreme Court of the United States that is most notable for the Court&#x27;s assertion of its power to review state supreme court decisions in criminal law matters if defendants claim that their constitutional rights have been violated. The Court had previously asserted a similar jurisdiction over civil cases involving U.S. parties (see &quot;Martin v. Hunter&#x27;s Lessee&quot;).

The defendants were members of a prominent Baltimore banking family. A U.S. senator and two U.S. representatives served as attorneys for the opposing sides. The two defendants, Mendes I. Cohen and Philip I. Cohen, would later rise to the positions of U.S. Army Colonel and Maryland Delegate (Mendes), and U.S. Postmaster (Philip).

==Background==

Congress passed a bill to establish a National Lottery to raise money for the District of Columbia that was conducted by the municipal government. Meanwhile, Virginia had established its own state lotteries and passed a law to prohibit the sale of out-of-state lottery tickets.

Philip and Mendes Cohen were brothers and managed the Norfolk, Virginia branch of Cohens Lottery and Exchange Office of Baltimore, Maryland. The Cohen firm was a leading vendor of lottery tickets in the United States through its offices in New York, Philadelphia, Charleston, and Norfolk and nationwide through the mail. The firm had a strong reputation in an otherwise-unsavory field and was known for quick payouts to winners. Their reputation helped the firm later become successful in the insurance and banking fields. The firm had been established in 1812 by an older brother, Jacob I. Cohen, Jr., who brought each of his five brothers into the firm. He later was elected to and served as a president of the Baltimore City Council.

On June 1, 1820, both Cohens were charged by authorities in Norfolk with selling tickets in Virginia for the National Lottery. The brothers were convicted in a local court and fined $100.

The issue was significant as &quot;lotteries were one of the chief means by which governments raised capital in the&quot; early 19th century. The case challenged the &quot;free flow of commerce&quot; embodied in the U.S. Constitution and could have emboldened other states to challenge the sale of National Lottery tickets in their jurisdictions.

The Cohens hired two of the country&#x27;s top lawyers for their appeal: U.S. Senator William Pinkney of Maryland and David A. Ogden, who had recently retired as a U.S. Representative from New York. Pinkney, an acquaintance of the Cohen family and a strong proponent of the necessary and proper clause and the doctrine of sovereign immunity, organized a public relations campaign on behalf of the federal government&#x27;s powers in this case.

==Judicial history==
The state courts found that the Virginia law prohibiting sale of out-of-state lotteries could be enforced, notwithstanding the act of Congress authorizing the D.C. lottery. The Cohens appealed to the United States Supreme Court by arguing that their conduct was protected by the Act of Congress authorizing the D.C. lottery.

The Supreme Court concluded with two opinions on this case that were published together. The first opinion, containing the major rulings of constitutional and historical significance, concerned Virginia&#x27;s motion to dismiss for purported lack of US Supreme Court jurisdiction. The ruling was issued on March 2, 1821, and asserted the Supreme Court&#x27;s constitutional right to jurisdiction in this case.

Having resolved the significant jurisdictional issues, the Court issued an opinion the next day on the merits of the case: it construed the Congressional statute as authorizing a lottery only in the City of Washington, District of Columbia. (At the time, the District of Columbia consisted of two cities, the other being Alexandria. In the 1840s, it was retroceded to the State of Virginia so that its major slave market could be operated outside the federal capital.) It upheld the convictions of the Cohens in Virginia.

The main issue in &quot;Cohens v. Virginia&quot; was the preliminary issue of whether the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to hear an appeal in a criminal case decided by the courts of Virginia. Virginia argued that the U.S. Constitution does not give the Supreme Court appellate jurisdiction over criminal judgments by the state courts. Virginia also argued that the U.S. Constitution does not give the Supreme Court appellate jurisdiction over cases in which a state is a party. In effect, Virginia argued that its decision was final and could not be reviewed by the federal courts even though the decision involved the interpretation and application of an act of Congress. Virginia asserted that it had an unreviewable right to interpret and apply federal law as it saw fit.

The Supreme Court relied on Article III, Section 2, of the U.S. Constitution, which grants the Supreme Court jurisdiction in &quot;all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority.&quot; The Court found that the U.S. Constitution provides no exceptions to this grant of jurisdiction for cases arising in the state courts or for cases in which a state is a party. Therefore, under its language, all cases arising under federal law are within its grant of appellate jurisdiction. That conclusion was reinforced by the Supremacy Clause of Article VI, which makes federal law superior to state law.

The Court stated that if state court decisions involving federal law were unreviewable by the federal courts, each state could prevent the federal government from executing federal laws in that state and thus allow each state a veto power over federal law. The Court found that to be inconsistent with the language and the intent of the U.S. Constitution, including the explicit grant of judicial power to the federal courts: 
The Court also said that unless state court decisions involving federal law could be reviewed by federal courts, there would be as many interpretations of federal law as there are states. Quoting &quot;Federalist No. 80,&quot; the Court found that the Constitution was not intended to create &quot;a hydra in government from which nothing but contradiction and confusion can proceed.&quot; Rather, relying on &quot;Federalist No. 82,&quot; the Court found that the framers intended for the Supreme Court to have appellate jurisdiction over state court cases involving federal law.

Accordingly, the Supreme Court found no restriction or limitation on the plain language of the Constitution granting it appellate jurisdiction over all cases arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States. The Court, therefore, had jurisdiction over the appeal from the Virginia courts.

Having found that it had jurisdiction, the Supreme Court upheld the Cohens&#x27; convictions. The Court found that Congress did not intend to authorize the sale of National Lottery tickets outside the District of Columbia. Therefore, there was no conflict between the act of Congress authorizing a lottery there and Virginia&#x27;s statute prohibiting sale of out-of-state lotteries within its boundaries.

<doc id="146273" wikidata="Q3308289" url="?curid=146273" title="Gibbons v. Ogden">
<text>Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1 (1824), was a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States which held that the power to regulate interstate commerce, which is granted to the US Congress by the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution, encompasses the power to regulate navigation. The decision is credited with supporting the economic growth of the antebellum United States and the creation of national markets. &quot;Gibbons v. Ogden&quot; has since provided the basis for Congress&#x27; regulation of railroads, freeways and television and radio broadcasts.

The case was argued by some of America&#x27;s most admired and capable attorneys at the time. The exiled Irish patriot Thomas Addis Emmet, as well as Thomas J. Oakley, argued for Ogden, and U.S. Attorney General William Wirt and Daniel Webster argued for Gibbons.

==Background==
In 1798, the New York State Legislature granted to Robert R. Livingston and Robert Fulton exclusive navigation privileges of all the waters within the jurisdiction of that state with boats moved by fire or steam for a term of 20 years. Livingston and Fulton subsequently also petitioned other states and territorial legislatures for similar monopolies in the hope of developing a national network of steamboat lines, but only the Orleans Territory accepted their petition; it awarded them a monopoly on the lower Mississippi River.

Aware of the potential of the new steamboat navigation, competitors challenged Livingston and Fulton by arguing that the commerce power of the federal government was exclusive and superseded state laws. Legal challenges followed, and in response, the monopoly attempted to undercut its rivals by selling them franchises or buying their boats. Former New Jersey Governor Aaron Ogden had tried to defy the monopoly but ultimately purchased a license from a Livingston and Fulton assignee in 1815 and entered business with Thomas Gibbons from Georgia. The partnership collapsed three years later, however, when Gibbons operated another steamboat on Ogden&#x27;s route between Elizabeth-town, New Jersey (now Elizabeth), and New York City, which had been licensed by the US Congress under a 1793 law regulating the coasting trade. The partners ended up in the New York Court for the Trial of Impeachments, which granted a permanent injunction against Gibbons in 1820.

==Case==
Ogden filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of New York to ask the court to restrain Gibbons from operating on those waters. Ogden&#x27;s lawyer contended that states often passed laws on issues regarding interstate matters and should have fully-concurrent power with Congress on matters concerning interstate commerce.

Gibbons&#x27;s lawyer, Daniel Webster, however, argued that Congress had exclusive national power over interstate commerce according to Article I, Section 8, Clause 3, of the US Constitution and that to argue otherwise would result in confusing and contradictory local regulatory policies. The Court of Chancery of New York and the Court of Errors of New York found in favor of Ogden and issued an injunction to restrict Gibbons from operating his boats.

Gibbons appealed to the Supreme Court and argued, as he had in New York, that the monopoly conflicted with federal law. After several delays, the court began discussing the meaning of the commerce clause in 1824, which had now become an issue of wider interest. Congress was debating a bill to provide a federal survey of roads and canals.

Southerners, in particular, were growing more sensitive to what result a holding for exclusive federal jurisdiction over commerce would mean to them as sectional disputes, especially over slavery, were increasing. Just 18 months prior to oral arguments in the &quot;Gibbons v. Ogden&quot; case, the people of Charleston, South Carolina, had been dismayed at the revelation of Denmark Vesey&#x27;s plotted slave revolt. The statehouse quickly followed up the preemptive suppression of the rebellion with the Negro Seamen Act, which required free black sailors on ships coming into the state to be jailed for the duration of the ship&#x27;s stay in port. The act was promptly struck down as unconstitutional by Associate Justice Johnson, who was riding federal circuit, on the ground that the act violated commercial treaty provisions with the United Kingdom. South Carolina emphatically rejected Johnson&#x27;s holding, and talk quickly emerged of nullification and violent disunion. To thread the needle in the &quot;Gibbons&quot; case, the Court would need to deliver a holding that both defended national power over interstate commerce but did not eradicate state police powers, which Southern whites viewed as vital to their very survival.

==Decision of Supreme Court==
The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Gibbons on the grounds that Congress has the right to regulate interstate commerce. The sole decided source of Congress&#x27;s power to promulgate the law at issue was the Commerce Clause. Accordingly, the Court had to answer whether the law regulated &quot;commerce&quot; that was &quot;among the several states.&quot; With respect to &quot;commerce,&quot; the Court held that commerce is more than mere traffic and is the trade of commodities, a broader definition that includes navigation. The Court interpreted &quot;among&quot; to mean &quot;intermingled with:&quot;

If, as has always been understood, the sovereignty of Congress, though limited to specified objects, is plenary as to those objects, the power over commerce with foreign nations and among the several States is vested in Congress as absolutely as it would be in a single government, having in its Constitution the same restrictions on the exercise of the power as are found in the Constitution of the United States.

The part of the ruling that stated that any license granted under the Federal Coasting Act of 1793 takes precedence over any similar license granted by a state is also in the spirit of the Supremacy Clause although the Court did not specifically cite that clause.

The Court did not discuss the argument pressed for Gibbons by U.S. Attorney General Wirt that the federal patent laws pre-empted New York&#x27;s patent grant to Fulton and Livingston. That question remained undecided for the next 140 years until the Supreme Court held in &quot;Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Stiffel Co.&quot; (1964) that federal patent law pre-empted similar state laws.

<doc id="146274" wikidata="Q5419197" url="?curid=146274" title="Ex parte Merryman">
<text>Ex parte Merryman, 17 F. Cas. 144 (C.C.D. Md. 1861) (No. 9487), was a controversial U.S. federal court case that arose out of the American Civil War. It was a test of the authority of the President to suspend &quot;the privilege of the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;&quot; under the Constitution&#x27;s Suspension Clause, when Congress was in recess and therefore unavailable to do so itself. More generally, the case raised questions about the ability of the executive branch to decline to enforce judicial decisions when the executive believes them to be erroneous and harmful to its own legal powers.

John Merryman was a prominent planter from Baltimore County, Maryland, who had been arrested at his rural plantation for destroying railroad bridges on which Union troops were traveling. Held prisoner in Fort McHenry in Baltimore harbor, he was kept inaccessible to the judiciary and to civilian legal authorities generally. U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney ruled in this case that the authority to suspend &quot;habeas corpus&quot; lay exclusively with Congress. Taney&#x27;s ruling was not a Supreme Court decision.

Taney filed his &quot;Merryman&quot; decision with the United States Circuit Court for the District of Maryland, but it is unclear if Taney&#x27;s decision was a circuit court decision. One view, based in part on Taney&#x27;s handwritten copy of his decision in &quot;Merryman&quot;, is that Taney heard the &quot;habeas action&quot; under special authority granted to federal judges by Section 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789. According to this view, &quot;Merryman&quot; was an in-chambers opinion. Due to its vague jurisdictional locus and hastened disposition, aspects of the &quot;Merryman&quot; decision remain contested to this day.

The Executive Branch, including the United States Army, under the authority of the President of the United States as Commander-in-Chief, did not comply with Taney&#x27;s &quot;Merryman&quot; opinion.

==Background==
When a person is detained by police or other authority, a court can issue a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, compelling the detaining authority either to show proper cause for detaining the person (e.g., by filing criminal charges) or to release the detainee. The court can remand the prisoner to custody, release him on bail, or release him outright. Article I, Section 9 of the United States Constitution, which mostly consists of limitations upon the power of Congress, includes the Suspension Clause:

The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.

In April 1861, when combat erupted in the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln called for the states to provide militia troops to the Federal government to suppress the rebellion. Troops traveling to Washington passed through Baltimore, Maryland. Baltimore mobs objecting to a war with the seceding states attacked some of the troop transports on April 19. It seemed possible that Maryland would attempt to block the passage of troops, cutting off Washington, and impeding a war against the South.

On April 29, the Maryland legislature voted 53–13 against secession, but it also voted not to reopen rail links with the North. It requested that Lincoln remove the growing numbers of federal troops from Maryland. At this time the legislature appeared to want to avoid involvement in a war with its southern neighbors. Fearful that the transport of more Union troops through the city and state would provoke more rioting, and possibly in an attempt to enact secession by extralegal means, Mayor George Brown of Baltimore and Governor Thomas Hicks of Maryland asked that no more troops cross Maryland, but Lincoln refused. For the next few weeks, troops were transported to Washington via Annapolis, avoiding Baltimore. Also on April 19, Lincoln asked Attorney General Edward Bates for an opinion on the suspension of the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;.

The threat to the capital was serious, and Lincoln eventually responded by delegating limited authority to the Army to suspend habeas corpus in Maryland. On April 27, 1861, he told General Winfield Scott (commanding general of the Army) that if there was any resistance on the &quot;military line&quot; from Annapolis to Washington, Scott or &quot;the officer in command at the point&quot; was authorized to suspend &quot;habeas corpus&quot; if necessary.
Following the Maryland legislature&#x27;s April 29 directive that Maryland not be used as a passage for troops attacking the South, Governor Hicks allegedly ordered the state militia to demolish several state railroad bridges (at Bush River and Gunpowder River). Militia Lieutenant John Merryman was arrested on May 25 by order of Brigadier General William High Keim of the United States Volunteers, for his role in destroying the bridges. Merryman was charged with treason and being a commissioned lieutenant in an organization intending armed hostility toward the government.

In another Maryland habeas corpus case, just prior to &quot;Merryman&quot;, Judge William Fell Giles of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland issued a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. The commander of Fort McHenry, Major William W. Morris, wrote in reply,

At the date of issuing your writ, and for two weeks previous, the city in which you live, and where your court has been held, was entirely under the control of revolutionary authorities. Within that period United States soldiers, while committing no offense, had been perfidiously attacked and inhumanly murdered in your streets; no punishment had been awarded, and I believe, no arrests had been made for these atrocious crimes; supplies of provisions intended for this garrison had been stopped; the intention to capture this fort had been boldly proclaimed; your most public thoroughfares were daily patrolled by large numbers of troops, armed and clothed, at least in part, with articles stolen from the United States; and the Federal flag, while waving over the Federal offices, was cut down by some person wearing the uniform of a Maryland officer. To add to the foregoing, an assemblage elected in defiance of law, but claiming to be the legislative body of your State, and so recognized by the Executive of Maryland, was debating the Federal compact. If all this be not rebellion, I know not what to call it. I certainly regard it as sufficient legal cause for suspending the privilege of the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;.

Morris also wrote, &quot;If, in an experience of thirty-three years, you have never before known the writ to be disobeyed, it is only because such a contingency in political affairs as the present has never before arisen.&quot;

Rather than approaching Judge Giles, whose prior order in a Maryland habeas matter had been ignored, Merryman&#x27;s lawyers went to Washington, D.C., and asked Chief Justice Taney to issue a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. Taney promptly issued the writ on Merryman&#x27;s behalf on May 26, 1861; Taney ordered General George Cadwalader, the commander of the military district including Fort McHenry, where Merryman was being held, to bring Merryman before Taney the next day. Taney&#x27;s order directed Cadwalader only to produce Merryman at court, not to release him. During that era, Supreme Court Justices sat as circuit court judges, as well. It is unclear if Taney was acting in his role as a circuit judge for the United States Circuit Court for the District of Maryland, or making use of special authority to hear &quot;habeas&quot; matters permitted to all federal judges, including the Chief Justice, under Section 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789.

Taney stated that he held court on this matter in Maryland, rather than Washington, D.C., in order to permit Gen. Cadwalader to answer the writ in Baltimore rather than the capital, and so not have to leave the limits of his military command.

Cadwalader, although a lawyer, had less than one day to draft a response and defense for his conduct and that of the Army. Cadwalader responded to Taney&#x27;s order on May 27 by sending a colonel to explain that the Army had suspended the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; under presidential authority. Cadwalader also provided a letter explaining the circumstances of Merryman&#x27;s arrest, including that Merryman was arrested by Keim&#x27;s subordinates for treason, and for being illegally in possession of U.S. arms, and for advocating &quot;armed hostility against the Government&quot;. The letter declared that the public safety was still threatened and that any errors &quot;should be on the side of safety to the country&quot;. Because of the serious nature of the charges and complexity of the issues, Cadwalader requested an extension to reply in order to get further instructions from the President.

Taney refused the request, and instead held Cadwalader in contempt of court for refusing to produce John Merryman. Accordingly, Taney issued a writ of attachment for Cadwalader, ordering a U.S. Marshal to seize Cadwalader and bring him before the court the following day.

Cadwalader had been sent instructions on May 28, 1861, from Army headquarters explicitly acknowledging issuance by Chief Justice Taney of the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, and ordering Cadwalader, under the President&#x27;s authority, to keep holding Merryman in custody. On that same day, the Executive Branch – namely, a U.S. Marshal – attempted to execute Taney&#x27;s writ of attachment, but the U.S. Marshal was refused entry into the fort. There is no concrete documentation that Cadwalader had received those instructions prior to the time when the Marshal was refused entrance at Fort McHenry; there is no evidence that Cadwalader ever received those instructions from Army Headquarters. Because the Marshal was unable to serve the attachment, the citation for contempt was never adjudicated. At the end of the &quot;Merryman&quot; litigation, it became a nullity, as do all civil contempt orders at the termination of litigation.

==Decision==
On May 28, Taney stated from the bench that the President can neither suspend &quot;habeas corpus&quot; nor authorize a military officer to do it, and that military officers cannot arrest a person not subject to the rules and articles of war, except as ordered by the courts. Taney noted that, while the marshal had the right to call up the &quot;posse comitatus&quot; to assist him in seizing General Cadwalader and in bringing him before the court, it was probably unwise for the marshal to do so, as the civilian and military authorities might collide and violence ensue, and thus Taney would not punish the marshal for failing in his task. He then promised a more lengthy, written ruling within the week and ordered that it be sent to President Lincoln, &quot;in order that he might perform his constitutional duty, to enforce the laws, by securing obedience to the process of the United States&quot;.

Critics of Taney believe that he was a partisan Democrat and an opponent of Lincoln and that his politics influenced his decision in &quot;Merryman.&quot; This criticism may have support in the fact that the Taney Court should have dismissed the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; case after finding &quot;that the Court had no jurisdiction over Dred Scott&#x27;s case because he was not a citizen&quot; but instead choose to rule that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional despite that issue not being before the Court. In &quot;Merryman&quot;, Taney&#x27;s decision to deny General Cadwalader time to consult the president and dispatch a US Marshal to arrest him during a Civil War and bring him before his court demonstrated partisan corruption on Taney&#x27;s part. On the other hand, partisan Democrat or not, Taney&#x27;s &quot;Merryman&quot; opinion was arguably a simple application of well-established law and consulting the president was irrelevant for General Cadwalader because Lincoln didn&#x27;t have jurisdiction. Lincoln was also critical of Taney because of his ruling in the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; case. The case became historic because not only did President Lincoln refuse to comply with Taney&#x27;s ruling, which does have precedent, but he directly violated it by continuing the suspension without congressional approval. It has never been squarely determined whether the president has any independent authority to suspend &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, or whether Lincoln&#x27;s intentionally violating Taney&#x27;s ruling without legal consequence stands as a precedent.

Taney filed his written opinion on June 1, 1861, with the United States Circuit Court for the District of Maryland. In it, he argued at length against Lincoln for granting himself easily abused powers. Taney&#x27;s opinion was based in large part on the fact that the Suspension Clause is located in Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution, and &quot;This article is devoted to the Legislative Department of the United States, and has not the slightest reference to the Executive Department&quot;. Taney also asserted that the President was not authorized to suspend &quot;habeas corpus&quot; because only Parliament, not the King, had such powers under English law. Referring to other provisions in the Bill of Rights, Taney wrote:

Taney noted in a footnote to the above passage that the United States Declaration of Independence listed making the military power independent of and superior to the civil power as one justification for dissolving political allegiance. The Declaration of Independence states, &quot;He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.&quot; Taney&#x27;s opinion quoted an earlier opinion by Chief Justice John Marshall in the case of &quot;Ex parte Bollman&quot;:

Taney&#x27;s final order in &quot;Merryman&quot; never actually ordered Cadwalader (the actual defendant), the Army, Lincoln or his administration, or anyone else to release John Merryman.

==Lincoln&#x27;s rationale==
The most common view is that the Lincoln administration did not comply with the rule of law by defying Chief Justice Taney&#x27;s &quot;Merryman&quot; opinion and thus Lincoln and his administration invoked nonacquiescence. Alternatively, another view is that Taney was wrong about the law, and so noncompliance was not only reasonable but the only justified response.

Merryman remained in custody while Congress remained in recess. Lincoln also received an opinion supporting his suspension from his Attorney General, Edward Bates. The Bates opinion (or a preliminary draft of that opinion) may have influenced Lincoln&#x27;s subsequent message to Congress that discussed his administration&#x27;s policy in regard to habeas corpus. However, Lincoln&#x27;s message to Congress was dated July 4, 1861; the Bates opinion was dated the next day, July 5, 1861. Lincoln, in his message to Congress, framed the issue as:

Scholars, both during and after the war, largely sided with Lincoln&#x27;s argument over Taney&#x27;s. According to historian Michael Burlingame, &quot;Lincoln had a good argument, for Congress in that era was often out of session, and an invasion or rebellion might well take place during one of its long recesses, just as had occurred in April.&quot;

==Historical context==
In the month preceding the &quot;Merryman&quot; case, Baltimore Mayor Brown, the entire city council, the police commissioner, and the entire Board of Police, were arrested and imprisoned at Fort McHenry without charges, creating some controversy. In September after the &quot;Merryman&quot; ruling, and in disregard of it, the Army arrested sitting Democratic U.S. Congressman for Maryland Henry May, and fully one third of the members of the Maryland General Assembly, and expanded the geographical zone within which the writ of habeas corpus was suspended. When prominent Baltimore newspaper editor Frank Key Howard (Francis Scott Key&#x27;s grandson) in a September editorial criticized Lincoln&#x27;s failure to comply with Chief Justice Taney&#x27;s &quot;Merryman&quot; opinion, Howard was himself arrested by Federal troops under orders from Lincoln&#x27;s Secretary of State Seward and held without charge or trial. Howard described these events in his 1863 book &quot;Fourteen Months in American Bastiles&quot;, where he noted that he was imprisoned in Fort McHenry, the same fort where the Star Spangled Banner had been waving &quot;o&#x27;er the land of the free&quot; in his grandfather&#x27;s song. Two of the publishers selling his book were then arrested. In all, nine newspapers were shut down in Maryland by the federal government, and a dozen newspaper owners and editors like Howard were imprisoned without charges.

In October 1861, one of them, John Murphy, asked the United States Circuit Court for the District of Columbia to issue a writ of habeas corpus for his son, then in the United States Army, on the grounds that he was underage. When the writ was delivered to General Andrew Porter Provost Marshal of the District of Columbia, he had both the lawyer delivering the writ and the United States Circuit Judge William Matthew Merrick, who issued the writ, arrested to prevent them from proceeding in the case &quot;United States ex rel. Murphy v. Porter&quot;. Merrick&#x27;s fellow judges took up the case and ordered General Porter to appear before them, but Lincoln&#x27;s Secretary of State Seward prevented the federal marshal from delivering the court order. The court objected that this disruption of its process was unconstitutional as the president had not declared martial law (while acknowledging that he had the power to do so) but noted that it was powerless to enforce its prerogatives.

In November 1861, Richard Bennett Carmichael, a presiding state circuit court judge in Maryland, was imprisoned without charge for releasing, due to his concern that arrests were arbitrary and civil liberties had been violated, many of the southern sympathizers seized in his jurisdiction. The order came from Secretary of State Seward. The federal troops executing Judge Carmichael&#x27;s arrest beat him unconscious in his courthouse while his court was in session before dragging him out, initiating yet another public controversy.

In early 1862, Lincoln took a step back from the suspension of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; controversy. On February 14, he ordered most political prisoners released, with some exceptions (such as editor Howard), and offered them amnesty for past treason or disloyalty, so long as they did not aid the Confederacy.

==Aftermath==
===Indictment of Merryman===
On July 10, by which time Congress was able to reconvene for a special session, Merryman was indicted for treason by a grand jury in Baltimore for the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The indictment alleged that in cooperation with 500 armed men Merryman had &quot;most wickedly, maliciously, and traitorously&quot; waged war on the United States. He was charged with destroying six railroad bridges and the telegraph lines along the tracks, all with the intent to impede the passage of troops and obstruct vital military communications. Thirteen witnesses to the actions were listed. Seven other men were indicted along with Merryman. On July 13, he was released pending trial upon the posting $20,000 bail.

The case never came to trial. Since treason was a capital offense, it had to be tried in the circuit court. For Maryland-related alleged crimes, this meant that Taney and District Judge William F. Giles would both hear the case, as they were the only two federal judges for the United States Circuit Court for the District of Maryland. Taney consistently refused to schedule hearings for any of those charged, claiming that he believed they would not receive a fair trial in Maryland during wartime conditions. He also discouraged Judge Giles from hearing the case by himself and resisted efforts to have another Justice replace him (part of his delay was blamed on poor health). As the refusal continued into 1864, Taney wrote to Justice Samuel Nelson that &quot;I will not place the judicial power in this humiliating position nor consent to degrade and disgrace it, and if the district attorney presses the prosecutions I shall refuse to take them up.&quot; Salmon P. Chase, nominated by President Lincoln and succeeding Taney as Chief Justice and circuit judge for Maryland, also delayed hearing &quot;Merryman&quot; and other similar Maryland treason cases.

===Congressional response===
After reconvening in July, Congress failed to pass a bill favored by Lincoln to explicitly approve his &quot;habeas corpus&quot; suspensions and to authorize the administration to continue them. The administration would continue the arrests, regardless, with a new wave of arrests beginning in Maryland in September 1861. However, in the summer of 1861, Congress did adopt more general retroactive language rendering Lincoln&#x27;s previous actions during the spring &quot;in all respects legalized&quot;.

In March 1862 U.S. Congressman Henry May (D-Maryland), who had been imprisoned in the new wave of arrests and held without charges from September 1861 to December 1861, introduced a bill requiring the federal government either to indict by grand jury or release all other &quot;political prisoners&quot; still held without &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. May&#x27;s bill passed the House in summer 1862, and its position would later be included in the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act 1863, which would require actual indictments for suspected traitors.

Several months later, faced with opposition to his calling up of the militia, Lincoln again suspended &quot;habeas corpus&quot; in the entire country and made anyone charged with interfering with the draft, discouraging enlistments, or aiding the Confederacy subject to martial law. In the interim, the controversy continued with several calls made for prosecution of those who acted under Lincoln&#x27;s suspension of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. Former Secretary of War Simon Cameron had even been arrested in connection with a suit for trespass &quot;vi et armis&quot;, assault and battery, and false imprisonment.

In February 1863, former Maryland Governor Hicks who had requested that Lincoln not transport troops through the state was now a U.S. Senator, and claimed: &quot;I believe that arrests and arrests alone saved the State of Maryland not only from greater degradation than she suffered, but from everlasting destruction. ... I approved them [the arrests] then, and I approve them now; and the only thing for which I condemn the Administration in regard to that matter is that they let some of these men out.&quot;

The passage of the &quot;Habeas Corpus&quot; Suspension Act in March 1863 finally ended the controversy, at least temporarily, by authorizing presidential suspension of the writ during the Civil War, but requiring indictment by grand jury (or release) of political prisoners, and by indemnifying federal officials who had arrested citizens without &quot;habeas&quot; in the previous two years. It has been argued that after this Act was passed, Lincoln and his administration continued to arrest and hold prisoners without giving such prisoners the procedural protections mandated by the Act. In doing so, Lincoln and his administration relied wholly on presidential power claims.

===Later discussion by courts===
The rest of the U.S. Supreme Court had nothing to do with &quot;Merryman&quot;, and the other two justices from the South, John Catron and James Moore Wayne, acted as Unionists. For instance, Catron&#x27;s charge to a Saint Louis grand jury, saying that armed resistance to the federal government was treason, was quoted in the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; of July 14, 1861. On circuit, Catron closely cooperated with military authorities.

Several district and circuit court rulings followed Taney&#x27;s opinion. However, according to historian Harold Hyman, most northern lawyers accepted Lincoln&#x27;s view that Taney&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Merryman&quot; was &quot;ultimately reversible by political processes&quot;, and Taney&#x27;s opinion in that case &quot;convinced no other justices and few lower federal judges&quot;. However, Taney&#x27;s &quot;Merryman&quot; opinion was adopted by some lower courts, such as the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and the Supreme Court of Wisconsin. See, e.g., Ex parte McQuillon, 16 F. Cas. 347, 348 (S.D.N.Y. 1861) (No. 8294) (Betts, J.) (&quot;[Judge Betts] would, however, follow out that case [&quot;Merryman&quot;], but would express no opinion whatever, as it would be indecorous on his part to oppose the [C]hief [J]ustice. He would therefore decline taking any action on the writ at all.&quot;); In re Kemp, 16 Wis. 359, 1863 WL 1066, at *8 (1863) (Dixon, C.J.) (&quot;I deem it advisable, adhering to the precedent set by other courts and judges under like circumstances, and out of respect to the national authorities, to withhold [granting habeas relief] until they shall have had time to consider what steps they should properly take in the case&quot;). Just as Taney chose not to grant John Merryman relief at the termination of litigation, Betts and Dixon also refused to grant the litigants before them, who were situated similar to Merryman, released from imprisonment.

The &quot;Merryman&quot; decision is still among the best-known Civil War-era court cases and one of Taney&#x27;s most famous opinions, alongside the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; case. Its legal argument holding that Congress alone may suspend the writ was restated by Justice Antonin Scalia in a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice John Paul Stevens, in the case of &quot;Hamdi v. Rumsfeld&quot;. In that case, Scalia and Stevens also described a time-limited exception to the &quot;habeas corpus&quot; right:

Where the commitment was for felony or high treason, the did not require immediate release, but instead required the Crown to commence criminal proceedings within a specified time…. [T]he practical effect of this provision was that imprisonment without indictment or trial for felony or high treason under §7 would not exceed approximately three to six months. The &quot;Hamdi&quot; case, though, did not involve any suspension of the writ, much less a suspension by the President while Congress was unavailable, and no U.S. Supreme Court decision has ever squarely endorsed or rejected Taney&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Merryman&quot;.

===Scholarly reactions during the Civil War===
An 1862 essay by Horace Binney criticized Taney&#x27;s treatment of the earlier &quot;Bollman&quot; opinion by Chief Justice Marshall. According to Binney, &quot;there was nothing before Chief Justice [Marshall] to raise the distinction between Congress and the President&quot; and in any event those lines by Chief Justice Marshall were &quot;altogether&quot; obiter dicta.

Sidney George Fisher wrote the only full-length book on the Constitution in the Civil War that was published during the war itself. Regarding &quot;Merryman&quot;, Fisher&#x27;s treatise looked to practice in the mother country:
The Habeas Corpus Act can only be suspended by Parliament; but in the absence of Parliament, or even when Parliament is in session, and the case demanded instant and secret action, the Ministers of the Crown, when the public safety has, in their opinion, required it, have habitually taken the responsibility of suspending the benefits or privilege of the writ. When Parliament meet, they immediately ask for a bill of indemnity, and also for a suspension of the act itself, should the danger continue. The consent of Parliament is therefore required for any invasion of personal liberty, either before or after such invasion, has always been asked since the statute of 31 Charles II, and has always been granted.

Even before Fisher&#x27;s book came out in 1862, scholars were disputing Taney&#x27;s assertion that Article I of the Constitution &quot;has not the slightest reference to the Executive Department&quot;. For example, an October 1861 article in the &quot;University of Pennsylvania Law Review&quot; (then called &quot;The American Law Register&quot;) pointed out that Article I, Section 9 (where the Suspension Clause is located) includes the Appropriations Clause which pertains to the executive branch.

Sidney George Fisher had a son Sydney George Fisher who compiled a list of 43 pamphlets or the like on the &quot;habeas corpus&quot; question that had been published during the Civil War.
