<text>Minocqua () is a town in northwestern Oneida County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 4,414 as of 2018. The census-designated place of Minocqua and the unincorporated community of Rantz are both located in the town. Minocqua is commonly referred to as &quot;The Island City.&quot;

==History==
Minocqua was officially organized in the year 1889. Although there are varying explanations regarding the meaning of the word &quot;Minocqua&quot;, most credit its origin to the Island&#x27;s first inhabitants, the Ojibwe. The town Minocqua is named after, &quot;Ninocqua&quot;, the Ojibwe name that is defined as &quot;noon-day-rest&quot;.

In the late 1800s, Minocqua was a logging town. Minocqua Clawson was the first child born in the town. Clawson Hill was a famous landmark in town, and it is now the current location of the Pointe Resort &amp; Hotel at the south end of the Highway 51 bridge.

The construction of railroads was a critical component of Minocqua&#x27;s early growth. The Milwaukee Road originally came to the area to provide access to timber. Later, railroads catered to sportsmen and tourists, transforming Minocqua into the vacation getaway it remains to this day. The two railroad trestles that brought trains to the Island are still intact and serve as the trailhead for the Bearskin State Trail that provides hiking and biking in summer, and snowmobiling in winter.

Much of the town&#x27;s business district was destroyed by a major fire in 1912. Many of the buildings on the main street today were designed and built after the fire. Although the last several decades have brought a higher percentage of visitor-oriented retail stores, the downtown still retains a U.S. post office, banks, restaurants, and a barbershop. The Island, Minocqua&#x27;s city center, contains the Campanile Center for the Arts, the Minocqua Police Department, Minocqua Fire Department, and the Minocqua Community Center, which houses the town offices and public library.

Landmarks on the Island include Torpy Park, the Belle-Isle building and the Minocqua Community Center. Town offices and the Minocqua Public Library are located in the Minocqua Community Center. Bosacki&#x27;s Boat House burned to the ground in 1972. Although state regulations prohibited the structure being rebuilt over water, a public outcry convinced the DNR to allow it to be rebuilt where it had originally stood.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 168.1 square miles (435.4 km), of which, 150.8 square miles (390.6 km) of it is land and 17.3 square miles (44.8 km) of it is water. The total area is 10.29% water.

Termed the &quot;Island City,&quot; a portion of the town is situated on what was an actual island, which is accessible by bridge on Highway 51 and &quot;the fill&quot; to the north. Much of Minocqua has sandy soil, although areas of the far northwest and the northeast are clay. The majority of the soil is highly acidic and many areas are covered by forests.

The highest point in Minocqua is Squirrel Hill, located near Winter Park (1735 ft). The highest structure in Minocqua is the Lakeland Sanitary District water tower, a steel tank on Hwy 51 North put in place in the 1960s during the winter.

The community of Bo-di-Lac (short for &quot;Booth-Diamond-Lac du Flambeau) is located in the western portion of the town bordered by Squirrel Lake, Diamond Lake, Booth Lake, and the town of Lac du Flambeau.

==Tourism==
Tourism plays a substantial role in the economy of Minocqua. As a forested lake community, there are many outdoor summer activities, such as fishing, camping, waterskiing, boating, hiking, bike riding, berry collecting, and swimming.

A business strip runs through the downtown (&quot;The Island&quot;), with tourist attractions and shopping. Minocqua&#x27;s nightlife includes bars hosting live music in the summer. A Fourth of July parade is presented annually. Events include dancing, live music, fireworks, and a Min-Aqua Bat waterski and boat show.

During the fall, rifle and bow hunting draw many visitors, as does the annual downtown merchants&#x27; Beef-a-Rama held the last Saturday in September. Winter activities include snowmobile festivals, Nordic (cross country) skiing, ice fishing, downhill skiing in nearby hills, snow tubing, sleigh rides, and snowmobiling. Minocqua is home to Minocqua Winter Park, a cross-country skiing venue, as well as a sledding hill and ice-skating pond.

Minocqua is home to one of the world&#x27;s oldest amateur water ski teams, the Min-Aqua Bats. The Min-Aqua bats have been performing at the Aqua Bowl for over 70 summers as a nonprofit organization, with regular shows starting in 1952.

Arts activities include the Campanile Center for the Arts which operates year-round, offering an array of high quality artists to captivate, intrigue and inspire audiences. The Campanile also provides music, theater, and visual art instruction.

===Museums===
The Minocqua Museum is located in Minocqua. Its exhibits portray Minocqua’s early days.

The U.S. flag that was lowered by the last U.S. soldiers to depart from the Vietnam War is on exhibit at the American Legion Post in Minocqua.

<text>Rhinelander is a city in and the county seat of Oneida County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 8,285 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The area that eventually became the city of Rhinelander was originally called Pelican Rapids by early settlers, named for the stretch of rapids just above the convergence of the Wisconsin and Pelican Rivers. Around 1870, Anderson W. Brown of Stevens Point and Anson P. Vaughn traveled up the Wisconsin River to cruise timber for Brown&#x27;s father, E. D. Brown. Upon arriving at the meeting point of the Wisconsin and Pelican Rivers at the site of John Curran&#x27;s trading post, and seeing the high banks along the rapids and the excellent pine stands, Anderson Brown envisioned a mill town with a lumber mill powered by the waters of the Wisconsin River. Brown&#x27;s vision did not come to fruition for some years, but after subsequent expeditions with others, including his brother and Rhinelander&#x27;s first mayor, Webster Brown, the brothers managed to convince their father and uncle to purchase the land from the federal government and build a town.

In its charter, the city was named Rhinelander after Frederic W. Rhinelander of New York, who was president of the Milwaukee, Lake Shore and Western Railway at the time. This was part of a bid by the Brown brothers to induce the railroad to extend a spur to the location to further their lumbering business. Ultimately, after over ten years of negotiations, the Brown family agreed to convey half their land holdings in the area to the railroad in exchange for a rail line to their future city. In 1882, the railroad line from present-day Monico to Rhinelander was completed, jump-starting the development of Rhinelander as the commercial hub of the region.

<text>Three Lakes is a town in Oneida County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 2,131 at the 2010 census. The census-designated place of Three Lakes is located in the town. The unincorporated community of Clearwater Lake is also located in the town.

==History==

Three Lakes, Wisconsin was named for the three lakes the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad Company had to route around while attempting to plan a railroad through the Three Lakes region: Maple, Townline, and Range Line lakes. It formally became a town in 1881.

The early industry in the town was logging and forestry. Three Lakes and the rest of the Northwoods supplied wood to build Chicago after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. During that time, most of the area&#x27;s virgin forests were cleared and it was only in the 1930s that a process began to replant them. As a result of these replanting efforts, logging and forestry continue to be an important industry in Three Lakes.

As the logging industry moved out of the area, many of the cleared areas were converted to potato farms and agriculture became the community&#x27;s primary industry through the early 1900s. However, over time these family potato farms were replaced by larger corporate commercial enterprises, which are no longer in production.

Three Lakes began growing as a tourist and summer vacation destination in the late 1930s. The increasing availability of automobiles, combined with the roads that existed from the logging industry, made the lakes and forests of the Three Lakes area an attractive vacation destination. Tourism was the primary industry in Three Lakes beginning in the 1970s and continues to be today.

The town also has light manufacturing, a winery, an arts center and numerous retail businesses that have diversified its economy. The town has made substantial investments in developing high speed Internet and broadband capabilities.

<text>Bear Creek is a village in Outagamie County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 448 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The community began as a lumber camp in 1850 when Captain Welcome Hyde, a lumberman, located on the bank of the Embarrass River and cut the first road into the area. The Milwaukee, Lake Shore, and Western Railroad (later Chicago and North Western Railway) was constructed through the area on its way to Clintonville, and began passenger and freight service through Bear Creek in 1878. Hyde built a store in what became Bear Creek Station. In 1885, land was platted for Hyde alongside the railroad right-of-way, and named Bear Creek after the nearby stream. In June 1898, the community and its post office were renamed Welcome, after Capt. Hyde.

In June 1902, work began to incorporate the community into a village. A disastrous fire struck the town on July 11, 1902, in which most of its business district was destroyed, owing in part to the fact that the community did not have a fire service of any kind. The day after this fire, an election was held on the question of incorporation, which passed, 65–15, and thus the Village of Welcome was established.

In the meantime, the cause of the fire was investigated and believed to be arson. In early 1903, Lucille Colbert was charged with setting fire to her own millinery and causing $80,000 in damage to the village. An unsigned letter, believed to be written in Colbert&#x27;s handwriting, was mailed to the village&#x27;s Catholic church, in which a man on his deathbed claimed responsibility for the fire, as retribution for a dispute with Colbert. A publicly followed multi-year trial and appeal process was set in motion. Colbert was convicted in on December 5, 1903, the day after &quot;the largest crowd ever gathered in the Appleton courtroom&quot; (300) heard closing arguments. Her conviction was appealed as she first remained under guard in a hotel. It was ultimately overturned in 1905 by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, headed by John B. Winslow, and a new trial was ordered. In 1907, a new trial having been on the court&#x27;s calendar for each year thereafter, the case was officially dropped, with Colbert never having served a day behind bars.

The name of the village of Welcome was changed back to Bear Creek by consent of the Wisconsin Legislature on July 2, 1915, because of the confusion resulting from the village and the railroad station having different names.

The Chicago and North Western Railway abandoned their railway between New London and Clintonville in 1982. This was the track completed in 1878 which was largely responsible for Bear Creek&#x27;s establishment. Once rails and ties were removed, the line right of way through Bear Creek was not repurposed.

<text>The Town of Center is a located in Outagamie County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 3,622 as of the 2020 census. The unincorporated communities of Center Valley, Hamples Corner, Mackville, and Twelve Corners are located in the town. The unincorporated community of Five Corners is also located partially in the town.

== History ==
The Town of Center began as the Town of Lansing, organized on September 12, 1849. It included the modern day areas of the towns of Freedom and Center, and &quot;territory lying to the north that was sparsely settled&quot;. The town of Freedom was established as a new town split off from the town of Lansing on June 5, 1852. When the split occurred, Freedom took with it the officers of the town of Lansing, as well as the town seat, and many of its residents and public improvements.

A meeting was held on July 5, 1852, to fill the vacancies for the officers of the existing town of Lansing, although in practice this was the reorganization of a new town also called Lansing since there were no officers to provide continuity. The legality of the action was apparently questioned. An April 30, 1853, resolution of the board of supervisors of the town declared that the state of Wisconsin had granted legality to &quot;acts of the town officers of last year&quot;, and also had granted the request of the board to have the name of the town changed from Lansing to Center, effective April 1, 1853.

<text>Cicero is a town in Outagamie County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,092 at the 2000 census.

== History ==
Cicero was originally separated from the Town of Black Creek (then Black Creek&#x27;s northern half). Petitioners requested the new town in January 1871. The Outagamie county board determined that it was illegal to divide the town of Black Creek at the time, because bonds issued to build the Green Bay and Lake Pepin railroad through the Town of Black Creek were still outstanding. Therefore, a special session of the Wisconsin state legislature performed the action, assigning $5,000 of the bond debt to the new town of Cicero, and $7,000 to the town of Black Creek. The meeting to elect officers of the town was held April 4, 1871.

Cicero was named for Cicero, New York, the former home of the chairman of the new town.

<text>Freedom is a town in Outagamie County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 6,200 at the 2020 census. The unincorporated communities of Freedom and Murphy Corner are located in the town and the unincorporated community of Five Corners is located partially within the town.

==History==
The first non-native settler in the Town of Freedom was James Andrew Jackson, an African-American who arrived in 1830. Jackson was asked by town residents if they could name the town &quot;Jackson&quot; after him, but he wanted the town to be named Freedom because this was where he obtained his freedom.

The Town of Freedom was established on June 5, 1852, and was split off from the Town of Lansing. In doing so, Freedom took most of the town of Lansing&#x27;s residents, its town seat, and all of its standing town officers. (The remaining town and land comprising Lansing was renamed the Town of Center in April 1853).

<text>Grand Chute (French: &quot;great fall&quot; or &quot;large rapids&quot;) is a town in Outagamie County, Wisconsin, United States. It is a part of the Appleton, Wisconsin Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 23,831 at the 2020 census. The unincorporated community of Apple Creek is partially located in the town. It was the birthplace of U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy.

== History ==
The Town of Grand Chute was formed on April 3, 1849 inside what was then Brown County, Wisconsin. By state legislative act, Grand Chute was split off of the Town of Kaukaulan (later Kaukauna). The Town of Grand Chute&#x27;s boundary at its establishment comprised a much larger area than it has today, formed by what today are the towns of Dale, Hortonia, Greenville, Ellington, and present-day Grand Chute. By 1850, due to a large influx of new settlers, the towns of Hortonia (which included Dale at the time), Greenville, and Ellington had all been split away from Grand Chute to form new towns.

Outagamie County was set up by law in February 1851 and had its county government formally organized on April 1, 1851. At that time, the Town of Grand Chute (which by definition changed from Brown to Outagamie County) was established as the seat of county government affairs.

Grand Chute&#x27;s population in 1984 was estimated to be 10,874. In March of that year, residents overwhelmingly approved using town funds to attempt incorporation into a village. After town hearings in late 1984, Grand Chute petitioned to the State of Wisconsin. The Wisconsin Department of Development denied the town&#x27;s request to incorporate on March 25, 1985. At the time of the denial, the DOD&#x27;s findings were that some (but not necessarily all) government services would be better provided by the City of Appleton, and that the proposed village was not compact or homogenous.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 25.0 square miles (64.6 km2), of which 24.9 square miles (64.5 km2) is land and 0.1 square mile (0.2 km2) (0.32%) is water.

Grand Chute is the largest town in Wisconsin, both in terms of population (20,919 at the 2010 census) and valuation (over $2.4 billion). It is part of the Fox Cities metroplex that includes Oshkosh, Neenah, Menasha, and Appleton.

==Economy==
Grand Chute is the most concentrated retail center in Wisconsin.

On July 30, 2008, NewPage announced its plans to close the plant in August 2008, and sever employment by September 30, 2008.

The Kimberly Mill continued to produce fine paper, magazine paper and specialty paper, until the shut down date. In 2011 NewPage sold the property to AIM (American Iron &amp; Metal) Demolition USA. After efforts to reopen the mill were unsuccessful, equipment was auctioned off, and the demolition of the mill commenced.

<text>Little Chute is a village in Outagamie County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 10,449 at the 2010 census. It is immediately east of the city of Appleton, Wisconsin and runs along the Fox River. It is a part of the Appleton, Wisconsin Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The town was originally established as a trading post by French explorers who called it &quot;Le Petite Chute&quot; (Little Chute). In the late 19th century, it was settled by Dutch Catholic immigrants from North Brabant, led initially by the Dominican Missionary Theodore J. van den Broek from Uden. The town became an outpost of Dutch Catholic immigrants in the Midwest. Little Chute is home to a full-scale Dutch-style working windmill, which has become a tourist attraction.

Prior to European exploration it is likely the Mississippian culture tribe, the Oneota lived in the area. The Oneota are believed to be the ancestors of the Winnebago or Ho-Chunk tribe. A historical marker near Little Chute commemorates the Treaty of the Cedars, a treaty which ceded 4 million acres of Native American land to the US government.

==History==

While sharing in the history of northeast Wisconsin, Little Chute has been influenced by two unique factors: the rapids and portages along the Fox River and the coming of Dutch-Catholic settlers in 1848. Prior to and during the early European settlement, the Fox-Wisconsin Waterway to the Mississippi River system was one of the most heavily traveled routes between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River. Afterward canals and locks were built to circumvent these rapids. The actual construction of these features provided employment to settlers, the Dutch among them, although the canal system never proved to be a great success. In 1836, the Treaty of the Cedars was signed near Little Chute by the Menominee Indians, which ceded to The United States &quot;Four million acres between the Fox, Wolf and Menominee Rivers&quot;.

===Native Americans===
There is little evidence today of the earliest Native American communities in the area. Prior to the European exploration it is likely the Mississippian culture tribe, the Oneota, lived in the area. The Oneota are believed to be the ancestors of the Winnebago or Ho-Chunk people; this has yet to be conclusively demonstrated. Regardless, the Ho-Chunk dominated the area just as the French were first appearing in the St Lawrence area far to the east. The Illinois tribe was generally far to the south; the Menominee tribe was just to the north. The Ho-Chunk maintained reasonably good relations with both tribes, although there were several battles with the Illinois. While the French had yet to settle in the area, their presence to the east started a chain reaction of tribal migration. The Huron, Ottawa, Potawatomi, and other eastern tribes all had encounters with the Ho-Chunk. The Sauk and Meskwaki peoples, originally in the St. Lawrence Valley, migrated first to southeastern Michigan. The Meskwaki (Renard in French) called themselves the Meshkwahkihaki and were also known as the Outagamie by the French. The Sac and Meskwaki were uprooted again by eastern tribes and began to arrive in the Fox River Valley in the late 17th century. The Sac and Fox eventually drove most of the Ho-Chunk from the area. When the first French settlers appeared, they named the river after the Fox. The county which today includes Little Chute was to be named Outagamie.

The series of rapids along the Fox River near Little Chute necessitated canoe portages. By the time the French settlement started in the early 18th century, the Sac had essentially set up toll stations along the Fox-Wisconsin Waterway, including the rapids at Little Chute. The French, outraged at the impact on trade, launched a series of attacks on the Sac, culminating in the Fox Wars, which drove them out of the area by 1742.
The power vacuum created by the departure of most of the Ho-Chunk, the Sac and the Fox allowed the Menominee to briefly dominate the area. The Menominee set up a village, Ookicitiming (“causeway” in Menominee) near present-day Little Chute.

===First European settlement===

The first Europeans to the area were the French. Jean Nicolet reached the Fox River at Green Bay in 1634 and set up a trading post. Explorers Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet passed through the area in 1673, following the canoe route to the Mississippi. As early as 1760, the families of Augustin and Charles Grignon, French Canadian Métis, established a fur trade post along the rapids. While French influence waned, it can still be seen in local place names, particularly waterways. Locally the three major rapids on the Fox were named “La Grand Kauklin” (near Grignon&#x27;s trading post at present day Kaukauna), “La Petite Chute” (present day Little Chute) and “La Grand Chute” (still the name of the adjoining township).

The French maintained a presence in the area until the end of the French and Indian War in 1763. The area switched to British control until the end of the Revolutionary War in 1781. The Americans nominally controlled the area although the British continued to maintain a presence until the end of the War of 1812 in 1814. In 1787, the area became part of the American Northwest Territory. In succession the area became part of Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and finally, in 1836, Wisconsin Territories. Statehood was reached in 1848.

===Father Van den Broek and the first Dutch settlers===

The singular person in the establishment of Little Chute as a Catholic Dutch-American community was a Dominican missionary: Father Theodore J. van den Broek. Born to wealthy parents in Amsterdam, Netherlands in June 1784, he had relatives in Uden, North Brabant, Netherlands and apparently spent time there as a youth. He was highly educated and fluent in six languages. He was ordained a priest in 1808 and joined the Dominican Order in 1817. After a period as a pastor in the Netherlands, he left in 1832 at the age of 49 to join other missionary priests at Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1834 he was ordered to Green Bay to an established Dominican mission. In Green Bay he met the Grignon family, and probably through this contact he went to La Petite Chute in 1836. There he built the first church for the Menominee Indians, St. John Nepomucene, one of several he would establish in the area. Father Van den Broek also met Morgan Lewis Martin, who was in charge of the local canal project. Father Van den Broek purchased land in the area which he later hoped to sell. In that same year, 1836, the Menominees signed the “Treaty of the Cedars” which required them to give up title to the local land and move beyond the Wolf River to the west.

Father Van den Broek began to write letters about the area to groups in the Netherlands. The letters appeared in the Roman Catholic paper, &quot;De Tijd&quot; (The Times) beginning in 1843. In the summer of 1847 Father Van den Broek went back to the Netherlands to settle his parents’ estate. The settlement was not very beneficial and he found himself nearly destitute. As St. John Nepomucene parishioners were significantly reduced after the Treaty of the Cedars, he used the trip as an opportunity to again write in &quot;De Tijd&quot;, advertising the mission, the land at La Petite Chute and employment opportunities associated with the Fox River Canal, which included free passage to America for workers. The results were immediate and, by 1848, three wooden sailing vessels called &quot;barks&quot; or &quot;barque&quot; (small three-masted sailing ships), the &quot;Libra&quot;, the &quot;Maria Magdalena&quot; and the &quot;America&quot;, had been booked for passage to the east coast of the United States. Approximate 918 Dutch Catholic immigrants were on the three boats. Most of the early emigrants were from villages near Uden, including Zeeland, Boekel, Mill, Oploo and Gemert. The Dutch economy of the era was stagnant and much of the motivation to emigrate was economic. The emigrants were not poor, as the cost of passage, expenses and land purchase in Wisconsin would have been substantial. They were not, however, affluent and many would have been risking most of their wealth on the chance of economic improvement. There were also political pressures at the time that favored mass emigrations of Catholics.

Typical passage to La Petite Chute included crossing the Atlantic from Rotterdam to New York City, a train trip from there to Albany, a train or Erie Canal-barge trip across New York state to Buffalo, steamship travel through the Great Lakes and Green Bay to the head of the Fox River at Green Bay and finally a 30-mile, ox-cart trip to the mission at La Petite Chute. The first group from Rotterdam arrived on May 22, 1848, led by a Franciscan missionary, Fr Adrianus D. Godthard. Father Van den Broek&#x27;s group, held up by an ice jam on Lake Michigan, arrived on June 10, 1848. The emigrants discovered not plowed fields and a village but forested land, being somewhat misled by wording of the &quot;De Tijd&quot; advertisements: the word “acres” was translated as &quot;akkers&quot;, meaning cultivated land. There was also not enough good land in Father Van den Broek&#x27;s holdings for all the emigrants. There was a resort to drawing straws, with the winners naturally picking the best lots. Many of the others—led by Cornelis van de Heij, a farmer from Zeeland, and Father Godthard—left to form the village of Holland (usually referred to locally as “Hollandtown”) rather than buying the remainder of Father Van den Broek&#x27;s land. There were other Europeans, mainly French and Irish emigrants, already established at La Petite Chute, now also known by its semi-anglicized name of “Little Chute.” A few Native Americans still lived in the area.

===Later Dutch immigration===
Despite the hardships, including the death of Father Van den Broek in 1851, the village prospered. Waves of Catholic Dutch emigrants followed from all over the Netherlands, with whole families and neighborhoods moving to join family and friends already established in Little Chute, Hollandtown, and the outlying farming communities. It is estimated that, by 1927, as many as 40,000 Dutch Roman Catholics had immigrated to the United States—an average rate of 10 per week for 80 years. While many headed for cities or individual farms across the country, Little Chute and the surrounding area represented the largest concentration of Catholic immigrants.

From the start, St. John Nepomucene Church served as a focal point, although other churches would soon spring up in the other communities. The first settlers would have devoted all energies to clearing land, planting, building small homes and barns, fencing and raising livestock. The private Fox River Canal was a failure. The State &quot;Fox and Wisconsin Improvement Company&quot; took over operations in 1850 and finished the canal and adjoining dam by 1856. Railways approached from the south and steamship lines were established on Lakes Michigan and Winnebago. The 16 feet of water head at La Petite Chute and other falls was used for mills, a practice that continues. Little Chute post office was established in 1849. In 1898 the fiftieth anniversary of the founding was commemorated and the surviving &quot;48&#x27;ers&quot; recognized. In 1898, residents of La Petite Chute petitioned the State of Wisconsin for incorporation as the Village of Little Chute, which was formally granted on March 8, 1899.

While there are several other Dutch American cities—Oostburg, Wisconsin; Pella, Iowa; Orange City, Iowa; and Holland, Michigan—these were largely settled by Protestants. Little Chute and some surrounding area was largely settled by Catholics. By the early twentieth century it was the largest Catholic Dutch community in the United States. Little Chute remained a Dutch-speaking community—known locally as &quot;speaking Hollander&quot;—into the twentieth century. As late as 1898, church sermons and event announcements were in Dutch. Dutch newspapers continued in the area—mainly in De Pere by Catholic clergymen—were published up until World War I. Speaking Dutch as a first language was common in the area among second and third generation even as late as World War II. The Dutch festival of Sinterklaas was celebrated as &quot;St Nick’s Day&quot; (December 6). This practice continues in many households today. St. John Nepomucene was the primary educational institution with the local public high school not opening until 1966.

===Present day===

Little Chute celebrated the Dutch festival of Kermis annually from 1981 until 2015. The festival was reinstituted in 1981 after a long hiatus dating back to the early twentieth century, and is possibly the only such named event in the United States. St. John Nepomucene is a thriving parish with recent additions to the church and elementary school.

Little Chute has a full-scale authentic working Dutch windmill operated by Little Chute Windmill, a non-profit organization. The Little Chute Windmill and Van Asten Visitor Center, completed in 2013, serves as a museum and tourist attraction that promotes the history and Dutch heritage of the community.

The Fox River Navigational System Authority is rehabilitating and operating the system of Lower Fox River locks between Lake Winnebago and Green Bay, including the Locks at Little Chute in Doyle Park. Repairs to the Little Chute guard lock, lock and combined locks are scheduled to be completed by 2009. Funding for the bridge at the Little Chute Lock and additional repairs on the Fox River Locks appear to be in question.

While some homes are decorated with windmills and other symbols of Dutch culture, the use of the Dutch language and day-to-day culture has all but discontinued. A tradition from North Brabant, that happens every year in Little Chute is &quot;De Schut&quot; and is a copy of &quot;Koningsschieten&quot; in the province North Brabant in the Netherlands.

The non-profit organization Fox-Wisconsin Heritage Parkway is rehabilitating the Little Chute Lock Tender&#x27;s House with volunteer labor and private donations. It will be restored to its 1930s character and will become a vacation rental. The house is on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="139520" wikidata="Q1019382" url="?curid=139520" title="Mequon, Wisconsin">
<text>Mequon () is the most populous city in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 25,142 at the 2020 census. Located on Lake Michigan&#x27;s western shore with significant commercial developments along Interstate 43, the community is a suburb in the Milwaukee metropolitan area. Despite being the third-largest city in Wisconsin by land area, approximately half of Mequon&#x27;s land is undeveloped, and agriculture plays a significant role in the local economy.

When the first white settlers arrived in the 1830s, the Mequon area was inhabited by the Menominee, Potawatomi, and Sauk people. In the 1840s, German immigrants settled in the community, building farms and hydropowered mills along the Milwaukee River. Much of the community remained rural, while Thiensville developed as a market town along the local railway, providing services to the farmers. Thiensville incorporated as a village in 1910. Mequon remained rural in the early 20th century but experienced significant population growth during the suburbanization that followed World War II. The community incorporated as a city in 1957 to avoid annexation by the City of Milwaukee. The City of Mequon completely surrounds Thiensville, leading some residents to call Thiensville &quot;Mequon&#x27;s donut hole.&quot; The two municipalities have a close relationship, with a shared chamber of commerce, library, and school district.

Lutheranism has played a significant role in Mequon since the community&#x27;s early years. Some of the first German settlers were Old Lutherans who founded the Freistadt community—now a neighborhood in western Mequon—in 1839 and went on to form the first Lutheran congregation in Wisconsin. In the 21st century, there are more Lutheran churches in Mequon than churches of any other single denomination. Additionally, Mequon is home to two private Lutheran post-secondary institutions: Concordia University Wisconsin and Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary. In addition to having other Christian denominations, Mequon is also the northernmost of Milwaukee&#x27;s suburbs to have a sizable Jewish community.

==Toponymy==

&quot;Mequon&quot; may have come from the Ojibwe word &quot;Emikwaan&quot; or &quot;Miguan&quot;, meaning ladle, referring to the shape of the river in the area. Alternatively, the name may come from a Menominee word &quot;Mēkon&quot;, meaning &quot;feather.&quot;

==History==

The area was originally inhabited by Native Americans, including the Menominee, Potawatomi, and Sauk people. In the early 19th century, the Potawatomi had a village in present-day Thiensville located on Pigeon Creek, north of Freistadt Road. In 1832, the Menominee surrendered the land between the Milwaukee River and Lake Michigan to the United States Federal Government through the &quot;Treaty of Washington&quot;. The Potawatomi surrendered the area of Mequon west of the Milwaukee River in 1833 through the &quot;1833 Treaty of Chicago&quot;, which (after being ratified in 1835) required them to leave the area by 1838. While many Native people moved west of the Mississippi River to Kansas, some chose to remain, and were referred to as &quot;strolling Potawatomi&quot; in contemporary documents because many of them were migrants who subsisted by squatting on their ancestral lands, which were now owned by white settlers. Eventually the Potawatomi who evaded forced removal gathered in northern Wisconsin, where they formed the Forest County Potawatomi Community.

European trappers, explorers, and traders used the Milwaukee River through the middle of what is now Mequon as a means of transportation. The first permanent white settlers arrived in the mid-1830s from New York, England, and Ireland. One of the first settlers was John Weston, who settled near present-day Thiensville in 1837 and served as the first postmaster of the Town of Mequon. One of the oldest surviving buildings from this period is the Isham Day House, constructed in 1839 on the west bank of the river. The first Germans arrived in 1839, and in the 1840s Germans became the largest ethnic group in Mequon and Ozaukee County.

===Freistadt===

In October 1839, a party of twenty German families from Pomerania, Prussia, settled the Freistadt community in the western part of the Town of Mequon. They were Old Lutherans who had resisted the Prussian government&#x27;s attempts to take control over the Protestant churches through the Prussian Union of Churches. In German, &quot;Freistadt&quot; means &quot;Free City&quot;.

In 1840, they built a log cabin church, which they named Trinity Lutheran Church. It was the first Lutheran church in Wisconsin. In 1845, what would become the Lutheran Synod of Buffalo was organized in Freistadt. However, the Freistadt church became a part of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod in 1848. The wooden church was replaced with a limestone building in 1884.

===Thiensville===

Joachim Heinrich Thien moved to the area in 1842 from Oldenburg, Prussia, and helped design a plan for the settlement that would become Thiensville. A year later he employed a group of Native American laborers to construct a dam and a canal. He then built a sawmill and a store. Thien hosted the first town meeting for the Town of Mequon in 1846, and in 1857 he established the volunteer fire department and served as its first captain.

Thien was a freethinker, as were many of the early German settlers. The influence of the freethinker societies kept formal churches out of the village until 1919, when St. Cecilia Catholic Church was built.

Thiensville grew in part because of its location on the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway, which was constructed in the early 1870s. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Thiensville was one of the most concentrated communities in the Town of Mequon. While most of Mequon was quite rural, Theinsville functioned as a downtown area with stores, mills, and professional services. The village of Thiensville incorporated in 1910.

In 1945, eighty German prisoners of war from Camp Fredonia in Little Kohler, Wisconsin were contracted to work at the Herbert A. Nieman Canning Company in the village to make up for the loss of labor due to local men fighting in World War II. German prisoners from Camp Rockfield in Rockfield, Wisconsin, (located in present-day Germantown) also worked at the Fromm Bros., Nieman &amp; Co. Fox Ranch in northern Mequon.

In the 20th century, Mequon and the village of Thiensville developed a close relationship, with a shared school district, chamber of commerce, and library.

===City of Mequon===

The Town of Mequon experienced significant population growth during the suburbanization that followed World War II. Between 1950 and 1960, the population increased by roughly 110%, from 4,065 to 8,543. With growth came the risk that municipalities such as Thiensville or Milwaukee would try to annex land from the Town of Mequon, as happened to the Milwaukee County&#x27;s Town of Lake in 1954 and Town of Granville in 1956. With a 1957 population of about 7,500, Mequon incorporated as a city under the terms of Wisconsin statute 66.0215, also known as &quot;The Oak Creek Law,&quot; which had been crafted to prevent suburban towns from being annexed by other municipalities.

According to Tougaloo College&#x27;s &quot;Historical Database of Sundown Towns&quot;, Mequon was probably a sundown town until 1954 when Milwaukee Braves right fielder Hank Aaron moved his family to the community. Aaron could not buy his home directly from its builder and instead had to engage a friend to buy it on his behalf.

The city continued to grow with the construction of Interstate 43 in the mid-1960s, making travel to Milwaukee easier. Despite being a city, much of Mequon remains rural, and nearly half of the land in the community is undeveloped.

==Geography==

Mequon is located at (43.224243, −87.960094), about north of Milwaukee and is part of the Milwaukee metropolitan area. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. As of 2005, Mequon was the third-largest city in terms of land area in the state of Wisconsin. Though much of the population lives in residential areas, approximately half of the land within the city&#x27;s boundaries is undeveloped or farmed.

The Village of Thiensville is an enclave in central Mequon. The city is also bordered by the Town of Cedarburg, City of Cedarburg, and Town of Grafton to the north; Lake Michigan to the east; the Village of Bayside, Village of River Hills, Village of Brown Deer, and City of Milwaukee to the south; and the Village of Germantown to the west.

The city is located on the western shore of Lake Michigan, and the coastline is characterized by clay bluffs ranging from in height with deep ravines where streams flow into the lake. Clay bluffs are a geological formation characteristic of the Lake Michigan shoreline, and are found in few other areas of the world. Much of the coast has mixed gravel and sand beaches.

The city is located in the Southeastern Wisconsin glacial till plains that were created by the Wisconsin glaciation during the most recent ice age. The soil is clayey glacial till with a thin layer of loess on the surface. The city has some limestone deposits, including the Devonian Thiensville formation in north-central Mequon and the Silurian Little Menomonee River Reef District, which contains dolomite marine fossils. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources considers the eastern part of the city along the lake to be in the Central Lake Michigan Coastal ecological landscape, while the western part of the city is in the Southern Lake Michigan Coastal ecological landscape.

The Milwaukee River and its tributary Pigeon Creek flow through the eastern part of the city. Little Menomonee Creek and the Little Menomonee River, which are tributaries of the Menomonee River, flow through western Mequon.

Before white settlers arrived in the area, Mequon was an upland forest dominated by American beech and sugar maple trees. There is also a large tamarack swamp along the Little Menomonee River. Much of the original forest was cleared to prepare the land for agriculture.

==Economy==



Mequon&#x27;s economy was primarily agricultural. Some farmsteads from as early as the 1840s and 1850s still stand in the community and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The first major businesses were hydropowered mills on the Milwaukee River and other businesses that served local farmers, many of which concentrated in Thiensville.

Beginning in the 1920s, the Nieman and Fromm families began fur farming silver foxes in Mequon. Several companies, including Fromm Bros., Nieman &amp; Co.; Federal Silver Fox Farms, Inc.; Ozaukee Fur Farms Co.; Herbert A. Nieman &amp; Co.; and Cedarburg Fox Farms, Inc. all began operating in Mequon and southern Cedarburg in the 1920s. In 1928, 6,600 of the 8,841 pelts sold by the New York Auction Co. came from the Fromm and Nieman operations in Wisconsin for a record-breaking sum of $1,021,000. In 1929, the Nieman and Fromm operations broke their own record with auction sales of $1,331,679, making them a leader in the national fur industry. By 1937, the farms were selling 30,000 pelts per year. After World War II, changing consumer tastes caused the farms to begin breeding mink in addition to silver fox. Fur sales declined later in the 20th century, and the Mequon farms sold their last pelts in 1985.

The mid-to-late 20th century saw diversification in Mequon&#x27;s economy. Retail stores opened to serve the increasingly suburban community, and manufacturers opened plants. In 1983, Concordia University Wisconsin moved from its campus in Milwaukee to a newly acquired campus in Mequon. In 1994, St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital Ozaukee opened. As of 2015, the two institutions—both located in close proximity to Interstate 43—were among the largest employers in Ozaukee County. Despite the growth of new industries, half of Mequon&#x27;s land remains undeveloped and agriculture continues to play a significant role in the local economy.

<text>Thiensville is a village in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. Located on the west bank of a bend in the Milwaukee River, the community is bordered on all sides by the City of Mequon and is a suburb in the Milwaukee metropolitan area. The population was 3,290 at the 2020 census.

Thiensville was the site of a Potawatomi village in the early 19th century before white settlers began arriving in the 1830s and 1840s. Many of the community&#x27;s earliest settlers were German immigrants who were members of freethinker societies. One prominent freethinker was Joachim Heinrich Thien, for whom the village is named. Thien played a significant role in the Town of Mequon&#x27;s early politics and organized the Thiensville Volunteer Fire Department. The freethinkers were opposed to organized religion and actively prevented churches from being established in the community for the first eight decades of its history. Thiensville grew and prospered in the late 1800s when it became a railway stop; the community became more urban with stores, mills and services for farmers in the rural Town of Mequon. The Village of Thiensville formally incorporated in 1910.

Both Mequon and Thiensville experienced significant development during the suburbanization that followed World War II, with Mequon incorporating as a city in 1957. The two communities have close ties, with a shared chamber of commerce, library, fire and emergency medical services, and school district.

==History==
In the early 19th century, the Potawatomi lived on the west bank of the Milwaukee River and had a village in present-day Thiensville, located on Pigeon Creek, north of Freistadt Road. They surrendered their land to the United States federal government through the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which was ratified in 1835 and required them to leave the area by 1838.

The first permanent white settlers arrived in the mid-1830s from New York, England, and Ireland. One of the first settlers was John Weston, who settled near present-day Thiensville in 1837 and served as the first postmaster of the Town of Mequon. The first Germans arrived in 1839, and in the 1840s Germans became the largest ethnic group in Thiensville, the Town of Mequon, and Ozaukee County.

Joachim Heinrich Thien moved to the area in 1842 from Oldenburg, Prussia, and helped design a plan for the settlement that would become Thiensville. A year later he employed a group of Native American laborers to construct a dam and a canal on the Milwaukee River. He then built a sawmill and a store. Thien hosted the first town meeting for the Town of Mequon in 1846, and in 1857 he established the volunteer fire department and served as its first captain.

Thien was a freethinker, as were many of the early German settlers. The influence of the freethinker societies kept formal churches out of the village until 1919, when St. Cecilia Catholic Church was built.

Thiensville grew in part because of its location on the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway, which was constructed in the early 1870s. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Thiensville was one of the most concentrated communities in the Town of Mequon. While most of Mequon was quite rural, Theinsville functioned as a downtown area with stores, mills, and professional services. The Village of Theinsville incorporated in 1910 with a population of 289.

In 1945, eighty German prisoners of war from Camp Fredonia in Little Kohler, Wisconsin were contracted to work at the Herbert A. Nieman Canning Company in the village to make up for the loss of labor due to local men fighting in World War II. German prisoners from Camp Rockfield in Rockfield, Wisconsin, (located in present-day Germantown) also worked at the Fromm Bros., Nieman &amp; Co. Fox Ranch in northern Mequon.

In the 20th century, Mequon and the village of Theinsville developed a close relationship, with a shared school district, chamber of commerce, and library. The communities merged their fire and emergency medical response services to form the Southern Ozaukee Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department on January 1, 2023.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which, of it is land and is water.

The Village of Thiensville is an enclave, surrounded by the City of Mequon on all sides. The village is located on the north and west bank of a bend in the Milwaukee River. Pigeon Creek also flows through downtown Thiensville into the river, with the confluence near the old village hall at the intersection of Main Street and Green Bay Road. There is a dam on the Milwaukee River, upstream from the confluence of the river and the creek.

The village is located in the Southeastern Wisconsin glacial till plains that were created by the Wisconsin glaciation during the most recent ice age. The village is south of the Devonian Thiensville formation, a large limestone deposit lying mostly below the soil with the exception of an exposed rock face at the Cedarburg Road cut in northern Mequon. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources considers the eastern part of Thiensville to be in the Central Lake Michigan Coastal ecological landscape, while the western part of the village is in the Southern Lake Michigan Coastal ecological landscape. Before white settlers arrived in the area, the area was an upland forest dominated by American beech and sugar maple trees. While some areas of Mequon have remained undeveloped, most of Thiensville has been developed and little-to-none of the old growth forest remains.

The region struggles with many invasive species, including the emerald ash borer, common carp, reed canary grass, the common reed, purple loosestrife, garlic mustard, Eurasian buckthorns, and honeysuckles.

<text>Clam Falls is a town in Polk County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 547 at the 2000 census. The unincorporated communities of Clam Falls and Lewis are located in the town.

==History==
Before the Clam River was dammed and logging began, the area around present-day Clam Falls had long been peopled by Native Americans, who called the location Cobbekonta, or &quot;Little Falls&quot;, while the Clam River was known as Kenesca-Seba--&quot;Clam-Shell River&quot;. The St. Croix Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians still inhabit the area, where they are engaged in harvesting wild rice, hunting, fishing, and maple sugaring.

The present Town of Clam Falls is situated on the east bank of Clam Flowage, which is formed by a dam at the confluence of McKenzie Creek and the Clam River. The east and west bank of the river were the location of logging operations since the late 1840s, and the dam was constructed in 1859 by Daniel F. Smith. Smith would go on to improve the Butternut Road, which became known as the Clam Falls Road—a highly travelled roadway extending from Clam Falls to Butternut Lake near present-day Luck, WI. Traces of the road are still visible, and signs continue to mark its former path, which crisscrosses modern-day County Road I.

<text>Amherst Junction is a village in Portage County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 377 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Amherst Junction was created when the railroad first came through the county. It was a junction between two railroads: the Wisconsin Central and the Green Bay and Lake Pepin railroads.

Until 1875, the community was referred to as Groversburg, presumably after the Grover family that held considerable property in the area. But when a post office was established in March 1875, it was called Amherst Junction.

It was not until 1911 that the village was incorporated. By 1914, the village had become an important buying and shipping center for potatoes. Many people traveling to the eastern and northeastern parts of the county would detrain in Amherst Junction and hire a rig from a livery in the village to take them to their destination.

The village at one time had 36 businesses which included: five taverns, two hotels, two grocery stores, dancehalls, depots, feed stores, four potato warehouses, a blacksmith, a livery stable, a meat market, bank, hardware store, car dealership, a post office, a school, and a turkey processing plant.

The Summit House, a fairly large hotel, was built in the village around 1872 or 1873 by H. N. Livermore. Since the hotel was a popular place to stay, eat and dance, Amherst Junction must have been a gathering center for many of the surrounding communities. The Summit House remained in business until 1939, when it was dismantled and its lumber was used to build a new home for the owner. At one time, the hotel was operated by Zilphia Moyers Een, the county&#x27;s first woman hotel keeper.

<text>Junction City is a village in Portage County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 439 at the 2010 census.

==History==
In 1872 the Wisconsin Central Railroad laid rail west from Stevens Point through forests and swamps, heading toward what would become Marshfield, aiming to eventually reach Lake Superior. In 1874 the Wisconsin Valley Railroad built a rail line north from Centralia (Wisconsin Rapids) to Wausau, crossing the Wisconsin Central. At the intersection of the two lines, cars could be switched and a community began to grow. In 1874 a post office was established there, with the name &quot;Junction&quot;.

In 1876 the &quot;Stevens Point Journal&quot; reported sudden growth at Junction City. The previous year the community had only two log shanties, but in 1876 there were &quot;two depots, two saw mills, one hotel, one boarding house, one saloon, three dwelling houses and school house...&quot; One of the sawmills may have operated a company store too. The hotel was called the Junction City Hotel &amp; Billiard Hall.

An 1895 plat map shows two depots near the junction - one for each railroad. The Wisconsin Central&#x27;s depot is also a hotel. Voyer House hotel is nearby, and the post office too. A school and the town hall appeared on what is now Main Street, away from the rail junction. By this time the junction also had several stores. Timber was still being cut in the surrounding lands, leaving behind fields of stumps, to be sold to farmers who survived by logging in winter.

In the 1890s graphite was found in the area. It was mined via an underground mine 70 feet deep, and processed in a crushing mill a mile northwest of Junction City. At times, the plant produced &quot;several tons of the finished paint and paste product per day.&quot; This enterprise survived several fires and a damaging cyclone before closing in 1921.

In 1911 the community incorporated as a village named &quot;Junction City&quot;. That year&#x27;s personal property roll counted eight horses in town, twelve cows, five people raising swine, and nine carriages etc, but no automobiles. In the early 1900s Junction City had four potato warehouses, serving the potato farmers in the surrounding Town of Carson.

A 1915 plat map shows one shared depot at the junction of the rail lines, with a line of businesses lining the west side of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad: saloon, office, post office, blacksmith shop, lunch room, saloon. Other businesses are scattered further out: the Junction City State Bank, two creameries, two &quot;factories,&quot; the school, a store, and several warehouses. (By this time the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul had absorbed the Wisconsin Valley Railroad and the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad operated the Wisconsin Central.)

Fires had damaged and destroyed a number of enterprises over the years. Up to 1923 these fires were fought by informal bucket brigades, at best. In that year a volunteer fire department was formed, equipped with a cart pulled by hand and chemical pressure tanks.

By 1958 the rail lines still passed through Junction City, but U.S. Route 10 ran through town on Main Street, and trucks and autos were replacing train travel. The village had added several general stores, filling stations and garages, and a weekly newspaper called the &quot;Community Press&quot;. Much of the surrounding land had been converted from stumps to dairy farms.

Around 2012 highway 10 was rerouted north of Junction City, reducing traffic through town.

==History==
The community of Nelsonville began about 1855 when English immigrant Jerome Nelson built a six-foot-high dam spanning the Tomorrow River, with a sawmill across the river from where the flouring mill now stands. After Nelson returned from the Civil War he added the flouring mill in 1868. A post office was added in 1871, named Nelsonville for the mill owner. By 1876 two other businesses were there: the Nelson &amp; Loberg general store, and Peterson Boots and Shoes. Other business started in subsequent years, and the Norwegian Lutheran church in 1888.

By 1913 the community had grown to about 170 people and other businesses included Swenson&#x27;s Furniture Store, Loberg Company Mill, Nelsonville Creamery, and the State Bank of Nelsonville. At this point the community incorporated as a village, in part in an effort to remove saloons that the town of Amherst refused to outlaw. The other high priority was to stop the pasturing of stock on the streets of the village.

<doc id="139599" wikidata="Q1569810" url="?curid=139599" title="Park Falls, Wisconsin">
<text>Park Falls is a city in Price County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 2,410 at the 2020 census, down from 2,462 at 2010. Located in the woods of north central Wisconsin, primarily the Chequamegon National Forest, Park Falls is a small community divided by the North Fork of the Flambeau River, a popular destination for fishing, canoeing and whitewater rafting.

==History ==
The city began in the late 19th century as a small river village called Muskellunge Falls. It was later renamed Park Falls for the scenic beauty surrounding the former falls on the south side of town. With a pulp and paper mill, the town grew rapidly and was incorporated as a city in 1912.

At the height of the city&#x27;s industrial success the city&#x27;s population swelled to more than 4,000 residents. At the same time, commercial development fueled a sizeable downtown, which largely remains today.

Several residential neighborhoods, particularly along 1st Avenue North, were constructed of nearly identical homes, and this affordable housing stock is one of the community&#x27;s lasting assets.

Recent development, which mostly began in the early 1990s, has been primarily concentrated along Wis. Highway 13, a north–south highway that is the city&#x27;s main thoroughfare.

Several governmental offices are located in Park Falls, including a school district, a National Forest Service office, an outpost of the Wisconsin Department of National Resources, and the northern office of the state governor.

<text>Franksville is a former census-designated place (CDP) in Racine County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,789 at the 2000 census.

==History==
Originally occupied by the Potowatomi tribe, the first white settlers in the area then known as Skunk Grove arrived in the 1830s. By the 1850s, plank roads were built through the area, and by the 1870s the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway (Milwaukee Road) laid tracks through the area and a plat was filed with Racine County. This track is now used by the Canadian Pacific Railway as the C&amp;M Subdivision.

In 1907, the Frank Pure Food Company was established and built a plant in Franksville for the purpose of making sauerkraut. Contrary to popular belief, however, the company did not give Franksville its name, which had already been established. The name likely came from either Frank Brandecker, a surveyor who platted the area, or Frank Drandieker, a foreman of the crew that laid the railroad tracks through the area. In 1949, the company held the first Kraut Festival, which was originally a picnic for employees and friends, but later expanded to a 4-day event. The festival&#x27;s run ended in 2002, but was revived in 2015 as Kraut Music Fest.

Franksville became part of the newly established village of Caledonia on March 20, 2006.

==Economy==

In October 2017, Foxconn announced that it would build a $10 billion flat-panel TV campus in Mount Pleasant. Mount Pleasant offered $860 million in tax incentives to attract Foxconn, borrowing funds to do so. Mount Pleasant also declared some residential areas as &#x27;blighted&#x27; to require residents to vacate the project area. Larger landowners were privately offered up to 5x their assessed value, while smaller landowners were later offered 1.4x assessed value at time of assessment, which in some cases ended up being less than actual value. A number of landowners sued to stop the village&#x27;s use of eminent domain laws to benefit a private company. Construction was targeted to begin in the second quarter of 2018. The plan for the campus is to expand in phases over five or more years.

In March 2019, with construction still not started, Foxconn announced that they intend to have a functional plant by the end of 2020, though the plant would be smaller than originally planned.

In November 2020, construction lagged. According to the company, this was due to problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Even with only partial construction, estimates were that Foxconn would be the biggest tax payer in the county. The company has still not made clear exactly what will be produced on the 1,000-acre campus.

In August 2023, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted that the plant &quot;still&quot; wasn&#x27;t built and in a July 2024 article briefly referenced the continued absence of the plant there.

Numerous critics have cited the case of the Foxconn project as an example of some of the most egregious corporate welfare and as an abuse of eminent domain. As reported in &quot;National Review&quot;, &quot;...[the worst] is when governments accompany subsidies with the eminent-domain seizure of citizens’ property...[as with the case of Foxconn in Wisconsin]...&quot;

==Government==
The Village of Mount Pleasant is governed by a six-member board of trustees and a village president. The president and the board are elected at-large for a term of two years per member.

<text>Racine ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Racine County, Wisconsin, United States. It is located on the shore of Lake Michigan at the mouth of the Root River, situated south of Milwaukee and north of Chicago. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 77,816, making it the fifth-most populous city in Wisconsin. It is the principal city of the Racine metropolitan statistical area (consisting only of Racine County, 2020 pop. 197,727). The Racine metropolitan area is, in turn, counted as part of the greater Milwaukee combined statistical area.

Racine is the headquarters of several industries, including Case Corporation heavy equipment, S. C. Johnson &amp; Son cleaning and chemical products, Dremel, Reliance Controls, Twin Disc, and Arthur B. Modine heat exchangers. The Mitchell &amp; Lewis Company, a wagonmaker in the 19th century, began making motorcycles and automobiles as Mitchell-Lewis Motor Company at the start of the 20th century. Racine is also home to InSinkErator, manufacturers of the first garbage disposal. Racine was also historically home to the Horlicks malt factory, where malted milk balls were first developed, and the Western Publishing factory where &quot;Little Golden Books&quot; were printed. Prominent architects in Racine&#x27;s history include A. Arthur Guilbert and Edmund Bailey Funston, and the city is home to some works by renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright.

== History ==

Human prehistory in Racine began with Paleoindians after the last Ice Age. After the arrival of Europeans, the Historic period saw the Miami and later the Potawatomi expand into the area under the pressures of the French fur trade.

In November 1674, while traveling from Green Bay to the territory of the Illinois Confederation, Father Jacques Marquette and his assistants, Jacques Largillier, Pierre Porteret, and Nathan Kowitt camped at the mouth of the Root River. These were the first Europeans known to visit what is now Racine County. Further expeditions were made in the area by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in 1679 and by François Jolliet De Montigny and Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes in 1698. Nearly a century later, in 1791, a trading post would be established along Lake Michigan near where the Root River empties into it.

Following the Black Hawk War, the area surrounding Racine, which had previously been off-limits, was settled by Yankees from upstate New York and New England. In 1834 Captain Gilbert Knapp USRM, who was from Chatham, Massachusetts, founded the settlement of &quot;Port Gilbert&quot; at the place where the Root River empties into Lake Michigan. Knapp had first explored the area of the Root River valley in 1818, and returned with financial backing when the war ended. Within a year of Knapp&#x27;s settlement hundreds of other settlers from New England and western New York had arrived and built log cabins in the area surrounding his own. Some of the settlers were from the town of Derby, Connecticut, and others came from the New England states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. The area was previously called &quot;Kipi Kawi&quot; and &quot;Chippecotton&quot; by the indigenous peoples, both names for the Root River. The name &quot;Port Gilbert&quot; was never really accepted, and in 1841 the community was incorporated as the village of Racine, after the French word for &quot;root&quot;. After Wisconsin was admitted to the Union in 1848, the new legislature voted in August to incorporate Racine as a city.

In 1852, Racine College, an Episcopal college, was founded; it closed in 1933. Its location and many of its buildings are preserved today by the Community of St. Mary as part of the DeKoven Center.

Also in 1852, Racine High School, the first public high school in Wisconsin, opened. The high school operated until 1926, when it was torn down to make way for the new Racine County Courthouse, an Art Deco highrise. Washington Park High School was built to replace the original high school.

Before the Civil War, Racine was well known for its strong opposition to slavery, with many slaves escaping to freedom via the Underground Railroad passing through the city. In 1854 Joshua Glover, an escaped slave who had made a home in Racine, was arrested by federal marshals and jailed in Milwaukee. One hundred men from Racine, and ultimately 5,000 Wisconsinites, rallied and broke into the jail to free him. He was helped to escape to Canada. Glover&#x27;s rescue gave rise to many legal complications and a great deal of litigation. This eventually led to the Wisconsin Supreme Court declaring the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 unconstitutional, and later, the Wisconsin State Legislature refusing to recognize the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court. This saga played a significant role in the building up of tensions that preceded the Civil War.

=== Industry ===
Racine was a factory town almost from the beginning. The first industry in Racine County included the manufacture of fanning mills, machines that separate wheat grain from chaff. Racine also had its share of captains of industry, including J. I. Case (heavy equipment), S. C. Johnson &amp; Son (cleaning and chemical products), and Arthur B. Modine (Heat Exchangers). Racine&#x27;s harbor was central to the shipping industry in Wisconsin in the late 19th century. Racine was also an early car manufacturing center. One of the world&#x27;s first automobiles was built there in 1871 or 1872 by J. W. Cathcart, as was the Pennington Victoria tricycle, the Mitchell, and the Case.

In 1887, malted milk was invented in Racine by English immigrant William Horlick, and Horlicks remains a global brand. The garbage disposal was invented in 1927 by architect John Hammes of Racine, who founded the company InSinkErator, which still produces millions of garbage disposers every year in Racine. Racine is also the home of S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, whose headquarters were designed in 1936 by Frank Lloyd Wright. Wright also designed the Wingspread Conference Center and several homes and other buildings in Racine. The city is also home to the Dremel Corporation, Reliance Controls Corporation and Twin Disc. Case New Holland’s Racine manufacturing facility, which builds two types of tractors (the New Holland T8 and the Case IH Magnum), offers public tours throughout the year.

=== Historic districts and buildings ===
Racine includes the Old Main Street Historic District. Historic buildings in Racine include the Badger Building, Racine Elks Club, Lodge No. 252, St. Patrick&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, YMCA Building, Chauncey Hall House, Eli R. Cooley House, George Murray House, Hansen House, Racine College, McClurg Building, First Presbyterian Church, Memorial Hall, Racine Depot, United Laymen Bible Student Tabernacle, Chauncey Hall Building, Thomas P. Hardy House, and Horlick Field. The area is home to several National Register of Historic Places listed structures: National Register of Historic Places listings in Racine County, Wisconsin. The city is also home to Regency Mall.

Frank Lloyd Wright designed and built the Johnson Wax Headquarters building in Racine. The building was and still is considered a marvel of design innovation, despite its many practical annoyances such as rainwater leaks. Wright urged then-president Hib Johnson to build the structure outside of Racine, a city that Wright, a Wisconsin native, thought of as &quot;backwater.&quot; Johnson refused to have the Johnson Wax Headquarters sited anywhere other than Racine.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

=== Climate ===
Racine has a warm-summer Continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dfb&quot;). Summers are warm and short while winters are cold. Precipitation is dispersed evenly throughout the year, although summers are slightly wetter and more humid than winters.
== Demographics ==


Waves of European immigrants, including Danes, Germans, and Czechs, began to settle in Racine between the Civil War and the First World War. African Americans started arriving in large numbers during World War I, as they did in other Midwestern industrial towns, and Hispanics migrated to Racine from roughly 1925 onward.

Unitarians, Episcopalians and Congregationalists from New England initially dominated Racine&#x27;s religious life. Racine&#x27;s Emmaus Lutheran Church, the oldest Danish Lutheran Church in North America, was founded on August 22, 1851. Originally a founding member of the Danish American Lutheran Church, it has subsequently been a member of the United Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (UDELCA), the American Lutheran Church (ALC), and, since 1988, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). There was also a large Catholic movement to the city, opening up churches for their own ethnicity, such as St. Stanislaus (Polish), St. Rose (Irish), Holy Name (German), St. Patrick (Irish), Sacred Heart (Italian), St. Joseph (German), St. Mary (German), Holy Trinity (Slovak), St. Casimir (Lithuanian), and others. As years passed, populations moved and St. Stanislaus, Holy Name, Holy Trinity, St. Rose, and St. Casimir merged in 1998, forming St. Richard. With new waves of people arriving, older parishes received a boost from the Hispanic community, which formed Cristo Rey, re-energizing St. Patrick&#x27;s into the strong Catholic community of today.
Racine has the largest Danish population in North America. The city has become known for its Danish pastries, particularly kringle. Several local bakeries have been featured on the Food Network highlighting the pastry. In June 2010, President Barack Obama stopped at an O &amp; H Danish Bakery before hosting a town hall meeting on the economy and jobs later that afternoon.

<text>Raymond is a village in Racine County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 3,926 at the 2020 census. The unincorporated communities of Kneeland and Raymond are located in the town, as was the ghost town of Raymond Center. The unincorporated communities of North Cape and Union Church are also located partially in the town.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 35.6 square miles (92.2 km2), of which, 35.6 square miles (92.1 km2) of it is land and 0.04 square miles (0.1 km2) of it (0.06%) is water.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 3,516 people, 1,245 households, and 998 families residing in the town. The population density was 98.8 people per square mile (38.2/km2). There were 1,272 housing units at an average density of 35.8 per square mile (13.8/km2). The racial makeup of the township was 97.95% White, 0.46% African American, 0.28% Native American, 0.51% Asian, 0.09% from other races, and 0.71% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.17% of the population.

There were 1,245 households, out of which 35.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 70.6% were married couples living together, 4.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 19.8% were non-families. 15.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.82 and the average family size was 3.15.

==Switch to village==
In 2019, the Town of Raymond voted to convert to a village. A special law passed to deal with disruptions caused by the promised Foxconn development permitted the town to change status easily without meeting the state&#x27;s standard requirements for incorporation. (Village status prevents the annexation of portions of the town by neighboring municipalities and gives other powers to control development not available under town status.) Four years later, the Village hired its first village administrator, whose position absorbed the duties of the former village clerk.

==Notable people==
* Stephen O. Bennett, Free Soil Party member of the Wisconsin State Assembly and Wisconsin State Senate.
* Martin E. Conlan, member of the South Dakota State Senate.
* John Hansen, Democratic Party member of the Wisconsin State Assembly.

==Education==
===Public schools===
Wind Point is part of the Racine Unified School District. Olympia Brown and North Park elementary schools serve sections of the town, while all residents are zoned to Jerstad-Agerholm K-8 School (formerly Jerstad Middle School) for middle school levels and Horlick High School.

The town&#x27;s only public elementary school, Wind Point Elementary School, which served all of the municipality, opened in 1966. In 2012 it had 237 students, with 50% coming from outside of the school&#x27;s catchment zone; in the previous year it had the lowest enrollment of any of the elementary schools of Racine USD. Ann Laing, the superintendent of Racine USD, characterized the school as having substandard scores on tests.

Wind Point was closed following the 2012–2013 school year. The school board voted for the closure on a 7 to 1 (Julie McKenna being the sole opposing vote) basis, with one board member, Melvin Hargrove, not appearing. McKenna cited her belief that schools with small student populations would be beneficial. The closure resulted in a $600,000 cost savings for Racine USD. Kathryn Poznanski was the school&#x27;s final principal.

The Wind Point Elementary building temporarily housed Mitchell Elementary School students in 2014 after a fire damaged that school&#x27;s permanent campus, but otherwise the school remained unused and the district continued maintaining the building. In 2017 town residents asked the school district to raze the building. In November 2017 the Racine USD school board agreed to have the building given to a limited-liability corporation which would raze the building for fears of vandalism and of perceived poor maintenance. The fixtures and other items in the building were sold in February 2018. Demolition began in April 2018, with housing slated to appear on the former school property.

===Private schools===
A private non-parochial school, The Prairie School, serves students in preschool through 12th grade.

<text>Richland Center is a city in Richland County, Wisconsin, United States that also serves as the county seat. The population was 5,114 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Richland Center was founded in 1851 by Ira S. Haseltine, a native of Andover, Vermont. Haseltine was drawn to the site because of its abundant water power, fertile prairies, and its proximity to the geographical center of Richland County. Haseltine offered to donate land to the county if Richland Center was voted the county seat. In 1852 the Wisconsin Legislature formally declared Richland Center as the seat of justice for Richland County. The present Richland County courthouse was built at Richland Center in 1889.

In 1876, a narrow-gauge railroad branch connected Richland Center with the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railroad at Lone Rock, Wisconsin, providing an outlet for the town&#x27;s commerce. The line was originally constructed with maple rails, but it was rebuilt as a standard gauge iron railway in 1880. On October 8, 1882, the town&#x27;s railway depot was destroyed when an early morning fire ignited two kegs of gunpowder stored inside, causing an explosion that tore the roof from the building and scorched several nearby rail cars. Another passenger depot, built in 1909, still stands today, serving as a visitor center for the community.

Richland Center became an important location for the women&#x27;s suffrage movement in Wisconsin after Laura Briggs James, Julia Bowen, and other residents founded the Richland Center Woman&#x27;s Club in early 1882. The club quickly became the largest suffrage group in the state and was influential in organizing the movement throughout Wisconsin. Susan B. Anthony visited Richland Center in 1886. Later, Laura James&#x27; daughter Ada James became influential in the movement, helping to found the Political Equality League in 1909 and advocating for women&#x27;s rights, pacifism, birth control, and prohibition. Locally, the women&#x27;s club was the driving force behind the construction of the Richland Center City Auditorium, which served as the city hall from 1913 to 1998.

Frank Lloyd Wright was born in Richland Center in 1867. The A. D. German Warehouse, completed in 1921, is the only building designed by Wright in Richland Center and is an early representation of his Mayan Revival style.

The origin of GTE can be traced to the Richland Center Telephone Company. In 1918, three Wisconsin public utility accountants (Sigurd L. Odegard, John A. Pratt, and John F. O&#x27;Connell) purchased the Richland Center Telephone Company for $33,500. At that time, the modest company served only 1,466 telephones in southern Wisconsin. But in 1920, the three accountants formed the Commonwealth Telephone Company and engaged in an aggressive acquisition program, which dramatically expanded its services to more than 500,000 telephones in 25 states. Following bankruptcy during the Great Depression, the company reorganized into the General Telephone Corporation and continued to expand. After merging with Sylvania Electric Products in 1959, it once again changed its name, this time to General Telephone &amp; Electronics Corporation (GT&amp;E, later GTE). By 1969, GTE provided service to 10 million telephones across the nation, making it the largest independent telephone company in the United States.
