<text>Pietro Bembo, (; 20 May 1470 – 18 January 1547) was a Venetian scholar, poet, and literary theorist who also was a member of the Knights Hospitaller, and a cardinal of the Catholic Church. As an intellectual of the Italian Renaissance (15th–16th c.), Pietro Bembo greatly influenced the development of the Tuscan dialect as a literary language for poetry and prose, which, by later codification into a standard language, became the modern Italian language. In the 16th century, Bembo&#x27;s poetry, essays and books proved basic to reviving interest in the literary works of Petrarch. In the field of music, Bembo&#x27;s literary writing techniques helped composers develop the techniques of musical composition that made the madrigal the most important secular music of 16th-century Italy.

==Life==

Pietro Bembo was born on 20 May 1470 to an aristocratic Venetian family. His father Bernardo Bembo (1433–1519) was a diplomat and statesman and a cultured man who cared for the literature of Italy, and erected a monument to Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) in Ravenna. Bernardo Bembo was an ambassador for the Republic of Venice (697–1797), and was accompanied by his son, Pietro. During his father&#x27;s ambassadorships to Florence (1474–1476 and 1478–1480), Pietro acquired a love for the Tuscan dialect, from which the Italian language developed.

Under the tutelage of the neo-Platonist scholar Constantine Lascaris (1434–1501), Pietro Bembo studied Greek language for two years at Messina, and then studied at the University of Padua. His later travels included two years (1497–1499) at the Este court at Ferrara, during the reign of Ercole I d&#x27;Este, Duke of Ferrara (r. 1471–1505). For writers and composers, the city of Ferrara was an artistic centre where Bembo met the poet Ludovico Ariosto (1474–1533); later, in the 1497–1504 period, Bembo wrote his first work, &quot;Gli Asolani&quot; (&quot;The People of Asolo&quot;, 1505), a poetic dialogue about courtly love, which stylistically resembled the writing styles of the humanists Giovanni Boccaccio (1313–1375) and Petrarch (1304–1374). The poems were later set to music, which Bembo preferred to be sung by a woman to the accompaniment of a lute, an artistic wish granted in 1505 when he met Isabella d&#x27;Este (1474–1539) in her response to having received a gift copy of &quot;Gli asolani&quot;.

In the 1502–1503 period, Bembo again was in Ferrara, where he had a love affair with Lucrezia Borgia (1480–1519), wife of Alfonso I d&#x27;Este, Duke of Ferrara (1476–1534), son of the previous duke. In the event, Bembo left the city of Ferrara when Ercole employed Josquin des Prez (1450–1521) as a composer to the chapel; fortuitously, Bembo left town just as the Black Death plague killed most of the population of Ferrara in 1505, including the renowned composer Jacob Obrecht (1457–1505).

In the 1506–1512 period, Bembo resided in Urbino, where he wrote &quot;Prose della volgar lingua&quot; (&quot;Prose of the Vernacular Tongue&quot;, 1525), a treatise about composing and writing poetry in the vernacular language of the Tuscan dialect. He accompanied Giulio di Giuliano de&#x27; Medici (1478–1534) to Rome, where Bembo later was appointed Latin secretary to Pope Leo X (r. 1513–1521), and also was made a member of the Knights Hospitaller, in 1514. At the death of Pope Leo X in 1521, Bembo retired, with impaired health, to Padua and continued to write. In 1530, he accepted the office of official historian of his native Republic of Venice, shortly afterwards, Bembo also was appointed librarian of the basilica of San Marco di Venezia.

On 20 December 1538, Pope Paul III (r. 1534–1549) made Bembo a cardinal &quot;in pectore&quot; (in secret), who then returned to Rome. In 1538, Bembo received Holy Orders as a priest. Afterwards, Bembo&#x27;s secret nomination as cardinal was published, and he then received the red &quot;Galero&quot; hat in a papal consistory on 10 March 1539, with the title of Cardinal Deacon of the church of San Ciriaco alle Terme Diocleziane, which occasion Bembo marked by commissioning a portrait from Titian (1488–1576), the most important painter of the Venetian school. In the event, Cardinal Bembo was advanced to the rank of Cardinal Priest in February 1542, with title to the church of San Crisogono, changed two years later to that of the Basilica of San Clemente. At Rome, Cardinal Bembo continued to write, and revised his earlier works, whilst studying theology and the history of Classical antiquity (A.D. 8th–6th c.). Despite having been rewarded for his successful administration of the dioceses of Gubbio and Bergamo, the Church did not promote Bembo to bishop. In 1547, Pietro Bembo died at the age of 77 years, and was buried in the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva.

==Works and influence==

As a theoretician of literature, Pietro Bembo instilled to the Tuscan dialect the &quot;emotional effect&quot; that the Ancient Greek language (A.D. 9th–6th c.) had upon the Greek listener, by using examples from the classically composed poetry of Petrarch and the prose of Giovanni Boccaccio, whilst foregoing the difficulties of translation and composition inherent to the pluri-lingualism of Dante Alighieri’s writing in &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; (1321). His works may be considered as an early instance of the Petrarchism movement within the Renaissance literature. In the book &quot;Prose della volgar lingua&quot; (&quot;The Prose of the Vernacular Tongue&quot;, 1525) Petrarch is the model of verse composition, and Bembo gives detailed explanations of the communicational functions of rhyme and stress in the sounding of a word and the cadence of a line to achieve a balanced composition. That the specific placement of words within a line in a poem — based upon the writer’s strict attention to the sonic rhythm of vowels and consonant letters — would elicit from the Italian reader and listener the range of human emotions, from grace and sweetness to gravity and grief. Bembo’s rules of poetical composition in &quot;Prose of the Vernacular Tongue&quot; were basic to the development of the techniques of musical composition that made the madrigal Italy’s pre-eminent secular music in the 16th century. His theories of musical composition were disseminated by the Venetian School, by composers such as Adrian Willaert, whose book &quot;Musica nova&quot; (&quot;New Music&quot;, 1568) contains madrigal compositions derived from the linguistic theories of Bembo.

As a writer, in the book &quot;De Ætna ad Angelum Chabrielem Liber&quot; (1496), Bembo tells how he and his father, Bernardo, climbed Mount Ætna and there found snow in summertime, a reality that contradicted the Greek geographer, Strabo, who said that snow was present only in winter; nonetheless, Bembo perceptively notes: “But first-hand inquiry tells you that it lasts, as does practical experience, which is no less an authority.” The typeface for &quot;De Aetna&quot; was the basis for the Monotype Corporation&#x27;s &quot;old-style serif&quot; font called &quot;Bembo&quot;. Bembo&#x27;s edition of &quot;Tuscan Poems&quot; (1501), by Petrarch, and the work of lyric verse &quot;Terze Rime&quot; (1530) much influenced the development of the Tuscan dialect into the literary language of Italy. In &quot;Gli Asolani&quot; (&quot;The People of Asolo&quot;, 1505) Bembo explained and recommended Platonic love as superior to carnal love, despite his love affair with the married Lucrezia Borgia (1480–1519); besides dialogues, poems, and essays, Bembo published a &quot;History of Venice&quot; (1551).

As a priest, Bembo reaffirmed and promoted the Christian perfection of Renaissance humanism. Deriving all from love, or the lack thereof, Bembo&#x27;s schemas were appended as supplements to the newly invented technology of printing by Aldus Manutius in his editions of &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; in the 16th century. Bembo&#x27;s refutation of the pervasive puritanical tendency to a profane dualistic gnosticism is elaborated in &quot;The People of Asolo&quot;, his third prose book, which reconciled fallen human nature by way of Platonic transcendence that is mediated by Trinitarian love; Bembo dedicated that book to his lover Lucrezia Borgia.

<text>Víctor Balaguer i Cirera (; 11 December 1824 – 14 January 1901) was a Spanish politician and author, was born in Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain) on 11 December 1824, and was educated at the university of his native city.

== Biography ==
His first dramatic essay, &quot;Pepín el jorobado&quot;, was placed on the Barcelona stage when he was fourteen years of age, and at nineteen he was publicly &quot;crowned&quot; after the production of his second play, &quot;Don Enrique el Dadivoso&quot;. From 1843 to 1868 he was the chief of the Liberal party in Barcelona, and as proprietor and editor of &quot;El Conseller&quot; did much to promote the growth of Catalan patriotism. But it was not till 1857 that he wrote his first poem in Catalan--a copy of verses to the Virgin of Montserrat. He was the author of &quot;Historia de Cataluña y de la Corona de Aragón&quot; in 5 volumes (Barcelona: Salvador Manero, 1860–63).

Henceforward he frequently adopted the pseudonym of &quot;Lo Trovador de Montserrat&quot;; in 1859 he helped to restore the &quot;Jocs Florals&quot;, and in 1861 was proclaimed &quot;mestre en gay saber&quot;. He was removed to Madrid, took a prominent part in political life, and in 1867 emigrated to Provence.

On the expulsion of Queen Isabella II of Spain, he returned to Spain, represented Manresa in the Cortes, and in 1871—1872 was successively Overseas and Finance minister. He resigned office at the restoration, but finally followed his party in rallying to the dynasty; he was appointed vice-president of Congress, and was subsequently a senator. He died at Madrid on 14 January 1901.

Constantine Lascaris was born in Constantinople, where he was educated by the scholar John Argyropoulos, Gemistus Pletho&#x27;s friend and pupil. After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, he took refuge in Rhodes and then in Italy, where Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan, appointed him Greek tutor to his daughter Hippolyta. Here was published his &quot;Grammatica Graeca, sive compendium octo orationis partium&quot;, remarkable as being probably the first book entirely in Greek issued from the printing press, in 1476.

After leaving Milan in 1465, Lascaris taught in Rome and in Naples, to which he had been summoned by Ferdinand I to deliver a course of lectures on Greece. In the following year, on the invitation of the inhabitants, and especially of Ludovico Saccano, he settled in Messina (Sicily). On the recommendation of Cardinal Bessarion, he was appointed to succeed Andronikos Galaziotes to teach Greek to the Basilian monks of the island. He continued to work in Messina until his death, teaching many pupils who came on purpose to Sicily, from all over Italy, to learn grammar and Greek culture from him.

Among his numerous pupils in Milan was Giorgio Valla and, in Messina, Pietro Bembo, Angelo Gabrieli, Urbano Valeriani, Cola Bruno, Bernardino Rizzo, Francesco Faraone, Antonio Maurolico (the father of Francesco Maurolico), Francesco Giannelli and Cristóbal Escobar. Lascaris bequeathed his library of valuable manuscripts of philosophy, science and magic to the Senate of Messina; the collection, after the Messina revolt (1674-1678), was confiscated and carried to Spain and is now in the Spanish National Library in Madrid. In the second half of the sixteenth century his tomb in Messina was totally destroyed during the repression of the Counter-Reformation. He was a typical Renaissance humanist, with polymathic interests, but especially in Neoplatonism combined with Pythagoreanism (which was dear to many contemporary Byzantine scholars). Through his pupils Antonio Maurolico, Francesco Faraone and Giacomo Notese-Genovese his knowledge reached the scientist Francesco Maurolico.

Lascaris died in Messina in 1501.

==Work==
The &quot;Grammatica&quot;, which has often been reprinted (including the famous Manuzio&#x27;s edition of 1494–1495 with the &quot;Golden Verses&quot; of Pythagoras), is the most valuable work produced by Lascaris. In 1499 at Messina he published the &quot;Vitae illustrium philosophorum siculorum et calabrorum&quot;, with the first Renaissance biography of Pythagoras. Some of his letters are given by Johannes Iriarte in the &quot;Regiae Bibliothecae Matritensis codices Graeci manuscripti&quot; (Madrid, 1769). His name was later known to readers in the romance of Abel-François Villemain, &quot;Lascaris, ou les Grecs du quinzieme siècle&quot; (1825). See also John Edwin Sandys, &quot;Hist. Class. Schol.&quot;, ed. 2, vol. ii (1908), pp. 76 foll.

<text>Alexander Porfiryevich Borodin (; 12 November 183327 February 1887) was a Romantic composer and chemist of Georgian-Russian extraction. He was one of the prominent 19th-century composers known as &quot;The Five&quot;, a group dedicated to producing a &quot;uniquely Russian&quot; kind of classical music. Borodin is known best for his symphonies, his two string quartets, the symphonic poem &quot;In the Steppes of Central Asia&quot; and his opera &quot;Prince Igor&quot;.

A doctor and chemist by profession and training, Borodin made important early contributions to organic chemistry. Although he is presently known better as a composer, he regarded medicine and science as his primary occupations, only practising music and composition in his spare time or when he was ill. As a chemist, Borodin is known best for his work concerning organic synthesis, including being among the first chemists to demonstrate nucleophilic substitution, as well as being the co-discoverer of the aldol reaction. Borodin was a promoter of education in Russia and founded the School of Medicine for Women in Saint Petersburg, where he taught until 1885.

==Life and profession==
===Family and personal life===

Borodin was born in Saint Petersburg as an illegitimate son of a 62-year-old Georgian nobleman, Luka Stepanovich Gedevanishvili, and a married 25-year-old Russian woman, Evdokia Konstantinovna Antonova. Due to the circumstances of Alexander&#x27;s birth, the nobleman had him registered as the son of one of his Russian serfs, Porfiry Borodin, hence the composer&#x27;s Russian last name. As a result of this registration, both Alexander and his nominal Russian father Porfiry were officially serfs of Alexander&#x27;s biological father Luka. The Georgian father emancipated Alexander from serfdom when he was 7 years old and provided housing and money for him and his mother. Despite this, Alexander was never publicly recognized by his mother, who was referred to by young Borodin as his &quot;aunt&quot;.

Despite his status as a commoner, Borodin was well provided for by his Georgian father and grew up in a large four-storey house, which was gifted to Alexander and his &quot;aunt&quot; by the nobleman. Although his registration prevented enrollment in a proper gymnasium, Borodin received good education in all of the subjects through private tutors at home. During 1850 he enrolled in the Medical–Surgical Academy in Saint Petersburg, which was later the workplace of Ivan Pavlov, and pursued a career in chemistry. On graduation he spent a year as surgeon in a military hospital, followed by three years of advanced scientific study in western Europe.

During 1862, Borodin returned to Saint Petersburg to begin a professorship of chemistry at the Imperial Medical-Surgical Academy and spent the remainder of his scientific career in research, lecturing and overseeing the education of others. Eventually, he established medical courses for women in 1872.

He began taking lessons in composition from Mily Balakirev during 1862. He married Ekaterina Protopopova, a pianist, during 1863, with whom he adopted several daughters. Music remained a secondary vocation for Borodin besides his main career as a chemist and physician. He suffered poor health, having overcome cholera and several minor heart failures. He died suddenly during a ball at the academy, and was interred in Tikhvin Cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in Saint Petersburg.

===Career as a chemist===

In his profession Borodin gained great respect, being particularly noted for his work on aldehydes. Between 1859 and 1862 Borodin had a postdoctoral position at Heidelberg University. He worked in the laboratory of Emil Erlenmeyer working on benzene derivatives. He also spent time in Pisa, working on halocarbons. One experiment published during 1862 described the first nucleophilic displacement of chlorine by fluorine in benzoyl chloride. The radical halodecarboxylation of aliphatic carboxylic acids was first demonstrated by Borodin during 1861 by his synthesis of methyl bromide from silver acetate. It was Heinz Hunsdiecker and his wife Cläre, however, who developed Borodin&#x27;s work into a general method, for which they were granted a US patent during 1939, and which they published in the journal &quot;Chemische Berichte&quot; during 1942. The method is generally known as either the Hunsdiecker reaction or the Hunsdiecker–Borodin reaction.

During 1862, Borodin returned to the Medical–Surgical Academy (now known as the S. M. Kirov Military Medical Academy), and accepted a professorship of chemistry. He worked on self-condensation of small aldehydes in a process now known as the aldol reaction, the discovery of which is jointly credited to Borodin and Charles Adolphe Wurtz. Borodin investigated the condensation of valerian aldehyde and oenanth aldehyde, which was reported by von Richter during 1869. During 1873, he described his work to the Russian Chemical Society and noted similarities with compounds recently reported by Wurtz.

He published his last full article during 1875 on reactions of amides and his last publication concerned a method for the identification of urea in animal urine.

His successor as chemistry professor of the Medical-Surgical academy was his son-in-law and fellow chemist, Aleksandr Dianin.

===Musical avocation===
====Opera and orchestral works====
Borodin met Mily Balakirev during 1862. While under Balakirev&#x27;s tutelage in composition he began his Symphony No. 1 in E-flat major; it was first performed during 1869, with Balakirev conducting. During that same year Borodin started on his Symphony No. 2 in B minor, which was not particularly successful at its premiere during 1877 under Eduard Nápravník, but with some minor re-orchestration received a successful performance during 1879 by the Free Music School under Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s direction. During 1880 he composed the popular symphonic poem &quot;In the Steppes of Central Asia&quot;. Two years later he began composing a third symphony, but left it unfinished at his death; two movements of it were later completed and orchestrated by Alexander Glazunov.

During 1868, Borodin became distracted from initial work on the second symphony by preoccupation with the opera &quot;Prince Igor&quot;, which is considered by some to be his most significant work and one of the most important historical Russian operas. It contains the &quot;Polovtsian Dances&quot;, often performed as a stand-alone concert work forming what is probably Borodin&#x27;s best-known composition. Borodin left the opera (and a few other works) incomplete at his death.

&quot;Prince Igor&quot; was completed posthumously by Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Glazunov. It is set in the 12th century, when the Russians, commanded by Prince Igor of Seversk, determined to conquer the barbarous Polovtsians by travelling eastward across the Steppes. The Polovtsians were apparently a nomadic tribe originally of Turkic origin who habitually attacked southern Russia. A full solar eclipse early during the first act foreshadows an ominous outcome to the invasion. Prince Igor&#x27;s troops are defeated. The story tells of the capture of Prince Igor, and his son, Vladimir, of Russia by Polovtsian chief Khan Konchak, who entertains his prisoners lavishly and orders his slaves to perform the famous &#x27;Polovtsian Dances&#x27;, which provide a thrilling climax to the second act. The second half of the opera finds Prince Igor returning to his homeland, but rather than finding himself in disgrace, he is welcomed home by the townspeople and by his wife, Yaroslavna. Although for a while rarely performed in its entirety outside of Russia, this opera has received two notable new productions recently, one at the Bolshoi State Opera and Ballet Company in Russia during 2013, and one at the Metropolitan Opera Company of New York City during 2014.

====Chamber music====
No other member of the Balakirev circle identified himself so much with absolute music as did Borodin in his two string quartets, in addition to his many earlier chamber compositions. As a cellist, he was an enthusiastic chamber music player, an interest that increased during his chemical studies in Heidelberg between 1859 and 1861. This early period yielded, among other chamber works, a string sextet and a piano quintet. Borodin based the thematic structure and instrumental texture of his pieces on those of Felix Mendelssohn.

During 1875 Borodin started his First String Quartet, much to the displeasure of Mussorgsky and Vladimir Stasov; the other members of The Five were known to be hostile to chamber music. The First Quartet demonstrates mastery of the string quartet form. Borodin&#x27;s Second Quartet, written in 1881, displays strong lyricism, as in the third movement&#x27;s popular &quot;Nocturne.&quot; While the First Quartet is richer in changes of mood, the Second Quartet has a more uniform atmosphere and expression.

==Musical legacy==

Borodin&#x27;s fame outside the Russian Empire was made possible during his lifetime by Franz Liszt, who arranged a performance of the Symphony No. 1 in Germany during 1880, and by the Comtesse de Mercy-Argenteau in Belgium and France. His music is noted for its strong lyricism and rich harmonies. Along with some influences from Western composers, as a member of The Five, his music is also characteristic of the Russian style. His passionate music and unusual harmonies proved to have a lasting influence on the younger French composers Debussy and Ravel (in homage, the latter composed during 1913 a piano piece entitled &quot;À la manière de Borodine&quot;).

The evocative characteristics of Borodin&#x27;s music—specifically &quot;In the Steppes of Central Asia&quot;, his Symphony No. 2, &quot;Prince Igor&quot; – made possible the adaptation of his compositions in the 1953 musical &quot;Kismet&quot;, by Robert Wright and George Forrest, notably in the songs &quot;Stranger in Paradise&quot;, &quot;And This Is My Beloved&quot; and &quot;Baubles, Bangles, &amp; Beads&quot;. In 1954, Borodin was posthumously awarded a Tony Award for this show.

<text>Abel-François Villemain (; 9 June 17908 May 1870) was a French politician and writer.

==Biography==
Villemain was born in Paris and educated at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand. He became assistant master at the Lycée Charlemagne, and subsequently at the École Normale. In 1812 he gained a prize from the academy with an essay on Michel de Montaigne. Under the restoration he was appointed, first, assistant professor of modern history, and then professor of French eloquence at the Sorbonne. Here he delivered a series of literary lectures which had an extraordinary effect on his younger contemporaries.

Villemain had the great advantage of coming just before the Romantic movement, of having a wide love of literature without being an extremist. Most of the clever young men of the brilliant generation of 1830 passed under his influence; and, while he pleased the Romanticists by his frank appreciation of the beauties of English, German, Italian, and Spanish poetry, he did not decry the classics—either the classics proper of Greece and Rome or the so-called classics of France.

In 1819 he published a book on Oliver Cromwell, and two years later he was elected to the academy. Villemain was appointed by the restoration government &quot;Chef de l&#x27;imprimerie et de la librairie&quot;, a post involving a kind of irregular censorship of the press, and afterwards to the office of master of requests. Before the July Revolution he had been deprived of his office for his liberal tendencies, and was elected deputy for Évreux in July 1830. Under Louis-Philippe he was made a Peer of France in 1832. He was a member of the council of public instruction, and was twice minister of that department, and he also became secretary of the academy. During the whole of the July Monarchy he was one of the chief dispensers of literary patronage in France, but in his later years his reputation declined. He died in Paris.

His wit was legendary; an anecdote has a fellow professor saying to him &quot;I have discovered a gallicism in Cicero.&quot; The professor had been a revolutionary during the revolution, a follower of Napoleon during the Empire and a royalist during the restauration. Villemain answered quickly to him: &quot;I found one too: «Quantae infidelitates! Quot amicorum fugae!»&quot;

Villemain&#x27;s chief work is his &quot;Cours de la littérature française&quot; (5 vols., 1828–1829). Among his other works are: &quot;Tableau de la littérature au Moyen Âge&quot; (2 vols., 1846); &quot;Tableau de la littérature au XVIII siècle&quot; (4 vols., 1864); &quot;Souvenirs contemporains&quot; (2 vols., 1856); &quot;Histoire de Grégoire VII&quot; (2 vols., 1873; Engl. trans., 1874).

Lautréamont assessed him thus: &quot;Villemain is thirty-four times more intelligent than Eugène Sue and Frédéric Soulié. His preface to the &quot;Dictionary of the Academy&quot; will outlive the novels of Walter Scott and Fenimore Cooper, and all the novels conceivable and imaginable.&quot;

Among notices on Villemain may be cited that of Louis de Loménie (1841), E. Mirecourt (1858), J.L. Dubut (1875). See also Sainte-Beuve, &quot;Portraits&quot; (1841, vol. iii), and &quot;Causeries du lundi&quot; (vol. xi, &quot;Notes et pensées&quot;).

<doc id="143608" wikidata="Q961202" url="?curid=143608" title="Deferent and epicycle">
<text>In the Hipparchian, Ptolemaic, and Copernican systems of astronomy, the epicycle (, meaning &quot;circle moving on another circle&quot;) was a geometric model used to explain the variations in speed and direction of the apparent motion of the Moon, Sun, and planets. In particular it explained the apparent retrograde motion of the five planets known at the time. Secondarily, it also explained changes in the apparent distances of the planets from the Earth.

It was first proposed by Apollonius of Perga at the end of the 3rd century BC. It was developed by Apollonius of Perga and Hipparchus of Rhodes, who used it extensively, during the 2nd century BC, then formalized and extensively used by Ptolemy in his 2nd century AD astronomical treatise the &quot;Almagest&quot;.

Epicyclical motion is used in the Antikythera mechanism, [citation requested] an ancient Greek astronomical device, for compensating for the elliptical orbit of the Moon, moving faster at perigee and slower at apogee than circular orbits would, using four gears, two of them engaged in an eccentric way that quite closely approximates Kepler&#x27;s second law.

Epicycles worked very well and were highly accurate, because, as Fourier analysis later showed, any smooth curve can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy with a sufficient number of epicycles. However, they fell out of favor with the discovery that planetary motions were largely elliptical from a heliocentric frame of reference, which led to the discovery that gravity obeying a simple inverse square law could better explain all planetary motions.

==Introduction==

In both Hipparchian and Ptolemaic systems, the planets are assumed to move in a small circle called an &quot;epicycle&quot;, which in turn moves along a larger circle called a &quot;deferent&quot; (Ptolemy himself described the point but did not give it a name). Both circles rotate eastward and are roughly parallel to the plane of the Sun&#x27;s apparent orbit under those systems (ecliptic). Despite the fact that the system is considered geocentric, neither of the circles were centered on the earth, rather each planet&#x27;s motion was centered at a planet-specific point slightly away from the Earth called the &quot;eccentric&quot;. The orbits of planets in this system are similar to epitrochoids, but are not exactly epitrochoids because the angle of the epicycle is not a linear function of the angle of the deferent.

In the Hipparchian system the epicycle rotated and revolved along the deferent with uniform motion. However, Ptolemy found that he could not reconcile that with the Babylonian observational data available to him; in particular, the shape and size of the apparent retrogrades differed. The angular rate at which the epicycle traveled was not constant unless he measured it from another point which is now called the &quot;equant&quot; (Ptolemy did not give it a name). It was the angular rate at which the deferent moved around the point midway between the equant and the Earth (the eccentric) that was constant; the epicycle center swept out equal angles over equal times only when viewed from the equant. It was the use of equants to decouple uniform motion from the center of the circular deferents that distinguished the Ptolemaic system. For the outer planets, the angle between the center of the epicycle and the planet was the same as the angle between the Earth and the Sun.

Ptolemy did not predict the relative sizes of the planetary deferents in the &quot;Almagest&quot;. All of his calculations were done with respect to a normalized deferent, considering a single case at a time. This is not to say that he believed the planets were all equidistant, but he had no basis on which to measure distances, except for the Moon. He generally ordered the planets outward from the Earth based on their orbit periods. Later he calculated their distances in the &quot;Planetary Hypotheses&quot; and summarized them in the first column of this table:
Had his values for deferent radii relative to the Earth–Sun distance been more accurate, the epicycle sizes would have all approached the Earth–Sun distance. Although all the planets are considered separately, in one peculiar way they were all linked: the lines drawn from the body through the epicentric center of all the planets were all parallel, along with the line drawn from the Sun to the Earth along which Mercury and Venus were situated. That means that all the bodies revolve in their epicycles in lockstep with Ptolemy&#x27;s Sun (that is, they all have exactly a one-year period).

Babylonian observations showed that for superior planets the planet would typically move through in the night sky slower than the stars. Each night the planet appeared to lag a little behind the stars, in what is called prograde motion. Near opposition, the planet would appear to reverse and move through the night sky faster than the stars for a time in retrograde motion before reversing again and resuming prograde. Epicyclic theory, in part, sought to explain this behavior.

The inferior planets were always observed to be near the Sun, appearing only shortly before sunrise or shortly after sunset. Their apparent retrograde motion occurs during the transition between evening star into morning star, as they pass between the Earth and the Sun.

==History==
When ancient astronomers viewed the sky, they saw the Sun, Moon, and stars moving overhead in a regular fashion. Babylonians did celestial observations, mainly of the Sun and Moon as a means of recalibrating and preserving timekeeping for religious ceremonies. Other early civilizations such as the Greeks had thinkers like Thales of Miletus, the first to document and predict a solar eclipse (585 BC), or Heraclides Ponticus. They also saw the &quot;wanderers&quot; or &quot;planetai&quot; (our planets). The regularity in the motions of the wandering bodies suggested that their positions might be predictable.

The most obvious approach to the problem of predicting the motions of the heavenly bodies was simply to map their positions against the star field and then to fit mathematical functions to the changing positions. The introduction of better celestial measurement instruments, such as the introduction of the gnomon by Anaximander, allowed the Greeks to have a better understanding of the passage of time, such as the number of days in a year and the length of seasons, which are indispensable for astronomic measurements.

The ancients worked from a geocentric perspective for the simple reason that the Earth was where they stood and observed the sky, and it is the sky which appears to move while the ground seems still and steady underfoot. Some Greek astronomers (e.g., Aristarchus of Samos) speculated that the planets (Earth included) orbited the Sun, but the optics (and the specific mathematics – Isaac Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation for example) necessary to provide data that would convincingly support the heliocentric model did not exist in Ptolemy&#x27;s time and would not come around for over fifteen hundred years after his time. Furthermore, Aristotelian physics was not designed with these sorts of calculations in mind, and Aristotle&#x27;s philosophy regarding the heavens was entirely at odds with the concept of heliocentrism. It was not until Galileo Galilei observed the moons of Jupiter on 7 January 1610, and the phases of Venus in September 1610, that the heliocentric model began to receive broad support among astronomers, who also came to accept the notion that the planets are individual worlds orbiting the Sun (that is, that the Earth is a planet, too). Johannes Kepler formulated his three laws of planetary motion, which describe the orbits of the planets in the Solar System to a remarkable degree of accuracy utilizing a system that employs elliptical rather than circular orbits. Kepler&#x27;s three laws are still taught today in university physics and astronomy classes, and the wording of these laws has not changed since Kepler first formulated them four hundred years ago.

The apparent motion of the heavenly bodies with respect to time is cyclical in nature. Apollonius of Perga (3rd century BC) realized that this cyclical variation could be represented visually by small circular orbits, or &quot;epicycles&quot;, revolving on larger circular orbits, or &quot;deferents&quot;. Hipparchus (2nd century BC) calculated the required orbits. Deferents and epicycles in the ancient models did not represent orbits in the modern sense, but rather a complex set of circular paths whose centers are separated by a specific distance in order to approximate the observed movement of the celestial bodies.

Claudius Ptolemy refined the deferent-and-epicycle concept and introduced the equant as a mechanism that accounts for velocity variations in the motions of the planets. The empirical methodology he developed proved to be extraordinarily accurate for its day and was still in use at the time of Copernicus and Kepler. A heliocentric model is not necessarily more accurate as a system to track and predict the movements of celestial bodies than a geocentric one when considering strictly circular orbits. A heliocentric system would require more intricate systems to compensate for the shift in reference point. It was not until Kepler&#x27;s proposal of elliptical orbits that such a system became increasingly more accurate than a mere epicyclical geocentric model.

Owen Gingerich describes a planetary conjunction that occurred in 1504 and was apparently observed by Copernicus. In notes bound with his copy of the &quot;Alfonsine Tables&quot;, Copernicus commented that &quot;Mars surpasses the numbers by more than two degrees. Saturn is surpassed by the numbers by one and a half degrees.&quot; Using modern computer programs, Gingerich discovered that, at the time of the conjunction, Saturn indeed lagged behind the tables by a degree and a half and Mars led the predictions by nearly two degrees. Moreover, he found that Ptolemy&#x27;s predictions for Jupiter at the same time were quite accurate. Copernicus and his contemporaries were therefore using Ptolemy&#x27;s methods and finding them trustworthy well over a thousand years after Ptolemy&#x27;s original work was published.

When Copernicus transformed Earth-based observations to heliocentric coordinates, he was confronted with an entirely new problem. The Sun-centered positions displayed a cyclical motion with respect to time but without retrograde loops in the case of the outer planets. In principle, the heliocentric motion was simpler but with new subtleties due to the yet-to-be-discovered elliptical shape of the orbits. Another complication was caused by a problem that Copernicus never solved: correctly accounting for the motion of the Earth in the coordinate transformation. In keeping with past practice, Copernicus used the deferent/epicycle model in his theory but his epicycles were small and were called &quot;epicyclets&quot;.

In the Ptolemaic system the models for each of the planets were different, and so it was with Copernicus&#x27; initial models. As he worked through the mathematics, however, Copernicus discovered that his models could be combined in a unified system. Furthermore, if they were scaled so that the Earth&#x27;s orbit was the same in all of them, the ordering of the planets we recognize today easily followed from the math. Mercury orbited closest to the Sun and the rest of the planets fell into place in order outward, arranged in distance by their periods of revolution.

Although Copernicus&#x27; models reduced the magnitude of the epicycles considerably, whether they were simpler than Ptolemy&#x27;s is moot. Copernicus eliminated Ptolemy&#x27;s somewhat-maligned equant but at a cost of additional epicycles. Various 16th-century books based on Ptolemy and Copernicus use about equal numbers of epicycles. The idea that Copernicus used only 34 circles in his system comes from his own statement in a preliminary unpublished sketch called the &quot;Commentariolus&quot;. By the time he published &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot;, he had added more circles. Counting the total number is difficult, but estimates are that he created a system just as complicated, or even more so. Koestler, in his history of man&#x27;s vision of the universe, equates the number of epicycles used by Copernicus at 48. The popular total of about 80 circles for the Ptolemaic system seems to have appeared in 1898. It may have been inspired by the &quot;non-Ptolemaic&quot; system of Girolamo Fracastoro, who used either 77 or 79 orbs in his system inspired by Eudoxus of Cnidus. Copernicus in his works exaggerated the number of epicycles used in the Ptolemaic system; although original counts ranged to 80 circles, by Copernicus&#x27;s time the Ptolemaic system had been updated by Peurbach toward the similar number of 40; hence Copernicus effectively replaced the problem of retrograde with further epicycles.

Copernicus&#x27; theory was at least as accurate as Ptolemy&#x27;s but never achieved the stature and recognition of Ptolemy&#x27;s theory. What was needed was Kepler&#x27;s elliptical-orbit theory, not published until 1609 and 1619. Copernicus&#x27; work provided explanations for phenomena like retrograde motion, but really did not prove that the planets actually orbited the Sun.

Ptolemy&#x27;s and Copernicus&#x27; theories proved the durability and adaptability of the deferent/epicycle device for representing planetary motion. The deferent/epicycle models worked as well as they did because of the extraordinary orbital stability of the solar system. Either theory could be used today had Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Isaac Newton not invented calculus.

According to Maimonides, the now-lost astronomical system of Ibn Bajjah in 12th century Andalusian Spain lacked epicycles. Gersonides of 14th century France also eliminated epicycles, arguing that they did not align with his observations. Despite these alternative models, epicycles were not eliminated until the 17th century, when Johannes Kepler&#x27;s model of elliptical orbits gradually replaced Copernicus&#x27; model based on perfect circles.

Newtonian or classical mechanics eliminated the need for deferent/epicycle methods altogether and produced more accurate theories. By treating the Sun and planets as point masses and using Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation, equations of motion were derived that could be solved by various means to compute predictions of planetary orbital velocities and positions. If approximated as simple two-body problems, for example, they could be solved analytically, while the more realistic n-body problem required numerical methods for solution.

The power of Newtonian mechanics to solve problems in orbital mechanics is illustrated by the discovery of Neptune. Analysis of observed perturbations in the orbit of Uranus produced estimates of the suspected planet&#x27;s position within a degree of where it was found. This could not have been accomplished with deferent/epicycle methods. Still, Newton in 1702 published &quot;Theory of the Moon&#x27;s Motion&quot; which employed an epicycle and remained in use in China into the nineteenth century. Subsequent tables based on Newton&#x27;s &quot;Theory&quot; could have approached arcminute accuracy.

==The number of epicycles==
According to one school of thought in the history of astronomy, minor imperfections in the original Ptolemaic system were discovered through observations accumulated over time. It was mistakenly believed that more levels of epicycles (circles within circles) were added to the models to match more accurately the observed planetary motions. The multiplication of epicycles is believed to have led to a nearly unworkable system by the 16th century, and that Copernicus created his heliocentric system in order to simplify the Ptolemaic astronomy of his day, thus succeeding in drastically reducing the number of circles.

As a measure of complexity, the number of circles is given as 80 for Ptolemy, versus a mere 34 for Copernicus. The highest number appeared in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; on Astronomy during the 1960s, in a discussion of King Alfonso X of Castile&#x27;s interest in astronomy during the 13th century. (Alfonso is credited with commissioning the Alfonsine Tables.)

As it turns out, a major difficulty with this epicycles-on-epicycles theory is that historians examining books on Ptolemaic astronomy from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance have found absolutely no trace of multiple epicycles being used for each planet. The Alfonsine Tables, for instance, were apparently computed using Ptolemy&#x27;s original unadorned methods.

Another problem is that the models themselves discouraged tinkering. In a deferent-and-epicycle model, the parts of the whole are interrelated. A change in a parameter to improve the fit in one place would throw off the fit somewhere else. Ptolemy&#x27;s model is probably optimal in this regard. On the whole it gave good results but missed a little here and there. Experienced astronomers would have recognized these shortcomings and allowed for them.

==Mathematical formalism==
According to the historian of science Norwood Russell Hanson:
Any path—periodic or not, closed or open—can be represented with an infinite number of epicycles. This is because epicycles can be represented as a complex Fourier series; therefore, with a large number of epicycles, very complex paths can be represented in the complex plane.

Let the complex number

where and are constants, formula_1 is the imaginary unit, and is time, correspond to a deferent centered on the origin of the complex plane and revolving with a radius and angular velocity

where is the period.

If is the path of an epicycle, then the deferent plus epicycle is represented as the sum

This is an almost periodic function, and is a periodic function just when the ratio of the constants is rational. Generalizing to epicycles yields the almost periodic function

which is periodic just when every pair of is rationally related. Finding the coefficients to represent a time-dependent path in the complex plane, , is the goal of reproducing an orbit with deferent and epicycles, and this is a way of &quot;saving the phenomena&quot; (σώζειν τα φαινόμενα).

This parallel was noted by Giovanni Schiaparelli. Pertinent to the Copernican Revolution&#x27;s debate about &quot;saving the phenomena&quot; versus offering explanations, one can understand why Thomas Aquinas, in the 13th century, wrote:

==Epicycles and the Catholic Church==
Being a system that was for the most part used to justify the geocentric model, with the exception of Copernicus&#x27; cosmos, the deferent and epicycle model was favored over the heliocentric ideas that Kepler and Galileo proposed. Later adopters of the epicyclic model such as Tycho Brahe, who considered the Church&#x27;s scriptures when creating his model, were seen even more favorably. The Tychonic model was a hybrid model that blended the geocentric and heliocentric characteristics, with a still Earth that has the sun and moon surrounding it, and the planets orbiting the Sun. To Brahe, the idea of a revolving and moving Earth was impossible, and the scripture should be always paramount and respected. When Galileo tried to challenge Tycho Brahe&#x27;s system, the church was dissatisfied with their views being challenged. Galileo&#x27;s publication did not aid his case in his trial.

==Bad science==
&quot;Adding epicycles&quot; has come to be used as a derogatory comment in modern scientific discussion. The term might be used, for example, to describe continuing to try to adjust a theory to make its predictions match the facts. There is a generally accepted idea that extra epicycles were invented to alleviate the growing errors that the Ptolemaic system noted as measurements became more accurate, particularly for Mars. According to this notion, epicycles are regarded by some as the paradigmatic example of bad science.

Copernicus added an extra epicycle to his planets, but that was only in an effort to eliminate Ptolemy&#x27;s equant, which he considered a philosophical break away from Aristotle&#x27;s perfection of the heavens. Mathematically, the second epicycle and the equant produce nearly the same results, and many Copernican astronomers before Kepler continued using the equant, as the mathematical calculations were easier. Copernicus&#x27; epicycles were also much smaller than Ptolemy&#x27;s, and were required because the planets in his model moved in perfect circles. Johannes Kepler would later show that the planets move in ellipses, which removed the need for Copernicus&#x27; epicycles as well.

<doc id="143612" wikidata="Q71080" url="?curid=143612" title="Province of Salamanca">
<text>Salamanca () is a province of western Spain, in the western part of the autonomous community of Castile and León (Castilla y León). It is bordered by the provinces of Zamora, Valladolid, Ávila, and Cáceres, and on the west by Portugal. It has an area of 12,349 km2 and in 2018 had a population of 331,473 people. It is divided into 362 municipalities, 11 comarcas, 32 mancomunidades and five judicial districts. Of the 362 municipalities, more than half are villages with fewer than 300 people.

==History==
The Vettones occupied the areas of the current Spanish provinces of Salamanca and Ávila, as well as parts of Cáceres, Toledo and Zamora. They were a pre-Roman people of Celtic culture. Their numerous archaeological sites exist throughout the province, and several locality names have Vettone origin, some of which are quite important. This is the case of Salamanca (&quot;Salmantica&quot;), Ledesma (&quot;Bletisama&quot;) and Ciudad Rodrigo (&quot;Augustobriga&quot;). Vettone villages were often established on the banks of rivers or on mountains. Examples include Salamanca and Ledesma, built along the Tormes, Bermellar, El Castillo (Saldeana) Moncalvo (Hinojosa de Duero), Picon de la Mora (Picones) and Castro de Yecla la Vieja (Yecla de Yeltes) next to Huebra, Ciudad Rodrigo, Irueña (Fuenteguinaldo) and Lerilla (Zamarra) on the banks of the Agueda and Castro de Las Merchanas (Lumbrales), in a loop of the Camaces. The area between La Armuña and Salamanca marked the border between Vettones and Vaccaei, the other pre-Roman people of the province. They were situated in the northeast area of the province.

==Geography==
Salamanca Province is situated in western Spain, in the western part of Castile and León. It has an average altitude of 823 meters, but there are large variations throughout the province, with being the highest point at the peak of the Ceja Canchal in the Sierra de Béjar range, and being the lowest point in the valley of the Salto de Saucelle. Also of note is the Sierra de Francia mountain range. The Salamanca hydrographic network is mainly formed by the Duero basin. The most important rivers are the Duero, Tormes, Águeda, Huebra, and Yeltes rivers.

The region is well-irrigated with a number of dams and reservoirs, and with more than 3,400 million cubic meters, it is the province with the third highest water storage capacity in Spain, second only to the Province of Badajoz and the Province of Cáceres. Of particular note is the Almendra Dam, five kilometres from the village of Almendra. Constructed between 1964 and 1970, the dam forms part of the hydroelectric system known as &quot;the Duero Drops&quot;, along with the Castro, Ricobayo, Saucelle and Villalcampo. It is one of the largest reservoirs in Spain with an area of and 2.5 billion cubic metres of water. The dam itself is more than half a kilometre wide and, at a height of , it is one of Spain&#x27;s tallest structures.

==Population development==
The historical population is given in the following chart:
==Landmarks==
There are Roman Catholic cathedrals at Salamanca and Ciudad Rodrigo. The Old Cathedral of Salamanca was founded by Bishop Jerome of Périgord, in the 12th century and completed in Romanesque/Gothic style in the 14th century. It is dedicated to Santa Maria de la Sede (Saint Mary of the See). The New Cathedral of Salamanca was constructed between the 16th and 18th centuries in the Late Gothic and Baroque styles. Building began in 1513 and the cathedral was consecrated in 1733. It was commissioned by Ferdinand V of Castile of Spain. It was declared a national monument by royal decree in 1887.

<text>Valladolid () is a province of northwest Spain, in the central part of the autonomous community of Castile and León. It has a population of 525,398 people in a total of 225 municipalities, an area of and a population density of 64.77 people per km2.

The capital is the city of Valladolid. It is bordered by the provinces of Zamora, León, Palencia, Burgos, Segovia, Ávila, and Salamanca. It is thus the only Spanish province surrounded entirely by other provinces of the same autonomous community. It is the only peninsular province which has no mountains.

Because the extensive plain on which the province lies is important to overland transport, it is a major communications hub. From a national point of view it connects Madrid with the north of Spain, from Vigo in Galicia to San Sebastián in the Basque Country, and from an international point of view, it is on the shortest land route connecting Porto in the north of Portugal with Hendaye in the south of France.

The cuisine of the province is like that of Castile—meats and roasts occupy a central place. One of the most typical dishes is lechazo, a dish made from unweaned lambs, similar to veal. Suckling pig, black pudding, sausages and sheep&#x27;s milk cheeses and breads are also traditional. The province has five wines with a denomination of origin.

The province once served as the capital of the Castilian court and the former capital of the Empire during the reigns of Emperor Carlos I, Philip II and Philip III, which explains why to this day it remains pregnant with castles and strongholds. The capital has an important historical – artistic heritage and one of the more important museums of sculpture of Europe. The province of Valladolid is specially recognized for its processions of Holy Week, as much in the capital as in the localities of Medina de Rioseco and Medina del Campo. In addition, the province has two UNESCO world heritage sites within its category Memory of the World Programme: the Treaty of Tordesillas and the Archivo General de Simancas.

== History ==


The province of Valladolid was established as such by the Royal Decree of 29 September 1833 driven by the minister Javier de Burgos, being attached to the historic region of Old Castile.

The first stable population that settled in the present province were the pre-Roman Vaccaei people (Spanish name: vacceos, the area that they inhabited is called &quot;Región Vaccea&quot;) who belonged to a very advanced culture when the rest of the Celtic peoples arrived in the peninsula from the north of Europe (there is evidence that indicates that they also occupied territories corresponding to other provinces). By then, it was already defined for the chronicles as a region &quot;free and discovered&quot; and &quot;an open country, wheat fields, deforested land&quot; and the vacceos were involved in livestock farming and especially agriculture (cereals).

In the year 178 BC, the Romans conquered the territory. Thus the lands that make up the current province came under their occupation, up to the barbarian invasions of the early fifth century AD when the province came under the control of the new Visigothic Kingdom.

After the invasion of the Iberian peninsula by the Muslims in the year 711, the Muslims arrived in these lands just a year later, in 712. Later, during the Reconquista, this area was the subject of battles between the Muslims and the Christian Kingdom of León in the first half of the eleventh century. In 939, after the Battle of Simancas clinched the domain of the basin of the Douro river by the Christian kingdoms. Valladolid was founded in the year 1072 by Count Pedro Ansúrez. From here its history was linked to that of the Crown of Castile. In fact, cities such as Medina del Campo or Valladolid became important administrative centers Castilians and also experienced an economic boom (mesta, fairs ... ).

Had a great importance in the Discovery of the Americas in 1492 (Christopher Columbus will end up living the last years of his life until his death in 1506 in Valladolid) and the subsequent colonization with explorers such as Juan Ponce de León -discoverer of the Florida (United States)-. In fact, in some houses of Tordesillas, was signed the Treaty of Tordesillas which decided to the cast of the New World between the Catholic Monarchs and the Kingdom of Portugal giving rise to Latin America.

The revolt of the comuneros in the year 1520, which ended with the ringleaders of that revolt publicly executed in Villalar de los Comuneros. Valladolid became the capital of the Spanish empire between the years 1601–1606. When the Spanish Empire began to decline due to the continuing wars in which this involved and the emergence of new emerging powers, there was an economic decline in the area, as in the rest of the Spanish monarchy. During the War of the Spanish Succession (1700–1715) It positioned the side of the Bourbon pretender, that would be the one who got the throne. In the Peninsular War against France (1808–1814), there were a succession of small battles and the continued action of guerrillas as &quot;The Undaunted&quot;.

In the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) Valladolid was the &quot;most significant regional nucleus&quot; of Falangism in the Spanish Second Republic, garnering the second-highest provincial vote for the party in the otherwise dismal (for Falangists) elections of 1936, just behind Cadiz. The province was controlled by Franco&#x27;s Nationalists throughout the Civil War. During the Franco period there was an exodus from the rural countryside to the industrial cities. A further exodus occurred with the arrival of democracy in Spain (early 1980s), when the province was made part of the new autonomous community of Castile and Leon.

Start a process of economic growth that peaked with the Spanish property bubble and then suffers from the economic crisis of 2008-2015, like the rest of the south of Europe. Subsequently, there was a certain economic growth until 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic caused the declaration of a state of alarm throughout Spain, resulting in a strong economic standstill. After the lifting of the confinement measures, economic activity was reactivated.

== Geography ==

It is bordered by the provinces of Burgos, Palencia and Leon to the north, with Zamora, to the west; with the provinces of Salamanca and Avila to the south; and with the province of Segovia to the east. It is, therefore, the only Spanish province surrounded only – and entirely – by others in your same autonomous community (Castile and León).

The province of Valladolid covers an area of ,4 is located in the center of the Meseta Central, a plateau in the middle of the northern half of the Iberian Peninsula and is characterized by its uniform terrain (777 metres on average with a maximum difference in altitude of 300 metres), making it the most geographically homogeneous province in Spain. The Douro river, which crosses it from east to west, becomes the backbone of the territory.

It is dominated by an extensive plain in which are distinguished: A moorlands fells area defined by the valleys of different rivers, some of which stand out in altitude causing a mountainous landscape of hills witnesses, such as the Montes Torozos, San Cristobal hill (843 m) and the Sardanedo (854 m); a countryside location of soft hills; and by separating one and another, the so-called &quot;hills&quot;, deep gorges with steep slopes, such as the width of Prado, Santovenia, Cabezon de Pisuerga, etc...

It is the only peninsular province with absolutely no mountains (obviously it has no coastline either), and also - together with the province of Almería - the one with the least wooded area (less than 16% of the territory). The highest point is in Castrillo de Duero and is the Cuchillejos hill (933 m). The lowest point is the Douro river passing by Villafranca de Duero (626 m). Therefore, it is also the only province of Castile and León that does not reach 1000 m above sea level at any point in its territory.

Hydrographic network dominated by the Douro River and its tributaries (Pisuerga, Esgueva, Adaja, Eresma, Duratón, Zapardiel and Cega, among others) and completed with the Canal de Castilla and the Canal of Douro. There is only one relevant lake: Laguna de Duero. The province has four reservoirs: Encinas de Esgueva, San José, Bajoz and Valdemudarra, all built in the 20th century, except for the last one which was built in the first decade of the 21st century.

=== Climate ===
The Continental Mediterranean climate is typical of Meseta Central, which is located in the province of Valladolid. It is similar to the typical Mediterranean but with characteristics of continental climates, of more extreme temperatures, although it does not go to be as different as to be classified separately. In addition this climate does not receive the influence of the sea, that is why the temperatures are the most extreme of Spain, with a lot of heat summers and winters quite cold with a swing of 18.5 Cº. According to the Köppen climate classification, the main climate in the province in the 1981-2010 reference period is of type &quot;Csa&quot; (Hot-summer Mediterranean climate) and type &quot;Csb&quot; (Warm-summer Mediterranean climate).

Summer is the driest season and can overcome with great frequency 30 °C, reaching sporadically over 35 °C. However, in winter it is frequent that the temperatures fall to 0 °C, producing ice in cloudless nights and snow sporadically. When frost combines with fog, that is called hard rime, a very characteristic phenomenon of the area, like frost. This northern region of Spain, along with the rest of the provinces of Castile and Leon, is the coldest region in South Europe.


Rainfall follows a very similar pattern to that of the typical Mediterranean climate, reaching between 400 and 600 mm, with a peak during Spring and Autumn. The declining influence of the sea, however, makes it a drier climate than the typical. In the province of Valladolid the continental Mediterranean climate has temperatures approximately two degrees higher than in the rest of the areas with this climate, mainly due to the scarcity of mountains in this province and the altitude, which is between 50 and 200 meters lower on average than in the whole of Castilla y León.

Therefore, the province of Valladolid has the most comfortable climate of all the northern plateau, with an average annual temperature of 11.8Cº. Its average annual rainfall ranges between 400 and 600 millimeters per year, distributed throughout the year with a fairly strong minimum in summer and a very attenuated winter minimum, the rainfall in the province of Valladolid does not usually arrive in large quantities and in a torrential manner, the rainfall in the province of Valladolid arrives in a gentle manner and over several days, which favors the countryside.

The extreme weather values recorded at either of the two State Meteorological Agency (AEMet) observatories in the province are 40.2 °C recorded on July 19, 1995 at the Valladolid observatory and -18.8 °C recorded at the Villanubla observatory on January 3, 1971, as far as temperatures are concerned. The strongest wind gust recorded was 133 km/h on January 24, 1971, while the maximum accumulated precipitation in a single day was 90.8 l/m² on December 5, 1951.

The typically Castilian bread receives the name of &quot;Candeal bread&quot;, &quot;sobao o bregado&quot; (&quot;sobao or labored&quot;), because since remote times in Castile the wheat variety most used is the durum. It is a thin crust of bread and lightly toast, miga very white and compact with a fine texture and distinctive flavor.

Traditionally it is made by hand, with an amassed slow fermentation and a prolonged, finished cooking in the wood-fired oven.

Under this denomination, fall different varieties; among them the most prominent is the variety of &quot;lechuguino bread&quot;, characterized by its typical drawing and care that gives the name to the variety, since it was formerly known as, especially in rural areas, &quot;lechuguino&quot; to those people who were overly arranged.

Other varieties are the typical bread of four beds, with a characteristic splitting of the earth on which the central part is separated from the four masons or edges, the bread of tables, the bread of pulley, with a slit made with a string that imitates a pulley, the white bar or peaks and the Fabiola, created in 1961 by a baker from Valladolid in honor of Queen Fabiola of Belgium.

In handball, BM Atlético Valladolid replaced BM Valladolid (winner of two King&#x27;s Cups, one ASOBAL Cup and one EHF Cup Winners&#x27; Cup). There is also a women&#x27;s handball team, BM Aula Cultural. Valladolid is also known as a national center for rugby, with two of the top teams of the league División de Honor de Rugby: CR El Salvador and Valladolid RAC, which between the two have won twenty-one National League Championships, fourteen King&#x27;s Cups and fourteen Spanish Supercups.

<text>Zamora () is a province of western Spain, in the western part of the autonomous community of Castile and León. It is bordered by the provinces of Ourense, León, Valladolid, and Salamanca, and by Portugal.

The present-day province of Zamora was one of three provinces formed from the former Kingdom of León in 1833, when Spain was reorganized into 49 provinces. Of the 174,549 people (2018) in the province, nearly a third live in the capital, Zamora. This province has 250 municipalities.

==Geography==


The Province of Zamora is in northwestern Spain where it borders on Portugal, which lies to the southwest. To the west lies the province of Ourense, to the north lies León, to the east lies Valladolid, and to the south lies Salamanca. The River Esla rises in the Cantabrian Mountains in the north and flows southwards through the province before joining the River Douro (Spanish: el Duero) which then forms part of the boundary with Portugal. The Esla is the largest tributary of the Duero and where they join, discharges a greater quantity of water than that discharged by the Duero. The capital of the province is Zamora which is situated in the south of the province on the banks of the Duero.

The province has a total area of . Its economy is largely agricultural and it has a tradition of sheep rearing, producing a large proportion of Spain&#x27;s merino wool.

==Population==
The historical population is given in the following chart:
==History==
A megalithic culture developed in this region of Spain, particularly around Aliste, and there are many remaining signs of the presence of various cultures over the years. Salt mining took place at Villafáfila, stone forts were built on fertile plains and near rivers, and others were built in the vicinity of mines where variscite and iron ore were extracted. Rock paintings have been discovered and artefacts found include everyday pottery, tools, and gold and silver jewellery. In the Iron Age, Celtic tribes built forts surrounded by moats but they were pastoral people, living in small villages, and did not build cities. They left standing stones and dolmens.

The Romans first came to Spain in 218 BC, and over the next three centuries there were various conflicts as the Romans advanced into Celtic lands. The Romans built roads across the territory and in 1978 the Roman town of Requejo in Santa Cristina de la Polvorosa was revealed after erosion occurred following flooding of the area by the River Órbigo. In 197 BC, Spain was divided into two provinces, Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior, controlled by two separate Roman military forces. Zamora was in the latter region. Peace reigned until 155 BC when the Lusitanians attacked Hispania Ulterior. Two Roman defeats followed, and many other rebellions were sparked in the peninsula. The Romans eventually prevailed, and in 27 BC, subdivided the province of Hispania Ulterior into Hispania Baetica (modern-day Andalusia) and Lusitania, which included Zamora. When the Vandals invaded the province in the 5th century AD, the Roman Emperor Honorius sent his brother-in-law, the Visigoths&#x27; king, to defeat the Vandals. The Visigoths seized control of most of Hispania and made Toledo the capital, while the Suevi occupied the northwestern part of the Peninsula and made their capital city Bracara. By 585 the Suevi had been conquered by the Visigoths who then controlled the whole peninsula.

==Tourism==
Zamora has many fine historic churches and buildings. These include a twelfth century Romanesque cathedral, many other churches, city walls, ancient houses and a castle. Pottery, textiles and wine are manufactured here.

 further north lies Benavente. It is famous for its Santa María church and the Castle of La Mota (now the Parador of Benavente). The Parador was the home of Ferdinand II of León who died here while returning from a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. The Parador occupies the Caracol Tower, a sixteenth-century castle, part of the former walled enclosure of the town.

The ancient town of Toro lies beside the Duero to the east of Zamora. Ferdinand III of Castile was crowned King of León in the town in 1230 and his wife Elisabeth of Swabia (Beatriz) died here. Notable features include the façade of the &#x27;Palacio de las Leyes&#x27; and also the Santa María la Mayor collegiate church (known in Spanish as &quot;La Colegiata&quot;). Legend has it that the wines of Toro were the first to reach America, being taken there by Christopher Columbus.

The region of Sanabria (or Senabria) is in the northwest of the province near the Sanabria Lake, one of the few large natural lakes in Spain, on the border with Galicia. It has been declared a Historic and Artistic centre. The lake is now part of Sanabria Lake Natural Park, having been declared a Natural Park in 1978.

Fermoselle is a medieval village located on the border with Portugal and on the edge of the Arribes del Duero Natural Park. Arribes is the name for the gorges through which the Duero and other rivers in this region flow. The steep slopes have long been terraced for the production of grapes, olives and other fruit.

Near the municipality of Villafáfila are lagoons that now form part of a nature reserve. They were formed by the historic mining of salt which started in the copper age and Bronze Age. Pottery items found here are similar to artefacts found in Mesopotamia, Turkey, Bosnia, Romania and Poland. The lagoons are home to numerous species of birds, and this is the second largest wetland reserve in Spain after Doñana National Park.

<text>The Orontes (; from Ancient Greek , ) or Nahr al-ʿĀṣī, or simply Asi (, ; ) is a long river in Western Asia that begins in Lebanon, flowing northwards through Syria before entering the Mediterranean Sea near Samandağ in Hatay Province, Turkey.

As the chief river of the northern Levant, the Orontes has been the site of many major battles including the Battle of Kadesh (13th century BCE), and water distribution remains a controversial issue between the countries in the region. Among the most important cities on the river are Homs, Hama, Jisr al-Shughur, and Antakya (the ancient Antioch, which was also known as &quot;Antioch on the Orontes&quot;).

==Names==
In the 9th century BCE, the ancient Assyrians referred to the river as Arantu, and the nearby Egyptians called it Araunti. The etymology of the name is unknown, yet some sources indicate that it might be derived from &quot;Arnt&quot; which means &quot;lioness&quot; in Syriac languages; others called it &quot;Alimas&quot;, a &quot;water goddess&quot; in Aramaic. &quot;Arantu&quot; gradually became &quot;Orontes&quot; in Greek.

In the Greek epic poem &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; (circa 400 CE), the river is said to have been named after Orontes, an Indian military leader who killed himself and fell into the river after losing to Dionysus in single combat. According to the Greek geographer Strabo (in &quot;Geographica&quot;, circa 20 CE), the river was originally named Typhon, because it was said that Zeus had struck the dragon Typhon down from the sky with thunder, and the river had formed where Typhon&#x27;s body had fallen; however, the river was later renamed Orontes when a man named Orontes built a bridge on it.

Macedonian settlers in Apamea named it the Axius, after a Macedonian river god. The Arabic name () is derived from the ancient &quot;Axius&quot;. The word coincidentally means &quot;insubordinate&quot; in Arabic, which folk etymology ascribes to the fact that the river flows from the south to the north unlike the rest of the rivers in the region.

The part of the river flowing from Lake Homs to Homs is known as al-Mimas, after the sanctuary of Deir Mimas situated there in honor of Saint Mamas.

==Course==
The Orontes rises in the springs near Labweh in Lebanon on the east side of the Beqaa Valley (in the Beqaa Governorate) between Mount Lebanon on the west and the Anti-Lebanon Mountains on the east, very near the source of the southward-flowing Litani, and runs north, falling through a gorge to leave the valley. The Ain ez Zarqa is one such major spring. Other major springs are Al Ghab, Al Rouj, and Al-Azraq. The river&#x27;s drainage basin within Lebanon is ; the country&#x27;s second largest behind Litani.

Leaving this gorge, it expands into the Lake of Homs (an artificial lake created by a Roman-era dam, also known as Qattinah lake) in the Homs Governorate of Syria and through the city of Homs (or Ḥimṣ). Next it flows through the Hama Governorate and its capital of Hamah (Hamaih-Epiphaneia), and the ancient site of Larissa (Shaizar). This is where the river enters the Ghab plain.
Further downstream, on the eastern edge of the Ghab, is located the ancient city of Apamea. To the west is the Coastal Mountain Range. The last Syrian governorate it goes through is Idlib and the city of Jisr al-Shughur. This section ends at the rocky barrier of Jisr al-Hadid, where the river turns west into the plain of Antioch (Amik Valley) in the Hatay Province of Turkey.
Two major tributaries, the southward-flowing Afrin River on the west and the Karasu on the east, join the Orontes through the former Lake Amik via an artificial channel (Nahr al-Kowsit). Passing north of Antakya (ancient Antioch), the Orontes dives southwest into a gorge (compared by the ancients to Tempe), and falls in to the sea just south of Samandağ (former Suedia, in antiquity Seleucia Pieria), after a total course of .


==History==
The Orontes is not easily navigable and the valley derives its historical importance as a road for north–south traffic; from Antioch south to Homs and thence to Damascus via al-Nabek. The Orontes has long been a boundary marker. For the Ancient Egyptians it marked the northern extremity of &quot;Amurru&quot;, east of Phoenicia. On the Orontes was fought the major Battle of Kadesh (circa 1274 BCE) between the Egyptian army of Ramesses II from the south and the Hittite army of Muwatalli II from the north. The river was also the site of the Battle of Qarqar fought in 853 BCE, when the army of Assyria, led by king Shalmaneser III, encountered an allied army of 12 kings led by Hadadezer of Damascus.

 Alexander the Great acquired the river valley after the defeat of the Persians in 333 BCE at the Battle of Issus (fought on the Pinarus river near modern İskenderun and north of modern Antakya). After his death in 323 BCE, it became part of the Seleucid Empire.
Seleucid cities founded on the Orontes included Seleucia ad Belum, Antigonia, and Antioch. Several Hellenistic artefacts feature the Tyche of Antioch with a male swimmer personifying the Orontes at her feet.

In 64 BCE Pompey took the Orontes river valley and made it part of the new Roman province of Syria with Antioch as its capital. Lake Homs Dam was built by the Roman emperor Diocletian in 290 CE. In addition to Lake Homs, further Roman dams and dykes would be built along the Orontes river around Apamea, to better irrigate the Ghab plain. In 198 CE the province was split with the lower Orontes in the new province of Coele Syria and the upper Orontes from Emesa (modern day Homs) south in Syria Phoenice. Emesa was later raised to co-capital of the latter.

In 637 CE the Battle of the Iron Bridge near Antioch was fought between the forces of the Rashidun Caliphate and the Byzantine Empire near the &quot;Iron bridge&quot; and won by the former which shortly took control of the whole of the river valley.

For the Crusaders in the 12th century, the Orontes River became the permanent boundary between the Principality of Antioch and that of Aleppo.

A diversion dam in Lebanon was 60% complete when Israeli airstrikes damaged it during the 2006 Israel–Hezbollah War.

The construction of a Syria–Turkey Friendship Dam was started in 2011 but postponed because of the Syrian Civil War. The war has also seen the siege of Homs from May 2011 until May 2014. 

==In art==
The French writer Maurice Barrès purportedly transcribed in &quot;Un jardin sur l&#x27;Oronte&quot; (1922) a story that an Irish archaeologist had translated for him from a manuscript one evening in June 1914 at a &quot;café&quot; in Hama by the Orontes.

<text>Budgie is the debut album by the Welsh heavy metal band Budgie. It was released on 30 July 1971, through MCA Records. The US version on Kapp Records includes &quot;Crash Course in Brain Surgery&quot;, originally released as a single and covered by Metallica on their 1987 EP &quot;The $5.98 E.P. - Garage Days Re-Revisited&quot;. &quot;Homicidal Suicidal&quot; has also been covered by the Seattle grunge band Soundgarden. Canadian band Thrush Hermit covered &quot;Nude Disintegrating Parachutist Woman&quot; on the album &quot;All Technology Aside&quot;, included on the 2010 &quot;The Complete Recordings&quot; box set.

==Reception==
&quot;Sounds&quot; criticized the album as being somewhat nondescript, but praised it for having &quot;a lot of good natured foot-tapping music&quot; and concluded &quot;I certainly find it infinitely preferable to Black Sabbath, and I have the feeling that Budgie might develop into something a lot more interesting.&quot;

In a brief retrospective review, AllMusic declared that &quot;For those seriously interested in metal&#x27;s development, bombastic treasures like &#x27;Homicidal Suicidal,&#x27; and &#x27;Nude Disintegrating Parachutist Woman&#x27; are essential listening.&quot;

<text>León (, ; ; ; ) is a province of northwestern Spain in the northern part of the Region of León and in the northwestern part of the autonomous community of Castile and León.

About one quarter of its population of 463,746 (2018) lives in the capital, León. The climate is dry, cold in winter and hot in summer. This creates the perfect environment for wine and all types of cold meats and sausages like the leonese &quot;Morcilla&quot; and the &quot;Cecina&quot;.

There are two famous Roman Catholic cathedrals in the province, the main one in León and another in Astorga. The province shares the Picos de Europa National Park (in the Picos de Europa mountain range) with Cantabria and Asturias. It has 211 municipalities.

==History==
The province of León was established in 1833 with the new Spanish administrative organisation of regions and provinces to replace former kingdoms. The greater Leonese Region was composed of the provinces of León, Salamanca and Zamora.

The Kingdom of León was founded in 910 A.D. when the Christian princes of Asturias along the northern coast of the Iberian peninsula shifted their main seat from Oviedo to the city of León. The eastern, inland part of the kingdom was joined dynastically to the Kingdom of Castile, first in 1037–1065, then in 1077–1109 and again in 1126–1157, 1230–1296 and from 1301 onward (see: historic union of the Kingdoms of Castile and León). The western and Atlantic provinces became the Kingdom of Portugal in 1139.

The independently administered Kingdom of León, situated in the northwestern region of the Iberian Peninsula, retained the status of a kingdom until 1833, although dynastic union had brought it into the Crown of Castile. The Kingdom was composed of &quot;Adelantamientos Mayores&quot;, where the Leonese &quot;Adelantamientos&quot; consisted of the territories between the &quot;Picos de Europa&quot; and the Duero River. The political and military chiefs of these territories were referred to as &quot;Adelantados&quot;; those chiefs began to convene as an assembly in the early 12th century, while the crown appointed the &quot;Merinos&quot; as minor and appellate judges.

According to UNESCO, in 1188 the Kingdom of León developed the first Parliament in Europe, the &quot;Cortes de León&quot;, which included the elected representatives of towns and cities. In 1202, that Parliament approved economic legislation to regulate trade and guilds.

==Population==
The historical population is given in the following chart:
==Languages==
The Provincial Government of León signed accords with language associations for promoting the Leonese language. Leonese is taught in the city of León, Mansilla de las Mulas, La Bañeza, Valencia de Don Juan or Ponferrada for adult people, and in sixteen schools of León. The City Council of León writes some of its announcements in Leonese in order to promote the language.

In the western part of the El Bierzo, the westernmost region of the province, Galician language is spoken and taught at schools.

==Climate==

As for the temperatures, in general it is a cold climate due to the altitude and the abundance of frost (which persist from November to May), being more intense in the mountainous areas reaching -18 °C. Vega de Liordes, an enclave in the León sector of Picos de Europa belonging to the municipality of Posada de Valdeón registered on January 7, 2021.

==Cuisine==
Embutidos
* &quot;Cecina de León&quot;: from beef. In the Leonese language, &quot;cecina&quot; means &quot;meat that has been salted and dried by means of air, sun or smoke&quot;. &quot;Cecina de León&quot; is made of the hind legs of beef, salted, smoked and air-dried in the province of León, and has PGI status.
* &quot;Botillo&quot;: from pig. Traditionally made in the western Leonese regions, &quot;botiellu&quot; in Leonese or &quot;botelo&quot; in Galician, is a dish of meat-stuffed pork intestine. It is a culinary specialty of the county of El Bierzo and also of the region of Trás-os-Montes in Portugal. This type of &quot;embutido&quot; is a meat product made from different pieces left over from the butchering of a pig, including the ribs, tail, and bones with a little meat left on them. These are chopped; seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic, and other spices; stuffed in the cecum of the pig; and partly cured via smoking. It can also include the pig&#x27;s tongue, shoulder blade, jaw, and backbone, but never exceeding 20% of the total volume. It is normally consumed cooked, covered with a sheet. In some parts of the province, specially close to Orbigo river it&#x27;s also known as Yosco. It has PGI status.

<doc id="143623" wikidata="Q1194339" url="?curid=143623" title="Rosemary's Baby (novel)">
<text>Rosemary&#x27;s Baby is a 1967 horror novel by American writer Ira Levin; it was his second published book. It was the best-selling horror novel of the 1960s, selling over four million copies. The high popularity of the novel was a catalyst for a &quot;horror boom&quot;, and horror fiction would achieve enormous commercial success in its wake.

==Plot==
The book centers on Rosemary Woodhouse, a young woman who moves into the Bramford, a historic Gothic Revival-style New York City apartment building, with her husband, Guy, a struggling actor. Guy has so far appeared only in small roles in the stage plays &quot;Luther,&quot; &quot;Nobody Loves an Albatross,&quot; and various TV commercials. A friend warns the pair that the Bramford has a disturbing history involving witchcraft and murder, but they discount this. Rosemary wants to start a family, but Guy prefers waiting until his career is more established.

Neighbors Minnie and Roman Castevet, an eccentric, elderly couple, welcome Rosemary and Guy to the Bramford. Rosemary finds them meddlesome and annoying, but Guy begins frequently visiting them.

After the lead actor in a new stage play suddenly goes blind, Guy is cast in the role. Immediately afterward, Guy unexpectedly agrees with Rosemary that they should have their first child. That night, Rosemary dreams of a rough sexual encounter with a huge, inhuman creature with yellow eyes. The next morning Rosemary finds claw marks on her breasts and groin, which Guy dismisses as resulting from his hangnail, which he has cut. Rosemary subsequently learns that she is pregnant.

Rosemary falls severely ill; but her intense pain and weight loss are ignored by others and attributed to hysteria. Her doctor and Minnie feed her strange and foul concoctions. Rosemary also develops a peculiar craving for raw meat.

Guy&#x27;s performance in the play garners favorable notices, and other increasingly significant roles follow. Guy soon begins talking about a career in Hollywood.

Rosemary&#x27;s friend, Edward &quot;Hutch&quot; Hutchins, also becomes mysteriously ill. He had sent Rosemary a warning, leading to her discovery that Roman Castevet is the leader of a Satanic coven. She suspects her unborn baby is wanted as a sacrifice to the devil. Despite her growing conviction, she is unable to convince anyone, particularly Guy. Ultimately, Rosemary discovers the coven&#x27;s real intent for wanting her baby, whom she wanted to name Andrew (&quot;Andy&quot;) but whom the coven insists will be renamed Adrian. He is the Antichrist, and Satan sired him, not Guy.

==Critical reception==
Cherry Wilder wrote that &quot;&quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; is one of the most perfectly crafted thrillers ever written&quot;. 

Horror scholar Gary Crawford described &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; as &quot;a genuine masterpiece&quot;. 

David Pringle described &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; as &quot;this sly, seductive impeccably-written horror novel ... is an expertly constructed story, a playwright&#x27;s book, in which every physical detail and line of dialogue counts.&quot;

==Sequel==
Thirty years later Levin published a sequel to the novel, titled &quot;Son of Rosemary&quot; (1997). Levin dedicated it to Mia Farrow.

==Censorship==
&quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; was published in Spanish translation during the Francoist dictatorship. The Francoist censors cut passages from this translation, claiming the cut passages &quot;glorified Satan&quot;. As of April 2019, all the Spanish-language editions of the book still retain these cuts.

==Adaptations==
In 1968, the novel was adapted as a film of the same name, starring Mia Farrow, with John Cassavetes as Guy. Ruth Gordon, who played Minnie Castevet, won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Roman Polanski, who wrote and directed the film, was nominated for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. The exterior shots of the fictional Bramford apartment were filmed at the Dakota on Central Park West in New York. 

A television film sequel to the Polanski film, &quot;Look What&#x27;s Happened to Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;, was produced in 1976.

In 2014, the novel was adapted as an NBC television miniseries, with Zoe Saldaña as Rosemary. The two-part miniseries aired on Mother&#x27;s Day of that year. Neither the TV sequel nor the TV miniseries garnered critical acclaim.

Paramount produced a prequel titled &quot;Apartment 7A&quot;, starring Julia Garner and Dianne Wiest.

<text>If I Were Brittania I&#x27;d Waive the Rules is the sixth album by the Welsh power trio heavy metal blues rock band Budgie, released in April 1976.

The album is the band&#x27;s first new release with A&amp;M Records, having signed with them in late 1975 to distribute the US pressings of &quot;Bandolier&quot;. Musically, the album is significantly more subdued and polished than their earlier, heavier releases, exploring new experimental territory, which they would also continue to develop on their next release, &#x27;Impeckable&#x27; : the band&#x27;s usual hard rock blues rock style is augmented on this album with funk-Jazz rock fusion elements in two songs, and progressive rock in two others.The sound engineer on the album was Pat Moran, noted for his equally eclectic rock-fusion work with Dr. Feelgood (band) on Down by the Jetty, Robert Plant, Lou Gramm, Queen, Iggy Pop, Van der Graaf Generator, and Peter Hammill. The album was recorded at Rockfield Studios.

Noted science fiction fantasy artist and book-cover illustrator Alun Hood provided the iconic artwork for the sleeve, whilst acclaimed rock photographer, Gered Mankowitz provided the band photographs. The title of the album is a pun on the concept of Britannia ruling the waves. Professor Irene Morra of Cardiff University wrote that Budgie used this title to &quot;declare an essential lack of agency within Britain&quot; which helped portray a countercultural identity, lacking in national ambition.

<text>Palencia is a province of northern Spain, in the northern part of the autonomous community of Castile and León in the north of the Iberian Peninsula. It is bordered by the provinces of León, Cantabria, Burgos, and Valladolid.

== Overview ==

Of the population of 176,125 (2002), 45% live in the capital, Palencia which is located on the Canal de Castilla. There are 191 municipalities in the province, of which more than half are villages with fewer than 200 people. The majority of the province is very sparsely-populated and has lost a significant proportion of its population since Francoist times due to rural to urban migration.

The major towns in the northern Montaña Palentina are: Guardo, a former coal mining town; Aguilar de Campoo, a historic town famous for its biscuit production and Cervera de Pisuerga, a tourist town situated at the beginning of the Ruta de los Pantanos (the Reservoirs Route) and Barruelo de Santullán, which, as the centre of the province&#x27;s coal mining industry, was the largest town in the province until the 1960s. Towns in the centre of the province include: Saldaña, known for the famous mosaics at the nearby Roman villa of La Olmeda, Herrera de Pisuerga, a village known for its summer activities and Crab Festival and Carrión de los Condes, a key monastery town on the Camino de Santiago. To the south of the city of Palencia are Venta de Baños, an important railway and industrial exchange, as well as Villamuriel de Cerrato, a village to that owes its development to the Renault factory and its proximity to the capital.

During the Middle Ages, the Visigoths ruled Palencia. Basílica de San Juan, the oldest Visigothic church in Spain, was built in 661 in the province&#x27;s Baños de Cerrato. During the thirteenth century a university was founded in the province. It was the first university in Spain and one of the first in the world. It was later shifted to Valladolid.

The province is bordered on the north by Cantabria, on the west by the province of León, on the east by the province of Burgos and on the south by the province of Valladolid. Two exclaves of the province, Cezura, and Lastrilla, are enclaves within Campoo, Cantabria, with the former being under 200 metres and the latter being just over 200 metres from the border at their closest point.

In Palencia large protected areas such as the Natural Park of Fuentes Carrionas and Fuente Cobre-Montaña Palencia are located. The term historical region in Palencia, refers to those regions created in the fourteenth century, under the name merindades. Cantabrian Mountains are located in the northerns parts of the province. The high Curavacas peak is located in the province. The major commercial products produced in the province are barley, wheat, sugar beets, hemp, linen and woolen clothes, porcelain, leather, paper, and rugs. Food processing and metallurgy are major industries. The province has three judicial districts–one each in Palencia, Carrión de los Condes and Cervera de Pisuerga.

<text>The province of Burgos is a province of northern Spain, in the northeastern part of the autonomous community of Castile and León. It is bordered by the provinces of Palencia, Cantabria, Vizcaya, Álava, La Rioja, Soria, Segovia, and Valladolid. Burgos is the province of Spain that has borders with most provinces. Its capital is the city of Burgos.

The Cartularies of Valpuesta from the monastery Santa María de Valpuesta, in Burgos, are considered to be the oldest known documents containing words written in the Spanish language.

==Overview==
Since 1964, archaeologists have been working at numerous areas of the Archaeological Site of Atapuerca, where they have found ancient hominid and human remains, the former dating to more than one million years ago, with artefacts from the Palaeolithic and Bronze Ages of man. The site has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The province has an area of and a population of approximately 375,000 of whom nearly half live in the capital. The other locations higher than 20,000 inhabitants apart from Burgos are Miranda de Ebro and Aranda de Duero, both very industrialized. The Sierra de la Demanda, the northwesternmost end of the Sistema Ibérico, is located in Burgos Province.

The most important rivers in the province are the Ebro and the Duero. The river Duero is in the south of the province and leads to the Atlantic Ocean at Porto, Portugal. Planted near it is a notable vineyard, Ribera de Duero. The north and south-east of the province are mountainous. The Ebro flows to the Mediterranean Sea.

In Valpuesta the oldest texts in the Spanish language has been found, dating from the tenth century.

Transportation is developed through a wide net of highways and roads. Besides, the province is served by the Burgos Airport, and was to have received High-speed rail AVE around 2016.

==History==

In the Atapuerca area, archaeologists have found evidence of occupation by hominids and humans for more than one million years. Discoveries have included the earliest hominid skull in Europe.

The Celtiberian region that became Burgos was inhabited by the Morgobos, Turmodigi, Berones and perhaps also the Pellendones, the last inhabitants of the northern part of the Celtiberian region. According to the Greek historian Ptolemy, the principal cities included: Brabum, Sisara, Deobrigula (nowadays Tardajos), Ambisna Segiasamon (Sasamón) and Verovesca (Briviesca). Under Roman colonization, it was part of Hispania Citerior (&quot;Hither Spain&quot;) and then Hispania Tarraconensis.

In the fifth century, the Visigoths drove back the Suevi. In the eighth century, the Arabs occupied all of Castiles. Alfonso III the Great, king of León reconquered the area around the middle of the ninth century, and built many castles for the defence of Christendom. Gradually the area was reconquered. The region came to be known as Castile (Latin &quot;castella&quot;), i.e. &quot;land of castles&quot;. In the eleventh century, Burgos became the capital of the Kingdom of Castile.

===Population development===
The historical population is given in the following chart:
== Comarcas ==

<text>Ardleigh Green is an area in east London, England, within the London Borough of Havering. It is east-northeast of Charing Cross. This part of London is predominantly residential.

==History==

===Toponymy===
The place is an enlargement of a hamlet of (within the parish of) Hornchurch, known only as Hardley Green in various orthographies (written forms) until at least the early 17th century. With various hamlets, Hornchurch, Havering(-atte-Bower) and Romford formed not a Hundred (division of a county for minor purposes) but a liberty, the Liberty of Havering. For many centuries the three old churches of these places remained of chapel and chapelry administrative status only, as the liberty matched the area of the ancient parish of Hornchurch, which provided a substantial living (benefice, of capital and income for the parish priest) in the church.

The first written name &quot;Haddeleye&quot; and all later forms evidence a clear corruption or natural progression of an older form, meaning &quot;heath clearing&quot; or perhaps more specifically &quot;clearing [in the] heather&quot; from the Old English &quot;hæth&quot; and &quot;lēah&quot;. It was last referred to as &quot;Hardley Green&quot; in 1883, so appearing in that year&#x27;s Ordnance Survey map.

==Geography==
Ardleigh Green has a small set of shops. The area naturally drains to form the headwaters of a stream, The Ravensbourne which briefly flows, before joining the River Rom.

==Transport==
The nearest railway stations are , and . There are London Bus services to Hornchurch, Gidea Park and Romford.

<text>Soria is a province of central Spain, in the eastern part of the autonomous community of Castile and León. Most of the province is in the mountainous Sistema Ibérico area.

== Demographics ==

It is bordered by the provinces of La Rioja, Zaragoza, Guadalajara, Segovia, and Burgos. Soria is the least populous of all of Spain&#x27;s provinces, with a density of around 9 inhabitants/km2—one of the lowest in the European Union. The average population density of provinces in Spain and European Union are 83.6 and 116 inhabitants per square km respectively. In comparison, the Soria province is less dense than some northern parts of the Nordic countries.
Of the province&#x27;s population of 91,487 (2002), nearly 40% live in the capital, Soria. 26.7% of its population was above 65 years of age while the nation&#x27;s average is 16.9%. There are 183 municipalities in Soria, of which nearly half are hamlets of under 100 people and of which only 12 have more than 1,000 people. The cathedral town of the province is El Burgo de Osma.

===Population development===
The historical population is given in the following chart:
==Economy==
The province&#x27;s most important agricultural products are cereals. In the 1950s, there were a total of 70,000 hectares cultivated land, but excessive fragmentation and lack of mechanization resulted in a very low productivity. In 1960, while the agricultural sector accounted for 69% of workers in the province, 70% of farms were used exclusively for animal rearing. There are currently about 100,000 hectares of land in the province dedicated to the cultivation of wheat and other 100,000 hectares for barley cultivation.

The indigenous forest resources are also being exploited for timber, resin and collecting mushrooms. Marble quarries are located in Espejón while Sierra de Toranzo and Ólvega have iron mines. Magnetite sources are also being exploited in Borobia. The capital city Soria is an important tourist destination. While the agricultural sector has a very high contribution to GDP of the province, the industrial sector represents a small proportion, just over 20% of GDP. Apart from these the province also has important food, wood processing, furniture production and auxiliary automotive components industries.

== Subdivision ==
=== Comarcas ===
Soria has 183 municipalities divided in 10 comarcas:

* Comarca de Almazán
* Comarca de Berlanga
* Comarca de Burgo de Osma
* Comarca de Campo de Gómara
* Comarca de El Valle
* Comarca de Pinares
* Comarca de Soria
* Comarca de Tierras Altas
* Comarca del Moncayo
* Tierra de Medinaceli

==Coat of arms==
The province&#x27;s coat of arms bears the motto &quot;Soria pura, cabeza de estremadura&quot;, which means &quot;Soria the pure, head of the borderland&quot;, as Soria was centuries ago on the expanding borders between the northern Christian kingdoms and the territories then held by the Muslims.

<doc id="143648" wikidata="Q1902832" url="?curid=143648" title="Emerson Park">
<text>Emerson Park is a suburban neighbourhood in the London Borough of Havering, east London. The neighbourhood developed as two large housing estates built on the estate of Nelmes manor in the parish of Hornchurch. Emerson Park estate to the south started construction in 1895 and Great Nelmes estate to the north was begun in 1901. It is located north of the Romford–Upminster line and a station opened at Emerson Park in 1909. The mansion of Nelmes survived until it was demolished in 1967 to avoid preservation by the Civic Amenities Act and was replaced with a small housing estate called The Witherings. Emerson Park is located northeast of Charing Cross in Central London.
==History==
===Toponymy===
Emerson Park is named after Emerson, the eldest son of William Carter of Parkstone, Dorset who bought land in the area for property development in 1895. Prior to suburban housebuilding, it was the manor of Nelmes which was recorded as &quot;Elmes&quot; in 1333.

===Economic development===
The railway came to the parish of Hornchurch with the Great Eastern Railway opening a station at Harold Wood in 1868 and the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway at Hornchurch in 1885. Both were some distance from the village of Hornchurch. The London, Tilbury and Southend built a branch line from Upminster to Romford in 1893 which skirted the southern boundary of Nelmes manor. A station, initially called Emerson Park and Great Nelmes Halt, was opened on 1 October 1909. The London, Tilbury and Southend became part of the Midland Railway in 1912. 

In 1899 the Emerson Park Stores opened and the Chequers Inn was rebuilt. The Emerson Park Stores was converted to a club for the Hornchurch Liberal association, with an official opening on 16 June 1910.

===Residential estates===
In 1894 the Nelmes estate, in the parish of Hornchurch, is listed as comprising two houses, three farms, market gardens and other land, totalling .

In 1895 the southern part of Nelmes manor, comprising , was sold by Benjamin H Newman to William Carter. In the next ten years 200 homes of the Emerson Park Estate were constructed by Homesteads Limited. The houses were large, detached and typically situated on plots of an acre. There was some variety in the houses and the original sales prices ranged from £300 to £1,000.

In 1901 the northern portion of Nelmes manor, comprising , was sold for the Great Nelmes Estate. Louis Sinclair, the local MP, was listed as tenant of the mansion.

The estates were subject to restrictive covenants which prevented an increased density of housing. In 1930 a development of 76 homes on the Wych Elm Farm was proposed which would have a density of nine semi-detached homes per acre and would be sold at £1,000 per pair. This was opposed by residents of the Emerson Park and Great Nelmes estates. The arbitration of the case resulted in detached properties of six per acre sold at £650 facing the Emerson Park estate to the west and semi-detached properties at the higher density to the east.

===Nelmes manor house===
Nelmes manor house was built by in 1540 by William Roche, who was Lord Mayor of London. Roche had purchased two manors in Havering that had been held separately, Gobions in Romford and Nelmes in Hornchurch. Nelmes was held by the Roche family and then sold to the politician Robert Naunton in the 1620s. The manor was held by the Naunton family and then sold to the postal administrator Thomas Witherings around 1646.

The Nelmes mansion and about three acres of grounds, sandwiched between the two housing estates, were sold in 1903 to Alfred Barber. He sold it in 1925 to John H. Platford and it was inherited by Roy Platford in 1966. The house was demolished by Platford in 1967 to avoid a preservation order by the Greater London Council as part of the incoming Civic Amenities Act 1967. The land was used for The Witherings neo-Georgian style housing development. Part of the moat appears to have been retained. Capel Nelmes, a 16th century outbuilding, survived and was grade II listed in 1972. The 17th century conduit house which provided water to Nelmes also survives and was grade II listed in 1974.

==Governance==
Emerson Park is a ward for elections to Havering London Borough Council. The wards were redrawn for the 2022 election and since then two councillors are elected.

Emerson Park is part of the Hornchurch and Upminster Parliamentary constituency and the Havering and Redbridge London Assembly constituency.

==Geography==
Emerson Park is located approximately northeast of Hornchurch town centre and northeast of Charing Cross in Central London. It is part of the RM11 postcode district in the Hornchurch post town. The Emerson Park electoral ward revision in 2022 more closely approximates the neighbourhood, by removing land north of the A127 Southend Arterial Road and west of The Ravensbourne.

==Transport==
Emerson Park railway station is on Romford–Upminster line with a half-hourly London Overground service. The short branch line provides links to for connection to the Elizabeth line and Great Eastern Main Line and to for connection to the District line of the London Underground and the London, Tilbury and Southend line. Emerson Park is served by London Buses routes 193, 256 and 370.

<doc id="143650" wikidata="Q55283" url="?curid=143650" title="Province of Segovia">
<text>Segovia () is a province of central/northern Spain, in the southern part of the autonomous community of Castile and León. It is bordered by the province of Burgos in the north, Soria in the northeast, Guadalajara in the east, Madrid in the south, Ávila in the west and southwest, and Valladolid in the northwest. The average temperature ranges from 10 °C to 20 °C.

== Overview ==

The province has a population of 149,286, of whom about 35% live in the capital, Segovia. Of the 209 municipalities in the province, more than half are villages with under 200 people.
As of 2024, there are five municipalities with more than 5,000 inhabitants:
* Real Sitio de San Ildefonso with 5,205.
* Palazuelos de Eresma with 5,968.
* Cuéllar with 9,530.
* El Espinar with 10,145.
* Segovia with 51,525.
The name &quot;Segovia&quot; is said to be of Celtiberian origin, but also thought to be derived from the conquest and occupation of Castile by the Visigoths, a Scandinavian / Germanic tribe living in Castile from the 4th to 6th centuries AD. The provincial corporation consists of 25 elected members. After the recent elections there are 10 members of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party and 15 of the People&#x27;s Party. The historical heritage of this province is rich and varied. The capital city has the 800-metre-long Roman Aqueduct of Segovia, which is unique to the province. The capital was declared a world heritage site in 1985. Sepúlveda, Ayllón, Pedraza, Coca and La Granja de San Ildefonso villages attract a large number of tourists. La Granja de San Ildefonso houses a national monument–The Royal Palace. Antonio Machado&#x27;s house is located in Ayllón. Tourism is one of the most important industries. In July 2014, the provincial government signed an agreement with Bankia which will contribute 10,000 euros to promote the province&#x27;s tourism industry. Agriculture also contributes significantly to the province&#x27;s Gross Domestic Product. Wheat, barley, rye and rice have been the most important cereals. During the seventeenth century many of the province&#x27;s towns recorded decline in cereal production. Cattle rearing is also an important commercial activity.

<text>The province of Badajoz ( ; ) is a province of western Spain located in the autonomous community of Extremadura. It was formed in 1833. It is bordered by the provinces of Cáceres in the north, Toledo, Ciudad Real in the east, Córdoba in the south-east, Seville, and Huelva in the south and Portugal in the west.

With an area of , it is the largest province in Spain. The other province of Extremadura, Cáceres, is the second largest with 19,868 km2 in area. The province has a relatively lower population density in comparison to other provinces in Spain.

, the province has a population of 669,943 inhabitants. Its capital is the city of Badajoz.

== History ==
The province enjoyed great prominence during the Roman Empire when Mérida was made one of the capital cities. When the Visigoth period ended and the Moors had invaded Spain, the Ibn-al-Aftas dynasty established a great cultural and scientific centre in the province. Many of the explorers who set out to conquer the New World were from this province.

==Geography==
===Topography===
Although many districts have low ranges of hills, the surface is more often a desolate and monotonous plain, flat or slightly undulating. Its one large river is the Guadiana, which traverses the north of the province from east to west, fed by many tributaries; but it is only at certain seasons that the river-beds fill with any considerable volume of water, and the Guadiana may frequently be forded without difficulty. The climate is continental with great extremes of heat in summer and of cold in winter, when fierce north and north-west winds blow across the plains. Mountains, pastures and Mediterranean forests are important geographical features of this province.

===Administrative divisions===
The Province of Badajoz is divided into 165 municipalities. After Badajoz, the capital, the main towns in the province are Almendralejo, Azuaga, Don Benito, Olivenza, Jerez de los Caballeros, Mérida, Zafra, Montijo and Villanueva de la Serena. There are also traditional comarcas (shires, but with no administrative role) in the province, including La Siberia and Llanos de Olivenza. The capital city of Badajoz is the most important commercial center of the province. The Council of Badajoz has its seat in this city.

== Demographics ==
The province of Badajoz has 673,559 inhabitants (INE 2019), with a population density in 2018 of 31.07 inhabitants/km2, below the national average (91.13 inhabitants/km2).

It is the twenty-third most populated province in the country, just behind Toledo. It exceeds in almost 280,000 inhabitants to Cáceres (396,487), the other Extremaduran province.

22.26% of its inhabitants live in the city of Badajoz, which, with a population of 150,702 (INE 2019), stands out as the most populated urban centre in the province. The next city by population is Mérida, which with 59,335 inhabitants (INE 2019), is home to 8.81% of the province&#x27;s total population.

=== Evolution of the population of the province of Badajoz since 1842 ===
The population in the province of Badajoz has been characterized by a constant growth until the 1960s, when a strong exodus towards more prosperous areas of the country began, mainly Catalonia and Madrid, reducing the population by almost 200,000 inhabitants in a matter of 20 years. Since the 1980s the population has stagnated below 700,000, with a slight growth until 2010, when the trend is again reversed and the province loses population again. If we observe the trend by municipalities, we can see how the municipalities located in the mountains to the east and south of the province are constantly losing population while those located near the population centres of Badajoz, Mérida, Don Benito or Almendralejo are growing.

The historical population is given in the following chart:
== Economy ==

The economic production differs according to the region and locality. Thus the big cities like Badajoz, Mérida, Don Benito, Almendralejo and others, offer and live from services and to a lesser extent from general industries of medium type. In the regions of Guadiana, Tierra de Mérida – Vegas Bajas, Vegas Altas and part of Tierra de Badajoz, and in Tierra de Barros besides the traditional source of agricultural wealth, there is a flourishing industry of agro-livestock transformation. In other regions more distant from urban centres and the main roads, such as Campiña Sur, La Serena and La Siberia, the main source is the primary sector, i.e. agriculture and perhaps even more livestock (sheep and pig).

The agricultural sector is dominated by irrigated areas in the Guadiana Valley (Badajoz, Montijo, Mérida, Don Benito-Villanueva), the predominant olive groves in Tierra de Barros, and the vineyards, extensive in Tierra de Barros and in Llerena (Campiña Sur).

The industrial sector, although less developed and very low in proportion to national activity, has a proportion of employed population similar to the agro-livestock sector: 12.13% (up to 26% if we include construction) compared to 14% (primary sector). The two main cities of the province stand out: Badajoz and Mérida, with their respective industrial parks; and the towns of Jerez de los Caballeros, Don Benito-Villanueva and Almendralejo.

The tertiary sector is the most predominant sector in the province (61.87% of the population employed), where the business (Almendralejo and Zafra), commercial (Badajoz) and tourism and administrative (Mérida) sectors stand out.

== Tourist destinations ==
The economy of the province is based on tourism and agriculture. Some of the popular tourist destinations of the province include Badajoz, Fregenal de la Sierra, Jerez de los Caballeros, Llerena, Mérida, Olivenza, Alange, Alburquerque and Almendralejo. The popular dishes include hare, partridge and various pork products. Cornalvo Nature Reserve, the ancient structure of Roman Theatre in Mérida, National Museum of Roman Art in Mérida, Alcazaba City Wall and Ibn Marwan Monument and Espantaperros Tower of Badajoz Fortress are popular tourist spots.

The National Museum of Roman Art was designed in 1980 by architect José Rafael Moneo Vallés and completed in 1985. The architect designed the museum to have a Roman feel and look. Romans used to control present-day Spain, also known as the Iberian Peninsula, in the years following their arrival around 295 BC. Today, Mérida has the greatest number of noteworthy Roman buildings still surviving. It is also famous on an archaeological basis. The museum exhibits remnants of Roman infrastructure and dwellings, including those showing Christian influences like a basilica, and tombs. Inspiration for the National Museum of Roman Art dates back to 1838, when the city located the museum in a church, Santa Clara.

<doc id="143655" wikidata="Q15678" url="?curid=143655" title="Cáceres, Spain">
<text>Cáceres ( , ) is a city and Spanish municipality located in the center of the autonomous community of Extremadura. It is the capital and most populated municipality of the province of Cáceres and houses the headquarters of the Superior Court of Justice of Extremadura.

The municipality has a land area of , the largest in Spain. According to official INE data for 2021, the municipality had a population of 95,418 inhabitants, of which 94,326 lived in the city itself. Numerous inhabited places are scattered throughout the municipality, including castles and farmhouses with several centuries of history. The medieval walled city was declared a World Heritage City by UNESCO in 1986.

Since 2008 the city has been organized into four districts: Center-Old Town, North, West and South; a fifth district, Pedanías, covers the non-urban part of the term. The actual municipal population data varies significantly, fluctuating by more than 30,000 people primarily related to educational centers such as the Cáceres Campus of the University of Extremadura or the CEFOT-1 of the Army. The city usually empties in summer, when many residents return to their towns of origin.
Cáceres lies at the feet of the Sierra de la Mosca, a modest hill range. It is part of the &quot;Vía de la Plata&quot; (&quot;Silver Route&quot;) path of the Camino de Santiago that crosses the west of the Iberian Peninsula in a north–south direction.

The Universidad de Extremadura, and two astronomical observatories are situated in Cáceres. Today, the headquarters of the university as well as several regional government departments are found in Cáceres. The city is also a seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Coria-Cáceres.

==Name==
No consensus has been reached among historians regarding the etymology of Cáceres, some considering its origin as Roman and others as Arabic. Among philologists the consensus is that it is Latin nomenclature deformed by Arabic, until finally adapting to the definitive Christian name, as happened with at least half of all place names of ancient origin in the southern Iberian Peninsula.

Regarding its possible Roman origin, two known Latin names could have evolved into the current &quot;Cáceres.&quot; One would come from the colony &quot;&quot;Norba Caesarina&quot; (founded in 34 BC), &quot;Norba&quot; in honor of the hometown of Gaius Norbanus Flaccus, the Roman general who founded the town, and &quot;Caesarina&quot; in memory of Julius Caesar. The other name is &quot;Castra Caecilia&quot;,&quot; given by the consul Quinto Cecilio Metelo Pío to one of the military camps near the colony. With any of these toponyms based on &quot;castra&quot; (&quot;camp&quot;), its ablative &quot;&quot;castris&quot;,&quot; which means &quot;in the camp&quot;, could have provided the original form of the current &quot;Cáceres.&quot;

Historians have debated which of these is the true origin; until the 19th century it was mistakenly thought that Norba Caesarina was the neighboring town of Alcántara, while it was believed that the walled enclosure of Cáceres was Castra Caecilia.

Due to the documentary obscurity of the Visigoth period, it is not clear by what name Caceres was known when the Muslims arrived here. Documents from the 3rd and 4th Centuries indicate that the name of the area had been shortened in the colloquial form &quot;&quot;Castris&quot;.&quot;

The Ravenna Cosmography fixes the use of &quot;Castris&quot; in the 4th century, however, the following mentions of the locality reappear in Muslim texts:
• The Baghdadi geographer Ibn Hawqal located a locality called &quot;&quot;ḥiṣn Qāṣras&quot; in this place. 
• A century and a half later, Al-Idrisi from Ceuta reiterates this name. 
• A third source from the end of the Muslim period, written in the late 12th century or early 13th century by Yaqut, suggests that it was renamed &quot;Qāṣr As&quot;.&quot;

In any case, sources from the time are scarce, since the Muslims never considered Cáceres as an important town beyond its use as a military fortification.

Both the transliteration of the Arabic toponym into the Latin alphabet and the creation of a name in the Romance languages were disparate. In some ancient writings and medieval documents various names appear, such as:
• &quot;&quot;Caceres&quot; in a bull of 1168 by Pope Alexander III, awarding the territory to the diocese of Coria in the first Leonese conquest;
• &quot;Castes&quot; in a Castilian document from 1171 by King Alfonso VIII, through which he recognized the Fratres of Cáceres as owners of the land;
• &quot;Carceres&quot; in the mandate of Alfonso IX of León dated in the year 1222 (however, the same king adopts the form &quot;Caceres&quot;&quot; in another document of the same year signed during the siege);
• «&quot;Canceres&quot;» written the document of 1229 through which Alfonso IX gave concessions to the Order of Santiago.

==History==
Visitors can see remains from Prehistoric, medieval times, the Roman occupation, Moorish occupation and the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain. Cáceres has four main areas to be explored: the historical quarter, the Jewish quarter, the modern center, and the outskirts.

===Prehistoric===
There have been settlements near Cáceres since prehistoric times. Evidence of this can be found in the caves of Maltravieso and El Conejar. The Maltravieso Cave (discovered in 1956 by the academic and official chronicler of Cáceres Carlos Callejo) contains hundreds of paintings, including the world&#x27;s oldest known cave painting, a red hand stencil older than 67,000 years. This is 20,000 years before the known arrival of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; to Europe and therefore is believed to have been made by Neanderthals. These paintings date to several of the Upper Paleolithic periods.

In the nearby El Conejar cave, ceramics and lithic utensils have been found that date the occupation of the cave to the Ancient Neolithic (VI-V millennium BC); the possibility that the cave was occupied during the Epipaleolithic period should not be ruled out. Location of trepanned skulls and decorated ceramics suggest that the Maltravieso cave was also occupied during the Bronze Age.

===Roman rule===
The city was founded by the Romans in 25 BCE. Cáceres as a city was founded as &quot;Castra Caecilia&quot; by Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius and started to gain importance as a strategic city under Roman occupation. Remains found in the city suggest that it was a thriving center as early as 25 BCE. Some remains of the first city walls built by the Romans in the 3rd and 4th centuries still exist, including one gateway, the &quot;Arco de Cristo&quot;.

During the 1st century BCE the Romans settled in camps (&quot;Castra Cecilia&quot; and &quot;Castra Servilia&quot;) permanently around the hill where the &quot;Norba Caesarina&quot; colony would be located next to the important communications route that would later be known as &quot;Vía de la Plata&quot;.

The old municipality of Aldea Moret, 2 km to the southwest, is currently a neighborhood of the same name integrated into the city, around which two Roman archaeological sites can be seen: Cuarto Roble and El Junquillo. The signposted Vía de la Plata can be traveled south of the city. An excavated section in Valdesalor, where the road crosses the Salor River through a recently restored medieval bridge, occupies the place of an ancient Roman bridge, now lost.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the city was occupied by the Visigoths, until the Arabs conquered Cáceres in the 8th century. The city spent the next few centuries mostly under Arab rule, although power alternated several times between Moors and Christians. During this time, the Arabs rebuilt the city, including a wall, palaces, and various towers, including the Torre de Bujaco. Cáceres was reconquered by the Christians in the 13th century (1229).

During this period the city had an important Jewish quarter: in the 15th century when the total population was 2,000, nearly 140 Jewish families lived in Cáceres. The Jewish population was expelled by Queen Isabel I (Isabella I) of Castile and Fernando II (Ferdinand II) of Aragon in 1492, but many remains of the Jewish presence of the period can still be seen today in the Barrio San Antonio.

===Middle Ages===

Around the 5th century, the Visigoths devastated the Roman settlement, and until the 8th-9th century the city was not heard of again.
During the first centuries of the &quot;Reconquista&quot; (Reconquest), it was the Muslims, from North Africa, who took advantage of the strategic place on which the primitive Roman colony was based as a military base to confront the Christian kingdoms of the north. Thus, in the year 1147 Abd al-Mumin refounded the city on the Hispano-Roman and Visigoth remains. The current name of &quot;Vía de la Plata&quot; comes from Arabic, the name of the Roman road that linked Astorga with Mérida (from the Arabic &quot;balata&quot; (road), from which the word &quot;silver&quot; was derived).

The Christian Reconquest of Cáceres occurred in 1229, the result of a long process that from the second half of the 12th century to the beginning of the 13th century. During this period, which began in 1142 with the conquest of Coria, the Tagus River marked an unstable border between Christians to the north and Muslims to the south. The kingdom of Castile partly ignored the possibilities of conquering this area; attempts to incorporate Cáceres came from the kingdom of Portugal and the kingdom of León, which both wanted to expand their width in their southern expansions. The Portuguese Geraldo Sempavor conquered Cáceres in the mid-12th century in a campaign that began in 1165 and reached the entire center of present-day Extremadura, but an alliance between Ferdinand II of León and the Almohads gave the Leonese control of the town in 1170.

The Almohads carried out an expedition in 1174 in which they managed to regain control of Cáceres. Except for an attempted siege in 1183, the Leonese did not approach the Muslim town again until the 13th century. After the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, the conquest of Alcántara took place in 1213, after which the Christians besieged Cáceres in 1218, 1222, 1223 and 1225, producing the definitive Reconquest on 23 April 1229. Although the conquest was led by Alfonso IX of León, becoming part of the Kingdom of León, the death of Alfonso IX in 1230 led to Cáceres becoming part of the Crown of Castile and León.

The privileges of the reconquered town were granted by Alfonso IX and configured Cáceres as a royal town directly dependent on the Leonese Crown with no local government other than its own council. Through this jurisdiction, the Crown reserved a notable portion of land between those of the Order of Santiago and those of the Order of Alcántara.

Cáceres flourished during the Reconquista and the Discovery of the Americas, as influential Spanish families and nobles built homes and small palaces there, and many members of families from Extremadura participated in voyages to the Americas where they made their fortunes.

In the 15th century, the city suffered from internal disputes among the nobility. The Catholic Monarchs issued several ordinances and provisions to try to pacify the local nobles; The most notable was issued by Isabel I (Isabella I) in 1477, during her stay in the town on the occasion of the War of the Castilian Succession, whereby it was established that the twelve aldermen of the council would become perpetual. The prohibition of stately properties in this jurisdiction prevented the formation of a strong nobility, leaving the town governed by a mesocracy of agricultural knights.

The Old Town (&quot;Parte Antigua&quot;) still has its ancient walls; this part of town is also well known for its multitude of storks&#x27; nests. The walls contain a medieval town setting with no outward signs of modernity, which is why many television shows and films have been shot there.
Cáceres was declared a World Heritage City by UNESCO in 1986 because of the city&#x27;s blend of Roman, Moorish, Northern Gothic and Italian Renaissance architecture. Thirty towers from the Islamic period still stand in Cáceres, of which the Torre del Bujaco is the most famous.

===Modern Age===

During the War of the Communities of Castile, Caceres joined the rebel ranks. On 15 April 1522, the monarch granted amnesty to the city, with the exception of the most committed community members.

In 1653 the town of Cáceres, along with five other towns in the current autonomous community, acquired a joint vote in the Cortes of Castile, giving rise to the purchase of the vote to the province of Extremadura, which in 1822 would be divided into those of Cáceres and Badajoz. Cáceres was represented in the Cortes of Madrid from 1660 to 1664 as part of said joint vote.

Until the 18th century, Cáceres was just another town among the many in Extremadura. In the Cadastre of Ensenada, carried out in Cáceres in 1753, it is indicated that only 1,698 families lived in the town itself. However, during the second half of the 18th century, the town began to grow, motivated by the arrival of both temporary and permanent foreign settlers, whose presence gave rise to the formation of a local bourgeoisie that until then did not exist due to the rural nature of the population. Starting in the mid-18th century, ranchers from the center of the peninsula, many of them from the Sierra de Cameros, began to settle in Extremadura, fleeing the crisis suffered by transhumance. Prominent textile merchants from Cameros and Catalonia also settled here.

===Evolution from town to city===

In 1790 a decisive event occurred in the history of Cáceres that made it evolve over time from a simple town to a city with regional importance: Charles IV established there the headquarters of the Royal Court of Extremadura, the highest judicial body of the region. Numerous officials and professionals from very different places in Spain began to settle in the town, which increased the weight of the local bourgeoisie. At the beginning of the 19th century, merchant neighborhoods could already be distinguished in the Old Town extramuros (outside the walls), with their houses located in the Plaza Mayor and in several streets in its surroundings such as Barrionuevo, Empedrada, Parras, Pintores and Santo Domingo.

The judiciary was not the only public sector that provided urban character at that time: the defective division into provinces of the Crown of Castile caused many enlightened people to demand the division of Extremadura into two provinces, which benefited Cáceres by establishing itself as the provincial capital. In 1810, the French tried to create the prefecture of Cáceres during the Peninsular War, with limits similar to those of the current province. Ten years later and during the Liberal Triennium in 1822 the province of Cáceres was created with its capital in this town. 

===Civil war===

In the Spanish Civil War, the military forces of Cáceres supported the coup d&#x27;état of 1936. When the rebel forces freed the Falangist Luna, he mobilized about a thousand sympathizers in the city and began to issue orders to occupy the principal surrounding towns, as well as the capture of the main strategic points such as the border points with Portugal, ports, and bridges. The repression by the Francoists began immediately, with the assassination of the director of Union and Labor, Pedro Montero Rubio, and the mayor of Cáceres Antonio Canales González, among others, a total of more than 600 people shot, about 220 during Christmas 1937. The constitutional governor and mayor were imprisoned and replaced by soldiers; the first, Ignacio Mateos Guija, was shot dead by Falangists and four relatives were thrown into the Tagus River, and the business run by his father was illegally confiscated.

The uprising in Cáceres facilitated General Francisco Franco&#x27;s advance along the roads of Mérida and Badajoz. On 26 August 1936, General Franco arrived in Cáceres, where he established his headquarters before beginning the advance on Madrid. There he received his wife Carmen and his daughter, whom he had not seen since the day of the military coup d&#x27;état. Between 8 and 10 October 1936, and on the occasion of Franco&#x27;s request for military aid to Hitler, The first Panzer I model battle tanks arrived at the Arguijuelas de Abajo and Arriba castles, which had arrived in Seville by boat. For several months, a training academy for armored vehicle drivers was established in the castles, directed by the German colonel Wilhelm von Thoma. Later the training academy was moved to Cubas de la Sagra, in the province of Madrid and its military equipment took part in combat near the Madrid fronts. The Cáceres airfield also had important air movements, from which the aircraft that attacked the Republican forces and the Condor Legion departed.

One of the few reactions of the Republican forces was the bombing of the city on 23 July 1937. That day five Soviet twin-engine Tupolev aircraft under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Jaume Mata Romeu, of the Air Force of the Spanish Republic, which had taken off from the Los Llanos de Albacete airfield, dropped 18 bombs, which affected various buildings (such as the Mayorazgo Palace), the food market, Santa María, the back of the Civil Guard barracks, the town hall, and Nido and Sancti Espíritu streets, causing 35 deaths and numerous injuries.

==Historic quarter==

The walls contain a medieval town setting with no outward signs of modernity, which is why many television shows and films have been shot there, including scenes for Game of Thrones and the Spanish series Isabel.

The &quot;Monumental City of Cáceres&quot; was declared by the Council of Europe as the Third Monumental Complex of Europe in 1968 (after Prague and Tallinn) and World Heritage by Unesco in 1986. Cáceres also has other awards: Pomme d&#x27;Or to &quot;Tourism Merit&quot;, awarded by the International Federation of Tourism Journalists and Writers in 1996; Les Etoiles d&#x27;Or du Jumelage, awarded by the European Commission in 1999; The Archival prize awarded to him by the Association for the Recovery of Historical Centers in 2004 and the Citizens 2008 Award granted by the Association of Radio and Digital Television Entities, with the collaboration of the Citizen Audiovisual Council for the support that the citizenship provided to The candidacy for the European Capital of Culture of 2016. Cáceres is also a member of the Roads Networks of Sefarad, of the Vía de la Plata, being chosen by the Autonomous Community as Cultural Capital of Extremadura Enclave 92, and together with the solidarity effort of The administrations, private companies, official entities and private citizens, aspired between 2003 and 2010 to be European Capital of Culture in the year 2016.

<text>Lugo is a province of northwestern Spain, in the northeastern part of the autonomous community of Galicia. It is bordered by the provinces of Ourense, Pontevedra, and A Coruña, the principality of Asturias, the State of León, and in the north by the Cantabrian Sea (Bay of Biscay).

The population is 331,327 (2018), of whom a quarter live in the capital Lugo. The capital city was an ancient Celtic settlement named in honour of the god Lugh (see Lyon), later Latinised as &quot;Lucus Augusti&quot;, and which became one of the three main important Galician-Roman centres alongside Braccara Augusta and Asturica Augusta (modern Braga and Astorga respectively). The province has 67 municipalities.

==Languages==
The vast majority of people have a common language, Galician. Some people, especially the older generation, are monolingual in Galician. There are only a few people bilingual in Galician and Castilian: just over 10,000 inhabitants. Even in the capital, the vitality of Galician in conversation is very strong.

The inhabitants speak several variants of Galician in the province of Lugo. They have the characteristics of being the closest to León isoglosses and therefore also Castilian. That makes them they some grammatical and phonetic signs that are mistakenly considered influences of Castilian or of Leonese. However, the Galician spoken in Lugo, especially in non-coastal areas, is probably the most conservative in Galicia because almost no historic pressure from Castilian has existed on the rural population.

==Population==
The historical population is given in the following chart:

==Estuaries==
The estuaries of the Lugo province are part of the Atlas estuaries. From west to east they are:

<doc id="143665" wikidata="Q95038" url="?curid=143665" title="Province of Ourense">
<text>Ourense (; ) is a province of Spain, in the southeastern part of the autonomous community of Galicia. It is bordered by the provinces of Pontevedra to the west, Lugo to the north, León and Zamora, (which both belong to Castile and León) to the east, and by Portugal to the south. With an area of 7,278 square km., it is the only landlocked province in Galicia. The provincial capital, Ourense, is the largest population centre, with the rest of the province being predominantly rural.

==Denomination==
&quot;Ourense&quot; (in Galician) is the official name adopted by Parliament in Spain, according to Law 2/1998.

==Geography==
Ourense is surrounded by mountains on all sides. These mountains historically isolated the province from the more populated Galician coast. Until a highway was built in recent years linking Ourense with Vigo in the west and Benavente in the east, the only quick way for people to enter or leave the province was by railway.

The principal river system is the Miño-Sil, the fertile valleys of which produce corn (maize) and grapes for wine. Due to the many rapids these rivers are not navigable, but they have been harnessed for hydroelectric power. The Sil flows through a deep canyon and has become a sought-after tourist site for its river cruises and views.

The Limia River begins north of Xinzo de Limia and flows south towards Portugal; the Lindoso reservoir is on this river as it crosses the border into Portugal. The Tâmega River, another important Portuguese river begins north of Verín. 

The mountainous terrain and isolation have kept the province economically challenged and encouraged much emigration to the rest of Spain and to the New World. There is some wine production along the Miño valley and near Verín. There is also considerable pig breeding and potato growing, especially around the area of Xinzo da Limia, in the drained lakebed of Antela, which until the 1960s was the largest fresh-water lake in Spain.

===Protected areas===
The province has several protected areas and some natural parks, including:
*Baixa Limia-Serra do Xures, near the border with Portugal
*Natural Park da Serra de Enciña da Lastra
*O Invernadeiro

==Demography==
Of the province&#x27;s population of 309,986 (2018), about 30 per cent in the capital, Ourense, with 105,000 inhabitants. There are 92 municipalities in Ourense. Other than the capital the most important are O Barco de Valdeorras, Verín, Ribadavia, Allariz, A Rua, O Carballiño, Viana do Bolo, and Xinzo de Limia. As of 2018, Ourense has the lowest birthrate of any Spanish province, posting a population growth rate of -2,993.

===Population development===
The historical population is given in the following chart:
==Economy==
Industries include chemical manufacture, milk production, water bottling near Verín, and clothing manufacture near the capital city of Ourense. One of the largest poultry processing companies is also located in the industrial zone near that city.

The province has also four wine regions, out of five in the whole region of Galicia. Ribeiro, Ribeira Sacra, Monterrei and Valdeorras.

Although not a major tourist center, tourism contributes somewhat to the economy. The river valleys attract holidaymakers, and there are several preserved medieval towns (Allariz and Ribadavia).

<text>The Province of Las Palmas (, ; ) is a province of Spain, consisting of the eastern part of the autonomous community of the Canary Islands. Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, capital city of this province and of the island of Gran Canaria, is the largest city in the Canary Islands.

In 1927, the Province of Canary Islands was split into two provinces: Las Palmas and Santa Cruz de Tenerife. In 1982, both provinces became part of the newly founded autonomous community of the Canary Islands.

==Geography==

===Composition===
It consists of about half of the Atlantic archipelago, including the islands of Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura, and Lanzarote, as well as another six minor isles (Alegranza, Graciosa, Montaña Clara, Lobos, Roque del Este, and Roque del Oeste). Their total land area is , representing 54.6% of the Canary Islands&#x27; total land. (The other half of the archipelago is the Province of Santa Cruz.)

===General view===
Its capital is the city of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, on the island of Gran Canaria, which is also one of the capitals of the autonomous community (next to Santa Cruz de Tenerife). About 33.2% of the provincial population of 1,145,843 (2023) live in the capital. The name &quot;Las Palmas&quot; is generally used to refer to both the city and the province. There are 34 municipalities in the province; see List of municipalities in Las Palmas.

<text>Province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, also Province of Santa Cruz (), is a province of Spain, consisting of the western part of the autonomous community of the Canary Islands. It consists of about half of the Atlantic archipelago: the islands of Tenerife, La Gomera, El Hierro, and La Palma. It occupies an area of . It also includes a series of adjacent roques (those of Salmor, Fasnia, Bonanza, Garachico and Anaga).

Its capital is the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (commonly known as &quot;Santa Cruz&quot;), on the island of Tenerife (Spain&#x27;s most populous island). At the start of 2023 the province had 1,067,173 inhabitants and a density of 315.6 /km2, making it the province of Spain with the sixth highest population density, higher than that of the province of Las Palmas (the eastern half of the Canary Islands). 19.6% live in the capital, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, which is also the capital of the Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands. There are 54 municipalities in the province; see List of municipalities in Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Tenerife is the most populated island of the Canary Islands and most populous island of Spain. In addition, the island also has the highest altitude of Spain and all of the Atlantic Islands (Teide 3718 m).

Earlier issued vehicle license plates in this province bear the first two letters &quot;TF&quot; (named after Tenerife). Nowadays the plates share the same numbering system as in mainland Spain.

== History ==
This province was established in 1927, when the Canarias province (with Santa Cruz de Tenerife as the capital city) was divided into two provinces: Las Palmas and the province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. In 1982, both provinces became part of the newly founded autonomous community of the Canary Islands.

==Population==
The historical population is given in the following chart:
== National parks ==
This province contains three of Spain&#x27;s national parks, more than any other province: the Caldera de Taburiente National Park on La Palma, the Garajonay National Park on La Gomera, and the Teide National Park on Tenerife, encompassing Teide, Spain&#x27;s highest mountain and also an inactive volcano.

== Main sights (Tenerife) ==

*Mount Teide: is a volcano on Tenerife in the Canary Islands. Its -high summit is the highest point in Spain, the highest point above sea level in the islands of the Atlantic, and it is the third highest volcano in the world measured from its base on the ocean floor, after Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea located in Hawaii. The volcano and its surroundings comprise the Teide National Park, is also one of the most visited National Parks in the world, with a total of 2.8 million visitors, according to the Instituto Canario de Estadística (ISTAC). The park has an area of and was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO on 29 June 2007.
*Auditorio de Tenerife: Was designed by architect Santiago Calatrava Valls, construction began in 1997 and was completed in 2003. The auditorium was inaugurated on 26 September of that year with the presence of Felipe de Borbón, Prince of Asturias, and was later visited by former U.S. President Bill Clinton. The building is framed within the tenets of late-modern architecture of the late 20th century. The majestic profile of the auditorium has become an architectural symbol of the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. It is also regarded as the finest modern building in the Canary Islands and one of the most emblematic buildings of Spanish architecture.
*The Basilica of Our Lady of Candelaria (in Candelaria): The place where the image of the Virgin of Candelaria (saint patron of the Canary Islands) can be found, this sanctuary is built in neoclassical style, and is visited daily by the parishioners, who visit the Villa Mariana out of devotion to the Virgin. Is the first Marian shrine of the Canary Islands, the principal catholic center of peregrination of the Canary Islands and one of the principal ones of Spain, the basilica hosts more than 2,5 million visitors annually.
*San Cristóbal de La Laguna: Is third-most populous city of the archipelago and second-most populous city of the island. Its economy is business-oriented while agriculture dominates the northeastern portion of the city. The urban area dominates the central and the southern parts. Tourism covers the northern coast. The main industry includes some manufacturing. La Laguna historical center was declared World Heritage Site by the UNESCO in 1999. In 2010 after a survey, La Laguna was listed as the city with the best reputation in the Canary Islands and the third no provincial capital city of Spain with the best reputation, but behind Gijon and Marbella.
*Museo de la Naturaleza y el Hombre: Is a museum based in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, it contains many significant archaeological finds and is considered the best repository of objects from the Prehispanic Canary Islands. The museum also houses significant paleontological, botanical, entomological and marine and terrestrial vertebrate collections, in an excellent state of preservation, and is considered the best Natural Library of the Canary Islands. The museum also integrates the Archaeological Museum of Tenerife, the Bioantropología&#x27;s Canary Institute and the Museum of Natural Sciences of Tenerife. The museum is located in the downtown area of Santa Cruz, in the former Civil Hospital, a building that constitutes an example of the neoclassical architecture of Canary Islands. The archaeological section was founded in 1958. The museum holds the largest collection on the culture of the Guanche and also has one of the most modern methods of presentation of mummies, (announced in 2006 by the Cabildo de Tenerife through a communique). It is also an internationally renowned museum and has participated in international meetings on archeology, but its fame is mainly due to its formidable collection of Guanche mummies.
*Los Cristianos: Is a town situated on the south coast of Tenerife. Located in the municipality of Arona between the cone of the mountain Chayofita and the greater mountain Guaza. The town centre is around the Los Cristianos bay, but is rapidly expanding inland with modern development. The town is a popular tourist resort and includes a ferry port.
*The Cathedral of San Cristóbal de La Laguna: Is a Catholic cathedral in Tenerife, Spain. Begun in 1904 and completed in 1915, it is dedicated to the Virgin of Los Remedios. This is one of the most important temples of the Canary Islands. Located in the city of San Cristóbal de La Laguna.
*Puerto de la Cruz: Is a city and municipality located on the north coast of Tenerife, in the Orotava Valley. Prior to the development of hotels and buildings, much of the area consisted of agricultural land. Considerable fiscal pressure led to the land being developed and the population shifted from rural to urban and tourism. The population is mainly urban today.

<doc id="143673" wikidata="Q43279" url="?curid=143673" title="Wembley Stadium (1923)">
<text>The former Wembley Stadium (; originally known as the Empire Stadium) was a football stadium in Wembley, London, best known for hosting important football matches. It stood on the same site now occupied by its successor and by its predecessor, Watkin&#x27;s Tower.

Wembley hosted the FA Cup final annually, the first in 1923, which was the stadium&#x27;s inaugural event, the League Cup final annually, five European Cup finals, the 1966 World Cup final, and the final of Euro 1996. Brazilian footballer Pelé once said of the stadium: &quot;Wembley is the cathedral of football. It is the capital of football and it is the heart of football&quot;, in recognition of its status as the world&#x27;s most famous football stadium.

The stadium also hosted many other sports events, including the 1948 Summer Olympics, rugby league&#x27;s Challenge Cup final, and the 1992 and 1995 Rugby League World Cup finals. It was also the venue for numerous music events, including the 1985 Live Aid charity concert. In what was the first major WWF (now WWE) pay-per-view to take place outside North America, it hosted the 1992 SummerSlam.

==History==
The stadium&#x27;s first turf was cut by King George V and it was first opened to the public on 28 April 1923. Much of Humphry Repton&#x27;s original Wembley Park landscape was transformed in 1922–23 during preparations for the British Empire Exhibition of 1924–25. First known as the &quot;British Empire Exhibition Stadium&quot; or simply the &quot;Empire Stadium&quot;, it was built by Sir Robert McAlpine for the British Empire Exhibition of 1924 (extended to 1925).

The stadium cost £750,000 (equivalent to approximately £46 million in 2020) and was constructed on the site of a folly called Watkin&#x27;s Tower. The architects were Sir John Simpson and Maxwell Ayrton and the head engineer Sir Owen Williams. The original intention was to demolish the stadium at the end of the Exhibition, but it was saved at the suggestion of Sir James Stevenson, a Scot who was chairman of the organising committee for the Empire Exhibition. The ground had been used for football as early as the 1880s.

At the end of the exhibition, which proved to be a financial disappointment, the site at Wembley was considered by many to be a vast &#x27;white elephant&#x27;. It was bought by a property speculator, James White, who planned to sell off the buildings for redevelopment, including the stadium which had been the centrepiece of the exhibition. Arthur Elvin, an ex-RFC officer who had worked in a tobacco kiosk at the exhibition and had previous experience working for a scrap metal firm, was employed by White to oversee the sale of the buildings and the clearance of the Wembley site.

The stadium had gone into liquidation after it was pronounced &quot;financially unviable&quot;. After nine months, having earned a good sum from selling various buildings on the site, Elvin agreed to buy the stadium from White for a total of £127,000 as a £12,000 downpayment and the balance plus interest payable over ten years.

 Facing personal bankruptcy, White killed himself at his home, King Edward&#x27;s Place, in 1927. This caused financial complications for Elvin, requiring him to raise money within two weeks to buy the stadium before it too was demolished. He was able to finance this by forming the &#x27;Wembley Stadium and Greyhound Racecourse Company&#x27;. He raised the money to buy the stadium at the original price he had agreed with White, then immediately sold it back to the company, leaving him with a healthy personal profit. Instead of cash, he received shares in the company, which gave him the largest individual stake in Wembley Stadium, and subsequently became chairman.

The electric scoreboard and the all-encircling roof, made from aluminium and translucent glass, were added in 1963.

In 1977 fences were erected around the pitch following the England vs Scotland match when Scotland fans invaded the pitch and vandalised the pitch and goalposts. These fences were taken down following the Hillsborough disaster in 1989.
The stadium&#x27;s distinctive Twin Towers became its trademark and nickname. Also well known were the 39 steps needed to be climbed to reach the Royal box and collect a trophy (and winners&#x27;/losers&#x27; medals). In 1934, the Empire Pool was built nearby. The &quot;Wembley Stadium Collection&quot; is held by the National Football Museum. The stadium closed in October 2000 and demolition commenced in December 2002, completing in 2003 for redevelopment. The top of one of the twin towers was erected as a memorial in the park on the north side of Overton Close in the nearby Saint Raphael&#x27;s Estate.

The cities of Birmingham and Coventry launched bids to become the new home of England&#x27;s football team following disputes and a political row regarding the new Wembley&#x27;s construction. These bids were ultimately unsuccessful as the FA chose in 2002 to keep the national team at the new Wembley once completed.

==Football==
Wembley is best known for hosting football matches, having hosted the FA Cup Final annually as well as numerous England International fixtures.

===White Horse Final===


The Empire Stadium was built in exactly 300 days at the cost of £750,000. Described as the world&#x27;s greatest sporting arena, it was ready only four days before the &quot;White Horse&quot; final in 1923. The FA had not considered admission by ticket, grossly underestimating the number of fans who arrived at the 104 gates on match day. However, after this match, every event apart from the 1982 replay was ticketed.

The first event held at the stadium was the 1923 FA Cup final on 28 April between Bolton Wanderers and West Ham United. This is known as the White Horse Final. Such was the eagerness to attend the final at the new national stadium that vast numbers of people crammed through the 104 turnstiles into the stadium, far exceeding its official 127,000 capacity. The crowds overflowed onto the pitch as there was no room on the terraces. Estimates of the number of fans in attendance range from 240,000 to well over 300,000.

It was thought that the match would not be played because of the number of spectators inside the stadium that had spilled onto the pitch, until mounted police, including Police Constable George Scorey and his white horse, &quot;Billy&quot;, slowly pushed the crowds back to the sides of the field of play to allow the match to kick off just 45 minutes late. In honour of Billy, the footbridge outside the new Wembley Stadium has been named the White Horse Bridge. The official attendance is often quoted as 126,047. The match saw a 2–0 victory for Bolton Wanderers, with David Jack scoring the first ever goal at Wembley.

===Matthews Final===

The 1953 FA Cup final between Blackpool and Bolton Wanderers was dubbed the &quot;Matthews final&quot; after Blackpool&#x27;s winger Stanley Matthews. At age 38, he was making his third and ultimately his final attempt at winning an FA Cup medal. In the previous six years, he failed to earn a winner&#x27;s medal against Manchester United in 1948 and Newcastle United in 1951. It featured a hat-trick by Blackpool&#x27;s Stan Mortensen in his side&#x27;s 4–3 win, with Matthews almost single-handedly turning the match around for Blackpool, who had trailed 3–1 to Bolton Wanderers before fighting back to win the match. It remained the only hat-trick ever scored in an FA Cup Final at the original Wembley.

The FA Cup final was played there in April or May until 2000 (excluding the 1970 replay when Chelsea beat Leeds United at Old Trafford). It was also the venue for finals of the FA Amateur Cup, League Cup (except for the early years when this was settled on a home and away basis) and in later years the Associate Members&#x27; Cup and the Football League promotion play-off finals (in the early years of play-offs they were home and away fixtures). The 1988 final of the Middlesex Charity Cup was also played there.

===International fixtures===

Prior to the 1923 Wembley stadium, international football games had been played by England at various stadia. Most early internationals (including the first ever international football match (1870)) were played at The Oval, which opened in 1845 as the home ground of Surrey County Cricket Club and would in 1880 host the first Test match played in England. For the first 27 years, the only International England games played at Wembley were fixtures against Scotland, with other games played elsewhere until 1951. The first team other than Scotland to face England at the venue was Argentina. In 1956 and 1971, it was the venue of the home matches of the Great Britain national football team for the qualification matches to the Summer Olympic Games against Bulgaria.
In 1966, it was the leading venue of the FIFA World Cup. It hosted nine matches, including the final, where tournament hosts England won 4–2 after extra time against West Germany. Seven years later, Wembley was the venue for a specially arranged friendly between teams called &quot;The Three&quot; and &quot;The Six&quot; to celebrate the United Kingdom joining the European Economic Community. The match finished 2–0 to &quot;The Three&quot;.

In 1996, it was the principal venue of UEFA Euro 1996, hosting all of England&#x27;s matches, as well as the tournament&#x27;s final, where Germany won the UEFA European Championship for a third time after defeating the Czech Republic 2–1 with the first international golden goal in football history. Germany had earlier defeated England on penalties in the semi-final after a 1–1 draw, with Gareth Southgate having his penalty saved against England in the shoot-out.

England&#x27;s final two competitive matches played at the stadium resulted in 0–1 defeats for England to Scotland and Germany respectively. The first defeat was in the play off for the Euro 2000 qualifiers in November 1999, but England still went through as they won the other leg 2–0 at Hampden Park. However, the final match at Wembley was the opening qualifier for the 2002 World Cup, and defeat prompted the resignation of England manager Kevin Keegan at the end of the match after 18 months in charge.

====1966 World Cup====

====Euro 1996====

===Club football===

In all, the stadium hosted five European Cup finals, a record for the continent&#x27;s top football tournament until the inauguration of the new Wembley Stadium in 2007. The first two were 1963 final between Milan and Benfica, and the 1968 final between Manchester United and Benfica. In 1971, it again hosted the final, between Ajax and Panathinaikos, and once more in 1978, this time between Liverpool and Club Brugge, another in 1992, when Barcelona played Sampdoria.

Wembley has also hosted two European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup finals: in 1965, when West Ham United defeated 1860 Munich, and in 1993, when Parma defeated Royal Antwerp.

It was also the venue for Arsenal&#x27;s home Champions League matches in 1998–99 and 1999–2000. It has hosted clubs&#x27; home matches on two other occasions; in 1930, when Leyton Orient played two home Third Division South matches while their Lea Bridge Stadium was undergoing urgent remedial works; and in 1930–31 for eight matches by non-League Ealing A.F.C. It was also to be the home of the amateur club which made several applications to join the Football League, the Argonauts.

In March 1998, Arsenal made a bid to purchase Wembley in the hope of gaining a larger stadium to replace their Highbury ground, which had a capacity of less than 40,000 and was unsuitable for expansion. However, the bid was later abandoned in favour of building the 60,000 capacity Emirates Stadium, which was opened in 2006.

===Last matches===
On 20 May 2000, the last FA Cup final to be played at the old Wembley saw Chelsea defeat Aston Villa with the only goal scored by Roberto Di Matteo. The final competitive club match there was the 2000 First Division play-off final on 29 May, between Ipswich Town and Barnsley, a 4–2 win resulting in promotion to the Premier League for Ipswich.

The last club match of all was the 2000 Charity Shield, in which Chelsea defeated Manchester United 2–0. The last international match was on 7 October, in Kevin Keegan&#x27;s last game as England manager. England were defeated 0–1 by Germany, with Dietmar Hamann scoring the last goal at the original Wembley.
On that day, Tony Adams made his 60th Wembley appearance, a record for any player. Adams also claimed England&#x27;s final goal at the stadium, having scored in the previous home fixture against Ukraine on 31 May.

==Other sports==

===Rugby league===

In the sport of rugby league, the RFL held its Challenge Cup Final at Wembley from 1929 onwards. The stadium was also regularly used by the sport for major international matches, such as Great Britain versus Australia. In 1949 the France national rugby league team became the first France national team of any sport to win at Wembley. The largest crowd for a Challenge Cup Final at Wembley was set in 1985 when Wigan beat Hull F.C. 28–24 in front of 99,801 spectators, which as of 2017 remains the second highest rugby league attendance in England behind only the 1954 Challenge Cup Final replay at Bradford&#x27;s Odsal Stadium when a then world record attendance of 102,575 saw Warrington defeat Halifax 8–4 (the original 1954 cup final at Wembley, drawn 4–4, was played in front of 81,841 fans).

The stadium set the international record crowd for a rugby league game when 73,631 turned out for the 1992 Rugby League World Cup final between Great Britain and Australia (since beaten by the 74,468 attendance for the 2013 RLWC Final at Old Trafford). The Mal Meninga-led Australian team won the game 10–6 on the back of a Steve Renouf try in the north-east corner and Meninga&#x27;s goal kicking. The 1995 World Cup Final between England and Australia was also played at Wembley with 66,540 spectators watching Australia win 16–8. The final of the 1999 Challenge Cup was the last to be played at the stadium and was attended by 73,242 fans, with the annual fixture moving to other grounds (Murrayfield Stadium, Millennium Stadium and Twickenham) before returning to the new Wembley upon its completion in 2007.

====Internationals====
===1948 Summer Olympics===

Wembley was the main venue for the 1948 Summer Olympics, with Fanny Blankers-Koen and Emil Zátopek among the notable winners in athletics. The Stadium also hosted the semifinals and finals of the Olympic hockey and football tournaments, the Prix des Nations event in the equestrian competition, and a demonstration match of lacrosse.

===Speedway===

Motorcycle speedway first took place at Wembley in 1929, and operated until the outbreak of World War II in 1939, a few days before the 1939 World Championship Final was due to be held, but it was cancelled as a result of the war. The Wembley Lions returned in 1946 and operated in the top flight until the end of the 1956 season winning a number of League titles. A short lived revival saw the Lions in the British League in the 1970 and 1971 seasons. Lionel Van Praag (1936), Tommy Price (1949), and Freddie Williams (1950 and 1953), all won World Championships whilst riding for Wembley. The ashes for the speedway track were supplied by Richard Biffa Ltd whose operating base at the time was in Wembley Hill Road. Richard Biffa later became Biffa Waste Services. The Lions were formed by the Wembley Stadium chairman Sir Arthur Elvin.

Between 1936 and 1960 Wembley hosted all of the first 15 finals of the Speedway World Championship. It hosted another nine World Finals before the last one at Wembley took place in 1981 in front of 92,500 fans, just shy of the venue&#x27;s record speedway attendance of 95,000 set at the 1938 World Final.

Riders who won the World Championship at Wembley include; inaugural champion Lionel Van Praag (Australia), Jack Milne (United States), Bluey Wilkinson (Australia), Tommy Price (England), Freddie Williams (Wales), Jack Young (Australia – the first two-time winner, first back-to-back winner and the first second division rider to win the title), Ronnie Moore (New Zealand), Ove Fundin (Sweden), Barry Briggs (New Zealand), Peter Craven (England), Björn Knutson (Sweden), Ole Olsen (Denmark), Bruce Penhall (United States – the winner of the 1981 World Final), and legendary New Zealand rider Ivan Mauger. With four wins, Sweden&#x27;s Ove Fundin won the most World Championships at Wembley, winning in 1956, 1960, 1963 and 1967.

Wembley also hosted the Final of the Speedway World Team Cup in 1968, 1970 and 1973 won by Great Britain (1968 and 1973) and Sweden (1970).

The speedway track at Wembley Stadium was in length and was notoriously difficult to ride for those not used to it. Despite regularly being used for World Championship and other British championship meetings, Wembley long had a reputation as a track that was difficult to pass on which often led to processional racing. Among those who never performed well there despite their credentials include 1973 World Champion Jerzy Szczakiel (who won his title at home in Poland and two weeks later under difficult circumstances failed to score in the World Team Cup Final at Wembley), while others such as Ivan Mauger and Ole Olsen often seemed to find their best form at the stadium. The track itself was located inside of the greyhound racing track, but intersected the stadium&#x27;s playing field at the corners. The pits were located in the tunnel at the eastern end of the stadium.

The track record at Wembley will forever be held by Denmark&#x27;s World Champion of 1984, 1985 &amp; 1988 Erik Gundersen. In Heat 6 of the 1981 World Final, Gundersen set the 4-lap record (clutch start) of 66.8 seconds. As this was the last time the stadium was used for speedway racing, it remains the track record.

===Stock car racing===
Two meetings were held at Wembley in 1974 promoted by Trevor Redmond. The first meeting held featured BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars and National Hot Rods. The second meeting featured the BriSCA Formula 2 Stock Cars World Final with F1s in support. Before the first meeting the Wembley groundsman threatened to resign over possible damage to the hallowed turf. The pitch was surrounded by wooden beams and little damage was caused.

===Rugby union===
Though the venue was not traditionally a regular host of rugby union matches, England played a friendly against Canada on 17 October 1992, as their regular home stadium at Twickenham was undergoing redevelopment. Wales played their Five Nations and autumn international home matches at Wembley (as Twickenham Stadium would not accommodate them) while Cardiff Arms Park was being rebuilt as the Millennium Stadium in the late 1990s (a deal reciprocated for FA Cups during the construction of the new Wembley Stadium). In total there were seven internationals.

===Greyhound racing===

Wembley was a regular venue for greyhound racing. It was the first sport Sir Arthur Elvin introduced to the stadium. The opening meeting was in 1927. The greyhound racing provided the stadium with its main source of regular income, especially in the early decades, and continued to attract crowds of several thousand up until the early 1960s. The stadium staged its last greyhound race meeting in December 1998 with the owners, the Greyhound Racing Association, citing economic reasons and the lack of plans for a greyhound track in the stadium&#x27;s redevelopment.

Two of the biggest events in the greyhound racing calendar were the St Leger and Trafalgar Cup. Both were originally held at Wembley, the St Leger from 1928 until 1998 after which it moved to Wimbledon Stadium and the Trafalgar Cup from 1929 until 1998 after which it moved to Oxford Stadium. In 1931 the famous greyhound Mick the Miller won the St Leger.

Wembley&#x27;s owners&#x27; refusal to cancel the regular greyhound racing meant that the match between Uruguay and France in the 1966 FIFA World Cup was played at White City.

===American football===
The National Football League (NFL) held nine preseason American football games at Wembley between 1983 and 1993. The Minnesota Vikings and the St. Louis Cardinals played the first game on 6 August 1983. The Detroit Lions and the Dallas Cowboys played the last game on 8 August 1993. The United States Football League also played an exhibition game there on 21 July 1984 between the Philadelphia Stars and Tampa Bay Bandits. The London Monarchs of the World League of American Football played at the venue in 1991 and 1992. Wembley hosted World Bowl &#x27;91, the inaugural World Bowl, where the Monarchs defeated the Barcelona Dragons 21–0.

===Gaelic football===
From 1958 until the mid-1970s, hurling and gaelic football tournaments known as the &quot;Wembley Tournaments&quot; were held at Wembley Stadium to bring the Irish sports to expatriates in Britain at the time. Several Gaelic football games were played in Wembley Stadium, most of them exhibition matches, most notably Kerry and Down in 1961.

===Horse of the year show===
In April 1970 this show jumping event was held at Wembley Stadium. This left the grass turf in poor condition for the FA Cup Final a week later.

===Other events===
The stadium also staged women&#x27;s field hockey matches in which England appeared in their annual match between 1951 and 1969 and then from 1971 to 1991. The best-attended field hockey match of all time took place at the Wembley Stadium on 11 March 1978, when 65,165 people showed up for a game between England and the United States.

On 18 June 1963, Wembley hosted a heavyweight boxing match between London native boxer Henry Cooper and American rising star Muhammad Ali in front of 35,000 spectators.

On 26 May 1975, in front of 90,000 people, Evel Knievel crashed while trying to land a jump over 13 single decker city buses, an accident which resulted in his initial retirement from his daredevil life.

In 1992, the World Wrestling Federation (now known as WWE) drew a sellout of 80,355 when SummerSlam was hosted at Wembley Stadium. In the main event, English wrestler Davey Boy Smith won the Intercontinental Championship from Bret Hart. As of April 2023, WWE considers this to be their seventh largest live gate in history behind only WrestleMania 32 (2016), which drew a reported 101,763, WrestleMania III (1987), which drew a reported 93,173, WrestleMania 35, which drew 82,265, WrestleMania 39 (2023) Night 2 and Night 1, which drew 81,395 and 80,497, respectively, and WrestleMania 29 (2013), which drew 80,676 fans.

==Music==
The stadium became a musical venue in August 1972 with The London Rock and Roll Show, an all star concert. It later played host to a number of concerts and events, most notably the British leg of Live Aid, which featured such acts as David Bowie, Queen, Paul McCartney, Elton John, Status Quo, the Who, Dire Straits and U2, held at the stadium on 13 July 1985. Phil Collins performed at Wembley, then boarded a helicopter to London Heathrow Airport and took a British Airways Concorde to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to perform at the American segment of Live Aid at JFK Stadium on the same day.

Other charity concerts which took place in the stadium were the Human Rights Now! concert, The Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute Concert, Nelson Mandela: An International Tribute for a Free South Africa Concert, The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert for AIDS Awareness and the NetAid charity concert.

Acts who played at Wembley Stadium include:

* Michael Jackson performed 15 times at this location, the most by any artist in the history of Wembley stadium. During Michael Jackson&#x27;s Bad World Tour in 1988, he was given a special award by Wembley Stadium Officials for breaking a Guinness World Record with a combined total of 504,000 people attending the seven sold-out Wembley shows. The concert on 16 July 1988 was attended by Diana, Princess of Wales and Prince Charles (now King Charles III), and a DVD of this concert (&quot;Live at Wembley July 16, 1988&quot;) was released on 18 September 2012.

The Tunnel of Love Express Tour date is the biggest crowd for a concert at Wembley: 80,000 people. Springsteen was supposed to play two shows at Wembley but a scheduled Mike Tyson Boxing fight made that impossible as Wembley only took a certain amount of dates a year for football, concerts and sports. He also performed once in 2013 and once in 2016 at Wembley Stadium.
* U2 performed 9 times between 1985 and 1997 including four nights on the 4th (European) leg of their &quot;Zooropa&quot; tour on 11–12 and 20–21 August 1993.

==In popular culture==
===Literature===
Cecil Freeman Gregg&#x27;s crime novel &quot;Tragedy at Wembley&quot; (Methuen, 1936) sees his detective character Inspector Cuthbert Higgins investigate a murder at the stadium.

===Cinema===
The 1948 Olympic Marathon and the 1923 Stadium feature in the South Korean war film &quot;My Way&quot; (2011), though the marathon is clearly filmed in Riga, rather than London, and the stadium standing in for Wembley has an anachronistic electronic scoreboard.

The stadium also features in the 2001 mockumentary film &quot;Mike Bassett: England Manager&quot;.

In the 2018 Queen biopic &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; the stadium was digitally recreated for the Live Aid scene.

===Television===
John Betjeman is shown standing in the Stadium in his 1973 BBC film &quot;Metroland&quot;, though, as John Bale has pointed out in &quot;Anti-Sport Sentiments in Literature: Batting for the Opposition&quot; (Routledge, 2007), he shows no real interest in Wembley&#x27;s sporting connections, either here or elsewhere.

In Nigel Kneale&#x27;s 1979 &quot;Quatermass&quot;, in which ancient stone circles turn out to be locations designed by aliens to harvest young humans, the Stadium is said to have been built on the site of a stone circle (&quot;the Sacred Turf they call it&quot;, says Professor Quatermass, &quot;I wonder what&#x27;s underneath?&quot;)

===Urban myth===
There is a persistent myth that a small locomotive met with a mishap when Watkin&#x27;s Folly was being demolished, or the Empire Stadium built, and was buried under what became the &quot;sacred turf&quot; (though in some versions it is a carriage filled with rubble). When the stadium was rebuilt no locomotive or carriage (or stone circle...) was found, though the foundations of Watkin&#x27;s tower were.

<text>Thomas Hearns (born October 18, 1958) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1977 to 2006. Nicknamed the &quot;[[Detroit|Motor City]] Cobra&quot;, and more famously &quot;the Hitman&quot;, Hearns&#x27;s tall, slender build and long arms and shoulders allowed him to move up over fifty pounds (22.7kg) in his career and become the first boxer in history to win world titles in five weight divisions: welterweight, light middleweight, middleweight, super middleweight and light heavyweight.

Hearns was named Fighter of the Year by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine and the Boxing Writers Association of America in 1980 and 1984; the latter following his knockout of Roberto Durán. Hearns was known as a devastating puncher throughout his career, even at cruiserweight, despite having climbed up five weight classes. He is ranked number 18 on &quot;The Ring&quot;&#x27;s list of 100 greatest punchers of all time. He currently ranks #78 in BoxRec ranking of the greatest pound for pound boxers of all time. On June 10, 2012, Hearns was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Hearns was born in Grand Junction, Tennessee, on October 18, 1958, the youngest of three children in his mother&#x27;s first marriage. With her second marriage, six children joined the first three. On her own, Mrs. Hearns raised Tommy and his siblings in Grand Junction until Tommy was five years old; then the family moved to Detroit, Michigan. Hearns had an amateur record of 155–8. In 1977, he won the National Amateur Athletic Union Light Welterweight Championship, defeating Bobby Joe Young of Steubenville, Ohio, in the finals. He also won the 1977 National Golden Gloves Light Welterweight Championship.

==Professional career==

Hearns began his professional boxing career in Detroit, Michigan, under the tutelage of Emanuel Steward in 1977. Steward had changed Hearns from a light hitting amateur boxer to one of the most devastating punchers in boxing history.

He won six major world titles in five weight classes during his pro career, defeating future boxing hall of famers such as José &quot;Pipino&quot; Cuevas, Wilfred Benítez, Virgil Hill and Roberto Durán. In addition, he won the IBO title at Cruiserweight.

Hearns started his career by knocking out his first 17 opponents. In 1980, Hearns carried his 28–0 record into a world title match against Mexico&#x27;s Cuevas. Hearns ended Cuevas&#x27;s 4-year reign by beating him by TKO in the second round. Hearns was voted &quot;Fighter of the Year&quot; by Ring Magazine in 1980.

===Hearns vs. Leonard===
In 1981, Hearns the WBA Champion, with a 32–0 record (30 KOs), fought WBC Champion Sugar Ray Leonard (30–1) to unify the World Welterweight Championship in a bout dubbed &quot;The Showdown&quot;. In this fight, Hearns suffered his first professional defeat when Leonard stopped him in the 14th round. In the 13th round, Leonard, behind on points on all 3 judges scorecards, needed a knockout to win. He came on strong and put Hearns through the ropes at the end of the round. Hearns was dazed, totally out of gas and received a count but was saved by the bell. Leonard, with his left eye shut and time running out, resumed his attack in the 14th. Hearns started the round boxing and moving, but after staggering Hearns with an overhand right, Leonard pinned Hearns against the ropes. After another combination to the body and head, referee Davey Pearl stopped the fight. Hearns and Leonard banked a combined 17 million dollars for the fight, making it the largest purse in sports history at the time. The following year, Leonard retired due to a detached retina, and there would be no rematch until 1989.

===Light Middleweight Champion===

Hearns moved up in weight and won the WBC Super Welterweight (154 lb) title from boxing legend and three-time world champion Wilfred Benítez (44–1–1) in New Orleans in December 1982, and defended that title against European Champion Luigi Minchillo (42–1) (W 12), Roberto Durán (TKO 2), no.1 contender Fred Hutchings (29–1) (KO 3) and #1 contender Mark Medal (26–2) (TKO 8). During his reign at this weight, the 2 round destruction of Roberto Durán, in which he became the first boxer to KO Durán, is seen as his pinnacle achievement, earning him his second Ring Magazine &quot;Fighter of the Year&quot; award in 1984.

===Hagler vs Hearns===

While remaining super-welterweight (light-middleweight) champion, Hearns ventured into the middleweight division to challenge undisputed middleweight champion Marvin Hagler in 1985. Billed &quot;The Fight&quot; (later known as &quot;The War&quot;), this bout has often been labeled as the three greatest rounds in boxing history. The battle elevated both fighters to superstar status. Hearns was able to stun Hagler soon after the opening bell, but he subsequently broke his right hand in the first round. He did, however, manage to open a deep cut on Hagler&#x27;s forehead that caused referee Richard Steele to call a time out; the ring doctor examined the cut over Hagler&#x27;s right eye and said, &quot;let him go.&quot; The fight was allowed to continue at this point, with the ringside commentators remarking on the fact that, &quot;the last thing Hagler wants or needs is for this fight to be stopped on a cut.&quot; The battle did go back and forth some, but Hearns was unable to capitalize on his early successes against Hagler. As a result of breaking his right hand, Hearns began to use lateral movement and a good jab to keep Hagler at bay as best he could. This tactic worked fairly well, but in the third round Hagler staggered Hearns and managed to catch him against the ropes, where a crushing right hand by Hagler knocked Hearns down. Hearns beat the count but was clearly unable to continue and the referee decided to stop the fight. Despite the loss, Hearns garnered a tremendous amount of respect from fans and boxing aficionados alike. Considering the popularity of the fight and the level of competition, a rematch seemed to be a foregone conclusion and was highly anticipated, but it never took place.

===Comeback===

Hearns quickly made amends by dispatching undefeated rising star James &quot;Black Gold&quot; Shuler with a devastating first-round knockout in 1986. One week after the fight, Shuler was killed in a motorcycle accident. Hearns presented the NABF championship belt to Shuler&#x27;s family at his funeral, saying he deserved to keep the belt as he had held it longer than Hearns.

In March 1987, Hearns scored six knockdowns of Dennis Andries to win the WBC light-heavyweight title with a tenth round stoppage at Cobo Hall, Detroit, Michigan. Later that year, his four-round destruction of Juan Roldán (63–2) to claim the vacant WBC middleweight title made Hearns a four-weight world champion.

In a huge upset, Hearns lost his WBC middleweight title to Iran Barkley via a third-round TKO in June 1988 in a bout Ring Magazine named &quot;1988 Upset of the Year&quot;. In November that year, Hearns returned to win another world title, defeating James Kinchen (44–3) via a majority decision to win the inaugural WBO super-middleweight title. Hearns became the first boxer to win a world title in five weight divisions.

===Rematch with Leonard===

Hearns had to wait until 1989 for a rematch with Sugar Ray Leonard, this time for Leonard&#x27;s WBC super-middleweight title and Hearns&#x27;s WBO title. This was Hearns&#x27;s sixth Superfight, a fight which much of the public believed Hearns won, flooring Leonard in both the 3rd and 11th rounds. However, the judges scored the fight a controversial draw.

===Later career===

Hearns had one last great performance in 1991, as he challenged the undefeated WBA light-heavyweight champion Virgil Hill. In Hill&#x27;s eleventh defense of the title, Hearns returned to his amateur roots and outboxed the champion to win a convincing decision and add a sixth world title to his illustrious career. On March 20, 1992, Hearns lost this title on a split decision to old foe Iran Barkley but continued to compete and won his next 8 bouts.

On June 23, 1997, Hearns appeared on a WWF telecast, performing in a storyline where he was taunted and challenged by professional wrestler Bret &quot;Hitman&quot; Hart, who claimed that Hearns stole the &quot;Hitman&quot; nickname. Hearns ended up attacking Jim Neidhart and knocking him down with a series of punches before officials entered the ring and broke up the confrontation.

On November 6, 1998, Hearns had a boxing fight which featured a rare, double knockdown. In it, Hearns and opponent Jay Snyder landed punches simultaneously during the very first round, Hearns a devastating right hand to Snyder&#x27;s chin and Snyder a left jab to Hearns&#x27;s chin. Hearns was able to get up before the referee&#x27;s count reached ten seconds; Snyder was not and Hearns won by first-round knockout.

On April 10, 1999, Hearns travelled to England and beat Nate Miller by unanimous decision to win the IBO cruiserweight title. In his next fight in April 2000 he lost the title to Uriah Grant. The first round was competitive, with Hearns appearing hurt by a solid right to the jaw. Both fighters traded blows in the second round until Hearns appeared to injure his right ankle. He was forced to retire injured at the end of the round. The crowd booed and Hearns took the microphone and promised his fans that he would be back. Hearns fought twice more, winning both fights by TKO. His final fight was on 4 February 2006 against Shannon Landberg.

==Personal life==

Hearns&#x27;s family is a fixture on the Detroit sports scene. His mother, Lois Hearns, is a fight promoter. Their company, Hearns Entertainment, has promoted many cards, including the Mike Tyson–Andrew Golota bout in 2000. His son Ronald Hearns is also a boxer, and he fought on the undercard of his father&#x27;s last couple of fights. Hearns lives in Southfield, Michigan (a suburb of Detroit). Hearns serves as a Reserve Police Officer with the Detroit Police Department.

Due to personal financial issues, Hearns was forced to auction off his possessions at The Auction Block of Detroit, Michigan, on April 3, 2010. Items included were a 1957 Chevy, 47&#x27; Fountain boat, and a slew of collectible memorabilia. His debt to the IRS was $250,000. He took responsibility for repaying the entire debt, which he said was accrued from being overly generous toward his large extended family.

In 2012, Hearns was ticketed for parking in the middle of the road. He subsequently paid the ticket. His ticketing was featured in &quot;Parking Wars&quot;.

<text>Prospero ( ) is a fictional character and the protagonist of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;.

== Character ==
Twelve years before the play begins, Prospero is usurped from his position as the rightful Duke of Milan by his brother Antonio, who puts Prospero and his three-year-old daughter Miranda to sea on a &quot;rotten carcass&quot; of a boat to die. Prospero and Miranda survived and found exile on a small island inhabited mostly by spirits. Prospero learned sorcery from books, and uses it to protect Miranda.

Before the play begins, Prospero freed the magical spirit Ariel from entrapment within &quot;a cloven pine&quot;. Ariel is beholden to Prospero after he is freed from his imprisonment inside the pine tree. Prospero then takes Ariel as a slave. Prospero&#x27;s sorcery is sufficiently powerful to control Ariel and other spirits, as well as to alter weather and even raise the dead: &quot;Graves at my command have waked their sleepers, oped, and let &#x27;em forth, by my so potent Art.&quot; - Act V, scene 1.

On the island, Prospero becomes master of the monster Caliban, the son of a malevolent witch named Sycorax, and forces Caliban into submission by punishing him with magic if he does not obey.

=== Prospero&#x27;s speech ===
&quot;The Tempest&quot; is believed to be the last play Shakespeare wrote alone. In this play there are two candidate soliloquies by Prospero which critics have taken to be Shakespeare&#x27;s own &quot;retirement speech&quot;.

One speech is the &quot;Cloud-capp&#x27;d towers...&quot;.

&lt;poem&gt;
 Our revels now are ended: These our actors—,
 As I foretold you—, were all spirits and
 Are melted into air, into thin air;
 And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
 The cloud-capp&#x27;d towers, the gorgeous palaces,
 The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
 Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve
 And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
 Leave not a rack behind: we are such stuff
 As dreams are made on, and our little life
 Is rounded with a sleep. — &quot;The Tempest&quot;, Act 4, Scene 1
&lt;/poem&gt;

The final soliloquy and epilogue is the other candidate.

&lt;poem&gt;
 Now my charms are all o&#x27;erthrown,
 And what strength I have&#x27;s mine own,
 Which is most faint: now, &#x27;tis true,
 I must be here confined by you,
 Or sent to Naples. Let me not,
 Since I have my dukedom got
 And pardon&#x27;d the deceiver, dwell
 In this bare island by your spell;
 But release me from my bands
 With the help of your good hands:
 Gentle breath of yours my sails
 Must fill, or else my project fails,
 Which was to please. Now I want
 Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,
 And my ending is despair,
 Unless I be relieved by prayer,
 Which pierces so that it assaults
 Mercy itself and frees all faults.
 As you from crimes would pardon&#x27;d be,
 Let your indulgence set me free.
&lt;/poem&gt;

=== Audio ===
Audio portrayals of Prospero include:
== In popular culture ==
* In the comic book series &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; by Alan Moore and Kevin O&#x27;Neill, Prospero appears as a founding member of the first such grouping in 1610, alongside his familiars Caliban and Ariel.
* Paul Prospero, the protagonist of &quot;The Vanishing of Ethan Carter&quot; (2014), is named after Prospero.
* In John Bellairs&#x27;s novel &quot;The Face in the Frost&quot; (1969), one of the protagonists is a wizard named Prospero (&quot;and not the one you&#x27;re thinking of&quot;) .
* In Warhammer: 40,000 and further fleshed out in &quot;The Horus Heresy&quot; series, several books take place on a planet called Prospero, home of Magnus the Red and his Thousand Sons Space Marine legion. The citizens of the planet are versed in sorcery and psychic powers, earning them the suspicion and ire of the rest of the Imperium of Man.
* &quot;Melon Cauliflower&quot;, by New Zealand playwright Tom McCrory, is about a man Prospero, in his late sixties, who struggles to come to terms with the death of his wife and has mistreated his daughter Miranda.
* &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot;, by Edgar Allan Poe, is set at the manor of a Prince Prospero
* In the television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; by Gene Roddenberry and CBS / Paramount Pictures, Prospero appears briefly played by Lt. Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner) during the beginning of Season 7 Episode 23 entitled &quot;Emergence&quot;. He recites some lines of Prospero&#x27;s speech before asking Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) to provide some insight into the character of Prospero and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot; in general.

<doc id="143676" wikidata="Q628643" url="?curid=143676" title="IBM 650">
<text>The IBM 650 Magnetic Drum Data-Processing Machine is an early digital computer produced by IBM in the mid-1950s. It was the first mass-produced computer in the world. Almost 2,000 systems were produced, the last in 1962, and it was the first computer to make a meaningful profit. The first one was installed in late 1954 and it was the most popular computer of the 1950s.

The 650 was offered to business, scientific and engineering users as a slower and less expensive alternative to the IBM 701 and IBM 702 computers, which were for scientific and business purposes respectively. It was also marketed to users of punched card machines who were upgrading from calculating punches, such as the IBM 604, to computers.

Because of its relatively low cost and ease of programming, the 650 was used to pioneer a wide variety of applications, from modeling submarine crew performance to teaching high school and college students computer programming. The IBM 650 became highly popular in universities, where a generation of students first learned programming.

It was announced in 1953 and in 1956 enhanced as the IBM 650 RAMAC with the addition of up to four disk storage units. The purchase price for the bare IBM 650 console, without the reader punch unit, was $150,000 in 1959, or roughly $1,500,000 as of 2023. Support for the 650 and its component units was withdrawn in 1969.

The 650 was a two-address, bi-quinary coded decimal computer (both data and addresses were decimal), with memory on a rotating magnetic drum. Character support was provided by the input/output units converting punched card alphabetical and special character encodings to/from a two-digit decimal code.

The 650 was clocked at a frequency of 125 kHz. It could add or subtract in 1.63 milliseconds, multiply in 12.96 ms, and divide in 16.90 ms. The average speed of the 650 was estimated to be around 27.6 ms per instruction, or roughly 40 instructions per second.

Donald Knuth&#x27;s series of books &quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot; is famously dedicated to a 650.

==History==
The first 650 was installed on December 8, 1954 in the controller&#x27;s department of the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company in Boston.

The IBM 7070 (signed 10-digit decimal words), announced 1958, was expected to be a &quot;common successor to at least the 650 and the [IBM] 705&quot;. The IBM 1620 (variable-length decimal), introduced in 1959, addressed the lower end of the market. The UNIVAC Solid State (a two-address computer, signed 10-digit decimal words) was announced by Sperry Rand in December 1958 as a response to the 650. None of these had an instruction set that was compatible with the 650.

==Hardware==
The basic 650 system consisted of three units:

* IBM 650 Console Unit housed the magnetic drum storage, arithmetical device (using vacuum tubes) and the operator&#x27;s console.
* IBM 655 Power Unit
* IBM 533 or IBM 537 Card Read Punch Unit The IBM 533 had separate feeds for reading and punching; the IBM 537 had one feed, thus could read and then punch into the same card.
Weight: .

Optional units:

* IBM 46 Tape To Card Punch, Model 3
* IBM 47 Tape To Card Printing Punch, Model 3
* IBM 355 Disk Storage Unit Systems with a disk unit were known as &quot;IBM 650 RAMAC Data Processing Systems&quot;
* IBM 407 Accounting Machine
* IBM 543 Card Reader Unit
* IBM 544 Card Punch Unit
* IBM 652 Control Unit (magnetic tape, disk)
* IBM 653 Storage Unit (magnetic tape, disk, core storage, index registers, floating-point arithmetic)
* IBM 654 Auxiliary Alphabetic Unit
* IBM 727 Magnetic Tape Unit
* IBM 838 Inquiry Station

===Main memory===
Rotating drum memory provided 1,000, 2,000, or 4,000 words of memory at addresses 0000 to 0999, 1999, or 3999 respectively. Each word had 10 bi-quinary coded decimal digits, representing a signed 10-digit number or five characters. (Counting a bi-quinary coded digit as seven bits, 4000 words would be equivalent to 35 kilobytes.) Words on the drums were organized in bands around the drum, fifty words per band, and 20, 40, or 80 bands for the respective models. A word could be accessed when its location on the drum surface passed under the read/write heads during rotation (rotating at 12,500 rpm, the non-optimized average access time was 2.5 ms). Because of this timing, the second address in each instruction was the address of the next instruction. Programs could then be optimized by placing instructions at addresses that would be immediately accessible when execution of the previous instruction was completed. IBM provided a form with ten columns and 200 rows to allow programmers to keep track of where they put instructions and data. Later an assembler, SOAP (Symbolic Optimal Assembly Program), was provided that performed rough optimization.

The LGP-30, Bendix G-15 and IBM 305 RAMAC computers used vacuum tubes and drum memory too, but they were quite different from the IBM 650.

Instructions read from the drum went to a &quot;program register&quot; (in current terminology, an instruction register). Data read from the drum went through a 10-digit &quot;distributor.&quot; The 650 had a 20-digit &quot;accumulator&quot;, divided into 10-digit lower and upper accumulators with a common sign. Arithmetic was performed by a one-digit adder. The console (10 digit switches, one sign switch, and 10 bi-quinary display lights), distributor, lower and upper accumulators were all addressable; 8000, 8001, 8002, 8003 respectively.

===IBM 653 Storage Unit===
The optional IBM 653 Storage Unit, was introduced on May 3, 1955, ultimately providing up to five features:

* Magnetic tape controller (for IBM 727 Magnetic Tape units) (10 extra operation codes)
* Disk storage controller (1956 enhancement for then new IBM 355 Disk Storage Unit) (five extra operation codes)
* Sixty 10-digit words of magnetic core memory at addresses 9000 to 9059. This small &quot;fast memory&quot; had an access time of 96μs, a 26-fold improvement relative to the rotating drum. This feature added five operation codes and was needed as a buffer for tape and disk I/O. The 60 words could also be used by programs to speed up inner loops and table lookups.
* Three four-digit index registers at addresses 8005 to 8007; drum addresses were indexed by adding 2000, 4000 or 6000 to them, core addresses were indexed by adding 0200, 0400 or 0600 to them. If the system had the 4000 word drum then indexing was by adding 4000 to the first address for index register A, adding 4000 to the second address for index register B, and by adding 4000 to each of the two addresses for index register C (the indexing for 4000-word systems only applied to the first address). The 4000-word systems required transistorized read/write circuitry for the drum memory and were available before 1963. (18 extra operation codes)
* Floating point – arithmetic instructions supported an eight-digit mantissa and two-digit characteristic (offset exponent) – MMMMMMMMCC, providing a range of ±0.00000001E-50 to ±0.99999999E+49. (seven extra operation codes)

==Instruction set==
The 650 instructions consisted of a two-digit operation code, a four-digit data address and the four-digit address of the next instruction. The sign was ignored on the basic machine, but was used on machines with optional features. The base machine had 44 operation codes. Additional operation codes were provided for options, such as floating point, core storage, index registers and additional I/O devices. With all options installed, there were 97 operation codes.

The Table lookup (TLU) instruction could high-equal compare a referenced 10-digit word with 48 consecutive words on the same drum band in one 5ms revolution and then switch to the next band in time for the next 48 words. This feat was about one-third the speed of a one-thousand times faster binary machine in 1963 (1,500 microseconds on the IBM 7040 to 5,000 microseconds on the 650) for looking up 46 entries as long as both were programmed in assembler. There was an optional Table lookup Equal instruction, with the same performance.

The Read (RD) instruction read an 80-column card of numeric data into ten memory words; the distribution of digits to words determined by the card reader&#x27;s control panel wiring. When used with the 533 Reader Punch unit&#x27;s Alphabetic device, a combination of numeric and alphanumeric columns (maximum of 30 alphanumeric columns) could be read. An expansion feature allowed more alphanumeric columns but certainly not over 50, as only ten words (five characters per word) were stored on the drum by a card read operation.

The base machine operation codes were:


Notes:

The IBM 653 options could implement additional instruction codes.

==Sample program==

This one-card program, taken from the &quot;650 Programming Bulletin 5, IBM, 1956, 22-6314-0&quot;, will set most of the drum storage to minus zeros. The program includes examples of instructions being executed from the console switches and from an accumulator.

To begin, a load card is keypunched with 80 consecutive digits (the second column below) so that, when read, drum locations 0001 through 0008 contents will be as shown.

 0001 0000010000
 0002 0000000000-
 0003 1000018003
 0004 6100080007
 0005 2400008003
 0006 0100008000
 0007 6900060005
 0008 2019990003

The console digit switches (address 8000) are manually set to a Read instruction with data address 0004.

 loc- op|data|next
 ation |addr|instruction
 | |addr

 8000 RD 70 0004 xxxx Read load card into first band read area

Each drum band has a read area; these read areas are in locations 0001-0010, 0051-0060, 0101-0110 and so on. Any address in a band can be used to identify that band for a read instruction; the address 0004 identifies the first band. Execution begins then, from the console with the reading of the eight words on the load card into locations 0001-0008 of the first memory band. In the case of reading a load card, the &quot;next instruction address&quot; is taken from the data address field, not the next instruction address field (shown above as xxxx). Thus execution continues at 0004

 0004 RSU 61 0008 0007 Reset entire accumulator, subtract into upper (8003) the value 2019990003
 0007 LD 69 0006 0005 Load distributor with 0100008000
 0005 STD 24 0000 8003 Store distributor in location 0000, next instruction is in 8003 (the upper accumulator)
 Note: the moving of data or instructions from one drum location to another
 requires two instructions: LD, STD.

Now a two-instruction loop executes:

 8003 STL 20 1999 0003 Store lower accumulator (that accumulator was reset to 0- by the RSU instruction above)
 The &quot;1999&quot; data address is decremented, below, on each iteration.
 This instruction was placed in the upper accumulator by the RSU instruction above.
 Note: this instruction, now in the upper accumulator, will be decremented and then
 executed again while still in the accumulator.

 0003 AU 10 0001 8003 Decrement data address of the instruction in the accumulator by 1
 (by adding 10000 to a negative number)

The STL&#x27;s data address will, eventually, be decremented to 0003, and the AU ... instruction at 0003 will be overwritten with zeros. When that occurs (the STL&#x27;s next instruction address remains 0003) execution continues as follows:

 0003 NOOP 00 0000 0000 No-operation instruction, next instruction address is 0000
 0000 HALT 01 0000 8000 Halt, next instruction address is the console
 (this Halt instruction was stored in 0000 by the STD instruction above)

==Software==

The 650 instruction set is simple enough that small programs could be written in machine language and this was common for student exercises. There was a single-instruction-per-card format that could be loaded directly into the machine and executed. 

Machine language was awkward for large programs and, over time, a variety of programming languages and tools were 
written for the IBM 650. These included:

; Assemblers
*Symbolic Optimal Assembly Program (SOAP) — An assembler
*Technical Assembly System (TASS) — A macro assembler.

; Interpretive systems
* An Interpretive application virtual machine package originally published as &quot;Complete Floating Decimal Interpretive System for the IBM 650 Magnetic Drum Calculator&quot;. This was known by several names:
** the Wolontis–Bell Labs Interpreter, the Bell System, the Bell interpreter, the Bell interpretive system, or BLIS — the Bell Lab Interpretive System
** L1 and (later) L2 – known outside Bell Labs as &quot;Bell 1&quot; and &quot;Bell 2&quot;, among other names (see above)
*Synthetic Programming System for Commercial Applications 

; Algebraic languages / compilers
* Internal Translator (IT) — A compiler
* Revised Unified New Compiler IT Basic Language Extended (RUNCIBLE) — An extension of IT at Case
*FOR TRANSIT — A version of Fortran which compiled to IT which in turn was compiled to SOAP
*FORTRAN

*GATE — A simple compiler with one character variable names
*IPL — The first list processing language. The best-known version was IPL-V.
*SPACE (Simplified Programming Anyone Can Enjoy) — A business-oriented two-step compiler through SOAP

<text>Silent Witness is a British crime drama television series produced by the BBC that focuses on a team of forensic pathology experts and their investigations into various crimes. The series was created by Nigel McCrery, a former murder squad detective based in Nottingham. Since its initial release in 1996, 28 series of &quot;Silent Witness&quot; have been broadcast.

Amanda Burton starred as primary character Dr. Sam Ryan before leaving the show during the eighth series. Since her departure, the series has featured an ensemble cast, which initially consisted of William Gaminara, Tom Ward and Emilia Fox and later on David Caves, Liz Carr and Richard Lintern alongside Emilia Fox. At the end of series 23, Carr and Lintern departed.

The programme is broadcast in more than 235 territories, including ABC in Australia, Showcase and the Knowledge Network in Canada, KRO in the Netherlands, TV One and Prime in New Zealand, BBC First in South Africa and BBC America in the United States. &quot;Silent Witness&quot; continues to achieve good audience ratings in the UK.

==Background==
The main character in the original series was based on Professor Helen Whitwell, a forensic pathologist based in Sheffield, whom McCrery had known while serving as a police officer. The programme followed the activities of pathologist Sam Ryan, played by Amanda Burton, until she departed early in the eighth series.

There was a succession of regular supporting characters, changing almost every series, but Dr Leo Dalton (William Gaminara) and Dr Harry Cunningham (Tom Ward), who were introduced in the sixth series, continued as lead characters following Ryan&#x27;s departure, with Dalton replacing her as professor.

A new character, Dr Nikki Alexander (Emilia Fox), was introduced in mid-series eight, based on Dr Brooke Magnanti, a forensic scientist based in Sheffield. While working as a forensic anthropologist, she appropriates facilities and software in the pathology department to analyse an Iron Age find, with the belated, bemused and begrudging approval of Dalton. Dr Alexander is able to assist in a set of cases being investigated by the team, because it transpires that she has &quot;worked in forensic pathology in Johannesburg for six months&quot; and is certified by the Home Office to practice. She eventually overcomes Leo&#x27;s reluctance and, with Harry&#x27;s support, is offered and accepts a position on the team.

Before the 16th series begins, Harry has left to accept a position in New York City. He is succeeded by forensics expert Jack Hodgson (David Caves) and his assistant Clarissa Mullery (Liz Carr). At the climax of the 16th series, Leo is killed in an explosion. His replacement, Dr Thomas Chamberlain (Richard Lintern), is introduced at the start of the 17th series.

Although the show focuses heavily on areas of pathology, the police also have a presence in each case. During later series of the show, detectives and investigators tend to differ from episode to episode, with guest artists appearing in these roles. However, during the early years of the show several characters appeared regularly to investigate each case.

The first three series are set in Cambridge. The setting changed to London from the start of the fourth series, following Sam as she took up an academic position in the Lyell Centre, the Pathology Department of UCL. The programme remained in an academic setting until the end of series 16 when the Lyell appeared to have become separated from the university and operated as a stand-alone institution.

Each series is typically made up of a series of two-part stories. The first nine series generally featured eight episodes (four two-part stories), except that series 4 and 5 each featured just six episodes (three two-part stories); this was increased to ten episodes (five two-part stories) from the tenth series onwards, except series 12 and 15 which each featured 12 episodes (six two-part stories). The 25th series, broadcast in 2022, introduced a new format consisting of one story in six episodes, but the format reverted to five two-part stories from the 26th series onwards.

In 1998, the writer John Milne received an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for the second series episode &quot;Blood, Sweat and Tears&quot;. In the United States the series airs during &#x27;Mystery Monday&#x27; on BBC America.

==Music==
The theme music from series 2 onwards is entitled &quot;Silencium&quot; and is performed by John Harle. The arrangement, for chamber orchestra and soprano saxophone solo, was first performed publicly as part of the Canterbury Festival on 22 October 2011. The vocal section is performed by Sarah Leonard.

==Critical review==
An episode first broadcast in April 2012 attracted criticism for its violent and sadistic content. There were 632 complaints made about the fifteenth-series episode &quot;Redhill&quot;, written by Ed Whitmore, which included a scene depicting a sadistic sexual and murderous attack. The BBC was censured by the editorial committee of the BBC Trust, which said in its report:

The BBC had responded to the initial criticism of the episode by saying that it took its responsibility to its audience &quot;extremely seriously&quot; and always tried to &quot;strike the right balance between compelling drama without being unnecessarily graphic&quot;. It said that &quot;The final scene was not an attempt to gratuitously shock the audience;... We acknowledge that certain scenes may have been challenging, but we filmed and presented them in such a way as to make sure that although as a viewer the implication was there, it was never actually shown.&quot;

==Episodes==

==Characters==

===Overview===
===Main===
*Sam Ryan (Amanda Burton) – series 1–8, 25. Sam originally lived and worked in Cambridge, but moved to London at the end of series three after she was offered the job of professor at a university. Sam departed and returned home to Northern Ireland in the second episode of series eight, &quot;A Time To Heal&quot;, in which a member of her family became a suspect in a murder case. At the end of Series 24, in a brief mid-credits scene, she is shown phoning Nikki Alexander to ask for help. This leads into her reappearing in Series 25.
*Leo Dalton (William Gaminara) – series 6–16. Leo first appeared in the episode &quot;The Fall Out&quot;, where he was a doctor. However, he was promoted to professor after former professor Sam Ryan left. In the episode &quot;Ghosts&quot;, both his wife, Theresa, and his daughter, Cassie, are killed in a car accident. He began a relationship with fellow professor Janet Mander in &quot;Death&#x27;s Door&quot;, but ended their relationship in the episode &quot;Redhill&quot;. Leo often took a strong opinion on cases and became emotionally involved. He died in the series 16 finale &quot;Greater Love&quot;, when he sacrificed himself to save many others from a terrorist bomb explosion. He briefly appeared in a flashback in the last episode of series 20.
*Harry Cunningham (Tom Ward) – series 6–15. Harry started out life as a junior doctor, who worked as an apprentice to Sam and Leo. However, he soon qualified as a pathologist, and has worked on equal footing with the team for a number of years. Harry was single, and lived alone, but has had several romantic relationships, including an ongoing &#x27;will they-won&#x27;t they&#x27; relationship with his colleague Nikki. Harry left the team to accept a professorship in New York at the end of series 15. As this was decided after filming was completed, and the stories were reordered, with &quot;And Then I Fell in Love&quot; airing last, where it was originally scheduled as the second episode, his departure was never on screen.
*Nikki Alexander (Emilia Fox) – since series 8. Originally appearing in the episode &quot;Nowhere Fast&quot;, Nikki was originally assigned to the Lyell Centre to defuse the tension between Harry and Leo after Sam&#x27;s departure. However, Nikki soon became a permanent fixture within the team, and although she features more prominently in the series, holds a lower rank in pathology than Leo. Despite her native home being South Africa, Nikki regards the United Kingdom as her second home, as the reason for her departure from the country lies solely in the hands of her father, Victor, as explained in the episode &quot;Double Dare&quot;. Nikki often flirted with colleague Harry, and even invited him to stay at her house after his flat blew up in an explosion. Nikki and Harry were in an ongoing &#x27;will they-won&#x27;t they&#x27; relationship until he left in series 15. As well as this, she developed a close relationship with Leo and looked up to him as a father figure. As Leo and Harry gradually left, Nikki has since become the series&#x27; central character. She starts a relationship with Jack in series 27. They marry in series 28.
*Jack Hodgson (David Caves) – since series 16. Before his arrival at the Lyell Centre, Jack was a forensic scientist for the police, working on regular murder investigations. However, when he is called out to the scene of a man&#x27;s suspicious death in &quot;Change&quot;, both Nikki and Leo spot his potential, and looking for a senior colleague to replace Harry, decide to offer Jack a job as the centre&#x27;s forensic expert. Jack is close friends with colleague Clarissa Mullery, whom he invites to work with him at the Lyell Centre, much to Leo&#x27;s surprise. In his spare time, Jack is a cage fighter, and splits his home life between forensic research and training for his next fight. From series 27 he has a relationship with Nikki. They marry in series 28.
*Clarissa Mullery (Liz Carr) – series 16–23. Clarissa is Jack&#x27;s personal lab assistant, who first appears in the episode &quot;Change&quot;, when Jack invites her to work at the Lyell Centre with him, much to Leo&#x27;s surprise. She is disabled by an unspecified condition and uses an electric wheelchair. She has a very cheeky side, making a quip at Leo after he fails to recognise her when she first arrives. Clarissa had clearly worked for Jack for a long period of time before his appointment at the Lyell Centre, but the exact period of time is unknown.
*Thomas Chamberlain (Richard Lintern) – series 17–23. Thomas Chamberlain took over as head of the Lyell Centre from Leo who died at the end of series 16. He was an experienced forensic pathologist with a renowned reputation in toxicology and is described as charming, charismatic and socially shrewd. His first encounters with Jack, Nikki and Clarissa did not go well, but they gradually warmed to him. It is revealed in the last episode of his first series that his wife left him just before he started working at the Lyell Centre, taking their daughter with her. He died in the series 23 finale &quot;The Greater Good&quot; whilst investigating a nerve agent in the pathology suite of the Lyell Centre.
*Simone Tyler (Genesis Lynea) – series 24–25. Simone is a meticulous forensic ecologist, who makes the jump from the museum to the mortuary at the Lyell Centre. Simone leaves at the end of season 25 to look after her nieces in Trinidad after learning about her estranged sister&#x27;s death.

==Home media==
===Australia===
In Australia (Region 4), series 1 through 23 have been released on DVD through Roadshow Entertainment, starting with series 1 on 7 September 2006 through to series 21 on 28 May 2018. Universal then took over the releases beginning with series 22 on 20 November 2019, and have re-released some earlier seasons this time as individual seasons rather than 2 season editions. 
===United Kingdom===
As of February 2025, 28 series have been released on DVD. In addition, all episodes (barring two from series 1) from the first 27 series have been made available on the BBC iPlayer.

==Novels==
During the early years of the show, series creator McCrery wrote and published four tie-in novels relating to the series, following Sam Ryan (Amanda Burton), Trevor Stewart (William Armstrong) and Superintendent Tom Adams (John McGlynn), and brand new character DS Stanley Sharman, with Burton generally appearing on the front cover of each novel. A fifth novel, &quot;In Search of Evil&quot;, was due to be released in 2003, but its publication was cancelled.

<doc id="143681" wikidata="Q271439" url="?curid=143681" title="Elongation (astronomy)">
<text>In astronomy, a planet&#x27;s elongation is the angular separation between the Sun and the planet, with Earth as the reference point.

The greatest elongation is the maximum angular separation. Astronomical tables and websites, such as Heavens-Above, forecast when and where the planets reach their next maximum elongations.

Sometimes elongation may instead refer to the angular distance of the Moon relative Earth or the natural satellite of another planet from its central planet, for instance the angular distance of Io from Jupiter.

A quadrature occurs when the position of a body (moon or planet) is such that its elongation is 90° or 270°; i.e. the body-earth-sun angle is 90°.

==Of inferior planets==
The greatest elongation of a given inferior planet occurs when this planet&#x27;s position, in its orbital path around the Sun, is at tangent to the observer on Earth. Since an inferior planet is well within the area of Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun, observation of its elongation should not pose that much a challenge (compared to deep-sky objects, for example). When a planet is at its greatest elongation, it appears farthest from the Sun as viewed from Earth, so its apparition is also best at that point.

When an inferior planet is visible after sunset, it is near its greatest eastern elongation. When an inferior planet is visible before sunrise, it is near its greatest western elongation. The angle of the maximum elongation (east or west) for Mercury is between 18° and 28°, while that for Venus is between 45° and 47°. These values vary because the planetary orbits are elliptical rather than perfectly circular. Another factor contributing to this inconsistency is orbital inclination, in which each planet&#x27;s orbital plane is slightly tilted relative to a reference plane, like the ecliptic and invariable planes.

=== Greatest elongation period ===
Greatest elongations of a planet happen periodically, with a greatest eastern elongation followed by a greatest western elongation, and &quot;vice versa&quot;. The period depends on the relative angular velocity of Earth and the planet, as seen from the Sun. The time it takes to complete this period is the synodic period of the planet.

Let &quot;T&quot; be the period (for example the time between two greatest eastern elongations), &quot;ω&quot; be the relative angular velocity, &quot;ω&quot;e Earth&#x27;s angular velocity and &quot;ω&quot;p the planet&#x27;s angular velocity. Then

:formula_1

where &quot;T&quot;e and &quot;T&quot;p are Earth&#x27;s and the planet&#x27;s years (i.e. periods of revolution around the Sun, called sidereal periods).

For example, Venus&#x27;s year (sidereal period) is 225 days, and Earth&#x27;s is 365 days. Thus Venus&#x27;s synodic period, which gives the time between every two eastern greatest elongations, is 584 days; this also applies to the western counterparts.

These values are approximate, because (as mentioned above) the planets do not have perfectly circular, coplanar orbits. When a planet is closer to the Sun it moves faster than when it is further away, so exact determination of the date and time of greatest elongation requires a much more complicated analysis of orbital mechanics.

==Of superior planets==
Superior planets, dwarf planets and asteroids undergo a different cycle. After conjunction, such an object&#x27;s elongation continues to increase until it approaches a maximum value larger than 90° (impossible with inferior planets) which is known as &quot;opposition&quot; and can also be examined as a heliocentric conjunction with Earth. This is archetypally very near 180°. As seen by an observer on the superior planet at opposition, the Earth appears at conjunction with the Sun. Technically, the point of opposition can be different from the time and point of maximum elongation. Opposition is defined as the moment when the apparent ecliptic longitude of any such object versus the Sun (seen from earth) differs by (is) 180°; it thus ignores how much the object differs from the plane of the Earth&#x27;s orbit. For example, Pluto, whose orbit is highly inclined to the essentially matching plane of the planets, has maximum elongation much less than 180° at opposition. The six-word term &quot;maximum apparent elongation from the sun&quot; provides a fuller definition of elongation.

All superior planets are most conspicuous at their oppositions because they are near, or at, their closest to Earth and are also above the horizon all night. The variation in magnitude caused by changes in elongation are greater the closer the planet&#x27;s orbit is to the Earth&#x27;s. Mars&#x27; magnitude in particular changes with elongation: it can be as low as +1.8 when in conjunction near aphelion but at a rare favourable opposition it is as high as −2.9, which translates to seventy-five times brighter than its minimum brightness. As one moves further out, the difference in magnitude that correlates to the difference in elongation gradually falls. At opposition, the brightness of Jupiter from Earth ranges 3.3-fold; whereas that of Uranus – the most distant Solar System body visible to the naked eye – ranges by 1.7 times.

Since asteroids travel in an orbit not much larger than the Earth&#x27;s, their magnitude can vary greatly depending on elongation. More than a dozen objects in the asteroid belt can be seen with 10×50 binoculars at an average opposition, but of these only Ceres and Vesta are always above the binocular limit of +9.5 when the objects at their worst points in their orbital opposition (smallest elongations).

==Of moons of other planets==

Sometimes elongation may instead refer to the angular distance of a moon of another planet from its central planet, for instance the angular distance of Io from Jupiter. Here we can also talk about &quot;greatest eastern elongation&quot; and &quot;greatest western elongation&quot;. In the case of the moons of Uranus, studies often deal with &quot;greatest northern elongation&quot; and &quot;greatest southern elongation&quot; instead, due to the very high inclination of Uranus&#x27; axis of rotation.

<text>Sir Charles Barry (23 May 1795 – 12 May 1860) was a British architect, best known for his role in the rebuilding of the Palace of Westminster (also known as the Houses of Parliament) in London during the mid-19th century, but also responsible for numerous other buildings and gardens. He is known for his major contribution to the use of Italianate architecture in Britain, especially the use of the Palazzo as basis for the design of country houses, city mansions and public buildings. He also developed the Italian Renaissance garden style for the many gardens he designed around country houses.

== Background and training ==

Born on 23 May 1795 in Bridge Street, Westminster (opposite the future site of the Clock Tower of the Palace of Westminster), he was the fourth son of Walter Edward Barry (died 1805), a stationer, and Frances Barry (née Maybank; died 1798). He was baptised at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, into the Church of England, of which he was a lifelong member. His father remarried shortly after Frances died and Barry&#x27;s stepmother Sarah would bring him up. 

He was educated at private schools in Homerton and then Aspley Guise, before being apprenticed to Middleton &amp; Bailey, Lambeth architects and surveyors, at the age of 15. Barry exhibited drawings at the Royal Academy annually from 1812 to 1815. Upon the death of his father, Barry inherited a sum of money that allowed him, after coming of age, to undertake an extensive Grand Tour around the Mediterranean and Middle East, from 28 June 1817 to August 1820.

He visited France and, while in Paris, spent several days at the Musée du Louvre. In Rome, he sketched antiquities, sculptures and paintings at the Vatican Museums and other galleries, before carrying on to Naples, Pompeii, Bari and then Corfu. While in Italy, Barry met Charles Lock Eastlake, an architect, William Kinnaird and Francis Johnson (later a professor at Haileybury and Imperial Service College) and Thomas Leverton Donaldson. 

With these gentlemen he visited Greece, where their itinerary covered Athens, which they left on 25 June 1818, Mount Parnassus, Delphi, Aegina, then the Cyclades, including Delos, then Smyrna and Turkey, where Barry greatly admired the magnificence of Hagia Sophia. From Constantinople he visited the Troad, Assos, Pergamon and back to Smyrna. In Athens, he met David Baillie, who was taken with Barry&#x27;s sketches and offered to pay him £200 a year plus any expenses to accompany him to Egypt, Palestine and Syria in return for Barry&#x27;s drawings of the countries they visited. Middle East sites they visited included Dendera, the Temple of Edfu and Philae – it was at the last of these three that he met his future client, William John Bankes, on 13 January 1819 – then Thebes, Luxor and Karnak. Then, back to Cairo and Giza with its pyramids.

Continuing through the Middle East, the major sites and cities visited were Jaffa, the Dead Sea, Jerusalem, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, then Bethlehem, Baalbek, Jerash, Beirut, Damascus and Palmyra, then on to Homs. 

On 18 June 1819, Barry parted from Baillie at Tripoli, Lebanon. Over this time, Barry created more than 500 sketches. Barry then travelled on to Cyprus, Rhodes, Halicarnassus, Ephesus and Smyrna from where he sailed on 16 August 1819 for Malta.

Barry then sailed from Malta to Syracuse, Sicily, then Italy and back through France. His travels in Italy exposed him to Renaissance architecture and after arriving in Rome in January 1820, he met architect John Lewis Wolfe, who inspired Barry himself to become an architect. Their friendship continued until Barry died. The building that inspired Barry&#x27;s admiration for Italian architecture was the Palazzo Farnese. Over the following months, he and Wolfe together studied the architecture of Vicenza, Venice, Verona and Florence, where the Palazzo Strozzi greatly impressed him.

== Early career ==

While in Rome he had met Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne, through whom he met Henry Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland, and his wife, Elizabeth Fox, Baroness Holland. Their London home, Holland House, was the centre of the Whig Party. Barry remained a lifelong supporter of the Liberal Party, the successor to the Whig Party. Barry was invited to the gatherings at the house, and there met many of the prominent members of the group; this led to many of his subsequent commissions. Barry set up his home and office in Ely Place in 1821. In 1827 he moved to 27 Foley Place, then in 1842 he moved to 32 Great George Street and finally to The Elms, Clapham Common. Now 29 Clapham Common Northside, the Georgian house of five bays and three stories was designed by Samuel Pepys Cockerell as his own home.

Probably thanks to his fiancée&#x27;s friendship with John Soane, Barry was recommended to the Church Building Commissioners, and was able to obtain his first major commissions building churches for them. These were in the Gothic Revival architecture style, including two in Lancashire, St Matthew, Campfield, Manchester (1821–22), and All Saints&#x27; Church, Whitefield (or Stand) (1822–25). Barry designed three churches for the Commissioners in Islington: Holy Trinity, St John&#x27;s and St Paul&#x27;s, all in the Gothic style and built between 1826 and 1828.

Two further Gothic churches in Lancashire, not for the Commissioners followed in 1824: St Saviour&#x27;s Church, Ringley, partially rebuilt in 1851–54, and Barry&#x27;s neglected Welsh Baptist Chapel, on Upper Brook Street (1837–39) in Manchester (and owned by the City Council), long open to the elements and at serious risk after its roof was removed in late 2005, the building was converted to private apartments in 2014–17. His final church for the Commissioners&#x27; was the Gothic St Peter&#x27;s Church, Brighton (1824–28), which he won in a design competition on 4 August 1823 and was his first building to win acclaim.

The next church he designed was St Andrew&#x27;s Hove, East Sussex, in Waterloo Street, Brunswick, (1827–28); the plan of the building is in line with Georgian architecture, though stylistically the Italianate style was used, the only classical church Barry designed that was actually built. The Gothic Hurstpierpoint church (1843–45), with its tower and spire, unlike his earlier churches was much closer to the Cambridge Camden Society&#x27;s approach to church design. According to his son Alfred, Barry later disowned these early church designs of the 1820s and wished he could destroy them.
His first major civil commission came when he won a competition to design the new Royal Manchester Institution (1824–1835) for the promotion of literature, science and arts (now part of the Manchester Art Gallery), in Greek revival style, the only public building by Barry in that style. Also in north-west England, he designed Buile Hill House (1825) in Salford this is the only known house where Barry used Greek revival architecture. The Royal Sussex County Hospital was erected to Barry&#x27;s design (1828) in a very plain classical style.

Thomas Attree&#x27;s villa, Queen&#x27;s Park, Brighton, the only one to be built of a series of villas designed for the area by Barry and the Pepper Pot (1830), whose original function was a water tower for the development. In 1831, he entered the competition for the design of Birmingham Town Hall, the design was based on an Ancient Greek temple of the Doric order, but it failed to win the competition.

The marked preference for Italian architecture, which he acquired during his travels showed itself in various important undertakings of his earlier years, the first significant example being the Travellers Club, in Pall Mall, built in 1832, as with all his urban commissions in this style the design was astylar. He designed the Gothic King Edward&#x27;s School, New Street, Birmingham (1833–37), demolished 1936, it was during the erection of the school that Barry first met Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin, he helped Barry design the interiors of the building.

His last work in Manchester was the Italianate Manchester Athenaeum (1837–39), this is now part of Manchester Art Gallery. From 1835–37, he rebuilt Royal College of Surgeons of England, in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, Westminster, he preserved the Ionic portico from the earlier building (1806–13) designed by George Dance the Younger, the building has been further extended (1887–88) and (1937). In 1837, he won the competition to design the Reform Club, Pall Mall, London, which is one of his finest Italianate public buildings, notable for its double height central saloon with glazed roof. His favourite building in Rome, the Farnese Palace, influenced the design.

== Country house work ==

A major focus of his career was the remodelling of older country houses. His first major commission was the transformation of Henry Holland&#x27;s Trentham Hall in Staffordshire, between 1834 and 1840. It was remodelled in the Italianate style with a large tower (a feature Barry often included in his country houses). Barry also designed the Italianate gardens, with parterres and fountains. Largely demolished in 1912, only a small portion of the house, consisting of the porte-cochère with a curving corridor, and the stables, are still standing, although the gardens are undergoing a restoration. Additionally, the belvedere from the top of the tower survives as a folly at Sandon Hall.

Between 1834 and 1838, at Bowood House, Wiltshire, owned by Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne, Barry added the tower, made alterations to the gardens, and designed the Italianate entrance lodge. For the same client, he designed the Lansdowne Monument in 1845. Walton House in Walton-on-Thames followed in 1835–39. Again Barry used the Italianate style, with a three-storey tower over the entrance porte-cochère (which was demolished 1973). Then, from 1835 to 1838, he remodelled Sir Roger Pratt&#x27;s Kingston Lacy, with the exterior being re-clad in stone. The interiors were also Barry&#x27;s work.

Highclere Castle, Hampshire, with its large tower, was remodelled between about 1842 and 1850, in Elizabethan style, for Henry Herbert, 3rd Earl of Carnarvon. The building was completely altered externally, with the plain Georgian structure being virtually rebuilt. However, little of the interior is by Barry, because his patron died in 1849 and Thomas Allom completed the work in 1861. At Duncombe Park, Yorkshire, Barry designed new wings, which were added between in 1843 and 1846 in the English Baroque style of the main block. At Harewood House he remodelled the John Carr exterior between 1843 and 1850, adding an extra floor to the end pavilions, and replacing the portico on the south front with Corinthian pilasters. Some of the Robert Adam interiors were remodelled, with the dining room being entirely by Barry, and he created the formal terraces and parterres surrounding the house.

Between 1844 and 1848, Barry remodelled Dunrobin Castle, Sutherland, Scotland, in Scots Baronial Style, for George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland for whom he had remodelled Trentham Hall. Due to a fire in the early 20th century, little of Barry&#x27;s interiors survive at Dunrobin, but the gardens, with their fountains and parterres, are also by Barry. Canford Manor, Dorset, was extended in a Tudor Gothic style between 1848 and 1852, including a large entrance tower. The most unusual interior is the Nineveh porch, built to house Assyrian sculptures from the eponymous palace, decorated with Assyrian motifs.

James Paine&#x27;s Shrubland Park was remodelled between 1849 and 1854, including an Italianate tower and entrance porch, a lower hall with Corinthian columns and glass domes, and impressive formal gardens based on Italian Renaissance gardens. The gardens included a -high series of terraces linked by a grand flight of steps, with an open temple structure at the top. Originally there were cascades of water either side of the staircase. The main terrace is at the centre of a string of gardens nearly in length.

Between 1850 and 1852, Barry remodelled Gawthorpe Hall, an Elizabethan house situated south-east of the small town of Padiham, in the borough of Burnley, Lancashire. It was originally a pele tower, built in the 14th century as a defence against the invading Scots. Around 1600, a Jacobean mansion had been dovetailed around the pele, but today&#x27;s hall is re-design of the house, using the original Elizabethan style.

Barry&#x27;s last major remodelling work was Cliveden House, which had been the seat of the Earl of Orkney from 1696 till 1824. Barry&#x27;s remodelling was again on behalf of the 2nd Duke of Sutherland. After the previous building was burnt down (1850–51), Barry built a new central block in the Italianate Style, rising to three floors, the lowest of which have arch headed windows, and the upper two floors have giant Ionic pilasters. He also designed the parterres below the house. Little of Barry&#x27;s interior design survived later remodelling.

== Later urban work ==

Barry remodelled Trafalgar Square (1840–45) he designed the north terrace with the steps at either end, and the sloping walls on the east and west of the square, the two fountain basins are also to Barry&#x27;s design, although Edwin Lutyens re-designed the actual fountains (1939).

Barry was commissioned to design (1840–42) the facade of Pentonville prison, that was designed by Joshua Jebb, he added a stuccoed Italianate pilastered frontage to Caledonian Road. The (Old) Treasury (Now Cabinet Office) Whitehall by John Soane, built (1824–26) was virtually rebuilt by Barry (1844–47). It consists of 23 bays with a giant Corinthian order over a rusticated ground floor, the five bays at each end project slightly from the facade.

Bridgewater House, Westminster, London (1845–64) for Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere, in a grand Italianate style. The structure was complete by 1848, but interior decoration was only finished by 1864. The main (south) front is 144 feet long, of nine bays in more massive version of his earlier Reform Club, the garden (west) front is of seven bays. The interiors are intact apart from the north wing which was bombed in The Blitz. The main interior is the central Saloon, a roofed courtyard of two storeys, of three by five bays of arches on each floor, the walls are lined with scagliola, the coved ceiling is glazed and the centre has three glazed saucer domes. The decoration of the major rooms is not the work of Barry.

The last major commission of Barry&#x27;s was Halifax Town Hall (1859–62), in a North Italian Cinquecento style, and a grand tower with spire, the interior includes a central hall similar to that at Bridgewater House, the building was completed after Barry&#x27;s death by his son Edward Middleton Barry.

Completed after Barry&#x27;s death in 1863 was the classical, Guest Memorial Reading Room and Library in Dowlais, Wales.

The most significant of Barry&#x27;s designs that were not carried out included, his proposed Law Courts (1840–41), that if built would have covered Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields with a large Greek Revival building, this rectangular building would have been over three hundred by four hundred feet, in a Greek Doric style, there would have been octastyle porticoes in the middle of the shorter sides and hexastyle porticoes on the longer sides, leading to a large central hall that would have been surrounded by twelve court rooms that in turn were surrounded by the ancillary facilities. Later was his General Scheme of Metropolitan Improvements, that were exhibited in 1857. This comprehensive scheme was for the redevelopment of much of Whitehall, Horse Guards Parade, the embankment of the River Thames on both sides of the river in the areas to the north and south of the Palace of Westminster, this would eventual be partially realised as the Victoria Embankment and Albert Embankment, three new bridges across the Thames, a vast Hotel where Charing Cross railway station was later built, the enlargement of the National Gallery (Barry&#x27;s son Edward would later extend the Gallery) and new buildings around Trafalgar Square and along the new embankments and the recently created Victoria Street. There were also several new roads proposed on both sides of the Thames. The largest of the proposed buildings would have been even larger than the Palace of Westminster, this was the Government Offices, this vast building would have covered the area stretching from horse Guards Parade across Downing Street and the sites of the future Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the HM Treasury on Whitehall up to Parliament Square. It would have had a vast glass-roofed hall, 320 by 150 feet, at the centre of the building. The plan was to house all government departments apart from the Admiralty in the building. The building would have been in a Classical style incorporating Barry&#x27;s existing Treasury building.

== Houses of Parliament ==

Following the destruction by fire of the old Houses of Parliament on 16 October 1834, a competition was held to find a suitable design, for which there were 97 entries. Barry&#x27;s entry, number 64, for which Augustus Pugin helped prepare the competition drawings, won the commission in January 1836 to design the new Palace of Westminster. His collaboration with Pugin, who designed furniture, stained glass, sculpture, wallpaper, decorative floor tiles and mosaic work, was not renewed until June 1844, and then continued until Pugin&#x27;s mental breakdown and death in 1852. The Tudor Gothic architectural style was chosen to complement the Henry VII Lady Chapel opposite. The design had to incorporate those parts of the building that escaped destruction, most notably Westminster Hall, the adjoining double-storey cloisters of St Stephen&#x27;s court and the crypt of St Stephen&#x27;s Chapel. Barry&#x27;s design was parallel to the River Thames, but the surviving buildings were at a slight angle to the river, so Barry had to incorporate the awkwardly different axes into the design. Although the design included most of the elements of the finished building, including the two towers at either end of the building, it would undergo significant redesign. The winning design was only about in length, about two-thirds the size of the finished building. The central lobby and tower were later additions, as was the extensive royal suite at the southern end of the building. The amended design on which construction commenced was approximately the same size as the finished building, although both the Victoria Tower and Clock Tower were considerably taller in the finished building, and the Central Tower was not yet part of the design.

Before construction could commence, the site had to be embanked and cleared of the remains of the previous buildings, and various sewers needed to be diverted. On 1 September 1837, work started on building a long coffer-dam to enclose the building site along the river. The construction of the embankment started on New Year&#x27;s Day 1839. The first work consisted of the construction of a vast concrete raft to serve as the building&#x27;s foundation. After the space had been excavated by hand, of concrete were laid. The site of the Victoria Tower was found to consist of quicksand, necessitating the use of piles. The stone selected for the exterior of the building was quarried at Anston in Yorkshire, with the core of the walls being laid in brick. To make the building as fire-proof as possible, wood was only used decoratively, rather than structurally, and extensive use was made of cast iron. The roofs of the building consist of cast iron girders covered by sheets of iron, cast iron beams were also used as joists to support the floors and extensively in the internal structures of both the clock tower and Victoria tower.

Barry and his engineer Alfred Meeson were responsible for designing scaffolding, hoists and cranes used in the construction. One of their most innovative developments was the scaffolding used to construct the three main towers. For the central tower they designed an inner rotating scaffold, surrounded by timber centring to support the masonry vault of the Central Lobby, that spans , and an external timber tower. A portable steam engine was used to lift stone and brick to the upper parts of the tower. When it came to building the Victoria and Clock towers, it was decided to dispense with external scaffolding and lift building materials up through the towers by an internal scaffolding that travelled up the structure as it was built. The scaffold and cranes were powered by steam engines.

Work on the actual building began with the laying of a foundation stone on 27 April 1840 by Barry&#x27;s wife Sarah, near the north-east corner of the building. A major problem for Barry came with the appointment on 1 April 1840 of the ventilation expert Dr David Boswell Reid. Reid, whom Barry said was &quot;...not profess to be thoroughly acquainted with the practical details of building and machinery...&quot;, would make increasing demands that affected the building&#x27;s design, leading to delays in construction. By 1845, Barry was refusing to communicate with Reid except in writing. A direct result of Reid&#x27;s demands was the addition of the Central Tower, designed to act as a giant chimney to draw fresh air through the building.

The House of Lords was completed in April 1847 in the form of a double cube measuring . The House of Commons was finished in 1852, where later Barry would be created a Knight Bachelor. The Elizabeth Tower, which houses the great clock and bells including Big Ben, is tall and was completed in 1858. The Victoria Tower is tall and was completed in 1860. The iron flagpole on the Victoria Tower tapers from in diameter and the iron crown on top is in diameter and above ground. The central tower is high. The building is long, covers about of land, and has over 1000 rooms. The east Thames façade is in length. Pugin later dismissed the building, saying &quot;All Grecian, Sir, Tudor details on a classic body&quot;, the essentially symmetrical plan and river front being offensive to Pugin&#x27;s taste for medieval Gothic buildings.

The plan of the finished building is built around two major axes. At the southern end of Westminster Hall, St. Stephen&#x27;s porch was created as a major entrance to the building. This involved inserting a great arch with a grand staircase at the southern end of Westminster hall, which leads to the first floor where the major rooms are located. To the east of St. Stephens porch is St. Stephen&#x27;s Hall, built on the surviving undercroft of St. Stephen&#x27;s Chapel. To the east of this the octagonal Central Lobby (above which is the central tower), the centre of the building. North of the Central Lobby is the Commons&#x27; Corridor which leads into the square Commons&#x27; Lobby, north of which is the House of Commons.

There are various offices and corridors to the north of the House of Commons with the clock tower terminating the northern axis of the building. South of the Central Lobby is the Peers&#x27; Corridor leading to the Peers&#x27; Lobby, south of which lies the House of Lords. South of the House of Lords in sequence are the Prince&#x27;s Chamber, Royal Gallery, and Queen&#x27;s Robing Room. To the north-west of the Queen&#x27;s Robing Chamber is the Norman Porch, to the west of which the Royal Staircase leads down to the Royal Entrance located immediately beneath the Victoria Tower. East of the Central Lobby is the East Corridor leading to the Lower Waiting Hall, to the east of which is the Members Dining Room located in the very centre of the east front. To the north of the Members Dining Room lies the House of Commons Library, and at the northern end of the east front is the projecting Speaker&#x27;s House, home of the Speaker of the House of Commons. To the south of the Members Dining Room lies various committee rooms followed by House of Lords Library. Projecting from the southern end of the facade is the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s House, home of The Lord Chancellor.

Although Parliament gave Barry a prestigious name in architecture, it nearly finished him off. Completion of the building was very overdue; Barry had estimated it would take six years and cost £724,986 (excluding the cost of the site, embankment and furnishings). However, construction actually took 26 years, and it was also well over budget; by July 1854 the estimated cost was £2,166,846. Those pressures left Barry tired and stressed. The full Barry design was never completed; it would have enclosed New Palace Yard as an internal courtyard, and the clock tower would have been in the north-east corner, with a great gateway in the north-west corner surmounted by the Albert Tower, continuing south along the west front of Westminster Hall.

== Professional life ==

Barry was appointed architect to the Dulwich College estate in 1830, an appointment that last until 1858. Barry attended the inaugural meeting of the Royal Institute of British Architects on 3 December 1834 he became a fellow of the R.I.B.A. and later served as vice-president of the institute, in 1859 he turned down the Presidency of the R.I.B.A.
In 1845 he awarded the commission in the competition for New College, Edinburgh to William Henry Playfair. Barry also served on the Royal Commission (learned committee) developing plans for the Great Exhibition of 1851; also in 1851, he was a co-founder of what became the Royal Architectural Museum. In 1852 he was an assessor on the committee that selected Cuthbert Brodrick&#x27;s design in the competition to design Leeds Town Hall. In 1853 Barry was consulted by Albert, Prince Consort on his plans for creation of what became known as Albertopolis. Barry spent two months in Paris in 1855 representing, along with his friend and fellow architect Charles Robert Cockerell, English architecture on the juries of the Exposition Universelle.

Barry was an active fellow of the Royal Academy, and he was involved in revising the architectural curriculum in 1856. In 1858 Barry was appointed to the St. Paul&#x27;s Committee, whose function was to oversee the maintenance of the Special Evening Service in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and carry out redecoration of the cathedral.

Several architects received their training in Barry&#x27;s office, including: John Hayward, John Gibson, George Somers Leigh Clarke, J. A. Chatwin and his sons Charles Barry and Edward Middleton Barry.

== Personal life and family ==
Barry disliked being away from London. Not liking life in the country, he preferred the bustle and society of the city. He was an early riser, usually between four and six o&#x27;clock in the morning; he only needed four or five hours sleep. He preferred to do his thinking and designing in the morning, but was happy to have company while at work, liking to read to or join in conversation. He had a dislike of public display, considering it hollow and lacking in conviction. His general disposition was sanguine, though he had a quick temper. He preferred science to literature, he frequently attended the Friday night lectures held at the Royal Institution.

Barry was engaged to Sarah Rowsell (1798–1882) in 1817, they married on 7 December 1822 and had seven children together.

Four of Sir Charles Barry&#x27;s five sons followed in his career footsteps. Eldest son Charles Barry (junior) (1823–1900) designed Dulwich College and park in south London and rebuilt Burlington House (home of the Royal Academy) in central London&#x27;s Piccadilly; Edward Middleton Barry (1830–1880) completed the Parliament buildings and designed the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden; Godfrey Walter Barry (1833–1868) became a surveyor; Sir John Wolfe-Barry (1836–1918) was the engineer for Tower Bridge and Blackfriars Railway Bridge. Edward and Charles also collaborated on the design of the Great Eastern Hotel at London&#x27;s Liverpool Street station.

His second son, Rev. Alfred Barry (1826–1910), became a noted clergyman. He was headmaster of Leeds Grammar School from 1854 to 1862 and of Cheltenham College from 1862 to 1868. He later became the third Bishop of Sydney, Australia. He wrote a 400-page biography of his father, &quot;The Life and Times of Sir Charles Barry, R.A., F.R.S.&quot;, that was published in 1867.

Barry&#x27;s daughters were Emily Barry (1828–1886) and Adelaide Sarah Barry (1841–1907).

Sir Charles&#x27; relative John Hayward designed several buildings including, The Hall, Chapel Quad Pembroke College, Oxford.

Two of Barry&#x27;s grandsons continued in the profession, Charles Edward Barry (1855–1937) architect and assistant to his father, and his brother Lt Col Arthur John Barry CBE, TD, MICE (1859–1943), civil engineer and architect, son of Charles Barry Jr. and pupil and later partner of Sir John Wolfe-Barry. He was the author of &quot;Railway Expansion in China and the Influence of Foreign Powers in Its Development&quot; (London, 1910) and is noted for significant infrastructure projects in India, China, Thailand and Egypt. He was the final generation of the Barry architectural and engineering dynasty.

== Death and funeral ==
From onward 1837 Barry suffered from sudden bouts of illness, one of the most severe being in 1858. On 12 May 1860 after an afternoon at the Crystal Palace with Lady Barry, at his home &quot;The Elms&quot;, Clapham Common, he was seized at eleven o&#x27;clock at night with difficulty in breathing and was in pain from a heart attack and died shortly after.

His funeral and interment took place at one o&#x27;clock on 22 May in Westminster Abbey, the cortège formed at Vauxhall Bridge, there were eight pall-bearers: Sir Charles Eastlake; William Cowper-Temple, 1st Baron Mount Temple; George Parker Bidder; Sir Edward Cust, 1st Baronet; Alexander Beresford Hope; The Dean of St. Paul&#x27;s Henry Hart Milman; Charles Robert Cockerell and Sir William Tite. There were several hundred mourners at the funeral service, including his five sons, (it was against custom for women to attend, so neither his widow or daughters were present), his friend Mr Wolfe, numerous members of the House of Commons and Lords, attended, several who were his former clients, about 150 members of the R.I.B.A., including: Decimus Burton, Thomas Leverton Donaldson, Benjamin Ferrey, Charles Fowler, George Godwin, Owen Jones, Henry Edward Kendall, John Norton, Joseph Paxton, James Pennethorne, Anthony Salvin, Sydney Smirke, Lewis Vulliamy, Matthew Digby Wyatt and Thomas Henry Wyatt. Various members of the Royal Society, Royal Academy, Institution of Civil Engineers, Society for the Encouragement of Fine Art and Society of Antiquaries were present. The funeral service was taken by the Dean of Westminster Abbey Richard Chenevix Trench.

Hardman &amp; Co. made the monumental brass marking Barry&#x27;s tomb in the nave at Westminster Abbey shows the Victoria Tower and Plan of the Palace of Westminster flanking a large Christian cross bearing representations of the Paschal Lamb and the four Evangelists and on the stem are roses, leaves, a portcullis and the letter B., beneath is this inscription:

Sacred to the memory of Sir Charles Barry, Knight R.A. F.R.S. &amp; c. Architect of the New Palace of Westminster and other buildings who died the 12th May A.D. 1860 aged 64 years and lies buried beneath this brass.

The brass has this inscription running around its edge:

Whatsoever ye do do it heartily as to the Lord and not unto Men for ye serve the Lord Christ. Col. Colossians III.23.24.

The following tribute was paid by the R.I.B.A.:

The Royal Institute of British Architects impressed with the loss which the profession and the country have sustained through the decease of Sir Charles Barry, whose genius has conferred great lustre upon this age, hereby record their profound sympathy with the affliction which has fallen upon the widow and family of their lamented friend.

Following Barry&#x27;s death a life size white-marble sculpture (1861–65) of him was carved by John Henry Foley and was set up as a memorial to him at the foot of the Committee Stairs in the Palace of Westminster.

<doc id="143683" wikidata="Q6860965" url="?curid=143683" title="Milton Abbey School">
<text>Milton Abbey School is a private school for day and boarding pupils in the village of Milton Abbas, near Blandford Forum in Dorset, in South West England. It has 224 pupils , in five houses: Athelstan, Damer, Hambro, Hodgkinson and Tregonwell. The school was founded in 1954 and is co-educational.

The school has facilities that include a golf course, a 15th-century dining hall, an Abbey chapel that can be traced back to the 10th century and grounds designed by Lancelot &quot;Capability&quot; Brown. The main house was built by Joseph Damer, 1st Earl of Dorchester.

== Academics ==
Milton Abbey School offers the English curriculum of GCSEs, A-levels, and BTECs. The school was named BTEC School of the Year 2019 by BTEC awarding body Pearson. In 2022, Milton Abbey School was noted as having the highest proportion of BTEC student uptake of all English independent schools.

==Abbey Church==

The Abbey forms the central heart of the school. A chapel service takes place for the whole school twice a week. On Monday there is a house assembly and Wednesday a whole school assembly. On Sundays the school gathers for a formal Sunday worship, and there are regular communion services throughout the term. The school, although a Church of England foundation, welcomes people of any faith, and also of none.

The abbey church is built in a mixture of Ham stone, Chilmark stone and flint and consists only of the choir, central tower and transepts. Its style is mostly decorated gothic dating from the mid-14th century with some 15th-century details in the tower and north transept. The eastern Lady Chapel was demolished after the suppression and some alterations were made by Wyatt in the late 18th century. 
The Earl and Countess of Dorchester were also generous to the church, and their joint tomb, designed by Robert Adam with sculpture by Agostino Carlini, is to be found in the north transept. Perhaps the most striking feature of the church&#x27;s interior, however, is its south window, designed as a Tree of Jesse by Augustus Pugin. Other features of interest are the 14th-century pulpitum and sedilia, the 15th-century reredos and pyx canopy, and the 16th-century monument to John Tregonwell.

==History==
Milton Abbey (fully, the Abbey Church of St Mary, St Samson, and St Branwalader) in Dorset was a Benedictine foundation, but only part of the church now survives and is used as the Milton Abbey School chapel. A college of secular canons was founded here by King Athelstan, in 933, and there are two medieval paintings of the king and his mother in the chancel. This foundation was replaced in 964 by a Benedictine monastery by King Edgar. The medieval church burned down in 1309, and although rebuilding started straight away it did not reach its present size until about 1400.

One of the church&#x27;s benefactors was Sir John Tregonwell, whose family came into the possession of the buildings in 1540 following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539. Tregonwell fell from the roof of the church in a childhood accident, but his life was saved when his wide pantaloons filled with air and broke his fall. In thanks, he bequeathed his library to the church. Sir John also was buried in an altar tomb in the Abbey Church.

In 1752, the buildings were bought by the Damer family: in 1771, to make way for a new house and landscaped estate, the 1st Baron Milton (later 1st Earl of Dorchester) demolished the remaining abbey buildings, keeping only part of the church as a private chapel, and the adjacent market town of Milton (creating Milton Abbas to rehouse the former inhabitants) in 1780. The new house was designed by William Chambers and the gardens by Capability Brown. Several members of the Damer family were buried in the family vault in the Abbey Church.

In 1852, the merchant banker Carl Joachim Hambro acquired Milton Abbey to make it his family home.
He set about a major restoration programme, including an extensive refurbishment of the Abbey itself. The Hambro family developed and lived at Milton Abbey until 1932, when it was sold and for a while they moved to Hedge End Farm nearby, followed by a permanent move to Dixton Manor in Gloucestershire.

Milton Abbey School was the setting for &quot;Bamfylde School&quot; in the 1980 13-part TV series of R. F. Delderfield&#x27;s &quot;To Serve Them All My Days&quot;. It also featured in the first of the &quot;Ripping Yarns&quot; by Michael Palin and Terry Jones, titled &quot;Tomkinson&#x27;s Schooldays&quot; and in the 1994 film version of &quot;The Browning Version&quot; with Albert Finney and Greta Scacchi.

===Burials===
*Joseph Damer, 1st Earl of Dorchester
*John Tregonwell
*John Damer
*Carl Joachim Hambro (banker)
*Angus Hambro

===Grounds===
The parklands were landscaped in the late 18th century by Capability Brown. They are Grade II* listed in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

In 2009, the school started to develop a farm, which is worked on by staff, to promote environmental awareness and work towards an element of self-sufficiency. Traditional vegetables are grown, in addition to herbs, cutting flowers, fruit and some crops. The estate also has a small number of pigs, sheep, chickens and ducks.

The school has a golf course which winds around the main house and the Abbey Church. Designed by Peter Alliss and opened in 1972, it is a nine-hole course with par-3 and par-4 hours, which is used by pupils and by visitors, who are required to pay a small green fee. The school employs a PGA Professional, who helps to tutor the students.

<text>Sir William Chambers (23 February 1723 – 10 March 1796) was a Swedish-British architect. Among his best-known works are Somerset House, and the pagoda at Kew. Chambers was a founder member of the Royal Academy.

==Biography==
William Chambers was born on 23 February 1723 in Gothenburg, Sweden, to a Scottish merchant father.

Between 1740 and 1749 he was employed by the Swedish East India Company making three voyages to China where he studied Chinese architecture and decoration.

Returning to Europe, he studied architecture in Paris (with J. F. Blondel) and spent five years in Italy. Then, in 1755, he moved to London, where he established an architectural practice. In 1757, through a recommendation of Lord Bute, he was appointed architectural tutor to the Prince of Wales, later George III, and in 1766 also, along with Robert Adam, Architect to the King, (this being an unofficial title, rather than an actual salaried post with the Office of Works). He worked for Augusta, Dowager Princess of Wales, making fanciful garden buildings at Kew, and in 1757 he published a book of Chinese designs which had a significant influence on contemporary taste. He developed his Chinese interests further with his &quot;Dissertation on Oriental Gardening&quot; (1772), a fanciful elaboration of contemporary English ideas about the naturalistic style of gardening in China.

His more serious and academic &quot;Treatise on Civil Architecture&quot; published in 1759 proved influential on builders; it went into several editions and was still being republished in 1862. It dealt with the use of the classical orders, and gave suggestions for decorative elements, rather than dealing with construction and planning; for its third edition it was retitled &quot;A Treatise on the Decorative Parts of Civil Architecture&quot;. It included ideas from the works of many 16th- and 17th-century Italian architects then still little known in Britain. His influence was also transmitted through a host of younger architects trained as pupils in his office, including Thomas Hardwick (1752–1825), who helped him build Somerset House and who wrote his biography.

He was the major rival of Adam in British Neoclassicism. Chambers was more international in outlook (his knighthood being originally a Swedish honour) and was influenced by continental neoclassicism (which he in turn influenced) when designing for British clients. A second visit to Paris in 1774 confirmed the French cast to his sober and conservative refined blend of Neoclassicism and Palladian conventions.

From around 1758 to the mid-1770s, Chambers concentrated on building houses for the nobility, beginning with one for Lord Bessborough at Roehampton. In 1766 Chambers was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. From 1761 he held the unofficial post of Joint Architect to the King, he was then promoted to his first official post in the Office of Works and was from 1769–82 Comptroller of the King&#x27;s Works, his final promotion put him in charge, from 1782 being Surveyor-General and Comptroller a post he kept until his death.

When a scheme to unite a number of government offices on the site of Somerset House in the Strand was projected, his position did not give him automatic authority over the construction; however when William Robinson, secretary to the board, who had been put in charge of the new building, died in 1775, Chambers became its architect. His initial plans for a great oval courtyard, connected to three smaller, narrow rectangular courts, were soon modified into a simpler rectilinear scheme.

On 10 December 1768 the Royal Academy was founded. Chambers played an important role in the events that led to the Academy&#x27;s foundation, the &quot;Minutes of the General Assembly of the Royal Academy&quot; of 14 December 1768 record &#x27;That some time towards the latter end of November 1768, Mr Chambers waited upon the King and informed him that many artists of reputation together with himself are very desirous of establishing a Society that should more effectively promote the Arts of Design&#x27;. He was appointed the Academy&#x27;s first Treasurer.

Chambers died in London in 1796. He is buried in Poets&#x27; Corner in Westminster Abbey. His tombstone is inscribed:

===Visits by Swedes===
One of Chambers friends, James Maule, wrote in his journal in August 1771: &quot;I visited the Stock Exchange and met John Wilson. I also met several Swedes at sir William Chambers. I spent the Sunday with sir William Chambers at Hampton Court, where his family lives.&quot;

The orientalist Jakob Jonas Björnståhl wrote after a visit at Chambers house in London in 1775:
==Writings==
* &quot;Designs of Chinese Buildings, Furniture, Dresses, Machines, and Utensils. To which is annexed, a Description of their Temples, Houses, Gardens, &amp;c.&quot; (London) 1757
* (London) 1757
* &quot;A treatise on civil architecture in which the principles of that art are laid down and illustrated by a great number of plates accurately designed and elegantly engraved by the best hands&quot; (London) 1759
* &quot;Plans, Elevations, Sections and Perspective Views of the Gardens and Buildings at Kew in Surrey&quot; (London) 1763
* &quot;A dissertation on oriental gardening.&quot; (London) 1772


==Main works==

* Roehampton Villa (largely extant including interior ceilings), now called Parkstead House, for William Ponsonby, 2nd Earl of Bessborough. Also designed two garden temples (one to be re-erected by 2008), similar to those at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.
* Within Kew Gardens, some of his buildings are lost, those remaining being the ten-storey Great Pagoda, the Orangery, the Ruined Arch, the Temple of Bellona and the Temple of Aeolus. The Temple of the Sun survived until 1916, when it was destroyed in a storm.
*The Pagoda, in Pagoda Gardens, Blackheath, London, is attributed to Chambers. A three-storey house built as a pavilion (c. 1775) for the Duke and Duchess of Buccleuch, it features a gabled Chinese-style roof with dramatic upturned corners. Caroline of Brunswick lived here after her separation from her husband, the Prince Regent, in 1799.
*Somerset House in London, his most famous building, which absorbed most of his energies over a period of two decades (1776–1796)
*The gilded state coach that is still used at coronations.
*Hedsor House, Buckinghamshire, the seat of Lord Boston, equerry to George III.
*For James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont, he designed Charlemont House and the Casino at Marino, as well as the chapel and public theatre in Trinity College, Dublin.
*He is also associated with Gothic additions to Milton Abbey in Dorset and the planning of the nearby rural village of Milton Abbas, sometimes considered the first planned settlement in England. This work was carried out in collaboration with landscape gardener Capability Brown in 1780 for Joseph Damer, 1st Earl of Dorchester, who wanted to relocate the existing village further away from his home at the Abbey.
*Wick House, Richmond Hill, commissioned in 1771 by painter Sir Joshua Reynolds.
*Osterley Park, remodelling work in the 1760s.

<text>Selby Abbey is a former Benedictine abbey and current Anglican parish church in the town of Selby, North Yorkshire, England. It is a member of the Major Churches Network in England.

==Monastic history==

The church is one of the relatively few surviving abbey churches of the medieval period, and, although not a cathedral, is one of the biggest. It was founded by Benedict of Auxerre in 1069 and subsequently built by the de Lacy family.

On 31 May 1256, the abbey was bestowed with the grant of a mitre by Pope Alexander IV and from this date was a &quot;Mitred Abbey&quot;. This privilege fell into abeyance a number of times, but on 11 April 1308, Archbishop William Greenfield confirmed the grant, and Selby remained a &quot;Mitred Abbey&quot; until the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

Archbishop Walter Giffard visited the monastery in 1275 by commission, and several monks and the abbot were charged with a list of faults including loose living: many complaints referred to misconduct with married women. In 1279 Archbishop William de Wickwane made a visitation, and found fault with the abbot as he did not observe the Rule of Saint Benedict, was not singing mass, preaching or teaching, and was seldom attending chapter. Things had not improved much in 1306 when Archbishop William Greenfield visited, and similar visitations in later years resulted in similar findings.

The community rebuilt the choir in the early 14th century, but in 1340 a fire destroyed the chapter house, dormitory, treasury and part of the church. The damage was repaired and the decorated windows in the south aisle of the nave were installed.

In 1380–1 there were the abbot and twenty-five monks. In 1393 Pope Boniface IX granted an indulgence to pilgrims who contributed to the conservation of the chapel of the Holy Cross in the abbey.

The 15th century saw more alterations to the abbey. The perpendicular windows in the north transept and at the west end of the nave were added, and the sedilia in the sanctuary were added. One of the final additions was the Latham Chapel, dedicated to St Catherine, east of the north transept, in 1465.

In the &quot;Valor Ecclesiasticus&quot; of 1535 the abbey was valued at £719 2s. 6¼d (equivalent to £ in ). The abbey surrendered on 6 December 1539. The community comprised the abbot and 23 monks. The abbot was pensioned off on £100 a year (equivalent to £ in ) ; the prior got £8 and the others between £6 6s. 8d. (ten marks) and £5 each.

==Post-monastic history==

For a time after the dissolution the church was unused, but in 1618 it became the parish church of Selby. During the English Civil War and the Commonwealth period the building suffered: the north transept window was destroyed, and the statues on the brackets in the choir were demolished. 

Like York Minster, the church rests on a base of sand and has suffered from subsidence. Many sections collapsed entirely during the 17th century, including the central tower in 1690 which destroyed the south transept. The tower was rebuilt, but not the transept. In the 18th century the choir was filled with galleries, and used for services; the nave was used only for secular purposes.

The church was restored by Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1871–1873 who restored much of the nave for use, and again in 1889–1890 by his son John Oldrid Scott, who restored the choir. The tower was restored in the first few years of the 20th century.

The reredos was designed by Robert Lorimer and added in 1901.

===The fire of 1906===

The organ builders from John Compton had been working until 11.00 pm on Friday 19 October, and shortly after midnight on Saturday the organist Frederick William Sykes spotted flames coming from the organ chamber. The organ builders had been installing a new kinetic gas engine to provide power to the new organ. Initial reports that the new organ equipment was to blame for the fire were later proved inaccurate.

The fire destroyed the roof of the choir and the belfry and peal of eight bells was also destroyed. All of the interior fittings were also destroyed but thanks to the actions of the local fire brigade, the fourteenth-century stained glass in the East window was saved.

A secondary fire broke out in the nave roof on the Sunday, but this was quickly extinguished.

The abbey was rebuilt under the supervision of John Oldrid Scott at a cost of around £50,000 (equivalent to £ in ) and reopened in 1909. The restoration of the south transept was completed in 1912, funded by William Liversedge.

===Later twentieth century===

In 1952 the abbey was given Grade I listed status.

===Restorations of 2002===
In 2002 the abbey underwent an extensive restoration, costing several million pounds. Stage 6, the restoration of the Scriptorium was completed at a cost of £795,000. The £400,000 cost of restoring the South choir Aisle and the &quot;Washington Window&quot; was met in full by British American Tobacco. World Monuments Fund committed more than $800,000 to exterior work, including roof repairs, beginning in 2002.

==The Washington Window==
A notable feature of the abbey is the fifteenth-century Washington Window, located at the clerestory level of the quire, which features the heraldic arms of the ancestors of George Washington, the first president of the United States. It is believed the shield is in the Abbey thanks to a financial benefaction supporting the work of the monastery at Selby from John Wessington, one of George Washington&#x27;s ancestors, who was Prior of Durham from 1416 to 1446, and the design is thought to be one of the oldest representations of the Flag of the United States in the world.
Selby Abbey is on the &#x27;American Trail&#x27; of attractions around the UK with strong American historical connections.

==Music==

Music at Selby Abbey has a long history going back to its monastic foundation in the 11th century when plainsong was chanted at the daily services by the Benedictine monks. Today, the music at services consists principally of choral music sung by the Abbey&#x27;s choir, organ music, and congregational hymn singing. 
The Choir of Selby Abbey numbers c35 adults and children. While the choir consists principally of dedicated volunteers, the Abbey provides three Choral Scholarships and employs a professional Director of Music, and Assistant Organist. The Abbey Choristers receive a full musical education and training. During term-time the choir sings at the weekly Sung Eucharist on Sundays, and at Choral Evensong on the 2nd and 4th Sundays of the month, in addition to singing at other special services, weddings and concerts. 
In 2022 the Abbey Junior Choir was founded to provide singing opportunities for younger children aged five and upwards. 

The Abbey hosts many concerts throughout the year performed by choirs, orchestras, brass bands and other musicians and groups. Selby Abbey Trust organises an annual Organ Recital Series featuring performers from across the world.

==Organ==
The previous organ was installed in 1825 by Renn and Boston, in a gallery on the east side of the choir screen wall. It was rebuilt several times by Booth of Wakefield, Forster and Andrews of Hull and Conacher of Huddersfield. In 1868 the organ was rebuilt and moved to a bay in the quire. The opening recital was given by William Thomas Best. This organ was rebuilt in 1891 by James Jepson Binns of Bramley and moved again, this time to the north side of the quire. A rebuild took place by John Compton in 1906, but the organ was destroyed by the great fire of that year, which nearly destroyed the abbey too.

Following the 1906 fire and as part of the subsequent restoration of the Abbey, the firm of William Hill &amp; Son was commissioned to build the current organ, completed in 1909. With 67 speaking stops and 4 manuals, most of the pipes of this instrument occupy two organ cases designed by John Oldrid Scott and placed either side of the choir stalls in the Chancel. The huge pipes of the &quot;Pedal: 32&#x27; Double Open Diapason&quot; sit in the Triforium overlooking the Nave. 

The first major restoration of this organ was carried out in 1950 by Hill, Norman and Beard. In the early 1960s, the Italian virtuoso Fernando Germani made several LP recordings at the Abbey of organ music by Reger, Franck and Liszt, bringing the organ to international attention. In 1975, further alterations and additions were made to the organ by John T. Jackson.

By the 2010s, the organ was showing its age and becoming increasingly unreliable. In 2014, Geoffrey Coffin and Principal Pipe Organs of York were commissioned to carry out a major restoration with Paul Hale as the adviser. The project was completed in 2016.

<doc id="143689" wikidata="Q23664" url="?curid=143689" title="Vacuum flask">
<text>A vacuum flask (also known as a Dewar flask, Dewar bottle or thermos) is an insulating storage vessel that slows the speed at which its contents change in temperature. It greatly lengthens the time over which its contents remain hotter or cooler than the flask&#x27;s surroundings by trying to be as adiabatic as possible. Invented by James Dewar in 1892, the vacuum flask consists of two s, placed one within the other and joined at the neck. The gap between the two flasks is partially evacuated of air, creating a near-vacuum which significantly reduces heat transfer by conduction or convection. When used to hold cold liquids, this also virtually eliminates condensation on the outside of the flask.

Vacuum flasks are used domestically to keep contents inside hot or cold for extended periods of time. They are also used for thermal cooking. Vacuum flasks are also used for many purposes in industry.

== History ==

The vacuum flask was designed and invented by Scottish scientist James Dewar in 1892 as a result of his research in the field of cryogenics and is sometimes called a Dewar flask in his honour. While performing experiments in determining the specific heat of the element palladium, Dewar made a brass chamber that he enclosed in another chamber to keep the palladium at its desired temperature. He evacuated the air between the two chambers, creating a partial vacuum to keep the temperature of the contents stable. Dewar refused to patent his invention; this allowed others to develop the flask using new materials such as glass and aluminium, and it became a significant tool for chemical experiments and also a common household item.

Dewar&#x27;s design was quickly transformed into a commercial item in 1904 as two German glassblowers, Reinhold Burger and Albert Aschenbrenner, discovered that it could be used to keep cold drinks cold and warm drinks warm and invented a more robust flask design, which was suited for everyday use. The Dewar flask design had never been patented but the German men who discovered the commercial use for the product named it &quot;Thermos&quot;, and subsequently claimed both the rights to the commercial product and the trademark to the name. In his subsequent attempt to claim the rights to the invention, Dewar instead lost a court case to the company. The manufacturing and performance of the Thermos bottle was significantly improved and refined by the Viennese inventor and merchant Gustav Robert Paalen, who designed various types for domestic use, which he also patented, and distributed widely, through the Thermos Bottle Companies in the United States, Canada and the UK, which bought licences for respective national markets. The American Thermos Bottle Company built up a mass production in Norwich, CT, which brought prices down and enabled the wide distribution of the product for at-home use. Over time, the company expanded the size, shapes and materials of these consumer products, primarily used for carrying coffee on the go and carrying liquids on camping trips to keep them either hot or cold. Eventually other manufacturers produced similar products for consumer use.

The term &quot;thermos&quot; became a household name for vacuum flasks in general. , &quot;Thermos&quot; and &quot;THERMOS&quot; remains a registered trademark in some countries, including the United States, but the lowercase &quot;thermos&quot; was declared a genericized trademark by court action in the United States in 1963.

== Design ==

The vacuum flask consists of two vessels, one placed within the other and joined at the neck. The gap between the two vessels is partially evacuated of air, creating a partial-vacuum which reduces heat conduction or convection. Heat transfer by thermal radiation may be minimized by silvering flask surfaces facing the gap but can become problematic if the flask&#x27;s contents or surroundings are very hot; hence vacuum flasks usually hold contents below the boiling point of water. Most heat transfer occurs through the neck and opening of the flask, where there is no vacuum. Vacuum flasks are usually made of metal, borosilicate glass, foam or plastic and have their opening stoppered with cork or polyethylene plastic. Vacuum flasks are often used as insulated shipping containers.

Extremely large or long vacuum flasks sometimes cannot fully support the inner flask from the neck alone, so additional support is provided by &quot;spacers&quot; between the interior and exterior shell. These spacers act as a thermal bridge and partially reduce the insulating properties of the flask around the area where the spacer contacts the interior surface.

Several technological applications, such as NMR and MRI machines, rely on the use of double vacuum flasks. These flasks have two vacuum sections. The inner flask contains liquid helium and the outer flask contains liquid nitrogen, with one vacuum section in between. The loss of precious helium is limited in this way.

Other improvements to the vacuum flask include the &quot;vapour-cooled radiation shield&quot; and the &quot;vapour-cooled neck&quot;, both of which help to reduce evaporation from the flask.

== Research and industry ==


In laboratories and industry, vacuum flasks are often used to hold liquefied gases (commonly liquid nitrogen with a boiling point of 77 K) for flash freezing, sample preparation and other processes where creating or maintaining an extreme low temperature is desired. Larger vacuum flasks store liquids that become gaseous at well below ambient temperature, such as oxygen and nitrogen; in this case the leakage of heat into the extremely cold interior of the bottle results in a slow boiling-off of the liquid so that a narrow unstoppered opening, or a stoppered opening protected by a pressure relief valve, is necessary to prevent pressure from building up and eventually shattering the flask. The insulation of the vacuum flask results in a very slow &quot;boil&quot; and thus the contents remain liquid for long periods without refrigeration equipment.

Vacuum flasks have been used to house standard cells and ovenized Zener diodes, along with their printed circuit board, in precision voltage-regulating devices used as electrical standards. The flask helped with controlling the Zener temperature over a long time span and was used to reduce variations of the output voltage of the Zener standard owing to temperature fluctuation to within a few parts per million.

One notable use was by Guildline Instruments, of Canada, in their Transvolt, model 9154B, saturated standard cell, which is an electrical voltage standard. Here a silvered vacuum flask was encased in foam insulation and, using a large glass vacuum plug, held the saturated cell. The output of the device was 1.018 volts and was held to within a few parts per million.

The principle of the vacuum flask makes it ideal for storing certain types of rocket fuel, and NASA used it extensively in the propellant tanks of the Saturn launch vehicles in the 1960s and 1970s.

The design and shape of the Dewar flask was used as a model for optical experiments based on the idea that the shape of the two compartments with the space in between is similar to the way the light hits the eye. The vacuum flask has also been part of experiments using it as the capacitor of different chemicals in order to keep them at a consistent temperature.

The industrial Dewar flask is the base for a device used to passively insulate medical shipments. Most vaccines are sensitive to heat and require a cold chain system to keep them at stable, near freezing temperatures. The Arktek device uses eight one-litre ice blocks to hold vaccines at under 10 °C.

In the oil and gas industry, Dewar flasks are used to insulate the electronic components in wireline logging tools. Conventional logging tools (rated to 350 °F) are upgraded to high-temperature specifications by installing all sensitive electronic components in a Dewar flask.

== Safety ==
Vacuum flasks are at risk of implosion hazard, and glass vessels under vacuum, in particular, may shatter unexpectedly. Chips, scratches or cracks can be a starting point for dangerous vessel failure, especially when the vessel temperature changes rapidly (when hot or cold liquid is added). Proper preparation of the Dewar vacuum flask by tempering prior to use is advised to maintain and optimize the functioning of the unit. Glass vacuum flasks are usually fitted into a metal base with the cylinder contained in or coated with mesh, aluminum or plastic to aid in handling, protect it from physical damage, and contain fragments should they break.

In addition, cryogenic storage dewars are usually pressurized, and they may explode if pressure relief valves are not used.

Thermal expansion has to be taken into account when engineering a vacuum flask. The outer and inner walls are exposed to different temperatures and will expand at different rates. The vacuum flask can rupture due to the differential in thermal expansion between the outer and inner walls. Expansion joints are commonly used in tubular vacuum flasks to avoid rupture and maintain vacuum integrity.

<doc id="143691" wikidata="Q298376" url="?curid=143691" title="Gaius Julius Hyginus">
<text>Gaius Julius Hyginus (; 64 BC – AD 17) was a Latin author, a pupil of the scholar Alexander Polyhistor, and a freedman of Augustus, and reputed author of the &quot;Fabulae&quot; and the &quot;De astronomia&quot;, although this is disputed.

== Life and works ==
Hyginus may have originated either from Spain, or from the Egyptian city of Alexandria. He was elected superintendent of the Palatine library by Augustus according to Suetonius&#x27; &quot;De Grammaticis&quot;, 20.

Suetonius remarks that Hyginus fell into great poverty in his old age and was supported by the historian Clodius Licinus. Hyginus was a voluminous author: his works included topographical and biographical treatises, commentaries on Helvius Cinna and the poems of Virgil, and disquisitions on agriculture and bee-keeping. All these are lost.

== Attributed works ==
Two Latin works which have survived under the name of Hyginus are a mythological handbook, known as the &quot;Genealogiae&quot; or the &quot;Fabulae&quot;, and an astronomical work, entitled &quot;De astronomia&quot;. Though there a handful of scholars who posit that Gaius Julius Hyginus was the Hyginus who authored these works, there is general agreement that they were composed by a separate author. In the earliest edition of the &quot;Fabulae&quot;, produced in 1535 by Jacob Micyllus, the work is ascribed to Gaius Julius Hyginus, though it is unclear whether this attribution was added by Micyllus himself, or was there prior to him.

==Legacy==
The lunar crater Hyginus and the minor planet 12155 Hyginus are named after him.

The English author Sir Thomas Browne opens his discourse &quot;The Garden of Cyrus&quot; (1658) with a Creation myth sourced from the &quot;Fabulae&quot; of Hyginus.

<text>Adriano Balbi (April 25, 1782 – March 14, 1848), Italian geographer, was born at Venice. The publication of his &quot;Prospetto politico-geografico dello stato attuale del globo&quot; (Venice, 1808) obtained his election to the chair of professor of geography at the college of San Michele at Murano; in 1811–1813 he was professor of physics at the Lyceum of Fermo, and afterwards became attached to the customs office at his native city.

In 1820 he visited Portugal, and there collected materials for his &quot;Essai statistique sur le royaume de Portugal et d’Algarve&quot;, published in 1822 at Paris, where the author resided from 1821 until 1832. This was followed by &quot;Variétés politiques et statistiques de la monarchie portugaise&quot;, which contains some observations respecting that country under the Roman sway. In 1826 he published the first volume of his &quot;Atlas ethnographique du globe, ou classification des peuples anciens et modernes d’après leurs langues&quot;, a work of great erudition. In 1829 he published, with Andre-Michel Guerry, &quot;Statistique comparée de l&#x27;état de l&#x27;instruction et du nombre des crimes dans les divers arrondissements des Académies et des Cours Royales de France&quot;, the first comparative choropleth map showing crime in relation to level of instruction.

In 1832 appeared the &quot;Abrégé de Geographie&quot;, which, in an enlarged form, was translated. into the principal languages of Europe. Balbi retired to Padua and there died in 1848.

His son, Eugenio Balbi (1812–1884), followed a similar career, being professor of geography at Pavia, and publishing his father&#x27;s &quot;Scritti Geografici&quot; (Turin, 1841), and original works in &quot;Gea, ossia la terra&quot; (Trieste, 1854–1867) and &quot;Saggio di geografia&quot; (Milan, 1868).

<text>Tera Patrick (born Linda Ann Hopkins; July 25, 1976) is an American former pornographic actress who was the &quot;Penthouse&quot; Pet of the Month for February 2000 and is an inductee of the NightMoves, AVN and XRCO Halls of Fame. She is a recipient of the Hot d&#x27;Or Award, NightMoves Award, AVN Award, XRCO Award, Venus Award, Adultcon Award, Adam Film World Guide Award, Eroticline Award, FOXE Award, FAME Award, Fanny Award, XBIZ Award, and ASACP Service Recognition Award.

==Early life==
Tera Patrick was born July 25, 1976 in Great Falls, Montana and raised near San Francisco, California. Her mother is Thai and her father is of English, Irish and Dutch descent. When she was ten, her mother left her and she grew up with her father David Hopkins, a carefree hippie. She took weekend classes at the Barbizon Modeling and Acting School for two years. She has stated that she was sexually assaulted at one of her first photo shoots by the photographer. She said he &quot;was feeding [her] champagne and Valium&quot; until she &quot;was getting wasted&quot;. Later, she spent two years in Tokyo, where &quot;she became addicted to Valium and alcohol and spent her paychecks on shopping sprees&quot;. When her father learned she had become sexually active, he complained to her agency, pointing out she was underage. She was sent back to the United States, &quot;sixteen years old and already a washed-up model&quot;. At age 18, she obtained a GED, briefly studied nursing at Boise State University, then received EMT certification from a local vocational school.

==Career==
Patrick has appeared in &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot;, where she was the &quot;Pet of the Month&quot; for February 2000 and was selected as &quot;Pet of the Year&quot; runner-up. In 2003, Patrick became the masthead publisher of &quot;Genesis&quot;.

In 2006, Patrick and her then-husband, Evan Seinfeld, launched a talent agency representing models and actors. According to a quote on the agency&#x27;s website, Patrick&#x27;s goal &quot;is to help girls (and guys) in the business to be treated with respect, and realize their true potential...&quot; Additionally, she owns a production company called &quot;Teravision&quot;, which along with Vivid Video released its first feature, &quot;Desperate&quot;, starring Patrick and Seinfeld. In April 2006, it was announced that she would host the Exxxotica Miami convention.

In November 2006, Patrick starred in a Vivid/Teravision production titled &quot;Tera Patrick&#x27;s Fashion Underground&quot; where she performed with Jean Val Jean and Tommy Gunn. In the same film her husband, under the name Spyder Jonez, performed with Lanny Barby. In an interview, Tera Patrick says she&#x27;s OK with him doing scenes with other girls. The two made five movies for Vivid and ten for Teravision (with Seinfeld appearing under the name &quot;Spyder Jonez&quot;; he has also directed some features).

In an interview with the Adult Film Database in February 2007, Patrick stated she would only continue to work in front of the camera for two more years, but planned on releasing her starring adult titles over the next decade.

In 2008, Patrick began hosting the Playboy TV erotic instructional show, &quot;School of Sex&quot;. She was also the host for 25th AVN Awards ceremony.

Patrick retired from shooting scenes in the adult industry in 2008 but continues to operate her website, production company, and pursue other business ventures. She licenses her movie catalog worldwide.

In January 2013, Patrick hosted the annual XBIZ Awards.

Patrick commented, &quot;I wanted the book to end happily. I knew there were problems with our marriage obviously, and the decision to leave him came about quite suddenly.&quot;

==Personal life==

After a three-year relationship, Patrick married musician and fellow porn actor Evan Seinfeld in a small ceremony in Las Vegas on January 9, 2004, where they were attending the 2004 AVN Awards show. On September 30, 2009, the couple announced that they were ending their marriage. Tera remains sole owner of her production company, TeraVision Inc.

Patrick gave birth to a girl on February 25, 2012. The father is Hollywood special effects artist Tony Acosta, known for his work on &quot;300&quot;, &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; and &quot;Man of Steel&quot;.

In an interview with Holly Randall on September 6, 2018, Patrick stated that she moved to Italy with her daughter, where she married an Italian defense attorney. She first visited the country in 2015 after getting an offer to do feature dance shows.

<text>The orbital period (also revolution period) is the amount of time a given astronomical object takes to complete one orbit around another object. In astronomy, it usually applies to planets or asteroids orbiting the Sun, moons orbiting planets, exoplanets orbiting other stars, or binary stars. It may also refer to the time it takes a satellite orbiting a planet or moon to complete one orbit.

For celestial objects in general, the orbital period is determined by a 360° revolution of one body around its primary, &quot;e.g.&quot; Earth around the Sun. 

Periods in astronomy are expressed in units of time, usually hours, days, or years.
Its reciprocal is the orbital frequency, a kind of revolution frequency, in units of hertz.

==Small body orbiting a central body==

According to Kepler&#x27;s Third Law, the orbital period &quot;T&quot; of two point masses orbiting each other in a circular or elliptic orbit is:

:formula_1

where:
* &quot;a&quot; is the orbit&#x27;s semi-major axis
* &quot;G&quot; is the gravitational constant,
* &quot;M&quot; is the mass of the more massive body.

For all ellipses with a given semi-major axis the orbital period is the same, regardless of eccentricity.

Inversely, for calculating the distance where a body has to orbit in order to have a given orbital period T:

:formula_2

For instance, for completing an orbit every 24 hours around a mass of 100 kg, a small body has to orbit at a distance of 1.08 meters from the central body&#x27;s center of mass.

In the special case of perfectly circular orbits, the semimajor axis a is equal to the radius of the orbit, and the orbital velocity is constant and equal to

: formula_3

where:
* &quot;r&quot; is the circular orbit&#x27;s radius in meters,

This corresponds to times (≈ 0.707 times) the escape velocity.

===Effect of central body&#x27;s density===
For a perfect sphere of uniform density, it is possible to rewrite the first equation without measuring the mass as:

:formula_4

where:
* &quot;r&quot; is the sphere&#x27;s radius
* &quot;a&quot; is the orbit&#x27;s semi-major axis in metres,
* &quot;G&quot; is the gravitational constant,
* &quot;ρ&quot; is the density of the sphere in kilograms per cubic metre.

For instance, a small body in circular orbit 10.5 cm above the surface of a sphere of tungsten half a metre in radius would travel at slightly more than 1 mm/s, completing an orbit every hour. If the same sphere were made of lead the small body would need to orbit just 6.7 mm above the surface for sustaining the same orbital period.

When a very small body is in a circular orbit barely above the surface of a sphere of any radius and mean density &quot;ρ&quot; (in kg/m3), the above equation simplifies to (since )

:formula_5

Thus the orbital period in low orbit depends only on the density of the central body, regardless of its size.

So, for the Earth as the central body (or any other spherically symmetric body with the same mean density, about 5,515 kg/m3, e.g. Mercury with 5,427 kg/m3 and Venus with 5,243 kg/m3) we get:
:&quot;T&quot; = 1.41 hours

and for a body made of water (&quot;ρ&quot; ≈ 1,000 kg/m3), or bodies with a similar density, e.g. Saturn&#x27;s moons Iapetus with 1,088 kg/m3 and Tethys with 984 kg/m3 we get:

:&quot;T&quot; = 3.30 hours

Thus, as an alternative for using a very small number like &quot;G&quot;, the strength of universal gravity can be described using some reference material, such as water: the orbital period for an orbit just above the surface of a spherical body of water is 3 hours and 18 minutes. Conversely, this can be used as a kind of &quot;universal&quot; unit of time if we have a unit of density.

==Two bodies orbiting each other==

In celestial mechanics, when both orbiting bodies&#x27; masses have to be taken into account, the orbital period &quot;T&quot; can be calculated as follows:

:formula_6

where:
* &quot;a&quot; is the sum of the semi-major axes of the ellipses in which the centers of the bodies move, or equivalently, the semi-major axis of the ellipse in which one body moves, in the frame of reference with the other body at the origin (which is equal to their constant separation for circular orbits),
* &quot;M&quot;1 + &quot;M&quot;2 is the sum of the masses of the two bodies,
* &quot;G&quot; is the gravitational constant.

In a parabolic or hyperbolic trajectory, the motion is not periodic, and the duration of the full trajectory is infinite.

==Related periods==
For celestial objects in general, the orbital period typically refers to the sidereal period, determined by a 360° revolution of one body around its primary relative to the fixed stars projected in the sky. For the case of the Earth orbiting around the Sun, this period is referred to as the sidereal year. This is the orbital period in an inertial (non-rotating) frame of reference.

Orbital periods can be defined in several ways. The tropical period is more particularly about the position of the parent star. It is the basis for the solar year, and respectively the calendar year.

The synodic period refers not to the orbital relation to the parent star, but to other celestial objects, making it not a merely different approach to the orbit of an object around its parent, but a period of orbital relations with other objects, normally Earth, and their orbits around the Sun. It applies to the elapsed time where planets return to the same kind of phenomenon or location, such as when any planet returns between its consecutive observed conjunctions with or oppositions to the Sun. For example, Jupiter has a synodic period of 398.8 days from Earth; thus, Jupiter&#x27;s opposition occurs once roughly every 13 months.

There are many periods related to the orbits of objects, each of which are often used in the various fields of astronomy and astrophysics, particularly they must not be confused with other revolving periods like rotational periods. Examples of some of the common orbital ones include the following:

* The synodic period is the amount of time that it takes for an object to reappear at the same point in relation to two or more other objects. In common usage, these two objects are typically Earth and the Sun. The time between two successive oppositions or two successive conjunctions is also equal to the synodic period. For celestial bodies in the solar system, the synodic period (with respect to Earth and the Sun) differs from the tropical period owing to Earth&#x27;s motion around the Sun. For example, the synodic period of the Moon&#x27;s orbit as seen from Earth, relative to the Sun, is 29.5 mean solar days, since the Moon&#x27;s phase and position relative to the Sun and Earth repeats after this period. This is longer than the sidereal period of its orbit around Earth, which is 27.3 mean solar days, owing to the motion of Earth around the Sun.
* The draconitic period (also draconic period or nodal period), is the time that elapses between two passages of the object through its ascending node, the point of its orbit where it crosses the ecliptic from the southern to the northern hemisphere. This period differs from the sidereal period because both the orbital plane of the object and the plane of the ecliptic precess with respect to the fixed stars, so their intersection, the line of nodes, also precesses with respect to the fixed stars. Although the plane of the ecliptic is often held fixed at the position it occupied at a specific epoch, the orbital plane of the object still precesses, causing the draconitic period to differ from the sidereal period.
* The anomalistic period is the time that elapses between two passages of an object at its periapsis (in the case of the planets in the Solar System, called the perihelion), the point of its closest approach to the attracting body. It differs from the sidereal period because the object&#x27;s semi-major axis typically advances slowly.
* Also, the tropical period of Earth (a tropical year) is the interval between two alignments of its rotational axis with the Sun, also viewed as two passages of the object at a right ascension of 0 hr. One Earth year is slightly shorter than the period for the Sun to complete one circuit along the ecliptic (a sidereal year) because the inclined axis and equatorial plane slowly precess (rotate with respect to reference stars), realigning with the Sun before the orbit completes. This cycle of axial precession for Earth, known as &quot;precession of the equinoxes&quot;, recurs roughly every 25,772 years.

Periods can be also defined under different specific astronomical definitions that are mostly caused by the small complex external gravitational influences of other celestial objects. Such variations also include the true placement of the centre of gravity between two astronomical bodies (barycenter), perturbations by other planets or bodies, orbital resonance, general relativity, etc. Most are investigated by detailed complex astronomical theories using celestial mechanics using precise positional observations of celestial objects via astrometry.

===Synodic period===

One of the observable characteristics of two bodies which orbit a third body in different orbits, and thus have different orbital periods, is their synodic period, which is the time between conjunctions.

An example of this related period description is the repeated cycles for celestial bodies as observed from the Earth&#x27;s surface, the synodic period, applying to the elapsed time where planets return to the same kind of phenomenon or for example, when any planet returns between its consecutive observed conjunctions with or oppositions to the Sun. For example, Jupiter has a synodic period of 398.8 days from Earth; thus, Jupiter&#x27;s opposition occurs once roughly every 13 months.

If the orbital periods of the two bodies around the third are called &quot;T&quot;1 and &quot;T&quot;2, so that &quot;T&quot;1 &lt; &quot;T&quot;2, their synodic period is given by:

:formula_7

==Examples of sidereal and synodic periods==
Table of synodic periods in the Solar System, relative to Earth:

In the case of a planet&#x27;s moon, the synodic period usually means the Sun-synodic period, namely, the time it takes the moon to complete its illumination phases, completing the solar phases for an astronomer on the planet&#x27;s surface. The Earth&#x27;s motion does not determine this value for other planets because an Earth observer is not orbited by the moons in question. For example, Deimos&#x27;s synodic period is 1.2648 days, 0.18% longer than Deimos&#x27;s sidereal period of 1.2624 d.

=== Relative synodic periods ===

The concept of synodic period applies not just to the Earth, but also to other planets as well; the computation of synodic periods applies the same formula as above. The following table lists the synodic periods of some planets relative to each the Sun and each other:

<text>Cesare Balbo, Conte di Vinadio (21 November 1789 – 3 June 1853), was an Italian writer and statesman.

== Biography ==
Balbo was born in Turin on 21 November 1789. His father, Prospero Balbo, who belonged to a noble Piedmontese family, held a high position in the court of the Savoyard Kingdom of Sardinia, and at the time of Cesare&#x27;s birth was mayor of the capital. His mother, Enrichetta Taparelli d&#x27;Azeglio, died when he was three years old; and he was brought up in the house of his great-grandmother, the countess of Bugino. In 1798 he joined his father at Paris. From 1808 to 1814 Balbo served in various capacities under the Napoleonic empire in Florence, Rome, Paris and in Illyria. On the fall of Napoleon, he entered the service of his native country. While his father was appointed minister of the interior, he entered the army, and undertook political missions to Paris and London. On the outbreak of the revolution of 1821, of which he disapproved, although he was suspected of sympathizing with it, he was forced into exile; and though not long after he was allowed to return to Piedmont, all public service was denied him.

Reluctantly, and with frequent endeavours to obtain some appointment, he gave himself up to literature as the only means left him to influence the destinies of his country. The great object of his labours was to help in securing the independence of Italy from foreign control. Of true Italian unity, he had no expectation and no desire, but he was devoted to the house of Savoy, which he foresaw was destined to change the fate of Italy. A confederation of separate states, not under the supremacy of the pope like Gioberti, but led by Piedmont, was the genuine ideal of Balbo. But Gioberti, in his Primato, seemed to him to neglect the first essential of independence, which he accordingly inculcated in his &quot;Speranze or Hopes of Italy&quot;, in which he suggests that Austria should seek compensation in the Balkans for the inevitable loss of her Italian provinces. Balbo believed that the papacy could become an enemy of a large, united Italy (as it did, indeed, become for many years). Preparation, banter military and moral, alertness and patience were his constant theme.

He did not desire revolution, but reform; and thus he became the leader of a moderate party, and the steady opponent not only of despotism but of democracy. At last in 1848 his hopes were to some extent satisfied by the constitution granted by the king, known as the &quot;Statuto Albertino&quot;. He was appointed a member of the commission on the electoral law, and became the first constitutional prime minister of Piedmont, but only held office a few months. With the ministry of d’Azeglio, which soon after came to power, he was on friendly terms, and his pen continued the active defence of his political principles till his death on 3 June 1853. He published &quot;Quattro Novelle&quot; in 1829; &quot;Storia d’Italia sotto i Barbari&quot; in 1830; &quot;Vita di Dante&quot;, 1839; &quot;Meditazioni Storiche&quot;, 1842—1845; &quot;Le Speranze d’Italia&quot;, 1844; &quot;Pensieri sulla Storia d’Italia&quot;, 1858; &quot;Della Monarchia rappresentativa in Italia&quot; (Florence, 1857).

<text>Jaroslav Heyrovský (; 20 December 1890 – 27 March 1967) was a Czech chemist and inventor who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1959 for his invention of polarography.

== Life and work ==

Jaroslav Heyrovský was born in Prague on December 20, 1890, the fifth child of Leopold Heyrovský, Professor of Roman Law at the Charles University in Prague, and his wife Clara, née Hanl von Kirchtreu. He obtained his early education at secondary school until 1909 when he began his study of chemistry, physics, and mathematics at the Charles University in Prague. From 1910 to 1914 he continued his studies at University College London, under Professors Sir William Ramsay, W. C. McC. Lewis, and F. G. Donnan, taking his B.Sc. degree in 1913. He was particularly interested in working with Professor Donnan, on electrochemistry.

During the First World War Heyrovský worked in a military hospital as a dispensing chemist and radiologist, which enabled him to continue his studies and to take his Ph.D. degree in Prague in 1918 and D.Sc. in London in 1921.

Heyrovský started his university career as assistant to Professor B. Brauner in the Institute of Analytical Chemistry of the Charles University, Prague; he was promoted to Associate Professor in 1922 and in 1926 he became the university&#x27;s first professor of physical chemistry.

Heyrovský&#x27;s invention of the polarographic method dates from 1922 and he concentrated his whole further scientific activity on the development of this new branch of electrochemistry. He formed a school of Czech polarographers in the university, and was himself in the forefront of polarographic research. In 1950 Heyrovský was appointed as the Director of the newly established Polarographic Institute, which was incorporated into the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences in 1952.

In 1926 Professor Heyrovský married Marie (Mary) Koranová, and the couple had two children, a daughter, Jitka, and a son, Michael.

Jaroslav Heyrovský died on March 27, 1967. He was interred in the Vyšehrad cemetery in Prague.

== Honors, awards, legacy ==

Many universities and seats of learning honored Heyrovský. He was elected Fellow of University College, London, in 1927, and received honorary doctorates from the Technical University, Dresden in 1955, the University of Warsaw in 1956, the University Aix-Marseille in 1959, and the University of Paris in 1960. He was granted honorary membership in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1933; in the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1955; the Indian Academy of Sciences, Bangalore, in 1955; the Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, in 1962; was elected Corresponding Member of the German Academy of Sciences, Berlin, in 1955; member of the German Academy of Natural Scientists, Leopoldina (Halle-Saale) in 1956; Foreign Member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences, Copenhagen, in 1962; Vice-President of the International Union of Physics from 1951 to 1957; President and first honorary member of the Polarographic Society, London; honorary member of the Polarographic Society of Japan; honorary member of the Chemical Societies of Czechoslovakia, Austria, Poland, England and India. In 1965, Heyrovský was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1965.

In Czechoslovakia Heyrovský was awarded the State Prize, First Grade, in 1951, and in 1955 the Order of the Czechoslovak Republic.

Heyrovský lectured on polarography in the United States in 1933, the USSR in 1934, England in 1946, Sweden in 1947, the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1958, and in U.A.R. (Egypt) in 1960 and 1961.

The crater Heyrovský on the Moon is named in his honour.

<text>The Ardennes ( ; ; ; ; ), also known as the Ardennes Forest or Forest of Ardennes, is a region of extensive forests, rough terrain, rolling hills and ridges primarily in Belgium and Luxembourg, extending into Germany and France.

Geologically, the range is a western extension of the Eifel; both were raised during the Givetian age of the Devonian (382.7 to 387.7 million years ago), as were several other named ranges of the same greater range.

The Ardennes proper stretches well into Germany and France (lending its name to the Ardennes department and the former Champagne-Ardenne region) and geologically into the Eifel (the eastern extension of the Ardennes Forest into Bitburg-Prüm, Germany); most of it is in the southeast of Wallonia, the southern and more rural part of Belgium (away from the coastal plain but encompassing more than half of the country&#x27;s total area). The eastern part of the Ardennes forms the northernmost third of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, also called &quot;Éislek&quot; (). On the southeast the Eifel region continues into the German state of the Rhineland-Palatinate.

The trees and rivers of the Ardennes provided the charcoal industry assets that enabled the great industrial period of Wallonia in the 18th and 19th centuries, when it was arguably the second great industrial region of the world. The greater region maintained an industrial eminence into the 20th century, after coal replaced charcoal in metallurgy. The strategic position of the Ardennes has made it a battleground for European powers for centuries; it was the site of major battles during both World Wars.

==Geography==

Much of the Ardennes is covered in dense forests, with the hills averaging around in height but rising to over in the boggy moors of the High Fens region of south-eastern Belgium. The region is typified by steep-sided valleys carved by swift-flowing rivers, the most prominent of which is the Meuse. Its most populous cities are Verviers in Belgium and Charleville-Mézières in France, both exceeding 50,000 inhabitants. The Ardennes is otherwise relatively sparsely populated, with few of the towns exceeding 10,000 inhabitants. (Exceptions include Belgium&#x27;s Eupen and Bastogne.)

The Eifel range in Germany adjoins the Ardennes and is part of the same geological formation, although they are conventionally regarded as being two distinct areas.

=== High ranging summits ===
* Signal de Botrange , Liège Province, Belgium - highest point in the Ardennes, highest point in the Benelux countries
* Weißer Stein , Mürringen, Liège Province, Belgium
* Baraque Michel , Liège Province, Belgium
* Baraque de Fraiture, , highest point of the Plateau des Tailles, Luxembourg Province, Belgium
* Lieu-dit (= hamlet) Galata, , highest point on the Plateau de Saint-Hubert, Luxembourg Province, Belgium
* Kneiff, , highest point in the nation of Luxembourg (Grand Duchy of Luxembourg)
* Buurgplaatz, , Grand Duchy of Luxembourg
* Napoléonsgaard, , near Rambrouch, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg
* Croix Scaille , on the border of the provinces of Namur, Belgium, and Champagne, France

==Geology==

The Ardennes are the remnants of a mountain range formed during the Hercynian orogeny; in France similar formations are the Armorican Massif, the Massif Central, and the Vosges. The low interior of such former mountains often contains coal, plus iron, zinc and other metals in the sub-soil. This geologic fact explains the greatest part of the geography of Wallonia and its history. In the North and West of the Ardennes lie the valleys of the Sambre and Meuse rivers, forming an arc (Sillon industriel) going across the most industrial provinces of Wallonia, for example Hainaut Province, along the river Haine (the etymology of Hainaut); the Borinage, the &quot;Centre&quot; and Charleroi along the river Sambre; Liège Province along the river Meuse.

The region the Ardennes are part of has been uplifted further in the last few hundred thousand years by a mantle plume, as measured from the present elevation of old river terraces, with the largest amount of uplift concentrated in the east, where the Ardennes connect with the Eifel, where the same mantle plume is also responsible for volcanic activity.

This geological region is important in the history of Wallonia because this former mountain is at the origin of the economy, the history, and the geography of Wallonia. &quot;Wallonia presents a wide range of rocks of various ages. Some geological stages internationally recognized were defined from rock sites located in Wallonia: e.g., Frasnian (Frasnes-lez-Couvin), Famennian (Famenne), Tournaisian (Tournai), Visean (Visé), Dinantian (Dinant), and Namurian (Namur)&quot;. Except for the Tournaisian, all these rocks are within the Ardennes geological area.

==Economy==
The Ardennes includes the greatest part of Belgium&#x27;s Luxembourg Province (not to be confused with the neighbouring Grand Duchy of Luxembourg), the south of Namur Province, and Liège Province, plus a very small part of Hainaut Province, as well as the northernmost third of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, called &quot;Éislek&quot; () and the main part of the French Ardennes department.

Before the 19th century industrialization, the first furnaces in these four Belgian provinces (all in the Wallonia region) and in the French Ardennes used charcoal for fuel, made from harvesting the Ardennes forest. This industry was also in the extreme south of present-day Luxembourg Province (which until 1839 was part of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg), in the region called Gaume. The most important part of the Walloon steel industry, using coal, was built around the coal mines, mainly in the region around the cities of Liège, Charleroi, La Louvière, the Borinage, and further in the Walloon Brabant (in Tubize). Wallonia became the second industrial power area of the world (after Great Britain) in proportion to its territory and to its population (see further).

The rugged terrain and the harsh climate of the Ardennes limits the scope for agriculture; arable and dairy farming in cleared areas form the mainstay of the agricultural economy. The region is rich in timber and minerals, and Liège and the city of Namur are both major industrial centres. The extensive forests have an abundant population of wild game. The scenic beauty of the region and its wide variety of outdoor activities, including hunting, cycling, walking and canoeing, make it a popular tourist destination.

==Etymology==
The region takes its name from the vast ancient forest known as &quot;Arduenna Silva&quot; in the Roman Period. &quot;Arduenna&quot; probably derives from a Gaulish cognate of the Brythonic word &quot;ardu-&quot; as in the (&quot;high&quot;) and the Latin &quot;arduus&quot; (&quot;high&quot;, &quot;steep&quot;). The second element is less certain, but may be related to the Celtic element &quot;*windo-&quot; as in the Welsh &quot;wyn&quot;/&quot;wen&quot; (&quot;fair&quot;, &quot;blessed&quot;), which tentatively suggests an original meaning of &quot;forest of blessed/fair heights&quot;.

The Ardennes likely shares this derivation with the numerous &quot;Arden&quot; place names in Britain, including the Forest of Arden.

==History==
The modern Ardennes region covers a greatly diminished area from the forest recorded in Roman times.

A song about Charlemagne, the Old French 12th-century chanson de geste &quot;Quatre Fils Aymon&quot;, mentions many of Wallonia&#x27;s rivers, villages and other places. In Dinant the rock named &quot;Bayard&quot; takes its name for Bayard, the magic bay horse which, according to legend, jumped from the top of the rock to the other bank of the Meuse.

On their pillaging raids in the years 881 and 882, the Vikings used the old Roman roads in the Ardennes and attacked the abbeys of Malmedy and Stavelot and destroyed Prüm Abbey in the Eifel.

The strategic position of the Ardennes has made it a battleground for European powers for many centuries. Much of the Ardennes formed part of the Duchy (since 1815, the Grand Duchy) of Luxembourg, a member state of the Holy Roman Empire, which changed hands numerous times between the powerful dynasties of Europe. In 1793 revolutionary France annexed the whole area, together with all other territories west of the Rhine river. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna, which dealt with the political aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, restored the previous geographical situation, with most of the Ardennes becoming part of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. After the revolution of 1830, which resulted in the establishment of the Kingdom of Belgium, the political future of the Ardennes became a matter of much dispute between Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, as well as involving the contemporary great powers of France, Prussia, and Great Britain. As a result, in 1839, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg ceded the westernmost 63% of its territory (being also the main part of the Ardennes) to the new Kingdom of Belgium, which is now its Luxembourg Province.

In the 20th century the Ardennes was widely thought by leading military strategists to be unsuitable for large-scale military operations, due to its difficult terrain and narrow lines of communications. However, in both World War I and World War II, Germany successfully gambled on making a rapid passage through the Ardennes to attack a relatively lightly defended part of France. The Ardennes became the site of three major battles during the world wars—the Battle of the Ardennes (August 1914) in World War I, and the Battle of France (1940) and the Battle of the Bulge (1944–1945) in World War II. Many of the towns of the region suffered severe damage during the two world wars.

Allied generals in World War II believed that the region was impenetrable to massed vehicular traffic and especially armor, so the area was effectively &quot;all but undefended&quot; during the war. The German Army twice used this region to invade northern France and southern Belgium, via Luxembourg in the Battle of France and the later Battle of the Bulge.

The military strategists of Nazi Germany in 1939 and 1940 selected the forest as the primary route of their mechanized forces in the Invasion of France. The forest&#x27;s great size could conceal the armored divisions, and because the French did not suspect that the Germans would make such a risky move, they did not consider a breakthrough there, or considered that it would take at least 15 days for an army to pass through the forest. German forces, primarily under the command of Erich von Manstein, carried out the plan in two days, and managed to slip numerous divisions past the Maginot Line to attack France from the north, and rout the French forces. 
In May 1940 the German army crossed the Meuse, despite the resistance of the French Army. Under the command of General Heinz Guderian, the German armoured divisions crossed the river at Dinant and at Sedan, France. This was a crucial step in the push towards Paris, and France fell on 25 June 1940.

At the other end of the war, the Ardennes area came to prominence again during the Battle of the Bulge. The German Army, which had been forced to retreat for some time, launched a surprise attack in December 1944 in an attempt to recapture Antwerp and to drive a wedge between the advancing British and American forces in northern France. After a fierce battle the Allied forces blocked the German advance on the river Meuse at Dinant.In the postwar period, the Ardennes has become a weekend retreat that is popular among both Belgians and the neighboring countries. The tourist industry is extensive and varied in range of activities and type of accommodations.

<doc id="143710" wikidata="Q1058534" url="?curid=143710" title="Ultraman (1966 TV series)">
<text>is a Japanese &quot;tokusatsu&quot; science fiction television series created by Eiji Tsuburaya. Produced by Tsuburaya Productions, it is a follow-up to &quot;Ultra Q&quot;, though not technically a sequel or spin-off. Tsuburaya Productions produced 39 episodes (40, counting the pre-premiere special) that aired on Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) and its affiliate stations from July 17, 1966, to April 9, 1967. Its premiere topped the average rating set by &quot;Ultra Q&quot; and kept climbing each week, marking the show as a success. It was also the first Japanese television series to use a bidding system for commercial rights, allowing multiple third-party companies to sponsor the show. This was following TBS&#x27;s merchandising troubles with its predecessor.

Although &quot;Ultraman&quot; is the first series to feature an Ultraman character, it is the second installment in the Ultra Series, following &quot;Ultra Q&quot;. This is symbolised by the Japanese show opening with the &quot;Ultra Q&quot; logo exploding into the &quot;Ultraman&quot; logo. &quot;Ultraman&quot; and its titular hero became a major pop culture phenomenon in Japan, generating dozens of sequels, spin-offs, imitations, parodies and tributes. Ultraman went on to generate in merchandising revenue from 1966 to 1987 in Japan (equivalent to more than adjusted for inflation) and become the world&#x27;s third top-selling licensed character by the 1980s, largely due to his popularity in Asia.

A manga series of the same name serving as a sequel to the television series began publication in October 2011 and received an anime adaptation starting in April 2019. In May 2022, Toho released &quot;Shin Ultraman&quot;, a reimagining of the series directed by Shinji Higuchi.

==Premise==
The series follows the adventures of the Science Patrol, a special scientific team investigating and combating threats from aliens and &quot;kaiju&quot;. Unbeknownst to the team, fellow member Shin Hayata possesses the ability to transform into the giant alien superhero Ultraman in moments of crisis.

==Production==
===Development===
Due to the success of &quot;Ultra Q&quot;, Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) requested a similar themed show from Tsuburaya Productions Company (TPC), this time filmed in color and with the hopes of continuing the series with TPC. TPC founder Eiji Tsuburaya and writer Tetsuo Kinjo decided to recycle the barebones idea of &quot;Ultra Q&quot; about civilians and center the show on a team, tentatively dubbed the &quot;Scientific Investigation Agency&quot; (SIA), specifically designed to deal with monsters and supernatural phenomena. Tsuburaya and Kinjo repurposed unused ideas from &quot;Ultra Q&quot;, as well as the rejected outline for &quot;Woo&quot;. Tsuburaya had spent significant studio money to build his miniatures for the &quot;Godzilla&quot; films, and TPC was seeking a new project to repurpose and monetize those miniatures. 

The first iteration of Ultraman was named &quot;Bemular&quot; and had a human host in his late 20s named &quot;Officer Sakomizu&quot;, described as a &quot;tough guy&quot; in early drafts. Captain Muramatsu would have been the only SIA member to know his secret identity, and a female SIA member was added late in production. Pre-production and story layout began in December 1965 as &quot;Bemular: Scientific Investigation Agency&quot;. Writer Masahiro Yamada completed a sample teleplay titled &quot;The Birth of Bemular&quot; that featured an unused scenario originally written for &quot;Ultra Q&quot;. TBS producer Takashi Kakoi demanded that Bemular have a metallic complexion and be distinguishable from similarly designed monsters to avoid confusion. As a result, Tsuburaya and Kinjo discarded Bemular&#x27;s original design in favor of a humanoid appearance. The name &quot;Bemular&quot; was dropped for the hero but given to Ultraman&#x27;s first foe in the debut episode &quot;Ultra Operation No. 1&quot;.

In January 1966, the production&#x27;s title was changed to &quot;Redman&quot; to reflect the hero&#x27;s color scheme and was unanimously approved for production a month later. In this version, Redman lands on Earth as a refugee after invaders destroyed his home planet. Redman fuses with Sakomizu and together protect the Earth from giant monsters and alien invaders. This version also featured the &quot;Flashbeam&quot;, an early version of Ultraman&#x27;s transformation device the Beta Capsule, however, the Flashbeam version resembled a futuristic fountain pen. During the casting process, TBS suggested actors with Western appearances in order to appeal to overseas markets, however, most of the cast came from Toho. On March 22, 1966, the copyright offices approved the shows&#x27;s registration, now titled &quot;Ultraman&quot;. Each episode was produced on a budget of .

===Design===
The early Bemular version was originally conceived by Kinjo as an intergalactic reptilian creature that would enlarge itself to and come to the SIA&#x27;s aid. The early design was a cross between Garuda, a mythological Hindu/Buddhist guardian bird, and Tengu, a Japanese folkloric crow-goblin. Eiji Tsuburaya found the early designs to be &quot;too alien and sinister&quot; and requested that production designer Tohl Narita continue drafting additional designs as teleplays were being written concurrently. Narita took inspiration from the Greek concept of cosmos (order and harmony), in contrast to Narita&#x27;s monster designs for &quot;Ultra Q&quot;, which were rooted in the Greek concept of Chaos. Narita also drew inspiration from classical Greek art, ancient Egypt, the European Renaissance, and Miyamoto Musashi. Tsuburaya and Kinjo also gave their own input on Narita&#x27;s designs. To reflect Ultraman&#x27;s cosmic origins, his silver skin symbolized steel from an interstellar rocket and the red lining represented the surface of Mars. Narita&#x27;s assistant, Akira Sasaki, sculpted clays, but became concerned about the nose and mouth looking too human. They eventually decided on a brim-like nose that runs from the mouth to the top of the head like a dorsal fin, and applied flexibility on the mouth for speech. Early outlines had Ultraman capable of spitting fire and a liquid called &quot;silver iodine&quot;, but these ideas were dropped. A three-minute warning light called the &quot;Color Timer&quot; was added at the last minute due to the filmmakers feeling that Ultraman was too invincible, and also believed that it would invoke suspense and cheers from viewers.

===Filming===
To keep production costs from going over budget, the series was filmed on 16mm stock and optical effects on 35mm. This met the network&#x27;s requirement for making new episodes on a fast-paced production schedule, due to filming starting in March 1966 for July premiere. The production crew were separated into three teams, subdivided into separate live-action filming and special effects filming groups. TBS and TPC originally agreed to air &quot;Ultraman&quot; on July 17, but TBS delayed it by one week in order to cover the spot originally intended for the final episode of &quot;Ultra Q&quot;, which was pulled from the broadcast schedule due to not featuring any monsters. TBS also wanted to beat the release of Fuji Television&#x27;s similarly themed &quot;Ambassador Magma&quot;. Though production on &quot;Ultraman&quot; was proceeding well enough, it was falling behind to meet the premiere date. After meetings between TBS, Tsuburaya Productions, and sponsors, they decided to produce the &quot;Ultraman Eve Festival&quot;, a live TV special intended to introduce Ultraman to viewers that would air on July 10. This was also done to help the crew catch up and finish the premiere episode. The special was retitled &quot;The Birth of Ultraman: An Ultraman Premiere Celebration&quot;. Kunio Miyauchi, who composed the music for &quot;Ultra Q&quot;, was brought back to compose the music for &quot;Ultraman&quot;. The lyrics to the show&#x27;s opening theme music were written by Hajime Tsuburaya (credited as Koichi Fuji).

===Monsters===

Production designer Tohl Narita designed all of the show&#x27;s monsters, and sometimes deviated from their original descriptions. A majority of the time, the writers did not include any specific descriptions in the teleplays and left most unnamed. The names of the monsters were decided via staff meetings, where it would also be determined if the writer had created a creature that was capable or incapable of being filmed with the special effects technology available at the time. The monsters were sculpted and fabricated by Ryosaku Takayama, Akira Sasaki, and Ekisu Productions.

Haruo Nakajima, who played Godzilla for the first 12 films in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise, choreographed all the monsters&#x27; battles with Ultraman performer Bin Furuya and even played the monsters for episodes three and ten. Nakajima also had two cameos, one in episode 24 and one in episode 33 as a police officer. &quot;Ultraman&quot; featured new monster suits, as well as recycled suits from &quot;Ultra Q&quot;. Two Godzilla suits were recycled from Toho for the monster Jirahs, with the head taken from the Godzilla suit from &quot;Ebirah, Horror of the Deep&quot; and placed upon the body of the Godzilla suit from &quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla&quot;. The dorsal fins and parts of the suit were sprayed yellow and a large yellow frill was attached to disguise the connection of the head with the body. The show also marks the first appearance of &quot;Ultraman Zoffy&quot; in the finale &quot;Farewell, Ultraman&quot;.

==English version==

United Artists Television picked up the rights for &quot;Ultra Q&quot; and &quot;Ultraman&quot; in the fall of 1966, two months after the first episode of &quot;Ultraman&quot; aired. &quot;Ultra Q&quot; was dubbed but never broadcast in the United States due to American TV stations preferring color shows over black-and-white shows. &quot;Ultraman&quot; ran in and out of syndication until the early 1990s. UA-TV also syndicated &quot;Ultraman&quot; internationally. Peter Fernandez, Corinne Orr, and Earl Hammond provided the voices for the dub. Fernandez also wrote and supervised the dub.

Describing the process, Fernandez said: &quot;I had a Moviola, sometimes a projector, and I’d go back and forth over each line carefully and carefully, building the line to look like English.&quot; Fernandez also went on to explain that a grease pencil was used to mark scenes that needed to be dubbed, even if it were only a few lines. A loop of the film would be projected so that the voice actor could memorize his or her lines and see where the scene needed to be dubbed. The voice actors had to wait for a beeping signal before starting, Fernandez explained: &quot;So in the studio you hear “Beep… beep… beep…” then you talk, as if there is a fourth beep. Those beeps are drilled into me. They are two-thirds of a second apart. Later on, the film is reassembled and mixed with the original music and sound effects.&quot; The English dub was featured in the BCI Eclipse DVD release of &quot;Ultraman&quot;, as well as subsequent DVD re-issues from Mill Creek Entertainment.

==Home media==
===Japan===
In April 2013, Tsuburaya held a press conference announcing the new Ultra Series show and character, &quot;Ultraman Ginga&quot;, where they also announced that the original 1966 show will be given an HD remaster treatment in Japan. In July 2013, Bandai Visual released an HD transfer of &quot;Ultraman&quot; on Blu-ray titled &quot;Ultraman HD Remaster 2.0&quot;, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Tsuburaya Productions. Bandai Visual released the series on three separate box sets, each containing 13 episodes. The first box set was released on July 10, 2013, the second one on October 25, 2013, and the final one on January 29, 2014.

On November 25, 2020, Tsuburaya Productions and Pony Canyon released a 3.0 HD remaster of the series on Blu-ray titled &quot;Ultraman 55th Anniversary Ultraman Archives: Ultraman MovieNEX&quot;, suitable for large screen televisions. Composite technology EXA Quality Advanced Service (EQAS) was used to process the series to remove excess picture noise while retaining an appropriate level of graininess.

===North America===
BCI Eclipse Home Entertainment LLC officially released &quot;Ultraman&quot; on two separate DVD volumes in 2006 and 2007, licensed from then-rights holder Southern California-based Golden Media Group Inc. (via Tokyo-based UM Corporation). BCI&#x27;s first DVD release featured the first 20 episodes, while the second release featured the final 19 episodes, all presented uncut, unedited and re-mastered in color with stereo sound. These releases also featured the original Japanese audio and the English dub. When Navarre folded BCI Eclipse in December 2008, the series was shuffled over to Navarre&#x27;s other home video label, Mill Creek Entertainment. In June 2009, Mill Creek re-released the complete series set on September 29, 2009, in a four-disc set with the same special features from the previous release.

On July 10, 2019, Mill Creek Entertainment announced that it had acquired most of the franchise library from Tsuburaya Productions through Indigo Entertainment, including 1,100 episodes and 20 films. Mill Creek released the series on Blu-ray and digital on October 15, 2019, in standard and steelbook editions. Mill Creek released &quot;The Birth of Ultraman Collection&quot; on Blu-ray on July 10, 2020. It included the pre-premiere special and seven episodes from the 1966 series, which included the English dub. The Blu-ray featured artwork by Alex Ross (originally created for Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Ultraman&quot; comic) and was sold exclusively on DeepDiscount.

In July 2020, Shout! Factory announced that they had struck a multi-year deal with Alliance Entertainment and Mill Creek, with the blessings of Tsuburaya and Indigo, that granted them the exclusive SVOD and AVOD digital rights to the &quot;Ultra&quot; series and films (1,100 episodes and 20 film) acquired by Mill Creek the previous year. &quot;Ultraman&quot;, amongst other titles, streamed on Shout! Factory TV and Tokushoutsu in the United States and Canada.

==Post-release==
===Proposed sequels===
Due to the show&#x27;s success, a feature film titled &quot;Ultraman: Operation Giant&quot; was planned. Toshihiro Iijima was attached to write the script. The film was to be filmed in CinemaScope and was to introduce new characters, such as a self-sacrificing automaton built by the Science Patrol, the Baltans invading Earth with the help of a human scientist, a new subterranean monster named &quot;Morugo&quot;, and Ultraman was to be given a new sword weapon. A sequel series tentatively titled was also proposed; however, neither project ever materialized.

===Adaptations===
Harvey Comics Entertainment published two short comic book series based on Ultraman in 1993 and 1994. Bandai published the video game &quot;Ultraman&quot; for Super Famicom in 1990, and &quot;PD Ultraman Battle Collection 64&quot; for the Nintendo 64 in 1997. The games were released in Japan only. In 2011, a manga adaptation simply titled &quot;Ultraman&quot; began serialization in Shogakukan&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Hero&#x27;s&quot; magazine. It serves as a sequel to the television series. It was released on August 18, 2015, in North America by Viz Media, who had received the rights on February 18, 2015. The manga was adapted into a 3DCG anime of the same name and released on Netflix in April 2019. In September 2020, Marvel Comics launched a monthly series titled &quot;The Rise of Ultraman&quot;.

In May 2022, Toho released a reimagining of the series, titled &quot;Shin Ultraman&quot;, directed by Shinji Higuchi. Using motion capture technology, Bin Furuya, the original Ultraman suit actor, portrays the titular hero alongside Hideaki Anno.

===Legacy===
Since its debut, both the show and character became international pop culture phenomena, inspiring rip-offs, imitators, parodies, tributes, and a multimedia franchise centered around spin-off characters based on Ultraman. The series has been recognized by Guinness World Records for &quot;TV series with most number of spin-offs.&quot; Mark Schilling from &quot;The Japan Times&quot; called the series &quot;a rite of passage for Japanese boys (and a few girls) and their families&quot; since the series&#x27; debut and noted &quot;the series is as much a part of the national fabric as furikake (rice topping) and chopsticks.&quot; SciFi Japan called the 1966 series &quot;the gold standard of Japanese special effects television series.&quot; Ultraman has been parodied, tributed, and referenced in various media such as &quot;Ben 10&quot;, &quot;Ready Player One&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot;, &quot;Kyoei Toshi&quot;, and &quot;Ant-Man&quot;. Chris Kirkpatrick, Will Smith, and Guillermo del Toro have cited the 1966 series as one of the shows they grew up watching as kids. Del Toro named Ultraman and Pigmon as his favorite characters from the show and cited &quot;Ultraman&quot; as an influence on &quot;Pacific Rim&quot;.

<text>Lodestar is a British experimental progressive rock band, formed in 1996 by Heitham Al-Sayed (lead vocalist), John Morgan (drums) and Alan Haggarty (sound engineer) after they left Senser. They were joined by guitarist Jules Hodgson to write and record their self-titled debut album in 1996. Recorded at Monnow Valley Studios in Wales, the album was engineered and produced by Alan Haggarty &amp; Dave Eringa, and released on Ultimate Records.

The band released two singles and 1 album, and gigged across the UK and Europe from 1996 to 1997.

They were asked to join Tool on their European tour, as support for their album Aenima, including a support slot at the London Astoria.

The band split after a couple of years, and the members went off to pursue other projects, with Heitham, John and Haggarty all working with Senser again at various times.

Jules Hodgson went on to play for industrial bands Pig and KMFDM and moved out to the USA.

Around 2018–2019, Heitham, Morgan and Haggarty started conceiving ideas for a second album. Soon after, recording was underway.

This second album, called &quot;Zonen&quot;, was announced to be released in April 2024. It features Haggarty on bass and guitar, Heitham on vocals and Morgan on drums.

Prior to the release of Zonen, three singles have been released under the names of &quot;Bring Me The Head&quot;, &quot;Surrender To The Tide&quot; and &quot;Flame&quot;. The second album was eventually released on May 17, 2024, featuring 11 songs.

They are joined by Charlie Beddoes on bass, with Haggarty moving over to guitar.

<text>Mily Alexeyevich Balakirev ( , ; , ; – ) was a Russian composer, pianist, and conductor known today primarily for his work promoting musical nationalism and his encouragement of more famous Russian composers, notably Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. He began his career as a pivotal figure, extending the fusion of traditional folk music and experimental classical music practices begun by composer Mikhail Glinka. In the process, Balakirev developed musical patterns that could express overt nationalistic feeling. After a nervous breakdown and consequent sabbatical, he returned to classical music but did not wield the same level of influence as before.

In conjunction with critic and fellow nationalist Vladimir Stasov, in the late 1850s and early 1860s, Balakirev brought together the composers now known as The Five (a.k.a., The Mighty Handful)the others were Alexander Borodin, César Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. For several years, Balakirev was the only professional musician of the group; the others were amateurs limited in musical education. He imparted to them his musical beliefs, which continued to underlie their thinking long after he left the group in 1871, and encouraged their compositional efforts. While his methods could be dictatorial, the results of his influence were several works which established these composers&#x27; reputations individually and as a group. He performed a similar function for Tchaikovsky at two points in the latter&#x27;s careerin 1868–69 with the fantasy-overture &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, and in 1882–85 with the &quot;Manfred&quot; Symphony.

As a composer, Balakirev finished major works many years after he had started them; he began his First Symphony in 1864 but completed it in 1897. The exception to this was his oriental fantasy &quot;Islamey&quot; for solo piano, which he composed quickly and remains popular among virtuosos. Often, the musical ideas normally associated with Rimsky-Korsakov or Borodin originated in Balakirev&#x27;s compositions, which Balakirev played at informal gatherings of The Five. However, his slow pace in completing works for the public deprived him of credit for his inventiveness, and pieces that would have enjoyed success had they been completed in the 1860s and 1870s made a much smaller impact.

Balakirev began work on a second symphony, Symphony No. 2 in D minor in 1900, but did not complete the work until 1908.

==Life==

===Early years===
Balakirev was born in Nizhny Novgorod into a noble Russian family. His father, Alexey Konstantinovich Balakirev (1809–1869), was a titular councillor who belonged to the ancient dynasty founded by Ivan Vasilievich Balakirev, a Moscow boyar and voivode who led the Russian army against the Khanate of Kazan during the 1544 expedition (Alexey&#x27;s branch traced its history to Andrei Simonovich Balakirev who took part in the 1618 Siege of Moscow and was granted lands in Nizhny Novgorod). The legend of a supposed Tatar ancestor who was baptized and took part in the Battle of Kulikovo as Dmitry Donskoy&#x27;s personal khorunzhyi that circulated among fellow composers was made up by Balakirev and does not find any proof.

Mily&#x27;s mother was Elizaveta Ivanovna Balakireva (née Yasherova). The noble title was first granted to her father Ivan Vasilievich Yasherov who went a long way from a collegiate registrar to a State Councillor. The name Mily (either from Russian &quot;miliy&quot; — &quot;nice&quot;, or from Greek &quot;Milos&quot; — the island of the same name) was a traditional male name in her family. She gave piano lessons to her son since the age of four, and when he turned ten she took him to Moscow during the summer holidays for a course of ten piano lessons with Alexander Dubuque. She died in 1847 from smallpox.

Balakirev studied at the Nizhny Novgorod gymnasium. After his mother&#x27;s death, he was transferred to the Nizhny Novgorod Noble Institute of Alexander II where he studied from 1849 to 1853. Balakirev&#x27;s musical talents did not remain unnoticed, as he soon found a patron in Alexander Ulybyshev (Oulibicheff). Ulybyshev was considered the leading musical figure and patron in Nizhny Novgorod; he owned a vast musical library and was the author of a biography of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and other books on Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven.

Balakirev&#x27;s musical education was placed in the hands of the pianist Karl Eisrach, who also arranged the regular musical evenings at the Ulybyshev estate. Through Eisrach, Balakirev was given opportunities to read, play and listen to music and was exposed to the music of Frédéric Chopin and Mikhail Glinka. Eisrach and Ulybyshev also allowed Balakirev to rehearse the count&#x27;s private orchestra in rehearsals of orchestral and choral works. Eventually, Balakirev, still aged only 14, led a performance of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;. At age 15, he was allowed to lead rehearsals of Beethoven&#x27;s First and Eighth Symphonies. His earliest surviving compositions date from the same year—the first movement of a septet for flute, clarinet, piano and strings and a &quot;Grande Fantasie on Russian Folksongs&quot; for piano and orchestra. The first movement survives of an octet for piano, flute, oboe, horn, violin, viola, cello, and double bass and dates from 1855.

Balakirev left the Alexandrovsky Institute in 1853 and entered the University of Kazan as a mathematics student, along with his friend Pyotr Boborykin, who later became a novelist. He was soon noted in local society as a pianist and was able to supplement his limited finances by taking pupils. His holidays were spent either at Nizhny Novgorod or on the Ulybyshev country estate at Lukino, where he played numerous Beethoven sonatas to help his patron with his book on the composer. Works from this period include a piano fantasy based on themes from Glinka&#x27;s opera &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot;, an attempt at a string quartet, three songs which would eventually be published in 1908 and the opening movement (the only one completed) of his First Piano Concerto.

After Balakirev completed his courses in the late autumn of 1855, Ulybyshev took him to Saint Petersburg, where he met Glinka. While Glinka considered Balakirev&#x27;s compositional technique defective (there were as yet no music textbooks in Russian and Balakirev&#x27;s German was barely adequate), he thought highly of his talent, encouraging him to take up music as a career. Their acquaintance was marked by discussions, by Glinka passing several Spanish musical themes to Balakirev, and with Glinka entrusting the young man with the musical education of his four-year-old niece. Balakirev made his debut in a university concert in February 1856, playing the completed movement from his First Piano Concerto. This was followed a month later with a concert of his piano and chamber compositions. In 1858, he played the solo part in Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Emperor&quot; Concerto before the Tsar. In 1859, he had 12 songs published. Nevertheless, he was still in extreme poverty, supporting himself mainly by giving piano lessons (sometimes nine a day) and by playing at &quot;soirées&quot; given by the aristocracy.

===The Five===
The deaths of Glinka in 1857 and Ulybyshev the following year left Balakirev without influential supporters. Nevertheless, his time with Glinka had sparked a passion for Russian nationalism within Balakirev, leading him to adopt the stance that Russia should have its own distinct school of music, free from Southern and Western European influences. He had also started meeting other important figures who would abet him in this goal in 1856, including César Cui, Alexander Serov, the Stasov brothers and Alexander Dargomyzhsky. He now gathered around him composers with similar ideals, whom he promised to train according to his own principles. These included Modest Mussorgsky in 1858, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in November 1861 and Alexander Borodin in November or December 1862. Together with Cui, these men were described by noted critic Vladimir Stasov as &quot;a mighty handful&quot; (, &quot;Moguchaya kuchka&quot;), but they eventually became better known in English simply as The Five.

As an instructor and influence of magnetic personality, Balakirev inspired his comrades to improbable heights of musical creativity. However, he vehemently opposed academic training, considering it a threat to the musical imagination. It was better in his view to begin composing right away and learn through that act of creation. This line of reasoning could be argued as a rationalization to his own lack of technical training. He had been trained as a pianist and had to discover his own way to becoming a composer. Rimsky-Korsakov eventually realized as much, but nevertheless wrote:

Balakirev, who had never had any systematic course in harmony and counterpoint and had not even superficially applied himself to them, evidently thought such studies quite unnecessary... An excellent pianist, a superior sight reader of music, a splendid improviser, endowed by nature with a sense of correct harmony and part-writing, he possessed a technique partly native and partly acquired through a vast musical erudition, with the help of an extraordinarily keen and retentive memory, which means so much in steering a critical course in musical literature. Then, too, he was a marvelous critic, especially a &quot;technical&quot; critic. He instantly felt every technical imperfection or error, he grasped a defect in form at once.
Balakirev had the musical experience that the others in The Five lacked, and he instructed them much as he instructed himself—by an empirical approach, learning how other composers solved various problems by sifting through their scores and seeing how they addressed those challenges. While this approach may have been helpful for Balakirev, Rimsky-Korsakov writes, it was not so helpful for individuals completely different in nature from Balakirev or who matured as composers &quot;at different intervals and in a different manner&quot;.

Balakirev&#x27;s eventual undoing was his demand that his students&#x27; musical tastes coincide exactly with his own, with the slightest deviation prohibited. Whenever one of them played one of his own compositions for Balakirev, Balakirev would seat himself at the piano and show, through improvisation, how he felt the composition should be changed. Passages in other people&#x27;s works came out sounding like his music, not their own. By the late 1860s, Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov stopped accepting what they now considered his high-handed meddling with their work, and Stasov began to distance himself from Balakirev. The other members of The Five also became interested in writing opera, a genre Balakirev did not consider highly, after the success of Alexander Serov&#x27;s opera &quot;Judith&quot; in 1863, and gravitated toward Alexander Dargomyzhsky as a mentor in this field.

===Saint Petersburg Conservatory and Free School of Music===
The formation of The Five paralleled the early years of Tsar Alexander II, a time of innovation and reform in the political and social climate in Russia. The Russian Musical Society (RMS) and the musical conservatories in St. Petersburg and Moscow were all established at this time. While these institutions had powerful champions in Anton Rubinstein and Nikolai Rubinstein, others feared the influence of German instructors and musical precepts into Russian classical music. Balakirev&#x27;s sympathies and closest contacts were in the latter camp, and he frequently made derogatory comments about the German &quot;routine&quot; which, he believed, came at the expense of the composer&#x27;s originality.

Balakirev was outspoken in his opposition to Anton Rubinstein&#x27;s efforts. This opposition was partly ideological and partly personal. Anton Rubinstein was at that time the only Russian able to live on his art, while Balakirev had to live on income from piano lessons and recitals played in the salons of the aristocracy. At stake was a viable career in music as artistic director of the Russian Musical Society. Balakirev attacked Rubinstein for his conservative musical tastes, especially for his leaning on German masters such as Mendelssohn and Beethoven, and for his insistence on professional musical training. Balakirev&#x27;s followers were similarly outspoken. Mussorgsky, for instance, called the Saint Petersburg Conservatory a place where Rubinstein and Nikolai Zaremba, who taught music theory there, dressed &quot;in professional, antimusical togas, first pollute their students&#x27; minds, then seal them with various abominations.&quot; There was also a petty, personal side to Balakirev&#x27;s attacks. Rubinstein had written an article in 1855 that was critical of Glinka. Glinka had taken the article badly, and Balakirev likewise took Rubinstein&#x27;s criticism personally. Moreover, Rubinstein was of German and Jewish descent, and Balakirev&#x27;s comments were at times anti-Semitic and xenophobic.

The pro-Conservatory followers publicly called The Five &quot;amateurs&quot;—a justified charge, as Balakirev was the only professional musician of the group. To counteract these criticisms and to aid in the creation of a distinctly &quot;Russian&quot; school of music, Balakirev and Gavriil Lomakin, a local choirmaster, founded the Free School of Music (ru) in 1862. Like the RMS, the Free School offered concerts as well as education. Unlike the RMS, the Free School offered music education at no charge to students. The school also emphasized singing, especially choral singing, to meet the demands of the Russian Orthodox Church. Lomakin was appointed director, with Balakirev serving as his assistant. To raise funds for the school, Balakirev conducted orchestral concerts between 1862 and 1867, while Lomakin conducted choral ones. These concerts offered less conservative programming musically than the RMS concerts. They included the music of Hector Berlioz, Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt, Glinka and Alexander Dargomyzhsky, and the first works of The Five.

===Mature works and Prague visit===
Balakirev spent the summer of 1862 in the Caucasus, mainly in Essentuki, and was impressed enough by the region to return there the following year and in 1868. He noted down folk tunes from that region and from Georgia and Iran; these tunes would play an important part in his musical development. One of the first compositions to show this influence was his setting of Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s &quot;Georgian song&quot;, while a quasi-oriental style appeared in other songs. In 1864, Balakirev considered writing an opera based on the folk legend of the Firebird (a subject upon which Igor Stravinsky would later base his ballet &quot;The Firebird&quot;), but abandoned the project due to the lack of a suitable libretto. He completed his Second Overture on Russian Themes that same year (1864), which was performed that April at a Free School concert and published in 1869 as a &quot;musical picture&quot; with the title &quot;1000 Years&quot;.
In 1866, Balakirev&#x27;s &quot;Collection of Russian Folksongs&quot; were published. These arrangements showed great insight into the rhythm, harmony and types of song, although the key signatures and elaborate textures of the piano accompaniments were not as idiomatic. He also started a Symphony in C major, of which he completed much of the first movement, scherzo and finale by 1866. Even at this point, however, Balakirev had trouble finishing large works; the symphony would not be finished until decades later. He began a second piano concerto in the summer of 1861, with a slow movement thematically connected with a requiem that occupied him at the same time. He did not finish the opening movement until the following year, then set aside the work for 50 years. He suffered from periods of acute depression, longed for death and thought about destroying all his manuscripts. He was still able to complete some works quickly. He began the original version of &quot;Islamey&quot; in August 1869, finishing it a month later. Nikolai Rubinstein premiered the &quot;oriental fantasy,&quot; which Balakirev considered a sketch for his symphonic poem &quot;Tamara&quot;, that December.

Balakirev also intermittently spent time editing Glinka&#x27;s works for publication, on behalf of the composer&#x27;s sister, Lyudmilla Shestakova. At her behest, he travelled to Prague in 1866 to arrange the production of Glinka&#x27;s operas there. This project was delayed due to the Austro-Prussian War until the following year. The Prague production of &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot; under the direction of Bedřich Smetana reportedly horrified Balakirev, with Balakirev taking issue with the musical tempos, the casting of various roles, and the costumes—&quot;[i]t was as though Smetana was trying to turn the whole piece into a farce.&quot; &quot;[F]ive weeks of quarrels, intrigues by Smetana and his party, and intensive rehearsals&quot; followed, with Balakirev attending every rehearsal. Balakirev suspected Smetana and others were influenced by pro-Polish elements of the Czech press, which labeled the production a &quot;Tsarist intrigue&quot; paid for by the Russian government. He had difficulties with the production of &quot;Ruslan and Lyudmila&quot; under his direction, with the Czechs initially refusing to pay for the cost of copying the orchestral parts, and the piano reduction of the score, from which Balakirev was conducting rehearsals, mysteriously disappearing. Biographer Mikhail Tsetlin (aka Mikhail Zetlin) writes, &quot;It is hard to say, nowadays, whether Balakirev&#x27;s suspicions were fully justified or whether they were partly due to his own high-strung disposition.&quot; Regardless, though &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot; and &quot;Ruslan and Lyudmila&quot; were successes, Balakirev&#x27;s lack of tact and despotic nature created considerable ill feelings between him and others involved. Afterwards, he and Smetana no longer spoke to each other.

During this visit, Balakirev sketched and partly orchestrated an Overture on Czech Themes; this work would be performed at a May 1867 Free School concert given in honor of Slav visitors to the All-Russian Ethnographical Exhibition in Moscow. This was the concert for which, in his review, Vladimir Stasov coined the phrase &quot;Moguchaya kuchka&quot; (&quot;Mighty Handful&quot;) to describe The Five.

Balakirev encouraged Rimsky-Korsakov and Borodin to complete their first symphonies, whose premieres he conducted in December 1865 and January 1869 respectively. He also conducted the first performance of Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;The Destruction of Sennacherib&quot; in March 1867 and the Polonaise from &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; in April 1872.

===Waning influence and friendship with Tchaikovsky===

When Anton Rubinstein relinquished directorship of the RMS concerts in 1867, Balakirev was suggested to replace him. The conservative patron for the RMS, Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna, agreed—provided Nikolai Zaremba, who had taken over for Rubinstein at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory was also appointed, along with a distinguished foreign composer. The choice of Berlioz as foreign conductor was widely lauded, but Balakirev&#x27;s appointment was seen less enthusiastically. Balakirev&#x27;s uncompromising nature caused tension at the RMS, and his preference for modern repertoire earned him the enmity of Elena Pavlovna. In 1869, she informed him that his services were no longer required.
The week after Balakirev&#x27;s dismissal, an impassioned article in his defense appeared in &quot;The Contemporary Chronicle&quot;. The author was Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Balakirev had conducted Tchaikovsky&#x27;s symphonic poem &quot;Fatum&quot; and the &quot;Characteristic Dances&quot; from his opera &quot;The Voyevoda&quot; at the RMS, and &quot;Fatum&quot; had been dedicated to Balakirev. The appearance of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s article may have been calculated, as he knew Elena Pavlovna was due in Moscow, where he lived, the day the article was to appear. He sent two notes to Balakirev; the first alerted him to Elena Pavlovna&#x27;s planned presence in Moscow, and the second thanked Balakirev for criticisms he had made about &quot;Fatum&quot; just after conducting it. Balakirev&#x27;s immediate response was positive and enthusiastic.

This exchange of letters grew into a friendship and a creative collaboration over the next two years, with Balakirev helping Tchaikovsky produce his first masterpiece, the fantasy-overture &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. After &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, the two men drifted apart as Balakirev took a sabbatical from the music world. In 1880, Balakirev received a copy of the final version of the score of &quot;Romeo&quot; from Tchaikovsky, care of the music publisher Besel. Delighted Tchaikovsky had not forgotten him, he replied with an invitation for Tchaikovsky to visit him in Saint Petersburg. In the same letter, he forwarded the programme for a symphony, based on Lord Byron&#x27;s poem &quot;Manfred&quot;, which Balakirev was convinced Tchaikovsky &quot;would handle wonderfully well.&quot; This programme had originally been penned by Stasov for Hector Berlioz. Tchaikovsky initially refused, but two years later changed his mind, partly due to Balakirev&#x27;s continued prodding over the project. The &quot;Manfred&quot; Symphony, finished in 1885, became the largest, most complex work Tchaikovsky had written to that point. As with &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Fatum&quot;, Tchaikovsky dedicated the &quot;Manfred&quot; Symphony to Balakirev.

When Lomakin resigned as director of the Free Music School in February 1868, Balakirev took his place there. Once he had left the RMS, he concentrated on building attendance for concerts of the Free Music School. He decided to recruit popular soloists and found Nikolai Rubinstein ready to help. Elena Pavlovna was furious. She decided to raise the social level of the RMS concerts by attending them personally with her court. This rivalry caused financial difficulties for both concert societies as RMS membership declined and the Free Music School continued to suffer from chronic money troubles. Soon the Free Music School could not pay Balakirev and had to cut its 1870–71 series short. The RMS then scored the &quot;coup de grâce&quot; of assigning its programming to Mikhaíl Azanchevsky, who also took over as director of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1871. Azanchevsky was more progressively-minded musically than his predecessors, a staunch believer in contemporary music on the whole and Russian contemporary music in particular. For the opening concert of the RMS 1871–72 season, he had conductor Eduard Nápravník present the first public performances of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and the polonaise from Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;. This implicit recognition of Balakirev&#x27;s ideas made his own concerts seem unnecessary and redundant. Balakirev then hoped that a solo recital in his hometown of Nizhny Novgorod in September 1870 would restore his reputation and prove profitable. Neither happened—he played to an empty house, and the profits of the recital amounted to 11 rubles. Added to these professional troubles were the death of his father in June 1869, and the financial responsibility for his younger sisters resulting from it.

===Breakdown and return to music===

In the spring of 1871, rumors circulated that Balakirev had suffered a nervous breakdown. Friends who visited him found no trace of his former self; in place of his former vivacity, energy and drive, they found him silent, withdrawn and lethargic. Borodin wrote to Rimsky-Korsakov that he wondered whether Balakirev&#x27;s condition was little better than insanity. He was especially concerned about Balakirev&#x27;s coolness toward musical matters, and hoped he would not follow the example of author Nikolai Gogol and destroy his manuscripts. He took a five-year break from music, and withdrew from his musical friends, but did not destroy his manuscripts; instead he stacked them neatly in one corner of his house. In his mental state, he neglected to give up his post as director of the Free Music School, and the directors of the school were at a loss as to what to do. He finally resigned in 1874 and was replaced by Rimsky-Korsakov. Nikolai Rubinstein offered him a professorship at the Moscow Conservatory but he refused, stating that his musical knowledge was basically empirical and that he did not have enough knowledge of music theory to take on such a position. Financial distress forced Balakirev to become a railway clerk on the Warsaw railroad line in July 1872.

In 1876, Balakirev slowly began reemerging into the music world, but without the intensity of his former years. Stasov wrote Rimsky-Korsakov in July that Balakirev was busy composing his symphonic poem &quot;Tamara&quot; but still did not wish to see any of his old musical circle, &quot;for there would be talks about music, which he would not have under any circumstances. Nevertheless, he inquires about everything with interest...&quot; Balakirev also began sending individuals to Rimsky-Korsakov for private lessons in music theory. This paved the way for Rimsky-Korsakov to make occasional visits to Balakirev. By the autumn, these visits had become frequent. Also, Lyudmilla Shestarova asked him to edit Glinka&#x27;s works for publication, in consort with Anatoly Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov.

In 1881, Balakirev was offered the directorship of the Moscow Conservatory, along with the conductorship of the Moscow branch of the Russian Musical Society. Perhaps keeping in mind his experience with the Saint Petersburg branch of the Russian Musical Society years earlier, he declined the position. Instead, he resumed the directorship of the Free School of Music. In 1882, he finished &quot;Tamara&quot; and revised his &quot;symphonic picture&quot; &quot;1,000 Years&quot; two years later, retitling it &quot;Rus&quot;. In 1883, he was appointed director of the Imperial Chapel; Rimsky-Korsakov eventually became his assistant. He held this post until 1895, when he took his final retirement and composed in earnest. Between 1895 and 1910 he completed two symphonies, a piano sonata and two movements of his Second Piano Concerto, along with republishing his collection of folk-song arrangements.
While Balakirev resumed musical Tuesday gatherings at his home by the 1880s, it was music patron Mitrofan Belyayev who became a fixture of the Russian classical music scene at this time. Some composers, including Alexander Glazunov and Rimsky-Korsakov, initially attended these meetings. However, Balakirev&#x27;s modest gatherings eventually proved no match for Belyayev&#x27;s lavish Friday gatherings, nor could he compete with the commissions, prizes and performances that Belyayev offered. Balakirev did not take advantage of Belyayev&#x27;s services in these areas, as he felt that they promoted inferior music, and lowered the quality of Russian music. Musicologist Richard Taruskin asserted that another reason Balakirev did not participate with the Belyayev circle was that he was not comfortable participating in a group at which he was not at its center. The exception to this was Balakirev&#x27;s collection of folk songs, to which Belyayev bought the rights after the death of the songs&#x27; initial publisher. Otherwise, Balakirev remained without a publisher until 1899, when he met the Saint Petersburg music publisher J.H. Zimmermann. It was through Zimmermann&#x27;s efforts that Balakirev prepared several works for publication, including his two symphonies.

Unlike his earlier days, when he played works in progress at gatherings of The Five, Balakirev composed in isolation. He was aware that younger composers now considered his compositional style old-fashioned. Except initially for Glazunov, whom he brought to Rimsky-Korsakov as a prodigy, and his later acolyte Sergei Lyapunov, Balakirev was ignored by the younger generation of Russian composers.

Balakirev died on 29 May 1910 and was interred in Tikhvin Cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in Saint Petersburg.

==Personal life==
Balakirev apparently never married nor had any children since none are mentioned in biographical sources. In his earlier days he was politically liberal, a freethinker and an atheist; for a while, he considered writing an opera based on Chernishevsky&#x27;s nihilistic novel &quot;What is to Be Done?&quot;. For a while in the late 1860s he frequented a soothsayer to learn his fate with the Russian Musical Society. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote of these sessions, &quot;Balakirev, who did not believe in God, became a believer in the Devil. The Devil brought it about that subsequently he came to believe in God too ... [T]he soothsaying ... cast a terror upon him&quot;.

Following his breakdown, Balakirev sought solace in the strictest sect of Russian Orthodoxy, dating his conversion to the anniversary of his mother&#x27;s death in March 1871. The exact circumstances of that conversion are unknown, as no letters or diaries of his from this period have survived. Rimsky-Korsakov relates some of Balakirev&#x27;s extremes in behavior at this point—how he had &quot;given up eating meat, and ate fish, but ... only those which had died, never the killed variety&quot;; how he would remove his hat and quickly cross himself whenever he passed by a church; and how his compassion for animals reached the point that whenever an insect was found in a room, he would carefully catch it and release it from a window, saying, &quot;Go thee, deary, in the Lord, go!&quot; Balakirev lived as a recluse in a house filled with dogs, cats and religious icons. The exception to this reclusiveness was the musical Tuesday evenings he held after his return to music in the 1870s and 80s. He also became a political reactionary and &quot;xenophobic Slavophile who wrote hymns in honor of the dowager empress and other members of the royal family.&quot;

Rimsky-Korsakov mentions that some of Balakirev&#x27;s character traits were present before his conversion but became intensified afterward. This was true of his general intolerance of viewpoints other than his own, but especially so with his anti-Semitism. His attacks on Anton Rubinstein in the 1860s became petty and anti-Semitic, and Jews were not admitted to the Free School during his earlier directorship. However, it was after his conversion that he suspected everyone he disliked to be of Jewish origin, and that he hated the Jews in general because they had crucified Christ. He became belligerent in his religious conversations with friends, insistent that they cross themselves and attend church with him. &quot;All this medley of Christian meekness, backbiting, fondness for beasts, misanthropy, artistic interests, and a triviality worthy of an old maid from a hospice, all these struck everyone who saw him in those days&quot;, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote, adding that these traits intensified further in subsequent years.

==Music==

Balakirev became important in the history of Russian music through both his works and his leadership. More so than Glinka, he helped set the course for Russian orchestral music and Russian lyrical song during the second half of the 19th century. While he learned from Glinka certain methods of treating Russian folk song instrumentally, a bright, transparent orchestral technique (something he also learned from the works of Hector Berlioz) and many elements of his basic style, he developed and expanded upon what he had learned, fusing it satisfactorily with then-advanced Romantic compositional techniques.

Unfortunately, the protracted composition of several works robbed Balakirev of the credit for their inventiveness. Pieces which could have won success had they been completed in the 1860s and 70s made a much smaller impact when they were introduced much later in the composer&#x27;s life. This was because they had been overtaken stylistically by the accomplishments of younger composers, and because some of their compositional devices were appropriated by other members of The Five—the most notable example of the latter is Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Scheherazade&quot;, which was influenced by Balakirev&#x27;s symphonic poem &quot;Tamara&quot;. Another consequence was a tendency to overwork details, which robbed these pieces of freshness and inspiration, making them seem &quot;overdone&quot;.

Despite the protracted composition period, there was no discernible difference, especially in the two symphonies, between the sections completed in the 1860s and those written much later. Zetlin asserts that while there was no diminution of Balakirev&#x27;s creative talent, the reason for this lack of disparity was because Balakirev &quot;had ceased to evolve&quot; as an artist; he remained creatively at the point he had reached in the 1860s, &quot;and his newest works seemed thus merely an echo of the past.&quot;

===Influences===
Perhaps because Balakirev&#x27;s initial musical experience was as a pianist, composers for his own instrument influenced the repertory and style of his compositions. He wrote in all the genres cultivated by Frédéric Chopin except the Ballade, cultivating a comparable charm. The other keyboard composer who influenced Balakirev was Franz Liszt, apparent in &quot;Islamey&quot; as well as in his transcriptions of works by other composers and the symphonic poem &quot;Tamara&quot;.

Balakirev&#x27;s affinity with Glinka&#x27;s music becomes most apparent in his handling of folk material. However, Balakirev advances on Glinka&#x27;s technique of using &quot;variations with changing backgrounds,&quot; reconciling the compositional practices of classical music with the idiomatic treatment of folk song, employing motivic fragmentation, counterpoint and a structure exploiting key relationships.

Between his two Overtures on Russian Themes, Balakirev became involved with folk song collecting and arranging. This work alerted him to the frequency of the Dorian mode, the tendency for many melodies to swing between the major key and its relative minor on its flat seventh key, and the tendency to accentuate notes not consistent with dominant harmony. These characteristics were reflected in Balakirev&#x27;s handling of Russian folk song.

Since the musical views of The Five tended to be anti-German, it is easy to forget that Balakirev was actually well-grounded in German symphonic style—all the more impressive when it is remembered that Balakirev was essentially self-taught as a composer. His &quot;King Lear&quot; overture, written when he was 22, is not a symphonic poem in the vein of Liszt but actually more along the lines of Beethoven&#x27;s concert overtures, relying more on the dramatic qualities of sonata form than on extramusical content.

===Russian style: The Overtures===
With his First Overture on Russian Themes, Balakirev focused on writing symphonic works with Russian character. He chose his themes from folk song collections available at the time he composed the piece, taking Glinka&#x27;s &quot;Kamarinskaya&quot; as a model in taking a slow song for the introduction, then for the fast section choosing two songs compatible in structure with the ostinato pattern of the &quot;Kamarinskaya&quot; dance song. Balakirev&#x27;s use of two songs in this section was an important departure from the model, as it allowed him to link the symphonic process of symphonic form with Glinka&#x27;s variations on an ostinato pattern, and in contrasting them treat the songs symphonically instead of merely decoratively.

The Second Overture on Russian Themes shows an increased sophistication as Balakirev utilizes Beethoven&#x27;s technique of deriving short motifs from longer themes so that those motifs can be combined into a convincing contrapuntal fabric. As such it can stand on its own as an example of abstract motivic-thematic composition, yet since it uses folk songs in doing so, it can also be looked upon as making a statement about nationality. In this overture he shows how folk songs could be given symphonic dimensions while paying particular attention to the element of &quot;protyazhnaya&quot; or melismatically elaborated lyric song. This type of song is characterized by extreme rhythmic flexibility, asymmetrical phrase structure and tonal ambiguity. Incorporating these elements meant employing the tonal instability of folk song in larger structures by relying on tonal indeterminacy. The structure of this overture departs from the classic tonal relationships of tonic and dominant, coming close to the tonal experiments of Liszt and Robert Schumann.

Like his contemporaries in The Five, Balakirev believed in the importance of program music—music written to fulfill a program inspired by a portrait, poem, story or other non-musical source. Unlike his compatriots, the musical form always came first for Balakirev, not the extramusical source, and his technique continued to reflect the Germanic symphonic approach. Nevertheless, Balakirev&#x27;s overtures played a crucial role in the emergence of Russian symphonic music in that they introduced the musical style now considered &quot;Russian.&quot; His style was adapted by his compatriots and others to the point of becoming a national characteristic. The opening of Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; bears a close resemblance to the first theme of Balakirev&#x27;s Second Overture, while Borodin&#x27;s &quot;In the Steppes of Central Asia&quot; begins with a dominant pedal extending over 90 bars in the upper register of the violins, a device Balakirev used in his First Overture. The opening of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Little Russian&quot; Symphony in its original form also shows Balakirev&#x27;s influence.

===Progressive development: First Symphony===
Balakirev began his First Symphony after completing the Second Overture but cut work short to concentrate on the Overture on Czech Themes, recommencing on the symphony only 30 years later and not finishing it until 1897. Letters from Balakirev to Stasov and Cui indicate that the first movement was two-thirds completed and the final movement sketched out, though he would supply a new theme for the finale many years later. While he was waiting until the finale to incorporate folk material, he was anxious to incorporate a new Russian element, somewhat religious in nature, into the opening movement. The symphonic design for this movement is highly unusual. The slow introduction announces the motif on which the allegro vivo is based. While the allegro vivo is a three part structure, it differs from sonata form in having an exposition, a second exposition and a development instead of the usual order of exposition-development-recapitulation. This means that after the actual exposition, the thematic material is developed in two places, with the second exposition actually being an elaboration of the first. Formally, the process is one of progressive development, divided into three stages of increasing complexity. If this was how Balakirev had actually planned the movement in 1864, it would predate the late symphonies of Jean Sibelius in utilizing this compositional principle.

===Orientalism: &quot;Tamara&quot;===
Balakirev also further cultivated the orientalism of Glinka&#x27;s opera &quot;Ruslan and Lyudmila&quot;, making it a more consistent style. It appears in the &quot;Georgian Song&quot; of 1861, &quot;Islamey&quot; and &quot;Tamara&quot;. This style comprises two parts: a languorous vein of slow, sinuous melody with ornamentation and slow-moving harmonic progressions, contrasted with a more ecstatic vein marked by a perpetuum mobile at a fast tempo and rapid melodic contours over a slower-moving harmonic changes. This style on one hand evoked the mystery of the distant, exotic east with which Russia did not have direct contact, and on the other hand could also be used to refer to recently colonized areas of the Russian Empire.

&quot;Tamara&quot; is considered by some to be Balakirev&#x27;s greatest work as well as a touchstone of orientalism. Originally he intended to write a &quot;lezginka&quot; modeled after Glinka. However, he was inspired by the poetry of Mikhail Lermontov about the seductress Tamara, who waylays travelers in her tower at the Darial Gorge and allows them to savor a night of sensual delights before killing them and flinging their bodies into the Terek River. Balakirev evokes both the poem&#x27;s setting of the mountains and gorges of the Caucasus and the angelic and demonically seductive power of the title character. The narrative employs a wide musical range, with the composer supplying great subtlety within a satisfying structure.

<doc id="143713" wikidata="Q2750108" url="?curid=143713" title="Priory">
<text>A priory is a monastery of men or women under religious vows that is headed by a prior or prioress. They were created by the Catholic Church. Priories may be monastic houses of monks or nuns (such as the Benedictines, the Cistercians, or the Charterhouses). Houses of canons &amp; canonesses regular also use this term, the alternative being &quot;canonry&quot;. Mendicant houses, of friars, nuns, or tertiary sisters (such as the Friars Preachers, Augustinian Hermits, and Carmelites) also exclusively use this term. 

In pre-Reformation England, if an abbey church was raised to cathedral status, the abbey became a cathedral priory. The bishop, in effect, took the place of the abbot, and the monastery itself was headed by a prior.

==History==
Priories first came to existence as subsidiaries to the Abbey of Cluny. Many new houses were formed that were all subservient to the abbey of Cluny and called Priories. As such, the priory came to represent the Benedictine ideals espoused by the Cluniac reforms as smaller, lesser houses of Benedictines of Cluny. There were likewise many conventual priories in Germany and Italy during the Middle Ages, and in England all monasteries attached to cathedral churches were known as cathedral priories.

The Benedictines and their offshoots (Cistercians and Trappists among them), the Premonstratensians, and the military orders distinguish between conventual and simple or obedientiary priories.

*Conventual priories are those autonomous houses that have no abbots, either because the canonically required number of twelve monks has not yet been reached, or for some other reason. 
*Simple or obedientiary priories are dependencies of abbeys. Their superior, who is subject to the abbot in everything, is called a simple or obedientiary prior. These monasteries are satellites of the mother abbey. The Cluniac order is notable for being organised entirely on this obedientiary principle, with a single abbot at the Abbey of Cluny, and all other houses dependent priories.

Priory is also used to refer to the geographic headquarters of several commanderies of knights.

<text>Alsergrund (; ) is the ninth district of Vienna, Austria (). It is located just north of the first, central district, Innere Stadt. Alsergrund was incorporated in 1862, with seven suburbs. As a central district, the area is densely populated. According to the census of 2001, there were 37,816 inhabitants over 2.99 square km (1.15 sq. mi).

Many departments of the University of Vienna (main university), TU Wien and the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU) are located in Alsergrund. Until 2013 the University of Economics and Business (Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien) was also located in the 9th district, but eventually moved to the 2nd district. There are also many large hospitals, including the biggest in Vienna, the AKH (, &quot;General Hospital&quot;).

Alsergrund is associated with many notable names of Viennese art and science. It is the birthplace of Romantic composer Franz Schubert. Classic music composer Ludwig van Beethoven died here in his apartment at Schwarzspanierstraße 15. Berggasse 19 is the former residence and office of Sigmund Freud. It was Freud&#x27;s home from 1891 until his flight to England in 1938, and is currently the site of the Vienna Sigmund Freud Museum. Most of the patients Freud treated during the development of his theories of psychoanalysis visited him at his Alsergrund office.

In addition, the park in front of the Votivkirche, on the corner of Währingerstrasse and Schottenring, was named after Freud, in memory of his frequent visits there.


==Geography==
Alsergrund is situated in north-central Vienna. It covers making it the seventh smallest district of Vienna. North to South the district covers from the northernmost point of the Gürtel boulevard down towards the first district. The main east–west axis is located between Augarten Brücke and Zimmermannplatz (.
The district is delimited by: Gürtel in the west, the Danube Canal in the east, as well as the Maria-Theresien-Straße, Universitätsstraße and Alserstraße in the south. Neighbouring districts are Döbling in the north, Währing and Hernals in the west, Josefstadt and Innere Stadt in the south. In the east, Alsergrund is separated by the Danube Canal from Brigittenau and Leopoldstadt.

==Topography==
The natural topography of the district area has been covered by centuries of construction. Alesergrund&#x27;s lowest point at 163 meters can be found near Bauernfeldplatz, its highest near Michelbeuern (202 meters). The branches of the Danube played a significant part in shaping the general lay of the land.
The waterfront edge is still recognizable, through the waste ground between the Nußdorfer Straße, Währinger Straße, and Lichtenstein-Straße. There are also minor rivers: Wienerwald streams, all of which were bricked over in the 19th century. The main stream, the Als, used to cause frequent flooding.
The foothills of the Vienna Woods reach into Alsergrund. In the Middle Ages, these were used for vineyards.
==Sections==
The Alsergrund was formed, in 1850, from seven suburbs. The names of the suburbs have remained in section names but also in the awareness of many residents. In the northeast area of the district is the Althangrund, mostly with public facilities and infrastructure constructions built, such as the Franz Josef station, the Vienna University of Economics, the geosciences, mathematics, pharmacology and biology faculties of the University of Vienna, the Transport and postal and Telegraph Directorate. In the north is also the Spittelau with the incinerator Spittelau. South of Althangrund, joins the Rossau, which is mostly covered with residential buildings. Among the main installations include Rossauer barracks, the Servitenkloster, the Jewish cemetery. Even the Palais Liechtenstein belongs to Rossau, not northern Lichtental, a residential area in the parish.

In the south is the Alser suburb, whose southern part was added to the 8th district, Josefstadt. The district is established, in large part, with academic institutions such as the Old AKH and the Medical University of Vienna. In addition, in the suburb Alser, are the Vienna University and the St. Anna Children&#x27;s Hospital. In the east is the part of the Michelbeuern, whose southern part is taken almost entirely by the Vienna AKH, north of Himmelpfortgrund. The district is almost exclusively populated residential houses and also the Hera Sanatorium.
A breakdown of the district area is also in the Zählbezirken of the official statistics, in which the census district of the municipality are combined. The six Zähl areas in Alsergrund are Lichtental-Spittelau, Rossau, General Hospital, Nußdorferstraße-Volksoper, Liechtenstein Street, and University Quarter.

<doc id="143727" wikidata="Q1134615" url="?curid=143727" title="Violent Femmes">
<text>Violent Femmes are an American folk punk band from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The band consists of founding members Gordon Gano (guitar, lead vocals) and Brian Ritchie (bass, backing vocals), joined by multi-instrumentalist Blaise Garza (joined 2004), and drummer John Sparrow (joined 2005). Former members of the band include drummers Victor DeLorenzo (1980–1993, 2002–2013), Guy Hoffman (1993–2002), and Brian Viglione (2013–2016). Violent Femmes are considered to be an integral part of the then-underground folk punk and alternative rock scenes of the 1980s, and remain influential or inspirational to the subsequent movements, particularly on folk rock, indie rock, grunge, pop punk, emo, and the late 1980s and 1990s alternative rock scene.

Violent Femmes have released 10 studio albums and 19 singles during the course of their career. The band found critical acclaim with the release of their self-titled debut album in early 1983. Featuring many of their best-known songs, including &quot;Blister in the Sun&quot;, &quot;Kiss Off&quot;, &quot;Add It Up&quot; and &quot;Gone Daddy Gone&quot;, &quot;Violent Femmes&quot; became the band&#x27;s biggest-selling album and was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA. After releasing two more albums, &quot;Hallowed Ground&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Blind Leading the Naked&quot; (1986), the band&#x27;s future was uncertain and they split up in 1987 when Gano and Ritchie went solo. However, they regrouped a year later, releasing their fourth album &quot;3&quot; (1989). The follow-up album, &quot;Why Do Birds Sing?&quot; (1991), contains the fan favorite and concert staple &quot;American Music&quot;.

In 1993, founding member Victor DeLorenzo (percussion, snare drum) left Violent Femmes and was replaced by Guy Hoffman, who debuted on the band&#x27;s sixth album &quot;New Times&quot; (1994). Two more albums – &quot;Rock!!!!!&quot; (1995) and &quot;Freak Magnet&quot; (2000) – were released with this lineup before DeLorenzo rejoined the band in 2002 for what was to be a farewell tour. Following the commercial failure of &quot;Freak Magnet&quot;, Violent Femmes did not release any more studio albums for almost two decades, although a number of compilation albums were released in the early 2000s, along with a few one-off songs. Some controversy over the licensing of the band&#x27;s songs for commercial use led to an official break-up in 2009, though they re-formed in 2013 (shortly before DeLorenzo left Violent Femmes again), and have since released two more studio albums of new material: &quot;We Can Do Anything&quot; (2016) and &quot;Hotel Last Resort&quot; (2019).

==History==
===Early years and first album (1981–1983)===
Violent Femmes were founded by bassist Brian Ritchie and percussionist Victor DeLorenzo in 1981, joined shortly thereafter by lead vocalist and guitarist Gordon Gano. According to Ritchie, he came up with the name of the group as a fake band name when one of his bandmates questioned his assertion that his brother was also in a band. He and DeLorenzo liked the name, so they used it for the rhythm duo in which they played prior to Gano joining the group. In its early days, the band frequently played coffee houses and street corners. They were discovered by James Honeyman-Scott (of the Pretenders) on August 23, 1981, when the band was busking on a street corner in front of the Oriental Theatre, the Milwaukee venue that The Pretenders would be playing later that night. Chrissie Hynde invited them to play a brief acoustic set after the opening act.

The band released their self-titled debut album in 1983.

===Later years and brief split (1984–1992)===

After their debut album &quot;Violent Femmes&quot;, the band released &quot;Hallowed Ground&quot;, which moved the group toward a country music sound and introduced Christian themes. Mark Van Hecke produced the band&#x27;s first two efforts, but their third album, &quot;The Blind Leading the Naked&quot;, saw a change in the studio. This time, another fellow Milwaukee native, Jerry Harrison of Talking Heads, did the producing. It was more mainstream and pop-oriented, resulting in a minor hit with &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot;, originally by T. Rex. In 1985, Van Hecke ended his collaboration with the group and became a composer and producer in the rapidly growing video game industry. He would return later to produce two more albums for the group. The Femmes briefly disbanded, with Gano releasing an album in 1987, the result of a gospel side project Mercy Seat. Ritchie also released several solo LPs. The group came back together in late 1988, releasing &quot;3&quot;, a return to the band&#x27;s earlier, stripped-down sound. &quot;Why Do Birds Sing?&quot; was released in 1991 after the band signed to Reprise and featured another minor hit, &quot;American Music,&quot; which became a concert staple.

===Post-DeLorenzo years (1993–1998)===
In 1993, DeLorenzo departed the group to act and make solo records. Guy Hoffman, formerly of the Oil Tasters and BoDeans, was brought in to tour what was to become one of the Violent Femmes&#x27; biggest-selling records, the &quot;Add It Up (1981–1993)&quot; collection. Over the next nine years, the band, with Hoffman, recorded five full-length CDs and a handful of one-offs for motion picture soundtracks, such as &quot;I Swear It (I Can Change)&quot; from the &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot; soundtrack, &quot;Color Me Once&quot; for the soundtrack to &quot;The Crow&quot; and other compilation projects. The first full studio album with Hoffman on drums, &quot;New Times&quot; (Elektra Records), was released in 1994, and the band scored another minor hit with the song &quot;Breakin&#x27; Up&quot;. &quot;Rock!!!!!&quot; (Mushroom Records) was released in 1995 in Australia only, though it has since become available in the United States.

===Later years and reunion with DeLorenzo (1999–2006)===

&quot;Viva Wisconsin&quot;, a live album, was released in the United States in 1999 through Beyond Music and was followed by &quot;Freak Magnet&quot; in 2000. &quot;Something&#x27;s Wrong&quot; (2001), an album of unreleased studio tracks, covers, demos, and acoustic live performances, was released as an MP3-only album through eMusic. In 2002, Rhino Records repackaged the band&#x27;s 1983 debut album, along with demos and live tracks, to coincide with a 20th-anniversary reissue. DeLorenzo asked to rejoin for what was to be a farewell tour, thus reinstating the original lineup.

In 2001, they recorded a cover of the SpongeBob SquarePants theme song for Nickelodeon as a promotion for the show moving to prime time. In 2003, it was featured in the Complete 1st Season DVD as a special feature.

2005 saw the release of two collections of past work—a CD called &quot;Permanent Record: The Very Best of Violent Femmes&quot; on Slash/Rhino and a DVD, &quot;Permanent Record – Live &amp; Otherwise&quot; from Rhino, which showcases a concert performance from 1991, along with many of the group&#x27;s videos. The CD is the first release that recognizes all four musicians and their contributions on the same disc.

After touring in promotion of &quot;Freak Magnet&quot;, primary songwriter Gano decided that the band would no longer make new music, but would continue to play shows when booked. On New Year&#x27;s Eve of 2005, and for one show in January 2006, all four Violent Femmes members played together.

===Lawsuit and disbanding (2007–2009)===
In 2007, Gano angered Ritchie by selling advertising rights for the classic &quot;Blister in the Sun&quot; to Wendy&#x27;s.

Although nearly all of the band&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Blister in the Sun,&quot; credit Gano as the sole songwriter, Ritchie responded to the use of the song in the commercial by saying:

&quot;For the fans who rightfully are complaining about the Wendy&#x27;s burger advertisement featuring &quot;Blister in the Sun,&quot; Gordon Gano is the publisher of the song and Warners is the record company. When they agree to use it there&#x27;s nothing the rest of the band can do about it, because we don&#x27;t own the song or the recording. That&#x27;s showbiz. Therefore when you see dubious or in this case disgusting uses of our music you can thank the greed, insensitivity, and poor taste of Gordon Gano, it is his karma that he lost his songwriting ability many years ago, probably due to his own lack of self-respect as his willingness to prostitute our songs demonstrates. Neither Gordon (vegetarian) nor me (gourmet) eat garbage like Wendy&#x27;s burgers. I can&#x27;t endorse them because I disagree with corporate food on culinary, political, health, economic, and environmental grounds. However, I see my life&#x27;s work trivialized at the hands of my business partner over and over again, although I have raised my objections numerous times. As disgusted as you are I am more so.&quot;
Ritchie filed a lawsuit against Gano in August 2007, seeking half ownership of Violent Femmes&#x27; music and access to royalty accounting. Many speculated this would lead to the band&#x27;s breakup. However, on June 17, 2008, the band released a cover of &quot;Crazy&quot; by Gnarls Barkley, who had previously covered &quot;Gone Daddy Gone&quot;.

The band disbanded in 2009 as a result of Ritchie&#x27;s lawsuit against Gano.

===Reunion (since 2013)===
Violent Femmes reunited to perform at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2013. They performed there, the Bottlerock Napa Valley in May, and Milwaukee&#x27;s Summerfest in June. The band was also on the bill for Riot Fest, which took place in Chicago in September 2013.

Drummer Victor DeLorenzo said in March 2013 that he would be open to recording new material with the Violent Femmes, but on July 15, 2013, it was announced that Dresden Dolls drummer Brian Viglione would replace DeLorenzo as the band&#x27;s drummer. In a statement, DeLorenzo said &quot;It&#x27;s always hard to write a eulogy for a lost loved one. In this case, I sadly lament the loss of a dream and an ideal that was once Violent Femmes.&quot;

The Violent Femmes played three shows in Australia as part of the 2013/2014 Falls Festival, performing at Marion Bay on December 30, Lorne on December 31, and Byron Bay on January 2. On May 11, 2014, they performed at the Shaky Knees music festival in Atlanta, Georgia.

The band played several shows in Australia around the start of 2015, including the Woodford Folk Festival, the Sydney Opera House, and MONA FOMA festival. In the midst of these performances, they recorded their first new material in 15 years on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2014 in Hobart, Tasmania. These four songs were released on an exclusive four-song EP on clear 180-gram vinyl on April 18, 2015, for Record Store Day. The band then joined Barenaked Ladies and Colin Hay on a two-month tour in the summer of 2015.

In January 2016, Viglione announced via his Facebook page that he had &quot;handed in his resignation&quot; to the band, adding that he was &quot;grateful to have had the experience.&quot;

Later that month, the band announced that its first full album in 16 years, &quot;We Can Do Anything, &quot; would be released on March 22, 2016. Viglione is credited as the drummer on the album.

Drummer John Sparrow, who began playing cajón in the Femmes&#x27; backing band, the Horns of Dilemma, in August 2005, joined the band as its new drummer after Viglione&#x27;s exit. On February 23, 2016, he appeared with the band on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; to promote &quot;We Can Do Anything.&quot; On April 30, 2019, the band announced a new studio album, &quot;Hotel Last Resort&quot;, released on July 26, 2019.

In July 2019, the band returned to the East Side neighborhood of Milwaukee, in and around the street art destination Black Cat Alley, to film the music video for the single &quot;I&#x27;m Nothing&quot;.

The Violent Femmes are featured on the song &quot;Gotta Get to Peekskill&quot; by Dropkick Murphys that appears on the band&#x27;s 2023 album &quot;Okemah Rising&quot;.

Timeline
== Horns of Dilemma ==
In their shows, the Femmes employ a horn section called the Horns of Dilemma. For many years, it consisted of Peter Balestrieri, Steve MacKay on saxophones and Sigmund Snopek III on keyboards and other instruments. It was augmented by various musicians who the band invited to play with them. The band now uses local acquaintances, famous or otherwise, friends, relatives or associates of the band, particularly their road crew. Instrumentation varies widely and includes saxophones, trumpets, trombones, sousaphone, flute, clarinet, antique hunting horn, kazoo, and percussion. The group doesn&#x27;t back up the band in the way that a traditional horn section would; instead, they provide a free-form noise jam. When the band plays &quot;Black Girls&quot; or &quot;Confessions&quot;, the only direction given to the players is to play freely and as wildly as possible during certain sections. Currently, the leader of the Horns of Dilemma is Blaise Garza, who plays saxophone. Famous members have included John Zorn, Dick Parry, and the Dresden Dolls. Longtime band associates and employees who have played with the Horns include soundman Caleb Alexander and manager Darren Brown. Before becoming the band&#x27;s drummer, John Sparrow played cajón, starting in 2005. Various bassists stand in for Ritchie during &quot;Gone Daddy Gone,&quot; when he plays xylophone. These musicians are all considered members of the Horns of Dilemma.

<text>The English Football League Trophy, officially known as the [[Vertu Motors|Vertu]] Trophy for sponsorship reasons, is an annual English football knockout competition open to all clubs in EFL League One and EFL League Two and U-21 teams from the Premier League and the EFL Championship.

Launched in the 1981–82 football season as the Football League Group Cup, it was a replacement for the Anglo-Scottish Cup, which had been discontinued after the withdrawal of Scottish League clubs. It reconstituted as Associate Members&#x27; Cup during the 1983–84 season. The competition was renamed the Football League Trophy in 1992 after a reorganisation following the formation of the Premier League and again as the current &quot;EFL Trophy&quot; in 2016 due to The Football League changing its name to the English Football League.

The current competition begins with 16 regional groups, each containing 4 teams and divided between northern and southern sections depending on the clubs&#x27; geographic locations. The top two from each group qualify for the knockout stages before the two winners meet in late March or early April in the final at Wembley Stadium. Some Midlands and East Anglian clubs fluctuate between the north and south each season for every draw. Other details have varied over the years, including in some years inviting clubs from the National League, and holding a round-robin group stage prior to moving into knockout rounds.
The current champions are Peterborough United, who beat Wycombe Wanderers 2–1 in the 2024 final. The most successful club is Bristol City, who have lifted the trophy three times, in 1986, 2003 and 2015, and were finalists in 1987 and 2000.

==History==
A secondary football league competition was launched in the 1981–82 football season as the Football League Group Cup, which ran as an invitation tournament for 32 clubs from all four levels of the football league. The format was a group stage and knockout tournament. This format ran for two seasons. For the 1983–84 season the tournament was reconstituted as the &quot;Associate Members&#x27; Cup&quot;. The group stage was removed and open only to teams from levels 3 and 4 of the football pyramid. The group stage was subsequently reintroduced in 1985 and later removed in 1996. In 2016 the group stage was brought back. Between 2000 and 2006 teams from level 5 (step 1) of the football pyramid were invited to participate.

In 1992 the tournament rebranded as the &quot;Football League Trophy&quot;, coinciding with a reorganization following the decision of the First Division clubs at the time to form the Premier League.

In 2016 the competition rebranded to the current &quot;EFL Trophy&quot; after The Football League rebranding as the English Football League. The first season under the new name saw 16 Category One academies of Premier League and EFL Championship clubs join the competition.

In 2023 participating clubs received a £20,000 participation fee, with £10,000 per victory and £5,000 per draw in the group stage, and increasing prizes for the knockout matches up to £100,000 for winning the final.

==Formats==
===Football League Group Cup===
====1981 to 1983====
32 invited teams from the four levels of the football league were split into eight regional groups of four teams each, with three round-robin games played by each side. The eight group winners qualified for the quarter-finals, and the knockout stages were played as a single leg, with the game going to extra time and penalties if necessary. The final was played on the home ground of one of the two teams.

===Associate Members&#x27; Cup===
====1983 to 1985====
The 48 clubs of the Third and Fourth Divisions were split into North and South sections of 24 teams each. The first round had 12 knockout ties in each section, and the second had six. In each section, the two second-round losers with the &#x27;narrowest&#x27; defeats were reprieved and joined the six other clubs in the regional quarter-finals.

====1985 to 1992====
For the 1985–86 edition, 8 three-team groups were introduced in each of the two sections. Teams played one home and one away game and the group winners proceeded to the regional knockout stages. This was modified in the following season, with two teams qualifying from each group, resulting in an additional &#x27;round of 16&#x27; knockout stage in each section.

===Football League Trophy===
====1992 to 1996====
For a number of seasons in the early to mid-1990s, the competition ran with seven 3-team groups, two teams in each section receiving a bye into the knockout stages. This was a direct result of the folding of Aldershot and Maidstone United necessitating a reorganisation of the competition to accommodate fewer than 48 teams in the tournament.

====1996 to 2000====
The group phase was abolished for the 1996–97 edition. The regional sections were retained and 8 teams in each section received a bye to the second round.

====2000 to 2006====
For the 2000–01 season, 8 teams in level 5 (step 1) of the football pyramid were invited to participate in the tournament, resulting in 12 ties in each of the north/south sections in the first round, with only four teams in each section receiving a bye into the second round. The number of invitees increased to 12 from 2002–03, resulting in 14 first-round ties, and two teams in each regional section gaining a bye into the second round.

=====Invited teams=====
The teams from the Conference invited by season are as follows:
* 2000–01: Chester City, Doncaster Rovers, Dover Athletic, Hereford United, Morecambe, Rushden &amp; Diamonds, Scarborough, Yeovil Town
* 2001–02: Barnet, Dagenham &amp; Redbridge, Doncaster Rovers, Leigh RMI, Scarborough, Southport, Stevenage Borough, Yeovil Town
* 2002–03: Chester City, Dagenham &amp; Redbridge, Doncaster Rovers, Halifax Town, Hereford United, Leigh RMI, Morecambe, Scarborough, Southport, Stevenage Borough, Woking, Yeovil Town

* 2005–06: Accrington Stanley, Aldershot Town, Cambridge United, Crawley Town, Dagenham &amp; Redbridge, Exeter City, Halifax Town, Hereford United, Kidderminster Harriers, Morecambe, Stevenage Borough, Woking

====2006 to 2016====
For the 2006–07 tournament onward, the Conference team invitations were abolished. This resulted in the format reverting to 8 first-round teams in each section, and 8 sides receiving byes to the second round.

===EFL Trophy===
====2016 to present====
64 teams enter from Round One; all 48 teams from levels three and four of the football pyramid (League One and League Two), along with 16 category 1 Premier League and EFL Championship academy/under-21 sides. 16 regional groups of four teams split evenly 8 northern and 8 southern. Each of the groups contains one academy team. The top two from each group progress to the knockout stages; up to and including the quarter-final remains regionalised before becoming an open draw from the semi-finals onwards.

During the group phase, if the scores are level at the end of the match, then penalties are taken immediately without recourse to extra time. The winning team is awarded 2 points and the losing team 1 point. During the knock-out phase, up to but not including the final, if the scores are level at the end of the match the winner is decided by penalties. In the final, if the scores are equal after 90 minutes an extra 30 minutes are played and if still equal the winner is then decided by penalties.

The following academy teams have competed:
* Current (2023–24): Arsenal (since 2018–19), Aston Villa (since 2019–20), Brighton &amp; Hove Albion (since 2016–17), Chelsea (since 2016–17), Crystal Palace (since 2021–22), Everton (from 2016–17 to 2019–20 and since 2021–22), Fulham (from 2017–18 to 2020–21 and since 2023–24), Leicester City (since 2016–17), Liverpool (since 2019–20), Manchester City (since 2017–18), Manchester United (since 2019–20), Newcastle United (since 2017–18), Nottingham Forest (since 2023–24), Tottenham Hotspur (from 2017–18 to 2019–20 and since 2021–22), West Ham United (since 2016–17), Wolverhampton Wanderers (from 2016–17 and since 2018–19)

==Finals==
===Venue===
The final of the EFL Trophy is currently held at Wembley Stadium in London, the English national stadium. The final in 1984 was due to be played at the then Wembley Stadium, but owing to damage caused to the pitch during the Horse of the Year Show, it was moved to Boothferry Park in Hull. The Football League Group Cup finals were played at Blundell Park in 1982 and Sincil Bank in 1983.

==Records==
===Attendances===
The overall record attendance for the final is 85,021, set at the Wembley Stadium in 2019 by Portsmouth and Sunderland. The record attendance for the final at the original Wembley Stadium was 80,841, set in the 1988 final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Burnley. The record attendance for the final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff was 59,024, set in the 2007 final between Bristol Rovers and Doncaster Rovers. The 2020 and 2021 finals were played behind closed doors, but clubs raised money for charity by selling supporters virtual tickets.
 
The highest attendance for any game apart from the final came on 5 February 2013 for the Northern Area final, when Coventry City lost to Crewe Alexandra 3–0 at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry (they later won the away leg 2–0, going down 3–2 on aggregate), in front of a crowd of 31,054.

The lowest attendance in the history of the competition (excluding those affected by pandemic restrictions) came during the 2018–19 season when just 202 attended a Middlesbrough academy team&#x27;s 1–0 victory against Burton Albion in November 2018 at Burton&#x27;s Pirelli Stadium.

<doc id="143738" wikidata="Q156150" url="?curid=143738" title="Powys">
<text>Powys ( , ) is a county and preserved county in Wales. It borders Gwynedd, Denbighshire, and Wrexham to the north; the English ceremonial counties of Shropshire and Herefordshire to the east; Monmouthshire, Blaenau Gwent, Merthyr Tydfil, Caerphilly, Rhondda Cynon Taf, and Neath Port Talbot to the south; and Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion to the west. The largest settlement is Newtown, and the administrative centre is Llandrindod Wells.

Powys is the largest and most sparsely populated county in Wales, having an area of and a population of in . After Newtown (11,362), the most populous settlements are Ystradgynlais (8,270), Brecon (8,254), and Llandrindod Wells (5,602). The county is entirely rural, and characterised by multiple market towns and villages. The Welsh language can be spoken by 16.4% of the population.

The county is predominantly hilly and mountainous. To the west lie the Cambrian Mountains, where the River Severn and River Wye both have their source on the Powys side of the Plynlimon massif; together with their tributaries they drain most of the county. The southern quarter of the county is occupied by the Brecon Beacons (Bannau Brycheiniog) national park, and further north are two more upland areas, Mynydd Epynt and Radnor Forest. The only extensive area of flat land in Powys is the region northwest of Welshpool.

The county is named after the Kingdom of Powys, which was a Welsh successor state, petty kingdom and principality that emerged during the Middle Ages following the end of Roman rule in Britain. Powys covers the same area as the historic counties of Montgomeryshire, Radnorshire, and Brecknockshire.

== Geography ==

Powys covers the historic counties of Montgomeryshire and Radnorshire, most of Brecknockshire, and part of historic Denbighshire. With an area of about , it is now the largest administrative area in Wales by land and area (Dyfed was until 1996 before several former counties created by the Local Government Act 1972 were abolished). It is bounded to the north by Gwynedd, Denbighshire and Wrexham County Borough; to the west by Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire; to the east by Shropshire and Herefordshire; and to the south by Rhondda Cynon Taf, Merthyr Tydfil County Borough, Caerphilly County Borough, Blaenau Gwent, Monmouthshire and Neath Port Talbot.

The largest towns are Newtown, Ystradgynlais, Brecon, Welshpool, Llandrindod Wells and Knighton. Powys has the lowest population density of all the principal areas of Wales. Most of Powys is mountainous, and most roads and railways are relatively slow.

Just under a third of the residents have Welsh linguistic skills: Welsh speakers are concentrated mainly in the rural areas both in and around Machynlleth, Llanfyllin and Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant (where William Morgan first translated the whole Bible into Welsh in 1588) in Montgomeryshire, and the industrial area of Ystradgynlais in the southwest of Brecknockshire. In Radnorshire, the language survived into the 20th century west of Rhayader with a few native speakers from Nantmel parish surviving into the 20th century too. The 2021 census recorded that 16.4% of the population were able to speak the Welsh language, a decline from 18.6% in 2011 and 21% in 2001.

==History==

The county is named after the ancient Welsh Kingdom of Powys, which in the sixth century AD included the northern two-thirds of the area as well as most of Shropshire and adjacent areas now in England, and came to an end when it was occupied by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd of Gwynedd during the 1260s.

The uplands retain evidence of occupation from long before the Kingdom of Powys, and before the Romans, who built roads and forts across the area. There are 1130 identified burial mounds within the county, of varying styles and ages, dating from 4000 BC to 1000 BC, most of them belonging to the Bronze Age. Of these, 339 are scheduled monuments. Standing stones, most again dating to the Bronze Age, also occur in large numbers, 276 being found across the county, of which 92 are scheduled. From the Iron Age, the county has 90 scheduled hillforts and a further 54 enclosures and settlement sites.

Powys is served by the Cambrian Line and Heart of Wales line which offer connections to major towns and cities such as Swansea, Wrexham, Shrewsbury, Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Manchester, Cardiff, Aberystwyth, London and Telford. The county used to be served by key railways such as the Mid-Wales Railway, Oswestry and Newtown Railway, Tanat Valley Light Railway, Llanfyllin Branch, Leominster and Kington Railway, Swansea Vale Railway and the Hereford, Hay and Brecon Railway, all of which offered connections to South Wales, Hereford, Oswestry, North Wales and West Wales but have all since closed.

==Heraldry==

The gold in the county coat of arms symbolises the wealth of the area. Black is for both mining and the Black Mountains. The fountain is a medieval heraldic charge displayed as a roundel barry wavy argent and azure. It represents water and refers to both the water catchment area and the rivers and lakes. Thus, the arms contain references to the hills and mountains, rivers and lakes, water supply and industry.
The crest continues the colouring of the arms. A tower has been used in preference to a mural crown, which alludes to the county&#x27;s military history and remains. From the tower rises a red kite, a bird almost extinct elsewhere in Britain but thriving in Powys. The bird is a &quot;&quot;semé&quot; of black lozenges&quot; for the former coal mining industry, while the golden fleece it carries is a reference to the importance of sheep rearing in the county.

The county motto is: &quot;Powys – the paradise of Wales&quot; ().

==Government==

On 1 April 1974, Powys was created under the Local Government Act 1972. At first, the former administrative counties of Montgomery, Radnor, and Brecknock were districts within it. On 1 April 1996, the districts were abolished, and Powys was reconstituted as a unitary authority. There was a minor border adjustment in the northeastspecifically, the addition of the communities of Llansilin and Llangedwyn from Glyndŵr district in Clwydand with moving the border, so that rather than half of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant, all is included.

The first Lord Lieutenant of Powys was previously the Lord Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire. The Lord Lieutenant of Brecknockshire and Lord Lieutenant of Radnorshire were appointed as lieutenants. The present lord lieutenant is Shân Legge-Bourke of Crickhowell.

From 2024, Powys would be in the UK parliament constituencies of Brecon, Radnor and Cwm Tawe and Montgomeryshire and Glyndŵr, both of which extend out of the county.
