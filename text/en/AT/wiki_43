<text>Meringue ( , ) is a type of dessert or candy, of French origin, traditionally made from whipped egg whites and sugar, and occasionally an acidic ingredient such as lemon, vinegar, or cream of tartar. A binding agent such as salt, flour or gelatin may also be added to the eggs. The key to the formation of a good meringue is the formation of by denaturing the protein ovalbumin (a protein in the egg whites) via mechanical shear.

They are light, airy and sweet confections. Homemade meringues are often chewy and soft with a crisp exterior, while many commercial meringues are crisp throughout. A uniform crisp texture may be achieved at home by baking at a low temperature () for an extended period of up to two hours.

==History==

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; states that the French word is of unknown origin. The name &quot;meringue&quot; for this confection first appeared in print in François Massialot&#x27;s cookbook of 1692. The word &quot;meringue&quot; first appeared in English in 1706 in a translation of Massialot&#x27;s book. The first documented recipes recognizable as meringues are found in two considerably earlier 17th-century English manuscript books of recipes which give instructions for confections called &quot;white biskit bread&quot; in the book of recipes written in 1604 by Elinor Fettiplace () of Gloucestershire and called &quot;pets&quot; in the manuscript of collected recipes written by Lady Rachel Fane (1612/13 – 1680) of Knole, Kent. Slowly baked meringues are still referred to as &quot;pets&quot; in the Loire region of France due to their light and fluffy texture.

Meringues were traditionally shaped between two large spoons, as they are generally at home today. Meringue piped through a pastry bag was introduced by Antonin Carême.

==Types==

There are several types of meringue: the sweetened, beaten egg whites that form the &quot;islands&quot; of floating island (also known in French as ); the partly cooked toppings of lemon meringue pie and other meringue-topped desserts; and the classic dry featherweight meringue. Different preparation techniques produce these results.
* &quot;French meringue&quot;, or &quot;basic&quot; meringue, is the method best known to home cooks. Fine white sugar (caster sugar) is beaten into egg whites.
* &quot;Italian meringue&quot; was invented by the French chef Lancelot de Casteau in 1604. It is made with boiling sugar syrup, instead of caster sugar. This creates a much more stable soft meringue which can be used in various pastries without collapsing. In an Italian meringue, a hot sugar syrup is whipped into softly whipped egg whites until stiff, and until the meringue becomes cool. It will not deflate for a long while and can be either used for decoration on pie, or spread on a sheet or baked Alaska base and baked.
* &quot;Swiss meringue&quot; is whisked over a bain-marie to warm the egg whites, and then whisked steadily until it cools. This forms a dense, glossy marshmallow-like meringue. It is usually then baked.
* &quot;Vegan meringue&quot; is imitation meringue made using aquafaba with a small dose of vinegar and caster sugar. It holds similar characteristics to that of egg-based meringue, but it will quickly burn if torched or baked incorrectly. Another variation uses potato protein instead of aquafaba.

==Chemistry==

Protein distribution in egg whites is as follows: (54%) ovalbumin, (13%) conalbumin/ ovotransferrin, (11%) ovomucoid, (4%) ovoglobulins, (3.5%) lysozyme, and (2%) ovomucin. Ovoglobulins drive foaming, ovomucin is the main stabilization agent, and the remainder of the proteins interact to contribute to overall foaming and stability. When egg whites are beaten, some of the hydrogen bonds in the proteins break, causing the proteins to unfold (&quot;denature&quot;) and to aggregate non-specifically. When these egg white proteins denature (due to agitation from beating), their hydrophobic regions are exposed and the formation of intermolecular protein-protein interactions is promoted. These protein-protein interactions, usually disulfide bridges, create networks responsible for the structure of the foam and this change in structure leads to the stiff consistency required for meringues. The use of a copper bowl, or the addition of cream of tartar is required to additionally denature the proteins to create the firm peaks, otherwise the whites will not be firm. Wiping the bowl with a wedge of lemon to remove any traces of grease can often help the process.

When beating egg whites, they are classified in three stages according to the peaks they form when the beater is lifted: soft, firm, and stiff peaks.

Egg whites and sugar are both hygroscopic (water-attracting) chemicals. Consequently, meringue becomes soggy when refrigerated or stored in a high-humidity environment. This quality also explains the problem called &quot;weeping&quot; or &quot;sweating&quot;, in which beads of moisture form on all surfaces of the meringue. It can also happen if the meringue is undercooked (resulting in a puddle of liquid under the meringue) or overcooked (resulting in beading on top). Sweating is a particular problem for French meringues in which the granulated sugar is inadequately dissolved in the egg whites, and for high-moisture pie fillings.

==Compound interactions==
There are three main ingredients in a meringue recipe that interact to form the foam structure: egg whites, sugar, and cream of tartar or acid. The backbone of the foam structure is made up of proteins, amino acid chains. Egg whites provide the meringue with necessary proteins that form the meringue foam. The proteins are originally oriented in a tangled ball but must be uncoiled into strands; this is referred to as denaturation. There are two ways a protein can be denatured: through physical or chemical process. When forming a meringue the egg whites are beat until the proteins are denatured—a physical process. Also by beating the egg whites, air is incorporated into the protein structure creating an air–water protein mixture interface. The friction from beating the eggs adds heat to the process, which causes the proteins to increase in elasticity. As the proteins are being stretched during the denaturation process they are also coagulating together forming a protein network. After the denaturation process the egg whites will become six to eight times their original size. If the proteins are beat for too long they will become stretched out too far and become too weak to support the foam structure.

Cream of tartar, also known as potassium hydrogen tartrate, , is added to the egg whites before the denaturation process. Cream of tartar is an acid that is used to help stabilize and coagulate the proteins, which aids in a stronger protein network to trap air for the foam formation. Cream of tartar has a low pH to help bring the proteins near their isoelectric point to allow them to be denatured easier. The isoelectric point is a specific pH where a molecule, in this case protein, has no net electrical charge. The electrical charge on a protein would normally hold the protein together in its coiled clump.

The cream of tartar also acts as a catalyst affecting the sugar structure. Sucrose is a disaccharide made up of glucose and fructose. Cream of tartar inverts the sugar during the baking process, meaning the molecule is split into two parts containing glucose and fructose. This prevents the sugar from recrystallizing and giving the meringue a gritty, undesirable texture.

Sugar is the final ingredient that is used to help form and stabilize the foam structure. Sugar is hydrophilic, extracting water out of the egg whites. This will lighten the protein network, allowing the foam to be stronger and more elastic. The sugar dissolves in the protein network but does not become part of the protein network. The sugar must be added slowly to the egg whites, while continuously mixing. If it is added all at once, it will not be evenly distributed, causing the protein network to collapse due to the weight of the sugar in one area of the meringue.

After a strong protein network has formed a complete foam, the meringue is ready to be baked. Adding heat to the mixture is the final step to strengthen the foam structure. The meringue must be baked at a low temperature for a long period of time. This allows the proteins to finish coagulating, strengthening the meringue evenly throughout. If the proteins are not baked evenly, the bottom of the meringue will not be able to support the structural weight, causing the meringue to collapse. The heat causes the air bubbles to expand, creating an airier structure. The water in the structure evaporates, causing the meringue to become lighter with a stronger foam structure. It is important to not evaporate all of the water out of the meringue, as some water is necessary to hold the foam together.

==Uses==

===Cookies===
Meringue cookies are baked at a very low heat for a long time. Another name for them is &quot;forgotten cookies&quot;, as they can be left in an oven for a long time after the cooking is done. They are not supposed to become tan at all, but they need to be very crisp and dry. They will keep for at least a week if stored in an airtight container.

===Desserts===
Meringue can be used as the basis for various desserts, including baked Alaska, , , Esterházy torte, Eton mess, floating island, key lime pie, Kyiv cake, lemon meringue pie, macarons, , pavlova, Queen of Puddings, sans rival, silvana, , turrón, and . In some recipes, the meringue may be cooked at a higher temperature for a shorter amount of time, resulting in a soft meringue with slightly browned peaks on top. Meringue by itself is also a dessert called &quot;meringue kisses&quot;.
In Switzerland, meringues are often associated with Gruyère cream.

Another dish is , which consists of shortbread layered with meringue and lemon curd, topped off with drizzled lemon glaze. Variations include assorted fruits such as raspberries, peaches, mangoes, cherries, strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, pineapple, papayas, honeydew, oranges, and cantaloupe.

===Embellishment===
Meringue may be used for embellishment. It can be formed into whimsical shapes, such as mushrooms, or piped into a crisp basket that is baked and filled with cake, fruit, or flowers.

==Shelf life==
Meringue is not a stable structure and has a short shelf life of about two weeks if stored properly. Meringue is a hygroscopic food, thus it absorbs water from the air. The high sugar concentration in the meringue absorbs moisture from the air and will cause the meringue to become soft and chewy. The more water that is absorbed, the heavier the meringue becomes. After enough water is absorbed, the meringue will become too heavy for the foam structure to support itself, and it will start to collapse. Meringue is so susceptible to absorbing water that a rainy day may disrupt the foam structure formation and make it impossible to form a meringue.

Storing meringues in an airtight container will prevent humidity from affecting the sugar. It is also recommended to store the meringue in a cooler area. If the meringue is stored in these conditions, its shelf life will be about two weeks. To extend the shelf life up to about three months, the meringue can be stored in the freezer. The colder temperatures in the freezer decrease the humidity. The meringue should still be stored in an airtight container, preventing water from affecting the meringue.

==Nutritional content==
The principal nutritional components are protein from the egg whites and simple carbohydrates from the refined sugar.

<doc id="142216" wikidata="Q1752915" url="?curid=142216" title="Trifluoperazine">
<text>Trifluoperazine, marketed under the brand name Stelazine among others, is a typical antipsychotic primarily used to treat schizophrenia. It may also be used short term in those with generalized anxiety disorder but is less preferred to benzodiazepines. It is of the phenothiazine chemical class. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1959.

== Medical uses ==
===Schizophrenia===
Trifluoperazine is an effective antipsychotic for people with schizophrenia condition. There is low-quality evidence that trifluoperazine increases the chance of being improved when compared to placebo when people are followed up for 19 weeks. There is low-quality evidence that trifluoperazine reduces the risk of relapse when compared with placebo when people are followed for 5 months. As of 2014 there was no good evidence for a difference between trifluoperazine and placebo with respect to the risk of experiencing intensified symptoms over a 16-week period nor in reducing significant agitation or distress.

There is no good evidence that trifluoperazine is more effective for schizophrenia than lower-potency antipsychotics like chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, thioridazine and levomepromazine, but trifluoperazine appears to cause more adverse effects than these drugs.

===Other===
It appears to be effective for people with generalized anxiety disorder but the benefitrisk ratio was unclear as of 2005.

It has been experimentally used as a drug to kill eukaryotic pathogens in humans.

== Side effects ==
Its use in many parts of the world has declined because of highly frequent and severe early and late tardive dyskinesia, a type of extrapyramidal symptom. The annual development rate of tardive dyskinesia may be as high as 4%.

A 2004 meta-analysis of the studies on trifluoperazine found that it is more likely than placebo to cause extrapyramidal side effects such as akathisia, dystonia, and Parkinsonism. It is also more likely to cause somnolence and anticholinergic side effects such as red eye and xerostomia (dry mouth). All antipsychotics can cause the rare and sometimes fatal neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Trifluoperazine can lower the seizure threshold. The antimuscarinic action of trifluoperazine can cause excessive dilation of the pupils (mydriasis), which increases the chances of patients with hyperopia developing glaucoma.

== Contraindications ==
Trifluoperazine is contraindicated in CNS depression, coma, and blood dyscrasias. Trifluoperazine should be used with caution in patients suffering from renal or hepatic impairment.

== Mechanism of action==
Trifluoperazine has central antiadrenergic, antidopaminergic, and minimal anticholinergic effects. It is believed to work by blockading dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways, relieving or minimizing such symptoms of schizophrenia as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thought and speech. It also has antihistaminergic properties (H1 Ki = 17.5).

== Names ==
Brand names include Eskazinyl, Eskazine, Jatroneural, Modalina, Sizonil, Stelazine, Stilizan, Terfluzine, Trifluoperaz and Triftazin.

In the United Kingdom and some other countries, trifluoperazine is sold and marketed under the brand &#x27;Stelazine&#x27;.

The drug is sold as tablet, liquid and &#x27;Trifluoperazine-injectable USP&#x27; for deep intramuscular short-term use.

In the past, trifluoperazine was used in fixed combinations with the MAO inhibitor (antidepressant) tranylcypromine (tranylcypromine/trifluoperazine) to attenuate the strong stimulating effects of this antidepressant. This combination was sold under the brand name Jatrosom N, Stelapar, Parstelin, among others. It remained available in Italy under the brand name Parmodalin (10 mg of tranylcypromine and 1 mg of trifluoperazine) until its discontinuation in 2019.

Likewise, a combination with amobarbital (potent sedative/hypnotic agent) for the amelioration of psychoneurosis and insomnia existed under the brand name Jalonac.

<doc id="142219" wikidata="Q1682792" url="?curid=142219" title="Educating Rita">
<text>Educating Rita is a stage comedy by British playwright Willy Russell. It is a play for two actors set entirely in the office of an Open University tutor.

Commissioned by the Royal Shakespeare Company, &quot;Educating Rita&quot; premièred at The Warehouse, London, in June 1980 starring Julie Walters and Mark Kingston. The play was directed by Mike Ockrent.

==Plot summary==
The plays follows the relationship between a 26-year-old Liverpudlian working class hairdresser and Frank, a middle-aged university lecturer, during the course of a year. In the play Frank has no surname, but when the film was made he became Dr. Frank Bryant.

Susan (who initially calls herself Rita), dissatisfied with the routine of her work and social life, seeks inner growth by signing up for and attending an Open University course in English Literature. The play opens as &#x27;Rita&#x27; meets her tutor, Frank, for the first time. Frank is a middle-aged, alcoholic career academic who has taken on the tutorship to pay for his drink. The two have an immediate and profound effect on one another; Frank is impressed by Susan&#x27;s verve and earnestness and is forced to re-examine his attitudes and position in life; Susan finds Frank&#x27;s tutelage opens doors to a bohemian lifestyle and a new self-confidence. However, Frank&#x27;s bitterness and cynicism return as he notices Susan beginning to adopt the pretensions of the university culture he despises. Susan becomes disillusioned by a friend&#x27;s attempted suicide and realises that her new social niche is rife with the same dishonesty and superficiality she had previously sought to escape. The play ends as Frank, sent to Australia on a sabbatical, welcomes the possibilities of the change.

==Themes==
The play deals with the concept of freedom, change, Britain&#x27;s class system, the shortcomings of institutional education, and the nature of self-development and of personal relationships. The play borrows from the 1913 George Bernard Shaw play &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, itself based upon archetypes from Greek myth.

==Film adaptation==

The play was adapted by Russell for a 1983 film with Michael Caine and Julie Walters, directed by Lewis Gilbert.

==Radio adaptation==
The play was adapted by Russell for radio in 2009. It starred Bill Nighy and Laura Dos Santos directed by Kirsty Williams, and was a 90-minute play broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Boxing Day 2009.

==Revivals==
In 1987, Laurie Metcalf starred as Rita in a production Off-Broadway at the Westside Theatre produced by the Steppenwolf Theater Company.

From June to July 2001, the Williamstown Theatre Festival mounted a production of Educating Rita at the Nikos Stage starring Jacqueline McKenzie as Rita and Edward Herrmann as Frank. The production was directed by Bruce Paltrow and was critically acclaimed with critics touting McKenzie&#x27;s performance as &quot;wonderfully beguiling and irrepressible...one of the best performances of the year&quot;.

From 26 March to 8 May 2010, as part of the Willy Russell season at the Menier Chocolate Factory, Laura Dos Santos reprised her radio performance on stage as Rita alongside Larry Lamb as Frank. This was the production&#x27;s first London West End revival. This production transferred to the Trafalgar Studios in London&#x27;s West End from 8 July to 30 October 2010, produced by Sonia Friedman. Laura Dos Santos reprised her radio and Menier Chocolate Factory performance as Rita, and Frank was played by renowned actor Tim Pigott-Smith. Like the Willy Russell season at the Menier Chocolate Factory, the production ran in repertory alongside &quot;Shirley Valentine&quot; starring Meera Syal. A UK tour played in 2012, starring Claire Sweeney and Matthew Kelly as Rita and Frank respectively.

A 35th anniversary production was staged at Liverpool Playhouse from 6 February to 7 March 2015, starring Leanne Best as Rita and Con O&#x27;Neill as Frank, directed by Gemma Bodinetz. The same year the Chichester Festival staged a production with Lenny Henry and Lashana Lynch as Frank and Rita.

==Awards and nominations==
The original production received the 1980 Olivier Award nomination for Comedy Performance of the Year for Julie Walters and won for Comedy of the Year.

<doc id="142223" wikidata="Q449016" url="?curid=142223" title="DSV Alvin">
<text>Alvin (DSV-2) is a crewed deep-ocean research submersible owned by the United States Navy and operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) of Woods Hole, Massachusetts. The original vehicle was built by General Mills&#x27; Electronics Group in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Named to honor the prime mover and creative inspiration for the vehicle, Allyn Vine, &quot;Alvin&quot; was commissioned on June 5, 1964.

The submersible is launched from the deep submergence support vessel , which is also owned by the U.S. Navy and operated by WHOI. The submersible has made more than 5,200 dives, carrying two scientists and a pilot, observing the lifeforms that must cope with super-pressures and move about in total darkness, as well as exploring the wreck of &quot;Titanic&quot;. Research conducted by &quot;Alvin&quot; has been featured in nearly 2,000 scientific papers.

==Design==
&quot;Alvin&quot; was designed as a replacement for bathyscaphes and other less maneuverable oceanographic vehicles. Its more nimble design was made possible in part by the development of syntactic foam, which is buoyant and yet strong enough to serve as a structural material at great depths.

The vessel weighs 17 tons. It allows for two scientists and one pilot to dive for up to nine hours at . The submersible features two robotic arms and can be fitted with mission-specific sampling and experimental gear. The plug hatch of the vessel is in diameter and somewhat thicker than the thick titanium sphere pressure hull; it is held in place by the pressure of the water above it.

In an emergency, if previous versions of &quot;Alvin&quot; were stuck underwater with occupants inside, an upper part of the submersible including the titanium sphere could be released using controls inside the hull. This would then rise to the surface uncontrolled. The current version of the vehicle uses releasable weights and emergency releases on jettisonable equipment. 

Harold E. Froehlich was one of the principal designers of &quot;Alvin&quot;.

== History ==

=== Early career ===
&quot;Alvin&quot;, first of its ship class of deep submergence vehicle (DSV), was built to dive to . Each of the &quot;Alvin-class&quot; DSVs have different depth capabilities. However, &quot;Alvin&quot; is the only one seconded to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), with the others staying with the United States Navy.

&quot;Alvin&quot;s first deep sea tests took place off Andros Island, the Bahamas, where it made a successful 12-hour, uncrewed tethered test dive. On July 20, 1965 &quot;Alvin&quot; made its first crewed dive for the Navy to obtain certification. On March 17, 1966, &quot;Alvin&quot; was used to locate a submerged 1.45-megaton hydrogen bomb lost in a United States Air Force midair accident over Palomares, Spain. The bomb, found resting on a steep slope nearly deep, was located by &quot;Alvin&quot; but the submersible had difficulty raising it up, initially causing it to fall deeper to . The bomb was eventually raised intact on April 7 by a Navy CURV-I and the experience gained by the &quot;Alvin&quot; crew&#x27;s 34 dives with over 220 hours logged led to new improvements to the vehicle&#x27;s navigations systems.
On July 6, 1967, the &quot;Alvin&quot; was attacked by a swordfish during dive 202. The swordfish became trapped in the &quot;Alvin&quot;s skin. The attack took place at below the surface. The fish was recovered at the surface and cooked for dinner. During Dive 209, on September 24, 1968 &quot;Alvin&quot; found an F6F Hellcat, #42782, 125 miles southeast of Nantucket. The aircraft had ditched September 30, 1944 during carrier qualifications, with the pilot surviving.

=== Sinking ===
&quot;Alvin&quot;, aboard the Navy tender ship &quot;Lulu&quot;, was lost as it was being transported on October 26, 1968. &quot;Lulu&quot;, a vessel created from a pair of decommissioned U.S. Navy pontoon boats with a support structure added on, was lowering &quot;Alvin&quot; over the side when two steel cables snapped. There were three crew members aboard &quot;Alvin&quot; at the time, and the hatch was open. Situated between the pontoons with no deck underneath, &quot;Alvin&quot; entered the water and rapidly began to sink. The three crew members managed to escape, but &quot;Alvin&quot; flooded and sank in of water in the Atlantic Ocean at approximately , about south of Nantucket Island.

Severe weather prevented the recovery of &quot;Alvin&quot; throughout late 1968, but it was photographed at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean in June 1969 by a sled towed by USS &quot;Mizar&quot;. &quot;Alvin&quot; was found to be upright and appeared intact except for damage to the stern. It was decided to attempt recovery; although no object of &quot;Alvin&quot;″s size had ever been recovered from a depth of , recovery was &quot;deemed to be within the state of the art&quot;. In August 1969, the &quot;Aluminaut&quot;, a DSV built by Reynolds Metals Company, descended to &quot;Alvin&quot; but had trouble attaching the required lines, and side effects from Hurricane Camille were producing worsening weather, causing the team to return to Woods Hole to regroup. The second attempt started on August 27, and &quot;Aluminaut&quot; was able to secure a line and safety slings on &quot;Alvin&quot;, and wrapped a prefabricated nylon net around its hull, allowing it to be hauled up by &quot;Mizar&quot;. &quot;Alvin&quot; was towed, submerged at , at a speed of , back to Woods Hole.

=== Post-sinking refit ===

In 1973, &quot;Alvin&quot;″s pressure hull was replaced by a newer titanium pressure hull. The new hull extended the submersible&#x27;s depth rating.

===Mid-Atlantic Ridge===
With a new, stronger pressure hull &quot;Alvin&quot; could now reach the floor of the rift valley of this seafloor spreading center. In the summer of 1974 American and French scientists joined in Project FAMOUS to explore the creation of new sea floor at this spreading center. The French provided submersibles &quot;Archimède&quot; and &quot;CYANA&quot;. A total of forty-four dives were completed that succeeded in defining the crustal accretion zone in the floor of the rift valley.

===Hydrothermal vents===

Marine geologists using &quot;Alvin&quot; in the Pacific Ocean discovered deep-sea hydrothermal vents and associated biologic communities during two expeditions to ocean spreading centers. In 1977 scientists in &quot;Alvin&quot; discovered low temperature (~20 °C) vents on the Galapagos spreading center east of those same islands. During the RISE expedition in 1979 scientists using &quot;Alvin&quot; discovered high temperature vents (380 °C) popularly known as ‘black smokers’ on the crest of the East Pacific Rise at 21° N. These discoveries revealed deep-sea ecosystems that exist without sunlight and are based on chemosynthesis.

===Exploration of RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;===
&quot;Alvin&quot; was involved in the exploration of the wreckage of in 1986. Launched from her support ship , she carried Dr. Robert Ballard and two companions to the wreckage of the White Star Liner &quot;Titanic,&quot; which sank in 1912 after striking an iceberg while crossing the North Atlantic Ocean on her maiden voyage.

&quot;Alvin&quot;, accompanied by a small remotely operated vehicle (ROV) named &quot;Jason Jr.&quot;, was able to conduct detailed photographic surveys and inspections of &quot;Titanic&quot;″s wreckage. Many of the photographs of the expedition have been published in the magazine of the National Geographic Society, which was a major sponsor of the expedition.

The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution team involved in the &quot;Titanic&quot; expedition also explored the wreck of the , a armed with nuclear torpedoes, which sank off the coast of the Azores in 1968 in uncertain circumstances. &quot;Alvin&quot; obtained photographic and other environmental monitoring data from the remains of &quot;Scorpion&quot;.

===Recent overhauls===
Over the years, &quot;Alvin&quot; has undergone many overhauls to improve its equipment and extend its lifetime. In 2001, among other equipment, motor controllers and computer systems were added. The current &quot;Alvin&quot; is the same as the original vessel in name and general design only. All components of the vessel, including the frame and personnel sphere, have been replaced at least once. &quot;Alvin&quot; is completely disassembled every three to five years for a complete inspection. A new robotic arm was added in 2006.

===2008 upgrade ===
In June 2008 construction started on a stronger, slightly larger personnel sphere which was used to upgrade &quot;Alvin&quot;, before being used in an entirely new vehicle. The new sphere was designed, and then forged from solid titanium ingots in two equal halves at Ladish Forge, Cudahy, Wisconsin. Then the 15.5 tonnes of titanium was machined and assembled, utilizing five view ports (instead of the previous three) and is designed for depths of over , where &quot;Alvin&quot;″s original depth limit was . This, along with a general upgrade of support systems, instruments and materials. These upgrades allow &quot;Alvin&quot; to reach 98% of the ocean floor. 

===2011 to 2014 rebuild===
After one last dive to assess damage to the Gulf of Mexico&#x27;s seafloor after the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; disaster, &quot;Alvin&quot; was refitted further, starting January 2011. Alvin began an extensive rebuild, which featured new cameras, lighting, and an enlarged titanium personnel sphere. This three-and-a-half-year effort to upgrade the vessel implemented the core infrastructure to eventually increase its depth capability from to . In 2014, an extensively refitted &quot;Alvin&quot; conducted verification testing in the Gulf of Mexico, and was certified to return to service. In March and April 2014, &quot;Alvin&quot; was used to explore the site of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

===2020 to 2022 upgrade===
Starting in 2020, the second phase to upgrade Alvin for operation began; the 2014 rebuild with new, larger titanium, personnel hull and rebuilt structural frame being the first phase. In this phase, Alvin received new titanium ballast spheres, a second Schilling manipulator arm, a 4K imaging system, several new syntactic foam modules, an upgrade to the hydraulic system, and new thrusters. During 2022, Alvin successfully completed sea trials and was certified for operating down to 6500 meters.

==Current status==
As of 2024, &quot;Alvin&quot; is in active service, operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The research ship RV &quot;Atlantis&quot; serves as its support ship.

== Operation ==

Like most deep submergence vehicles, &quot;Alvin&quot; is normally transported on board its support vessel. It is launched shortly before a dive, and recovered after the dive, using a suitable (LARS) mounted on the support vessel. The support vessel is usually the R/V &quot;Atlantis&quot;, but several others have been used.

&quot;Alvin&quot; uses four steel weights (~1.7 cubic feet of steel) to provide negative buoyancy for the trip to the ocean floor. &quot;Alvin&quot; contains a ballast and trim system, but the steel weights allow deep dives to be achieved more rapidly. These weights are jettisoned on each dive and left at the bottom.

<text>A.I. Artificial Intelligence (or simply A.I.) is a 2001 American science fiction film directed by Steven Spielberg. The screenplay by Spielberg and screen story by Ian Watson are loosely based on the 1969 short story &quot;Supertoys Last All Summer Long&quot; by Brian Aldiss. Set in a futuristic society, the film stars Haley Joel Osment as David, a childlike android uniquely programmed with the ability to love. Jude Law, Frances O&#x27;Connor, Brendan Gleeson and William Hurt star in supporting roles.

Development of &quot;A.I.&quot; originally began after producer and director Stanley Kubrick acquired the rights to Aldiss&#x27;s story in the early 1970s. Kubrick hired a series of writers, including Aldiss, Bob Shaw, Ian Watson and Sara Maitland, until the mid-1990s. The film languished in development hell for years, partly because Kubrick felt that computer-generated imagery was not advanced enough to create the David character, which he believed no child actor would convincingly portray. In 1995, Kubrick handed &quot;A.I.&quot; to Spielberg, but the film did not gain momentum until Kubrick died in 1999. Spielberg remained close to Watson&#x27;s treatment for the screenplay and dedicated the film to Kubrick.

&quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; was released on June 29, 2001, by Warner Bros. Pictures in North America. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $235.9 million against a budget of $90–100 million. It was also nominated for Best Visual Effects and Best Original Score (for John Williams) at the 74th Academy Awards. In a 2016 BBC poll of 177 critics around the world, &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; was voted the eighty-third greatest film since 2000. It has since been called one of Spielberg&#x27;s best works and one of the greatest films of the 21st century, and of all time.

==Plot==
In the 22nd century, rising sea levels from global warming have wiped out coastal cities and altered the world&#x27;s climate. With the human population in decline, advanced nations have created humanoid robots called mechas to fulfill various roles in society.

In Madison, New Jersey, David, an 11-year-old prototype mecha child capable of experiencing love, is given to Henry Swinton and his wife Monica, whose son Martin is in suspended animation after contracting a rare disease. Initially uncomfortable with David, Monica eventually warms to him and activates his imprinting protocol. Wanting her to love him in return, he befriends Teddy, Martin&#x27;s old robotic teddy bear.

After Martin is unexpectedly cured of his disease and brought home, he jealously goads David into cutting off a piece of Monica&#x27;s hair. That night, David enters his adoptive parents&#x27; room, but as Monica turns over, the scissors accidentally poke her in the eye. While Henry attends to her wounds, Teddy picks up the lock of hair from the floor and places it in his pocket. During a pool party, one of Martin&#x27;s friends pokes David with a knife, triggering his self-protection programming. David grabs Martin, causing both of them to fall into the pool. While Martin is rescued, David is accused of endangering others.

Henry convinces Monica to return David to his creators for destruction. En route, she instead spares David by abandoning him in the woods full of scrap metal and obsolete mechas. Now accompanied solely by Teddy, David recalls &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot; and decides to find the Blue Fairy to become human, which he believes will regain Monica&#x27;s love.

David and Teddy are captured by the &quot;Flesh Fair&quot;, a traveling circus-like event at which obsolete mechas are destroyed in front of jeering crowds. About to be destroyed himself, David pleads for his life, and the audience revolts and allows David to escape with Gigolo Joe, a prostitute mecha on the run after being framed for murder. David, Teddy and Joe go to the decadent resort town of Rouge City, where &quot;Dr. Know&quot;, a holographic answer engine, directs them to the top of Rockefeller Center in the flooded ruins of New York City and provides fairy tale information that David interprets as suggesting that a Blue Fairy can help him.

Above the ruins of New York, David meets Professor Hobby, his creator, who tells him that their meeting demonstrates David&#x27;s ability to love and desire. David finds copies of himself, including female variants called &quot;Darlene&quot;, ready to be shipped. Disheartened by his lost sense of individuality, David attempts suicide by falling from a skyscraper into the ocean. While underwater, David notices a figure resembling the Blue Fairy before Joe rescues him in an amphibious aircraft. Before David can explain, authorities capture Joe with an electromagnet. David and Teddy take control of the aircraft to see the Blue Fairy, which turns out to be a statue from an attraction on Coney Island. The two become trapped when the Wonder Wheel falls on their vehicle. Believing that the Blue Fairy is real, David repeatedly asks the statue to turn him into a real boy until his power source is depleted.

Two thousand years later, humanity is extinct and Manhattan is buried under glacial ice. Mechas have evolved into an advanced form, and a group known as the Specialists, interested in humanity, find and resurrect David and Teddy. They reconstruct the Swinton family home from David&#x27;s memories before explaining, via an interactive version of the Blue Fairy, that he cannot become human. However, they recreate Monica through genetic material from the strand of hair that Teddy kept. This version of Monica can live for only one day and cannot be revived. David spends his happiest day with Monica, and as she falls asleep in the evening, Monica tells David that she has always loved him. David lies down next to her and closes his eyes.

==Production==

===Development===
Stanley Kubrick began development on an adaptation of &quot;Super-Toys Last All Summer Long&quot; in the late 1970s, hiring the story&#x27;s author, Brian Aldiss, to write a film treatment. In 1985, Kubrick asked Steven Spielberg to direct the film, with Kubrick producing. Warner Bros. agreed to co-finance &quot;A.I.&quot; and cover distribution duties. The film labored in development hell, and Aldiss was fired by Kubrick over creative differences in 1989. Bob Shaw briefly served as writer, leaving after six weeks due to Kubrick&#x27;s demanding work schedule, and Ian Watson was hired as the new writer in March 1990. Aldiss later remarked, &quot;Not only did the bastard fire me, he hired my enemy [Watson] instead.&quot; Kubrick handed Watson Carlo Collodi&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot; for inspiration, calling &quot;A.I.&quot; &quot;a picaresque robot version of &quot;Pinocchio&quot;&quot;.

Three weeks later, Watson gave Kubrick his first story treatment, and concluded his work on &quot;A.I.&quot; in May 1991 with another treatment of 90 pages. Gigolo Joe was originally conceived as a G.I. mecha, but Watson suggested changing him to a male prostitute. Kubrick joked, &quot;I guess we lost the kiddie market.&quot; Meanwhile, Kubrick dropped &quot;A.I.&quot; to work on a film adaptation of &quot;Wartime Lies&quot;, feeling computer animation was not advanced enough to create the David character. After the release of Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, with its innovative CGI, it was announced in November 1993 that production of &quot;A.I.&quot; would begin in 1994. Dennis Muren and Ned Gorman, who worked on &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, became visual effects supervisors, but Kubrick was displeased with their previsualization, and with the expense of hiring Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) and Stan Winston Studio.

Kubrick asked Sara Maitland to give the film mythic resonance. She recalls &quot;He never referred to the film as &#x27;A.I.&#x27;; he always called it &#x27;Pinocchio.&#x27;&quot; Kubrick&#x27;s version ended the same way Spielberg&#x27;s does, with advanced mechas reviving Monica, but only for a day.

===Pre-production===
In early 1994, the film was in pre-production with Christopher &quot;Fangorn&quot; Baker as concept artist and Sara Maitland assisting on the story, which gave it &quot;a feminist fairy-tale focus&quot;. Maitland said that Kubrick never referred to the film as &quot;A.I.&quot;, but as &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. Chris Cunningham became the new visual effects supervisor. Some of his unproduced work for &quot;A.I.&quot; can be seen on the DVD &quot;The Work of Director Chris Cunningham&quot;.

Aside from considering computer animation, Kubrick also had Joseph Mazzello do a screen test for the lead role. Cunningham helped assemble a series of &quot;little robot-type humans&quot; for the David character. &quot;We tried to construct a little boy with a movable rubber face to see whether we could make it look appealing,&quot; producer Jan Harlan reflected. &quot;But it was a total failure, it looked awful.&quot; Hans Moravec was brought in as a technical consultant. Meanwhile, Kubrick and Harlan thought that &quot;A.I.&quot; would be closer to Steven Spielberg&#x27;s sensibilities as director. Kubrick handed the position to Spielberg in 1995, but Spielberg chose to direct other projects and convinced Kubrick to remain as director. The film was put on hold due to Kubrick&#x27;s commitment to &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; (1999).

After Kubrick&#x27;s death in March 1999, Harlan and Christiane Kubrick approached Spielberg to take over the director&#x27;s position. By November 1999, Spielberg was writing the screenplay based on Watson&#x27;s 90-page story treatment. It was his first solo screenplay credit since &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977). Pre-production was briefly halted during February 2000 because Spielberg pondered directing other projects, which were &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, &quot;Minority Report&quot; and &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;. The following month, Spielberg announced that &quot;A.I.&quot; would be his next project, with &quot;Minority Report&quot; as a follow-up. When he decided to fast track &quot;A.I.&quot;, Spielberg brought back Chris Baker as concept artist. Ian Watson reported that the final script was very faithful to Kubrick&#x27;s vision; even the ending, which is often attributed to Spielberg, saying, &quot;The final 20 minutes are pretty close to what I wrote for Stanley, and what Stanley wanted, faithfully filmed by Spielberg without added schmaltz&quot;.

===Filming and visual effects===
The original start date was July 10, 2000, but filming was delayed until August. Aside from a couple of weeks of shooting on location in Oxbow Regional Park in Oregon, &quot;A.I.&quot; was shot entirely using sound stages at Warner Bros. Studios and the Spruce Goose Dome in Long Beach, California.

Spielberg copied Kubrick&#x27;s obsessively secretive approach to filmmaking by refusing to give the complete script to cast and crew, banning press from the set, and making actors sign confidentiality agreements. For instance, Jack Angel, who voiced Teddy, recorded his lines entirely out of context, only receiving direction to sound like Eeyore from &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot;, except &quot;very wise and old and stoic&quot;. However, Spielberg asked Angel to be on the set every day to make line alterations wherever he felt necessary. Social robotics expert Cynthia Breazeal served as technical consultant during production. Costume designer Bob Ringwood studied pedestrians on the Las Vegas Strip for his influence on the Rouge City extras.
Visual effects, such as removing the visible rods controlling Teddy and removing Haley Joel Osment&#x27;s breath, were provided in-houses by PDI/DreamWorks.

===Casting===
Julianne Moore and Gwyneth Paltrow were considered for the role of Monica Swinton before Frances O&#x27;Connor was cast. Jerry Seinfeld was originally considered to voice and play the Comedian Robot before Chris Rock was cast.

===Allusions===
A. O. Scott notes Spielberg&#x27;s homages to Kubrick, &quot;sly references to &quot;A Clockwork Orange,&quot; &quot;The Shining&quot; and predominantly &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;&quot; as well as Collodi&#x27;s &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. The lines Dr. Know quotes are from W. B. Yeats&#x27;s &quot;The Stolen Child&quot;:

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s soundtrack album was released by Warner Sunset Records in 2001. The original score was composed and conducted by John Williams and features singers Lara Fabian on two songs and Josh Groban on one. The film&#x27;s score also had a limited release as an official &quot;For your consideration Academy Promo&quot;, as well as a complete score issued by La-La Land Records in 2015. The band Ministry appears in the film playing the song &quot;What About Us?&quot;, but the song does not appear on the official soundtrack album.

Williams called his score an &quot;homage a Kubrick.&quot; He includes echoes of Gyorgy Ligeti&#x27;s choral music, which Kubrick used in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey.&quot; Per Kubrick&#x27;s request, Williams included a quotation of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; in his score.

==Release==

===Marketing===
The teaser trailer debuted on December 8, 2000, with the theatrical release of &quot;Proof of Life&quot;. Warner Bros. used an alternate reality game titled &quot;The Beast&quot; to promote the film. Over forty websites were created by Atomic Pictures in New York City (kept online at Cloudmakers.org), including the website for Cybertronics Corp. There were to be a series of video games for the Xbox video game console that followed the storyline of &quot;The Beast&quot;, but they went undeveloped. To avoid audiences mistaking &quot;A.I.&quot; for a family film, no action figures were created, although Hasbro released a talking Teddy following the film&#x27;s release in June 2001.

&quot;A.I.&quot; premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2001.

===Home media===
&quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; was released on VHS and DVD in the United States by DreamWorks Home Entertainment and Touchstone Home Video on March 5, 2002 in widescreen and fullscreen two-disc special editions featuring an extensive sixteen-part documentary detailing the film&#x27;s development, production, visual effects, sound design and music. The bonuses also include interviews with Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Frances O&#x27;Connor, Steven Spielberg and John Williams, two teaser trailers for the film&#x27;s original theatrical release, and an extensive photo gallery featuring production stills and Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s original storyboards. It was released overseas by Warner Home Video.

The film was released on Blu-ray in Japan by Warner Home Video on December 22, 2010, followed shortly by a United States release by Paramount Home Entertainment and Touchstone Home Entertainment (owners of the pre-2010 DreamWorks catalog) on April 5, 2011. This Blu-ray features the film remastered in high-definition and incorporates all the bonus features previously included on the two-disc special-edition DVD.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened in 3,242 theaters in the United States and Canada on June 29, 2001, earning $29.35 million at #1 during its opening weekend. &quot;A.I&quot; went on to gross $78.62 million in the United States and Canada. Opening on 524 screens in Japan, &quot;A.I.&quot; grossed almost two billion Yen in its first five days, the biggest June opening in Japan at the time, and sold more tickets in its opening weekend than &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;, although it grossed slightly less. It went on to gross $78 million in Japan. It grossed $79 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $235.93 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; holds an approval rating of 76% based on reviews from 203 critics, with an average rating of 6.60/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;A curious, not always seamless, amalgamation of Kubrick&#x27;s chilly bleakness and Spielberg&#x27;s warm-hearted optimism. &quot;A.I.&quot; is, in a word, fascinating.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100 based on reviews from 32 critics, which indicates &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

Producer Jan Harlan stated that Kubrick &quot;would have applauded&quot; the final film, while Kubrick&#x27;s widow Christiane also enjoyed &quot;A.I&quot;. Brian Aldiss admired the film as well: &quot;I thought what an inventive, intriguing, ingenious, involving film this was. There are flaws in it and I suppose I might have a personal quibble but it&#x27;s so long since I wrote it.&quot; Of the film&#x27;s ending, he wondered how it might have been had Kubrick directed the film: &quot;That is one of the &#x27;ifs&#x27; of film history—at least the ending indicates Spielberg adding some sugar to Kubrick&#x27;s wine. The actual ending is overly sympathetic and moreover rather overtly engineered by a plot device that does not really bear credence. But it&#x27;s a brilliant piece of film and of course it&#x27;s a phenomenon because it contains the energies and talents of two brilliant filmmakers.&quot;

A. O. Scott writes: &quot;Mr. Spielberg seems to be attempting the improbable feat of melding Kubrick&#x27;s chilly, analytical style with his own warmer, needier sensibility. He tells the story slowly and films it with lucid, mesmerizing objectivity, creating a mood as layered, dissonant and strange as John Williams&#x27;s unusually restrained, modernist score.&quot; He concludes: &quot;The very end somehow fuses the cathartic comfort of infantile wish fulfillment -- the dream that the first perfect love whose loss we experience as the fall from Eden might be restored -- with a feeling almost too terrible to acknowledge or to name. Refusing to cuddle us or lull us into easy sleep, Mr. Spielberg locates the unspoken moral of all our fairy tales. To be real is to be mortal; to be human is to love, to dream and to perish.&quot;

Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; magazine heavily praised Spielberg&#x27;s direction, as well as the cast and visual effects.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of a possible four, saying that it is &quot;wonderful and maddening&quot;. Ebert later gave the film a full four stars and added it to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; canon in 2011.

Leonard Maltin, on the other hand, gives the film two stars out of four in his &quot;Movie Guide&quot;, writing, &quot;[The] intriguing story draws us in, thanks in part to Osment&#x27;s exceptional performance, but takes several wrong turns; ultimately, it just doesn&#x27;t work. Spielberg rewrote the adaptation Stanley Kubrick commissioned of the Brian Aldiss short story &quot;Super Toys Last All Summer Long&quot;; [the] result is a curious and uncomfortable hybrid of Kubrick and Spielberg sensibilities.&quot; However, Maltin called John Williams&#x27;s music score &quot;striking&quot;.

Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; compared &quot;A.I.&quot; to &quot;Solaris&quot; (1972), and praised both &quot;Kubrick for proposing that Spielberg direct the project and Spielberg for doing his utmost to respect Kubrick&#x27;s intentions while making it a profoundly personal work&quot;. In 2009, he described &quot;A.I.&quot; as &quot;a very great and deeply misunderstood film&quot;, noting that Andrew Sarris, Stan Brakhage and James Naremore &quot;more or less&quot; agreed with this assessment.

Film critic Armond White of the &quot;New York Press&quot; praised the film, noting that &quot;each part of David&#x27;s journey through carnal and sexual universes into the final eschatological devastation becomes as profoundly philosophical and contemplative as anything by cinema&#x27;s most thoughtful, speculative artists – Borzage, Ozu, Demy, Tarkovsky.&quot;

Filmmaker Billy Wilder hailed &quot;A.I.&quot; as &quot;the most underrated film of the past few years&quot;. When British filmmaker Ken Russell saw the film, he wept during the ending.

Screenwriter Ian Watson has speculated, &quot;Worldwide, &quot;A.I.&quot; was very successful (and the 4th-highest earner of the year) but it didn&#x27;t do quite so well in America, because the film, so I&#x27;m told, was too poetical and intellectual in general for American tastes. Plus, quite a few critics in America misunderstood the film, thinking for instance that the Giacometti-style beings in the final 20 minutes were aliens (whereas they were robots of the future who had evolved themselves from the robots in the earlier part of the film) and also thinking that the final 20 minutes were a sentimental addition by Spielberg, whereas those scenes were exactly what I wrote for Stanley and exactly what he wanted, filmed faithfully by Spielberg.&quot;

Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; gave a largely negative review. &quot;&quot;A.I.&quot; exhibits all its creators&#x27; bad traits and none of the good. So we end up with the structureless, meandering, slow-motion endlessness of Kubrick combined with the fuzzy, cuddly mindlessness of Spielberg.&quot; Dubbing it Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;first boring movie&quot;, LaSalle also believed that the robots at the end of the film were aliens, and compared Gigolo Joe to the &quot;useless&quot; Jar Jar Binks, yet praised Robin Williams for his portrayal of a futuristic Albert Einstein.

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine gave a mixed review, concluding, &quot;Spielberg cannot live up to Kubrick&#x27;s darker side of the future&quot;, but still put the film on his top ten list that year.

David Denby in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; criticized &quot;A.I.&quot; for not adhering closely to his concept of the Pinocchio character.

Spielberg responded to some of the criticisms of the film, stating that many of the &quot;so called sentimental&quot; elements of &quot;A.I.&quot;, including the ending, were in fact Kubrick&#x27;s, and the darker elements were his own. However, Sara Maitland, who worked on the project with Kubrick in the 1990s, said that Kubrick never started production on &quot;A.I.&quot; because he had a hard time making the ending work.

James Berardinelli found the film &quot;consistently involving, with moments of near-brilliance, but far from a masterpiece. In fact, as the long-awaited &#x27;collaboration&#x27; of Kubrick and Spielberg, it ranks as something of a disappointment.&quot; Of the film&#x27;s highly debated finale, he claimed, &quot;There is no doubt that the concluding 30 minutes are all Spielberg; the outstanding question is where Kubrick&#x27;s vision left off and Spielberg&#x27;s began.&quot;

John Simon of the &quot;National Review&quot; described &quot;A.I.&quot; &quot;as an uneasy mix of trauma and treacle&quot;.

In 2002, Spielberg told film critic Joe Leydon, &quot;People pretend to think they know Stanley Kubrick, and think they know me, when most of them don&#x27;t know either of us... And what&#x27;s really funny about that is, all the parts of &quot;A.I.&quot; that people assume were Stanley&#x27;s were mine. And all the parts of &quot;A.I.&quot; that people accuse me of sweetening and softening and sentimentalizing were all Stanley&#x27;s. The teddy bear was Stanley&#x27;s. The whole last 20 minutes of the movie was completely Stanley&#x27;s. The whole first 35, 40 minutes of the film—all the stuff in the house—was word for word, from Stanley&#x27;s screenplay. This was Stanley&#x27;s vision... Eighty percent of the critics got it all mixed up. But I could see why. Because, obviously, I&#x27;ve done a lot of movies where people have cried and have been sentimental. And I&#x27;ve been accused of sentimentalizing hard-core material. But in fact it was Stanley who did the sweetest parts of &quot;A.I.&quot;, not me. I&#x27;m the guy who did the dark center of the movie, with the Flesh Fair and everything else. That&#x27;s why he wanted me to make the movie in the first place. He said, &#x27;This is much closer to your sensibilities than my own. Spielberg said, &quot;While there was divisiveness when &quot;A.I.&quot; came out, I felt that I had achieved Stanley&#x27;s wishes, or goals.&quot;

On re-watching the film many years after its release, BBC film critic Mark Kermode apologized to Spielberg in a January 2013 interview for &quot;getting it wrong&quot; on the film when he first viewed it in 2001. He came to believe that the film is Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;enduring masterpiece&quot;.

===Accolades===
Visual effects supervisors Dennis Muren, Stan Winston, Michael Lantieri and Scott Farrar were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, and John Williams was nominated for Best Original Music Score. Steven Spielberg, Jude Law and Williams received nominations at the 59th Golden Globe Awards. &quot;A.I.&quot; was successful at the Saturn Awards, winning five awards, including Best Science Fiction Film along with Best Writing for Spielberg and Best Performance by a Younger Actor for Osment.
American Film Institute nominated the film in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Film Scores.

<text>Michael Ryan Pritchard (born May 4, 1972), better known by his stage name Mike Dirnt, is an American rock musician who is the co-founder, bassist, backing vocalist, and occasional lead vocalist of Green Day. He has also played in several other bands, including the Frustrators. His stage name Dirnt was originally a nickname that his friends from grade school gave him, as he constantly played &quot;air bass/guitar&quot; and made a &quot;dirnt, dirnt, dirnt&quot; noise while pretending to pluck the strings.

==Early life and education==
Pritchard was born in Oakland, California on May 4, 1972. As a child, his father was often away obtaining a degree, while his mother stayed at home to care for him and his sister Myla. Pritchard excelled in school, despite often missing classes as a result of various illnesses attributed to his biological mother&#x27;s drug use.

After an argument between his parents led to a call to the police, the couple divorced. His mother and sister moved to Rodeo, California, while he stayed in El Sobrante, California, with his father. However, missing his mother, he eventually moved in with her and Myla. Having been previously described as bright and fearless, Dirnt became sullen and withdrawn after the divorce.

In the cafeteria in Carquinez Middle School, ten-year-old Pritchard met Billie Joe Armstrong, with whom he bonded instantly. Armstrong began to play guitar with Mike, and the two spent time together at Armstrong&#x27;s house learning songs by the Ramones, Ozzy Osbourne, Def Leppard, Hüsker Dü, AC/DC, Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Replacements, the Who, and Van Halen. At the age of 14, they formed a group named &quot;Sweet Children.&quot;

After attending Salesian High School, an all-boys Catholic school for his first year, Pritchard transferred to Pinole Valley High School, where Armstrong had also recently transferred from John Swett High School. Pritchard&#x27;s family struggled with financial troubles; in an effort to help out, he worked as a chef at Nantucket, a seafood restaurant in Crockett. He eventually saved enough money to purchase a used pickup truck that he and Armstrong often drove to Berkeley, where they attended shows at 924 Gilman Street, an influential DIY punk club. The pair got jobs at the club as security guards, despite their small physiques. Mike recalled, &quot;We lived and died for that place. At that time, it meant everything.&quot;

== Career ==
While at Pinole Valley High School, Dirnt and classmate Armstrong formed a band called Sweet Children. Dirnt&#x27;s mother struggled to provide for him and his sister as a single parent and eventually had to leave Rodeo in 1987 to look for work. Unwilling to leave Sweet Children, Armstrong and Dirnt convinced each other&#x27;s parents to allow Dirnt to move into Armstrong&#x27;s garage.

After drummer John Kiffmeyer, who was also known as Al Sobrante, joined the group and replaced original drummer Raj Punjabi, Sweet Children began performing at 924 Gilman Street. The band performed several well-received sets, which encouraged Armstrong to drop out of high school to focus his energy on music. Dirnt, however, worried that he needed a backup plan and continued his studies.

Bass player Sean Hughes, who was not as dedicated to the group as the other members, left Sweet Children, leaving Dirnt to play bass. Dirnt often brought his bass to school, and the plucking noise of the unamplified strings led classmates to jokingly call him by the onomatopoeia &quot;Dirnt&quot;. After changing its name to Green Day, the band recorded its debut album &quot;39/Smooth&quot; over the 1989 Christmas holiday break and went on its first van tour in June 1990, leaving the day that Dirnt graduated from high school.

At Woodstock &#x27;94, Green Day started an infamous mud fight, during which several fans invaded the stage. Overwhelmed by the chaotic situation, concert security mistook the mud-soaked Dirnt for a fan and tackled him, knocking out one of his teeth. Dirnt required emergency orthodontia due to this incident.

While performing at the 1998 KROQ Weenie Roast in Irvine, California, Third Eye Blind bassist Arion Salazar ran onstage and &quot;bear-hugged&quot; Dirnt, who was caught off-guard. The incident escalated into an on-stage scuffle before security escorted Salazar away. After the performance, Dirnt confronted Salazar backstage, and as the two argued, a beer bottle struck Dirnt in the head, causing a small fracture in his skull. Eyewitnesses later attributed the bottle-throwing to a fan of Third Eye Blind, though this was disputed by another eyewitness on the following day&#x27;s Loveline broadcast. Salazar and the band&#x27;s management soon released a statement: &quot;I am sorry that my attempt at doing something I thought would be funny escalated into Mike getting hurt. That was never my intention. I simply had too much to drink and made a very bad decision. If I had been in Mike&#x27;s place, I am sure I would have acted similarly. My heart goes out to him and I hope he recovers quickly.&quot;

Dirnt helped form the secret Green Day side project The Network during the summer of 2003. The six-piece new wave band consists of the members of Green Day, along with touring members and friends of the band. They released their debut album &quot;Money Money 2020&quot; on September 30, 2003. After a seventeen-year hiatus, the band released their second album, &quot;Money Money 2020 Part II: We Told Ya So!&quot;, on December 4, 2020. In addition to playing bass for the band, Dirnt also provides lead vocals on many of their tracks (in contrast to his work with Green Day, where he primarily provides backing vocals).

In the live album, &quot;Bullet in a Bible,&quot; Armstrong calls Dirnt &quot;the best bass player in the history of punk rock&quot;.

In 2007, during the recording of Green Day&#x27;s eighth studio album &quot;21st Century Breakdown&quot;, Dirnt, Armstrong, and drummer Tré Cool formed the garage rock side project, Foxboro Hot Tubs. In addition to the three members of Green Day, the band also includes Green Day touring members Jason White, Jason Freese and Kevin Preston. They released their debut album &quot;Stop Drop and Roll!!!&quot; in 2008. Dirnt played bass and provided backup vocals on the album.

In 2012, during the iHeartRadio Music Festival, Dirnt and Armstrong smashed their respective bass and guitar after Armstrong became agitated onstage and ranted about Green Day&#x27;s set being cut short.

On April 18, 2015, Dirnt and his Green Day bandmates were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility.

=== Songwriting and lead vocals ===
Although Armstrong is Green Day&#x27;s main lyricist, Dirnt has written lyrics for &quot;Emenius Sleepus&quot;, &quot;J.A.R. (Jason Andrew Relva)&quot;, &quot;Scumbag&quot;, &quot;Ha Ha You&#x27;re Dead&quot;, the subtrack &quot;Nobody Likes You&quot; from the medley &quot;Homecoming&quot; and the B-side &quot;Governator&quot;, He also co-wrote the lyrics to &quot;Best Thing in Town&quot;, &quot;The One I Want&quot;, and &quot;Panic Song&quot; with Armstrong, and writes all the bass lines for Green Day songs. Mike also composed the intro to &quot;Desensitized&quot; from &quot;Shenanigans&quot; using a baseball bat and an old cathode ray tube television.

Dirnt sings lead vocals on &quot;Governator&quot;, part of the third verse of &quot;Outsider&quot; on the &quot;Shenanigans&quot; album, the &quot;Nobody Likes You&quot; subtrack of &quot;Homecoming&quot;. He also sings the subtrack &quot;Modern World&quot; from the medley &quot;American Eulogy&quot; from &quot;21st Century Breakdown&quot; and sings lead for exactly 10 seconds in &quot;Sex, Drugs, and Violence&quot; from &quot;¡Tré!&quot;.

For the Green Day side project The Network, Dirnt shares lead vocal duties with Armstrong. Some notable tracks that feature Dirnt as the lead vocalist include &quot;Joe Robot&quot;, &quot;Reto&quot;, &quot;Money Money 2020&quot;, &quot;Trans Am&quot;, and &quot;Digital Black&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Dirnt married his first wife, Anastasia Serman, in 1996; they divorced in 1999. Anastasia and Dirnt had a daughter together, Estelle Desiree, who was born on December 20, 1996. He won full custody of his daughter in the summer of 2008 and took her to live in Oakland.

In 2004, he married girlfriend Sarah Garrity in a private villa in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. The two divorced that same year.

On March 14, 2009, he married Brittney Cade in a private ceremony in Brittney&#x27;s hometown of Ojai, California. Dirnt has two children with Cade: a son, Brixton Michael (born October 11, 2008), and a daughter, Ryan Ruby Mae (born November 29, 2010).

Dirnt is a &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan; he stated jokingly in an interview that he bases &quot;most of his religious beliefs&quot; on &quot;Star Wars&quot;. His birthday is on Star Wars Day. Dirnt&#x27;s favorite bass player was Cliff Burton. He is a part owner of Rudy&#x27;s Can&#x27;t Fail Cafe, a diner in Emeryville and Oakland. The diner was named after a song by punk rock band the Clash, &quot;Rudie Can&#x27;t Fail&quot;, from their album &quot;London Calling&quot;. The menu item names are loosely based on punk themes such as &quot;God Save the Chicken&quot;, a reference to &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; by the Sex Pistols, and &quot;Give &#x27;Em Enough Meatloaf&quot;, a reference to &quot;Give &#x27;Em Enough Rope&quot; by the Clash.

Dirnt was adopted; his biological mother died on January 9, 2013. Dirnt only managed to meet her one month before her death.

In July 2014, it was announced that Dirnt would co-produce the Indie film &quot;Crickets&quot;, with Green Day manager, Pat Magnarella.

In December 2015, Dirnt along with Billie Joe Armstrong announced that they would launch a coffee company, &quot;Oakland Coffee Works&quot;. The company sells organic coffee beans and is the first company to exclusively use 100% compostable bags and pods.

In 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic Armstrong noted that Dirnt is &quot;basically becoming a farmer&quot;.

<doc id="142234" wikidata="Q327500" url="?curid=142234" title="Joseph Furphy">
<text>Joseph Furphy (Irish: Seosamh Ó Foirbhithe; 26 September 1843 – 13 September 1912) was an Australian author and poet. He mostly wrote under the pseudonym Tom Collins and is best known for his novel &quot;Such Is Life&quot; (1903), regarded as an Australian classic.

==Personal life==
Furphy was born at Yering Station in Yering, Victoria. His father, Samuel Furphy, was originally a tenant farmer from Tandragee, County Armagh, Ireland, who emigrated to Australia in . Samuel Furphy was head gardener on the station. There was no school in the district and at first Joseph was educated by his mother. The only books available were the Bible and Shakespeare and at seven years of age Furphy was already learning passages of each by heart; he never forgot them. In about 1850 the family moved to Kangaroo Ground, Victoria, and here the parents of the district built a school and obtained a master. In 1852 they moved again, to Kyneton where Samuel Furphy began business as a hay and corn merchant. A few years later he leased a farm and also bought a threshing plant. This was worked by Joseph and a brother and both became competent engine-drivers. In 1864 Furphy bought a threshing outfit and travelled the Daylesford and surrounding districts. At Glenlyon he met Leonie Selina Germain, a girl of 16 of French extraction, and in they were married.

Soon after, his wife&#x27;s mother went to New Zealand and Furphy for a time carried on her farm, but two years later took up a selection near Colbinabbin. The land proved to be poor and in about 1873 he sold out and soon afterwards bought a team of bullocks. He became prosperous as the years went by, but the drought came and he had heavy losses. Some of his bullocks and horses died from pleuro-pneumonia, and in 1884 he accepted a position in the foundry of his brother John at Shepparton. There he worked for some 20 years doing much reading in the evenings.

In 1904, Furphy and his wife moved to Western Australia to join his sons. He built a house at Swanbourne. Furphy died in Claremont on 13 September 1912 and is buried in Karrakatta Cemetery.

==Literary career==

In his youth Furphy had written many verses and in December 1867 he had been awarded the first prize of £3 at the Kyneton Literary Society for a vigorous set of verses on &#x27;The Death of President Lincoln&#x27;. While living at Shepparton, he was encouraged in his writing by Kate Baker, a schoolteacher who boarded with his mother. He sent a story &#x27;The Mythical Sundowner&#x27; to &quot;The Bulletin&quot; under the name &#x27;Warrigal Jack&#x27; and it was accepted for publication. Later works were published under the pseudonym &#x27;Tom Collins&#x27; which may have come from the slang term meaning &quot;a fellow about town whom many sought to kill for touching them on &#x27;sore points&#x27;&quot;.

His most famous work is &quot;Such Is Life&quot;, a fictional account of the life of rural dwellers, including bullock drivers, squatters and itinerant travellers, in southern New South Wales and Victoria, during the 1880s. In 1897 the manuscript was sent to &quot;The Bulletin&quot; where A. G. Stephens recognised its worth, but also that it was not a commercial proposition. He suggested cuts including the replacement of two entire chapters. Stephens persuaded the proprietors of &quot;The Bulletin&quot; to publish the revised &quot;Such Is Life&quot; because it was a great Australian work although not commercially viable. It was published in 1903 under his pseudonym &#x27;Tom Collins&#x27; and only sold about a third of the print run. Through the efforts of Kate Baker who bought the residual copies from &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, later editions were brought out after Furphy&#x27;s death 

Having removed the original chapters 2 and 5 from &quot;Such is Life&quot;, Furphy considered joining these portions together as the basis for another novel but instead decided to focus on chapter 5 separately. He expanded and remodelled the chapter to form &quot;Rigby&#x27;s Romance&quot;, which was serialised in &quot;The Barrier Truth&quot; from 27 October 1905 to 20 July 1906. It would be released in book form in 1921. After moving to Western Australia in 1905, Furphy commenced work on revising the original second chapter, which he titled &quot;The Lyre Bird and the Native Companion&quot; before retitling it &quot;The Buln-Buln and the Brolga&quot;. Never published in his lifetime, the manuscript was provided by Furphy&#x27;s son Samuel and ultimately published in book form in 1946. Both of these subsequent novels feature the same protagonist, Tom Collins, and function as adjuncts to the first novel.

==Legacy==

&quot;Such is Life&quot; has been described as Australia&#x27;s &quot;Moby Dick&quot; because, like Melville&#x27;s book, it was neglected for thirty or forty years before being discovered as a classic. The novel contains possibly the first written incidence of the Australian and New Zealand idiom &quot;ropeable&quot;. Chapter One contains the following phrase: &quot;On&#x27;t ole Martin be ropeable when he sees that fence!&quot; The historian Stuart MacIntyre has said the book challenged the assumption that &quot;nothing of significance ever happened&quot; in Australia or that Australians lacked &quot;creative originality&quot;.

A full biography of Furphy was written through a collaboration of Australian author Miles Franklin and Furphy&#x27;s friend Kate Baker, titled &quot;Joseph Furphy: The Legend of a Man and His Book&quot;, in 1944.

To honour Furphy, in 1992 his and his brother&#x27;s descendants established the Furphy Literary award. On the 100th anniversary of &quot;Such is Life&quot; they also funded a statue in Furphy&#x27;s home town. The home which Furphy built in Swanbourne is now the headquarters of the West Australian branch of the Fellowship of Australian Writers.

Furphy&#x27;s popularity may have influenced the usage of the Australian slang word &quot;furphy&quot;, meaning a &quot;tall story&quot;. However, scholars consider it more likely that the word originated with water carts, produced in large numbers by J. Furphy &amp; Sons, a company owned by Furphy&#x27;s brother John.

<doc id="142235" wikidata="Q1481362" url="?curid=142235" title="Marcus Clarke">
<text>Marcus Andrew Hislop Clarke (24 April 1846 – 2 August 1881) was an English-born Australian novelist, journalist, poet, editor, librarian, and playwright. He is best known for his 1874 novel &quot;For the Term of His Natural Life&quot;, about the convict system in Australia, and widely regarded as a classic of Australian literature. It has been adapted into many plays, films and a folk opera.

== Biography ==
=== Background and early life ===
Marcus Clarke was born in 11 Leonard Place Kensington, London, the only son of London barrister William Hislop Clarke and Amelia Elizabeth Matthews Clarke, who died when he was just four years old. He was the nephew of Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Andrew Clarke, a Governor of Western Australia, and grandson of a retired military medical officer, Dr Andrew Clarke, who made his fortune in the West Indies and settled in Ireland. Clarke was born with his left arm at least two inches shorter than the right, which prevented him from joining the army, though he became an accomplished diver in his days at Cholmeley Grammar, Highgate School. Clarke also had a slight stammer which remained his whole life.

Marcus Clarke was educated at Highgate School (1858–62), where his classmates included Gerard Manley Hopkins, Cyril Hopkins and E.H. Coleridge. Clarke attracted Hopkins&#x27; attention primarily due to his eloquence, leading Hopkins to describe him as a &quot;kaleidoscopic, parti-coloured, harlequinesque, thaumatropic Being&quot; Clarke had problems with applying himself to his schoolwork, and was deprived, in his senior year, of the poetry prize as punishment. On one hand he was considered charming and witty, but on the other spoilt, conceited and aimless which could be partially attributed to his Bohemian upbringing by this father, and the novels which he spent much of his time reading.

In 1862, father William was sent to Northumberland House suffering a mental, physical, and financial breakdown and died there a year later, leaving Clarke an orphan and without the means to live as a dilettante, which had been his expectation. The biography &quot;Cyril Hopkins&#x27; Marcus Clarke&quot; is the only first-hand account of Clarke&#x27;s early life in London. It draws on first-hand experiences of both author and subject.

At age 17, his cousin, Andrew Clarke, suggested he emigrate to Victoria where another relative, their uncle, James Langton Clarke, was a county court judge working in Ararat. Writing from his journey to Australia, he sent Hopkins a letter describing a sunset he had witnessed; this letter probably figured as partial inspiration for Hopkins&#x27; poem &quot;A Vision of the Mermaids&quot;. After arriving in Melbourne on 6 June 1863, Clarke was at first a clerk in the Bank of Australasia, but showed no business ability. After a year, he moved to the country and proceeded to learn farming at a station on the Wimmera River, near Glenorchy, Victoria where his uncle had an interest.

=== Writing career ===
Clarke was already writing stories for the &quot;Australian Magazine&quot;, when in 1867 he joined the staff of &quot;The Argus&quot; and &quot;The Australasian&quot; in Melbourne through the introduction of Dr. Robert Lewins, writing under the heading &#x27;The Peripatetic Philosopher&#x27;. He was noted for his vivid descriptions of Melbourne&#x27;s street scenes and city types, including the &quot;low life&quot; of opium dens, brothels and gambling houses. He always claimed he was interested in the &quot;parti-colored, patch-worked garment of life&quot;. These columns brought Clarke to the attention of the public, who enjoyed his schoolboy humor and his popularity as a writer grew. Clarke contributed to many colonial newspapers and he was the local correspondent for the London &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;.

In 1868 Clarke founded the Yorick Club, which soon numbered among its members the chief Australian men of letters and 1869 he married the actress Marian Dunn (often &quot;Marion&quot;), daughter of actor and comedian John Dunn, with whom he had six children. Clarke wrote &quot;two sparkling comedies&quot; specially for Marian, &quot;A Daughter of Eve&quot; and &quot;Forbidden Fruit.&quot; One of his writing projects at this time was he and Henry Kendall working together to produce the short-lived satirical magazine &quot;Humbug&quot; (1869–70).Clarke briefly visited Tasmania in 1870 at the request of &quot;The Argus&quot; to experience at first hand the settings of articles he was writing on the convict period. &quot;Old Stories Retold&quot; began to appear in &quot;The Australasian&quot; from February. The following month his great novel &quot;His Natural Life&quot; (later called &quot;For the Term of His Natural Life&quot;) commenced serialization in &quot;The Australian Journal&quot; (which Clarke was editing), and was later published in book form in 1874. &quot;For the Term of His Natural Life&quot; is a &quot;ripping yarn&quot;, which at times relies on unrealistic coincidences. The story follows the fortunes of Rufus Dawes, a young man transported for a theft that he did not commit, when rendering assistance to the victim of a mugging. The harsh and inhumane treatment meted out to the convicts, some of whom were transported for relatively minor crimes, is clearly conveyed. The conditions experienced by the convicts are graphically described. The novel was based on research by the author as well as a visit to the penal settlement of Port Arthur. Clarke originally referred to the novel as &quot;His Unnatural Life.&quot; One critic has claimed that Clarke&#x27;s novel is &quot;the book that, more than any other, has defined our perception of the Australian convict experience.&quot;. &quot;For the Term of his Natural Life&quot; is considered a novel in the grand tradition, that places Clarke with Charles Reade, Victor Hugo and Fyodor Dostoevsky among the great nineteenth-century visionaries who found in the problems of crime and punishment a new insight, especially relevant in the convict-founded Australian colonies, into the foundations of human worth.

Clarke also wrote &quot;The Peripatetic Philosopher&quot; (1869), a series of amusing papers reprinted from &quot;The Australasian&quot;; &quot;Long Odds&quot; (London, 1870), a novel; and numerous comedies and pantomimes, the best of which was &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&quot; (Theatre Royal, Melbourne; Christmas, 1873). In spite of his popular success, Clarke was constantly involved in financial difficulties and twice (1874 and 1881) he was forced into insolvency. His financial difficulties in 1874 forced him to sell his furniture and the 574 volumes that made up his personal library.

In 1872, Clarke was appointed secretary to the trustees of the Melbourne Public Library (now known as State Library Victoria) and in 1876 became sub (assistant) librarian. It is said he carried out his duties with reasonable efficiency but &quot;levity pursued him&quot;, and when he applied for the position of Chief Librarian in 1881, he was refused. The library holds a unique collection of papers that relate to Marcus Clarke; the finding aid accessed via the website describes the &quot;correspondence, manuscripts of prose and plays, notebooks, diaries, newspapers and press cuttings, legal documents and other miscellaneous papers and books&quot;. As well as holding books, pictures, manuscripts, music scores and journals, two unusual collection items (classified as &quot;Realia&quot;) are his death mask and his Cabbage Tree hat. Clarke and his work have been featured in several exhibitions held at the library, most recently &quot;Bohemian Melbourne&quot; (2014) which was attended by over 70,000 visitors.

Clarke was an important literary figure in Australia, and at the centre of a bohemian circle in Melbourne. Among the writers in contact with him were Victor Daley, Thomas Bracken, John Shillinglaw, Henry Kendall, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Julian Thomas, Robert P. Whitworth, Adam Lindsay Gordon and George Gordon McCrae. As well as friends, he also made enemies. These included James Neild and James Smith. In 1877, he served a term as the chairman of the library committee of the Melbourne Athenaeum (founded 1839) the oldest cultural institution in the city.

Anxiety, overwork, disappointment and health problems are said to have hastened his death (officially of erysipelas) in Melbourne on 2 August 1881 at the age of 35. Clarke was buried in Melbourne General Cemetery and in August 1898, a &quot;fine granite monument&quot; was erected over the grave.
=== Legacy ===
Shortly after Clarke&#x27;s death, the theatre community rallied to support his family, organizing a charity costumed Australian rules football match which was held at the East Melbourne Cricket Ground. For two hours &quot;Heroes of familiar opera, tragedy, comedy, farce, and pantomime were banded together in strange juxtaposition. It was as if the silent figures of the Waxworks exhibition has been suddenly stirred to into wild life and energetic action&quot;. Whilst the match was not high scoring (the Opera House team kicked six goals, the other team only one), nearly a thousand spectators attended the event, and £74/1/6 was raised.

In 1884 &quot;Marcus Clarke Memorial Volume&quot;, assembled by his friend and literary executor Hamilton Mackinnon, was published. It contained a &quot;a selection of his most popular journalism with a biographical introduction&quot; with a dedication to the 5th Earl of Rosebery, Archibald Philip Primrose (Prime Minister of England from March 1894 till June 1895) who was a great support of &quot;His Natural Life&quot;. In a five-page letter to his wife Marian Clarke, dated 16 January 1884, Lord Rosebery states that he had always admired the book, had given copies to his friends and compared it favourably with &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; and Victor Hugo&#x27;s works.

== Recognition ==
&quot;For the Term of his Natural Life&quot; has been translated into Dutch, German, Russian, Swedish, and Chinese. A number of editions were published in Britain and the United States.

Clarke came first in a 1927 newspaper poll in Melbourne to identify the top Australian novelist.

Clarke&#x27;s life was dramatised in a 40min 1946 radio play &quot;Marcus Clarke&quot;, written by Brian Elliott. Elliott was a lecturer in Australian history and an expert on Clarke. The play was broadcast to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of Clarke&#x27;s birth. On the same week Elliott also appeared on air giving a talk about Clarke.

Elliott wrote a full-length biography of Clarke that was published in 1958.

He was also recognised in an episode of the television series &quot;Behind the Legend&quot;.

Clarke&#x27;s contribution to Australian literature is recognised in a number of place names. A main street in Canberra City bears his name. Clarke had a holiday home on the outskirts of Melbourne in what is now the suburb of Dingley Village. Marcus Road and Clarke Road in the suburb commemorate his time there.

In 1973 he was honored on a postage stamp bearing his portrait issued by Australia Post and he is one of the writers commemorated with a plaque on the Sydney Writers Walk.

He was inducted into The Australian Media Hall of Fame in 2017.

<doc id="142238" wikidata="Q124179" url="?curid=142238" title="Kiss (band)">
<text>Kiss (commonly styled as KISS) was an American rock band formed in New York City in 1973 by Paul Stanley (vocals, rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals, bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar, vocals) and Peter Criss (drums, vocals). Known for their face paint and stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid-1970s with shock rock–style live performances which featured fire-breathing, blood-spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and pyrotechnics. The band went through several lineup changes, with Stanley and Simmons remaining the only consistent members. The final lineup consisted of them, Tommy Thayer (lead guitar, vocals) and Eric Singer (drums, vocals).

With their makeup and costumes, the band members took on the personas of comic book-style characters: the Starchild (Stanley), the Demon (Simmons), the Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and the Catman (Criss). During the second half of the 1970s, Kiss became one of America&#x27;s most successful rock bands and a pop culture phenomenon. Due to creative differences, Criss departed the band in 1980, followed by Frehley&#x27;s departure in 1982. They were replaced by Eric Carr (the Fox) and Vinnie Vincent (the Wiz), respectively. The band&#x27;s commercial success had declined during the early 1980s before experiencing a resurgence in 1983, when they began performing without makeup and costumes, marking the beginning of the band&#x27;s &quot;unmasked&quot; era that would last until 1996. The first album of this era, 1983&#x27;s platinum-certified &quot;Lick It Up&quot;, successfully introduced them to a new generation of fans, and its music videos received regular airplay on MTV. Vincent left the band in 1984, being replaced briefly by Mark St. John before Bruce Kulick joined the band for the next twelve years. Eric Carr died in 1991 of heart cancer and was replaced by Eric Singer.

In response to a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the mid-1990s, the original lineup reunited in 1996, which also saw the return of their makeup and stage costumes. The resulting 1996–1997 reunion tour was highly successful, grossing $143.7 million, making it the band&#x27;s most successful tour. Criss and Frehley subsequently left the band again following the 2000–2001 tour, which at the time was intended to be Kiss&#x27;s last. Criss and Frehley were replaced by Singer and Tommy Thayer, who adopted the original Catman and Spaceman makeup respectively, rather than having their own unique makeup designs. In January 2019, Kiss began their final worldwide tour, and retired after performing their final show in New York City in December 2023.

Kiss is regarded as one of the most influential rock bands of all time, as well as one of the best selling bands of all time, claiming to have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, including 21 million RIAA-certified albums. Kiss has also earned 30 Gold albums, the most of any band from the United States. Kiss has 14 Platinum albums, three of which earned multi-Platinum. On April 10, 2014, the four original members of Kiss were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Kiss was ranked by MTV as the ninth &quot;Greatest Metal Band of All Time&quot;, placed tenth on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot; list, as well as being ranked as the third &quot;Best Metal and Hard Rock Live Band of All Time&quot; by &quot;Loudwire&quot; magazine and placed sixteenth by the British magazine Classic Rock on their &quot;The 50 Best Rock Bands of All Time&quot; list.

==History==

===1971–1975: early years===

Kiss traces its roots to Wicked Lester, a New York City–based rock band led by Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. That band recorded one album, which was shelved by Epic Records, and played a handful of live shows. Simmons and Stanley, feeling a new musical direction was needed, abandoned Wicked Lester in 1972 and began forming a new group.

After breaking up Wicked Lester late in 1972, Simmons and Stanley came across an ad in the East Coast version of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed by Peter Criss, a drummer from the New York City scene who had previously played in the bands Lips and Chelsea. Simmons and Stanley met Criss in a nightclub where he was playing drums. After hearing Criss sing, they thought Criss should be in the new band they were forming. Criss then auditioned for, and later joined their new band. The three focused on a much harder style of rock than that played by Wicked Lester. In November 1972, the band played a showcase for Epic Records A&amp;R director Don Ellis, in an effort to secure a record deal. In early January 1973, the group added lead guitarist Ace Frehley. Frehley impressed the group with his first audition, and was asked back for a second audition. A few weeks after Frehley joined, the classic lineup was solidified as the band to be named Kiss. They also began experimenting with their image, by wearing makeup and various outfits.

Stanley came up with the name while he, Simmons, and Criss were driving around New York City. Criss mentioned that he had been in a band called Lips, so Stanley said something to the effect of &quot;What about Kiss?&quot; Frehley created the now-iconic logo, making the &quot;SS&quot; look like lightning bolts, when he went to write the new band name over &quot;Wicked Lester&quot; on a poster outside the club where they were going to play. (Some of Wicked Lester&#x27;s artwork included one lightning bolt for the &quot;S&quot; in Lester.) Later, Stanley designed the logo with a Sharpie and a ruler and accidentally drew the two S&#x27;s nonparallel because he did it &quot;by eye&quot;. The art department asked him if he wanted it to be redrafted to be perfect and he said, &quot;It got us this far, let&#x27;s leave well enough alone. Our number one rule has always been no rules.&quot;

The letters happened to look similar to the insignia of the Nazi SS, a symbol that is outlawed in Germany by Section 86a of the German criminal code. However, Simmons and Stanley, both Jewish, have denied any intentional likeness to Nazi symbolism in the logo. Since 1980, most of the band&#x27;s album covers and merchandise in Germany have used a different logo, in which the letters &quot;SS&quot; look like the letters &quot;ZZ&quot; backwards. This logo is also used in Austria, Switzerland, Lithuania, and Hungary to avoid controversy.

The band&#x27;s name has repeatedly been the subject of rumors pertaining to alleged hidden meanings. Among these rumors are theories that the name is an acronym for &quot;Knights in Satan&#x27;s Service&quot;, &quot;Kinder SS&quot;, or &quot;Kids in Satan&#x27;s Service&quot;. Simmons has denied all of these claims.

The first Kiss performance took place on January 30, 1973, for an audience of fewer than ten people at the Popcorn Club (renamed Coventry shortly afterward) in Queens. The band was paid $50 for performing two sets that evening, following a cold-call Simmons had made to the venue, convincing them to hire the new band for a three-night stand. For the first three gigs, January 30 to February 1, they wore makeup, but the iconic character designs associated with Kiss made their debuts during the March 9–10 shows at The Daisy in Amityville, New York.

On March 13 of that year, the band recorded a five-song demo tape with producer Eddie Kramer. Former TV director Bill Aucoin, who had seen the group at a handful of showcase concerts in the summer of 1973, offered to become the band&#x27;s manager in mid-October. Kiss agreed, with the condition that Aucoin signed the band to a record label within two weeks. On November 1, 1973, Kiss became the first act signed to former teen pop singer and Buddah Records executive Neil Bogart&#x27;s new label, Casablanca Records.

The band entered Bell Sound Studios in New York City on October 10, 1973, to begin recording its first album. On December 31, the band had its official industry premiere at the Academy of Music in New York City, opening for Blue Öyster Cult. It was at this concert that, for the first of many times, Simmons accidentally set his hair (which was coated in hairspray) ablaze while performing his fire-breathing routine.

Kiss&#x27;s first tour started on February 5, 1974, in Edmonton, Alberta, a cafeteria at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology, as an opening act. The band&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released on February 18. Casablanca and Kiss promoted the album heavily throughout the spring and summer of 1974.

On February 19, in its first television appearance, the band performed &quot;Nothin&#x27; to Lose&quot;, &quot;Firehouse&quot; and &quot;Black Diamond&quot; on ABC&#x27;s &quot;In Concert&quot; (aired March 29). On April 29, the band performed &quot;Firehouse&quot; on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;. This broadcast included Simmons&#x27;s first televised interview, a conversation with Mike Douglas in which Simmons declared himself &quot;evil incarnate&quot;, eliciting uncomfortable reactions from a confused studio audience. Fellow Jewish-American guest Totie Fields said it would be humorous if beneath all the makeup Simmons was &quot;just a nice Jewish boy&quot;. Simmons responded, &quot;You should only know&quot;, to which Fields replied, &quot;I do. You can&#x27;t hide the hook&quot;, a reference to the stereotypical &quot;Jewish&quot; nose.

Despite the publicity and constant touring, &quot;Kiss&quot; initially sold just 75,000 copies. Meanwhile, the group and Casablanca Records were losing money quickly. The band (while touring) stopped in Los Angeles in August 1974 to begin recording its second album, &quot;Hotter Than Hell&quot;, which was released on October 22, 1974. The only single, &quot;Let Me Go, Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, failed to chart, and the album stalled at No. 100.

With &quot;Hotter Than Hell&quot; quickly dropping off the charts, Kiss was pulled from its tour to quickly record a new album. Casablanca head Bogart stepped in to produce the next album, trading in the murky, distorted sound of &quot;Hotter Than Hell&quot; for a cleaner and slightly poppier sound. &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot;, released on March 19, 1975, fared slightly better commercially than &quot;Hotter Than Hell&quot;. It also contained what later became the band&#x27;s signature song, &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot;.

Although Kiss albums had not proved to be big sellers, the band was quickly gaining a reputation for its live performances. Kiss concerts featured such spectacles as Simmons spitting &quot;blood&quot; (an effect made primarily from eggs, yogurt, red food coloring, and maple syrup) and &quot;breathing fire&quot; (spitting flammable liquid at a torch), Frehley soloing as his guitar burst into flames (light and smoke bombs placed inside the guitar), Criss&#x27;s elevating drum riser that emitted sparks, Stanley&#x27;s Townshend-style guitar smashing, and pyrotechnics throughout the show.

By mid-1975, Casablanca was almost bankrupt, and Kiss was in danger of losing its record contract. Both parties desperately needed a commercial breakthrough if they were to survive. That breakthrough came in an unlikely form: a &quot;double live&quot; album.

===1975–1978: rise to prominence===


Kiss wanted to express the excitement felt at its concerts (which its studio albums had so far failed to do) with its first live album. Compiled from concerts recorded between May and July in Wildwood, New Jersey, Detroit and Cleveland, and released on September 10, 1975, &quot;Alive!&quot; achieved Gold status and spawned Kiss&#x27;s first top 40 single: a live version of &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot;. It was the first version of the song with a guitar solo, and this recording has become the best-known version. It is also the basis of most covers, such as the cover by Poison in 1987. In recent years the band admitted that additional audience noise had been added to the album, as well as overdubs on select guitar and vocal spots, not to deceive fans, but to add more &quot;excitement and realism&quot; to the record.

The success of &quot;Alive!&quot; not only brought Kiss the breakthrough they had been seeking but arguably saved Casablanca, which was close to bankruptcy. Following this success, Kiss partnered with producer Bob Ezrin, who had previously worked with Alice Cooper. The result was &quot;Destroyer&quot; (released March 15, 1976), Kiss&#x27;s most musically ambitious studio album to date. &quot;Destroyer&quot;, with its rather intricate production (using an orchestra, choir, and numerous tape effects), was a departure from the raw sound of the first three studio albums. Album art was designed by Ken Kelly, who had drawn Tarzan and Conan the Barbarian and also produced album covers for acts such as Rainbow and Manowar. While the album sold well initially and became the group&#x27;s second Gold album, it quickly dropped down the charts. Only when the ballad &quot;Beth&quot;, the B-side of the single &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;, began to gain more airplay on FM radio did the album&#x27;s sales rebound. The single was subsequently reissued with the A- and B-sides reversed. &quot;Beth&quot; peaked at No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming the band&#x27;s first Top 10 single in the United States.
In October 1976, Kiss appeared on &quot;The Paul Lynde Halloween Special&quot; (aired on ABC the 29th), lip-synching &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;, &quot;Beth&quot; and &quot;King of the Night Time World&quot;. The show, co-produced by Bill Aucoin, helped introduce Kiss to an even wider audience. In addition to the three songs, Kiss was the subject of a brief comedic &quot;interview&quot; conducted by Paul Lynde. This included Lynde noting, when hearing the member&#x27;s first names, &quot;Oh, I love a good religious group.&quot;

Two more highly successful studio albums were released in less than a year: &quot;Rock and Roll Over&quot; (November 11, 1976) and &quot;Love Gun&quot; (June 30, 1977). A second live album, &quot;Alive II&quot;, was released on October 14, 1977. All three albums were certified Platinum soon after their release. Between 1976 and 1978, Kiss earned $17.7 million from record royalties and music publishing. A 1977 Gallup poll named Kiss the most popular band in America. In Japan, Kiss performed five sold-out shows at Tokyo&#x27;s Budokan Hall, equaling the record set by the Beatles in 1966 with their five concerts there.

In May 1977, Kiss made the first of its many comic book appearances, in &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; issue 12, published by Marvel Comics.

The first Kiss compilation album, &quot;Double Platinum&quot;, was issued on April 2, 1978. This double album included many remixed versions of the band&#x27;s hits, as well as &quot;Strutter &#x27;78&quot;, a re-recorded version of a song from the group&#x27;s first album. At Bogart&#x27;s request, this version of the song featured a disco influence.

During this period, Kiss merchandise became a substantial source of income for the group. Some of the products released included a pair of comic books issued by Marvel (the first contained ink mixed with actual blood donated by the group), a pinball machine, dolls, &quot;Kiss Your Face Makeup&quot; kits, Halloween masks, board games, lunch boxes, trading cards and many other pieces of memorabilia. Membership in the Kiss Army, the band&#x27;s fan club, was in the six figures. Between 1977 and 1979, worldwide merchandise sales (in-store and on tour) reached an estimated $100 million.

===1978: Solo and film projects===

&quot;Alive II&quot; was the band&#x27;s fourth Platinum album in just under two years, and the ensuing tour had the highest average attendance in the group&#x27;s history. In addition, Kiss&#x27;s gross income for 1977 was $10.2 million. The group, along with manager Aucoin, sought to push the brand harder. To that end, an ambitious, two-pronged strategy was devised for 1978.

The first part involved the simultaneous release of four solo albums from the members of Kiss. Although Kiss has claimed that the solo albums were intended to ease rising tensions within the band, its 1976 record contract did in fact call for four solo records, each of them counting as half an album toward the group&#x27;s five-record commitment. Each album was a solo effort (none of the group appeared on another&#x27;s album), however all were released and marketed as Kiss albums (with similar cover art and poster inserts). It was the first time that all current members of a rock band had released solo albums on the same day.

For the band members, it was a chance to showcase their individual musical styles and tastes outside of Kiss, and in some cases to collaborate with contemporary artists. Stanley&#x27;s and Frehley&#x27;s albums were most similar to Kiss&#x27;s hard rock style, while Criss&#x27;s album featured an R&amp;B style including ballads. Simmons&#x27; was the most diverse of the four, featuring hard rock, ballads, Beatles-influenced pop and a cover version of &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; from the Disney film &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. Simmons&#x27; many collaborators included Aerosmith&#x27;s Joe Perry, Cheap Trick&#x27;s Rick Nielsen, the Doobie Brothers&#x27; Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter, Donna Summer, Janis Ian, Helen Reddy, Bob Seger, Katey Sagal, and his then-girlfriend Cher.

The solo albums were released on September 18, 1978. Casablanca spent $2.5 million on the marketing campaign for the albums, and announced they were shipping five million copies, guaranteeing Platinum status. Despite the large shipments, none of the albums sold particularly well and were later sold as cut-outs. Of the four, Simmons&#x27;s album charted the highest in the U.S., peaking at #22, while Frehley&#x27;s spawned the only resulting Top Forty hit single, a cover of &quot;New York Groove&quot;, written by Russ Ballard and originally performed by Hello. Frehley&#x27;s album has gone on to be the biggest seller since the introduction of Soundscan in 1991.

The second part of Kiss&#x27;s and Aucoin&#x27;s plan called for the band to appear in a film that would cement its image of larger-than-life rock-and-roll superheroes. Filming commenced in the spring of 1978. Although the project was proposed to the band as a cross between &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the final result fell far short of those expectations. The final product, &quot;Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park&quot;, debuted on NBC on October 28, 1978. It was released theatrically, after many changes, outside the U.S. in 1979 under the title &quot;Attack of the Phantoms&quot;. The band members were unhappy with the finished film and would speak about their filmmaking experience in later interviews with a mix of humorous embarrassment and regret. They felt that the film portrayed them more as clowns than superheroes. The artistic failure of the film led to a rift between the band and Aucoin.

===1979–1983: final makeup years===
Kiss&#x27;s first album of new material in two years, &quot;Dynasty&quot; (1979), continued the band&#x27;s Platinum streak. The disco-flavored &quot;I Was Made for Lovin&#x27; You&quot; became one of the band&#x27;s biggest hit singles to date, peaking at No. 11. Session drummer Anton Fig performed almost all the percussion on the album while Criss recovered from an automobile accident. The only song to feature Criss&#x27;s drumming was &quot;Dirty Livin&#x27;&quot;, on which he also sang lead. The album is also notable due to Frehley singing three lead vocals versus Simmons two, which he put down to increased confidence following the success of his solo album.

Billed as &quot;The Return of Kiss&quot;, the Dynasty Tour was expected by Kiss and their management to build on the success of previous tours. Plans were drawn up for a Kiss-themed traveling amusement park called &quot;Kiss World&quot;, but were abandoned because of the immense costs involved; however, &quot;The Return of Kiss&quot; saw a marked decline in attendance.
The crowds on this tour were much younger than previous audiences had been, with many preadolescent children in Kiss makeup with their mothers and fathers (who were sometimes wearing the makeup themselves) in tow at most concerts. Kiss themselves did little to dissuade this new fan base, donning colorful costumes that reinforced a cartoonish image for these younger fans.

The fans were unaware of the dissension within the band. One very public indication of the heightened friction within the group was an infamous October 31, 1979, interview on Tom Snyder&#x27;s late-night &quot;The Tomorrow Show&quot;. During the episode, a visibly irritated Simmons and Stanley attempted, unsuccessfully, to contain the inebriated Frehley, whose frequent laughter and joking overshadowed the conversation between Snyder and the rest of the band. Criss made references to his large gun collection, to the chagrin of Simmons.

By the end of the &quot;Dynasty&quot; tour in December 1979, tensions between Criss and the rest of the band were at an all-time high. His drumming skills had noticeably eroded, and he even intentionally slowed down—or stopped playing altogether—during some concerts. The final show of the tour (December 16, 1979) was the last time Criss performed with the group for almost 17 years, although he remained an official member for nearly six more months.

While Criss appeared on the cover of the next album, &quot;Unmasked&quot;, Anton Fig was the actual drummer, although he was not credited. Showcasing a slick, contemporary pop sound, &quot;Unmasked&quot; (released May 20, 1980) had the dubious distinction of being the first non-Platinum Kiss album since &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot;. Soon after the album&#x27;s release, Criss&#x27;s departure was officially announced. Fig, considered a member of Kiss for one day following the departure of Criss, was then fired by Stanley and Simmons, who felt he was not a good fit for the band. He would ultimately join Paul Shaffer and the World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Band, acting as the drummer for David Letterman&#x27;s television programs until the host&#x27;s retirement.

The band auditioned dozens of replacements for Criss in June 1980. One of the many who auditioned was Tico Torres (who would later be with Bon Jovi). They finally settled on a little-known drummer-guitarist-pianist-keyboardist-singer from Brooklyn named Paul Charles Caravello (born July 12, 1950) who adopted the stage name Eric Carr. His first makeup design was modeled on a hawk, though it was rejected when Stanley and Aucoin saw Carr in the bright yellow costume Kiss had designed for the new drummer. Carr created the &quot;Fox&quot; persona by the middle of July. In his Fox makeup, Carr debuted with the group on July 25, 1980, at the Palladium concert hall in New York City. This was Kiss&#x27;s only U.S. show in support of &quot;Unmasked&quot;. On July 30, 1980, Kiss introduced Carr on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Kids Are People Too!&quot;, which would air in September. The band&#x27;s 1980 tour of Australia and New Zealand, on the other hand, was one of the biggest in its history, as they played to sold-out crowds and received overwhelmingly positive press coverage.

For its next album, the band worked again with producer Ezrin, with whom Kiss had found success on &quot;Destroyer&quot;. Early press reports indicated that the new album would be a return to the hard rock style that had originally brought the band success. However, 1981&#x27;s &quot;Music from &quot;The Elder&quot;&quot; was a concept album featuring medieval horns, strings, harps, and synthesizers.

The album was presented as a soundtrack to a film that was never made, making it difficult to follow the storyline. To make matters worse, having received negative feedback following its record company&#x27;s preview of the album, Kiss altered the record&#x27;s track sequence in most countries to emphasize potential singles &quot;The Oath&quot; and &quot;A World Without Heroes&quot;, which all but guaranteed the inability of listeners to understand the already-muddled storyline. Once released, fan reaction to &quot;The Elder&quot; was harsh; it failed to achieve Gold status and peaked at No. 75 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart.

The band made only two appearances in support of the new album, both in January 1982. One was a performance on the ABC late-night variety program &quot;Fridays&quot;, while the second was a lip-synced performance that was broadcast via satellite during Italy&#x27;s Sanremo Music Festival.

Absent from the satellite performance was Frehley, who had become increasingly frustrated with Kiss&#x27;s new musical direction. Upset with the band&#x27;s decision to record &quot;Music from &quot;The Elder&quot;&quot;, he did not actively participate in the album&#x27;s creation (despite recording solos on it), providing lead vocals for only one track, &quot;Dark Light&quot;. He did not appear at a special concert at Studio 54 in New York City, leaving Kiss to perform as a trio. He recorded his guitar parts at his home studio in Wilton, Connecticut, and mailed them to Ezrin. Another source of frustration for Frehley was that with the departure of Criss, and with Carr not being an equal partner in the band, he was often outvoted 2-to-1 on group decisions. In June 1982, Frehley&#x27;s departure from the band was negotiated, although he did not officially leave until December.

Simmons stated in his autobiography &quot;Kiss and Make-Up&quot; that Van Halen founder Eddie Van Halen was eager to replace Frehley as Kiss&#x27;s lead guitarist. Simmons and Eddie&#x27;s brother Alex convinced Eddie to remain with Van Halen. Eddie was willing to break up Van Halen due to tensions between himself and lead vocalist David Lee Roth, who ultimately left the band in 1985. Paul Stanley, however, has since denied the rumors of Eddie Van Halen wanting to join Kiss. Other notable guitarists who auditioned to replace Frehley included Punky Meadows of Angel, Doug Aldrich of Whitesnake, Richie Sambora of Bon Jovi, Yngwie Malmsteen, and Slash of Guns N&#x27; Roses.

Soon afterward, Kiss made major changes to its business dealings – chief among them was severing ties with its manager of nine years, Bill Aucoin, and cutting back on its unwieldy organizational tree. Although Frehley had already decided to leave the band, he was pictured on the covers of 1982&#x27;s &quot;Killers&quot; and &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot;, although he did not participate in the recording of either album.

&quot;Creatures of the Night&quot; (October 13, 1982) was Kiss&#x27;s heaviest album to date, and although it fared better than &quot;Music from &quot;The Elder&quot;&quot;, it peaked at only No. 45 on the charts and was not certified Gold until 1994. In Frehley&#x27;s absence, Kiss utilized a number of guitarists for the recording of the album, especially Vinnie Vincent, who played on six tracks.

Frehley&#x27;s last appearance with the band (until the 1996 reunion) was in the music video for the single &quot;I Love It Loud&quot;, which was co-written by Vincent. Frehley also appeared on the cover of the original &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot; album artwork. When the album was remixed and re-released in 1985 with a non-makeup cover and a slightly different song order, to reflect the band&#x27;s roster change and abandonment of its makeup and costumes, Vincent was again absent from the album cover, as then-current lead guitarist, Bruce Kulick, appeared instead. The liner notes accompanying the remixed LP, however, credited both Frehley and Vincent with lead guitar performances on the &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot; album. Vincent officially replaced Frehley as lead guitarist in December 1982, as the band embarked on its 10th Anniversary Tour.

Vincent originally wanted to use his birth name (Cusano) in the band, but this was vetoed by Simmons on the grounds that it sounded &quot;too ethnic&quot;. Specifically, according to Simmons, &quot;it sounded like a fruit vendor&quot;. Simmons went on to note that &quot;fairly or unfairly, rock and roll is about the image&quot;. Vincent then suggested the name &quot;Mick Fury&quot;, but this was also disallowed. Simmons later suggested the name change to &quot;Vinnie Vincent&quot;. Vincent started actively pushing to join Kiss as a full member. Despite the misgivings that both Simmons and Stanley harbored about his personality, Vincent was taken into the band. Stanley designed a character, &quot;the Wiz&quot; also known as &quot;the Egyptian Warrior&quot;, and makeup centered around an Egyptian ankh, for Vincent. According to the official authorized Kiss biography, written by David Leaf and Ken Sharp, &quot;the Egyptian Ankh Warrior&quot; refers to Vincent&#x27;s makeup and persona, while the nickname &quot;the Wiz&quot; refers to his virtuosity as a guitar player. According to the Simmons autobiography &quot;Kiss and Make-Up&quot;, Vincent&#x27;s Kiss persona was solely &quot;the Wiz&quot;. A persona as &quot;the Ankh Warrior&quot; or similar is not mentioned in the book at all.

From 1982 to 1983, the new lineup of Kiss became Simmons (the Demon), Stanley (the Starchild), Eric Carr (the Fox) and Vincent (the Wiz).

Vincent&#x27;s personality did not mesh well with either Stanley or Simmons, and he was dismissed from Kiss at the end of the &quot;Creatures&quot; tour. He was quickly reinstated before recording started for &quot;Lick It Up&quot; because Simmons and Stanley could not find a new lead guitarist on such short notice. Vincent appeared on the cover of &quot;Lick It Up&quot; and was credited as the lead guitarist. He received a writing credit for eight of the ten songs on the album.

Personality issues arose once again, and Vincent was fired following the &quot;Lick It Up&quot; tour, due in part to excessive guitar soloing at a 1984 concert in Quebec. He was replaced by Mark St. John. Vincent was later utilized by Kiss as a songwriter on the 1992 album &quot;Revenge&quot;, contributing to the songs &quot;Unholy&quot;, &quot;Tough Love&quot;, &quot;Heart of Chrome&quot; and &quot;I Just Wanna&quot;. Vincent and the band parted ways. Persistent rumors circulated for years among Kiss fans regarding the true reason for Vincent&#x27;s dismissals from Kiss, with at least one band member refusing to comment except to say that legally it was not up for discussion. Simmons stated in an interview several years later that Vincent&#x27;s firing was for &quot;unethical behavior&quot;, but he did not elaborate:

===1983–1996: unmasking===

Sensing it was time for a change, Kiss made the decision to abandon their trademark makeup and costumes. The band officially appeared in public without makeup for the first time since their very early days on a September 18, 1983, appearance on MTV, which coincided with the release of &quot;Lick It Up&quot;. The tour to promote the new album and the unmasked band members began in Lisbon, Portugal, on October 11, 1983, at Pavilhão Dramático de Cascais, the band&#x27;s first concert without makeup since early 1973. &quot;Lick It Up&quot; became Kiss&#x27;s first Gold record in three years, but the tour was even more sparsely attended than the previous one. Vincent did not get along with Simmons and Stanley, and he left the band at the conclusion of the tour in March 1984. Vincent&#x27;s replacement was Mark St. John, a session player and guitar tutor.

With St. John, Kiss released the album &quot;Animalize&quot; on September 13, 1984. &quot;Animalize&quot; followed the success of &quot;Lick It Up&quot;, and due in part to consistent MTV play for the &quot;Heaven&#x27;s on Fire&quot; video, &quot;Animalize&quot; was the band&#x27;s bestselling record in America during the decade, with over two million albums sold. With the success of the album and subsequent tour, Kiss had recaptured some of its earlier glory (though not to the level of its 1970s heyday). St. John, however, came down with reactive arthritis during tour rehearsals, and only performed at a handful of shows before being dismissed from the band in December 1984, with one of these shows being at the Mid-Hudson Civic Center in Poughkeepsie, New York which was recorded on November 28, 1984. The band hired Bruce Kulick to replace St. John. Kulick had previously filled in for St. John during the first two months of the &quot;Animalize&quot; tour. Kulick was Kiss&#x27;s fourth lead guitarist in less than three years, but he stayed with the band for 12 years. Kulick became one of the band&#x27;s longest-serving members, with the longest continuous tenure of anyone other than Simmons and Stanley, until Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer broke his record in 2014 and 2016 respectively.

One of the first concerts Kulick played as an official member of the band was at Detroit, Michigan&#x27;s Cobo Hall. It was filmed for the MTV special &quot;Animalize Live&quot;.

The lineup of Stanley, Simmons, Carr and Kulick turned out to be the most stable since the original, and for the rest of the 1980s, Kiss released a series of Platinum albums: 1985&#x27;s &quot;Asylum&quot;, 1987&#x27;s &quot;Crazy Nights&quot; and the 1988 greatest hits compilation &quot;Smashes, Thrashes &amp; Hits&quot;. &quot;Crazy Nights&quot;, in particular, was one of Kiss&#x27;s most successful albums overseas. The single &quot;Crazy Crazy Nights&quot; reached No. 4 on the singles chart in the United Kingdom, the band&#x27;s highest-charting single in that country.

Kiss ended the decade with the October 1989 release &quot;Hot in the Shade&quot;. Although the album failed to achieve Platinum status, it spawned the hit ballad &quot;Forever&quot;, co-written by Michael Bolton. Peaking at No. 8 in the US, it was the group&#x27;s highest-charting single since &quot;Beth&quot; and was the band&#x27;s second Top 10 single.

During this time, Kiss struggled with its identity and fan base. Simmons, arguably the driving force in Kiss during the 1970s, became less involved with the group in the 1980s as he pursued outside interests, most notably a film career. Stanley took a more prominent role as a result.

In February 1991, the band decided to once again enlist Ezrin to produce its next album. Before recording could begin in earnest, however, tragedy struck. In March 1991, it was discovered that Carr had a tumor on his heart. It was successfully removed the following month, but more tumors were soon discovered in his lungs. Carr received chemotherapy and was pronounced cancer-free in July. However, in September he suffered the first of two cerebral hemorrhages. He died on November 24, 1991, at the age of 41.

Despite the tragic loss of a longtime member, Kiss continued, introducing veteran drummer Eric Singer (born Eric Doyle Mensinger on May 12, 1958, in Cleveland, Ohio). Singer had played with Paul Stanley previously, as part of Stanley&#x27;s backing band during a 1989 solo tour.

Kiss released &quot;Revenge&quot; on May 19, 1992. It featured a leaner, harder-edged sound, as indicated by the first single, &quot;Unholy&quot;. In a surprise move, Kiss enlisted Vincent to help with songwriting duties. The album debuted in the Top 10 and went Gold. Kiss embarked on a brief club tour of the U.S. in the spring of 1992, before beginning an American tour in September 1992. The tour was documented on the album &quot;Alive III&quot;, released on May 14, 1993. Four days later, Kiss were inducted into Hollywood&#x27;s RockWalk.

In 1995, the group released the book &quot;Kisstory&quot;, a 440-page, , detailed chronicle of the group&#x27;s history to that point. That same year, the band embarked on a unique and well-received Worldwide Kiss Convention Tour. The conventions were all-day events, featuring displays of vintage Kiss stage outfits, instruments and memorabilia; performances by Kiss cover bands; and dealers selling Kiss merchandise from every stage of the band&#x27;s career. Kiss appeared live at the conventions, conducted question and answer sessions, signed autographs, and performed a two-hour acoustic set composed mostly of spontaneous fan requests. On the first U.S. date (June 17, 1995), Criss appeared onstage with Kiss to sing &quot;Hard Luck Woman&quot; and &quot;Nothin&#x27; to Lose&quot;. It was the first time Criss had performed publicly with the band in nearly 16 years.

===1996–2001: original lineup reunion tour and remasking===
On August 9, 1995, Kiss joined the long line of musicians to perform on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;. The band contacted Criss and Frehley and invited them to participate in the event. Both joined Kiss on stage for several songs at the end of the set: &quot;Beth&quot;, &quot;2000 Man&quot;, &quot;Nothin&#x27; to Lose&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot;. The &quot;Unplugged&quot; appearance set off months of speculation that a possible reunion of the original Kiss lineup was in the works. In the weeks following the &quot;Unplugged&quot; concert, however, the band (with Kulick and Singer) returned to the studio for the first time in three years to record a follow-up to &quot;Revenge&quot;. &quot;Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions&quot; was completed in February 1996, but its release was delayed for almost two years. Bootleg copies of the album circulated widely among fans. While Kiss continued to exist publicly as Simmons, Stanley, Kulick and Singer, arrangements for a reunion of the original lineup were in the works. These efforts culminated with a public event as dramatic as any the band had staged since its 1983 unmasking on MTV. With the following statements, Tupac Shakur introduced the original Kiss lineup, in full makeup and &quot;Love Gun&quot;-era stage outfits, to a rousing ovation at the 38th Annual Grammy Awards:

On April 16, the band members held a press conference aboard the in New York City, where they announced their plans for a full-fledged reunion tour, with the help of new manager Doc McGhee. The conference, MC&#x27;d by Conan O&#x27;Brien, was simulcast to 58 countries. On April 20, nearly 40,000 tickets for the tour&#x27;s first show sold out in 47 minutes.

The first public concert featuring the newly reunited Kiss was an hour-long warm-up show on June 15 for the annual KROQ Weenie Roast in Irvine, California, during which the band nearly ignited the stage of the Irvine Meadows Amphitheater. On June 28, the Kiss Alive/Worldwide Tour began at Tiger Stadium in Detroit in front of a sold-out crowd of 39,867 fans. The tour lasted for 192 shows over the course of one year and earned $43.6 million, making Kiss the top-drawing concert act of 1996. The average attendance of 13,737 is the highest in the group&#x27;s history.

In September 1998, the reunited group issued &quot;Psycho Circus&quot;. Although it was the first album with the original lineup since 1979&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty&quot;, the contributions of Frehley and Criss were minimal. While the images of Frehley and Criss are featured prominently on the album, most of the lead guitar work was later revealed to have been performed by future band member Tommy Thayer. Former member Kulick made an appearance on the intro of the song &quot;Within&quot;. Most drum duties were handled by session musician Kevin Valentine. Despite the controversy, the album achieved a No. 3 chart debut, the highest position for a Kiss album until &quot;Sonic Boom&quot; debuted at No. 2 in 2009. The title track received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. The Psycho Circus Tour opened at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles on Halloween in 1998, and was simulcast on FM radio across the U.S. It proved to be another success, and was historic for being the first to ever incorporate 3D visuals into a stage show.

On August 11, 1999, Kiss was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, in the &quot;Recording Industry&quot; category. The next month, the group worked in collaboration with World Championship Wrestling to produce a Kiss-themed wrestler known as the Demon, whose face was painted to resemble Simmons&#x27; makeup. The group performed &quot;God of Thunder&quot; live on &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; to debut the character. The band received $500,000 for the one-night, one-song performance.

Kiss launched a U.S. Farewell Tour in March 2000. The group quickly added dates to the tour, which ran through April 2001.

===2001–2008: post-reunion===
On the eve of the Japanese and Australian leg of the Farewell Tour on January 31, 2001, Criss suddenly left the band once again, because he and the band could not come to agreement with his contract salary. Taking his place was previous Kiss drummer Singer who assumed Criss&#x27;s Cat persona as the Farewell Tour continued.

With the band supposedly set to retire by early 2001, a career-encompassing collection entitled simply &quot;The Box Set&quot;, consisting of 94 tracks on five CDs, was released in November of that year, while the summer saw perhaps the most outrageous item of Kiss merchandise yet – the Kiss Kasket. In introducing the Kiss Kasket, Simmons quipped, &quot;I love livin&#x27;, but this makes the alternative look pretty damn good.&quot;

On December 4, 2001, Kiss was one of the honorees at the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (&quot;The Recording Academy&quot;) Heroes Award ceremony, at the NARAS New York Chapter. NARAS has 12 chapters throughout the United States, hence 12 ceremonies throughout the year, with the honorees each being honored by the chapter closest to their residence. By receiving this honor, which NARAS has renamed the &quot;Recording Academy Honors&quot;, Kiss effectively received NARAS&#x27;s second-highest career honor, right behind the Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award.

Kiss was relatively quiet through the rest of the year, but 2002 started with some controversy as Simmons took part in a controversial interview on National Public Radio with host Terry Gross. In February 2002, Kiss (with Singer on drums and Frehley on lead guitar) performed during the closing ceremony of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah which was Frehley&#x27;s final performance as a member of Kiss.

On March 6, 2002, Kiss performed a private concert at a resort in Trelawny, Jamaica. Frehley, who was no longer under contract, did not perform with the group. He was replaced by Thayer, who donned Frehley&#x27;s Spaceman makeup and costume for his first live appearance with Kiss. That month, the band (with Thayer) taped an appearance on the American sitcom &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;. The episode, &quot;That &#x27;70s Kiss Show&quot;, aired in August 2002. Thayer again performed with the group in April 2002, when Kiss performed &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; (with pre-recorded music and live vocals) for an appearance on &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s American Bandstand 50th Anniversary&quot; show, which aired on May 3.

In February 2003, Kiss traveled to Australia and recorded &quot;Kiss Symphony: Alive IV&quot; with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra at Marvel Stadium (then known as Telstra Dome) in Melbourne. Thayer once again replaced Frehley, while Criss returned to the group, as one of the conditions set forth by promoters required the band&#x27;s lineup to include at least three original members.

Despite claims made prior to the Farewell Tour that it would be the group&#x27;s last, Kiss toured with Aerosmith in 2003. Frehley announced that his departure from the band was permanent, stating that he believed the Farewell Tour would be Kiss&#x27;s last, and declined Simmons&#x27; invitation to join the band on the Aerosmith tour. He was permanently replaced by Thayer, as Kiss moved into a post-reunion phase that saw the band easing into a new lineup, permanently featuring Thayer as &quot;Spaceman&quot; and Singer as &quot;the Catman&quot;. On this tour, still featuring Criss, the group introduced the &quot;Platinum&quot; tickets package, with the most expensive packages costing $1,000. This package included a seat in the first five rows, a meet-and-greet with Kiss after their performance and a photograph with the band. The tour earned more than $64 million in 2003, which ranked seventh for the year.
Simmons and Stanley did not renew Criss&#x27;s contract when it expired in March 2004. Criss, on his website, stated that &quot;No one, again, no one has called me, or my attorney about an extension for future touring. As a founding member I find this to be disrespectful to me, and to the fans that have made us one of the biggest bands in the world.&quot; Eric Singer once again replaced Criss.

In mid-2004, Kiss headlined the Rock the Nation 2004 World Tour, with Poison as the opening act. The tour ended in August with a sold-out show in Mexico City. Selected dates on the tour were filmed for the &quot;Rock the Nation Live!&quot; concert DVD, released on December 13, 2005. Stanley, who had been experiencing increasing difficulty with his hip, had his mobility limited during the tour. He has already had two hip surgeries performed, with more likely in the future.

After the conclusion of the Rock the Nation Tour, Kiss performed only sporadically for a number of years. The group played two shows in 2005, and another six in 2006. Four of the 2006 shows were July concerts in Japan, including two dates (July 22 and 23) as a headlining act at the 2006 Udo Music Festival. Kiss performed four July 2007 concerts, three of which were dubbed the Hit &#x27;N Run Tour. Prior to the final show on July 27, Stanley was hospitalized with an extremely rapid heartbeat. In his absence, Kiss performed in concert as a trio for the first time since 1982. This was the first Kiss concert that Stanley had missed during his then 34-year tenure with the group.

Kiss (along with Queen, Def Leppard and Judas Priest) were honored at the inaugural &quot;VH1 Rock Honors&quot; event, held May 25, 2006, in Las Vegas. In June 2006, Simmons and Stanley attended the opening of the Kiss Coffeehouse in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. On October 15, 2006, Simmons, Stanley and Criss were inaugural inductees into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame, along with performers such as Neil Diamond, Billy Joel, Louis Armstrong, the Ramones and Tony Bennett.

Stanley released his second solo album, &quot;Live to Win&quot;, on October 24, 2006, and undertook a brief solo tour in support. On October 31 the same year, the group released &quot;Kissology Volume One: 1974–1977&quot;, the first of 10 possible DVD sets featuring complete concert footage, interviews and never-before-seen clips. By January 2007, the set had been certified 5× Platinum in the United States. A second volume was released on August 14, 2007. It was certified 6× Platinum by the RIAA on October 24. What seemed to be the final entry, &quot;Kissology Volume Three: 1992–2000&quot;, was released on December 18, 2007, and has been certified 8× Platinum by the R.I.A.A.

In April 2007, former guitarist St. John died from an apparent cerebral hemorrhage at age 51. After being forced to leave Kiss in 1984, St. John formed the short-lived glam metal group White Tiger.

Though Kiss had been eligible for enshrinement in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame since 1999, they were not nominated until 2009 and were not inducted until 2014. While this snub displeased some fans, Stanley and Simmons maintained that it was meaningless to them. Nevertheless, a group of about 200 Kiss fans held a protest rally in front of the Hall of Fame in Cleveland on August 5, 2006. It was the first known organized demonstration seeking the induction of a band into the Hall.
In 2007, a new comic book series featuring the band was released by the Kiss Comics Group in association with Platinum Studios, titled &quot;Kiss 4K: Legends Never Die&quot;.

The band picked up their pace in 2008, embarking on their first proper tour of Europe in nearly a decade. On January 30, 2008, Stanley confirmed that Kiss would launch the Kiss Alive/35 World Tour, playing arena and stadium shows in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. On March 16, 2008, Kiss closed the Australian Grand Prix at Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit as well as performing in Brisbane and Sydney as part of this tour. Kiss played at the Rock2Wgtn two-day festival held in Wellington, New Zealand, on March 22 and 23, 2008; the festival also featured Ozzy Osbourne, Whitesnake, Poison, Alice Cooper, Lordi, Sonic Altar and Symphony of Screams, with special effects provided by WETA Workshop (of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;King Kong&quot; fame).

Throughout the summer of 2008, Kiss headlined festivals as well as their own shows and played to a record audience of about 400,000 people. As part of this tour, Kiss headlined the Download Festival at England&#x27;s Donington Park on June 13. Three days later, they headlined the Arrow Rock Festival in Nijmegen, Netherlands. On June 28, Kiss headlined the Graspop Metal Meeting in Dessel, Belgium. It was the last show of the European leg of the Kiss Alive/35 Tour. On August 4, Kiss played at Rockin&#x27; the Rally at the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally as part of the tour. South Dakota Governor Mike Rounds proclaimed August 4, 2008, to be &quot;Kiss Rock and Roll Day&quot; in South Dakota. In September 2008, both Simmons and Stanley confirmed rumors that the Kiss Alive/35 Tour would continue with extensive tours of North America in the beginning of 2009, as well as South America. The latter tour included shows on April 5 in Argentina, April 7 and 8 in Brazil, April 11 in Colombia, April 14 in Peru, and other concerts in Venezuela and Chile. That summer, Kiss came back to North America to continue the Alive/35 World Tour, starting on July 18 in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

===2008–2012: &quot;Sonic Boom&quot; and &quot;Monster&quot;===
More than 10 years after their last studio album, and following years of denials about ever wanting to do a new album, Stanley and Simmons changed their minds. In November 2008, Stanley stated to rock photographer Ross Halfin that a new Kiss album was in the works. Stanley himself would be the producer, and the album would have a &quot;real 70s Kiss sound&quot; to it. Later that month, Simmons and Stanley both publicly confirmed the information about a new Kiss album:

The band appeared on &quot;American Idol&quot; in May 2009, performing &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot; with Adam Lambert.

In October 2009, a new studio album, titled &quot;Sonic Boom&quot;, was released. It included a CD of new material, re-recorded versions of famous Kiss hits (previously released as &quot;Jigoku-Retsuden&quot;, a Japanese exclusive album in 2008) and a live DVD recorded in Buenos Aires, Argentina. &quot;Modern Day Delilah&quot; was released as the lead single from &quot;Sonic Boom&quot; on August 19, 2009. The song was Kiss&#x27;s first single release in 11 years, since 1998&#x27;s &quot;You Wanted the Best&quot;. The song gained positive feedback from both critics and fans, and was compared to the band&#x27;s 1970s work. In support of the new album, Kiss appeared live on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on October 6, 2009, and on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; on October 7, 2009. &quot;Sonic Boom&quot; debuted at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

On September 25, 2009, the Kiss Alive/35 North American Tour kicked off at Cobo Hall in Detroit; both nights were filmed for future DVD release. These were the band&#x27;s final performances there, as the venue was later closed as part of the renovation of the Cobo Center. Kiss headlined the 2009 Voodoo Experience held at City Park in New Orleans, Louisiana, on Halloween night. During their performance at the MTS Centre on November 9, 2009, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, one of the lighting trusses caught on fire from a pyro cue. The truss had to be lowered in order to have the fire put out. During the five or so minutes it took to extinguish the fire, the band broke into the song &quot;Firehouse&quot;. No one was hurt and the show continued.

Kiss started the European leg of the Sonic Boom Over Europe Tour in May 2010. Tragedy struck Kiss for a third time when former manager Aucoin died of cancer on June 28, 2010, at the age of 66. Stanley and Simmons said he was like the fifth member of Kiss. The tour included their first UK arena shows in 11 years and their first visit to Slovakia. Kiss later played at two dates in US cities Cheyenne, Wyoming and the North Dakota State Fair in Minot, North Dakota, in July 2010. They also played at the Indiana State Fair in August and the Minnesota State Fair in September. They also made a brief appearance at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in Saratoga Springs, New York, on August 17, 2010. On July 23, Kiss started The Hottest Show on Earth Tour in the United States.

On April 13, 2011, Kiss began recording a new album due for release later in the year. Simmons stated, the album &quot;is gonna be the next step to &quot;Sonic Boom&quot;. Very similar – straight rock songs, no ballads, no keyboards, no nothing, just rock.&quot; The band also used old analog equipment instead of more popular digital recording gear. Simmons said: &quot;Technology is a seductive bitch, she will seduce you. You press this button, you don&#x27;t have to do anything. But analog is the love of your life. You can push real hard and it always gives back. For the new album, the actual recording process was 24-track tape and an old Trident board. And as many tubes as possible. You need tubes, electricity and thick wood to make that thick sound.&quot;
Kiss spent the summer of 2011 playing venues in the US and Canada, visiting cities they had not played in some time; it was dubbed the &quot;Lost Cities Tour&quot;. Their next album &quot;Monster&quot; was released in October 2012. KISS by Monster Mini Golf was opened in March 2012 in Las Vegas. The facility is an 18-hole indoor miniature golf course, featuring arcade games, a gift shop, and numerous pieces of band memorabilia on display. The complete current version of the band attended the grand opening.

Kiss appeared on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; on March 20, 2012. A press conference was held on the same day to announce a summer North American tour called The Tour, co-headlined by Mötley Crüe. The Tour started on July 20 and ended on October 1. The single &quot;Hell or Hallelujah&quot; was released internationally on July 2, 2012, and on July 3 in North America. &quot;Monster&quot; was released on October 9, 2012, in North America.

Kiss kicked off the Monster World Tour on November 7, 2012, in Buenos Aires, Argentina at the River Plate Stadium and continued the six-date South American leg with dates in Santiago, Asunción, Porto Alegre, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro until November 18. The Australian leg began on February 28, 2013, in Perth at the Perth Arena and ran through March 16 in Mackay at Virgin Australian Stadium. They were joined by Mötley Crüe, Thin Lizzy and Diva Demolition. The band extensively toured Europe and Canada with a few US dates in June through August, and then Japan in October.

===2013–2015: 40th anniversary, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and international collaboration===

On October 16, 2013, Kiss was again announced as a nominee for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and was subsequently announced as an inductee on December 17.

In 2013, Kiss purchased a share of an Arena Football League expansion franchise set to begin play at the Honda Center in Anaheim, California, in 2014. Simmons, Stanley and manager McGhee jointly owned the team, called the Los Angeles Kiss. Both Simmons and Stanley are known fans of the AFL. The LA Kiss offered National Football League free agent quarterback Tim Tebow a contract to join their team and play in the AFL, but he did not join. The team folded in 2016. Bizarrely, Simmons was also an &quot;owner for a day&quot; of the Carlton Football Club, a team that participates in the Australian Football League and which is also commonly abbreviated to AFL, although this purchase was unofficial and purportedly done for tax purposes, according to Simmons. Simmons has nevertheless been a fan of Carlton and Australian rules football since at least 2008.

In 2014, Kiss toured as co-headliners with Def Leppard. After Simmons toured with Joe Elliott in South America, the two talked about their bands working together. From June 23 to August 31, 2014, the bands toured 42 cities, with a dollar per ticket donated to such military charities as Wounded Warrior Project.

For the first time in the band&#x27;s 41-year history, Kiss was featured on the cover of the April 10, 2014 (Issue 1206) edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. On April 10, 2014, Kiss was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Though the rockers did not perform, the original four members showed up at the 29th annual induction ceremony in Brooklyn to accept the honor. Former guitarist Bruce Kulick revealed that he, Singer, and Thayer were also present at the Hall of Fame induction; the three were invited by Stanley and Simmons even though the Hall of Fame only chose to induct the four founding members. Kulick also claimed that Simmons and Stanley would have wanted to perform despite their ongoing disagreements with founding members Criss and Frehley, but that the Hall of Fame was too stringent in their rules. Kulick&#x27;s own idea for a potential Hall of Fame induction would have been an acoustic set with all seven members present that night (Simmons, Stanley, Criss, Frehley, Kulick himself, Singer, and Thayer) performing. In November 2014 the band played a historic nine-show run at the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino, Las Vegas.
On January 28, 2015, Kiss released a collaboration single with the Japanese female idol group Momoiro Clover Z, titled &quot;Yume no Ukiyo ni Saite Mi na&quot;. It was the first time Kiss had issued a collaboration record with another artist. In Japan, it was released physically in two versions: &quot;Momoiro Clover Z Edition&quot; (on CD and Blu-ray) and &quot;Kiss Edition&quot; (CD only). An alternate mix of the single&#x27;s title song was also included as an opening track on the Japanese-only SHM-CD album &quot;Best of Kiss 40&quot;, released in Japan on the same day.

Before the collaboration, the members of Kiss had watched concert videos of Momoiro Clover Z. Stanley later commented during an interview:

On July 21, 2015, the direct-to-DVD animated crossover film Scooby-Doo! and Kiss: Rock and Roll Mystery was released featuring Stanley, Simmons, Thayer, and Singer as themselves. The soundtrack of the film included a combination of old hits and one new track, &quot;Don&#x27;t Touch My Ascot&quot;.

On September 15, 2015, the RIAA announced that the band had earned more Gold records than any other American band in the association&#x27;s 63-year history, with a total of 30 Gold album awards (including the band&#x27;s four 1978 solo albums). Cary Sherman, the RIAA CEO and chairman, commented:

===2016–2023: continued activities and final tour===
In 2016, Kiss conducted a summer tour, titled the Freedom to Rock Tour, of less frequented cities and smaller venues. The tour ran throughout the summer, with opening acts Caleb Johnson and the Dead Daisies. On December 13, 2016, Kiss performed during the season 11 finale of &quot;The Voice&quot;, accompanied by the season winner Sundance Head.

There had been conflicting stories regarding whether Kiss would record another album. Simmons had said &quot;yes&quot; in interviews, saying that he had songs written and lined up for a new album. Stanley and Thayer disputed this, however, and said that they did not vow to make one and that the band could move forward without new music. However, on March 25, 2021, Stanley stated that he would not rule out the possibility of Kiss producing new music, with both Simmons and Stanley stating in later interviews that the band did not need to record another album.

The band continued to perform shows in North America and Europe on the Kissworld Tour throughout 2017 and 2018.

On September 19, 2018, following a performance on &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, Kiss announced that it would be ending its career with the End of the Road World Tour in 2019. Stanley commented:

In October 2018, the band reunited with Ace Frehley and Bruce Kulick on the Kiss Kruise. It performed &quot;2,000 Man&quot;, &quot;New York Groove&quot;, &quot;Nothin&#x27; to Lose&quot;, and &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot;. This was the first time Frehley and the band had performed together since 2002 for the closing ceremonies of the 2002 Winter Olympics, and Kulick&#x27;s first time performing with the band live since his departure in 1996.

The band&#x27;s final tour began on January 31 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In February 2019, Simmons said the farewell tour would likely gross between $150 million and $200 million, &quot;not counting ancillaries, licensing, merchandise and stuff like that&quot;. During the first leg of the End of the Road World Tour, Kiss was accused by fans of lip syncing and using backing tracks. Three years prior, Simmons had been critical of bands using backing tracks on live shows. Former Skid Row vocalist Sebastian Bach defended Kiss, saying that the band did not lip-sync at the show he attended. Stanley did not confirm nor deny that he lip syncs on stage, saying he is taking care of his voice. Accusations were revived by fans following the band&#x27;s Belgium performance when there was a slip-up with the fireworks and drum cues on the opening song. Doc McGhee, the band&#x27;s manager, later confirmed that Stanley did sing fully, confirming simultaneously that Stanley will sing to tracks, but denied that he was lip syncing.
On November 14, 2019, the band announced that its Australia and New Zealand shows on its final tour had been canceled due to Stanley&#x27;s health issues, and stated: &quot;Doctor&#x27;s orders ultimately have taken precedence and finally we now find ourselves with no choice but to surrender&quot;. In December 2019, X Japan&#x27;s Yoshiki joined the band in Tokyo and Osaka on their Japan leg to perform &quot;Beth&quot; on piano and &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot; on drums. They would later collaborate on a televised New Year&#x27;s Eve performance in Japan, performing &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot; under the combined name &quot;YoshiKiss&quot;.

Kiss appeared again as special guests on &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; on February 17, 2020, with a televised performance of &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot;. The band would later dedicate &quot;Do You Love Me&quot; to Kobe Bryant and the 2020 Calabasas helicopter crash victims during the Los Angeles show at the Staples Center on March 4, 2020.

With the events of the COVID-19 pandemic, the band had temporarily ceased its final tour, with Simmons commenting that the tour would continue once scientists had confirmed that it is safe to resume. The 2020 edition of Kiss Kruise had been postponed to October 2021, as a result of the pandemic.

Kiss had announced on November 20, 2020, that they would perform an exclusive New Year&#x27;s Eve 2020 livestream show. The Kiss New Year&#x27;s Eve 2020 Goodbye livestream concert was produced by City Drive Studios and directed by Daniel Catullo. The pay-per-view concert was part of the &quot;Landmarks Live&quot; Series and was filmed with over fifty 4K cameras with 360-degree views on a 250-foot stage at The Royal Beach at Atlantis The Palm, Dubai. The performance broke two Guinness World Records: one for the highest flame projection in a music concert and another for the most flame projections launched simultaneously in a music concert.

On December 2, 2020, Simmons confirmed that the band would continue their final tour in the summer of 2021, in which there are another 150 shows left, as well as rescheduling the Australian leg of the final tour. In a June 2021 interview, Stanley remained optimistic that the band would complete their final tour when playing concerts was safe and discussed the inevitable retirement of Kiss. He also did not rule out the possibility of former members Ace Frehley and Peter Criss making appearances during the final tour, stating that he was &quot;open to the idea&quot;. Simmons later invited Frehley to perform encores with the band for their final tour, but Frehley turned down the invitation, also ruling out the possibility of performing at the band&#x27;s final show and expressing doubt that the band would stop touring.
It was announced on December 15, 2020, that a biographical film of the band was in the works, with hopes to release it on time with the band&#x27;s final concert. The band&#x27;s manager Doc McGhee spoke about the process: &quot;Hopefully in the next week we&#x27;ll have a company behind it, and we&#x27;ll start finishing the script, and hopefully by the time we end we&#x27;ll have a movie finished for July of next year.&quot; Deadline reported that Netflix has nearly finalized a deal to produce the Kiss biopic titled &quot;Shout it Out Loud&quot;, which will be released in 2024. The film will be made with close cooperation from both Simmons and Stanley, and will focus on the formative years of the band. Following the announcement of the biopic, a two-part documentary on the band titled &quot;Biography: Kisstory&quot; was also announced and aired on A&amp;E on both June 27 and 28, 2021, with an exclusive live performance following after its debut at the Tribeca Film Festival on June 11, 2021.

In an interview on October 6, 2021, Stanley confirmed that the final concert for Kiss would happen within the next year and a half, stating: &quot;I believe strongly by the beginning of 2023 we will be finished, it seems only natural for the final show to be in New York. That is where the band started, and that was really the background for the band getting together and writing these songs and played loft parties and played clubs starting with an audience of probably 10 people. It seems we should go full circle.&quot; The band performed on board for the 2022 edition of the Kiss Kruise in October to November 2022, which was their final time performing on the cruise. In addition to adding another 100 cities on tour into 2023, Simmons stated that the band would be retiring out of self-respect and love for the fans and that he would be very emotional during the band&#x27;s final performance which he presumed would take place around 2024, although band manager McGhee insisted that their final show would take place in 2023.

Kiss performed as the headline act for the pre-game entertainment at the 2023 AFL Grand Final in Australia on September 30, 2023, in front of more than 100,000 spectators in the stadium and a television audience of about 1.2 million in Australia alone, not including online streaming figures. A week after the AFL performance, Kiss performed their final Australian show in Sydney.

Despite the tour being their final, both Simmons and Stanley have not ruled out the possibility that Kiss could continue without them or the original members for a &quot;new generation&quot; with a possibility of occasional guest appearances. Simmons had expressed interest in the band performing a concert residency in Las Vegas following the announcement for the band&#x27;s final shows, but Stanley later ruled out that possibility, stating that he &quot;can&#x27;t really see that happening&quot;. Simmons later confirmed on November 14, 2023, that while the tour was the band&#x27;s last, the brand would continue with a cartoon show, further merchandise and Kiss-themed travelling shows with different musicians. He also reiterated that the band had no plans to record another album, citing music streaming and downloads as factors. Kiss performed their final show at Madison Square Garden in New York City on December 2, 2023, which was streamed via Pay-per-view.

=== 2023–present: aftermath and digital avatars ===
At the end of the band&#x27;s final show in New York City, it was announced that the band would live on as digital avatars for fully virtual stage show performances, which was created by Industrial Light and Magic and Pophouse, who had previously created ABBA&#x27;s similar digital presentation, &quot;ABBA Voyage&quot;. While Simmons stated that $200 million was being invested for the avatars, the digital avatar shows are set to start in Las Vegas in 2027, with Thayer stating in a January 2024 interview that it would &quot;take some time to get the imagery&quot; where the band would want it to be, regarding it as the future of entertainment.

Simmons is currently continuing to work with the American rock-inspired restaurant Rock &amp; Brews, and performing with his solo band, in which he played his first post-Kiss show at the opening of a Rock &amp; Brews restaurant in Ridgefield, Washington in April 2024, shortly before performing at Summer Breeze in Brazil that same month. Stanley currently is continuing his painting career and his activities with Soul Station.

Kiss was sold to Pophouse for a reported $300 million, including all of their songs along with their brand and intellectual property in April 2024. While both Simmons and Stanley would remain as key roles for the projects being worked on in relation to the band with Pophouse, Simmons kept his focus on the digital avatars, referring to them as &quot;the future of Kiss&quot;. Stanley had originally stated in a November 2024 interview that he was open to the band performing a one-off show, but later had come to terms that it was not going to happen again.

==Artistry==
===Musical style and influences===
Kiss has typically been classified under the genres of hard rock, heavy metal, shock rock, glam metal, and glam rock. Most of its 1970s albums, particularly the first six released between 1974 and 1977 as well as 1982&#x27;s &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot; and 1984&#x27;s &quot;Animalize&quot;, featured a hard rock or traditional heavy metal style. 1979&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty&quot; and 1980&#x27;s &quot;Unmasked&quot; featured a more disco/pop rock sound, and 1981&#x27;s &quot;Music from &quot;The Elder&quot;&quot; found the band dabbling in progressive rock. In 1983, starting with &quot;Lick It Up&quot; and the removal of its trademark makeup, the band began incorporating glam metal into its sound and visual image. Later, in the early 1990s, its sound grew heavier and abandoned the glam metal sound. In the mid-1990s, the band returned to its original sound.

Its music is described as &quot;a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock, driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, cloying melodies, and sweeping strings. It was a sound that laid the groundwork for both arena rock and the pop-metal that dominated rock in the late 1980s.&quot; The first review of Kiss by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, in 1973, described the band as &quot;an American Black Sabbath&quot;. The same magazine&#x27;s review of &quot;Hotter than Hell&quot; stated that &quot;with twin guitars hammering out catchy mondo-distorto riffs and bass and drums amiably bringing up the rear, Kiss spews forth a deceptively controlled type of thunderous hysteria.&quot; At the same time, Bennington Banner from &quot;Rock Music&quot; magazine said, &quot;With its members&#x27; bizarre, Kabuki-like makeup, studded black leather costumes and arsenal of on-stage firepower – both musical and literal – Kiss represents the most extreme form of hard rock in 1974.&quot;
Kiss was strongly influenced by Alice Cooper and New York Dolls, while Gene Simmons has stated that the band&#x27;s &quot;musical heart and soul lies in England&quot;. The Beatles and the Yardbirds&#x27; trio of rock guitarists Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck were among the British acts he praised, with Simmons stating, &quot;I&#x27;ve ripped off so many English riffs, if the British influence wasn&#x27;t there, we wouldn&#x27;t be here. &#x27;Rock and Roll All Nite&#x27; is a direct bastard child of Slade&#x27;s &#x27;Mama Weer All Crazee Now. In his book, &quot;Kiss and Make-Up&quot;, Simmons wrote of the glam rock group Slade, &quot;... we liked the way they connected with the crowd and the way they wrote anthems ... we wanted that same energy, that same irresistible simplicity&quot;.

===Makeup designs===
The band is famous for its iconic makeup designs, each of which represents a different character or persona. The original four designs consisted of: the &quot;Starchild&quot;, the &quot;Demon&quot;, the &quot;Spaceman&quot;, and the &quot;Catman&quot;. The band formerly included a practice of giving any new members a new persona, such as &quot;the Fox&quot; for Carr and &quot;the Ankh Warrior&quot; for Vincent; this practice was ended after Thayer and Singer took up Frehley&#x27;s &quot;Spaceman&quot; and Criss&#x27;s &quot;Catman&quot; personas respectively. When asked on the matter, Simmons stated &quot;Why wouldn&#x27;t we use the classic makeup? We own it&quot;. Criss relinquished his rights to his makeup when he left the band in 2004, which he later regretted, saying &quot;I&#x27;m pissed at myself that my makeup slipped through my hands&quot;, while Frehley claims he licensed his design to the band and would get it back, a notion which Stanley has called &quot;a fantasy&quot;.

During 1973–74, Stanley occasionally used an alternative makeup design called the &quot;Bandit&quot; for select photo-shoots and live shows after Neil Bogart, head of Casablanca Records, suggested to him that he use a design that was symmetrical like those of the rest of the band. During this time, he was also still using the Starchild makeup—sometimes even using both designs at the same photo-shoots. In 1974, he stopped using the Bandit design permanently. On the cover of the band&#x27;s debut album, Criss used a drastically different variation of his Catman makeup (dubbed the &quot;Pantomime Cat&quot;) after he allowed the makeup artist at the shoot to use their own ideas instead of following the usual design. Carr was originally going to be the &quot;Hawk&quot;, a design which Simmons recalled in his autobiography looked like Big Bird from &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. One photo of Carr wearing this proposed design exists today, and also one of a mannequin Stanley set up wearing the proposed makeup and outfit. Unlike the Bandit and Pantomime Cat, this alternative design was never used in any official capacity. The Hawk design was also considered for Vincent and Singer.
Contrary to a false belief spread among the fan community of the band (&quot;The Ankh Warrior&quot;), the official name for Vincent&#x27;s persona is &quot;The Wiz&quot;, as per his contract, press releases for the &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot; tour, magazine interviews, and Simmons&#x27; autobiography.

St. John and Kulick were members of Kiss only during the non-makeup period. Kulick stated that had he ever worn makeup in the band, he would have liked to have been the &quot;Dog&quot;: &quot;I figure that since there&#x27;s already a cat in the band, I should probably be the dog. I&#x27;d have a big circle around one eye and I&#x27;d look like Petey from the Little Rascals. I&#x27;ve actually seen one or two fan renditions of what that might look like, so yeah, I&#x27;d be the dog.&quot; The four original makeup designs have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, with ownership and licensing rights held by Kiss Catalog, Inc (now owned by Pophouse).
There is debate over whether Kiss copied the Brazilian group Secos &amp; Molhados in adopting their iconic face paint and this has been a topic of discussion among fans and media. Secos &amp; Molhados, formed in 1971, were known for their extravagant costumes and face paint, debuting their self-titled album in August 1973. Kiss, emerging from New York’s glam scene, began performing with their distinctive makeup in early 1973, releasing their debut album in February 1974. While some suggest that Kiss may have been influenced by Secos &amp; Molhados, the timeline indicates that both bands developed their styles independently around the same period. Gene Simmons of Kiss has dismissed claims of copying, comparing them to unfounded legends.

In the broader context of rock history, face paint has been utilized by various artists prior to both bands. Performers like Arthur Brown and Alice Cooper in the 1960s and early 1970s incorporated face paint into their acts, contributing to the theatricality of rock performances.

While both Secos &amp; Molhados and Kiss employed distinctive face paint and theatrical elements in their performances, the evidence suggests that these similarities arose independently, influenced by the broader trends in the rock and glam scenes of the early 1970s.

==Legacy==
The world of concert touring was changed by Kiss&#x27;s practice of erecting uniquely designed stage sets. Tours got larger, carrying more personnel and equipment, including sets, costumes, sound and lighting gear, and pyrotechnics, all requiring more trucking and the total cost increasing by millions of dollars. Kiss also innovated with a significant expansion of concert merchandising, selling non-musical Kiss-branded goods to concertgoers. The sales of merchandise helped pay for the concert expenses and bring a profit to the band as well as give them more of a presence without relying solely on radio. Other bands copied Kiss by selling their own branded goods at concerts, a practice which became more of a necessity in the 1980s with increasing costs of touring. In addition to concert merchandising, Kiss has extended its influence to include a full Kiss-themed mini-golf course at the Rio All-Suite Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada.

<text>Creighton Tull Chaney (February10, 1906 – July12, 1973), known by his stage name Lon Chaney Jr., was an American actor known for playing Larry Talbot in the film &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; (1941) and its various crossovers, Count Alucard (Dracula spelled backward) in &quot;Son of Dracula&quot;, Frankenstein&#x27;s monster in &quot;The Ghost of Frankenstein&quot; (1942), the Mummy in three pictures, and various other roles in many Universal horror films, including six films in their 1940s &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot; series, making him a horror icon. He also portrayed Lennie Small in &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; (1939) and played supporting parts in dozens of mainstream movies, including &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952), &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot; (1958), and numerous Westerns, musicals, comedies and dramas.

Originally referred to in films as Creighton Chaney, he was later credited as &quot;Lon Chaney, Jr.&quot; in 1935, and after &quot;Man Made Monster&quot; (1941), beginning as early as &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; later that same year, he was almost always billed under the name of his more famous father, the deceased cinema giant Lon Chaney, at the studio&#x27;s insistence. Chaney had English, French, and Irish ancestry, and his career in movies and television spanned four decades, from 1931 to 1971.

==Early life==

Creighton Tull Chaney was born on February 10, 1906, in Oklahoma City, the son of then-stage performer Lon Chaney and Frances Cleveland Creighton, a singing stage performer who traveled in road shows across the country with Chaney. In a 1965 interview, Chaney Jr. revealed that he was a stillborn baby. &quot;I was all black and not breathing when I was born,&quot; he shared. &quot;My father ran out of the house with me and broke a hole in the ice in a nearby lake, and dunked me in time after time until he revived me&quot;. His parents&#x27; troubled marriage ended in divorce in 1913 following his mother&#x27;s scandalous public suicide attempt in Los Angeles. Many articles and biographies over the years report that Creighton was led to believe his mother had died while he was a boy, and he only learned that she was still alive after his father&#x27;s death. Creighton always maintained he had a tough childhood.

Young Creighton lived in various homes and boarding schools until 1916, when his father (now employed in the film industry) married Hazel Hastings and could provide a stable home.

From an early age, he worked hard to avoid his famous father&#x27;s shadow. In young adulthood, his father discouraged him from show business, and he attended business college and became successful in a Los Angeles appliance corporation. Creighton, who had begun working for a plumbing company, married Dorothy Hinckley, the daughter of his employer Ralph Hinckley. They had two sons: Lon Ralph Chaney and Ronald Creighton Chaney.

Creighton&#x27;s life changed when his father was diagnosed with throat cancer and died on August 26, 1930, at the age of 47.

==Career==
===As Creighton Chaney===

It was only after his father&#x27;s death that Chaney began to act in films, billed under his own name. He began with an uncredited bit part in the serial &quot;The Galloping Ghost&quot; (1931) and signed a contract with RKO where he was given small roles in a number of films, including &quot;Girl Crazy&quot; (1932), &quot;Bird of Paradise&quot; (1932), and &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot; (1932) (from which Chaney&#x27;s few scenes were edited out before the film was released).

RKO gave him the starring role in a serial, &quot;The Last Frontier&quot; (1932). He got bigger film roles in &quot;Lucky Devils&quot; (1933), &quot;Son of the Border&quot; (1933), &quot;Scarlet River&quot; (1933), and &quot;The Life of Vergie Winters&quot; (1934). Over at Mascot Pictures he supported John Wayne in a serial, &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1933), which was later re-edited into a film entitled &quot;Desert Command&quot; (1946).

&quot;I did every possible bit in pictures&quot; said Chaney later. &quot;Had to do stuntwork to live. I bulldogged steers, fell off and got knocked off cliffs, rode horses off precipices into rivers, drove prairie schooners up and down hills.&quot;

He had the lead in the independent film &quot;Sixteen Fathoms Deep&quot; (1934), and a memorable part in which his character sings in &quot;Girl o&#x27; My Dreams&quot; (1934) at Monogram. The last film he made as Creighton Chaney was &quot;The Marriage Bargain&quot; (1935) for Screencraft Productions. After this point he was billed as Lon Chaney, Jr. until 1942, when he was usually billed, at the insistence of Universal Studios, with his iconic father&#x27;s name, although the &quot;Jr.&quot; was usually added by others to distinguish the two.

===As Lon Chaney Jr.===
He had the lead in &quot;A Scream in the Night&quot; (1934) made for Commodore Pictures, a crime thriller. He played small roles at Paramount: &quot;Hold &#x27;Em Yale&quot; (1935), &quot;Accent on Youth&quot; (1935) and &quot;Rose Bowl&quot; (1936). A small outfit, Ray Kirkwood Productions, gave him a lead, &quot;The Shadow of Silk Lennox&quot; (1935).

At Republic, he featured alongside Gene Autry in &quot;The Singing Cowboy&quot; (1936) and &quot;The Old Corral&quot; (1937). He was a henchman in a serial for Republic, &quot;Undersea Kingdom&quot; (1936). Universal got him to play a henchman in their serial, &quot;Ace Drummond&quot; (1937), and he was uncredited in Columbia&#x27;s &quot;Killer at Large&quot; (1936). He lent his name to a cafe which was embroiled in a liquor scandal.

Chaney Jr. was the main villain in &quot;Cheyenne Rides Again&quot; (1937) and also played a villainous part in a serial, &quot;Secret Agent X-9&quot; (1937).

===20th Century Fox===
Chaney Jr. signed a contract at 20th Century Fox and appeared in &quot;Love Is News&quot; (1937) with Tyrone Power, &quot;Midnight Taxi&quot; (1937) with Brian Donlevy, &quot;That I May Live&quot; (1937), &quot;This Is My Affair&quot; (1937) with Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck, &quot;Angel&#x27;s Holiday&quot; (1937), &quot;Born Reckless&quot; (1937) with Brian Donlevy, &quot;Wild and Woolly&quot; (1937) with Walter Brennan, &quot;The Lady Escapes&quot; (1937) with Gloria Stuart, &quot;Thin Ice&quot; (1937) with Tyrone Power, &quot;One Mile from Heaven&quot; (1937) with Claire Trevor, &quot;Charlie Chan on Broadway&quot; (1938), &quot;Life Begins in College&quot; (1937) with the Ritz Brothers, &quot;Wife, Doctor and Nurse&quot; (1937) with Loretta Young, &quot;Second Honeymoon&quot; (1937) with Tyrone Power and Loretta Young, &quot;Checkers&quot; (1937), &quot;Love and Hisses&quot; (1938) with Walter Winchell, &quot;City Girl&quot; (1938), &quot;Happy Landing&quot; (1938) with Ethel Merman, &quot;Sally, Irene and Mary&quot; (1938) with Fred Allen and Jimmy Durante, &quot;Mr. Moto&#x27;s Gamble&quot; (1938) with Peter Lorre, &quot;Walking Down Broadway&quot; (1938) with Claire Trevor, &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot; (1938) with Tyrone Power, &quot;Josette&quot; (1938) with Don Ameche and Robert Young, &quot;Speed to Burn&quot; (1938) with Lynn Bari, &quot;Passport Husband&quot; (1938), &quot;Straight, Place and Show&quot; (1938) with the Ritz Brothers, John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Submarine Patrol&quot; (1938) with Nancy Kelly, and &quot;Road Demon&quot; (1939). He was almost killed by a train while filming a bank robbery scene in &quot;Jesse James&quot; (1939). &quot;Jesse James&quot; also coincidentally featured Henry Hull, the star of &quot;Werewolf of London&quot; (1935), in a supporting role.

Chaney Jr. later made &quot;Charlie Chan in City in Darkness&quot; (1939) with Lynn Bari and &quot;Frontier Marshal&quot; (1939) with Randolph Scott and Nancy Kelly.

===&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; (1939)===
Chaney Jr&#x27;s only stage appearance had been as Lennie Small in a production of &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; with Wallace Ford. He was cast in that role in the 1939 film adaptation, which was produced by Hal Roach Studios. The film was Chaney Jr&#x27;s first major role in a film and was a critical success for him. Chaney had a screen test for the role of Quasimodo for the remake of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1939), a role which his father played back in 1923, but the role went to Charles Laughton.

===&quot;One Million B.C.&quot;===
Hal Roach used him in his third-billed character role in &quot;One Million B.C.&quot; (1940) as Victor Mature&#x27;s caveman father, after which Chaney began to be viewed as a character actor in the mold of his father. He had in fact designed a swarthy, ape-like Neanderthal make-up on himself for the film, but production decisions and union rules prevented his following through on emulating his father in that fashion. Cecil B. DeMille used him in a supporting role in &quot;North West Mounted Police&quot; (1940) and MGM used him in &quot;Billy the Kid&quot; (1941) with Robert Taylor as Billy and Brian Donlevy as Pat Garrett. That studio considered putting Chaney Jr in a remake of his father&#x27;s hit &quot;He Who Gets Slapped&quot; but decided not to make it.

===Universal Pictures===
Universal Pictures offered Chaney Jr the lead in &quot;Man-Made Monster&quot; (1941), a science-fiction horror thriller originally written with Boris Karloff in mind. Chaney&#x27;s first horror film, it was successful enough for them to offer him a long-term contract.

Universal kept him in supporting roles for a while: a comedy &quot;Too Many Blondes&quot; (1941), a musical &quot;San Antonio Rose&quot; (1941) with Shemp Howard, a serial &quot;Riders of Death Valley&quot; (1941) featuring Noah Beery Jr., the Western &quot;Badlands of Dakota&quot; (1941) and the &quot;Northern&quot; &quot;North to the Klondike&quot; (1942) with Broderick Crawford.

===Horror film star: &quot;The Wolf Man&quot;, &quot;The Mummy&quot;, &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot;===


Chaney Jr. was then given the title role in &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; (1941) for Universal, a role which, much like Karloff&#x27;s Frankenstein monster, would largely typecast Chaney as a horror film actor for the rest of his life. Universal dropped the &quot;Jr.&quot; and billed him as &quot;Lon Chaney&quot; going forward within that studio, apparently to foster confusion with his father among audiences.

Chaney Jr. was now an official horror star, and Universal gave him the role of Frankenstein&#x27;s monster in &quot;The Ghost of Frankenstein&quot; (1942), the first B-movie of the series, when Boris Karloff decided not to play the part again; Bela Lugosi returned in his role as Ygor and the leading lady was Evelyn Ankers. He was in a crime film, &quot;Eyes of the Underworld&quot; (1942), and the wartime shorts &quot;Keeping Fit&quot; (1942) and &quot;What We Are Fighting For&quot; (1943).

Chaney Jr. played Kharis the Mummy in &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Tomb&quot; (1942), another hit. He was in a Western &quot;Frontier Badmen&quot; (1943), then reprised his role as the Wolf Man in &quot;Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man&quot; (1943) with Bela Lugosi as Frankenstein&#x27;s monster. The film was originally filmed with the Monster being blind and speaking in Lugosi&#x27;s distinctive &quot;Ygor&quot; voice, but the studio cut out all references to either so that audiences were left wondering why the Monster staggered around with his arms extended in front of him, not to mention why he had lost the ability to speak since &quot;Ghost of Frankenstein&quot;, grievously damaging Lugosi&#x27;s reputation.

Chaney Jr. was given the role of Dracula in &quot;Son of Dracula&quot; (1943); the film was actually about Dracula himself, who had no son in the film. This made him the only actor to portray all four of Universal&#x27;s major horror characters: the Wolf Man, Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, the Mummy, and Count Dracula.

After a cameo in &quot;Crazy House&quot; (1943) he was given the lead in &quot;Calling Dr. Death&quot; (1943), based on the Inner Sanctum mysteries. It kicked off another series starring Chaney, the next of which was &quot;Weird Woman&quot; (1944).

He made a second mummy movie, &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Ghost&quot; (1944), and had a supporting part in &quot;Cobra Woman&quot; (1944), starring Maria Montez, and &quot;Ghost Catchers&quot; (1944), with the comedy team Olsen and Johnson.

&quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Eyes&quot; (1944) was the third Inner Sanctum, after which he was back as the Wolf Man in &quot;House of Frankenstein&quot; (1944). &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Curse&quot; (1944) was Chaney&#x27;s third and final appearance as Kharis.

He played an antagonist in the Abbott and Costello comedy &quot;Here Come the Co-Eds&quot; (1945), then made more Inner Sanctums: &quot;The Frozen Ghost&quot; (1945) with Evelyn Ankers and &quot;Strange Confession&quot; (1945) with Brenda Joyce. He returned as the Wolf Man in &quot;House of Dracula&quot; (1945), one of the last of the Universal horror cycle. &quot;Pillow of Death&quot; (1945) was the last Inner Sanctum. &quot;The Daltons Ride Again&quot; (1945) was a Western featuring Noah Beery Jr. in a supporting role.

===Leaving Universal===
Despite being typecast as the Wolf Man, the 6-foot 2-inch, 220-pound actor managed to carve out a secondary niche as a supporting actor and villain.

He was in a Bob Hope comedy, &quot;My Favorite Brunette&quot; (1947), supported Randolph Scott in &quot;Albuquerque&quot; (1948) and had a supporting role in &quot;The Counterfeiters&quot; (1948); he played a villain in &quot;16 Fathoms Deep&quot; (1948) for Monogram Pictures, a remake of his 1934 film.

He reprised his Wolf Man role to great effect in &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein&quot; (1948) but it did not cause a notable boost to his career. In April 1948 Chaney was hospitalized after taking an overdose of sleeping pills. He recovered and played Harry Brock in a Los Angeles theatre production of &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; in 1949.

Chaney kept busy in support roles: &quot;Captain China&quot; (1950), &quot;Once a Thief&quot; (1950), &quot;Inside Straight&quot; (1951), &quot;Bride of the Gorilla&quot; (1951), &quot;Only the Valiant&quot; (1951), &quot;Behave Yourself!&quot; (1951), &quot;Flame of Araby&quot; (1952), &quot;The Bushwackers&quot; (1952), &quot;Thief of Damascus&quot; (1952), &quot;Battles of Chief Pontiac&quot; (1952) (in the title role), &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952), &quot;Springfield Rifle&quot; (1952), &quot;The Black Castle&quot; (1952) (a return to horror), &quot;Raiders of the Seven Seas&quot; (1953), &quot;A Lion Is in the Streets&quot; (1953) with James Cagney, &quot;The Boy from Oklahoma&quot; (1954), &quot;Casanova&#x27;s Big Night&quot; (1954), &quot;Passion&quot; (1954), &quot;The Black Pirates&quot; (1954), &quot;Jivaro&quot; (1955), &quot;Big House, U.S.A.&quot; (1955), &quot;I Died a Thousand Times&quot; (1955), &quot;The Indian Fighter&quot; (1955), and &quot;The Black Sleep&quot; (1956)

He had a leading role in &quot;Indestructible Man&quot; (1956) then was back to supporting parts: &quot;Manfish&quot; (1956); a Martin and Lewis comedy, &quot;Pardners&quot; (1956); &quot;Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer&quot; (1957); &quot;The Cyclops&quot; (1957) and &quot;The Alligator People&quot; (1959).

Chaney established himself as a favorite of producer Stanley Kramer; in addition to playing a key supporting role in &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952) (starring Gary Cooper), he also appeared in &quot;Not as a Stranger&quot; (1955)—a hospital melodrama featuring Robert Mitchum and Frank Sinatra—and &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot; (1958, starring Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier). Kramer told the press at the time that whenever a script came in with a role too difficult for most actors in Hollywood, he called Chaney.

He became quite popular with baby boomers after Universal released its back catalog of horror films to television in 1957 (&quot;Shock Theater&quot;) and &quot;Famous Monsters of Filmland&quot; magazine regularly focused on his films.

In 1957, Chaney went to Ontario, Canada, to costar in the first ever American-Canadian television production, as Chingachgook in &quot;Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans&quot;, suggested by James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s stories. The series ended after 39 episodes. Universal released their film biography of his father, &quot;Man of a Thousand Faces&quot; (1957), featuring a semi-fictionalized version of Creighton&#x27;s life story from his birth up until his father&#x27;s death. Roger Smith was cast as Creighton as a young adult.

He appeared in an episode of the western series &quot;Tombstone Territory&quot; titled &quot;The Black Marshal from Deadwood&quot; (1958), and appeared in numerous western series such as &quot;Rawhide&quot;. He also hosted the 13-episode television anthology series &quot;13 Demon Street&quot; in 1959, which was created by Curt Siodmak.

===1960s===
In the 1960s, Chaney specialised in horror films, such as &quot;House of Terror&quot; (1960), &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Messenger&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Haunted Palace&quot; (1963), replacing Boris Karloff in the last of those for Roger Corman.
In January 1962, Chaney appeared in Season 4 episode titled &quot;The Tarnished Badge&quot; of the television show Lawman. Chaney plays Jess Bridges a US Marshal gone bad. His Deputy was at one time Dan Troop (John Russell). Bridges redeems himself at the episode&#x27;s end by saving Deputy Johnny McKay

He was in a Western, &quot;Law of the Lawless&quot; (1963) with Dale Robertson, &quot;Face of the Screaming Werewolf&quot; (1964), &quot;Witchcraft&quot; (1964), and &quot;Stage to Thunder Rock&quot; (1964).

He starred in Jack Hill&#x27;s &quot;Spider Baby&quot;, which was made in 1964 but not released until 1968 and would not attain notoriety until after Chaney&#x27;s death. Then it was back to Westerns – &quot;Young Fury&quot; (1965), &quot;Black Spurs&quot; (1965), &quot;Town Tamer&quot; (1966), &quot;Johnny Reno&quot; (1967), &quot;Apache Uprising&quot; (1967), &quot;Welcome to Hard Times&quot; (1967) and &quot;Buckskin&quot; (1968). There was also horror, such as &quot;Dr. Terror&#x27;s Gallery of Horrors&quot; (1967) and &quot;Hillbillys in a Haunted House&quot; (1967).

His bread-and-butter work during this decade was television – where he made guest appearances on everything from &quot;Wagon Train&quot; to &quot;The Monkees&quot; – and in a string of supporting roles in low-budget Westerns produced by A. C. Lyles for Paramount. In 1962, Chaney gained a chance to briefly play Quasimodo in a simulacrum of his father&#x27;s make-up, as well as return to his roles of the Mummy and the Wolf Man on the television series &quot;Route 66&quot; with friends Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre (Karloff wore a quickie version of the Frankenstein monster make-up toward the end of the episode).

===Final films===

In later years, he suffered from throat cancer and chronic heart disease among other ailments after decades of heavy drinking and smoking. In his final horror film, &quot;Dracula vs. Frankenstein&quot;, directed by Al Adamson, he played Groton, Dr. Frankenstein&#x27;s mute henchman. He filmed his part in the spring of 1969, and shortly thereafter performed his final film role, also for Adamson, in &quot;The Female Bunch&quot;. Both films were released in 1971. Though filmed before &quot;The Female Bunch&quot;, &quot;Dracula vs. Frankenstein&quot; was released some weeks later. Chaney had lines in &quot;The Female Bunch&quot; but his hoarse, raspy voice was virtually unrecognizable. Due to illness he retired from acting to concentrate on a book about the Chaney family legacy, &quot;A Century of Chaneys&quot;, which remains to date unpublished in any form. , his grandson, Ron Chaney Jr., was working on completing this project.

==Personal life==
Chaney was married twice. He had two sons by his first wife, Dorothy, Lon Ralph Chaney (July 3, 1928 – May 5, 1992) and Ronald Creighton Chaney (March 18, 1930 – December 15, 1987). Dorothy divorced him in 1936 for drinking too much and being &quot;sullen&quot;. He married Patsy Beck in 1937.

Chaney was well liked by some co-workers – &quot;sweet&quot; is the adjective that most commonly emerges from those who acted with, and liked him – yet he was capable of intense dislikes. For instance, he and frequent co-star Evelyn Ankers did not get along at all. He was also known to befriend younger actors and stand up for older ones who he felt were belittled by the studios. One example was William Farnum, a major silent star who played a small role in &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Curse&quot;. According to co-star Peter Coe, Chaney demanded that Farnum be given his own chair on the set and be treated with respect, or else he would walk off the picture.

Chaney had run-ins with actor Frank Reicher (whom he nearly strangled on camera in &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Ghost&quot;) and director Robert Siodmak (over whose head Chaney broke a vase). Actor Robert Stack claimed in his 1980 autobiography that Chaney and drinking buddy Broderick Crawford were known as &quot;the monsters&quot; around the Universal Pictures lot because of their drunken behavior that frequently resulted in bloodshed.

===Honors===
In 1999, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.

==Death==
Chaney suffered from a series of illnesses in the year prior to his death. In April 1973, he was released from the hospital after undergoing surgery for cataracts and treatment for beriberi. He also suffered from liver problems and gout. Chaney died on July 12, 1973, in San Clemente, California, at the age of 67. His cause of death was not immediately released to the public. Chaney&#x27;s death certificate listed his cause of death as cardiac failure due to arteriosclerotic heart disease and cardiomyopathy.

He was honored by appearing as the Wolf Man on one of a 1997 series of United States postage stamps depicting movie monsters (his father appeared as the Phantom of the Opera, while Bela Lugosi appeared as Dracula, and Boris Karloff had two stamps as Frankenstein&#x27;s monster and the original Mummy). His grandson Ron Chaney Jr. has appeared frequently as a guest at horror movie conventions.

<text>Gene Simmons (born Chaim Witz; ; born August 25, 1949) also known by his stage persona &quot;The Demon&quot;, is an Israeli-born American musician. He was the bassist and co-lead singer of the hard rock band Kiss, which he co-founded with Paul Stanley, Ace Frehley and Peter Criss in the early 1970s until their retirement in 2023. Simmons was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014 as a member of Kiss.
==Early life and education==
Simmons was born Chaim Witz on August 25, 1949, at Rambam Hospital in Haifa, Israel, to Jewish refugees from Hungary. His mother, Florence &quot;Flora&quot; Klein, later Lubowski (1925–2018) was born in Jánd and survived internment in Nazi concentration camps from November 1944 to her liberation from the Mauthausen camp in Austria on May 5, 1945. She and her brother, Larry Klein, were the only members of the family to survive the Holocaust. Simmons&#x27; father, Ferenc &quot;Feri&quot; Yehiel Witz (1925–2002), was a carpenter whom Klein married in 1946 and the couple moved to Israel the following year. Simmons spent his early childhood in Tirat Carmel and was raised in a practicing Jewish household. He has said that his family was &quot;dirt poor&quot;, scraping by on rationed bread and milk. At the age of seven, he began to pick wild fruit and sell it on roadsides together with a friend.

At age eight, after his parents’ divorce, he and his mother emigrated to the United States, settling in Queens, New York City. His father remained in Israel, where he had another son and three daughters. In the United States, Simmons changed his name to Gene Klein, adopting his mother&#x27;s maiden name. When he was nine, he briefly attended a Jewish religious school, Yeshiva Torah Vodaas, before transferring to a public school. He graduated from Newtown High School. He later attended Sullivan County Community College in New York, and Richmond College in Staten Island, New York where he graduated with a BA in Education in 1970.

Before his musical career began, Klein worked a variety of jobs in the city. A proficient typist, he served as an assistant to an editor of &quot;Vogue&quot;, and spent 6 months as a sixth grade instructor on the Upper West Side.

The Beatles had a significant influence on Simmons. &quot;There is no way I&#x27;d be doing what I do now if it wasn&#x27;t for the Beatles. I was watching &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and I saw them. Those skinny little boys, kind of androgynous, with long hair like girls. It blew me away that these four boys [from] the middle of nowhere could make that music.&quot;

He chose his stage name in tribute to the rockabilly singer Jumpin&#x27; Gene Simmons (in other interviews he claimed his stage name was inspired by actress Jean Simmons and he used the title of her 1946 film Great Expectations for a song on the 1976 album &quot;Destroyer&quot;). He practiced playing his guitar for hours on end.

==Career==
===Kiss===

Simmons became involved with his first band, Lynx, then renamed the Missing Links, when he was 15 in 1964–5. Eventually, he disbanded the band to form the Long Island Sounds, the name being a pun on the Long Island Sound. In this band was also future Wicked Lester guitarist Steve Coronel, and future lawyer/author Alan Stuart Graf who convinced Simmons to buy his first bass as the band needed a bass player. In 1967, after losing Graf the band morphed into The Love Bag. While he played in these bands, he worked at odd jobs on the side to make more money, including trading used comic books.

From 1968 to 1970 Simmons attended Sullivan County Community College in Loch Sheldrake, New York for two years. He joined a new band, Bullfrog Bheer, and the band recorded various home demos including &quot;Leeta&quot;; this was later included on the Kiss box set. The band existed until 1970 with various line-ups.

Simmons, Coronel and Brooke Ostrander who was in their 1969 band Coffee formed the rock band first known as Rainbow and later Wicked Lester in the early 1970 with Stanley Eisen (now known as Paul Stanley) and recorded one album, which was never released in its entirety. Dissatisfied with Wicked Lester&#x27;s sound and look, Simmons and Stanley attempted to fire their band members. Met with resistance, they instead quit Wicked Lester, walking away from their record deal with Epic Records, as they decided to form the &quot;ultimate rock band&quot; in its place. Looking for a drummer, Simmons and Stanley found an ad placed by George Peter John Criscuola (known as Peter Criss), who was playing clubs in Brooklyn at the time; they joined and started out as a trio.

During this time, Criss and Simmons also appeared on an unreleased album by Captain Sanity together with members from Criss&#x27; previous band Chelsea. Paul Frehley (better known as Ace Frehley) responded to an ad they put in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; for a lead guitar player, and soon joined them. Kiss released their self-titled debut album in February 1974. Stanley took on the role of lead performer on stage, while Simmons became the driving force behind what became an extensive Kiss merchandising franchise. The eye section of his &quot;Demon&quot; makeup with Kiss came from the wing design of comic book character Black Bolt.

In 1983, when Kiss&#x27;s fame was waning, the members took off their trademark make-up and enjoyed a resurgence in popularity that continued into the 1990s. At this time, Peter Criss, the original drummer, was voted out of the band, and a replacement was sought to fill his vacancy. The new drummer was Paul Charles Caravello, who went by the stage name of Eric Carr, and played for Kiss from 1980 until his death in 1991. The band hosted its own fan conventions in 1995, and fan feedback about the original Kiss members reunion influenced the highly successful 1996–1997 Alive Worldwide reunion tour. In 1998, the band released &quot;Psycho Circus&quot;. Since then, the original lineup has once again dissolved, with Tommy Thayer replacing Ace Frehley on lead guitar and Eric Singer (who performed with Kiss from 1991 through 1996) replacing Peter Criss on drums.

==Artistry==
=== Technique ===
Simmons plays bass, and lead vocals are split between Simmons and rhythm guitarist Paul Stanley in most Kiss songs. Some notable songs featuring Simmons singing lead include &quot;God of Thunder&quot;, &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot;, &quot;Deuce&quot;, &quot;A World Without Heroes&quot;, &quot;I Love It Loud&quot;, &quot;Calling Dr. Love&quot;, &quot;Unholy&quot;, &quot;You Wanted the Best&quot; (first lead vocals), and &quot;Christine Sixteen&quot;, among others. Simmons possesses a baritone voice.

Simmons has expressed his preference for &quot;memorable simplicity&quot; in music as opposed to technical complexity. &quot;I don&#x27;t consider myself—and was never really interested in being—a bass virtuoso [...] I don&#x27;t like show-offs in music. I&#x27;m much more attracted to things that are memorable. It&#x27;s part of the joy of music for me.&quot; He has also said that while he appreciates the technical skill of jazz musicians, he believes they do not have appeal over a wide audience, saying &quot;You can be a jazz player and be respected by musicians, but the rest of the world doesn&#x27;t care.&quot;

===Stage makeup and persona===
In addition to playing bass, Simmons is known for his long tongue, which he frequently sticks out while performing, and on stage is known for his demonic figure by spitting fire and vomiting stage blood. Some publications reported that his tongue measured up to 7 inches long and he had it insured for $1 million, although Simmons himself has not commented on this.

==Personal life==
Simmons resides in Los Angeles with his wife Shannon Lee Tweed, a Canadian actress and former Playboy Playmate. Although they began dating in 1983, they did not marry until 28 years later. Simmons often joked that he and Tweed were &quot;happily unmarried&quot; for over 20 years. He also often paraphrased Groucho Marx, saying &quot;Marriage is an institution, and I don&#x27;t want to live in an institution&quot;. Simmons and Tweed wed on October 1, 2011, at the Beverly Hills Hotel. They have two children: Nick (born January 22, 1989) and Sophie (born July 7, 1992). He formerly had live-in relationships with Cher and Diana Ross, revealing that he fell in love with Ross while dating Cher. Simmons has boasted many times about having bedded thousands of women. In 2010, he claimed the tally stood at 5,000 and that he has a Polaroid picture of each liaison, including the hotel key where it took place. After their wedding, when Shannon found the key for the lockboxes containing the photos (confirming at least that much of the rumors), after a &quot;loving confrontation&quot; with Gene, she had every single Polaroid burned on national television during the final season of their reality show &quot;Gene Simmons Family Jewels&quot;.

Simmons is multilingual, and is able to speak Hungarian, German, English, Hebrew, and some Japanese.

Simmons believes he is an &quot;outcast&quot; in the rock music community due to his open disdain for drug and alcohol use, and has proudly claimed many times to have never been drunk or high on a substance in his life. He has said the reason for his sober lifestyle was for his mother, who was a Holocaust survivor. He said “I’m my mother’s only child [...] I was concerned I had no right to harm my mother. Life did that enough.” However, he has admitted to once accidentally becoming intoxicated on marijuana after mistakenly eating pot brownies.

Simmons is a science fiction and comic book fan and published several science-fiction fanzines, among them &quot;Id&quot;, &quot;Cosmos&quot; (which eventually merged with &quot;Stilletto&quot; to become &quot;Cosmos-Stilletto&quot; and then &quot;Faun&quot;), &quot;Tinderbox&quot;, &quot;Sci-Fi Showcase&quot;, &quot;Mantis&quot; and &quot;Adventure&quot;. He also contributed to other fanzines, among them &quot;BeABohema&quot; and &quot;Sirruish&quot;. By 1977, however, he would write in a letter of comment to &quot;Janus&quot;, &quot;I haven&#x27;t been active [in fandom] for about five years&quot;.

== Personal views and politics ==
===US electoral politics===
Simmons was a supporter of the foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration. He supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq, writing on his website: &quot;I&#x27;m ashamed to be surrounded by people calling themselves liberal who are, in my opinion, spitting on the graves of brave American soldiers who gave their life to fight a war that wasn&#x27;t theirs... in a country they&#x27;ve never been to... simply to liberate the people therein&quot;. In a follow-up, Simmons explained his position and wrote about his love and support for the United States: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t born here. But I have a love for this country and its people that knows no bounds. I will forever be grateful to America for going into World War II, when it had nothing to gain, in a country that was far away... and rescued my mother from the Nazi German concentration camps. She is alive and I am alive because of America. And, if you have a problem with America, you have a problem with me&quot;.

In 2010, Simmons said he regretted voting for Barack Obama and criticized the 2009 health care reforms. Following Obama&#x27;s 2011 speech on the Middle East in which he called on Israel and the Palestinians to negotiate a settlement &quot;based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps&quot;, Simmons told CNBC that Obama was gravely misguided. &quot;If you have never been to the moon, you can&#x27;t issue policy about the moon. For the president to be sitting in Washington D.C. and saying, &#x27;Go back to your &#x27;67 borders in Israel&#x27; – how about you live there and try to defend an indefensible border – nine miles (14 km) wide?&quot; Simmons also accused the United Nations of being &quot;the most pathetic body on the face of the earth&quot;.

In an April 2012 interview, Simmons endorsed Republican Mitt Romney for President: &quot;America should be in business and it should be run by a businessman.&quot;

In an August 2021 interview, regarding the honesty of Donald Trump and his presidential administration, Simmons said, &quot;[W]e all lie to some extent, but what happened the last four years was beyond anything I ever thought imaginable from people who had lots of power — not just him, but the administration, everybody.&quot;

On November 10, 2021, he stated that people who refused to get the COVID-19 vaccine are &quot;an enemy&quot; and called them &quot;evil&quot;.

===Views on Israel===
In March 2011, Simmons visited his birth country, Israel. He described the trip as a &quot;life changing experience&quot;. He talked about how he still feels that he is an Israeli: &quot;I&#x27;m Israeli. I&#x27;m a stranger in America. I&#x27;m an outsider&quot;. While there, Simmons met his half-brother Kobi, and triplet half-sisters Drora, Sharon and Ogenia. He also visited his estranged father&#x27;s grave. Simmons announced he has plans to take Kiss to Israel, something that happened first in 2015 with a concert in Tel Aviv. He has said that he is an ardent supporter of Israel. At a press conference in Israel, he spoke in both Hebrew and English. During his visit to Israel in 2011, he also stated that the artists refusing to perform in Israel for political reasons are &quot;stupid&quot;.

During the 2006 Lebanon War between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, Simmons sent a televised message of support (in both English and Hebrew) to an Israeli soldier seriously wounded in fighting in Lebanon, calling him his &quot;hero&quot;.

On November 6, 2015, he attended a Friends of the Israel Defense Forces gala in Beverly Hills, which raised more than $31 million.

=== Views on Islam ===
In a 2004 interview in Melbourne, Australia, regarding Islamic extremists, Simmons described Islam as a &quot;vile culture&quot;, saying that Muslim women had to walk behind their husbands and were not allowed to be educated or to own houses. He said: &quot;They want to come and live right where you live and they think that you&#x27;re evil.&quot; Muslim media personality Susan Carland argued that Simmons&#x27;s stereotyping of Muslims was inaccurate. Simmons later clarified his comments on his website, saying he had been talking specifically about Muslim extremists.

== Controversies==
===NPR interview===

During an interview on the National Public Radio (NPR) program &quot;Fresh Air&quot; on February 2, 2002, Simmons told Terry Gross: &quot;If you want to welcome me with open arms, I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;re also going to have to welcome me with open legs&quot;, paraphrasing a lyric from the Who&#x27;s 1981 song &quot;You Better You Bet&quot;. Gross replied: &quot;That&#x27;s a really obnoxious thing to say&quot;. At the time, Simmons refused to grant permission to NPR to make the interview available online. However, it appears in print in Gross&#x27; book &quot;All I Did Was Ask&quot; and unauthorized transcripts are available. NPR re-broadcast part of the interview in August 2007. In a 2014 interview with &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, Simmons noted he was upset over what he perceived as Gross&#x27;s &quot;holier-than-thou&quot; attitude, which included mislabeling his band Kiss as &quot;the Kiss&quot;.

===File-sharing controversy===
In 2007, Simmons openly spoke out against music piracy, and called for file-sharers to be sued. A year later, he threatened further lawsuits, and to withhold new recordings, if file-sharing continued. In 2010, Anonymous staged a DDoS on his website, prompting Simmons to hit back with provocative comments once he was back online, at which point Anonymous staged a second DDoS, taking Simmons&#x27;s site down again.

In September 2014, Simmons said &quot;The death of rock was not a natural death. Rock did not die of old age. It was murdered&quot;. Simmons blames file sharing and that no one values music &quot;enough to pay you for it&quot; for the decline of the rock music scene.

===Comments on suicide and depression===
In July 2014, Simmons made comments in an interview with Songfacts that encouraged those with depression to kill themselves.I never understand, because I always call them on their bluff. I&#x27;m the guy who says &#x27;Jump!&#x27; when there&#x27;s a guy on top of a building who says, &quot;That&#x27;s it, I can&#x27;t take it anymore, I&#x27;m going to jump.&quot; Are you kidding? Why are you announcing it? Shut the fuck up, have some dignity and jump! You&#x27;ve got the crowd.The comments drew criticism from Nikki Sixx of Mötley Crüe, who had suffered from depression in the past. Following his comments, both Triple M and Winnipeg radio station Power 97 stated that they were pulling all Kiss songs from their lineup in protest. Simmons later clarified his comments and apologized for the incident.

===&quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; incident===
On November 16, 2017, Simmons made an appearance on &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; to promote a new book, but shortly afterward, he burst into a staff meeting uninvited, unbuttoning his shirt and telling jokes. The next day, on November 17, Fox News announced that Simmons was banned for life from their program, as well as from entering any of the company&#x27;s properties. Simmons later issued a statement saying that he has &quot;a tremendous amount of respect&quot; for the company&#x27;s workers and apologized for &quot;unintentionally offending&quot; any staff members during his visit.

===Sexual assault allegations===

In 2018, Simmons settled a sexual assault lawsuit with an unnamed radio personality, who accused him of touching her inappropriately. The woman claimed that Simmons touched her and &quot;turned standard interview questions into sexual innuendos.&quot; Despite the settlement, Simmons denied the allegations.

In 2019, Ace Frehley, who played together with Simmons for years in Kiss, stated that Simmons had groped his wife, calling Simmons an &quot;asshole and a sex addict&quot;.

== Philanthropy ==
Simmons is a known advocate for ChildFund International&#x27;s work. He traveled to Zambia during his &quot;Gene Simmons Family Jewels&quot; show to visit several of his sponsored children, of whom he has more than 140. Simmons said that the trip &quot;[was] a stark reminder that life doesn&#x27;t treat everyone the same&quot;.

Simmons&#x27;s family received the MEND Humanitarian Award for their philanthropic efforts and support for Mending Kids International at the organization&#x27;s annual gala on November 9, 2013. The award was presented by Mel Gibson. In his acceptance speech, Simmons spoke of his own difficult childhood in Israel in a bullet-riddled house. He recalled his mother&#x27;s excitement when they received a CARE box one day.

Simmons helped found &quot;The Children Matter&quot;, which is a collaborative initiative with the charity MATTER that fights to give children around the world access to health care.

He is an advocate for public safety during the coronavirus pandemic, encouraging people to wear face masks and follow social distance protocols.

==Awards and recognition==

On January 28, 2011, Simmons was in Dallas, Texas, to host the Aces &amp; Angels Salute to the Troops charity event. Simmons was presented the key to the city, and a street (Gene Simmons Boulevard) was named for him.

We are happy to include the Axe bass as it relates to the impact Mr. Simmons and his band Kiss have had on American culture, especially in the creation of a unique and iconic brand that has been embraced by fans worldwide ... The story of Mr. Simmons&#x27; American experience deserves to be preserved. An immigrant and son of a holocaust survivor, he used creative vision and entrepreneurial acumen to make a significant impact for our nation&#x27;s popular culture, becoming an iconic figure in American music and entertainment.&quot;

Simmons is an honorary board member of Little Kids Rock, a national nonprofit that works to restore and revitalize music education in disadvantaged U.S. public schools.

He was the writer or co-writer of many of the band&#x27;s most popular songs. Stanley established The Starchild character for his Kiss persona. Stanley was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014 as a member of Kiss.

In 2006, &quot;Hit Parader&quot; ranked him 18th on their list of the Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time. A Gibson.com readers&#x27; poll in 2010 named him 13th on their list of Top 25 Frontmen.

==Early life==
Stanley Bert Eisen was raised in upper Manhattan, New York City, 211th Street and Broadway. Both of his parents were Jewish. He was the younger of two children; his sister Julia is two years older. Their mother Eva Jontof-Hutter came from a family that fled Nazi Germany for Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and then to New York City. His father William Eisen&#x27;s parents Rebecca and Harry Eisenhandler were from Poland. Stanley was raised Jewish, although he did not consider his family very observant and did not celebrate his bar mitzvah. His parents listened to classical music and light opera; Stanley was greatly moved by Beethoven&#x27;s works.

Since Stanley&#x27;s right ear was misshapen from a birth defect called microtia and he was unable to hear on that side, he found it difficult to determine the direction of a sound, and was unable to understand speech in a noisy environment. Attending PS 98, he was taunted by other children for his deformed ear.

Despite his hearing problem, Stanley enjoyed listening to music, and he watched &quot;American Bandstand&quot; on television. His favorite musical artists included Eddie Cochran, Dion and the Belmonts, Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard. Stanley learned to sing harmony with his family, and he was given a child&#x27;s guitar at age seven.

Stanley&#x27;s family relocated to the Kew Gardens neighborhood in Queens in 1960. He listened to a lot of doo-wop music, but when the Beatles and the Rolling Stones played on U.S. television he was inspired by the performance aspect, which he thought was not out of his reach. Stanley received his first real guitar at age 13, an acoustic one that he would have preferred to be electric. He played tunes by Bob Dylan, the Byrds, the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful and more.

All through his childhood Stanley had been recognized for his talent in graphic arts, so he attended the High School of Music &amp; Art in New York City, graduating in 1970.

==Kiss==
Before Kiss, Stanley was in a local band, Rainbow, and was a member of Uncle Joe and Post War Baby Boom. Through a mutual friend of Gene Simmons, Stanley joined Simmons&#x27; band Wicked Lester in the early 1970s. The band recorded an album in 1972, but it was never officially released. Wicked Lester fell apart and Stanley and Simmons answered Peter Criss&#x27;s advertisement in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Soon after recruiting Criss, they held auditions for a lead guitarist, with Stanley placing an ad in the &quot;Village Voice&quot;. Ace Frehley won the group over with his playing, and was nearly a perfect fit to the group&#x27;s sound. Kiss released their self-titled debut album in February 1974.

At this point, Stanley had the idea of changing his name not only for marketing purposes but also the fact he had always hated his birth name. Inspired by Paul McCartney and Paul Rodgers, he legally changed his name to Paul Stanley.

Stanley&#x27;s persona in Kiss was &quot;the Starchild&quot; displaying one star over his right eye. For a brief time, Stanley tried out a new character &quot;the Bandit&quot;, with a &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; style mask design make-up pattern. This make-up design was used during a few 1973–74 shows and photo-shoots, some of which he was photographed with both designs in the same session. &quot;I even tried painting my face all red,&quot; he admitted. &quot;I looked like a longhaired tomato! Before settling on the star, I&#x27;d just paint a black ring around my eye… Each of us wears something that reflects who we are. I always loved stars and always identified with them – so, when it came time to put something on my face, I knew it would be a star.&quot;
In his book &quot;Sex Money Kiss&quot;, Gene Simmons says Stanley was the driving force for KISS during the period in the 1980s when the band performed without makeup. Those years, Stanley noted, &quot;were fine for me. I found them very satisfying because I got a chance to be out there without makeup, which I craved at that point. I think it was easier for me &quot;[than Simmons]&quot; because my persona was one that wasn&#x27;t really defined by the makeup… The makeup was just reinforcing what you were seeing and who I was.&quot;

In 2007, Stanley was hospitalized with tachycardia. In his absence, Kiss performed live as a trio for the first time in decades. The concert was the first Kiss performance Stanley missed.

During the first leg of the band&#x27;s final tour, Stanley was accused by fans of lip syncing and using backing tracks. In response to the allegations, Stanley did not confirm nor deny that he lip syncs on stage, saying he is taking care of his voice. Accusations were later revived by fans following the band&#x27;s performance in Belgium on June 6, 2022, when a slip-up occurred with the fireworks and drum cues a measure late on the opening song, &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;. Doc McGhee, the band&#x27;s manager, later confirmed simultaneously that Stanley did sing fully, but will sing to tracks, denying that he was lip syncing.

==Solo career==
Stanley released his first solo album &quot;Paul Stanley&quot; as part of the four simultaneously released Kiss solo albums, but he has rarely recorded or performed outside of Kiss. He wrote and recorded material for another album in 1987–88, but it was shelved in favor of the Kiss compilation &quot;Smashes, Thrashes &amp; Hits&quot;. While never officially released, songs such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go&quot; and &quot;When Two Hearts Collide&quot; have circulated as bootleg recordings. One song from the project, &quot;Time Traveler&quot;, was released as part of Kiss&#x27; 2001 box set.

In 1989, Stanley embarked on a brief club tour. His touring band included guitarist Bob Kulick and future Kiss drummer Eric Singer. In the same year, Stanley shared lead vocals with Desmond Child on the title track for the soundtrack of the Wes Craven horror film &quot;Shocker&quot;.

Twenty-eight years after releasing his first solo album, Stanley released a second album, &quot;Live to Win&quot;, on October 24, 2006. Its title song &quot;Live to Win&quot; appears in the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Make Love, Not Warcraft&quot;. In October and November 2006, Stanley embarked on a theater tour in support of &quot;Live to Win&quot;. His touring band was the house band from the CBS TV show &quot;Rock Star&quot;, composed of Paul Mirkovich (keyboards), Jim McGorman (guitar), Rafael Moreira (lead guitar), Nate Morton (drums), and Sasha Krivtsov (bass). In April 2007, Stanley extended the tour to include Australia, playing in Coolangatta, Wollongong, Newcastle, Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide. Portions of the tour were filmed for a documentary titled &quot;Paul Stanley: Live to Dream&quot; by the Chicago-based Film Foetus. The band&#x27;s performance at the House of Blues in Chicago was captured on film and released in 2008 on DVD and digital audio download formats as &quot;One Live Kiss&quot;.

In 2008, Stanley sang a duet with Sarah Brightman, &quot;I Will Be with You&quot;, on her &quot;Symphony&quot; album. In 2016, he guested in Ace Frehley&#x27;s covers album &quot;Origins, Vol. 1&quot;, singing &quot;Fire and Water&quot; by Free.

In 2015, Stanley established Paul Stanley&#x27;s Soul Station, a tribute band playing a mix of soul oldies from the 1960s and 1970s with original songs in the same style. Paul Stanley&#x27;s Soul Station released its first album in 2021, along with its lead single, the original &quot;I, Oh I.&quot;

==Vocals and playing style==
Possessing a tenor vocal range, Stanley tends to sing in the high registers and is known for his falsetto. Stanley uses Ibanez guitars (with various signature models currently available), Seymour Duncan pickups, Ernie Ball strings and ENGL amplifiers, as well as custom made KISS signature picks. He has also used various other makes of guitar over the years, including Washburn (with whom he also had a signature model), Gibson, B.C. Rich, Ampeg and Ovation among others. He has also previously used amplifiers by Fender and later Randall.

==Other projects==

In 1999, Stanley starred in a Toronto production of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, in which he played the role of the Phantom. He appeared in the musical from May 25 to August 1, and again that year from September 30 to October 31, 1999, closing the show&#x27;s ten-year run in Toronto. Stanley made his debut as a painter in 2006, exhibiting and selling original works of art. Stanley collaborated with Boston-based power pop group Click Five on their hit single, &quot;Angel To You (Devil To Me)&quot;.

Stanley produced a debut album for the band New England. Their first single from that album in 1978 &quot;Don&#x27;t Ever Wanna Lose Ya&quot; reached the Top 40 in 1979.

In 2012, Stanley partnered with Gene Simmons and three other investors to form the restaurant franchise Rock &amp; Brews.

On August 15, 2013, Stanley, Gene Simmons and manager Doc McGhee became a part of the ownership group that created the L.A. Kiss Arena Football League team, which played their home games at the Honda Center in Anaheim, California. The team folded in 2016.

In April 2014, Stanley published his memoir, &quot;Face the Music: A Life Exposed&quot; (). In the memoir, Stanley, who is Jewish, accused former bandmates Ace Frehley and Peter Criss of antisemitism.

An unreleased song written by Stanley along with Jean Beauvoir, titled &quot;Like a Bee to the Honey&quot;, was recorded and released by the Finnish hard rock band Lordi for their album, &quot;Killection&quot;.

==Personal life==

In 1982, after he turned 30 years old, Stanley had reconstructive surgery for the microtia in his right ear done by Frederic Rueckert, who had been performing the procedure primarily on children. The new ear was formed from cartilage from one of the singer&#x27;s ribs, with skin grafts put over it. Stanley said the surgery had given him &quot;a new lease on life&quot; and was so grateful to Rueckert that he gave the doctor a Rolex watch upon his retirement. Because of this birth defect, Stanley is an ambassador for the charitable organization AboutFace, an organization that provides support and information to people with facial differences. He has appeared at fundraising events and in videos to raise awareness.

In 2001, Stanley&#x27;s first wife, actress Pamela Bowen, filed for divorce after nine years of marriage. They have one son named Evan, born in June 1994. On November 19, 2005, Stanley married longtime girlfriend Erin Sutton at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Pasadena, California. The couple had a son in September 2006, a daughter in January 2009 and a daughter in August 2011. Stanley considers his children Jewish but as Sutton is Catholic they raised them &quot;100 percent Jewish and 100 percent Catholic&quot;.

Stanley has had two hip-replacement surgeries: one after the &quot;Rock the Nation&quot; tour in October 2004, and a second in December 2004 after complications arose from the first surgery. He had announced in 2005 that he will require a third hip surgery in the future. He regards the degeneration of his left hip as partly the product of thousands of shows performed in platform boots since the early 1970s.

In October 2011, Stanley had surgery on his vocal cords. He said, &quot;I hold myself to a higher standard than others do. With that in mind, I wanted to remedy a few minor issues that come with 40 years of preaching rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.&quot;

<text>State of Grace is an American comedy-drama series that ran for two seasons on Fox Family, later ABC Family during 2001 and 2002.

==Plot==
The show is centered on two 12-year-old girls from very different backgrounds, Hannah and Grace, who are best friends. Hannah is from a middle class Jewish family and lives with her parents, her grandmother, and her uncle. Her parents are the owners of a furniture factory in the fictitious town of Ashmore, North Carolina, to where they have recently moved from Chicago. Grace is from a wealthy Catholic family and lives with her mother, a socialite. Typically, they are depicted as more intelligent, thoughtful, funny, and rebellious than other children of their age. Set in 1965, the show was compared by some to another look-back-through-the-years show, &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;. Fred Savage, the star of the hit ABC series, appeared in the series&#x27; final episode.

The theme song is the original version of &quot;Do You Believe in Magic&quot; by The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful. The show was taped at Ren-Mar Studios stage 4.

<doc id="142244" wikidata="Q137881" url="?curid=142244" title="Peter Criss">
<text>George Peter John Criscuola (born December 20, 1945), better known by his stage name Peter Criss, is a retired American musician, best known as a co-founder, original drummer, and an occasional vocalist of the hard rock band Kiss. Criss established the Catman character for his Kiss persona. In 2014, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Kiss.

== Early years ==
Criss was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Loretta and Joseph Criscuola, who raised their five children (of whom Peter was the eldest) as Roman Catholics. Joseph Criscuola&#x27;s family came from Scafati, Salerno, Italy. Criss grew up in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn and was a childhood friend of Jerry Nolan, who would later find success as the drummer of the New York Dolls. He was an avid art student and a swing aficionado. While playing with bandleader Joey Greco, Criss ended up studying under his idol, Gene Krupa, at the Metropole Club in New York.

== Music career ==

=== Chelsea ===
Criss was involved with several bands through the mid- to late 1960s, starting with the Barracudas from 1962 to 1966 and including Chelsea, who had a two-album deal with Decca Records; the group released a self-titled album in 1970. They never recorded a second album, and in August 1971 became Lips (a trio consisting of Criss and his Chelsea bandmates Michael Benvenga and Stan Penridge). By the spring of 1972, Lips was reduced to just the duo of Criss and Penridge.

In 1973, ex-Chelsea members Pete Shepley and Mike Brand recorded an unreleased album which included post-Chelsea Michael Benvenga, and pre-Kiss Peter Criss and Gene Simmons as session musicians. It was titled &quot;Captain Sanity&quot;.

Another early band featuring Criss was The Sounds of Soul, notable for also featuring future New York Dolls drummer Jerry Nolan and The Elegants guitarist Joe Lucenti whom Criss met in his previous band The Barracudas. The core of the band - Criss, Lucenti and keyboardist Peppi Genarelli - played together from 1966 to 1969, in the summer of 1968 as Brotherhood and from late 1968 under the name The Vintage. Criss and Genarelli then continued to the band Nautilus which existed until late 1970. In 1972-73 Criss and Lucenti were playing together again in Infinity.

=== Kiss ===

After the demise of his band Lips, Criss placed an advertisement in the East Coast edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; &quot;Magazine&quot;, which read:

The advertisement was answered by Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons, who were looking for new members for their band. Ace Frehley was added to the lineup in December 1972, and the band was named Kiss later that month. However, Simmons describes first meeting Criss in his book &quot;Kiss And Make-Up&quot; thusly:

Simmons later in the chapter describes going to a small Italian club in Brooklyn to meet the drummer: &quot;The drummer started to sing, and this Wilson Pickett-style voice came out of him. Paul and I said, &#x27;That&#x27;s it, that&#x27;s our drummer.&#x27; His name was Peter Criscuola.&quot;

Kiss released their self-titled debut in February 1974. Throughout the band&#x27;s initial lineup, Paul and Gene would sing the majority of the songs on each studio album, with Peter, and later Ace, contributing vocals for one or two songs. Throughout his Kiss career, in his original tenure and on the Reunion-era album &quot;Psycho Circus&quot;, Criss was the lead singer on several songs which turned out to be radio-hit and/or live favorites, including &quot;Black Diamond&quot;, &quot;Hard Luck Woman&quot;, and &quot;Beth&quot;.

Criss had collaborated on a demo originally titled &quot;Beck&quot;, a song that was eventually reworked to become the ballad &quot;Beth&quot;, a Top 10 hit for Kiss on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, peaking at No. 7 in 1976. The song remains the highest-charting song for Kiss in the United States and it earned them a People&#x27;s Choice Award for &quot;Young People&#x27;s Favorite New Song&quot; in 1977, tied with &quot;Disco Duck&quot;. The song was actually written before Criss had joined Kiss, while he was still a member of Chelsea. Criss came up with the melody for the song while on a train to New York City from New Jersey where the band practiced. He and Penridge wrote the song together. A demo exists of the song from 1971.

=== Departure from Kiss ===
On the 1979 release &quot;Dynasty&quot;, he played only on his own composition, &quot;Dirty Livin&#x27;&quot;, and did not play at all on &quot;Unmasked&quot; (1980) but was seen on the album covers and music videos for songs from those albums. Anton Fig, who also played on Ace Frehley&#x27;s 1978 solo album, was hired as session drummer for &quot;Dynasty&quot; and &quot;Unmasked&quot; but did not tour; Criss performed on the Dynasty tour and Eric Carr on the tour for Unmasked. At the time, the reasons Criss was fired from Kiss were never made public, although it was obvious that his relationship with his bandmates Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley was not good at the time.

Gene Simmons has said Criss was fired; Paul Stanley discussed Criss&#x27;s departure in several interviews, including the commentary on &quot;Kissology 2&quot;. Ace Frehley in his 2011 book, &quot;No Regrets&quot;, and he stated that Criss was fired during a band meeting in which Frehley, Simmons, Stanley and manager Bill Aucoin voted Criss out of the band. A spoken word CD released in 1999 titled &quot;13 Classic Kiss Stories&quot;, features Bill Aucoin (Kiss&#x27;s first manager) where he also discusses Criss being &quot;let go&quot;. Criss, however, has maintained that he quit the band.

The video for &quot;Shandi&quot; (a song Criss did not play on; the only Kiss member featured on the studio recording was Stanley) was shot in one day, and Criss was out of the band at that time; Stanley said of the shoot, &quot;We shot a video for the song &#x27;Shandi&#x27; after the decision to let Peter go had been confirmed. He came to the video shoot knowing it was the last time he would appear with KISS. At the end of the day, he took his makeup case with him and left. It wasn&#x27;t tearful, but it was a big moment. Peter was leaving. We had fired him, and this was the last time we were going to see him in the band&quot;.

Criss officially left Kiss on May 18, 1980. As a result, Kiss postponed the European tour until the end of August, thus giving the band enough time to find a replacement drummer, who they found in Brooklyn-born Eric Carr.

=== Beginning of solo career ===
In March 1980, Criss began recording his second solo album, &quot;Out of Control&quot;. Released later in the year, the album was a commercial failure, despite remaining a favorite with Criss fans. The follow-up album, 1982&#x27;s &quot;Let Me Rock You&quot;, which contained one song written by Gene Simmons, was a similar failure. The album cover featured Criss without his Kiss makeup, but was not released in the U.S. at the time.

For the rest of the 1980s and early 1990s, Criss was involved with a number of bands, each usually lasting less than a year. One of them was The Keep (1988-1990), which featured ex-Kiss guitarist Mark St. John and ex-Black Sabbath and White Tiger frontman David Donato. Criss also played with Los Angeles Balls of Fire from the spring of 1986 to December 1986, with Jane Booke on lead vocals, Bobby Raylove on bass, and JP (John Pakalenka) on guitar, who currently plays for Buckner Funken Jazz in Denver, Colorado. Balls of Fire played only seven shows before Criss left the band (reportedly to enjoy his daughter Jenilee growing up). Another relatively short-lived band was the Criss Penridge Alliance, essentially Peter Criss and Stan Penridge with the 1970s jazz rock fusion band Montage (Mike Hutchens – guitar, Allen Woody – bass (Govt Mule, Allman Brothers Band), John Moss – drums and Tony Crow – keyboards) who rehearsed 39 songs including from the first 3 Peter Criss solo albums, and played around 10 shows in total.

While Kiss was promoting their upcoming release &quot;Crazy Nights&quot;, Criss appeared on the syndicated radio program &quot;Metal Shop&quot; and discussed his time in Kiss from a more positive perspective than before; he promoted the book he was writing at the time, an autobiography to be titled &quot;A Face without a Kiss&quot;. He also mentioned his dream of one day opening his own recording studio and starting a Catman Records label.

In the early 1990s, Criss assembled a band named &quot;Criss&quot;, featuring among others future Queensrÿche guitarist Mike Stone. This band went through frequent line-up changes, toured extensively and released the &quot;Criss&quot; EP in December 1993 and the &quot;Cat #1&quot; album in August 1994.

=== Christopher Dickinson ===
In 1991, a man named Christopher Dickinson began publicly impersonating Peter Criss. Dickinson did an interview as Criss with the tabloid &quot;Star&quot; magazine, in which he claimed that he was now a &quot;homeless alcoholic panhandling for change&quot;. Phil Donahue had both men on his show where the real Criss confronted the impostor.

=== Return to Kiss ===

In 1995, Criss appeared at the official Kiss Konvention in Los Angeles that led to the Kiss live performance that was recorded for &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;. On February 28, 1996, the original members of Kiss made a surprise appearance at the 38th Annual Grammy Awards in full makeup and costumes for the first time together since 1979 to present an award with Tupac Shakur. Subsequently, in April 1996, Kiss held a press conference to announce a reunion tour with all four original members. The 1996–97 Alive/Worldwide Tour was an enormous success, and the reunited Kiss released a studio album, 1998&#x27;s &quot;Psycho Circus&quot;.

Criss played drums on only one track on the album (&quot;Into the Void&quot;, Ace Frehley&#x27;s one lead vocal track), although Criss did have one lead vocal (a track called &quot;I Finally Found My Way&quot;, written by guitarist/vocalist Paul Stanley and Bob Ezrin) and a co-vocal taking turns in the verses with the rest of the band for the song &quot;You Wanted the Best&quot;.

=== Second and third departures ===
Criss left over a contract dispute and was replaced by Eric Singer in 2001. He rejoined the band in late 2002 and appeared on the &quot;Kiss Symphony: Alive IV&quot; DVD and CD before departing from Kiss again in March 2004. The band had opted not to renew his contract following the Rocksimus Maximus Tour. He was once again replaced by Singer, who assumed the &quot;Catman&quot; persona. He said of Kiss performing with replacements for Ace Frehley and himself:

=== After 2004 ===
Since 2004, Criss has kept his public appearances to a minimum. He now resides in Wall Township, New Jersey. He released a solo album, titled &quot;One for All&quot;, in July 2007 on Silvercat Records. Criss performed his last solo show on June 17, 2017, in New York City at the Cutting Room.

== Personal life ==
As of November 2008, Criss has been married three times: Lydia Di Leonardo (1970–79); fashion model Debra Jensen (1979–94); and Gigi Criss (since May 1998). Criss has a daughter, Jenilee, born in 1981.

Criss was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008. While working out, he noticed a lump on his chest that prompted him to visit a doctor. He was successfully treated with a lumpectomy.

Criss released his autobiography, &quot;Makeup to Breakup: My Life In and Out of Kiss&quot;, co-written with author Larry Sloman, in late 2012. In 2017, Criss made the decision to retire from touring at the age of 71.

== Acting roles ==
In addition to playing himself in 1978&#x27;s &quot;Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park&quot; and 1999&#x27;s &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;, Criss has appeared on two television programs in minor roles.

In 2002, he appeared in two episodes of the HBO prison drama &quot;Oz&quot; as inmate Martin Montgomery. He played the role of Mike in the motion picture about the JFK assassination, &quot;Frame of Mind&quot;.

Criss played himself, as well as the cameo role of &quot;Nice Cop&quot;, in &quot;...Thirteen Years Later&quot;, the 1998 third-season Halloween episode of &quot;Millennium&quot;.

<text>Paul Daniel &quot;Ace&quot; Frehley (, ; born April 27, 1951) is an American musician who was the original lead guitarist, occasional lead vocalist and founding member of the rock band Kiss. He invented the persona of The Spaceman (a.k.a. Space Ace) and played with the group from its inception in 1973 until his departure in 1982. After leaving Kiss, Frehley formed his own band named Frehley&#x27;s Comet and released two albums with the group. He subsequently embarked on a solo career, which was put on hold when he rejoined Kiss in 1996 for a highly successful reunion tour.

Frehley&#x27;s second tenure with Kiss lasted until 2002, when he left at the conclusion of what was originally purported to be the band&#x27;s farewell tour. His most recent solo album, &quot;10,000 Volts&quot;, was released on February 23, 2024. &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine ranked him as the 14th Greatest Metal Guitarist of All Time.

Outside Kiss, Frehley achieved further commercial success and popularity, with his debut solo album achieving platinum status. His first album with his Frehley&#x27;s Comet band was also a big success. Frehley is noted for his aggressive, atmospheric and melodic guitar playing and is also known for the use of many &quot;special effects&quot; guitars, including a Gibson Les Paul guitar that emits smoke from the neck humbucker pickup and produces spinning pyrotechnics and a custom Les Paul that emits light based on song tempo. Frehley was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014 as a member of Kiss.

==Early life==
Paul Daniel Frehley was born and raised in The Bronx, New York City, the youngest of three children of Esther Anna (Hecht) and Carl Daniel Friebely Frehley. His father, from Pennsylvania, was the son of Dutch immigrants, and his mother is originally from North Carolina and has a German descent. He has a sister, Nancy, and a brother, Charles, a classical guitarist. The Frehleys were a musical family, and when Frehley received an electric guitar as a Christmas present in 1964, he immersed himself in learning the instrument. &quot;I never went to music school; I never took a guitar lesson, but everybody in my family plays an instrument. My mother and father both played piano, his father was the church organist, and my brother and sister both played piano and acoustic guitar.&quot; Frehley was always surrounded by music, and started playing guitar at age 13. He lists Jimi Hendrix, Albert Lee, Buddy Guy, Jeff Beck, B.B. King, Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones, and the Who as his main influences.

Growing up on the corner of Marion Avenue and 201st Street, off Bedford Park Boulevard (also known as 200th Street) and Webster Avenue in the Bedford Park section of the Bronx, Frehley graduated from Grace Lutheran School at age 13. Two of the high schools he attended were DeWitt Clinton High School on Mosholu Parkway and Theodore Roosevelt High School on Fordham Road. He got the nickname &quot;Ace&quot; in high school from friends who said he was &quot;a real ace&quot; for his ability to get dates. Also in his high school years, a guidance counselor encouraged him to get into graphic arts. He later credited guitar playing for &quot;saving his life&quot; as a member of Kiss.

==Music career==
===Early career===
Frehley&#x27;s earliest bands included The Outrage, The Four Roses, King Kong, Honey (a cover band), and The Magic People. When Frehley&#x27;s later band, Cathedral, began getting paying gigs, he dropped out of high school. At the insistence of his family and girlfriend, Frehley eventually returned and earned a diploma. After graduation, Frehley held a string of short-term jobs, including mail carrier, furniture deliverer, messenger, taxi driver and liquor store delivery person.

===Kiss===
Frehley spent the early 1970s in a series of local bands including one called Molimo who recorded half an album for RCA Records in 1971. In late 1972, his friend, Chris Cassone, spotted an advertisement for a lead guitarist in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; and showed the ad to Frehley. Frehley went to 10 East 23rd Street above the Live Bait Bar and auditioned for Paul Stanley (rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (bass guitar), and Peter Criss (drums). Frehley showed up wearing one red and one orange sneaker and was less than impressive visually, but the band liked what they heard from his playing. About three weeks later the band named Frehley as their lead guitarist. By January 1973 the band came up with the name Kiss. Frehley designed the band&#x27;s double-lightning-bolt logo, which was polished up by Stanley. The band quickly decided to paint their faces for live performances and Frehley decided to start painting silver stars on his eyes. When the group eventually decided to adopt stage personas to match their makeup and costumes, Frehley became &quot;Space Ace&quot;. Later his stage persona was also known as &quot;The Spaceman&quot;. Frehley stated that this persona was inspired by his interest in science fiction and space travel.
While Kiss spent their early days rehearsing and playing in empty clubs, Frehley worked as a part-time cab driver to pay bills. In September 1973, Kiss members began to receive a $50 a week salary from new manager Bill Aucoin, and Frehley quit his cabbie job.

Kiss released their debut album, &quot;Kiss&quot;, in February 1974 – Frehley was credited for writing two songs, &quot;Love Theme from KISS&quot; (the only song co-written by the four original members) and a fan classic, &quot;Cold Gin&quot;. Due to Frehley&#x27;s lack of confidence in his own singing voice, however, Simmons performed the vocals. Frehley wrote or co-wrote several of the band&#x27;s songs over the next few years but did not record vocals on a song until &quot;Shock Me&quot; (inspired by his near-electrocution during a concert in Lakeland, Florida), which appeared on 1977&#x27;s &quot;Love Gun&quot;.

As lead guitarist, Frehley was known for his frenetic, atmospheric playing, becoming one of the most popular guitarists in the 1970s and spawning a generation of new players. Frehley stated in the book &quot;Kiss: Behind the Mask&quot; that many guitarists have told him his playing on 1975&#x27;s hit &quot;Alive!&quot; prompted them to pick up the instrument. Frehley is well recognized for using Gibson Les Paul guitars, including his trademarked model conversion Les Paul Custom (that was designed and implemented by John Elder Robison, known as &quot;Ampie&quot;, an audio engineer working with the band), which filled the stage with smoke during his live guitar solo.
Along with the three other Kiss members, Frehley released an eponymous solo album in 1978. His was the bestselling of the four, and the album&#x27;s lone single—the Russ Ballard-written &quot;New York Groove&quot;, originally recorded by Hello—reached the Top 20 in the United States.

His songwriting presence within the group increased in 1979. He contributed three songs for 1979&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty&quot; and three for 1980&#x27;s &quot;Unmasked&quot;. While this was not the most commercially successful time for Kiss in the United States, the band was beginning to take off in other countries (mostly in Australia, where &quot;Dynasty&quot; and &quot;Unmasked&quot; are their biggest-selling albums). In 1981, a star was named after Frehley in the International Star Registry.

Even as his songwriting role within Kiss was increasing, Frehley found himself increasingly at odds with the musical direction of the band. After Peter Criss was voted out of Kiss in 1980, Frehley was often outvoted 2–1 in band decisions, as replacement drummer Eric Carr was not a partner in Kiss and had no vote. Frehley&#x27;s participation in the recording of 1981&#x27;s &quot;Music from &quot;The Elder&quot;&quot; was far more limited than with previous albums. This was in large part due to his unhappiness with the band&#x27;s decision to create a concept album rather than a straightforward rock album, and, by Frehley&#x27;s own admission, his &quot;not relating all that well&quot; to producer Bob Ezrin, who cut many of Frehley&#x27;s solos from the recorded tracks.

Although Frehley appeared on the covers for the 1982 releases &quot;Killers&quot; and &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot;, he had no involvement with &quot;Killers&quot;, and minimal (no musical) input on &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot;. Frehley&#x27;s last appearances with the band were in the video for &quot;I Love It Loud&quot;, a series of European promotional appearances in November 1982, and a band interview with MTV promoting their world tour.

===Solo career/Frehley&#x27;s Comet===
In December 1982, Kiss began the &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot; tour without Frehley: he was replaced by Vinnie Vincent. Frehley retained a one-quarter share in the Kiss partnership until 1985, however. He received one-quarter of the profits for both &quot;Lick It Up&quot; and &quot;Animalize&quot; although he had no involvement with either record.

In 1984, Frehley started his post-Kiss solo career by assembling a band that included, among others, drummer Anton Fig (who had performed on Frehley&#x27;s 1978 solo album and on two Kiss albums). Bassist John Regan (who had worked with Peter Frampton), whom Frehley met in 1980, was also an original member of the band as was vocalist/guitarist Richie Scarlet and keyboardist Arthur Stead. The group, whose name alternated between &#x27;Ace Frehley&#x27; and Frehley&#x27;s Comet, recorded a series of demos throughout 1984 and 1985. The band performed their first ever live show at S.I.R. Studios in New York City on November 30, 1984, and played a handful of shows in the Northeast United States in March 1985.

After a few unsuccessful attempts at securing a recording contract, the group eventually signed to Megaforce Records and released their first album, &quot;Frehley&#x27;s Comet&quot;, on July 7, 1987. The album was co-produced by Eddie Kramer, who had produced not only a number of Kiss albums, but Frehley&#x27;s 1978 album and some of his 1984–85 demos. Fig, now being the in-studio drummer for David Letterman&#x27;s late-night television show, performed on the album but was unable to maintain a permanent commitment to touring. He played on the 1987 tour in the United States when Frehley&#x27;s band played a double bill with Y&amp;T, and White Lion opening the shows. By the time the band began recording this album, Scarlet had left the group to pursue other projects and was replaced by Tod Howarth. In addition, at some point between the initial Frehley&#x27;s Comet shows in 1984–85 and their signing to Megaforce, the band had become a four-piece, with Stead no longer playing with the group.

&quot;Frehley&#x27;s Comet&quot;, a mixture of hard rock and pop metal, was a successful return to the music scene for Frehley. The album peaked at No. 43 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (selling nearly 500,000 copies), and the single, a Russ Ballard cover &quot;Into the Night&quot;, reached No. 27 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Rock Soldiers&quot; was an autobiographic song, written partially about Frehley&#x27;s April 1982 police chase in White Plains, NY while driving a DeLorean with his friend. The video for &quot;Rock Soldiers&quot; received moderate airplay on MTV, particularly on &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;.

Despite the positive reviews and healthy album sales of &quot;Frehley&#x27;s Comet&quot;, Frehley was unable to maintain much commercial momentum. Two 1988 Frehley&#x27;s Comet albums—the live EP &quot;Live+1&quot; and second studio album &quot;Second Sighting&quot; peaked at No. 84 and No. 81, respectively. A pair of tours in support of Alice Cooper and Iron Maiden ended prematurely, with the band claiming lack of payment in both cases.

In order to reverse his band&#x27;s declining commercial fortunes, Frehley dropped the Frehley&#x27;s Comet moniker and issued 1989&#x27;s &quot;Trouble Walkin&#x27;&quot; under his own name. Tod Howarth and Jamie Oldaker also decided to leave before recording started on the album, and were replaced by Scarlet and Sandy Slavin. Despite the return to a more traditional hard rock style, &quot;Trouble Walkin&quot;&#x27; continued the pattern of declining sales, and peaked at #102. After the tour for Trouble Walkin&#x27; ended prematurely with John Regan resigning after an April 1990 show in Las Vegas, Frehley did not perform live for two years, until July 1992.

One notable aspect of &quot;Trouble Walkin&quot;&#x27; was the guest appearance of Peter Criss, who provided backing vocals on several tracks, along with Sebastian Bach and other members of Skid Row. It was the first time Criss and Frehley had performed together on an album since Kiss&#x27; 1979 album, &quot;Dynasty&quot;, although Criss had shown up briefly at a Frehley&#x27;s Comet show in Los Angeles in 1987, playing drums on a final encore of &quot;Deuce&quot;. Frehley would return the favor by playing solos on Peter Criss&#x27; &quot;Cat #1&quot; album on TNT Records, released in 1994. In contrast to the somewhat adversarial relationship Frehley had with Kiss (particularly Gene Simmons) throughout the 1980s, he and Criss had maintained good ties during the decade. In June 1995, Frehley&#x27;s and Criss&#x27; bands embarked on the &quot;Bad Boys Tour&quot; with Scarlet on guitar, marking the end of Frehley&#x27;s solo band for several years as Kiss shortly thereafter reunited and began touring together again.

===Reunion with Kiss (1996–2002)===
In 1996, Frehley rejoined Kiss for a successful reunion tour, on which all four original members of the band performed live for the first time since original drummer Peter Criss&#x27; departure in 1980. After the tour, they announced that the original lineup would return to the studio to record a new album. The resulting record, &quot;Psycho Circus&quot;, was promoted with a successful world tour, but it was revealed a couple of years later that Frehley&#x27;s and Criss&#x27; involvement on it was minimal. &quot;Into The Void&quot;, which was Frehley&#x27;s lone contribution to the record, including vocals and lead guitar duties, is believed to be the only track that all four original members performed on; Frehley also performed the lead guitar solo on the song &quot;You Wanted The Best&quot;. After completing the &quot;Farewell Tour&quot; with Kiss in late 2001, Frehley left the band and resumed his solo career. After the end of the 2002 Winter Olympics, he performed one last time with Kiss.

&quot;Into the Void&quot; would be the only original song Ace would release between his 1989 album &quot;Trouble Walkin&quot;&#x27; and his 2009 album &quot;Anomaly&quot;.

===Return to Solo Career (2003–present)===
In 2006 Frehley performed Kiss&#x27; &quot;God of Thunder&quot; with Rob Zombie, Slash, Gilby Clarke, Scott Ian, and Tommy Lee at the VH1 Rock Honors in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States on May 25, 2006.

In October 2018, Frehley and Bruce Kulick reunited with Kiss on the Kiss Kruise. The six musicians performed &quot;2,000 Man&quot;, &quot;New York Groove&quot;, &quot;Nothin&#x27; to Lose&quot;, and &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot;. This was the first time Frehley and the band had performed together since 2002 for the closing ceremonies of the 2002 Winter Olympics and Kulick&#x27;s first time performing with the band live since his departure in 1996.

Frehley did not participate in Kiss&#x27; final tour, which began on January 31, 2019, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Stanley and Simmons did not rule out the possibility of Frehley and Peter Criss making appearances during the final tour, with Stanley stating that he was &quot;open to the idea&quot;. Simmons later invited Frehley to perform encores with the band for their final tour, but Frehley turned down the invitation, also ruling out the possibility of performing at the band&#x27;s final show and expressing doubt that the band would stop touring. In June 2022, Simmons reportedly told the Finnish &quot;Chaoszine&quot; that he and Stanley had met with Frehley to try to convince him to make guest appearances with the band but that Frehley was making demands (regarding his makeup and having Thayer not play encores) that couldn&#x27;t be satisfied.

It was announced on December 15, 2020, that a Kiss biopic was in the works, with hopes to release it on time with the band&#x27;s final concert. Deadline reported that Netflix has nearly finalized a deal to produce the Kiss biopic titled &quot;Shout it Out Loud&quot;, which will be released in 2024. The film will be made with close cooperation from both Simmons and Stanley, and will focus on the formative years of the band.

Following the announcement of the biopic, a two-part documentary on the band titled &quot;Biography: Kisstory&quot; was also announced and aired on A&amp;E on both June 27 and 28, 2021, with an exclusive live performance following after its debut at the Tribeca Film Festival on June 11, 2021. Simmons claimed (in June 2022 when being interviewed by &quot;Chaoszine&quot;) that he and Stanley had invited Frehley and Criss to participate in the documentary but that Frehley and Criss told Simmons that &quot;they might do it if they have complete control of the edit. I said, &#x27;We can&#x27;t do that, because even we don&#x27;t have that. But I won&#x27;t control what you say; you can say whatever you want.&#x27; The answer is no — both of them.&quot;

In the June 2022 interview with &quot;Chaoszine&quot;, Simmons also discussed Frehley and Criss&#x27; health and a Kiss fan convention in May 2022, Nashville, Tennessee, called the &quot;Creatures Fest&quot;. Frehley, Criss, Vinnie Vincent, and Bruce Kulick all performed at the event. Criss joined Frehley for part of Frehley&#x27;s set, and both Kulick and Frehley joined Vincent for part of his set. Simmons was asked if he had seen fan footage from the event, to which he responded &quot;Somebody showed me about 30 seconds, yeah. It was very sad. I felt sad for Peter [Criss]…&quot; He further elaborated about Criss&#x27; health, claiming that &quot;When I called to invite Peter to be in the documentary, his health isn&#x27;t what it should be. I don&#x27;t wanna get too specific because it&#x27;s part of his private life. But no, physically, he wouldn&#x27;t be able to do it. Neither would Ace.&quot; With regards to Frehley, Simmons stated that &quot;[he cared] about Ace [Frehley], but he&#x27;s not in shape — he can&#x27;t play that way and doesn&#x27;t have the physical stamina to do that…&quot; and that Frehley and Criss&#x27; actions had resulted in their poor relationship with himself and Stanley.

Shortly before Kiss&#x27; final two shows, and after the end of the tour, Frehley stated that he was not opposed to appearing at the final concerts in New York City. He also stated that he would have accepted such an offer, even if both he and Thayer were wearing his &quot;Spaceman&quot; makeup, for a $250,000 payment for each of the two final shows. Frehley also denied that he and Criss had been invited, claiming that &quot;[Stanley and Simmons] just said that to sell tickets.&quot;

&quot;10,000 Volts&quot; was released in 2024, debuting at #72 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first week sales of 13,000 units. Frehley&#x27;s next album, &quot;Origins Vol. 3&quot;, is tentatively due in 2025.

==Autobiography==
Ace Frehley released his autobiography, &quot;No Regrets – A Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Memoir&quot;, on November 1, 2011. The autobiography was authored by Frehley, Joe Layden and John Ostrosky, and published through Gallery Books, a subdivision of Simon &amp; Schuster. The book entered &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list in the hardcover non-fiction category at #10.

==Technique==
In a 2009 interview with &quot;Rock N Roll Experience Magazine&quot;, Frehley stated, &quot;I&#x27;m an anomaly, I&#x27;m an un-schooled musician, I don&#x27;t know how to read music, but I&#x27;m one of the most famous guitar players in the world, so go figure.&quot;

&quot;I play guitar in such an unorthodox way,&quot; he told &quot;Guitar World&quot; in 1996. &quot;I&#x27;ve never taken a guitar lesson. One of our assistants brought it to my attention a few months ago that, sometimes, when I play chords, my thumb is on the fretted side of the neck. I have no idea why or how I do it, but I do.&quot; Paul Stanley added, &quot;I remember a time early on when Ace and I would play, and I would do vibrato with my hand, and Ace would get vibrato by shaking his whole arm against the neck of the guitar &quot;[laughs]&quot;.&quot;

<text>José Rafael &quot;Piculín&quot; Ortiz Rijos (born October 25, 1963) is a Puerto Rican former professional basketball player. He played in the NCAA, NBA, various European teams, and in Puerto Rico&#x27;s Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN).

While he was in the NBA, he played with the Utah Jazz. He played with the Puerto Rican clubs Atléticos de San Germán, Cangrejeros de Santurce, and Capitanes de Arecibo, while he was in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional. Ortiz was also a member of the senior Puerto Rican national team, from 1983 to 2004. Most notably, he was a member of the 2004 Puerto Rican team that defeated the United States at the 2004 Summer Olympic Games in Athens, Greece. With Puerto Rico, Ortiz played in four different Summer Olympics, as he played at the 1988 Seoul Games, the 1992 Barcelona Games, the 1996 Atlanta Games, and the 2004 Athens Games.

Ortiz holds various honors and records as a basketball player. He ranks fourth and sixth among the all-time statistical leaders for rebounds per game and total rebounds, in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional league. He was also just the third player to have won eight championships in the BSN league. Ortiz was also the first Puerto Rican-born player that was drafted into the NBA. Many basketball experts consider Ortiz to be the best Puerto Rican basketball player of all-time.

Despite his success in sports, Ortiz went through financial troubles, after he retired from playing professional club basketball. In 2011, he was arrested for the possession of 218 marijuana plants. He was sentenced to six months in prison.

On August 30, 2019, Ortiz was inducted into the FIBA Basketball Hall of Fame, in honor of his career with the senior Puerto Rican national basketball team, and his club career, that spanned a period of 26 years.

==Early life and education==
Ortiz was born in Aibonito, Puerto Rico on October 25, 1963, but he was raised in Cayey. He started his basketball career playing as a center, at Benjamin Harrison High School in Cayey. He was nicknamed &quot;Piculín&quot;, after one of the characters in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and &quot;The Concorde&quot;, as a reference to the popular plane and his height (6&#x27;11&quot;). Ortiz earned a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Communications from Oregon State University.

==College career==
Ortiz attended Oregon State University, where he played college basketball with the Oregon State Beavers, from 1985 to 1987, under the team&#x27;s head coach Ralph Miller. At Oregon State, he was a teammate of future Basketball Hall of Fame player Gary Payton, during the latter&#x27;s freshman year. During his two seasons with the Beavers, Ortiz averaged 19.8 points and 8.7 rebounds per game. After the 1986–87 season, he was named the Pac-10 Player of the Year, finishing ahead of (among others) future Basketball Hall of Fame player Reggie Miller of UCLA, in the voting. Ortiz also earned an NCAA DI All-American Honorable Mention, in the 1986–87 season.

==Professional career==
===Puerto Rico===
In 1980, at age 17, Ortiz debuted with the Atléticos de San Germán from the Baloncesto Superior Nacional league in Puerto Rico. As his career progressed, he improved his game significantly, and he led San Germán to a league championship in 1985. That season, Ortiz averaged more than 25 points and 14 rebounds per game. He would lead the team to a second league title in 1991, while he averaged 19 points and 15.8 rebounds per game. After the 1991 season, Ortiz left the Puerto Rican League to play in Europe. He would return to the league in 1994, and lead San Germán to yet another title.

In 1998, Ortiz was released by San Germán. He then went on to play with Cangrejeros de Santurce, and helped them win four titles in a row (1998–2001). In 2002, Ortiz was named the Most Valuable Player of the league, although his team did not reach the league&#x27;s Finals. Ortiz and the Cangrejeros again won another league title, in 2003, making Ortiz only the third player to win eight titles in the league.

Ortiz played with Santurce for two more years, and in 2006, he played with the Capitanes de Arecibo. However, he retired after just one season with the team. He finished his career in the BSN league with 8,915 points, 5,314 rebounds (#6), and 1,134 assists, in 505 regular season games played. To this day, he is considered by many experts to be the best Puerto Rican basketball player.

===NBA===
After graduating from Oregon State University, Ortiz entered the 1987 NBA draft. He was selected in the first round, with the number 15 overall draft pick, by the Utah Jazz. However, before his first NBA season, he received an offer from CAI Zaragoza, of Spain&#x27;s Liga ACB, and he accepted it. Ortiz rejoined the Jazz for the 1988–89 season, and he debuted with the team on November 9, 1988. During his first season, Ortiz played in 51 games, and he was a starter in 15 of those games. He averaged 2.8 points and 1.1 rebounds per game.

Ortiz returned to the NBA for the 1989–90 season, playing in 13 games with the Jazz, before being waived by the team on February 5, 1990. He finished his brief NBA career with an average of 2.9 points and 1.1 rebounds per game. Ortiz wore the number 44 during his NBA career.

===Europe===
Ortiz joined the Spanish ACB League club CAI Zaragoza in 1987. During the 1987–88 ACB season, he was the second leading scorer of the team, with a scoring average of 17.4 points per game. After that season, he returned to the U.S., to play with the Utah Jazz of the NBA.

After being waived by the Jazz in 1990, Ortiz was signed by the Spanish club Real Madrid. While a member of Real Madrid, he played with players such as Fernando Romay, Antonio Martín Espina, and José &quot;Chechu&quot; Biriukov. After that season, he moved to the Spanish club FC Barcelona Banca Catalana, where he won the 1991 edition of the Spanish King&#x27;s Cup. With Barcelona, he also finished in second place in the 1990–91 FIBA European Champions Cup (EuroLeague) season. During the 1991–92 ACB season, he was one of the team&#x27;s leading rebounders.

After that, Ortiz played with the Spanish clubs Festina Andorra (1992–93), Unicaja Polti (1993–94), and the Greek Basket League clubs Gymnastikos S. Larissas (1994–95), Iraklio Crete (1995–96), and Aris Thessaloniki (1996–97). Ortiz helped Aris to win the championship of the 1996–97 FIBA Korać Cup season. After his season with Aris, Ortiz was offered a two-year contract that was worth approximately $1 million in net income per season, by the Greek club PAOK Thessaloniki. However, the contract was declared null and void, when laboratory tests for steroids allegedly came back positive. Ortiz appealed the decision and won, but he refused to return to Europe to play.

===Venezuela===
In 1997, Ortiz played with Guaiqueríes de Margarita, of the Venezuelan League. With his club, he won the league&#x27;s championship, and he was named the MVP of the league&#x27;s finals.

==National team career==
In 1982, Ortiz reached the minimum age to join Puerto Rico&#x27;s national basketball team, and in 1983, he saw his first international competition, at the Pan American Games of Caracas, Venezuela. At the 1987 Pan American Games, Ortiz was the flag-bearer for Puerto Rico. They won the bronze medal at that tournament. Ortiz also helped the Puerto Rican National basketball team earn a gold medal at the 1991 Pan American Games, which were held in Havana, Cuba.

After the 2002 FIBA World Cup, which was held at Indianapolis, Ortiz announced his retirement from the national team, to coincide with national teammate Jerome Mincy&#x27;s retirement from the team. However, Ortiz would later reconsider his decision to retire, and he rejoined the national team. In 2004, he was a part of the Puerto Rican team that defeated the 2004 Team USA at the Athens Summer Olympics.

Overall, Ortiz played with Puerto Rico&#x27;s national team at four FIBA World Cups (1990, 1994, 1998, and 2002), and at four Summer Olympics (1988, 1992, 1996, and 2004).

==Other ventures==
===Entrepreneur===
Ortiz opened a restaurant called &quot;Patria&quot;, in his hometown of Cayey. However, in 2003, the restaurant went bankrupt.

===Politics===
Ortiz became interested in politics, after meeting politician Ferdinand Pérez in 2000. Pérez sought Ortiz&#x27;s advice for legislative measures related to sports. Ortiz eventually accepted to run for Senator, behind Pérez&#x27; campaign for Mayor of San Juan, for the Popular Democratic Party. Ortiz ran for senatorial candidate from the district of San Juan-Guaynabo, in Puerto Rico&#x27;s 2008 general elections. However, both their bids were unsuccessful. Pérez has said that Ortiz distanced from politics after the defeat.

===Social activism===
On May 28, 2011, Ortiz officially opened the Piculín Ortiz Basketball Institute, in Cayey. The former center aimed to develop the basketball skills and performance of local children and teenagers.

==Personal life==
Ortiz married actress Nirita Ruíz, with whom he had one daughter, Volleyball player Neira, and whom he had met during the filming of a commercial for Aqua Velva, in which both acted. He also had a son from a previous relationship. However, the couple divorced in 2006. He has been in a relationship with Sylvia Ríos, since 2009 and married her in 2021.

===Legal problems===
On June 29, 2011, Ortiz was arrested for drug related charges. Federal agents seized 218 marijuana plants in a rented property, along with munitions for AR-15 rifles. Ortiz allegedly claimed possession of all the material during the arrest. At the bail hearing, Ortiz was legally represented by a public defender, since he claimed he had no money for a lawyer. At the hearing, the judge decided to send Ortiz to a rehabilitation clinic.

On November 4, 2011, Ortiz declared himself guilty of the charges against him. The next week, he failed a surprise drug test, which revealed he had used cocaine. Judge Camille Vélez Rivé ordered the immediate imprisonment of Ortiz, arguing that she had given him several opportunities already. On March 29, 2012, he was sentenced to six months in prison.

===Health===
In 2023, Ortiz was diagnosed with colorectal cancer.

On 14 January, 2025, he had surgery to treat his cancer and was released after two weeks in the hospital for the surgery, but was re-hospitalized days after, and the Puerto Rican Basketball Federation announced that blood donations are needed for the former basketball player.

<text>Ramanathan V. Guha (born 1965) is the creator of widely used web standards such as RSS, RDF and Schema.org. He is also responsible for products such as Google Custom Search. He was a co-founder of Epinions and Alpiri. He worked at Google for nearly two decades, most recently as a Google Fellow, before announcing his departure from the company in August 2024.

==Education==
Guha did his schooling from Loyola High School, Pune and graduated with Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Master of Science from University of California, Berkeley and Ph.D from Stanford University.

==Career==
Guha was one of the early co-leaders of the Cyc Project where he worked from 1987 through 1994 at Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation in collaboration with Douglas Lenat. He was responsible for the design and implementation of key parts of the Cyc system, including the CycL knowledge representation language, the upper ontological layers of the Cyc Knowledge Base and some parts of the original Cyc Natural Language understanding system.

Leaving what became Cycorp, Guha founded Q Technology, which created a database schema mapping tool called Babelfish. In 1994, he moved to work at Apple Computer, reporting to Alan Kay, where he developed the Meta Content Framework (MCF) format. In 1997 he joined Netscape where, in collaboration with Tim Bray, he created a new version of MCF that used the XML language and which became the main technical precursor to W3C&#x27;s Resource Description Framework (RDF) standard.

Guha also contributed to the &quot;smart browsing&quot; features of Netscape 4.5 and was instrumental in Netscape&#x27;s acquisition of NewHoo, which Netscape rebranded the Open Directory Project. He created the first version of RSS as part of a move in which the My.Netscape portal was opened to wider participation in March 1999. In 1999 he left Netscape and in May co-founded Epinions, where he worked until 2000. Guha founded Alpiri in late 2000 which created TAP, a semantic web application and knowledge base. In 2002, he became a researcher at IBM Almaden Research Center.

In 2005 Guha joined Google and became a Google Fellow. While at Google he has been responsible for Google Custom Search and a number of enhancements to Adwords. He is also one of the founders of Schema.org and Datacommons.org. After nearly two decades with the company, he announced his departure in August 2024.

<text>A varistor (a.k.a. voltage-dependent resistor (VDR)) is a surge protecting electronic component with an electrical resistance that varies with the applied voltage. It has a nonlinear, non-ohmic current–voltage characteristic that is similar to that of a diode. Unlike a diode however, it has the same characteristic for both directions of traversing current. Traditionally, varistors were constructed by connecting two rectifiers, such as the copper-oxide or germanium-oxide rectifier in antiparallel configuration. At low voltage the varistor has a high electrical resistance which decreases as the voltage is raised. Modern varistors are primarily based on sintered ceramic metal-oxide materials which exhibit directional behavior only on a microscopic scale. This type is commonly known as the metal-oxide varistor (MOV).

Varistors are used as control or compensation elements in circuits either to provide optimal operating conditions or to protect against excessive transient voltages. When used as protection devices, they shunt the current created by the excessive voltage away from sensitive components when triggered.

The name &quot;varistor&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;varying resistor&quot;. The term is only used for non-ohmic varying resistors. Variable resistors, such as the potentiometer and the rheostat, have ohmic characteristics.

==History==
The development of the varistor, in form of a new type of rectifier based on a cuprous oxide (Cu2O) layer on copper, originated in the work by L.O. Grondahl and P.H. Geiger in 1927.

The copper-oxide varistor exhibited a varying resistance in dependence on the polarity and magnitude of applied voltage. It was constructed from a small copper disk, on one side of which, a layer of cuprous oxide was formed. This arrangement provides low resistance to current flowing from the semiconducting oxide to the copper side, but a high resistance to current in the opposite direction, with the instantaneous resistance varying continuously with the voltage applied.

In the 1930s, small multiple-varistor assemblies of a maximum dimension of less than one inch and apparently indefinite useful lifetime found application in replacing bulky electron tube circuits as modulators and demodulators in carrier current systems for telephonic transmission.

Other applications for varistors in the telephone plant included protection of circuits from voltage spikes and noise, as well as click suppression on receiver (&quot;ear-piece&quot;) elements to protect users&#x27; ears from popping noises when switching circuits. These varistors were constructed by layering an even number of rectifier disks in a stack and connecting the terminal ends and the center in an anti-parallel configuration, as shown in the photo of a Western Electric Type 3B varistor of June 1952 (below).

The Western Electric type 500 telephone set of 1949 introduced a dynamic loop equalization circuit using varistors that shunted relatively high levels of loop current on short central office loops to adjust the transmission and receiving signal levels automatically. On long loops, the varistors maintained a relatively high resistance and did not alter the signals significantly.

Another type of varistor was made from silicon carbide (SiC) by R. O. Grisdale in the early 1930s. It was used to guard telephone lines from lightning.

In the early 1970s, Japanese researchers recognized the semiconducting electronic properties of zinc oxide (ZnO) as being useful as a new varistor type in a ceramic sintering process, which exhibited a voltage-current function similar to that of a pair of back-to-back Zener diodes. This type of device became the preferred method for protecting circuits from power surges and other destructive electric disturbances, and became known generally as the metal-oxide varistor (MOV). The randomness of orientation of ZnO grains in the bulk of this material provided the same voltage-current characteristics for both directions of current flow.

== Composition, properties, and operation of the metal-oxide varistor ==

The most common modern type of varistor is the metal-oxide varistor (MOV). This type contains a ceramic mass of zinc oxide (ZnO) grains, in a matrix of other metal oxides, such as small amounts of bismuth, cobalt, manganese oxides, sandwiched between two metal plates, which constitute the electrodes of the device. The boundary between each grain and a neighbor forms a diode junction, which allows current to flow in only one direction. The accumulation of randomly oriented grains is electrically equivalent to a network of back-to-back diode pairs, each pair in parallel with many other pairs.

When a small voltage is applied across the electrodes, only a tiny current flows, caused by reverse leakage through the diode junctions. When a large voltage is applied, the diode junction breaks down due to a combination of thermionic emission and electron tunneling, resulting in a large current flow. The result of this behavior is a nonlinear current-voltage characteristic, in which the MOV has a high resistance at low voltages and a low resistance at high voltages.

=== Electrical characteristics ===
A varistor remains non-conductive as a shunt-mode device during normal operation when the voltage across it remains well below its &quot;clamping voltage&quot;, thus varistors are typically used for suppressing line voltage surges. Varistors can fail for either of two reasons.

A catastrophic failure occurs from not successfully limiting a very large surge from an event like a lightning strike, where the energy involved is many orders of magnitude greater than the varistor can handle. Follow-through current resulting from a strike may melt, burn, or even vaporize the varistor. This thermal runaway is due to a lack of conformity in individual grain-boundary junctions, which leads to the failure of dominant current paths under thermal stress when the energy in a transient pulse (normally measured in joules) is too high (i.e. significantly exceeds the manufacture&#x27;s &quot;Absolute Maximum Ratings&quot;). The probability of catastrophic failure can be reduced by increasing the rating, or using specially selected MOVs in parallel.

Cumulative degradation occurs as more surges happen. For historical reasons, many MOVs have been incorrectly specified allowing frequent swells to also degrade capacity. In this condition the varistor is not visibly damaged and outwardly appears functional (no catastrophic failure), but it no longer offers protection. Eventually, it proceeds into a shorted circuit condition as the energy discharges create a conductive channel through the oxides.

The main parameter affecting varistor life expectancy is its energy (Joule) rating. Increasing the energy rating raises the number of (defined maximum size) transient pulses that it can accommodate exponentially as well as the cumulative sum of energy from clamping lesser pulses. As these pulses occur, the &quot;clamping voltage&quot; it provides during each event decreases, and a varistor is typically deemed to be functionally degraded when its &quot;clamping voltage&quot; has changed by 10%. Manufacturer&#x27;s life-expectancy charts relate current, severity, and number of transients to make failure predictions based on the total energy dissipated over the life of the part.

In consumer electronics, particularly surge protectors, the MOV varistor size employed is small enough that eventually failure is expected. Other applications, such as power transmission, use VDRs of different construction in multiple configurations engineered for long life span.

=== Voltage rating ===

MOVs are specified according to the voltage range that they can tolerate without damage. Other important parameters are the varistor&#x27;s energy rating in joules, operating voltage, response time, maximum current, and breakdown (clamping) voltage. Energy rating is often defined using standardized transients such as 8/20 microseconds or 10/1000 microseconds, where 8 microseconds is the transient&#x27;s front time and 20 microseconds is the time to half value.

=== Capacitance ===
Typical capacitance for consumer-sized (7–20 mm diameter) varistors are in the range of 100–2,500 pF. Smaller, lower-capacitance varistors are available with capacitance of ~1 pF for microelectronic protection, such as in cellular phones. These low-capacitance varistors are, however, unable to withstand large surge currents simply due to their compact PCB-mount size.

=== Response time ===
The response time of the MOV is not standardized. The sub-nanosecond MOV response claim is based on the material&#x27;s intrinsic response time, but will be slowed down by other factors such as the inductance of component leads and the mounting method. That response time is also qualified as insignificant when compared to a transient having an 8 µs rise-time, thereby allowing ample time for the device to slowly turn-on. When subjected to a very fast, &lt;1 ns rise-time transient, response times for the MOV are in the 40–60 ns range.

== Applications ==

A typical surge protector power strip is built using MOVs. Low-cost versions may use only one varistor, from the hot (live, active) to the neutral conductor. A better protector contains at least three varistors; one across each of the three pairs of conductors. Some standards mandate a triple varistor scheme so that catastrophic MOV failure does not create a fire hazard.

== Hazards ==
While a MOV is designed to conduct significant power for very short durations (about 8 to 20 microseconds), such as caused by lightning strikes, it typically does not have the capacity to conduct sustained energy. Under normal utility voltage conditions, this is not a problem. However, certain types of faults on the utility power grid can result in sustained over-voltage conditions. Examples include a loss of a neutral conductor or shorted lines on the high voltage system. Application of sustained over-voltage to a MOV can cause high dissipation, potentially resulting in the MOV device catching fire. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has documented many cases of catastrophic fires that have been caused by MOV devices in surge suppressors, and has issued bulletins on the issue.
A series connected thermal fuse is one solution to catastrophic MOV failure. Varistors with internal thermal protection are also available.

There are several issues to be noted regarding behavior of transient voltage surge suppressors (TVSS) incorporating MOVs under over-voltage conditions. Depending on the level of conducted current, dissipated heat may be insufficient to cause failure, but may degrade the MOV device and reduce its life expectancy. If excessive current is conducted by a MOV, it may fail catastrophically to an open circuit condition, keeping the load connected but now without any surge protection. A user may have no indication that the surge suppressor has failed. 

Under the right conditions of over-voltage and line impedance, it may be possible to cause the MOV to burst into flames, the root cause of many fires which is the main reason for NFPA&#x27;s concern resulting in UL1449 in 1986 and subsequent revisions in 1998 and 2009. Properly designed TVSS devices must not fail catastrophically, instead resulting in the opening of a thermal fuse or something equivalent that only disconnects MOV devices.

== Limitations ==
A MOV inside a transient voltage surge suppressor (TVSS) does not provide complete protection for electrical equipment. In particular, it provides no protection from sustained over-voltages that may result in damage to that equipment as well as to the protector device. Other sustained and harmful over-voltages may be lower and therefore ignored by a MOV device.

A varistor provides no equipment protection from inrush current surges (during equipment startup), from overcurrent (created by a short circuit), or from voltage sags (brownouts); it neither senses nor affects such events. Susceptibility of electronic equipment to these other electric power disturbances is defined by other aspects of the system design, either inside the equipment itself or externally by means such as a UPS, a voltage regulator or a surge protector with built-in overvoltage protection (which typically consists of a voltage-sensing circuit and a relay for disconnecting the AC input when the voltage reaches a danger threshold).

== Comparison to other transient suppressors ==
Another method for suppressing voltage spikes is the transient-voltage-suppression diode (TVS). Although diodes do not have as much capacity to conduct large surges as MOVs, diodes are not degraded by smaller surges and can be implemented with a lower &quot;clamping voltage&quot;. MOVs degrade from repeated exposure to surges and generally have a higher &quot;clamping voltage&quot; so that leakage does not degrade the MOV. Both types are available over a wide range of voltages. MOVs tend to be more suitable for higher voltages, because they can conduct the higher associated energies at less cost.

Another type of transient suppressor is the gas-tube suppressor. This is a type of spark gap that may use air or an inert gas mixture and often, a small amount of radioactive material such as Ni-63, to provide a more consistent breakdown voltage and reduce response time. Unfortunately, these devices may have higher breakdown voltages and longer response times than varistors. However, they can handle significantly higher fault currents and withstand multiple high-voltage hits (for example, from lightning) without significant degradation.

== Multi-layer varistor ==
Multi-layer varistor (MLV) devices provide electrostatic discharge protection to electronic circuits from low to medium energy transients in sensitive equipment operating at 0–120 volts dc. They have peak current ratings from about 20 to 500 amperes, and peak energy ratings from 0.05 to 2.5 joules.

<text>A laser diode (LD, also injection laser diode or ILD or semiconductor laser or diode laser) is a semiconductor device similar to a light-emitting diode in which a diode pumped directly with electrical current can create lasing conditions at the diode&#x27;s junction.

Driven by voltage, the doped p–n-transition allows for recombination of an electron with a hole. Due to the drop of the electron from a higher energy level to a lower one, radiation is generated in the form of an emitted photon. This is spontaneous emission. Stimulated emission can be produced when the process is continued and further generates light with the same phase, coherence, and wavelength.

The choice of the semiconductor material determines the wavelength of the emitted beam, which in today&#x27;s laser diodes range from the infrared (IR) to the ultraviolet (UV) spectra. Laser diodes are the most common type of lasers produced, with a wide range of uses that include fiber-optic communications, barcode readers, laser pointers, CD/DVD/Blu-ray disc reading/recording, laser printing, laser scanning, and light beam illumination. With the use of a phosphor like that found on white LEDs, laser diodes can be used for general illumination.

== Theory ==

A laser diode is electrically a PIN diode. The active region of the laser diode is in the intrinsic (I) region, and the carriers (electrons and holes) are pumped into that region from the N and P regions respectively. While initial diode laser research was conducted on simple P–N diodes, all modern lasers use the double-hetero-structure implementation, where the carriers and the photons are confined in order to maximize their chances for recombination and light generation. Unlike a regular diode, the goal for a laser diode is to recombine all carriers in the I region, and produce light. Thus, laser diodes are fabricated using direct band-gap semiconductors. The laser diode epitaxial structure is grown using one of the crystal growth techniques, usually starting from an N-doped substrate, and growing the I (undoped) active layer, followed by the P-doped cladding, and a contact layer. The active layer most often consists of quantum wells, which provide lower threshold current and higher efficiency.

=== Electrical and optical pumping ===
Laser diodes form a subset of the larger classification of semiconductor &quot;p&quot;–&quot;n&quot; junction diodes. Forward electrical bias across the laser diode causes the two species of charge carrier – holes and electrons – to be &quot;injected&quot; from opposite sides of the PIN junction into the depletion region. Holes are injected from the &quot;p&quot;-doped into the undoped (i) semiconductor, and electrons vice versa. (A depletion region, devoid of any charge carriers, forms as a result of the difference in electrical potential between &quot;n&quot;- and &quot;p&quot;-type semiconductors wherever they are in physical contact.) Due to the use of charge injection in powering most diode lasers, this class of lasers is sometimes termed &quot;injection lasers&quot;, or &quot;injection laser diodes&quot; (ILD). As diode lasers are semiconductor devices, they may also be classified as semiconductor lasers. Either designation distinguishes diode lasers from solid-state lasers.

Another method of powering some diode lasers is the use of optical pumping. Optically pumped semiconductor lasers (OPSL) use a III-V semiconductor chip as the gain medium, and another laser (often another diode laser) as the pump source. OPSLs offer several advantages over ILDs, particularly in wavelength selection and lack of interference from internal electrode structures. A further advantage of OPSLs is invariance of the beam parameters – divergence, shape, and pointing – as pump power (and hence output power) is varied, even over a 10:1 output power ratio.

=== Generation of spontaneous emission ===
When an electron and a hole are present in the same region, they may recombine or &quot;annihilate&quot; producing a spontaneous emission — that is, the electron may re-occupy the energy state of the hole, emitting a photon with energy equal to the difference between the electron&#x27;s original state and hole&#x27;s state. (In a conventional semiconductor junction diode, the energy released from the recombination of electrons and holes is carried away as phonons (lattice vibrations) rather than as photons.) Spontaneous emission below the lasing threshold produces similar properties to an LED. Spontaneous emission is necessary to initiate laser oscillation, but it is one among several sources of inefficiency once the laser is oscillating.

=== Direct and indirect bandgap semiconductors ===
The difference between the photon-emitting semiconductor laser and a conventional phonon-emitting (non-light-emitting) semiconductor junction diode lies in the type of semiconductor used, one whose physical and atomic structure confers the possibility for photon emission. These photon-emitting semiconductors are the so-called &quot;direct bandgap&quot; semiconductors. The properties of silicon and germanium, which are single-element semiconductors, have bandgaps that do not align in the way needed to allow photon emission and are not considered &quot;direct&quot;. Other materials, the so-called compound semiconductors, have virtually identical crystalline structures as silicon or germanium but use alternating arrangements of two different atomic species in a checkerboard-like pattern to break the symmetry. The transition between the materials in the alternating pattern creates the critical direct bandgap property. Gallium arsenide, indium phosphide, gallium antimonide, and gallium nitride are all examples of compound semiconductor materials that can be used to create junction diodes that emit light.


=== Generation of stimulated emission ===
In the absence of stimulated emission (e.g., lasing) conditions, electrons and holes may coexist in proximity to one another, without recombining, for a certain time, termed the &quot;upper-state lifetime&quot; or &quot;recombination time&quot; (about a nanosecond for typical diode laser materials), before they recombine. A nearby photon with energy equal to the recombination energy can cause recombination by stimulated emission. This generates another photon of the same frequency, polarization, and phase, travelling in the same direction as the first photon. This means that stimulated emission will cause gain in an optical wave (of the correct wavelength) in the injection region, and the gain increases as the number of electrons and holes injected across the junction increases. The spontaneous and stimulated-emission processes are vastly more efficient in direct bandgap semiconductors than in indirect bandgap semiconductors; therefore, silicon is not a common material for laser diodes.

=== Optical cavity and laser modes ===
As in other lasers, the gain region is surrounded by an optical cavity to form a laser. In the simplest form of laser diode, an optical waveguide is made on that crystal&#x27;s surface, such that the light is confined to a relatively narrow line. The two ends of the crystal are cleaved to form perfectly smooth, parallel edges, forming a Fabry–Pérot resonator. Photons emitted into a mode of the waveguide will travel along the waveguide and be reflected several times from each end face before they exit. As a light wave passes through the cavity, it is amplified by stimulated emission, but light is also lost due to absorption and by incomplete reflection from the end facets. Finally, if there is more amplification than loss, the diode begins to &quot;lase&quot;.

Some important properties of laser diodes are determined by the geometry of the optical cavity. Generally, the light is contained within a very thin layer, and the structure supports only a single optical mode in the direction perpendicular to the layers. In the transverse direction, if the waveguide is wide compared to the wavelength of the light, then the waveguide can support multiple transverse optical modes, and the laser is known as &quot;multi-mode&quot;. These transversely multi-mode lasers are adequate in cases where one needs a very large amount of power, but not a small diffraction-limited TEM00 beam, such as in printing, activating chemicals, microscopy, or pumping other types of lasers.

In applications where a small, focused beam is needed, the waveguide must be made narrow, on the order of the optical wavelength. This way, only a single transverse mode is supported and one ends up with a diffraction-limited beam. Such single-spatial-mode devices are used for optical storage, laser pointers, and fiber optics. These lasers may still support multiple longitudinal modes, and thus can lase at multiple wavelengths simultaneously. The wavelength emitted is a function of the bandgap of the semiconductor material and the modes of the optical cavity. In general, the maximum gain will occur for photons with energy slightly above the bandgap energy, and the modes nearest the peak of the gain curve will lase most strongly. The width of the gain curve will determine the number of additional &quot;side modes&quot; that may also lase, depending on the operating conditions. Single-spatial-mode lasers that can support multiple longitudinal modes are called Fabry-Pérot (FP) lasers. An FP laser will lase at multiple cavity modes within the gain bandwidth of the lasing medium. The number of lasing modes in an FP laser is usually unstable and can fluctuate due to changes in current or temperature.

Single-spatial-mode diode lasers can be designed so as to operate on a single longitudinal mode. These single-frequency diode lasers exhibit a high degree of stability, and are used in spectroscopy and metrology and as frequency references. Single-frequency diode lasers are classed as either distributed-feedback (DFB) lasers or distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) lasers.

=== Formation of laser beam ===
Due to diffraction, the beam diverges (expands) rapidly after leaving the chip, typically at 30 degrees vertically by 10 degrees laterally. A lens must be used in order to form a collimated beam like that produced by a laser pointer. If a circular beam is required, then cylindrical lenses and other optics are used. For single-spatial-mode lasers, using symmetrical lenses, the collimated beam ends up being elliptical in shape, due to the difference in the vertical and lateral divergences. This is easily observable with a red laser pointer. The long axis of the ellipse is at right-angles to the plane of the chip.

The simple diode described above has been heavily modified in recent years to accommodate modern technology, resulting in a variety of types of laser diodes, as described below.

== History ==

Following theoretical treatments of M.G. Bernard, G. Duraffourg, and William P. Dumke in the early 1960s, coherent light emission from a gallium arsenide (GaAs) semiconductor diode (a laser diode) was demonstrated in 1962 by two US groups led by Robert N. Hall at the General Electric research center and by Marshall Nathan at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center. There has been ongoing debate as to whether IBM or GE invented the first laser diode, which was largely based on theoretical work by William P. Dumke at IBM&#x27;s Kitchawan Lab (currently known as the Thomas J. Watson Research Center) in Yorktown Heights, NY. The priority is given to the General Electric group, who submitted their results earlier; they also went further and made a resonant cavity for their diode. It was initially speculated, by MIT&#x27;s Ben Lax among other leading physicists, that silicon or germanium could be used to create a lasing effect, but theoretical analyses convinced William P. Dumke that these materials would not work. Instead, he suggested gallium arsenide as a good candidate. The first visible-wavelength laser diode was demonstrated by Nick Holonyak, Jr. later in 1962; he used gallium arsenide phosphide.

Other teams at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Texas Instruments, and RCA Laboratories were also involved in, and received credit for, their historic initial demonstrations of efficient light emission and lasing in semiconductor diodes in 1962 and thereafter. GaAs lasers were also produced in early 1963 in the Soviet Union by the team led by Nikolay Basov.

In the early 1960s, liquid-phase epitaxy (LPE) was invented by Herbert Nelson of RCA Laboratories. By layering the highest-quality crystals of varying compositions, it enabled the demonstration of the highest-quality heterojunction semiconductor laser materials for many years. LPE was adopted by all the leading laboratories worldwide and was used for many years. It was finally supplanted in the 1970s by molecular-beam epitaxy and organometallic chemical vapor deposition.

Diode lasers of that era operated with threshold current densities of 1000 A/cm2 at 77 K temperatures. Such performance enabled continuous lasing to be demonstrated in the earliest days. However, when operated at room temperature, about 300 K, threshold current densities were two orders of magnitude greater, or 100,000 A/cm2, in the best devices. The dominant challenge for the remainder of the 1960s was to obtain low threshold current density at 300 K and thereby to demonstrate continuous-wave lasing at room temperature from a diode laser.

The first diode lasers were homojunction diodes. That is, the material (and thus the bandgap) of the waveguide core layer and that of the surrounding clad layers were identical. It was recognized that there was an opportunity, particularly afforded by the use of liquid-phase epitaxy using aluminum gallium arsenide, to introduce heterojunctions. Heterostructures consist of layers of semiconductor crystal having varying bandgap and refractive index. Heterojunctions (formed from heterostructures) had been recognized by Herbert Kroemer, while working at RCA Laboratories in the mid-1950s, as having unique advantages for several types of electronic and optoelectronic devices, including diode lasers. LPE afforded the technology of making heterojunction diode lasers. In 1963, he proposed the double heterostructure laser.

The first heterojunction diode lasers were single-heterojunction lasers. These lasers used aluminum gallium arsenide &quot;p&quot;-type injectors situated over &quot;n&quot;-type gallium arsenide layers grown on the substrate by LPE. An admixture of aluminum replaced gallium in the semiconductor crystal and raised the bandgap of the &quot;p&quot;-type injector over that of the &quot;n&quot;-type layers beneath. It worked; the 300 K threshold currents went down by 10× to 10,000 A/cm2. Unfortunately, this was still not in the needed range, and these single-heterostructure diode lasers did not function in continuous-wave operation at room temperature.

The innovation that met the room temperature challenge was the double-heterostructure laser. The trick was to quickly move the wafer in the LPE apparatus between different &quot;melts&quot; of aluminum gallium arsenide (&quot;p&quot;- and &quot;n&quot;-type) and a third melt of gallium arsenide. It had to be done rapidly since the gallium arsenide core region needed to be significantly under 1 μm in thickness. The first laser diode to achieve &quot;continuous-wave&quot; operation was a double heterostructure demonstrated in 1970 essentially simultaneously by Zhores Alferov and collaborators (including Dmitri Z. Garbuzov) of the Soviet Union, and Morton Panish and Izuo Hayashi working in the United States. However, it is widely accepted that Alferov and team reached the milestone first.

For their accomplishment and that of their co-workers, Alferov and Kroemer shared the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physics.

== Types ==
The simple laser diode structure described above is inefficient. Such devices require so much power that they can only achieve pulsed operation without damage. Although historically important and easy to explain, such devices are not practical.

=== Double heterostructure lasers ===
In these devices, a layer of low-bandgap material is sandwiched between two high-bandgap layers. One commonly-used pair of materials is gallium arsenide (GaAs) with aluminium gallium arsenide (AlxGa(1-x)As). Each of the junctions between different bandgap materials is called a &quot;heterostructure&quot;, hence the name &quot;double heterostructure&quot; (DH) laser. The kind of laser diode described in the first part of the article may be referred to as a &quot;homojunction&quot; laser, for contrast with these more popular devices.

The advantage of a DH laser is that the region where free electrons and holes exist simultaneously—the active region—is confined to the thin middle layer. This means that many more of the electron-hole pairs can contribute to amplification—not so many are left out in the poorly amplifying periphery. In addition, light is reflected within the heterojunction; hence, the light is confined to the region where the amplification takes place.

=== Quantum well lasers ===

If the middle layer is made thin enough, it acts as a quantum well. This means that the vertical variation of the electron&#x27;s wavefunction, and thus a component of its energy, is quantized. The efficiency of a quantum well laser is greater than that of a bulk laser because the density of states function of electrons in the quantum well system has an abrupt edge that concentrates electrons in energy states that contribute to laser action.

Lasers containing more than one quantum well layer are known as &quot;multiple quantum well&quot; lasers. Multiple quantum wells improve the overlap of the gain region with the optical waveguide mode.

Further improvements in laser efficiency have also been demonstrated by reducing the quantum well layer to a quantum wire or to a &quot;sea&quot; of quantum dots.

=== Quantum cascade lasers ===
In a quantum cascade laser, the difference between quantum well energy levels is used for the laser transition instead of the bandgap. This enables laser action at relatively long wavelengths, which can be tuned simply by altering the thickness of the layer. They are heterojunction lasers.

=== Interband cascade lasers ===
An interband cascade laser (ICL) is a type of laser diode that can produce coherent radiation over a large part of the mid-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

=== Separate confinement heterostructure lasers ===
The problem with the simple quantum well diode described above is that the thin layer is simply too small to effectively confine the light. To compensate, another two layers are added on, outside the first three. These layers have a lower refractive index than the center layers, and hence confine the light effectively. Such a design is called a separate confinement heterostructure (SCH) laser diode.

Almost all commercial laser diodes since the 1990s have been SCH quantum well diodes. 

=== Distributed Bragg reflector lasers ===
A distributed Bragg reflector laser (DBR) is a type of single-frequency laser diode. It is characterized by an optical cavity consisting of an electrically or optically pumped gain region between two mirrors to provide feedback. One of the mirrors is a broadband reflector and the other mirror is wavelength selective so that gain is favored on a single longitudinal mode, resulting in lasing at a single resonant frequency. The broadband mirror is usually coated with a low-reflectivity coating to allow emission. The wavelength-selective mirror is a periodically structured diffraction grating with high reflectivity. The diffraction grating is within a non-pumped, or passive, region of the cavity. A DBR laser is a monolithic single-chip device with the grating etched into the semiconductor. DBR lasers can be edge-emitting lasers or VCSELs. Alternative hybrid architectures that share the same topology include extended-cavity diode lasers and volume Bragg grating lasers, but these are not properly called DBR lasers.

=== Distributed-feedback lasers ===
A distributed-feedback laser (DFB) is a type of single-frequency laser diode. DFBs are the most common transmitter type in DWDM systems. To stabilize the lasing wavelength, a diffraction grating is etched close to the &quot;p&quot;–&quot;n&quot; junction of the diode. This grating acts like an optical filter, causing a single wavelength to be fed back to the gain region and lase. Since the grating provides the feedback that is required for lasing, reflection from the facets is not required. Thus, at least one facet of a DFB is anti-reflection coated. The DFB laser has a stable wavelength that is set during manufacturing by the pitch of the grating, and can only be tuned slightly with temperature. DFB lasers are widely used in optical communication applications where a precise and stable wavelength is critical.

The threshold current of this DFB laser, based on its static characteristic, is around 11 mA. The appropriate bias current in a linear regime could be taken in the middle of the static characteristic (50 mA). Several techniques have been proposed in order to enhance the single-mode operation in these kinds of lasers by inserting a one-phase-shift (1PS) or multiple-phase-shift (MPS) in the uniform Bragg grating. However, multiple-phase-shift DFB lasers represent the optimal solution because they have the combination of higher side-mode suppression ratio and reduced spatial hole-burning.

=== Vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser ===

Vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) have the optical cavity axis along the direction of current flow rather than perpendicular to the current flow as in conventional laser diodes. The active region length is very short compared with the lateral dimensions so that the radiation emerges from the surface of the cavity rather than from its edge as shown in the figure. The reflectors at the ends of the cavity are dielectric mirrors made from alternating high- and low-refractive-index quarter-wave-thick multilayer.

Such dielectric mirrors provide a high degree of wavelength-selective reflectance at the required free surface wavelength if the thicknesses of alternating layers and with refractive indices and are such that , which then leads to the constructive interference of all partially reflected waves at the interfaces. But there is a disadvantage: because of the high mirror reflectivities, VCSELs have lower output powers when compared to edge-emitting lasers.

There are several advantages to producing VCSELs when compared with the production process of edge-emitting lasers. Edge-emitters cannot be tested until the end of the production process. If the edge-emitter does not work, whether due to bad contacts or poor material growth quality, then the production time and the processing materials have been wasted.

Additionally, because VCSELs emit the beam perpendicular to the active region of the laser as opposed to parallel as with an edge emitter, tens of thousands of VCSELs can be processed simultaneously on a three-inch gallium arsenide wafer. Furthermore, even though the VCSEL production process is more labor- and material-intensive, the yield can be controlled to a more predictable outcome. However, they normally show a lower power output level.

===Vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting-laser===
Vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting lasers, or VECSELs, are similar to VCSELs. In VCSELs, the mirrors are typically grown epitaxially as part of the diode structure, or grown separately and bonded directly to the semiconductor containing the active region. VECSELs are distinguished by a construction in which one of the two mirrors is external to the diode structure. As a result, the cavity includes a free-space region. A typical distance from the diode to the external mirror would be 1 cm.

One of the most interesting features of any VECSEL is the small thickness of the semiconductor gain region in the direction of propagation, less than 100 nm. In contrast, a conventional in-plane semiconductor laser entails light propagation over distances of from 250 μm upward to 2 mm or longer. The significance of the short propagation distance is that it causes the effect of &quot;antiguiding&quot; nonlinearities in the diode laser gain region to be minimized. The result is a large-cross-section single-mode optical beam that is not attainable from in-plane (&quot;edge-emitting&quot;) diode lasers.

Several workers demonstrated optically pumped VECSELs, and they continue to be developed for many applications, including high-power sources for use in industrial machining (cutting, punching, etc.) because of their unusually high power and efficiency when pumped by multi-mode diode laser bars. However, because of their lack of &quot;p&quot;–&quot;n&quot; junctions, optically pumped VECSELs are not considered &quot;diode lasers&quot;, and are classified as semiconductor lasers.

Electrically pumped VECSELs have also been demonstrated. Applications for electrically pumped VECSELs include projection displays, served by frequency doubling of near-IR VECSEL emitters to produce blue and green light.

=== External-cavity diode lasers ===
External-cavity diode lasers are tunable lasers which use mainly double heterostructures diodes of the AlGaAs type. The first external-cavity diode lasers used intracavity etalons and simple tuning Littrow gratings. Other designs include gratings in grazing-incidence configuration, multiple-prism grating configurations, and piezo-transduced diode laser configuration.

== Reliability ==

Laser diodes have the same reliability and failure issues as light-emitting diodes. In addition, they are subject to &quot;catastrophic optical damage&quot; COD, when operated at higher power.

Many of the advances in reliability of diode lasers in the last 20 years remain proprietary to their developers. &quot;Reverse engineering&quot; is not always able to reveal the differences between more-reliable and less-reliable diode laser products.

Semiconductor lasers can be surface-emitting lasers such as VCSELs, or in-plane edge-emitting lasers. For edge-emitting lasers, the edge facet mirror is often formed by cleaving the semiconductor wafer to form a specularly reflecting plane. This approach is facilitated by the weakness of the [110] crystallographic plane in III-V semiconductor crystals, such as GaAs, InP, GaSb, etc. compared to the other planes.

The atomic states at the cleavage plane are altered compared to their bulk properties within the crystal by the termination of the perfectly periodic lattice at that plane. Surface states at the cleaved plane have energy levels within the otherwise forbidden bandgap of the semiconductor. Thus, when light propagates through the cleavage plane and transits to free space from within the semiconductor crystal a fraction of the light energy is absorbed by the surface states, where it is converted to the heat by phonon-electron interactions. This heats the cleaved mirror. In addition, the mirror may heat simply because the edge of the diode laser—which is electrically pumped—is in less-than-perfect contact with the mount that provides a path for heat removal. 

The heating of the mirror causes the bandgap of the semiconductor to shrink in the warmer areas. The bandgap shrinkage brings more electronic band-to-band transitions into alignment with the photon energy, causing yet more absorption. This is thermal runaway, a form of the positive feedback, and the result can be melting of the facet, known as &quot;catastrophic optical damage&quot; - COD.

In the 1970s, this problem, which is particularly nettlesome for GaAs-based lasers emitting between 0.630 μm and 1 μm (less so for InP-based lasers used for long-haul telecommunications, which emit between 1.3 μm and 2 μm), was identified. 

Michael Ettenberg, a researcher and later Vice President at RCA Laboratories&#x27; David Sarnoff Research Center in Princeton, New Jersey devised a solution. A thin layer of aluminum oxide was deposited on the facet. If the aluminum oxide thickness is chosen correctly, it functions as an anti-reflective coating, reducing reflection at the surface. This alleviated the heating and COD at the facet.

Since then, various other refinements have been employed. One approach is to create a so-called non-absorbing mirror (NAM) such that the final 10 μm or so before the light emits from the cleaved facet are rendered non-absorbing at the wavelength of the interest.

In the very early 1990s, SDL Inc. began supplying high-power diode lasers with good reliability characteristics. CEO Donald Scifres and CTO David Welch presented new reliability performance data at, e.g., SPIE Photonics West conferences of the era. The methods used by SDL to defeat COD were considered to be highly proprietary and were still undisclosed publicly as June of 2006.

In the mid-1990s, IBM Research - Ruschlikon, Switzerland announced that it had devised its so-called &quot;E2 process&quot;, which conferred extraordinary resistance to the COD in GaAs-based lasers. This process also was undisclosed as of June 2006.

Reliability of high-power diode laser pump bars (used to pump solid-state lasers) remains difficult problem in the variety of applications, in spite of these proprietary advances. Indeed, the physics of diode laser failure is still being worked out, and research on this subject remains active, if proprietary.

Extension of the lifetime of laser diodes is critical to their continued adaptation to a wide variety of applications.

== Applications ==
Laser diodes are numerically the most common laser type, with 2004 sales of approximately 733 million units, as compared to 131,000 of other types of lasers.

=== Telecommunications, scanning, and spectrometry ===
Laser diodes are widely used in telecommunications as easily modulated and easily coupled light sources for fiber-optic communication. They are used in various measuring instruments, such as rangefinders. Another common use is in barcode readers. Visible lasers, typically red but later also green, are common as laser pointers. 

Both low- and high-power diodes are used extensively in the printing industry, both as light sources for scanning (input) of images and for very-high-speed and high-resolution printing plate (output) manufacturing. 

Infrared and red laser diodes are common in CD players, CD-ROMs, and DVD technology. Violet lasers are used in HD DVD and Blu-ray technology. Diode lasers have also found many applications in laser absorption spectrometry (LAS) for high-speed, low-cost assessment or monitoring of the concentration of various species in gas phase. 

High-power laser diodes are used in industrial applications such as heat treating, cladding, seam welding, and for pumping other lasers, such as diode-pumped solid-state lasers.

Uses of laser diodes can be categorized in various ways. Most applications could be served by larger solid-state lasers or optical parametric oscillators, but the low cost of mass-produced diode lasers makes them essential for mass-market applications. Diode lasers can be used in a great many fields; since light has many different properties (power, wavelength, spectral and beam quality, polarization, etc.), it is useful to classify applications by these basic properties.

Many applications of diode lasers primarily make use of the &quot;directed energy&quot; property of the optical beam. In this category, one might include

* laser printers
* barcode readers
* image scanning
* illuminators
* designators
* optical data recording
* combustion ignition
* laser surgery - laser used to cut the tissue
* industrial [optical] sorting
* industrial machining
* wireless power transfer, as power beaming
* directed energy weaponry

Some of the above applications are well-established, while others are emerging.

=== Medical uses ===
Laser medicine: medicine and especially dentistry have found many new uses for diode lasers. The shrinking size and cost of the units and their increasing user-friendliness makes them very attractive to clinicians for minor soft-tissue procedures. 

Diode wavelengths range from 810 to 1,100 nm, are poorly absorbed by soft tissue, and are not used for cutting or ablation. Soft tissue is not cut by the laser&#x27;s beam, but is instead cut by contact with a hot charred glass tip. The laser&#x27;s irradiation is highly absorbed at the distal end of the tip and heats it up to 500–900°C. Because the tip is so hot, it can be used to cut soft tissue and can cause hemostasis through cauterization and carbonization. Diode lasers when used on soft tissue can cause extensive collateral thermal damage to surrounding tissue.

As laser beam light is inherently coherent, certain applications use the coherence of laser diodes. These include interferometric distance measurement, holography, coherent communications, and coherent control of chemical reactions.

Laser diodes are used for their narrow spectral properties in the areas of range-finding, telecommunications, infra-red countermeasures, spectroscopic sensing, generation of radio-frequency or terahertz waves, atomic clock state preparation, quantum key cryptography, frequency doubling and conversion, water purification (in the UV), and photodynamic therapy (where a particular wavelength of light would cause a substance such as porphyrin to become chemically active as an anti-cancer agent only where the tissue is illuminated by light).

Laser diodes are used for their ability to generate ultra-short pulses of light by the technique known as &quot;mode-locking&quot;. Areas of use include clock distribution for high-performance integrated circuits, high-peak-power sources for laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy sensing, arbitrary waveform generation for radio-frequency waves, photonic sampling for analog-to-digital conversion, and optical code-division-multiple-access systems for secure communication.

<doc id="142259" wikidata="Q2336124" url="?curid=142259" title="Defamiliarization">
<text>Defamiliarization or ostranenie () is the artistic technique of presenting to audiences common things in an unfamiliar or strange way so they could gain new perspectives and see the world differently. According to the Russian formalists who coined the term, it is the central concept of art and poetry. The concept has influenced 20th-century art and theory, ranging over movements including Dada, postmodernism, epic theatre, science fiction, and philosophy; additionally, it is used as a tactic by recent movements such as culture jamming.

== Coinage ==

The term &quot;defamiliarization&quot; was first coined in 1917 by Russian formalist Viktor Shklovsky in his essay &quot;Art as Device&quot; (alternate translation: &quot;Art as Technique&quot;). Shklovsky invented the term as a means to &quot;distinguish poetic from practical language on the basis of the former&#x27;s perceptibility.&quot; Essentially, he is stating that poetic language is fundamentally different than the language that we use every day because it is more difficult to understand: &quot;Poetic speech is &quot;formed speech&quot;. Prose is ordinary speech – economical, easy, proper, the goddess of prose [&quot;dea prosae&quot;] is a goddess of the accurate, facile type, of the &quot;direct&quot; expression of a child.&quot; This difference is the key to the creation of art and the prevention of &quot;over-automatization,&quot; which causes an individual to &quot;function as though by formula.&quot;

This distinction between artistic language and everyday language, for Shklovsky, applies to all artistic forms:

The purpose of art is to impart the sensation of things as they are perceived and not as they are known. The technique of art is to make objects &#x27;unfamiliar&#x27;, to make forms difficult, to increase the difficulty and length of perception because the process of perception is an aesthetic end in itself and must be prolonged.

Thus, defamiliarization serves as a means to force individuals to recognize artistic language:

In studying poetic speech in its phonetic and lexical structure as well as in its characteristic distribution of words and in the characteristic thought structures compounded from the words, we find everywhere the artistic trademark – that is, we find material obviously created to remove the automatism of perception; the author&#x27;s purpose is to create the vision which results from that deautomatized perception. A work is created &quot;artistically&quot; so that its perception is impeded and the greatest possible effect is produced through the slowness of the perception.

This technique is meant to be especially useful in distinguishing poetry from prose, for, as Aristotle said, &quot;poetic language must appear strange and wonderful.&quot;

As writer Anaïs Nin discussed in her 1968 book &quot;The Novel of the Future&quot;:
It is the function of art to renew our perception. What we are familiar with we cease to see. The writer shakes up the familiar scene, and as if by magic, &quot;we see a new meaning in it&quot;.

According to literary theorist Uri Margolin:
Defamiliarization of that which is or has become familiar or taken for granted, hence automatically perceived, is the basic function of all devices. And with defamiliarization come both the slowing down and the increased difficulty (impeding) of the process of reading and comprehending and an awareness of the artistic procedures (devices) causing them. 
== Usage ==

=== In Romantic poetry ===
The technique appears in English Romantic poetry, particularly in the poetry of Wordsworth, and was defined in the following way by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in his &quot;Biographia Literaria&quot;: &quot;To carry on the feelings of childhood into the powers of manhood; to combine the child&#x27;s sense of wonder and novelty with the appearances which every day for perhaps forty years had rendered familiar ... this is the character and privilege of genius.&quot;

Preceding Coleridge&#x27;s formulation is that of the German Romantic poet and philosopher Novalis: &quot;The art of estranging in a given way, making a subject strange and yet familiar and alluring, that is Romantic poetics.&quot;

=== In Russian literature ===

To illustrate what he means by defamiliarization, Shklovsky uses examples from Tolstoy, whom he cites as using the technique throughout his works: &quot;The narrator of &#x27;Kholstomer,&#x27; for example, is a horse, and it is the horse&#x27;s point of view (rather than a person&#x27;s) that makes the content of the story seem unfamiliar.&quot; As a Russian Formalist, many of Shklovsky&#x27;s examples use Russian authors and Russian dialects: &quot;And currently Maxim Gorky is changing his diction from the old literary language to the new literary colloquialism of Leskov. Ordinary speech and literary language have thereby changed places (see the work of Vyacheslav Ivanov and many others).&quot;

Defamiliarization also includes the use of foreign languages within a work. At the time that Shklovsky was writing, there was a change in the use of language in both literature and everyday spoken Russian. As Shklovsky puts it: &quot;Russian literary language, which was originally foreign to Russia, has so permeated the language of the people that it has blended with their conversation. On the other hand, literature has now begun to show a tendency towards the use of dialects and/or barbarisms.&quot;

Narrative plots can also be defamiliarized. The Russian formalists distinguished between the fabula or basic story stuff of a narrative and the syuzhet or the formation of the story stuff into a concrete plot. For Shklovsky, the syuzhet is the fabula defamiliarized. Shklovsky cites Lawrence Sterne&#x27;s Tristram Shandy as an example of a story that is defamiliarized by unfamiliar plotting. Sterne uses temporal displacements, digressions, and causal disruptions (e.g., placing the effects before their causes) to slow down the reader&#x27;s ability to reassemble the (familiar) story. As a result, the syuzhet &quot;makes strange&quot; the fabula.

== Related concepts ==

=== Différance ===

Shklovsky&#x27;s defamiliarization can also be compared to Jacques Derrida&#x27;s concept of différance:

What Shklovskij wants to show is that the operation of defamiliarization and its consequent perception in the literary system is like the winding of a watch (the introduction of energy into a physical system): both &quot;originate&quot; difference, change, value, motion, presence. Considered against the general and functional background of Derridian différance, what Shklovsky calls &quot;perception&quot; can be considered a matrix for production of difference. 

Since the term différance refers to the dual meanings of the French word difference to mean both &quot;to differ&quot; and &quot;to defer&quot;, defamiliarization draws attention to the use of common language in such a way as to alter one&#x27;s perception of an easily understandable object or concept. The use of defamiliarization both differs and defers, since the use of the technique alters one&#x27;s perception of a concept (to defer), and forces one to think about the concept in different, often more complex, terms (to differ).
Shklovskij&#x27;s formulations negate or cancel out the existence/possibility of a &quot;real&quot; perception: variously, by (1) the familiar Formalist denial of a link between literature and life, connoting their status as non-communicating vessels, (2) always, as if compulsively, referring to a real experience in terms of empty, dead, and automatized repetition and recognition, and (3) implicitly locating real perception at an unspecifiable temporally anterior and spatially other place, at a mythic &quot;first time&quot; of naïve experience, the loss of which to automatization is to be restored by aesthetic perceptual fullness. 
=== The Uncanny ===

The influence of Russian Formalism on twentieth-century art and culture is largely due to the literary technique of defamiliarization or &#x27;making strange&#x27;, and has also been linked to Freud&#x27;s notion of the uncanny. In &quot;Das Unheimliche&quot; (&quot;The Uncanny&quot;), Freud states that &quot;the uncanny is that class of the frightening which leads back to what is known of old and long familiar,&quot; however, this is not a fear of the unknown, but more of a feeling about something being both strange and familiar. The connection between &quot;ostranenie&quot; and the uncanny can be seen where Freud muses on the technique of literary uncanniness: &quot;It is true that the writer creates a kind of uncertainty in us in the beginning by not letting us know, no doubt purposely, whether he is taking us into the real world or into a purely fantastic one of his own creation.&quot; When &quot;the writer pretends to move in the world of common reality,&quot; they can situate supernatural events, such as the animation of inanimate objects, in the quotidian, day-to-day reality of the modern world, defamiliarizing the reader and provoking an uncanny feeling.

=== The Estrangement effect ===

Defamiliarization has been associated with the poet and playwright Bertolt Brecht, whose Verfremdungseffekt (&quot;estrangement effect&quot;) was a potent element of his approach to theatre. In fact, as Willett points out, Verfremdungseffekt is &quot;a translation of the Russian critic Viktor Shklovskij&#x27;s phrase &#x27;Priem Ostranenija&#x27;, or &#x27;device for making strange&#x27;&quot;. Brecht, in turn, has been highly influential for artists and film-makers including Jean-Luc Godard and Yvonne Rainer.

Science fiction critic Simon Spiegel, who defines defamiliarization as &quot;the formal-rhetorical act of making the familiar strange (in Shklovsky&#x27;s sense),&quot; distinguished it from Brecht&#x27;s estrangement effect. To Spiegel, estrangement is the effect on the reader which can be caused by defamiliarization or through deliberate recontextualization of the familiar.

<doc id="142261" wikidata="Q1364998" url="?curid=142261" title="Nippon Cargo Airlines">
<text>, or NCA, is a cargo airline with its head office on the property of Narita International Airport in Narita, Chiba Prefecture, outside Tokyo. It operates scheduled cargo services in Asia and to Europe and North America. Its main base is Narita Airport.

== History ==
Nippon Cargo Airlines was established on September 21, 1978 (its head office was initially a single room inside All Nippon Airways&#x27; space at the Kasumigaseki Building) and started operations in 1985. It was Japan&#x27;s first all-cargo airline. Over time, their network has grown to include many cities on three continents. Initially, NCA was a joint venture of shipping companies headed by Nippon Yusen and All Nippon Airways (ANA). In August 2005, ANA sold its stake to Nippon Yusen.

The airline is owned by Nippon Yusen (100%). In March 2023, ANA announced plans to acquire NCA from Nippon Yusen to enhance ANA&#x27;s freight operations. The deal was delayed due to international regulatory concerns.

In December 2010, NCA was selected to provide ground support services for the Japanese Air Force One aircraft, replacing Japan Airlines which was then in the process of retiring its 747 fleet.

==Corporate affairs==
===Headquarters and major offices===
Nippon Cargo Airlines has its headquarters in the NCA Line Maintenance Hangar (NCAライン整備ハンガー &quot;NCA Rain Seibi Hangā&quot;) at Narita International Airport in Narita, Chiba Prefecture. The hangar is within the engineering and maintenance complex at Narita Airport. The facility has several environmentally friendly aspects, including a light wall, top lighting, naturally balanced wind power vent windows, a garden roof, a solar water heating system, and equipment to use rainwater to wash aircraft fuselages.

In 2007 NCA signed a deal with Nippon Steel Engineering, which historically built hangars for large aircraft, for the construction of a maintenance and engineering hangar at Narita. The building was to have environmentally friendly procedures conducive to maintaining aircraft during the daytime, because NCA has its aircraft maintenance activities scheduled for daytime hours. On April 30, 2009, the construction of the line maintenance hangar was completed. On June 8, 2009, the hangar&#x27;s operations began.

In July 1978, when the company first began, it operated within a single room inside All Nippon Airways&#x27;s space in the Kasumigaseki Building in Kasumigaseki, Chiyoda, Tokyo. In March 1997 NCA moved its headquarters from the Shiroyama JT Mori Building (城山JT森ビル &quot;Shiroyama JT Mori Biru&quot;) to the 10th floor of the New Kasumigaseki Building (新霞が関ビル &quot;Shin Kasumigaseki Biru&quot;), which had housed NCA&#x27;s marketing division from 1987 to 1991. In March 2003, due to a demand for more space, the headquarters moved to the Shiodome City Center in Shiodome, Minato, Tokyo when it opened; the move was the fifth time the headquarters moved. The airline had its headquarters and its East Japan sales office on the 8th floor.

====Regional office facilities====
Currently the airline&#x27;s corporate Tokyo office is in the Onarimon Yusen Building (御成門郵船ビルディング &quot;Onarimon Yūsen Biru&quot;) in Nishi-Shimbashi, Minato, Tokyo. In 2008 the corporate Narita office was on the fourth floor of the Cargo Administration Building (貨物管理ビル &quot;Kamotsu Kanri Biru&quot;).

====Other Japan facilities====
NCA opened a computer center in Koto, Tokyo in 2007, with the opening ceremony taking place on March 12, 2007. Previously the computer operations were done at the ANA computer center. On October 9, 2007, the airline established its Global Operations Center at Terminal 2 of Narita International Airport. Some members of the technical section of the flight operations headquarters were immediately moved to the new center. In the northern hemisphere spring of 2008, crew-related sections were to be transferred to the new operations center. In 2007 NCA signed an order with Taisei Corporation for the construction of a crew training center. Construction on the crew center, located in Shibayama, Sanbu District, was to begin in September 2007. The company scheduled for the facility to become operational in September 2008. On May 6, 2011, the airline announced that it was relocating its local Narita offices and its cargo warehouse from Narita&#x27;s north cargo area to Narita&#x27;s south cargo area.

===Divisions and worldwide offices===
In 2007, NCA established the regional subsidiaries NCA Americas Inc. and Nippon Cargo Airlines Europe B.V. Its Americas regional headquarters is on the property of O&#x27;Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois. Originally the US subsidiary was to be headquartered in New York. Its European regional headquarters is on the property of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in Haarlemmermeer, Netherlands.

==Destinations==
Nippon Cargo Airlines serves the following destinations (as of June 2024):

===Codeshare agreements===
Nippon Cargo Airlines codeshares with the following airlines:
* Cargolux
* Singapore Airlines Cargo

== Fleet ==
===Current fleet===

As of February 2024, NCA&#x27;s fleet consists of the following aircraft:

===Fleet development===
*On 9 June 2005 Nippon Cargo Airline&#x27;s first Boeing 747-400F was delivered in Everett, Washington, the first of four ordered by the airline.
*In June 2006, NCA ordered two additional Boeing 747-400F to eight that had already been ordered. These aircraft were delivered beginning in 2008 and replaced the Boeing 747-200F. By May 2009, the ten 747-400 had been delivered, but the last two were placed with Cargo B Airlines, a Belgian operator which NCA owned shares of. Cargo B filed for bankruptcy in May 2009, and the two aircraft were placed into storage. Subsequently, both were leased (or possibly sold) to AirBridgeCargo Airlines.
*In 2007 the airline had ordered 14 Boeing 747-8 freighter aircraft and has taken delivery of eight examples. In 2015 it cancelled outstanding orders for four of the aircraft, but still retains options on two more. It is thought to be due to the downturn of cargo volumes in the Asia Pacific region. In 2017, it cancelled the remaining two options of the aircraft, leaving the airline with no further unfulfilled aircraft orders.

===Former fleet===
Nippon Cargo Airlines previously operated the following aircraft:

<doc id="142262" wikidata="Q579826" url="?curid=142262" title="Debbie Does Dallas">
<text>Debbie Does Dallas is a 1978 American pornographic film produced and directed by Jim Clark, and starring Bambi Woods. The plot focuses on a team of cheerleaders attempting to earn enough money to send the title character to Dallas, Texas to try out for the famous &quot;Texas Cowgirls&quot; cheerleading squad. The fictional name &quot;Texas Cowgirls&quot; was seen as an allusion to the real-life Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. Woods had previously tried out for the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders in real life, but was cut during auditions.

The film was highly successful, selling 50,000 copies on videotape, making it the most successful pornographic video release of its time. It is regarded as one of the most important releases during the so-called &quot;Golden Age of Porn&quot; (1969–1984), and became one of the best-known pornographic films of the 1980s. The film is in the public domain following a US court ruling in 1987 that declared its copyright to be lost.

The enormous success spawned a number of sequels and spin-offs, and a 2002 off-Broadway musical of the same name.

==Plot==
Debbie Benton, captain of her high school cheerleading squad, has been accepted to try out for the &quot;Texas Cowgirls&quot;. Her parents disapprove and refuse to pay her fare to Texas. In a bid to help Debbie, her squadmates Lisa, Roberta, Tammy, Pat and Annie decide to accompany her to Texas. With two weeks to raise the money, they swear off sexual activity with their boyfriends and form a company, called Teen Services.

Tammy takes a job in the local record store run by Nick. Debbie gets a job at a sports store run by Mr. Greenfeld. Roberta convinces Mr. Hardwick to give her a job at the candle store with Mrs. Hardwick. Rikki and Annie agree to wash Mr. Bradly&#x27;s car.

The football team is annoyed by a lack of sex. Roberta&#x27;s boyfriend Rick and his teammates join Roberta and Pat in the showers, where they have group sex. While working for Mr. Greenfeld at the sports store, Debbie is talked into allowing Mr. Greenfeld to see her breasts for $10 and fondle her breasts for another $10. Then, he sucks them for an additional $20.

Realizing they will not be able to raise enough money by legitimate means, Debbie convinces the other girls to engage in sexual activities for more money. They agree, but only if it is on their terms.

After Roberta is caught masturbating around Mrs. Hardwick, Roberta engages in sexual activity with Mr. and Mrs. Hardwick, earning extra money. Rikki and Annie go to see Mr. Bradly, to wash his car. Mr. Bradly is not home, but they wash his car anyway. When Mr. Bradly returns home, he asks them in to dry off their wet clothes. They undress for him for $10 each. He performs cunnilingus on them, they each fellate him and then he has anal sex with Annie.

At the library, Donna flirts with Mr. Biddle, the librarian. Visiting her at work, her boyfriend Tim tries to have sex with her. She fellates him but is caught by Mr. Biddle. Donna allows him to spank her to prevent him from telling her parents. Hamilton and his friend Ashly are in the tennis club sauna after a tennis game, and Hamilton convinces Lisa to fellate him while Ashly penetrates her.

At the record store, Tammy has been avoiding Tony&#x27;s advances; she calls Lisa, who joins them at the record store. Lisa offers Tony &quot;anything&quot; and she begins to fellate him, and then Tammy joins in, and he ejaculates on Tammy&#x27;s breasts.

In the final scene, Debbie arrives at Mr. Greenfeld&#x27;s store after hours, in a Texas Cowgirls uniform as he requested. Greenfeld, dressed in a green-and-white number 12 football jersey (a trademark of Joe Namath), reveals his dream of being the quarterback who makes love to the head cheerleader, and she obliges. She fellates him, and he penetrates her vagina with his finger and performs cunnilingus on her. Then they engage in vaginal sex, first in the missionary position, then doggy style, and then with Debbie on top. They finish in the missionary position with Mr. Greenfeld pulling out right before ejaculating.

==Production==
The movie was produced and directed by Jim Clark. Some scenes were shot at the Brooklyn College athletic field and the Pratt Institute library in Brooklyn, New York. An urban legend claimed that certain scenes were shot at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, including the library scene. However, this was declared unlikely after an investigation with alumni, and the president of the film&#x27;s distributor VCX called the rumor &quot;purely inconclusive&quot;.

== Legal issues ==
=== Trademark ===
New York&#x27;s Pussycat Theater was enjoined in 1979 from showing the film by the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders under the Lanham Act, arguing that their uniforms were mimicked by the film&#x27;s producers and used in advertising, infringing on their trademarks. The theater argued that uniforms are strictly functional items, but in affirming the lower court&#x27;s decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that &quot;[i]t is well established that, if the design of an item is nonfunctional and has acquired secondary meaning, the design may become a trademark even if the item itself is functional.&quot; The decision has been criticized on free speech grounds, but the Seventh Circuit has cited it for the proposition that &quot;confusion about sponsorship or approval, even when the mark does not mislead consumers about the source of the goods,&quot; may be sufficient to state a claim under Lanham Act 43(a).

===Copyright===
When the film opened in October 1978, it was exhibited without a copyright notice. In 1979, rights-holder M &amp; A Associates entered into an exclusive worldwide video distribution deal with VCX, whereby VCX agreed to pay M &amp; A an advance and make royalty payments on each sale. Upon receiving a print of the film, VCX president Norman Arno contacted M &amp; A president Arthur Weisberg to request copyright protection. Arno also retained the services of attorneys John Lappen and Peter Berger to combat unauthorized copying of the film. Before litigation could commence, VCX was required to add copyright notices to all copies of the film and file registration with the United States Copyright Office; however, VCX could not protect the rights by just adding a notice to the video cassette, since one also needed to be added to the theatrical prints. In 1981, Berger informed Weisberg of the need to add a copyright notice to the prints that had been sent to various theaters, but Weisberg refused. Both Lappen and Berger concluded the copyright had been lost, and in 1982, VCX terminated their contract with M &amp; A and ceased making royalty payments, but continued to distribute the film. In 1987 M &amp; A brought a case against VCX in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan for breach of contract. VCX argued that the contract was void due to M &amp; A&#x27;s failure to comply with the Copyright Act of 1976. The court found in favor of VCX, and the judge ruled that &quot;Weisberg&#x27;s actions had thrust the film irretrievably into the [United States] public domain.&quot;

=== Obscenity ===
In 1983, a court case in New York, &quot;United States v. Various Articles of Obscene Merchandise&quot;, found the film not to be obscene.

The 1986 publication of the Meese Report contains graphic descriptions of sex scenes and uncensored dialogue from &quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot; as well as from other movies, including the hit movie &quot;Deep Throat&quot;. The Report gives a clinical account of pictures in magazines like &quot;Tri-Sexual Lust&quot;, and provides a list of 2,370 film titles and 725 book titles ranging from &quot;Horny Holy Roller Family&quot; to &quot;Thoroughly Amorous Amy&quot;. The explicit content made the Meese Report a best seller.

==Legacy==
&quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot; inspired numerous sequels, remakes and spin-offs in the decades since its release. Journalist David Slayden is quoted as saying, &quot;No other pornographic film has been remade more often than &quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot;.&quot; The sequels include:

Spin-offs include:

===Stage musical===
In 2001, &quot;Debbie Does Dallas: The Musical&quot; was created by Susan L. Schwartz for the New York International Fringe Festival. In 2002, it went off-Broadway. Unlike the original film, the musical did not contain any actual sex or nudity, sparking disappointment among audiences, as false hype had been made and the producers did nothing to dismiss it. Since, the show has been performed globally, often with racier direction and more explicit choreography. The story, dialogue and characters are fairly faithful, with musical numbers standing in for sex scenes or added for comic effect. As recent as 2015, it continues to be performed.

===Television===
In 2005, a documentary called &quot;Debbie Does Dallas Uncovered&quot; was produced and shown on British television.

===Remasters and re-releases===
In 2006, VCX employed Media Blasters to digitally re-master from the original 35mm film into a &quot;Definitive Collectors Edition&quot; 2-Disc set on DVD.

On April 11, 2007, Vivid Entertainment Group began including the original feature alongside a new release, &quot;Debbie Does Dallas ... Again&quot; in DVD, Blu-ray and HD DVD formats. It has also been remade with contemporary porn actors.

<doc id="142264" wikidata="Q1271324" url="?curid=142264" title="Thrilla in Manila">
<text>Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier III, billed as the Thrilla in Manila, was the third and final professional boxing match between undisputed champion Muhammad Ali, and former champion Joe Frazier, for the heavyweight championship of the world. The bout was conceded after fourteen rounds on October 1, 1975, at the Araneta Coliseum in Cubao, Quezon City, Philippines, located in Rizal at the time of the event (later Metro Manila shortly after the event). The venue was temporarily renamed the &quot;Philippine Coliseum&quot; for this match. Ali won by corner retirement (RTD) after Frazier&#x27;s chief second, Eddie Futch, asked the referee to stop the fight after the 14th round. The contest&#x27;s name is derived from Ali&#x27;s rhyming boast that the fight would be &quot;a killa and a thrilla and a chilla, when I get that gorilla in Manila.&quot;

The bout is almost universally regarded as one of the best and most brutal fights in boxing history, and was the culmination of a three-bout rivalry between the two fighters that Ali won, 2–1. Some sources estimate the fight was watched by 1billion viewers, including 100million viewers watching the fight on closed-circuit theatre television, and 500,000 pay-per-view buys on HBO home cable television.

==Background==
The first fight between Frazier and Ali–– promoted as the &quot;Fight of the Century&quot;–– took place on March 8, 1971, in New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. Frazier was the undefeated champion and won by unanimous decision over the previously undefeated former champion Ali, who had been stripped of his titles for refusing to enter the draft for the Vietnam War.

Their showdown was a fast-paced, 15-round bout, with Frazier scoring the fight&#x27;s only knockdown, at the beginning of the final round.

When the rivals met in a January 1974 rematch, neither was champion; Frazier had suffered a stunning second-round knockout by George Foreman a year earlier, and Ali had two controversial split bouts with Ken Norton. In a promotional appearance before the second fight, the two had scuffled in an ABC studio during an interview segment with Howard Cosell.

There were controversial aspects to the fight. In the second round, Ali struck Frazier with a hard right hand, which backed him up. Referee Tony Perez stepped between the fighters, signifying the end of the round, even though there were about 25 seconds left. In so doing, he gave Frazier time to regain his bearings and continue fighting. Perez also failed to contain Ali&#x27;s tactic of illegally holding and pulling down his opponent&#x27;s neck in the clinches, which helped Ali to smother Frazier, and gain the 12-round decision. This became a major issue in selecting the referee for the Manila bout.

==Pre-fight promotions and training==
The president of the Philippines Ferdinand Marcos sought to hold the bout and sponsor it in order to bring attention to the Philippines from around the world.

In the lead-up to the Manila fight, as well as each of their other two encounters, Ali verbally abused Frazier. Ali nicknamed Frazier &quot;The Gorilla&quot;, and used this as the basis for the rhyme, &quot;It will be a killa and a thrilla and a chilla when I get the Gorilla in Manila,&quot; which he chanted while punching a gorilla doll. Ali told reporter Dick Schaap that it was part of a longstanding pre-fight strategy of his: &quot;I like to get a man mad, because when a man&#x27;s &quot;mad&quot;, he wants ya so bad, he can&#x27;t think, so I like to get a man mad.&quot; This strategy had appeared to work in Ali&#x27;s favor in his defeat of George Foreman. Frazier had skill, confidence, stamina and the character to persevere in difficult circumstances. Dave Wolf (who was a member of the Frazier team in Manila) said: &quot;With all of the residue of anger that Joe had from what had happened before the first fight, what had happened before and during the second fight and after these fights, Joe was ready to lay his life on the line, and ... he did.&quot;

Ali&#x27;s preparations were upset before the fight when he introduced his mistress, Veronica Porché, as his wife to Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos. This angered his wife, Khalilah Ali, who saw the introduction on television back in the States, and subsequently flew to Manila, where she engaged her husband in a prolonged shouting match in his hotel suite.

In the Frazier camp, trainer Eddie Futch made the decision that the throngs of people and the tension in the steaming hot city were a poor environment to prepare in. Thus, Frazier completed his training for what was to be his final shot at the championship in a lush, quiet setting in the mountainous outskirts of the city of Manila. There, he led a spartan existence, often sitting for hours in a contemplative state in preparation for the bout.

==Fight strategy and referee selection==
Frazier cornerman Eddie Futch was concerned about preventing Ali from repeating the illegal tactic of holding Frazier behind the neck to create extended clinches. Ali used this tactic to keep Frazier from getting inside and enable himself to get needed rest during his victory in their second meeting. Futch claimed that Ali had done this 133 times in that fight without being penalized. He also had done so in their first meeting, and did it while facing the taller Foreman in his win over him in Zaire, leaving little doubt as to his intentions for the upcoming bout in Manila. Sensing trouble, Futch moved to block (Ali-Foreman ref) Zach Clayton as referee by enlisting the aid of Philadelphia mayor Frank Rizzo. The mayor refused to let Clayton out of his duties as a Philadelphia civil service employee to go referee the fight. Futch also warned Filipino authorities that Ali was going to mar what was to be a great event for their nation by constantly tying up Frazier illegally. He advised them to assign one of their countrymen to referee the bout, stating that this would reflect well on the Philippines, and be a source of pride for its people. Futch and Filipino officials (who bought in heavily to the idea) brushed aside complaints from Don King that a Filipino referee would be too small to handle a heavyweight fight. This resulted in the appointment of Filipino Carlos Padilla, Jr.

Futch and his assistant, George Benton, believed that the key to winning the fight would be for Frazier to persistently attack Ali&#x27;s body, including when Ali attempted to cover up his torso along the ropes. Benton said, &quot;My expression to Joe was what you&#x27;ve got to do is stay on top of him, and hit the son of a bitch anywhere, hit him on the hips, hit him on the legs. You hit him anywhere!&quot;

Frazier&#x27;s strategy followed the boxing axiom &quot;if you kill the body, the head will die.&quot; As he described it, &quot;Once I&#x27;ve stopped your organs—when those kidneys and liver stop functioning, he can&#x27;t move so fast ... The organs in his body have to be functioning. If you slow them down, he cannot do what he wants to do.&quot;

Hitting below the waist, according to the rules of all sanctioning bodies, is equally as illegal as holding behind the head.

The Ali camp used the championship as leverage in negotiations and won out on two key points. The ring size of square allowed him the ability to move and circle the ring if he so chose, which would enable him to use his superior boxing skills to his advantage. He also got his preference for gloves, which were smaller and less padded than those used in most heavyweight bouts. According to Ali&#x27;s ring doctor, Ferdie Pacheco, Ali planned to take advantage of Frazier&#x27;s reputation as a slow starter, and use his superior reach and hand speed to attack Frazier exclusively with punches to the head in the early rounds in the hopes of scoring a knockout, or at least doing enough damage to Frazier to prevent him from fighting effectively as the bout wore on.

==Fight details==
In order to accommodate an international viewing audience, the fight took place at 10:00a.m. local time. Though it served the business interests of the fight, it was detrimental to the fighters. Ali&#x27;s ring physician, Ferdie Pacheco, said &quot;At 10:00a.m. the stickiness of the night was still there, but cooked by the sun. So what you got is boiling water for atmosphere.&quot; Denise Menz, who was part of Frazier&#x27;s contingent, said of the conditions inside the aluminum-roofed Philippine Coliseum: &quot;It was so intensely hot, I&#x27;ve never before felt heat like that in my life. Not a breath of air—nothing. And that was sitting there. Can you imagine being in the ring? I don&#x27;t know how they did it.&quot; Frazier estimated the ring temperature at more than , including heat from TV lights. Ali said that he lost during the fight due to dehydration.

When the fighters and their cornermen met at the center of the ring for the referee&#x27;s instructions, Ali continued his verbal assault on Joe Frazier, finishing with the taunt: &quot;You don&#x27;t have it, Joe, you don&#x27;t have it! I&#x27;m going to put you away!&quot; In response, Frazier smiled and said &quot;We&#x27;ll see.&quot;

Ali was sharp early, as the slow-starting Frazier could not bob and weave his way inside of Ali&#x27;s jab. Ali won the first two rounds. He kept Frazier in the center of the ring, and landed several straight right hands immediately after his left jab. Frazier was wobbled by solid punches twice in the early rounds. Commenting for the U.S. television audience, Don Dunphy said, &quot;Ali with his fast hands and sharp shooting keeps it his way.&quot; Viewing the fight for the first time some 31 years later, Frazier said, &quot;Too far away, needed to get closer.&quot;

Ali also continued to attack his opponent verbally, most noticeably in the 3rd round when he was performing well and had plenty of energy. Referee Carlos Padilla said, &quot;During the fight [Ali] would say &#x27;Ah one ah two and a three ... Jack be nimble and Jack be quick, Jack jump over the candlestick. Is that all you can give? Come on, you ugly gorilla—hit me!&#x27;&quot; Several times, Ali made circular hand gestures at Frazier to encourage him closer.

During round 3, Ali began using the &quot;rope-a-dope&quot;, a strategy in which he used the ropes for support and rest while allowing his opponent to expend energy throwing punches. When it was effective, Ali would eventually spin off the ropes and unleash a volley of punches in rapid succession against an arm-weary opponent. In Manila, it did not always work out that way. Frazier landed his first good body punches of the fight in the 3rd round with Ali pinned in the corner. Due to his general lack of reach and arthritic right elbow, Frazier needed to be close to Ali to hit him with frequency, and the rope-a-dope enabled him to do that. About two minutes into the round, Ali threw a succession of hard punches, many of which missed. Commenting for the BBC, Harry Carpenter said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ve seen Ali in as aggressive a mood as this. He really looks as if he wants to nail Frazier to the canvas for once and all.&quot;

During the fifth round, Frazier&#x27;s timing and the rhythm of his bobbing and weaving improved. He was able to avoid the oncoming fists of the champion and, for the first time in the fight, land solid left hooks to Ali&#x27;s head. Ali spent much of the round along the ropes. According to his trainer, Angelo Dundee, this &quot;was the worst thing he could do because he&#x27;s making Joe pick up momentum where he could drive those shots to the body.&quot; Ali&#x27;s method of self-defense also worsened noticeably in the fifth. Boxing journalist Jerry Izenberg, who was ringside, said, &quot;Somewhere about the 4th or 5th round Joe hit him with a right hand. I didn&#x27;t think Joe could tie his shoes with his right hand and Ali pulls back and says, &#x27;You don&#x27;t have no right hand, you can&#x27;t do that.&#x27; and bing! he hits him with another right hand. Suddenly Ali had to think &#x27;Well there are two hands in this fight on the other side&#x27;. That was very important.&quot; His guard also visibly lowered in this round as a result of the vicious body attack he was absorbing. The net effect was that Ali became much more exposed to Frazier&#x27;s most lethal his left hook.

Shortly after the bell rang to start the 6th round Frazier landed a thunderous left hook which thudded against the right side of Ali&#x27;s face. Ali was knocked back by the force of the blow, and landed in the ropes behind him. He did not appear dazed or groggy, but was visibly stiff in his body movements while backing away from the oncoming Frazier, and continuing to throw punches of his own. Seconds later, Frazier landed a tremendous, whipping left hook to Ali&#x27;s head. Again Ali landed in the ropes behind him, but he only gave the appearance of being slightly dazed and stiff-legged. Ali remained standing and was able to finish the round without being knocked down. Years later, watching the event on video, Frazier shook his head at the sight of Ali withstanding the powerful blows. Jerry Izenberg observed, &quot;They were tremendous hooks, and you have to understand, normal fighters would not have continued. It would have been over.&quot; According to Ed Schuyler of Associated Press, who was present at ringside, Ali reacted to Frazier&#x27;s sixth-round barrage by saying (at the start of the next round), &quot;They told me Joe Frazier was washed up,&quot; to which Frazier retorted: &quot;They lied.&quot;

As the bout wore on it became clear that despite his belief in the utility of the rope-a-dope, when Ali had his back against the ropes, Frazier had the advantage. Smokin&#x27; Joe was able to wear down his opponent with body punches, left hooks to the head, and occasionally, short, chopping right hands. Meanwhile, the long-armed champion had a difficult time getting much power into his punches while fighting on the inside. Dundee, who detested the rope-a-dope (never more so than in Manila) constantly beseeched his fighter to &quot;get off the goddamn ropes!&quot; Beginning at the start of round 7, Ali managed to do so effectively for about a round and a half, and was able to best Frazier in exhausting toe-to-toe exchanges during the opening minute of round 8—described on the telecast as &quot;a big rally by Ali.&quot; Later in that round, an arm-weary Ali began to be beaten to the punch by the challenger. During the final minute of round 8, Ali sagged against the ropes in a neutral corner as Frazier landed a series of punches to his body and head. On the broadcast, Dunphy excitedly told his audience near the end of the round: &quot;Frazier may have evened up the round!&quot; 

At the close of a very trying ninth round, a visibly tired Ali went back to his corner, and told his trainer: &quot;Man, this is the closest I&#x27;ve ever been to dying.&quot; In the opposite corner, Frazier was suffering from pronounced swelling about the face—the result of an accumulation of scores of punches exclusively aimed at his head, increasingly hampering his vision. After an 11th round, in which Ali landed frequently, Eddie Futch confronted his charge, asking him: &quot;What&#x27;s with this right-hand business?&quot; In response, Frazier indicated that he could not see some of the punches he was being hit with. At this point, Futch gave him what turned out to be poor advice—he told his fighter to stand more upright when approaching Ali rather than continuing his usual bobbing and weaving style. Ali seized upon this immediately in Round 12. With his back to the ropes, he threw many punches with both hands that landed accurately and did still more damage to Frazier&#x27;s limited eyesight. Adding to Frazier&#x27;s problems was his corner&#x27;s inability to maintain a functional icebag to apply to his eye past the middle rounds because of the oppressive heat inside the Philippine Coliseum. As Frazier rose from his stool to contest Round 13 he was a combatant who could barely see.

British sportswriter Frank McGhee ringside for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; describes the final rounds:

The main turning point of the fight came very late. It came midway through the thirteenth round when one of two tremendous right-hand smashes sent the gum shield sailing out of Frazier&#x27;s mouth. The sight of this man actually moving backwards seemed to inspire Ali. I swear he hit Frazier with thirty tremendous punches—each one as hard as those which knocked out George Foreman in Zaire—during the fourteenth round. He was dredging up all his own last reserves of power to make sure there wouldn&#x27;t have to be a fifteenth round.

Seeing the results of round 14, Eddie Futch decided to stop the fight between rounds rather than risk a similar or worse fate for Frazier in the 15th. Frazier protested stopping the fight, shouting &quot;I want him, boss,&quot; and trying to get Futch to change his mind. Futch replied, &quot;It&#x27;s all over. No one will forget what you did here today&quot;, and signaled to referee Carlos Padilla, Jr., to end the bout. Ali would later claim that this was the closest to dying he had ever been. Unbeknownst to Frazier&#x27;s corner, at the end of the 14th round Ali instructed his cornermen to cut his gloves off, but Dundee ignored him. Ali later told his biographer Thomas Hauser, &quot;Frazier quit just before I did. I didn&#x27;t think I could fight anymore.&quot;

When the fight ended, Ali was ahead on the scorecards of all three officials. Using the 5-point must scoring system, referee Carlos Padilla Jr. had the champion ahead, 66-60, Judge Alfredo Quiazon had it 67-62 and Judge Larry Nadayag had it 66-62.

==Aftermath==
&quot;Ring&quot; magazine would name this their 1975 &quot;Fight of the Year&quot; and the 12th round would be named &quot;Round of the Year&quot;.

==Legacy==
The Philippines&#x27; first multi-level commercial shopping mall was named after Muhammad Ali as a tribute to his victory. The mall is named &quot;Ali Mall&quot; and is located in Araneta Center, Cubao, Quezon City almost right beside the Araneta Coliseum in which the &quot;Thrilla in Manila&quot; took place.

Another legacy of this fight was its pioneering use of communication technology. On September 30, 1975, HBO became the first television network in history to deliver a continuous signal via satellite by broadcasting the &quot;Thrilla in Manila&quot;. This event linking satellites with cable turned cable television from a re-transmitter to a program provider. Kay Koplovitz, the woman who oversaw cable and satellite broadcasting of the match for HBO, went on to create the &quot;Madison Square Garden Sports Network&quot;, which later became the USA Network, in 1977.

ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCentury&quot; ranked this event #5 in its &quot;Greatest Games of the 20th Century&quot; in 1999.

In 2006, the Manny Pacquiao vs. Óscar Larios fight in the Philippines was billed as &quot;Thrilla in Manila 2&quot;.

In 2008, the &quot;Thrilla in Manila&quot; television documentary was produced by Darlow Smithson Productions and aired on HBO. This documentary was met with mixed reviews with some accusing it of being biased towards Frazier, as most of the people interviewed were from Frazier&#x27;s camp. Promoter Bob Arum called it &quot;disgusting&quot;, said it was designed to demean Ali, and that it was filled with inaccuracies and called it an &quot;unfair attack on Muhammad Ali&quot;.

<text>Amberley Museum is an open-air industrial heritage museum at Amberley, near Arundel in West Sussex, England. The museum is owned and operated by Amberley Museum and Heritage Centre, a not-for-profit company and registered charity, and has the support of an active Friends organisation. The items in the Museums collection are held by The Amberley Museum Trust

The museum was founded in 1978 by the Southern Industrial History Centre Trust and has previously been known as the Amberley Working Museum, Amberley Chalk Pits Museum, and Amberley Museum and Heritage Centre. It is located within historic chalk quarries. Chalk was extracted and processed for lime on site for more than 100 years, and the museum still houses a number of its original lime kilns. In addition, holdings and exhibitions at the museum cover a diversity of industrial and local heritage collections, including narrow-gauge railways, local bus services, and a multitude of light and rural industrial subjects.

==Location==
The open-air museum is 36-acre (146,000 m2), located next to Amberley railway station and dedicated to the industrial heritage of South East England and with a special interest in aspects of the history of communications and transport.

The museum is sited in a former chalk quarry where the chalk was converted into lime for use in mortar and cement, and remaining on site are several kilns, including a De Witt set, and associated buildings including offices, bagging shed and locomotive shed.

Also to be seen is the quarry tunnel, which appeared as Mainstrike Mine in the James Bond film &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;. Additional buildings have been relocated or replicated on the site and exhibition halls added. The natural history and geology of the site can be seen from a nature trail.

<doc id="142267" wikidata="Q716658" url="?curid=142267" title="Arundel">
<text>Arundel ( ) is a market town and civil parish in the Arun District of the South Downs, West Sussex, England.

The much-conserved town has a medieval castle and Roman Catholic cathedral. Arundel has a museum and comes second behind much larger Chichester in its number of listed buildings in West Sussex. The River Arun runs through the eastern side of the town.

Arundel was one of the boroughs reformed by the Municipal Reform Act 1835. From 1836 to 1889 the town had its own Borough police force with a strength of three. In 1974 it became part of the Arun district, and is now a civil parish with a town council.

==Name==
The name comes from the Old English &quot;Hārhūnedell&quot;, meaning &quot;valley of horehound&quot;, and was first recorded in the Domesday Book. Folk etymology, however, connects the name with the Old French word &quot;arondelle&quot;, meaning &quot;swallow&quot;, and swallows appear on the town&#x27;s arms.

==Governance==

An electoral ward of the same name exists. This ward stretches north to Houghton with a total population at the 2011 census of 4,298. Arundel Town Council is based at Arundel Town Hall.

==Geography==
Arundel civil parish occupies an area somewhat larger than its built-up clusters, with the old town towards the north and the new to the south, separated by a main road.

Arundel town is a major bridging point over the River Arun as it was the lowest road bridge until the opening of the Littlehampton swing bridge in 1908. Arundel Castle was built by the Normans to protect that vulnerable fairly wooded plain to the north of the valley through the South Downs. The town later grew up on the slope below the castle to the south. The river was previously called the Tarrant and was renamed after the town by antiquarians in a back-formation.

Arundel includes meadows to the south but is clustered north of the A27 road, which narrowly avoids the town centre by a short and congested single carriageway bypass. Plans for a more extensive, HQDC bypass were debated intensely between 1980 and 2010 and a junction was built for it at Crossbush. In Spring 2018, Highways England published their preferred route for the new bypass. During 2018-19 there is a further period of consultation when views on a more detailed design for the dual carriageway will be sought.

Arundel railway station is on the Arun Valley Line. The Monarch&#x27;s Way long-distance footpath passes through the town and crosses the river here, while just under north and northwest of the town the route of the South Downs Way runs.

The town itself lies outside the boundaries of the South Downs National Park.

==Society==

Arundel is home to Arundel Castle, seat of the Duke of Norfolk; and to Arundel Cathedral, seat of the (Catholic) Bishop of Arundel and Brighton.

On 6 July 2004, Arundel was granted Fairtrade Town status.

People born in Arundel are known locally as Mullets, due to the presence of mullet in the River Arun.

Arundel is home to one of the oldest Scout Groups in the world. 1st Arundel (Earl of Arundel&#x27;s Own) Scout Group was formed in 1908 only a few weeks after Scouting began. Based in an HQ in Green Lane Close, it has active sections of Beaver Scouts, Cub Scouts and Scouts.
==Sport and leisure==

Arundel has a non-League football club Arundel F.C. which plays at Mill Road.

The town also has its own cricket ground at the castle, often cited as being one of the country&#x27;s most picturesque. It hosts Sussex County Cricket Club for a number of games each season.

==Notable people==
*Christopher Alexander, architect.
*Eluned Allen-Williams, Girl Guide executive, in 1975 became the first woman to hold position of chair on the Arundel bench
*Mary Chater, composer, Music Advisor to the Girl Guides and Justice of the Peace for Arundel from 1945 to 1961.
*Nigel Cumberland, author.

<text>Cardioversion is a medical procedure by which an abnormally fast heart rate (tachycardia) or other cardiac arrhythmia is converted to a normal rhythm using electricity or drugs. 

Synchronized electrical cardioversion uses a therapeutic dose of electric current to the heart at a specific moment in the cardiac cycle, restoring the activity of the electrical conduction system of the heart. (Defibrillation uses a therapeutic dose of electric current to the heart at a random moment in the cardiac cycle, and is the most effective resuscitation measure for cardiac arrest associated with ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia.) Pharmacologic cardioversion, also called chemical cardioversion, uses antiarrhythmia medication instead of an electrical shock.
==Electrical==
To perform synchronized electrical cardioversion, two electrode pads are used (or, alternatively, the traditional hand-held &quot;paddles&quot;), each comprising a metallic plate which is faced with a saline based conductive gel. The pads are placed on the chest of the patient, or one is placed on the chest and one on the back. These are connected by cables to a machine which has the combined functions of an ECG display screen and the electrical function of a defibrillator. A synchronizing function (either manually operated or automatic) allows the cardioverter to deliver a reversion shock, by way of the pads, of a selected amount of electric current over a predefined number of milliseconds at the optimal moment in the cardiac cycle which corresponds to the R wave of the QRS complex on the ECG.

Timing the shock to the R wave prevents the delivery of the shock during the vulnerable period (or relative refractory period) of the cardiac cycle, which could induce ventricular fibrillation. If the patient is conscious, various drugs are often used to help sedate the patient and make the procedure more tolerable. However, if the patient is hemodynamically unstable or unconscious, the shock is given immediately upon confirmation of the arrhythmia. When synchronized electrical cardioversion is performed as an elective procedure, the shocks can be performed in conjunction with drug therapy until sinus rhythm is attained. After the procedure, the patient is monitored to ensure stability of the sinus rhythm.

Synchronized electrical cardioversion is used to treat hemodynamically unstable supraventricular (or narrow complex) tachycardias, including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. It is also used in the emergent treatment of wide complex tachycardias, including ventricular tachycardia, when a pulse is present. Pulseless ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation are treated with unsynchronized shocks referred to as defibrillation. Electrical therapy is inappropriate for sinus tachycardia, which should always be a part of the differential diagnosis.

==Medication==
Various antiarrhythmic agents can be used to return the heart to normal sinus rhythm. Pharmacological cardioversion is an especially good option in patients with atrial fibrillation of recent onset. Drugs that are effective at maintaining normal rhythm after electric cardioversion can also be used for pharmacological cardioversion. Drugs like amiodarone, diltiazem, verapamil and metoprolol are frequently given before electrical cardioversion to decrease the heart rate, stabilize the patient and increase the chance that cardioversion is successful. There are various classes of agents that are most effective for pharmacological cardioversion.

Class I agents are sodium (Na) channel blockers (which slow conduction by blocking the Na+ channel) and are divided into 3 subclasses a, b and c. Class Ia slows phase 0 depolarization in the ventricles and increases the absolute refractory period. Procainamide, quinidine and disopyramide are Class Ia agents. Class 1b drugs lengthen phase 3 repolarization. They include lidocaine, mexiletine and phenytoin. Class Ic greatly slow phase 0 depolarization in the ventricles (however unlike 1a have no effect on the refractory period). Flecainide, moricizine and propafenone are Class Ic agents.
Class II agents are beta blockers which inhibit SA and AV node depolarization and slow heart rate. They also decrease cardiac oxygen demand and can prevent cardiac remodeling. Not all beta blockers are the same; some are cardio selective (affecting only beta 1 receptors) while others are non-selective (affecting beta 1 and 2 receptors). Beta blockers that target the beta-1 receptor are called cardio selective because beta-1 is responsible for increasing heart rate; hence a beta blocker will slow the heart rate.

Class III agents (prolong repolarization by blocking outward K+ current): amiodarone and sotalol are effective class III agents. Ibutilide is another Class III agent but has a different mechanism of action (acts to promote influx of sodium through slow-sodium channels). It has been shown to be effective in acute cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.

Class IV drugs are calcium (Ca) channel blockers. They work by inhibiting the action potential of the SA and AV nodes.

If the patient is stable, adenosine may be used for restoration of sinus rhythm in patients with macro-reentrant supraventricular tachycardias. It causes a short-lived cessation of conduction through the atrio-ventricular node breaking the circus movement through the node and the macro-reentrant pathway restoring sinus rhythm.

== Procedure ==

=== Preparation ===

Cardioversion for restoration of sinus rhythm from an atrial rhythm is largely a scheduled procedure. In addition to cardiology, anesthesiology is also usually involved to ensure comfort of the patient for the duration of the shock therapy. The presence of registered nurses, physician associates, or other medical personnel may also be helpful during the procedure.

Before starting the procedure, the patient&#x27;s chest and back will be prepped for electrode placement. The skin should be free of any oily substances (e.g., lotions) and hair which may otherwise interfere with adhesion of the pads. Once this is complete, the medical team will adhere the pads to the patient using a rolling motion to ensure the absence of air pockets. &quot;(see details on pad placement below)&quot;. The anesthesiology team will then administer a general anesthetic (e.g., Propofol) in order to ensure patient comfort and amnesia during the procedure. Opioid analgesics (e.g., Fentanyl) may be combined with Propofol, although anesthesiology must weight the benefits against adverse effects including apnea. Bite blocks and extremity restraints are then utilized to prevent self-injury during cardioversion. Once these medications are administered, the glabellar reflex or eyelash reflex may be used to determine the patient&#x27;s level of consciousness.

The pads are connected to a machine that can interpret the patient&#x27;s cardiac rate and rhythm and deliver a shock at the appropriate time. The machine should synchronize (&#x27;sync&#x27;) with the R wave of the rhythm strip. Although uncommon, sometimes the machine will unintentionally sync to high amplitude T waves, so it is important to ensure that the machine is synced appropriately to R waves. Interpretation of the patient&#x27;s rhythm is imperative when using cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm from less emergent arrhythmias where a pulse is present (e.g., atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation). However, if a patient is confirmed to be in pulseless ventricular tachycardia &quot;v-tach&quot; or ventricular fibrillation &quot;v-fib&quot;, then a shock is delivered immediately upon connection of the pads. In this application, electrical cardioversion is more properly termed defibrillation.
=== Cardioversion ===

Once the machine is synced with the patient&#x27;s cardiac rhythm, the machine must be charged. To determine the amount of energy (measured in joules &quot;J&quot;) the patient requires, many factors are considered. As a rule of thumb, recent-onset atrial arrhythmias require less energy compared to persistent atrial arrhythmias. If the cardiologist suspects that the patient may be less respondent to cardioversion, a higher energy may be utilized. Once the machine is synced and charged, a shock can be delivered to the patient.

====Recommended Energy Levels====
* &quot;Atrial Flutter and SVT: 50-100 J for biphasic devices; 100 J for monophasic devices&quot;
* &quot;Atrial Fibrillation: 120-200 J for biphasic devices; 200 J for monophasic devices&quot;
* &quot;Ventricular Tachycardia (with a pulse): 100 J for biphasic devices; 200 J for monophasic devices&quot;
* &quot;Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia and Ventricular Fibrillation: 120-200 J for biphasic devices; 360 J for monophasic devices&quot;

=== After cardioversion ===

Following electrical cardioversion, the cardiologist will determine if sinus rhythm has been restored. To confirm sinus rhythm, a distinct P wave should be seen preceding each QRS complex. Additionally, each R-R interval should be evenly spaced. If sinus rhythm is restored, the pads may be disconnected, and any other medical equipment is removed from the patients (e.g., bite blocks, restraints, etc.). The patient will regain consciousness soon thereafter (the effects of Propofol generally last for only 3–8 minutes). However, if the arrhythmia is persistent, the machine may be re-charged to a higher energy level, and the cardioversion attempt may be repeated. It is recommended to wait 60 seconds between subsequent cardioversion attempts, but this amount of time may be adjusted based on the patient and/or provider.

== Electrode pad placement ==
Pad placement for electrical cardioversion a cardiac arrhythmia may be either anterior-posterior or anterior-lateral. In an anterior-posterior setup one pad is placed on the chest and the other pad is placed on the back. In an anterior-lateral setup, one pad is placed on the chest and the other pad is placed along the left midaxillary line. Choosing the right pad placement can be an important aspect when measuring the success of electrical cardioversion. For example, the anterior-posterior pad positioning is commonly used when attempting to restore an atrial arrhythmia as the vector between the pads predominately runs through the atria. The anterior-lateral pad positioning may be used when attempting to restore pulseless ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation as there may not be enough time or strength to apply an electrode the patient&#x27;s back.

=== Anterior-Posterior pad placement ===

The anterior pad should be placed inferior to the right clavicle while also being vertically centered over at the level of the right 4th intercostal space. The posterior pad should be placed just lateral to the left side of the spine and vertically centered at the level of T7. The inferior angle of the scapula can be used as a reference for the level of T7.

=== Anterior-Lateral pad placement ===

The anterior pad should be placed inferior to the right clavicle while also being vertically centered over at the level of the right 4th intercostal space. The lateral pad should be placed along the left midaxillary line at the level of the left 5th intercostal space. The left nipple can be used as a reference for the level of the left 4th intercostal space. From here, the midaxillary 5th intercostal space is identified by moving inferiorly one intercostal space and laterally towards the midaxillary line.

<text>The Negev ( ; ) or Negeb (), is a desert and semidesert region of southern Israel. The region&#x27;s largest city and administrative capital is Beersheba (pop. ), in the north. At its southern end is the Gulf of Aqaba and the resort city and port of Eilat. It contains several development towns, including Dimona, Arad, and Mitzpe Ramon, as well as a number of small Bedouin towns, including Rahat, Tel Sheva, and Lakiya. There are also several kibbutzim, including Revivim and Sde Boker; the latter became the home of Israel&#x27;s first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, after his retirement from politics.

Although historically part of a separate region (known during the Roman period as Arabia Petraea), the Negev was added to the proposed area of Mandatory Palestine, of which large parts later became Israel, on 10 July 1922, having been conceded by British representative St John Philby &quot;in Trans-Jordan&#x27;s name&quot;. Despite this, the region remained exclusively Arab until 1946; in response to the British Morrison–Grady Plan which would have allotted the area to an Arab state, the Jewish Agency enacted the 11 points in the Negev plan to begin Jewish settlement in the area. A year later, the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine allotted a larger part of the area to the Jewish State which became Israel.

The desert is home to the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, whose faculties include the Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research and the Albert Katz International School for Desert Studies, both located on the Midreshet Ben-Gurion campus adjacent to Sde Boker.

In October 2012, global travel guide publisher Lonely Planet rated the Negev second on a list of the world&#x27;s top ten regional travel destinations for 2013, noting its current transformation through development.
==Etymology==
The origin of the word &quot;Negev&quot; is from the Hebrew root denoting &#x27;dry&#x27;; in the Hebrew Bible, the word &quot;Negev&quot; is also used for the direction &#x27;south&#x27;. Some English-language translations use the spelling &quot;Negeb&quot;.

The Negev mentioned in the Bible (see below) consisted only of the northernmost part of the modern Israeli Negev, with the semiarid Arad-Beersheba Valley defined as &quot;the eastern (biblical) Negev&quot;.

In Arabic, the Negev is known as &quot;an-Naqab&quot; or &quot;an-Naqb&quot; (&#x27;the [mountain] pass&#x27;), though it was not thought of as a distinct region until the demarcation of the Egypt-Ottoman frontier in the 1890s and has no single Arabic name.

During the British Mandate, it was called &quot;Beersheba sub-district&quot;.

==Geography==
The Negev contains the oldest discovered surface on Earth, with an approximate age of 1.8 million years. During the Pleistocene, the Negev fluctuated between intervals of relative humidity and intervals of aridity similar to or even more severe than the present day; from around 80,000 to 13,000 years BP, during a time interval roughly corresponding to the Last Glacial Period, the Negev was significantly more humid than today. It covers more than half of Israel, over some , or at least 55% of the country&#x27;s land area. It forms an inverted triangle shape whose western side is contiguous with the desert of the Sinai Peninsula, and whose eastern border is the Arabah valley. The Negev has a number of interesting cultural and geological features. Among the latter are three enormous, craterlike makhteshim (box canyons), which are unique to the region: Makhtesh Ramon, HaMakhtesh HaGadol, and HaMakhtesh HaKatan.

The Negev is a rocky desert. It is a melange of brown, rocky, dusty mountains interspersed by wadis (dry riverbeds with plants that flower briefly after rain) and deep craters. It can be split into five different ecological regions: northern, western and central Negev, the high plateau and the Arabah Valley. The northern Negev, or Mediterranean zone, receives of rain annually and has fairly fertile soil. The western Negev receives of rain per year, with light and partially sandy soil. Sand dunes can reach heights of up to here. Home to the city of Beersheba, the central Negev has an annual precipitation of and is characterised by impervious soil, known as loess, allowing minimum penetration of water with greater soil erosion and water runoff. 

The high plateau area of Negev Mountains/Ramat HaNegev (, &quot;The Negev Heights&quot;) stands between and above sea level with extreme temperatures in summer and winter. The area receives of rain per year, with inferior and partially salty soil. The Arabah Valley along the Jordanian border stretches from Eilat in the south to the tip of the Dead Sea in the north. The Arabah Valley is very arid with barely of rain annually. It has inferior soil, in which little can grow without irrigation and special soil additives.

==Flora and fauna==
Vegetation in the Negev is sparse, but certain trees and plants thrive there, among them &quot;Acacia&quot;, &quot;Pistacia&quot;, &quot;Retama&quot;, &quot;Urginea maritima&quot; and &quot;Thymelaea&quot;. &quot;Hyphaene thebaica&quot; or doum palm can be found in the Southern Negev. The Evrona Nature Reserve is the most northerly point in the world where this palm can be found.
A small population of Arabian leopards, an endangered animal in the Arabian peninsula, has survived in the southern Negev but is now probably extinct. Other carnivora found in the Negev are the caracal, the striped hyena, the Arabian wolf, the golden jackal and the marbled polecat.

The Arabah Arabian gazelle survives with a few individuals in the Negev. The dorcas gazelle is more numerous, with some 1,000–1,500 individuals in the Negev. Some 350 to 500 Nubian ibex live in the Negev Highlands and in the Eilat Mountains.

The Negev shrew is a species of mammal of the family &quot;Soricidae&quot; that is found only in Israel. A population of the critically endangered Kleinmann&#x27;s tortoise (also known as the Negev tortoise) survives in the sands of the western and central Negev Desert.

Desert snails of the genus Euchondrus feed on endolithic lichens which live inside limestone rocks, converting rock and lichen into soil, and releasing between 22 and 27 milligrams of nitrogen per square metre of soil through their faeces.

Animals that were reintroduced after their extinction in the wild or localised extinction respectively are the Arabian oryx and the Asiatic wild ass, which in the Negev number about 250 animals.

Like many areas in Israel and the rest of the Middle East, the Negev used to host in the distant past the Asiatic lion and the Asiatic cheetah until their complete extinction at the hands of humans in later centuries.

==Climate==
The Negev region is arid (Eilat receives on average only of rainfall a year), receiving very little rain due to its location to the east of the Sahara (as opposed to the Mediterranean, which lies to the west of Israel), and extreme temperatures due to its location 31 degrees north. However the northernmost areas of the Negev, including Beersheba, are semi-arid. The usual rainfall total from June to October inclusive is zero. Snow and frost are rare in the northern Negev, and snow and frost are unknown in the vicinity of Eilat in the southernmost Negev.


==History==
===Prehistorical nomads===
Nomadic life in the Negev dates back at least 4,000 years and perhaps as much as 7,000 years.

===Bronze Age===
The first urbanised settlements were established by a combination of Canaanite, Amalekite, Amorite, Nabataean and Edomite groups . Pharaonic Egypt is credited with introducing copper mining and smelting in both the Negev and the Sinai between 1400 and 1300 BC.

===Biblical===
====Extent of biblical Negev====
According to Israeli archaeologists, in the Hebrew Bible, the term Negev only relates to the northern, semi-arid part of what we call Negev today; of this, the Arad-Beersheba Valley, which receives enough rain to permit agriculture and therefore sedentary occupation (the &quot;desert fringe&quot;), is accordingly defined as &quot;the eastern (biblical) Negev&quot;.

====Biblical reference====
According to the Book of Genesis chapter 13, Abraham lived for a while in the Negev after being banished from Egypt (). During the Exodus journey to the Promised Land, Moses sent twelve scouts into the Negev to assess the land and population (). Later the northern part of biblical Negev was inhabited by the Tribe of Judah and the southern part of biblical Negev by the Tribe of Simeon. The Negev was later part of the Kingdom of Solomon (in its entirety, all the way to the Red Sea), and then, with varied extension to the south, part of the Kingdom of Judah.

===Iron Age===
In the 9th century BC, development and expansion of mining in both the Negev and Edom (modern Jordan) coincided with the rise of the Assyrian Empire. Beersheba was the region&#x27;s capital and a centre for trade in the 8th century BCE. Small settlements of Israelites in the areas around the capital existed between 1020 and 928 BCE.

===Nabateans and Romans===
The 4th-century BC arrival of the Nabateans resulted in the development of irrigation systems that supported new urban centres located along the Negev incense route at Avdat (Oboda), Mamshit (Mampsis), Shivta (Sobata), Haluza (Elusa), and Nitzana (Nessana). This at least was the prevailing theory, until more recent research showed that the earliest form of Nabataean agriculture in the Negev Highlands was only based on spring-water irrigation, with the much more extensive run-off water harvesting techniques using barrages and terraces apparently developing and being used only later, during the 4th-7th centuries AD, after the 3rd-century collapse of long-distance trade.

The Nabateans controlled the trade on the spice route between their capital Petra and the Gazan seaports. Nabatean currency and the remains of red and orange potsherds, identified as a trademark of their civilisation, have been found along the route, remnants of which are also still visible. Nabatean control of the Negev ended when the Roman Empire annexed their lands in 106 AD. The population, largely comprising nomads, venerated deities such as Dushara, Allat, and others.

===Byzantine heydays: desert agriculture===
Byzantine rule in the 4th century introduced Christianity to the population. Agriculture-based cities were established and the population grew exponentially. As shown by the research conducted by Michael Evenari, novel techniques were employed, such as runoff rainwater collection and management systems, which harvested water from larger areas and directed it onto smaller plots. This permitted the cultivation of plants with much higher water requirements than the given arid environment could provide for. Evenari researched the ancient mechanisms, rediscovered the ratio of water collection area to cultivation area, and explained the various ancient techniques of land amelioration, such as wadi terracing and flash-flood dams, and the features used for collecting and directing runoff water. He thought that the creators of this elaborate systems had been the Nabataeans, a theory proved wrong by more recent studies, which dated the massive agricultural and demographic expansion in the area to the Byzantine period. The older explanation for the &quot;Tuleilat el-Anab&quot;, lit. &#x27;grape mounds&#x27; phenomenon, has also been discarded: these large piles of rocks probably served two purposes: removing the rocks from the cultivated plots and accelerating the erosion and water transportation of topsoil from the runoff collection area onto those plots.

Along with Avdat (Oboda), Mamshit (Mampsis), Shivta (Sobata), Haluza (Elusa), and Nitzana (Nessana), the settlements at Rehovot-in-the-Negev/Ruheibeh (the second largest by population of the Byzantine-era &quot;Negev towns&quot;) and Saadon are also significant for this period.

===Decline; causes===
A massive increase in grape production in the northwestern Negev for the requirements of the wine industry was noted for the early 6th century, documented by studying ancient refuse mounds at Shivta, Elusa and Nessana. There is a sharp peak in the presence of grape pips and broken &quot;Gaza jars&quot; used to export wine and other Levantine goods from the port of Gaza (see &quot;Gaza wine&quot;), after a slower increase during the fourth and fifth centuries, and followed in the mid-6th century by a sudden decrease. This was when two major calamities struck the Byzantine Empire and large parts of the world: the Late Antique Little Ice Age (536-545), caused by huge volcanic eruptions in the world, with the resulting extreme weather events of 535–536; and in the 540s the first outbreak of bubonic plague in the Old World, known as the Justinianic Plague. It seems likely that these two events resulted in a near-cessation of international trade with luxury goods such as Gaza wine, grape production in the Negev settlements again giving way to subsistence farming focusing on barley and wheat. Repeated earthquakes hit the region during the Byzantine period, with numerous revetment walls added to buildings to support them against collapse; a large 7th-century seismic event led to the abandonement of Avdat and Rehovot-in-the-Negev.

This recent analysis of newly-obtained data has proved the previously widely-accepted theory wrong, namely that the Muslim conquest, which occurred a century after these events, and specifically the Muslim ban on alcoholic beverages, was the cause of the decline of the wine industry in the Negev. In Nessana, the number of grape pips is even seen to increase again during the Early Islamic period, probably due to the needs of a local Christian monastery.

This disappearance of the wine industry from the semi-arid northern Negev shows that it was technically possible to sustain it over centuries, but that the grape monoculture was economically unsustainable in the long run due to its dependence on empire-wide trading networks, which required stability and prosperity over a vast territory.

===Early-mid Islamic empires===

The southern Negev saw a flourishing of economic activity during the 8th to 10th or 11th centuries. Six Islamic settlements have been found in the vicinity of modern Eilat, along with copper and gold mines and stone quarries, and a sophisticated irrigation system and road network. The economic centre was the port of Ayla (Aqaba).

===10th–19th century Bedouins===

Nomadic tribes ruled the Negev largely independently and with a relative lack of interference for the next thousand years. What is known of this time is largely derived from oral histories and folk tales of tribes from the Wadi Musa and Petra areas in present-day Jordan. The Bedouins of the Negev historically survived chiefly on sheep and goat husbandry. Scarcity of water and of permanent pastoral land required them to move constantly. The Bedouin in years past established few permanent settlements, although some were built, leaving behind remnants of stone houses called &#x27;baika.&#x27;

===Late Ottoman period (1900–1917)===
In 1900, the Ottoman Empire established an administrative centre for southern Syria at Beersheba including schools and a railway station. The authority of the tribal chiefs over the region was recognised by the Ottomans. A railway connected it to the port of Rafah. In 1914, the Ottoman authorities estimated the nomadic population at 55,000.

===British Mandate===
The 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement between Britain and France placed the Negev in Area B, &quot;Arab state or states&quot; under British patronage. The Negev was appropriated from the Ottoman army by British forces during 1917 and became part of Mandatory Palestine.

In 1922, the Bedouin component of the population was estimated at 72,898 out of a total of 75,254 for the Beersheba sub-district. The 1931 census estimated that the population of the Beersheba sub-district was 51,082. This large decrease was considered to be an artifact of incorrect enumeration methods used in 1922. An Arabic history of tribes around Beersheba, published in 1934 records 23 tribal groups.

===State of Israel===
Most of the Negev was earmarked by the November 1947 UN Partition Plan for the future Jewish state. During the 1947–49 War of Independence, Israel secured its sovereignty over the Negev. In the early years of the state, it absorbed many of the Jewish refugees from Arab countries, with the Israeli government setting up many development towns, such as Arad, Sderot and Netivot. Since then, the Negev has also become home to many of the Israel Defense Forces&#x27; major bases – a process accelerating in the past two decades.

==Demography==
With effect from 2010, the Negev was home to some 630,000 people, or 8.2% of Israel&#x27;s population, even though it comprises over 55% of the country&#x27;s area. 470,000 Negev residents (75% of the population) are Jews, while 160,000 or 25% are Bedouin. Of the Bedouin population (a demographic with a semi-nomadic tradition), 50% live in unrecognised villages, and 50% live in towns built for them by the Israeli government between the 1960s and 1980s; the largest of these is Rahat.
The population of the Negev is expected to reach 1.2 million by 2025. It was projected that the Beersheba metropolitan area would reach a population of 1 million by 2020, and Arad, Yeruham, and Dimona would triple in size by 2025.

==Bedouin==

A large part of the Negev Bedouins inhabit small communities or villages. Israel has refused to recognise certain Bedouin villages that were founded after the establishment of the state. Under Israel&#x27;s 2011-adopted and enacted Begin-Prawer plan – officially the Bill on the Arrangement of Bedouin Settlement in the Negev – some Bedouins are being moved to newly created townships. Bedouin villages established without proper sanction after establishment of the state are illegal under Israeli law. They are consequently destroyed or threatened with destruction. An Israeli court ruling in 2017 forced six residents to pay the cost of eight rounds of demolition to the state.

==Economy and housing==

===Development plans===
Blueprint Negev is a Jewish National Fund project introduced in 2005. The $600 million project is intended to attract 500,000 new Jewish residents to the Negev by improving transport infrastructure, establishing businesses, developing water resources and introducing programmes to protect the environment. A planned artificial desert river, swimming pools and golf courses raised concerns among environmentalists. Critics oppose those plans, calling instead for an inclusive plan for the green vitalisation of existing population centres, investment in Bedouin villages, a clean-up of toxic industries and development of job options for the unemployed.
A major Israel Defense Forces training base is being constructed in the Negev to accommodate 10,000 army personnel and 2,500 civilian staff. Three more bases will be built by 2020 as part of a plan to vacate land and buildings in Tel Aviv and central Israel, and bring jobs and investment to the south.

=== Solar power ===

The Negev Desert and the surrounding area, including the Arava Valley, are the sunniest parts of Israel and little of this land is arable, which is why it has become the centre of the Israeli solar industry. David Faiman, an expert on solar energy, is of the opinion that Israel&#x27;s future energy requirements could be met by building solar energy plants in the Negev. As director of Ben-Gurion National Solar Energy Center, he operates one of the largest solar dishes in the world. Technically, however, the Arava is a separate desert with its own unique climate and ecology.

A 250 MW solar park in Ashalim, an area in the northern Negev, the Ashalim Power Station, produces 121 Megawatts of power, using solar mirrors and thermal water heating. It is currently the largest in Israel.

The Rotem Industrial Complex outside of Dimona, Israel, has dozens of solar mirrors that focus the sun&#x27;s rays on a tower that in turn heats a water boiler to create steam, turning a turbine to create electricity. Luz II, Ltd., plans to use the solar array to test new technology for the three new solar plants to be built in California, USA for Pacific Gas and Electric Company.

===Wineries===
Vines have been planted in the Negev since ancient times. In modern times, vineyards have been established in the northern Negev hills using innovative computerised irrigation methods. Carmel Winery was the first of the major wineries to plant vineyards in the Negev and operates a boutique winery at Ramat Arad. Tishbi has vineyards at Sde Boker and Barkan grows its grapes in Mitzpe Ramon. Yatir Winery is a winery in Tel Arad. Its vineyards are on a hill 900 metres above sea level on the outskirts of Yatir Forest. Carmey Avdat is Israel&#x27;s first solar-powered winery.

==Environmental issues==

The Negev is home to hazardous infrastructures that include Negev Nuclear Research Center nuclear reactor, 22 agrochemical and petrochemical factories, an oil terminal, closed military zones, quarries, a toxic waste incinerator at Ne&#x27;ot Hovav, cell towers, a power plant, several airports, a prison, and two rivers of open sewage.

In 2005, the Tel Aviv municipality was accused of dumping waste in the Negev at the . The Manufacturers Association of Israel established an authority in 2005 to move 60 industrial enterprises active in the Tel Aviv region to the Negev.

In 1979, the Ramat Hovav toxic waste facility was established in Wadi el-Na&#x27;am because the area was perceived as invulnerable to leakage. However, within a decade, cracks were found in the rock beneath Ramat Hovav. In 2004, the Israeli Ministry of Health released Ben Gurion University research findings describing the health problems in a vicinity of Ramat Hovav. The study, funded in large part by Ramat Hovav, found higher rates of cancer and mortality for the 350,000 people in the area. Prematurely released to the media by an unknown source, the preliminary study was publicly discredited; However, its final conclusions – that Bedouin and Jewish residents near Ramat Hovav are significantly more susceptible than the rest of the population to miscarriages, severe birth defects, and respiratory diseases – passed a peer review several months later.

The film centers upon the efforts of the polymath Dr. Buckaroo Banzai, a physicist, neurosurgeon, test pilot, and rock star, to save the world by defeating a band of inter-dimensional aliens called Red Lectroids from Planet 10. The film is a cross between the action-adventure and science fiction film genres and also includes elements of comedy and romance.

After screenwriter W. D. Richter hired novelist Earl Mac Rauch to develop a screenplay of Mac Rauch&#x27;s new character, Buckaroo Banzai, Richter teamed with producer Neil Canton to pitch the script to MGM/UA studio chief David Begelman, who took it to 20th Century Fox to make the film. Box office figures were low and less than half of the film&#x27;s production costs were recovered. Some critics were put off by the complicated plot, although Pauline Kael enjoyed the film and Vincent Canby called it &quot;pure, nutty fun.&quot; &quot;Buckaroo Banzai&quot; has been adapted for books, comics, and a video game and has attracted a loyal cult following.

== Plot ==
Buckaroo Banzai and his mentor Dr. Tohichi Hikita perfect the &quot;oscillation overthruster&quot;, a device that allows an object to pass through solid matter. Banzai tests it by driving his Jet Car through a mountain. While in transit, he finds himself in another dimension. After exiting the mountain and returning to his normal dimension, he discovers an alien organism has attached itself to his car.

Dr. Emilio Lizardo, incarcerated at the Trenton Home for the Criminally Insane, sees a television news story of Banzai&#x27;s successful test. In 1938, Drs. Lizardo and Hikita had built a prototype overthruster in Princeton, New Jersey, but he tested it before it was ready and became stuck between dimensions. In those moments, he saw alien creatures and struggled until freed by his colleagues, emerging crazily changed and violent. Understanding that Banzai has finally accessed the 8th dimension, Lizardo escapes the asylum and plots to steal the overthruster.

Banzai and his band, &quot;The Hong Kong Cavaliers&quot;, are performing at a nightclub when Banzai interrupts their musical intro to speak to a sad woman in the audience, Penny Priddy. During a song he performs especially for her (&quot;Since I Don&#x27;t Have You&quot;), she attempts to shoot herself, which is mistaken for an assassination attempt on Banzai. After questioning her at the New Brunswick jail, he realizes she is his late wife Peggy&#x27;s long-lost identical twin sister and bails her out.

Later, during a press conference to discuss his Jet Car experience, the overthruster, and the specimen of alien/transdimensional life he obtained while traversing the 8th dimension, Banzai is called to the phone, where he receives an electrical shock. Simultaneously, strange men disrupt the event and kidnap Hikita. When Banzai returns, his electrical shock enables him to recognize them as humanoid aliens, and he gives chase. He rescues Hikita, and they manage to evade the aliens long enough for the Cavaliers to rescue them.

Banzai and the Cavaliers return to the Banzai Institute, where they are met by John Parker, a messenger from John Emdall, the leader of the peaceful Black Lectroids of Planet 10. Parker delivers a recording from Emdall in which she explains that her people have been at war with the hostile Red Lectroids for years, managing to banish them to the 8th dimension. Lizardo&#x27;s failed test of the overthruster in 1938 allowed the Red Lectroids&#x27; tyrannical leader, Lord John Whorfin, to take over Lizardo&#x27;s mind and enable several dozen of his allies to escape. Because Banzai has now perfected the overthruster, Emdall fears Whorfin and his allies will try to acquire it to free the other Red Lectroids and tasks Banzai with stopping Whorfin; otherwise, the Black Lectroids will attack Russia from their orbiting ship, triggering a nuclear World War III that will annihilate the Red Lectroids on Earth as well as humankind.

The Cavaliers track the Red Lectroids to Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems in New Jersey. They realize that Orson Welles&#x27;s broadcast of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; described the Lectroids&#x27; arrival in Grovers Mill, New Jersey in 1938, though afterward the Lectroids forced him to state it was fictional. Yoyodyne has been building a spacecraft to cross over to the 8th dimension, disguised as a new United States Air Force bomber. While the Cavaliers are planning their response, Red Lectroids break into the Institute and kidnap Penny, unaware that they have also captured the overthruster, which she was carrying.

At Yoyodyne, Penny refuses to tell the Red Lectroids where the overthruster is, and they begin torturing her. Banzai enters Yoyodyne headquarters alone; the Cavaliers follow, reinforced by several groups of the Blue Blaze Irregulars, civilians recruited to assist the Cavaliers when necessary. Banzai saves Penny and fights off the Red Lectroids, though she is wounded and unconscious. While the Cavaliers tend to her, Banzai and Parker sneak into a pod on the Yoyodyne spacecraft. Lacking Banzai&#x27;s overthruster, Whorfin insists they use his imperfect model, which fails to make the dimensional transition; instead, the Red Lectroid spaceship breaks through the Yoyodyne wall and takes off into the atmosphere.

Lord Whorfin ejects the pod containing Banzai and Parker from the craft, but they manage to activate it and use its weapon systems to destroy Whorfin and the other Red Lectroids. Banzai parachutes back to Earth while Parker returns to his people in orbit using the pod. With the situation resolved and war averted, Banzai finds Penny has died from her injuries. When he gives her a farewell kiss, Emdall allows Banzai one more brief moment of electricity, which revives Penny.

=== Development ===
In 1974, W.D. Richter&#x27;s wife read a review of &quot;Dirty Pictures from the Prom&quot;, the debut novel from Dartmouth College graduate and writer Earl Mac Rauch, and recommended it to her husband. Richter, also an alumnus from the college, read the book, loved it, and wrote Mac Rauch a letter. The two men began corresponding. When the writer told him about his interest in becoming a screenwriter, Richter offered him an open-ended invitation to visit him in Los Angeles where he was attending the University of Southern California and working as a script analyst for Warner Bros.

=== Screenplay ===
Years passed and Richter became a successful screenwriter. Mac Rauch took Richter up on his offer and arrived in L.A. Richter proceeded to introduce the writer to producer/director Irwin Winkler, who gave Mac Rauch rent money for the next six months. Over several dinners, Mac Rauch told Richter and his wife of a character named Buckaroo Bandy about whom he was thinking of writing a screenplay. Richter and his wife liked the idea and paid Mac Rauch $1,500 to develop and write it. According to Mac Rauch, his script was inspired by &quot;all those out-and-out, press-the-accelerator-to-the-floor, non-stop kung fu movies of the early &#x27;70s&quot;. Richter remembers that Mac Rauch wrote several stories about this character, then he &quot;would get thirty or forty pages into a script, abandon its storyline and write a new one&quot;. Mac Rauch recalled, &quot;It&#x27;s so easy to start something and then—since you&#x27;re really not as serious about it as you should be—end up writing half of it ... You shove the hundred pages in a drawer and try to forget about it. Over the years, I started a dozen &quot;Buckaroo&quot; scripts that ended that way.&quot;

Mac Rauch&#x27;s original 30-page treatment was titled &quot;Find the Jetcar, Said the President - A Buckaroo Banzai Thriller&quot;. Early on, one of the revisions Mac Rauch made was changing Buckaroo&#x27;s surname from Bandy to Banzai. Mac Rauch was not happy with the name change, but Richter convinced him to keep the new name. The Hong Kong Cavaliers also appeared in these early drafts, but, according to Richter, &quot;it never really went to a completed script. Mac wrote and wrote but never wrote the end&quot;. Another early draft was titled &quot;The Strange Case of Mr. Cigars&quot; about a huge robot and a box of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s cigars. Mac Rauch shelved his work for a few years while he wrote &quot;New York, New York&quot; for Martin Scorsese and other unproduced screenplays.

In 1980, Richter talked with producers Frank Marshall and Neil Canton about filming one of his screenplays. Out of this meeting, Canton and Richter formed their own production company and decided that &quot;Buckaroo Banzai&quot; would be the first film. Under their supervision, Mac Rauch wrote a 60-page treatment titled &quot;Lepers from Saturn&quot;. They shopped Mac Rauch&#x27;s treatment around to production executives who were their peers, proposing that Richter direct it, but no one wanted to take on such unusual subject matter by two first-time producers and a first-time director. Canton and Richter contacted veteran producer Sidney Beckerman at MGM/UA, with whom Canton had worked before. Beckerman liked the treatment and introduced Richter and Canton to studio chief David Begelman. Within 24 hours, they had a development deal with the studio. It took Mac Rauch a year and a half to write the final screenplay; during this time, the Lepers from the treatment became Lizards and then Lectroids—from Planet 10. Much of the film&#x27;s detailed character histories were taken from Mac Rauch&#x27;s unfinished &quot;Banzai&quot; scripts.

The 1981 Writers Guild of America strike forced the project to languish in development for more than a year. Begelman left MGM as several of his projects had performed poorly at the box office; this put all of his future projects, &quot;Buckaroo Banzai&quot; included, in jeopardy. Begelman formed Sherwood Productions and exercised a buy-out option with MGM for the &quot;Banzai&quot; script. He took it to 20th Century Fox who agreed to make it with a $12 million budget. Mac Rauch ended up writing three more drafts before they had a shooting script.

=== Casting ===
When considering the role of Buckaroo Banzai, Richter wanted an actor who &quot;could both look heroic with grease all over his face, and project the kind of intelligence you would associate with a neurosurgeon and inventor&quot;. The studio wanted a recognizable film star, but Richter and Canton wanted to cast a relatively unknown actor. Richter looked in New York City because he assumed that an actor with experience on stage and small films &quot;would be able to &quot;completely&quot; interact with props&quot;. He had been impressed by Peter Weller&#x27;s performance in &quot;Shoot the Moon&quot; and met with him. At first, the actor was hesitant to take the role because he was unclear on the overall tone of the film. &quot;Would it be campy? Would it be a cartoon? Or would it be the sort of wacky, realistic film that would catch people sideways—and not be a cartoon&quot;, Weller remembers thinking. Richter told Banzai&#x27;s story to Weller and convinced him to do the film. The actor stated that he based his character on Elia Kazan, Jacques Cousteau, Albert Einstein, Leonardo da Vinci, and Adam Ant.

For the role of Dr. Emilio Lizardo, the studio wanted to cast an unknown actor, but Mac Rauch had written the role with John Lithgow in mind. Like Weller, Lithgow was not sure about the character, but Richter convinced him by &quot;claiming what a real feast for an actor this wonderful Jekyll and Hyde character was&quot;, Lithgow later said. He told an interviewer, &quot;I have had roles where I came very close to going over the top. In &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; [in &quot;Nightmare at 20,000 Feet&quot;], I almost went over the top several times. But this role is completely over the top. It makes the role in &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; seem like a model of restraint. I do it in a wild, red fright wig and rotten false teeth with a thick Italian accent. It&#x27;s wild.&quot; For Lizardo&#x27;s accent, Lithgow spent time with an Italian tailor at MGM and recorded his voice (film credit to &quot;Roberto Terminelli: John Lithgow&#x27;s dialect coach&quot;). Lithgow changed his walk to that of an &quot;old crab, because my alien metabolism is supposed to be messed up&quot;. He said of his character, &quot;playing Lizardo felt like playing the madman in &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot;.&quot;

Ellen Barkin, who played the romantic interest &quot;Penny Priddy&quot;, describes the film as &quot;if Terry Southern had written &quot;Star Wars&quot;. None of the characters are quite what they should be—just my kind of thing.&quot; Richter&#x27;s only choice to play John Bigbooté was Christopher Lloyd, who agreed to the role. Richter first met Jeff Goldblum on &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; and wanted him to play the character New Jersey; the actor admired the script and was eager to work with the cast the director had assembled. Lewis Smith was asked to dye his hair blond; it took eight hours, and he saw it go from red to orange to fluorescent yellow to white. Clancy Brown said that his character is &quot;very common sensical. He&#x27;s the everyman of the film&quot;. Robert Ito was so determined to get the role of Dr. Hikita that he disguised himself as an old man, designing his own make-up job to age himself thirty years.

=== Pre-production ===
Production designer J. Michael Riva had worked with Richter before and spent two years working on the look for &quot;Banzai&quot;. He and Richter studied many kinds of art and literature for the film&#x27;s look, including medical journals, African magazines, and Russian history. The inspiration for the look of the Lectroids came from Riva sporting a lobster on his nose. He based the Lectroids&#x27; alien form on Canadian-American paleontologist Dale Russell&#x27;s &quot;dinosauroid&quot;, an extrapolation of what dinosaurs might have evolved into if they had survived, but modified the concept because it would have required prosthetics that would have immobilized the actors. Their makeup consisted of 12 separate pieces of latex appliances per alien. Each actor&#x27;s makeup was unique, with casts taken of their faces. For the Red Lectroids, Riva consulted Russian history to give them a &quot;baggy-suited, Moscow bureaucrat sort of image&quot;; their outfits were influenced by contemporary Russian lifestyles and they went with greens, blues and yellows because, according to Riva, they are &quot;sick and anemic.&quot;

Costume designer Aggie Guerard Rodgers, who designed costumes for &quot;Return of the Jedi,&quot; &quot;American Graffiti&quot; and &quot;The Conversation,&quot; met Richter while working on &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot;. Riva noted that &quot;She fell right into step with the stuff I was designing for the sets,&quot; making the costumes match the color of the rooms. Richter wanted the Black Lectroids to have a &quot;warrior-like demeanor, but in an elegant, not fierce fashion&quot;; their costumes came from African tribal markings. For Buckaroo&#x27;s and his Cavaliers&#x27; look, Rodgers gathered Gianni Versace, Perry Ellis, and Giorgio Armani sports jackets, suits, and ties. The clothing was mostly found in LA area stores. Rogers noted &quot;We also wanted to have something a little off so that there&#x27;s a kick to everything to make it unique. Rick changed something on every outfit&quot; and that &quot;It&#x27;s an interesting style, not a cliche style. You throw stuff in there that people will recognize.&quot; Goldblum&#x27;s character Dr. Zweibel was given a cowboy outfit to wear; according to costumer Radford Polinski, the character thought he was dressed appropriately for an audition for a person named &quot;Buckaroo&quot;. The outfit itself was from Nudie Cohn&#x27;s Rodeo Tailors.

Richter and Riva did not want metal spaceships and opted for a more organic look like a deep sea oyster shell. Gregory Jein, Inc. and Stetson Visual Concepts built the spaceship models and worked off sketches by production illustrator Tom Cranham and used seashells as guides. Richter purposely wanted the film to have an unpolished look because the &quot;real world appears ramshackle—because people constantly repair whatever&#x27;s around them&quot;.

=== Principal photography ===
By the time of filming, Richter had compiled a 300-page book called &quot;The Essential Buckaroo&quot; that consisted of notes and had every incomplete script Mac Rauch wrote over the years. These included various references to a villain named Hanoi Xan, leader of the World Crime League. Begelman was adamant that &quot;Across the 8th Dimension&quot; would be the one and only Buckaroo movie and that all references to Xan be removed. This included the removal of the original opening, which showed Buckaroo&#x27;s father being killed by Xan and featuring Jamie Lee Curtis as Buckaroo&#x27;s mother. The director later described Begelman as &quot;our enemy for the entire movie.&quot;

Principal photography began during the second week of September 1983 on locations in and around South Gate, an industrial suburb of L.A. Buckaroo&#x27;s neurosurgery scene with New Jersey was shot at the Lakeview Medical Center in the San Fernando Valley. The jet car sequences were shot in October on a dry lake north of the San Bernardino Mountains. The vehicle was designed and built by Riva, art director Stephen Dane, and Thrust Racing owners Jerry Segal and George Hedebeck. Segal started with a Ford F-350 truck, reinforced the frame assembly, added the front end from a Grand National stock car, borrowed air scoops from a DC-3, and a one-man cockpit modeled after a Messerschmitt fighter plane. Under the hood, Segal modified the Ford engine with an oversized carburetor and nitrous oxide injectors. Northrop University loaned the production a working GE turbojet engine. The oscillation overthruster was created by Riva and visual effects supervisor Michael Fink out of a gyroscope to which a metal frame, wires, circuits, and tiny strobe lights were added.

Cinematographer Jordan Cronenweth was initially hired as the film&#x27;s director of photography but, halfway through production, producers replaced him with Fred J. Koenekamp. Several scenes shot by Cronenweth, including the iconic nightclub scene, are included in the final cut, though Cronenweth goes uncredited.

The Banzai Institute exteriors were shot in Rustic Canyon, Los Angeles, with the interiors filmed in an Art Deco house designed in 1931 by MGM art director Cedric Gibbons for his wife, Dolores del Río. Deserted rooms at Brentwood&#x27;s V.A. hospital were used for Dr. Lizardo&#x27;s room at the Trenton Home for the Criminally Insane. Lizardo&#x27;s 1938 laboratory was filmed at a deserted industrial site, Alpha Tubing. The set decorators rented a collection of 1930s electrical props originally used in the original Boris Karloff Frankenstein films. The interiors of Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems were shot in the abandoned Firestone tire factory. Wilmington&#x27;s Department of Water and Power provided the location for Dr. Lizardo&#x27;s shock tower and served as the Yoyodyne exterior, while the Armco Steel Plant in Torrance housed the Lectroid launch hangar. Weller remembers that during the scene where his character is tortured by Dr. Lizardo, &quot;I was laughing at the banter between [Christopher] Lloyd and [John] Lithgow ... I never laughed so hard in my life! They had to stop takes over and over on that segment.&quot; Finally, 12 weeks of filming were done on the backlot and soundstages at MGM.

Begelman continually interfered with production through the initial stages of shooting, demanding changes and sending notes. By the end of filming, these demands had disappeared. The crew became convinced that Begelman had &quot;checked out&quot;, and to test their theory, added a now-famous scene in which the presence of a watermelon becomes a topic for a short discussion. When the scene was allowed into the movie without comment, they concluded that management was indeed ignoring them, and they had free rein to put in whatever they wanted.

Begelman eventually made one more major change after seeing that the movie ended with a kiss and demanding something more. By this time the budget was almost completely spent and postproduction nearly complete. Richter decided to have the end credits appear over a new scene that was shot in the style of a music video, hiring a choreographer to arrange the action over new music by Michael Boddicker. The song was not ready in time, so the crew filmed it while playing Billy Joel&#x27;s Uptown Girl. Richter described the scene as having &quot;kind of emerged from the end of the postproduction.&quot; The scene was shot with the actors walking in the LA River bed in front of the Sepulveda Dam. The scene, called &quot;gleefully bizarre&quot;, opens with the only remaining reference to the Hanoi Xan storyline when it mentions a (never produced) sequel called &quot;Buckaroo Banzai against the World Crime League.&quot;

=== Soundtrack ===
The film&#x27;s music coordinator and sound designer Bones Howe began working with musician Michael Boddicker on the film&#x27;s theme music and sound effects, as they had worked together on the soundtrack for &quot;Get Crazy&quot;. Boddicker was Howe&#x27;s first choice to write and perform the film&#x27;s score. Boddicker had just won a Grammy Award for his song &quot;Imagination&quot; on the &quot;Flashdance&quot; soundtrack. In addition to composing the score, Boddicker also produced the alien sound effects, while Alan Howarth was hired to create the sounds of the 8th Dimension.

Howe selected the source music for the club scene and put together a special arrangement of &quot;Since I Don&#x27;t Have You&quot; that Buckaroo sings to Penny Priddy. Weller, an accomplished musician, played the guitar and pocket trumpet, did his own vocals, and learned to mime piano playing. Howe and the filmmakers decided not to go with a rock music score for the film and opted for an electronic one instead. Howe wanted to &quot;integrate music and sound effects so that everything would merge on the soundtrack with no distinction between music and sound.&quot;

== Reception ==
=== Release ===
Fox hired Terry Erdmann and a team of publicists including Blake Mitchell and Jim Ferguson to promote the film at &quot;Star Trek&quot; conventions with a few film clips and free Banzai headbands, which have since become highly sought-after collector&#x27;s items by fans of the film. The studio made no attempts to sell the film to a mainstream audience with traditional promotion, although there were some magazine advertisements (primarily in Marvel Comics) and related licensing which served as viral advertising in limited venues. Studio publicist Rosemary LaSalmandra said, &quot;Nobody knew what to do with &quot;Buckaroo Banzai&quot;. There was no simple way to tell anyone what it was about—I&#x27;m not sure anybody knew&quot;. Lithgow said, &quot;I&#x27;ve tried to explain the story line to people and it takes about an hour. I mean it; it&#x27;s that complicated. But it&#x27;s terrific. Every time I tell people about it, I get so excited that I end it by saying, &quot;Buckaroo Banzai&quot;, remember where you heard it first!&quot;

&quot;Buckaroo Banzai&quot; was originally scheduled to be released on June 8, 1984 but was pushed back to August 10. It opened on 236 screens and faced stiff competition against the likes of &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; (also featuring &quot;Banzai&quot; co-star Christopher Lloyd), &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; and &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. It made US$620,279 on its opening weekend before finally grossing $6.2 million in North America, earning back less than half of its production costs.

=== Critical response ===
Although reportedly &quot;dismissed by many critics as &#x27;strange&#x27; and &#x27;unintelligible&#x27;&quot; at the time of its release, the film received positive reviews from of surveyed critics on Rotten Tomatoes. The critical consensus on Rotten Tomatoes reads, &quot;Sci-fi parodies like these usually struggle to work, but &quot;Buckaroo Banzai&quot; succeeds through total devotion to its own lunacy.&quot; Bill Cosford of &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; praised it as &quot;an unusual film&quot;: &quot;Its comedy springs from that odd combination of self-effacement and self-absorption [...] [It] is basically a comic strip, relentlessly hip [...] an adventure in the Buck Rogers mold.&quot; Dave Kehr, in the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, wrote, &quot;Richter seems to have invented an elaborate mythology for his hero [...] but he never bothers to explicate it; the film gives you the mildly annoying sensation of being left out of a not very good private joke&quot;. Danny Peary&#x27;s 1986 &quot;Guide for the Film Fanatic&quot; described &quot;Buckaroo Banzai&quot; as a &quot;scatterbrained, sloppily made science-fiction comedy for the stoned-out generation [...] a surprising failure when hip audiences were turned off by [the] conceited attempt by filmmakers and actors to show off how hip they were.&quot; In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby wrote that &quot;Buckaroo Banzai&quot; &quot;may well turn out to be a pilot film for other theatrical features, though this one would be hard to top for pure, nutty fun&quot;. Richard Corliss, for &quot;Time&quot;, wrote, &quot;its creators, Earl Mac Rauch and W.D. Richter, propel their film with such pace and farfetched style that anyone without PhDs in astrophysics and pop culture is likely to get lost in the ganglion of story strands. One wonders if the movie is too ambitious, facetious and hip for its own box-office good&quot;. &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, film critic Pauline Kael wrote, &quot;I didn&#x27;t find it hard to accept the uninflected, deadpan tone, and to enjoy &quot;Buckaroo Banzai&quot; for its inventiveness and the gags that bounce off other adventure movies, other comedies. The picture&#x27;s sense of fun carried me along&quot;.

Danny Bowes, writing a retrospective in 2011 for Tor.com, said that the film &quot;is paradoxically decades ahead of its time and yet completely &quot;of&quot; its time; it&#x27;s profoundly a movie by, for, and of geeks and nerds at a time before geek/nerd culture was mainstreamed, and a movie whose pre-CG special effects and pre-Computer Age production design were an essential part of its good-natured enthusiasm. What at the time was a hip, modern take on classic SF is now [...] almost indistinguishable from the SF cinema that inspired it in terms of the appeal to modern viewers: the charmingly old-fashioned special effects, and the comparatively innocent earnestness of its tone.&quot;

=== Home media ===
&quot;Buckaroo Banzai&quot; was first released for home media on LaserDisc, VHS and Betamax in 1985 by Vestron Video, in 1990 by Video Treasures, and in 2001 by MGM Home Entertainment. The film was released on DVD on January 4, 2002 by MGM Home Entertainment. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the DVD release a &quot;B+&quot; rating and wrote, &quot;Fans will drool over the extras, including some illuminating deleted scenes (of particular note is an alternate opening detailing Buckaroo&#x27;s tragic childhood, featuring Jamie Lee Curtis as Banzai&#x27;s mother) and director Richter&#x27;s commentary, which reveals some colorful behind-the-scenes battles with studio execs.&quot; IGN gave the DVD their highest rating and was &quot;thrilled by the special edition treatment that this landmark cult film has received at the hands of MGM. The video is great, the sound is great, there are tons of extras&quot;. For the Blu-ray format, the film was featured as part of Shout! Factory&#x27;s Shout! Select Blu-ray line in August 2016; the Shout! Factory release contains a two-hour retrospective documentary featuring interviews with Weller, Lithgow, Brown, Serna, Smith, Vera, Lloyd and director W.D. Richter, among others. A Blu-ray was also released in the United Kingdom by Arrow Video in 2015.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Buckaroo Banzai&quot; has since attracted a loyal cult following and has been popular on home video. Richter said, &quot;It has had the most dramatic reactions of anything I&#x27;ve worked on. Some loathe it and others are willing to die for it&quot;. The director feels that the film failed commercially because the narrative was too complex; he would have liked to have had more coverage for certain scenes and felt he could have edited the film better, as there were too many master shots and two-shots that left little for the editor to work with.

&quot;Wired Magazine&quot;, in 2009, celebrated &quot;the 25th anniversary of the release of a film near and dear to many geeks who came of age in the &#x27;80s. &quot;The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension&quot; was a great, adventurous, geeky movie, with enough silly science fiction and great characters to fill any three lousy summer blockbusters these days ... and it gave us so many great, geeky lines to quote.&quot; Bill Cosford, in his 1984 &quot;Miami Herald&quot; review, had foreseen the dialogue&#x27;s popularity: &quot;I suspect that Buckaroo&#x27;s odd musings, particularly the one about being there no matter where you go, are about to enter the popular argot on the scale of &quot;Where&#x27;s the beef?&quot;; his prediction has been proved right. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked &quot;Buckaroo Banzai&quot; as No. 43 in their Top 50 Cult Movies. The film was also ranked No. 21 on the magazine&#x27;s &quot;The Cult 25: The Essential Left-Field Movie Hits Since &#x27;83&quot; list. &quot;The Guardian&quot; has also cited &quot;Buckaroo Banzai&quot; as one of their &quot;1,000 films to see before you die&quot;.

== Other media ==
=== Books ===
The film was novelized by creator Earl Mac Rauch in 1984. The book was titled &quot;Buckaroo Banzai&quot;, published by Pocket Books and released in conjunction with the film. It was reprinted in 2002 to coincide with the release of the film on DVD. In the foreword, Mac Rauch mentions that the Buckaroo Banzai series would be continued in a series of novels.

The second book in the series, &quot;The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Against the World Crime League, et al: A Compendium of Evils&quot;, also authored by Earl Mac Rauch, was published by Dark Horse in November 2021. Both novels are written in the first person point of view from Reno&#x27;s perspective.

=== Comics ===
Also in conjunction with the film&#x27;s 1984 release, Marvel Comics published a comic book adaptation by writer Bill Mantlo and artists Mark Texeira in &quot;Marvel Super Special&quot; No. 33. The adaptation was also released as a two-issue limited series.

Moonstone Books began publishing comic books in 2006 depicting earlier and further adventures of Buckaroo Banzai and the Hong Kong Cavaliers. The first story, &quot;Buckaroo Banzai: Return of the Screw&quot;, was written by creator Earl Mac Rauch. The black-and-white preview edition of the comic was released in February 2006, featuring a behind-the-scenes article by Dan Berger regarding the transformation of the rejected Buckaroo Banzai television pilot script &quot;Supersize those Fries&quot; into the present comic book limited series. The three issues of this comic have been collected into a trade paperback. In December 2007, Moonstone released a new Banzai comic story &quot;A Christmas Corrall&quot; in the &quot;Moonstone Holiday Super Spectacular&quot; compilation, also written by Mac Rauch and drawn by Ken Wolak. A two-issue prequel to the film was released in early 2008 called &quot;Of Hunan Bondage&quot;. It was written by Mac Rauch with art by &quot;Superman Returns&quot; storyboard artist Chewie. Moonstone released &quot;Big Size&quot; in early 2009, a special oversize one-shot comic written by Mac Rauch with art by Paul Hanley.

=== Video game ===
In conjunction with the film&#x27;s 1984 release, the interactive fiction game &quot;The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai: Across the 8th Dimension&quot; was released for the Apple II, Atari 8-bit computers, Commodore 16, Commodore Plus/4, Commodore 64, IBM PC compatibles, and ZX Spectrum. It was created by Scott Adams and published by Adventure International.

=== Television series ===
In late 1998, the Fox Network announced development of a &quot;Buckaroo Banzai&quot; TV series titled &quot;Buckaroo Banzai: Ancient Secrets and New Mysteries&quot;, but it was never released. The special edition DVD contains a short computer-animated sequence by Foundation Imaging made as a test reel for the series. The clip depicts a Space Shuttle trying to land with broken landing gear; Dr. Banzai maneuvers his Jet Car under the Shuttle and uses it to take the place of the broken gear.

In May 2016, Kevin Smith announced he would be adapting the film for television through MGM Television. Amazon Studios indicated a deal was being negotiated to produce the series. However, by November, during a Facebook Live Stream, Smith revealed that he would be walking away from the project after MGM filed a lawsuit against the original creators.

=== Other references ===
The film has been seen in other media. The 1987 instructional book &quot;The Hitchhikers Guide to the Internet&quot; made frequent use of &quot;Yoyodyne&quot; in its examples of corporate URLs. Yoyodyne had earlier been featured as the name of an aerospace company in two 1960s novels by Thomas Pynchon. The ending scene of the movie, in which Banzai and an ever-growing group of his friends and associates walk together triumphantly while the closing credits roll, was copied for the ending of the 2004 film &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot;. (Jeff Goldblum appears in both scenes.) The current incarnation of the comic strip &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; has seen two subtle references to the film in the storyline. In a strip dated October 22, 2013, there is a reference to a business named &quot;Emilio Lizardo Crematorium&quot;. In a strip dated November 7, 2013, Dick Tracy&#x27;s granddaughter Honeymoon tells him she will be attending a Hong Kong Cavaliers concert with the hope of getting Perfect Tommy&#x27;s autograph. Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems had an office on the promenade of &quot;Star Trek&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. The PhD thesis of Eric Weinstein was called &quot;Extension of Self-Dual Yang-Mills Equations Across the Eighth Dimension&quot;. Parzival, the main character of the film &quot;Ready Player One&quot;, appears in a Buckaroo Banzai costume for a date. Aech says to Parzival, &quot;You&#x27;re going to wear the outfit from your favorite movie.&quot; His date Art3mis responds to his costume with, &quot;I like Buckaroo Banzai!&quot;

<text>Alnwick Castle () is a castle and country house in Alnwick in the English county of Northumberland. It is the seat of the 12th Duke of Northumberland, built following the Norman conquest and renovated and remodelled a number of times. It is a Grade I listed building now the home of Ralph Percy, 12th Duke of Northumberland and his family. In 2016, the castle received over 600,000 visitors per year when combined with adjacent attraction the Alnwick Garden.

==History==

Alnwick Castle guards a road crossing the River Aln. Ivo de Vesci, Baron of Alnwick, a nobleman from Vassy, Calvados in Normandy, erected the first parts of the castle in about 1096. Beatrix de Vesci, the daughter of Yves de Vescy, married the Constable of Chestershire and Knaresborough, Eustace fitz John. By his marriage to Beatrix de Vesci he gained the baronies of Malton and Alnwick. The castle was first mentioned in 1136 when it was captured by King David I of Scotland. At this point it was described as &quot;very strong&quot;. It was besieged in 1172 and again in 1174 by William the Lion, King of Scotland. William was captured outside the walls during the Battle of Alnwick. Eustace de Vesci, lord of Alnwick, was accused of plotting with Robert Fitzwalter against King John in 1212. In response, John ordered the demolition of Alnwick Castle and of Fitzwalter&#x27;s stronghold, Baynard&#x27;s Castle, though his instructions were not carried out at Alnwick.

A descendant of Ivo de Vesci, John de Vesci, succeeded to his father&#x27;s titles and estates upon the latter&#x27;s death in Gascony in 1253. These included the barony of Alnwick and a large property in Northumberland and considerable estates in Yorkshire, including Malton. As John was underage, King Henry III of England conferred the wardship of his estates to a foreign kinsman, which caused great offence to the de Vesci family. The family&#x27;s property and estates had been put into the guardianship of Antony Bek, who sold them to the Percys. From this time the fortunes of the Percys, though they still held their Yorkshire lands and titles, were linked permanently with Alnwick and its castle and have been owned by the Percy family, the earls and later dukes of Northumberland since. The stone castle Henry Percy bought was a modest affair, but he immediately began rebuilding. Though he did not live to see its completion, the construction programme turned Alnwick into a major fortress along the Anglo-Scottish border. His son, also called Henry (1299–1352), continued the building. The Abbot&#x27;s Tower, the Middle Gateway and the Constable&#x27;s Tower survive from this period. The work at Alnwick Castle balanced military requirements with the family&#x27;s residential needs. It set the template for castle renovations in the 14th century in northern England; several palace-fortresses, considered &quot;extensive, opulent [and] theatrical&quot; date from this period in the region, such as the castles of Bamburgh and Raby. In 1345 the Percys acquired Warkworth Castle, also in Northumberland. Though Alnwick was considered more prestigious, Warkworth became the family&#x27;s preferred residence.

The Percy family were powerful lords in northern England. Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland (1341–1408), rebelled against King Richard II and helped dethrone him. The earl and his son Harry Hotspur later rebelled against King Henry IV and after defeating Hotspur in the Battle of Shrewsbury, the king pursued the earl. The castle surrendered under the threat of bombardment in 1403.
During the Wars of the Roses, castles were infrequently attacked and conflict was generally based around combat in the field. Alnwick was one of three castles held by Lancastrian forces in 1461 and 1462, and it was there that the &quot;only practical defence of a private castle&quot; was made according to military historian D. J. Cathcart King. It was held against King Edward IV until its surrender in mid-September 1461 after the Battle of Towton. Re-captured by the Lancastrian Sir William Tailboys, during the winter it was surrendered by him to Hastings, Sir John Howard and Sir Ralph Grey of Heton in late July 1462. Grey was appointed captain but surrendered to the Lancastrians after a sharp siege in the early autumn. King Edward responded with vigour and when the Earl of Warwick arrived in November Queen Margaret and her French advisor, Pierre de Brézé, were forced to sail to Scotland for help. They organised a mainly Scots relief force which, under George Douglas, 4th Earl of Angus and de Brézé, set out on 22 November. Warwick&#x27;s army, commanded by the experienced Earl of Kent and the recently pardoned Lord Scales, prevented news getting through to the starving garrisons. As a result, the nearby Bamburgh and Dunstanburgh castles soon agreed terms and surrendered but Hungerford and Whittingham held Alnwick until Warwick was forced to withdraw when de Brézé and Angus arrived on 5 January 1463.

The Lancastrians missed a chance to bring Warwick to battle, instead being content to retire, leaving behind only a token force which surrendered to the Yorkists the next day. By May 1463 Alnwick was in Lancastrian hands for the third time since Towton, betrayed by Grey of Heton who tricked the commander, Sir John Astley. Astley was imprisoned and Hungerford resumed command. After Montagu&#x27;s triumphs at Hedgeley Moor and Hexham in 1464 Warwick arrived before Alnwick on 23 June and received its surrender next day, bringing it finally into Yorkist hands. By the following decade, the 4th Earl of Northumberland had pledged fealty to Edward IV and the castle was returned to the Percys.

After the execution of Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland, in 1572 Alnwick Castle was increasingly uninhabited. The 9th Earl of Northumberland placed his distant cousin, another Thomas, in charge as constable in 1594, but just over a decade later Thomas was killed fleeing the Gunpowder Plot and the earl was imprisoned in the Tower of London, beginning over a century without a significant Percy presence at Alnwick. In 1650, Oliver Cromwell would use the castle to house prisoners following the Battle of Dunbar.

In the second half of the 18th century Robert Adam carried out many alterations, as did James Paine, Daniel Garrett and Capability Brown, all under the orders of the returning Percy family. Elizabeth Seymour and Hugh Smithson were elevated to 1st Duke and Duchess of Northumberland in 1766 by George III, whose restorations at Windsor Castle were partly inspired by the couple&#x27;s work at Alnwick. The interiors were largely in a Strawberry Hill gothic style not at all typical of Adam&#x27;s work, which was usually neoclassical, as seen at the Northumberlands&#x27; London home, Syon House.

However, in the 19th century Algernon, 4th Duke of Northumberland replaced much of Adam&#x27;s architecture. Instead, he paid Anthony Salvin £250,000 between 1854 and 1865 to remove the recent additions and remodel the castle in a more convincingly medieval style. Salvin is mostly responsible for the kitchen, the Prudhoe Tower, the palatial accommodation and the layout of the inner ward. Some of Adam&#x27;s work survives, but little of it remains in the principal rooms shown to the public, which were redecorated in an opulent Italianate style in the Victorian era by Luigi Canina.

==Current use==
The current duke and his family live in the castle, but occupy only a part of it. The castle is open to the public throughout the summer. After Windsor Castle, it is the second largest inhabited castle in England. Alnwick is the tenth-most-visited stately home in England according to the Historic Houses Association, with 195,504 visitors in 2006. This figure has increased significantly in the subsequent decade.

During World War II, the Newcastle Church High School for Girls was evacuated to Alnwick Castle. Since the war parts of the castle have continued being used by two other educational establishments: from 1945 to 1977, as Alnwick College of Education, a teacher training college; and, since 1981, by St. Cloud State University of Minnesota as a branch campus forming part of their International Study Programme.

Special exhibitions are housed in three of the castle&#x27;s perimeter towers. The Postern Tower, as well as featuring an exhibition on the Dukes of Northumberland and their interest in archaeology, includes frescoes from Pompeii, relics from Ancient Egypt and Romano-British objects. Constable&#x27;s Tower houses military displays like the Percy Tenantry Volunteers exhibition, local volunteer soldiers raised to repel Napoleon&#x27;s planned invasion in the period 1798–1814. The Abbot&#x27;s Tower houses the Regimental Museum of the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers.

An increase in public interest in the castle was generated by its use as a stand-in for the exterior and interior of Hogwarts in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films. Its appearance in the films has helped shape the public imagination regarding what castles should look like. Its condition contrasts with the vast majority of castles in the country, which are ruinous and unfit for habitation.

==Construction==

The River Aln flows past the north side of the Castle. There is a deep ravine to the south and east, separating the castle from the town. By the 12th century, Alnwick Castle had assumed the general layout which it retains today. It is distinguished as one of the earliest castles in England to be built without a square keep. The castle consists of two main rings of buildings. The principal rooms are in the much-rebuilt shell keep at the centre of the castle. The keep is entered through an elaborate Romanesque archway between two semi-octagonal towers added in the 14th century to better defend the gate. Unlike most shell keeps, which consist of a plain circular wall, Alnwick&#x27;s is created by ten tightly-packed towers, thanks to its extensive later reconstruction. Of these towers, two flank the gate, three more are 14th century, and the remainder are the work of Salvin. Within the keep, the arches over the well and the gateway are medieval, while the rest is Salvin&#x27;s. He added the large Prudhoe Tower with a loggia at the ground level in the north-west corner of the small courtyard inside the keep.

This structure is at the centre of a large bailey. As the central block was not large enough to contain all the accommodations required in later centuries, a large range of buildings was constructed along the south wall of the bailey. These two main areas of accommodation are connected by a link building. There are ten main towers along the walls of the outer bailey. Running clockwise from the keep, they are the Postern Tower, the Constable&#x27;s Tower, the Record Tower, the Warder&#x27;s Tower, the middle gatehouse, the Auditor&#x27;s Tower, the Clock Tower, the main gatehouse, the Abbot&#x27;s Tower and the Falconer&#x27;s Tower. Some of the towers are D-shaped, for better resistance to assault, while some are rectangular, to provide better accommodation. Most of the towers are part of the 14th century work, though the Constable&#x27;s, Warder&#x27;s, Clock and Falconer&#x27;s Towers have been rebuilt. There are also three smaller turrets: Hotspur&#x27;s Chair on the east side, named after Harry Hotspur, and the West Garret and Aveners&#x27; Towers either side of the main gatehouse. The main gate is defended by two semi-octagonal towers, like the inner gate, with a long barbican in front. About a sixth of the bailey wall has been reduced almost to ground level on the bailey side to open up views into the park. Where the outer wall formerly joined the keep, a lower terrace was added as part of the Georgian works. Stable and service yards adjoin the castle outside the bailey; these would not have existed when the castle still had a military function.

Alnwick Castle has two parks. Immediately to the north of the castle is a relatively small park straddling the River Aln which was landscaped by Lancelot Brown (&quot;Capability Brown&quot;) and Thomas Call in the 18th century; it is known locally as the Pastures. Nearby is the much larger Hulne Park, which contains the remains of Hulne Priory.

The castle is in good repair and used for many purposes. It provides a home for the present Duke and family and offices for Northumberland Estates, which manages the Duke&#x27;s extensive farming and property holdings.

Alnwick&#x27;s battlements are surmounted by carved figures. Some of these date from around 1300; historian Matthew Johnson notes that around this time there were several castles in northern England similarly decorated, such as Bothal, Lumley and Raby. However, many of the surviving figures are from the mid-18th century, commissioned by the 1st Duke and Duchess from Stamfordham sculptor James Johnson.

==Alnwick Garden==

Adjacent to the castle, Jane Percy, Duchess of Northumberland, initiated the establishment of the Alnwick Garden, a formal garden set around a cascading fountain. It cost £42 million (press release of 7 August 2003). The garden belongs to a charitable trust which is separate from the Northumberland Estates, but the Duke of Northumberland donated the site and £9 million. The garden is designed by Jacques Wirtz and Peter Wirtz of Wirtz International based in Schoten, Belgium. The first phase of development opened in October 2001, involved the creation of the fountain and initial planting of the gardens. In 2004 a large &#x27;treehouse&#x27; complex, including a café, was opened. It is deemed one of the largest treehouses in the world.

In February 2005, a poison garden, growing plants such as cannabis and opium poppy, was added. May 2006 saw the opening of a pavilion and visitor centre designed by Sir Michael Hopkins and Buro Happold which can hold up to 1,000 people.

== Filming location ==
Alnwick Castle has frequently been used as a location for filming. Films shot at the castle include: &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; (1954); &quot;Becket&quot; (1964); &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; (1971); &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1982); &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; (1991); &quot;Elizabeth&quot; (1998); &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001); &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; (2002); &quot;Your Highness&quot; (2011); &quot;&quot; (2017) and &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honour Among Thieves&quot; (2023). Television programmes shot at the castle include: &quot;The Black Adder&quot; (1983); &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; (1984-6); &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; (1995); &quot;The Virgin Queen&quot; (2005); &quot;The Hollow Crown&quot; (2012) and &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; (2015-6).

<doc id="142280" wikidata="Q151624" url="?curid=142280" title="German Confederation">
<text>The German Confederation ( ) was an association of 39 predominantly German-speaking sovereign states in Central Europe. It was created by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 as a replacement of the former Holy Roman Empire, which had been dissolved in 1806 as a result of the Napoleonic Wars.

The Confederation had only one organ, the &quot;Bundesversammlung&quot;, or Federal Convention (also Federal Assembly or Confederate Diet). The Convention consisted of the representatives of the member states. The most important issues had to be decided on unanimously. The Convention was presided over by the representative of Austria. This was a formality, however, as the Confederation did not have a head of state, since it was not a state.

The Confederation, on the one hand, was a strong alliance between its member states because federal law was superior to state law (the decisions of the Federal Convention were binding for the member states). Additionally, the Confederation had been established for eternity and was impossible to dissolve (legally), with no member states being able to leave it and no new member being able to join without universal consent in the Federal Convention. On the other hand, the Confederation was weakened by its very structure and member states, partly because the most important decisions in the Federal Convention required unanimity and the purpose of the Confederation was limited to only security matters. On top of that, the functioning of the Confederation depended on the cooperation of the two most populous member states, Austria and Prussia which in reality were often in opposition.

The German revolutions of 1848–1849, motivated by liberal, democratic, socialist, and nationalist sentiments, attempted to transform the Confederation into a unified German federal state with a liberal constitution (usually called the Frankfurt Constitution in English). The Federal Convention was dissolved on 12 July 1848, but was re-established in 1850 after the revolution was crushed by Austria, Prussia, and other states.

The Confederation was finally dissolved after the victory of the Kingdom of Prussia in the Seven Weeks&#x27; War over the Austrian Empire in 1866. The dispute over which had the inherent right to rule German lands ended in favour of Prussia, leading to the creation of the North German Confederation under Prussian leadership in 1867, to which the eastern portions of the Kingdom of Prussia were added. A number of South German states remained independent until they joined the North German Confederation, which was renamed and proclaimed as the &quot;German Empire&quot; in 1871, as the unified Germany (aside from Austria) with the Prussian king as emperor (Kaiser) after the victory over French Emperor Napoleon III in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870.
Most historians have judged the Confederation to have been weak and ineffective, as well as an obstacle to the creation of a German nation-state. This weakness was part of its design, as the European Great Powers, including Prussia and especially Austria, did not want it to become a nation-state. However, the Confederation was not a &#x27;loose&#x27; tie between the German states, as it was impossible to leave the Confederation, and as Confederation law stood above the law of the aligned states. The constitutional weakness of the Confederation lay in the principle of unanimity in the Diet and the limits of the Confederation&#x27;s scope: it was essentially a military alliance to defend Germany against external attacks and internal riots. Ironically, the War of 1866 proved its ineffectiveness, as it was unable to combine the federal troops in order to fight the Prussian secession.

==History==

===Background===

The War of the Third Coalition lasted from about 1803 to 1806. Following defeat at the Battle of by the French under Napoleon in December 1805, Francis II abdicated as Holy Roman Emperor on 6 August 1806, thus dissolving the Empire. In the aftermath of the Treaty of Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine in July 1806, joining sixteen of France&#x27;s allies among the German states (including Bavaria and ). After the Battle of of October 1806 in the War of the Fourth Coalition, various other German states, including Saxony and Westphalia, also joined the Confederation. Only Austria, Prussia, Danish , Swedish Pomerania, and the French-occupied Principality of Erfurt stayed outside the Confederation of the Rhine. The War of the Sixth Coalition from 1812 to winter 1814 saw the defeat of Napoleon and the liberation of Germany. In June 1814, the famous German patriot Heinrich vom Stein created the Central Managing Authority for Germany (&quot;Zentralverwaltungsbehörde&quot;) in Frankfurt to replace the defunct Confederation of the Rhine. However, plenipotentiaries gathered at the Congress of Vienna were determined to create a weaker union of German states than that envisaged by Stein.

===Establishment===
The German Confederation was created by the of the Congress of Vienna on 8 June 1815 after being alluded to in of the 1814 Treaty of Paris, ending the War of the Sixth Coalition.

The Confederation was formally created by a second treaty, the &quot;Final Act of the Ministerial Conference to Complete and Consolidate the Organization of the German Confederation&quot;. This treaty was not concluded and signed by the parties until 15 May 1820. States joined the German Confederation by becoming parties to the second treaty. The states designated for inclusion in the Confederation were:

In 1839, as compensation for the loss of part of the province of to Belgium, the Duchy of Limburg was created and became a member of the German Confederation (held by the Netherlands jointly with Luxembourg) until the dissolution of 1866. In 1867 the duchy was declared to be an &quot;integral part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands&quot;. The cities of Maastricht and Venlo were not included in the Confederation.

The Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia were the largest and by far the most powerful members of the Confederation. Large parts of both countries were not included in the Confederation, because they had not been part of the former Holy Roman Empire, nor were the greater parts of their armed forces incorporated in the federal army. Austria and Prussia each had one vote in the Federal Assembly.

Six other major states had one vote each in the Federal Assembly: the Kingdom of Bavaria, the Kingdom of Saxony, the Kingdom of, the Electorate of Hesse, the Grand Duchy of Baden, and the Grand Duchy of Hesse.

Three foreign monarchs ruled member states: the King of Denmark as Duke of Holstein and Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg; the King of the Netherlands as Grand Duke of Luxembourg and (from 1839) Duke of Limburg; and the King of the United Kingdom (until 1837) as King of Hanover were members of the German Confederation. Each of them had a vote in the Federal Assembly. At its foundation in 1815, four member states were ruled by foreign monarchs, as the King of Denmark was Duke of both Holstein and Saxe-Lauenburg.

The four free cities of , , , and shared one vote in the Federal Assembly.

The 23 remaining states (at its formation in 1815) shared five votes in the Federal Assembly:

* Saxe-Weimar, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and Saxe-Hildburghausen (5 states)
* Brunswick and Nassau (2 states)
* Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz (2 states)
* Oldenburg, Anhalt-Dessau, Anhalt-Bernburg, Anhalt-Köthen, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and Schwarzburg-Sondershausen (6 states)
* Hohenzollern-Hechingen, Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, Liechtenstein, Reuss (Elder Branch), Reuss (Younger Branch), Schaumburg-Lippe, Lippe and Waldeck (8 states)

There were therefore 17 votes in the Federal Assembly.

== Military ==
=== Activities ===
The rules of the Confederation provided for three different types of military interventions:
* the federal war (&quot;Bundeskrieg&quot;) against an external enemy who attacks federal territory,
* the federal execution (&quot;Bundesexekution&quot;) against the government of a member state that violates federal law,
* the federal intervention (&quot;Bundesintervention&quot;) supporting a government that is under pressure of a popular uprising.
Other military conflicts were foreign to the confederation (&quot;bundesfremd&quot;). An example is Austria&#x27;s oppression of the uprising in Northern Italy in 1848 and 1849, as these Austrian territories lay outside of the confederation&#x27;s borders.

During the existence of the Confederation, there was only one federal war: the war against Denmark beginning with the Schleswig-Holstein uprising in 1848 (the First Schleswig War). The conflict became a federal war when the Bundestag demanded from Denmark to withdraw its troops from Schleswig (April 12) and recognized the revolutionary of Schleswig-Holstein (April 22). The confederation was transformed into the German Empire of 1848. Prussia was &quot;de facto&quot; the most important member state conducting the war for Germany.

There are several examples for federal executions and especially federal interventions. In 1863, the Confederation ordered a federal execution against the duke of Holstein (the Danish king). Federal troops occupied Holstein which was a member state. After this, Austria and Prussia declared war on Denmark, the Second Schleswig War (or &quot;Deutsch-Dänischer Krieg&quot; in German). As Schleswig and Denmark were not member states, this war was foreign to the Confederation. The Confederation took no part in this war.

A federal intervention confronted for example the raid of the revolutionaries in Baden in April 1848.

In June 1866, the Federal Convention decided to takes measures against Prussia. This decision was technically not a federal execution for a lack of time to observe the actual procedure. Prussia had violated, according to the majority of the convention, federal law by sending its troops to Holstein. The decision led to the war in summer 1866 that ended with the dissolution of the confederation (known as &quot;Seven Weeks War&quot; or by other names).

===Armed forces===
The German Federal Army (&quot;Deutsches Bundesheer&quot;) was supposed to collectively defend the German Confederation from external enemies, primarily France. Successive laws passed by the Confederate Diet set the form and function of the army, as well as contribution limits of the member states. The Diet had the power to declare war and was responsible for appointing a supreme commander of the army and commanders of the individual army corps. This made mobilization extremely slow and added a political dimension to the army. In addition, the Diet oversaw the construction and maintenance of several German Federal Fortresses and collected funds annually from the member states for this purpose.

Projections of army strength were published in 1835, but the work of forming the Army Corps did not commence until 1840 as a consequence of the Rhine Crisis. Money for the fortresses were determined by an act of the Confederate Diet in that year. By 1846, Luxemburg still had not formed its own contingent, and Prussia was rebuffed for offering to supply 1,450 men to garrison the Luxemburg fortress that should have been supplied by Waldeck and the two Lippes. In that same year, it was decided that a common symbol for the Federal Army should be the old Imperial two-headed eagle, but without crown, scepter, or sword, as any of those devices encroached on the individual sovereignty of the states. King Frederick William IV of Prussia was among those who derided the &quot;disarmed imperial eagle&quot; as a national symbol.

The German Federal Army was divided into ten Army Corps (later expanded to include a Reserve Corps). However, the Army Corps were not exclusive to the German Confederation but composed from the national armies of the member states, and did not include all of the armed forces of a state. For example, Prussia&#x27;s army consisted of nine Army Corps but contributed only three to the German Federal Army.

The strength of the mobilized German Federal Army was projected to total 303,484 men in 1835 and 391,634 men in 1860, with the individual states providing the following figures:
; Notes
==Historical context==
Between 1806 and 1815, Napoleon organized the German states, aside from Prussia and Austria, into the Confederation of the Rhine, but this collapsed after his defeats in 1812 to 1815. The German Confederation had roughly the same boundaries as the Empire at the time of the French Revolution (less what is now Belgium). It also kept intact most of Confederation&#x27;s reconstituted member states and their boundaries. The member states, drastically reduced to 39 from more than 300 (see ) under the Holy Roman Empire, were recognized as fully sovereign. The members pledged themselves to mutual defense, and joint maintenance of the fortresses at Mainz, the city of Luxembourg, , , and .

The only organ of the Confederation was the Federal Assembly (officially , often called ), which consisted of the delegates of the states&#x27; governments. There was no head of state, but the Austrian delegate presided over the Assembly (according to the Bundesakte). Austria did not have extra powers, but consequently the Austrian delegate was called and Austria the (presiding power). The Assembly met in Frankfurt.

The Confederation was enabled to accept and deploy ambassadors. It allowed ambassadors of the European powers to the Assembly, but rarely deployed ambassadors itself.

During the revolution of 1848/49 the Federal Assembly was inactive. It transferred its powers to the , the revolutionary German Central Government of the Frankfurt National Assembly. After crushing the revolution and illegally disbanding the National Assembly, the Prussian King failed to create a German nation state by himself. The Federal Assembly was revived in 1850 on Austrian initiative, but only fully reinstalled in the Summer of 1851.

Rivalry between Prussia and Austria grew more and more, especially after 1859. The Confederation was dissolved in 1866 after the Austro-Prussian War, and was succeeded in 1866 by the Prussian-dominated North German Confederation. Unlike the German Confederation, the North German Confederation was in fact a true state. Its territory comprised the parts of the German Confederation north of the river Main, plus Prussia&#x27;s eastern territories and the Duchy of , but excluded Austria and the other southern German states.

Prussia&#x27;s influence was widened by the Franco-Prussian War resulting in the proclamation of the German Empire at on 18 January 1871, which united the North German Federation with the southern German states. All the constituent states of the former German Confederation became part of the in 1871, except Austria, Luxembourg, the Duchy of Limburg, and Liechtenstein.

==Impact of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic invasions==
The late 18th century was a period of political, economic, intellectual, and cultural reforms, the Enlightenment (represented by figures such as Locke, , , and Adam Smith), but also involving early Romanticism, and climaxing with the French Revolution, where freedom of the individual and nation was asserted against privilege and custom. Representing a great variety of types and theories, they were largely a response to the disintegration of previous cultural patterns, coupled with new patterns of production, specifically the rise of industrial capitalism.

However, the defeat of Napoleon enabled conservative and reactionary regimes such as those of the Kingdom of Prussia, the Austrian Empire, and Tsarist Russia to survive, laying the groundwork for the Congress of Vienna and the alliance that strove to oppose radical demands for change ushered in by the French Revolution. With Austria&#x27;s position on the continent now intact and ostensibly secure under its reactionary premier , the Habsburg empire would serve as a barrier to contain the emergence of Italian and German nation-states as well, in addition to containing France. But this reactionary balance of power, aimed at blocking German and Italian nationalism on the continent, was precarious.

After Napoleon&#x27;s final defeat in 1815, the surviving member states of the defunct Holy Roman Empire joined to form the German Confederation ()a rather loose organization, especially because the two great rivals, the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia, each feared domination by the other.

In Prussia the rulers forged a centralized state. By the time of the Napoleonic Wars, Prussia, grounded in the virtues of its established military aristocracy (the &quot;&quot;) and stratified by rigid hierarchical lines, had been surpassed militarily and economically by France. After 1807, Prussia&#x27;s defeats by Napoleonic France highlighted the need for administrative, economic, and social reforms to improve the efficiency of the bureaucracy and encourage practical merit-based education. Inspired by the Napoleonic organization of German and Italian principalities, the Prussian Reform Movement led by and Count was conservative, enacted to preserve aristocratic privilege while modernizing institutions.

Outside Prussia, industrialization progressed slowly, and was held back because of political disunity, conflicts of interest between the nobility and merchants, and the continued existence of the guild system, which discouraged competition and innovation. While this kept the middle class at bay, affording the old order a measure of stability not seen in France, Prussia&#x27;s vulnerability to Napoleon&#x27;s military proved to many among the old order that a fragile, divided, and traditionalist Germany would be easy prey for its cohesive and industrializing neighbor.

The reforms laid the foundation for Prussia&#x27;s future military might by professionalizing the military and decreeing universal military conscription. In order to industrialize Prussia, working within the framework provided by the old aristocratic institutions, land reforms were enacted to break the monopoly of the &quot;s&quot; on land ownership, thereby also abolishing, among other things, the feudal practice of serfdom.

==Romanticism, nationalism, and liberalism in the era==
Although the forces unleashed by the French Revolution were seemingly under control after the Vienna Congress, the conflict between conservative forces and liberal nationalists was only deferred at best. The era until the failed 1848 revolution, in which these tensions built up, is commonly referred to as (&quot;pre-March&quot;), in reference to the outbreak of riots in March 1848.

This conflict pitted the forces of the old order against those inspired by the French Revolution and the Rights of Man. The breakdown of the competition was, roughly, the emerging capitalist bourgeoisie and petit-bourgeoisie (engaged mostly in commerce, trade, and industry), and the growing (and increasingly radicalized) industrial working class; and the other side associated with landowning aristocracy or military aristocracy (the &quot;s&quot;) in Prussia, the Habsburg monarchy in Austria, and the conservative notables of the small princely states and city-states in Germany.

Meanwhile, demands for change from below had been fomenting due to the influence of the French Revolution. Throughout the German Confederation, Austrian influence was paramount, drawing the ire of the nationalist movements. considered nationalism, especially the nationalist youth movement, the most pressing danger: German nationalism might not only repudiate Austrian dominance of the Confederation, but also stimulate nationalist sentiment within the Austrian Empire itself. In a multi-national polyglot state in which Slavs and Magyars outnumbered the Germans, the prospects of Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Polish, Serb, or Croatian sentiment along with middle class liberalism was certainly horrifying to the monarchist landed aristocracy.

Figures like , , , , , , and rose in the era. Father &#x27;s gymnastic associations exposed middle class German youth to nationalist and democratic ideas, which took the form of the nationalistic and liberal democratic college fraternities known as the . The Wartburg Festival in 1817 celebrated Martin Luther as a proto-German nationalist, linking Lutheranism to German nationalism, and helping arouse religious sentiments for the cause of German nationhood. The festival culminated in the burning of several books and other items that symbolized reactionary attitudes. One item was a book by . In 1819, was accused of spying for Russia, and then murdered by a theological student, , who was executed for the crime. Sand belonged to a militant nationalist faction of the . used the murder as a pretext to issue the Carlsbad Decrees of 1819, which dissolved the , cracked down on the liberal press, and seriously restricted academic freedom.

===High culture===

German artists and intellectuals, heavily influenced by the French Revolution, turned to Romanticism. At the universities, high-powered professors developed international reputations, especially in the humanities led by history and philology, which brought a new historical perspective to the study of political history, theology, philosophy, language, and literature. With (1770–1831) in philosophy, (1768–1834) in theology and (1795–1886) in history, the University of Berlin, founded in 1810, became the world&#x27;s leading university. , for example, professionalized history and set the world standard for historiography. By the 1830s, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology had emerged with world class science, led by (1769–1859) in natural science and (1777–1855) in mathematics. Young intellectuals often turned to politics, but their support for the failed Revolution of 1848 forced many into exile.

==Population==

===Demographic transition===
The population of the German Confederation (excluding Austria) grew 60% from 1815 to 1865, from 21,000,000 to 34,000,000. The era saw the demographic transition take place in Germany. It was a transition from high birth rates and high death rates to low birth and death rates as the country developed from a pre-industrial to a modernized agriculture and supported a fast-growing industrialized urban economic system. In previous centuries, the shortage of land meant that not everyone could marry, and marriages took place after age 25. The high birthrate was offset by a very high rate of infant mortality, plus periodic epidemics and harvest failures. After 1815, increased agricultural productivity meant a larger food supply, and a decline in famines, epidemics, and malnutrition. This allowed couples to marry earlier, and have more children. Arranged marriages became uncommon as young people were now allowed to choose their own marriage partners, subject to a veto by the parents. The upper and middle classes began to practice birth control, and a little later so too did the peasants. The population in 1800 was heavily rural, with only 8% of the people living in communities of 5,000 to 100,000 and another 2% living in cities of more than 100,000.

===Nobility===
In a heavily agrarian society, land ownership played a central role. Germany&#x27;s nobles, especially those in the East called &quot;&quot;, dominated not only the localities, but also the Prussian court, and especially the Prussian army. Increasingly after 1815, a centralized Prussian government based in Berlin took over the powers of the nobles, which in terms of control over the peasantry had been almost absolute. They retained control of the judicial system on their estates until 1848, as well as control of hunting and game laws. They paid no land tax until 1861 and kept their police authority until 1872, and controlled church affairs into the early 20th century. To help the nobility avoid indebtedness, Berlin set up a credit institution to provide capital loans in 1809, and extended the loan network to peasants in 1849. When the German Empire was established in 1871, the nobility controlled the army and the Navy, the bureaucracy, and the royal court; they generally set governmental policies.

===Peasantry===
Peasants continued to center their lives in the village, where they were members of a corporate body and helped manage community resources and monitor community life. In the East, they were serfs who were bound prominently to parcels of land. In most of Germany, farming was handled by tenant farmers who paid rents and obligatory services to the landlord, who was typically a nobleman. Peasant leaders supervised the fields and ditches and grazing rights, maintained public order and morals, and supported a village court which handled minor offenses. Inside the family, the patriarch made all the decisions and tried to arrange advantageous marriages for his children. Much of the villages&#x27; communal life centered around church services and holy days. In Prussia, the peasants drew lots to choose conscripts required by the army. The noblemen handled external relationships and politics for the villages under their control, and were not typically involved in daily activities or decisions.

===Rapidly growing cities===
After 1815, the urban population grew rapidly, due primarily to the influx of young people from the rural areas. Berlin grew from 172,000 people in 1800 to 826,000 in 1870; Hamburg grew from 130,000 to 290,000; Munich from 40,000 to 269,000; (now ) from 60,000 to 208,000; Dresden from 60,000 to 177,000; (now Kaliningrad) from 55,000 to 112,000. Offsetting this growth, there was extensive emigration, especially to the United States. Emigration totaled 480,000 in the 1840s, 1,200,000 in the 1850s, and 780,000 in the 1860s.

===Ethnic minorities===
Despite its name and intention, the German Confederation was not entirely populated by Germans; many people of other ethnic groups lived within its borders: 
* French-speaking Walloons lived in western Luxembourg prior to its division in 1839; 
* the Duchy of Limburg (a member between 1839 and 1866) had an entirely Dutch population; 
* Italians and Slovenians lived in south and southeast Austria; 
* Bohemia and Moravia, of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were inhabited by a majority of Czechs; 
* Silesia had also a Polish and Czech inhabitants, while Sorbs were present in the parts of Saxony and the Prussian province of Brandenburg known as Lusatia
* Prussian part of the partitions of Poland was inhabited by a majority of Poles.

==: economic integration==
Further efforts to improve the confederation began in 1834 with the establishment of a customs union, the . In 1834, the Prussian regime sought to stimulate wider trade advantages and industrialism by decreea logical continuation of the program of and less than two decades earlier. Historians have seen three Prussian goals: as a political tool to eliminate Austrian influence in Germany; as a way to improve the economies; and to strengthen Germany against potential French aggression while reducing the economic independence of smaller states.

Inadvertently, these reforms sparked the unification movement and augmented a middle class demanding further political rights, but at the time backwardness and Prussia&#x27;s fears of its stronger neighbors were greater concerns. The customs union opened up a common market, ended tariffs between states, and standardized weights, measures, and currencies within member states (excluding Austria), forming the basis of a proto-national economy.

By 1842 the included most German states. Within the next twenty years, the output of German furnaces increased fourfold. Coal production grew rapidly as well. In turn, German industry (especially the works established by the family) introduced the steel gun, cast-steel axle, and a breech-loading rifle, exemplifying Germany&#x27;s successful application of technology to weaponry. Germany&#x27;s security was greatly enhanced, leaving the Prussian state and the landowning aristocracy secure from outside threat. German manufacturers also produced heavily for the civilian sector. No longer would Britain supply half of Germany&#x27;s needs for manufactured goods, as it did beforehand. However, by developing a strong industrial base, the Prussian state strengthened the middle class and thus the nationalist movement. Economic integration, especially increased national consciousness among the German states, made political unity a far likelier scenario. Germany finally began exhibiting all the features of a proto-nation.

The crucial factor enabling Prussia&#x27;s conservative regime to survive the era was a rough coalition between leading sectors of the landed upper class and the emerging commercial and manufacturing interests. Even if the commercial and industrial element is weak, it must be strong enough (or soon become strong enough) to become worthy of co-optation, and the French Revolution terrified enough perceptive elements of Prussia&#x27;s &quot;s&quot; for the state to be sufficiently accommodating.

While relative stability was maintained until 1848, with enough bourgeois elements still content to exchange the &quot;right to rule for the right to make money&quot;, the landed upper class found its economic base sinking. While the brought economic progress and helped to keep the bourgeoisie at bay for a while, it increased the ranks of the middle class swiftlythe very social base for the nationalism and liberalism that the Prussian state sought to stem.

The was a move toward economic integration, modern industrial capitalism, and the victory of centralism over localism, quickly bringing to an end the era of guilds in the small German princely states. This led to the 1844 revolt of the Silesian Weavers, who saw their livelihood destroyed by the flood of new manufactures.

The also weakened Austrian domination of the Confederation as economic unity increased the desire for political unity and nationalism.

==Revolutions of 1848==

News of the 1848 Revolution in Paris quickly reached discontented bourgeois liberals, republicans and more radical working-men. The first revolutionary uprisings in Germany began in the state of in March 1848. Within a few days, there were revolutionary uprisings in other states including Austria, and finally in Prussia. On 15 March 1848, the subjects of of Prussia vented their long-repressed political aspirations in violent rioting in Berlin, while barricades were erected in the streets of Paris. King of France fled to Great Britain. gave in to the popular fury, and promised a constitution, a parliament, and support for German unification, safeguarding his own rule and regime.

On 18 May, the Frankfurt Parliament (Frankfurt Assembly) opened its first session, with delegates from various German states. It was immediately divided between those favoring a (small German) or (greater German) solution. The former favored offering the imperial crown to Prussia. The latter favored the Habsburg crown in Vienna, which would integrate Austria proper and Bohemia (but not Hungary) into the new Germany.

In May to August, the Assembly installed a provisional German Central Government, while conservatives swiftly moved against the reformers. As in Austria and Russia, this middle-class assertion increased authoritarian and reactionary sentiments among the landed upper class, whose economic position was declining. They turned to political levers to preserve their rule. As the Prussian army proved loyal, and the peasants were uninterested, regained his confidence. The Assembly belatedly issued its Declaration of the Rights of the German People; a constitution was drawn up (excluding Austria, which openly rejected the Assembly), and the leadership of the was offered to , who refused to &quot;pick up a crown from the gutter&quot;. As the monarchist forces marched their armies to crush rebellions in cities and towns throughout Austria and Germany the Frankfurt Assembly was forced to flee, first to Stuttgart and then to Württemberg, where, reduced to so few deputies that it could no longer form a quorum, its final meeting was forcibly dispersed on 18 June 1849 by the Württemberg army. With the complete triumph of monarchist reaction rampaging across all of Europe, thousands of German middle class liberals and &quot;red&quot; Forty-eighters were forced to flee into exile (primarily to the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia).

In 1849, proposed his own constitution. His document concentrated real power in the hands of the King and the upper classes, and called for a confederation of North German statesthe Erfurt Union. Austria and Russia, fearing a strong, Prussian-dominated Germany, responded by pressuring Saxony and Hanover to withdraw, and forced Prussia to abandon the scheme in a treaty dubbed the &quot;humiliation of&quot;.

==Dissolution of the Confederation==
===Rise of Bismarck===
A new generation of statesmen responded to popular demands for national unity for their own ends, continuing Prussia&#x27;s tradition of autocracy and reform from above. Germany found an able leader to accomplish the seemingly paradoxical task of conservative modernization. In 1851, Bismarck was appointed by King Wilhelm I of Prussia (the future Kaiser Wilhelm I) to circumvent the liberals in the Landtag of Prussia, who resisted Wilhelm&#x27;s autocratic militarism. Bismarck told the Diet, &quot;The great questions of the day are not decided by speeches and majority votes ... but by blood and iron&quot; – that is, by warfare and industrial might. Prussia already had a great army; it was now augmented by rapid growth of economic power.

Gradually, Bismarck subdued the more restive elements of the middle class with a combination of threats and reforms, reacting to the revolutionary sentiments expressed in 1848 by providing them with the economic opportunities for which the urban middle sectors had been fighting.

===Seven Weeks&#x27; War===
The German Confederation ended as a result of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 between the Austrian Empire and its allies on one side and the Kingdom of Prussia and its allies on the other. The Confederation had 33 members immediately before its dissolution. In the Prague peace treaty, on 23 August 1866, Austria had to accept that the Confederation was dissolved. The following day, the remaining member states confirmed the dissolution. The treaty allowed Prussia to create a new (a new kind of federation) in the North of Germany. The South German states were allowed to create a South German Confederation but this did not come into existence.

===North German Confederation===
Prussia created the North German Confederation in 1867, a federal state combining all German states north of the river Main and also the Hohenzollern territories in Swabia. Besides Austria, the South German states Bavaria, , , and Hesse- remained separate from the rest of Germany. However, due to the successful prosecution of the Franco-Prussian War, the four southern states joined the North German Confederation by treaties in November 1870.

===German Empire===
As the Franco-Prussian War drew to a close, King Ludwig II of Bavaria was persuaded to ask King Wilhelm to assume the crown of the new German Empire. On 1 January 1871, the Empire was declared by the presiding princes and generals in the Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles, near Paris. The Diet of the North German Confederation moved to rename the North German Confederation as the German Empire and gave the title of German Emperor to the King of Prussia. The new constitution of the state, the Constitution of the German Confederation, effectively transformed the Diet of the Confederation into the German Parliament (&quot;Reichstag&quot;).

== Legacy ==
The modern German nation state known as the Federal Republic is the continuation of the North German Confederation of 1867. This North German Confederation, a federal state, was a totally new creation: the law of the German Confederation ended, and new law came into existence. The German Confederation was, according to historian Kotulla, an association of states &quot;(Staatenbund)&quot; with some elements of a federal state &quot;(Bundesstaat)&quot;, and the North German Confederation was a federal state with some elements of an association of states.

Still, the discussions and ideas of the period 1815–66 had a huge influence on the constitution of the North German Confederation. Most notably may be the Federal Council, the organ representing the member states. It is a certain copy of the 1815 Federal Convention of the German Confederation. The successor of that Federal Council of 1867 is the modern Bundesrat of the Federal Republic.

The German Confederation does not play a very prominent role in German historiography and national culture. It is mainly seen negatively as an instrument to oppress the liberal, democratic and national movements of the period. On the contrary, the March revolution (1849/49) with its events and institutions attract much more attention and partially devotion. The most important memorial sites are the Paulskirche in Frankfurt, which is now a cultural hall of national importance, and the Rastatt castle with the &quot;Erinnerungsstätte für die Freiheitsbewegungen in der deutschen Geschichte&quot; (a museum and memorial site for the freedom movements in the German history, not only the March revolution).

The remnants of the federal fortifications are certain tourists attractions at least regionally or for people interested in military history.

==Territorial legacy==
The current countries whose territory were partly or entirely located inside the boundaries of the German Confederation 1815–1866 are:
* Germany (all states except Southern in the north of )
* Austria (all states except )
* Luxembourg (entire territory)
* Liechtenstein (entire territory)
* Netherlands (Duchy of Limburg, was a member of the Confederation from 1839 until 1866)
* Czech Republic (entire territory)
* Slovenia (except for and the municipalities of , and )
* Poland (West Pomeranian Voivodship, Voivodship, Lower Silesian Voivodship, Voivodship, part of Silesia – overwhelmingly German speaking at the time; East Prussia, West Prussia, and much of the Grand Duchy of Posen were admitted into the Confederation on 11 April 1848, but the terms of the restored Confederate Diet removed these territories on 30 May 1851)
* Belgium (nine of the eleven cantons of Eupen-Malmedy, Liège Province); the larger province of Luxembourg had left the Confederation at its accession to Belgium in 1839
* Italy (autonomous region of /, the Province of Trieste, most of the Province of Gorizia except the enclave, and the municipalities of , , , , , and in the Province of Udine)
* Croatia (the territory in Istria county and the coastal strip between and in the Liburnia region)

Denmark proper has never been a member state, but its king was at the same time the duke of the member states Holstein and Lauenburg. The Duchy of Schleswig (which nowadays partially belongs to Denmark) was never a part of the Confederation although it was mentioned in the 1849 Frankfurt Constitution and governed briefly by a government installed by the German Central Government. However, Holstein, Lauenburg and Schleswig were combined under an Austrian-Prussian condominium in 1864–1866.

<text>The Austro-Prussian War (German: &quot;Preußisch-Österreichischer Krieg&quot;), also known by many other names, was fought in 1866 between the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia, with each also being aided by various allies within the German Confederation. Prussia had also allied with the Kingdom of Italy, linking this conflict to the Third Independence War of Italian unification. The Austro-Prussian War was part of the wider rivalry between Austria and Prussia, and resulted in Prussian dominance over the German states.

The major result of the war was a shift in power among the German states away from Austrian and towards Prussian hegemony. It resulted in the abolition of the German Confederation and its partial replacement by the unification of all of the northern German states in the North German Confederation that excluded Austria and the other southern German states, a . The war also resulted in the Italian annexation of the Austrian realm of Venetia.

==Outbreak of war==
The war erupted as a result of the dispute between Prussia and Austria over the administration of Schleswig-Holstein, which the two of them had conquered from Denmark and agreed to jointly occupy at the end of the Second Schleswig War in 1864. The crisis started on 26 January 1866, when Prussia protested the decision of the Austrian Governor of Holstein to permit the estates of the duchies to call up a united assembly, declaring the Austrian decision a breach of the principle of joint sovereignty. Austria replied on 7 February, asserting that its decision did not infringe on Prussia&#x27;s rights in the duchies. In March 1866, Austria reinforced its troops along its frontier with Prussia. Prussia responded with a partial mobilization of five divisions on 28 March.

The Prussian Minister President Otto von Bismarck made an alliance with Italy on 8 April, committing it to the war if Prussia entered one against Austria within three months, which was an obvious incentive for Bismarck to go to war with Austria within three months so that Italy would divert Austrian strength away from Prussia. Austria responded with a mobilization of its Southern Army on the Italian border on 21 April. Italy called for a general mobilization on 26 April and Austria ordered its own general mobilization the next day. Prussia&#x27;s general mobilization orders were signed in steps on 3, 5, 7, 8, 10 and 12 May.

When Austria brought the Schleswig-Holstein dispute before the German Diet on 1 June and also decided on 5 June to convene the Diet of Holstein on 11 June, Prussia declared that the Gastein Convention of 14 August 1865 had thereby been nullified and invaded Holstein on 9 June. When the German Diet responded by voting for a partial mobilization against Prussia on 14 June, Bismarck claimed that the German Confederation had ended. The Prussian Army invaded Hanover, Saxony and the Electorate of Hesse on 15 June. Italy declared war on Austria on 20 June.

==Causes==

For several centuries, Central Europe was split into a few large- or medium-sized states and hundreds of tiny entities, which while ostensibly being within the Holy Roman Empire ruled by the Holy Roman Emperor, operated in a largely independent fashion. When an existing Emperor died, seven secular and ecclesiastical princes, each of whom ruled at least one of the states, would elect a new Emperor. Over time the Empire became smaller and by 1789 came to consist of primarily German peoples (aside from Bohemia, Moravia, the southern Netherlands and Slovenia). Aside from five years (1740–1745), the Habsburg family, whose personal territory was Austria, controlled the Emperorship from 1440 to 1806, although it became increasingly ceremonial only as Austria found itself at war at certain times with other states within the Empire, such as Prussia, which in fact defeated Austria during the War of Austrian Succession to seize the province of Silesia in 1742. While Austria was traditionally considered the leader of the German states, Prussia became increasingly powerful and by the late 18th century was ranked as one of the great powers of Europe. Francis II&#x27;s abolition of the office of Holy Roman Emperor in 1806 also deprived him of his imperial authority over most of German-speaking Europe, though little true authority remained by that time; he did, however, retain firm control of an extensive multi-ethnic empire (most of it outside the previous boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire). After 1815, the German states were once again reorganized into a loose confederation: the German Confederation, under Austrian leadership. Prussia had been contesting Austria&#x27;s supremacy in Germany since at least 1850, when a war between the two powers had nearly erupted over Prussia&#x27;s leadership of the Erfurt Union, though at that time Prussia had backed down.

=== Nationalism ===

At the time of the war, there was no strong national consciousness in Germany. Michael Hughes notes that in regards to Germany, &quot;nationalism was a minority movement, deeply divided and with only a marginal impact on German political life&quot;. German newspapers were almost exclusively concerned with local affairs or their respective state governments, and the individual German states cultivated loyalty towards themselves. While rivalry with France was an important element of German nationalist myth-making, many Germans cooperated with France during the Napoleonic Era, and those who resisted France did not do so out of nationalist sentiment. According to John Breuilly, any sense of a common German identity &quot;was weakly developed and confined to particular groups&quot; and &quot;there was very little demand, certainly at popular level, for unification&quot;. The liberal-nationalist concept of a united Germany had also become unpopular following the fall of the Frankfurt Parliament in 1849. One of the strongest social forces in Germany at the time was religion, which provided Germans with common confessional values and identities that transcended national boundaries. This led to a strong confessional rivalry between the southern Catholic and northern Protestant states. Breuilly remarks that the confessional rivalry was so strong that &quot;a Hamburg Lutheran had more in common with a Swedish Lutheran than with an Austrian Catholic&quot;. The minor nations of Germany valued their independence and believed that their ability to remain sovereign depended on Austro-Prussian dualism, with neither side allowed to become too powerful. Confessional division also played an important role in German dualism, and there was a strong pressure in Catholic states to support Austria. In the absence of nationalist sentiment, a united German state could only be created through external force. Bismarck recognised this, remarking in 1862 that a united German state could not be forged through &quot;speeches and majority decisions&quot; but only through &quot;blood and iron&quot;.

=== Bismarck&#x27;s plot ===
There are many interpretations of Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s behaviour before the Austrian-Prussian war, which concentrate mainly on the fact that he had a master plan that resulted in this war, the North German Confederation and the unification of Germany. Bismarck maintained that he orchestrated the conflict in order to bring about the North German Confederation, the Franco-Prussian War and the eventual unification of Germany.

On 22 February 1866, Count Károlyi, Austrian ambassador in Berlin, sent a dispatch to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Count Alexander Mensdorff-Pouilly. He explained to him that Prussian public opinion had become extremely sensitive about the Duchies issue and that he had no doubt that &quot;this artificial exaggeration of the danger by public opinion formed an essential part of the calculations and actions of Count Bismarck [who considered] the annexation of the Duchies ... a matter of life and death for his political existence [and wished] to make it appear such for Prussia too.&quot;

Possible evidence can be found in Bismarck&#x27;s orchestration of the Austrian alliance during the Second Schleswig War against Denmark, which can be seen as his diplomatic &quot;masterstroke&quot;. Taylor also believes that the alliance was a &quot;test for Austria rather than a trap&quot; and that the goal was not war with Austria, contradicting what Bismarck later gave in his memoirs as his main reason for establishing the alliance. It was in the Prussian interest to gain an alliance with Austria to defeat Denmark and settle the issue of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. The alliance can be regarded as an aid to Prussian expansion, rather than a provocation of war against Austria. Many historians believe that Bismarck was simply a Prussian expansionist, rather than a German nationalist, who sought the unification of Germany. It was at the Gastein Convention that the Austrian alliance was set up to lure Austria into war.

The timing of the Italo-Prussian Alliance of 8 April 1866 was perfect, because all other European powers were either bound by alliances that forbade them from entering the conflict, or had domestic problems that had priority. The reason why none of the great powers of Europe intervened is listed below:

Britain: Britain had no stake economically or politically in the war between Prussia and Austria, thus, was not going to intervene.
Russia: Russia was unlikely to enter on the side of Austria, due to ill will over Austrian support of the anti-Russian alliance during the Crimean War and Prussia had stood by Russia during the January Uprising in Poland, signing the Alvensleben Convention of February 1863 with Russia, whereas Austria had not.

France: France was also unlikely to enter on the side of Austria, because Bismarck and Napoleon III met in Biarritz and allegedly discussed whether or not France would intervene in a potential Austro-Prussian war. The details of the discussion are unknown but many historians think Bismarck was guaranteed French neutrality in the event of a war.

Italy: Italy had already allied itself with Prussia because it wanted Lombardy-Venetia. This meant that Austria would be fighting both Italy and Prussia, without any non-German allies of its own.

Bismarck was aware of an available numerical superiority but still &quot;he was not prepared to advise it immediately even though he gave a favourable account of the international situation&quot;.

=== Military factors ===

Bismarck may well have been encouraged to go to war by the advantages of the Prussian army against the Austrian Empire. Taylor wrote that Bismarck was reluctant to pursue war as it &quot;deprived him of control and left the decisions to the generals whose ability he distrusted&quot;. (The two most important personalities within the Prussian army were the War Minister Albrecht Graf von Roon and Chief of the General Staff Helmuth Graf von Moltke.) Taylor suggested that Bismarck was hoping to force Austrian leaders into concessions in Germany, rather than provoke war. The truth may be more complicated than simply that Bismarck, who famously said that &quot;politics is the art of the possible&quot;, initially sought war with Austria or was initially against the idea of going to war with Austria.

==== Rival military systems ====
In 1862, von Roon had implemented several army reforms that ensured that all Prussian citizens were liable to conscription. Before this date, the size of the army had been fixed by earlier laws that had not taken population growth into account, making conscription inequitable and unpopular for this reason. While some Prussian men remained in the army or the reserves until they were forty years old, about one man in three (or even more in some regions where the population had expanded greatly as a result of industrialisation) was assigned minimal service in the , the home guard.

Introducing universal conscription for three years increased the size of the active duty army and provided Prussia with a reserve army equal in size to that which Moltke deployed against Austria. Had France under Napoleon III attempted to intervene against the Prussians, they could have faced him with equal or superior numbers of troops.

Prussian conscript service was one of continuous training and drill, in contrast to the Austrian army where some commanders routinely dismissed infantry conscripts to their homes on permanent leave soon after their induction into the army, retaining only a cadre of long-term soldiers for formal parades and routine duties. Austrian conscripts had to be trained almost from scratch when they were recalled to their units on the outbreak of war. The Prussian army was thus better trained and disciplined than the Austrian army, particularly in the infantry. While Austrian cavalry and artillery were as well trained as their Prussian counterparts, with Austria possessing two elite divisions of heavy cavalry, weapons and tactics had advanced since the Napoleonic Wars and cavalry charges had been rendered obsolete.

==== Speed of mobilization ====

The Prussian army was locally based, organized in (military districts, lit.: circles), each containing a Korps headquarters and its component units. Most reservists lived close to their regimental depots and could be swiftly mobilized. Austrian policy was to ensure that units were stationed far from home to prevent them from taking part in separatist revolts. Conscripts on leave or reservists recalled to their units during mobilization faced a journey that might take weeks before they could report to their units, making the Austrian mobilization much slower than that of the Prussian Army.

==== Speed of concentration ====
The railway system of Prussia was more extensively developed than that within Austria. Railways made it possible to supply larger numbers of troops than hitherto and allowed the rapid movement of troops within friendly territory. The more efficient Prussian rail network allowed the Prussian army to concentrate more rapidly than the Austrians. Moltke, reviewing his plans to Roon stated, &quot;We have the inestimable advantage of being able to carry our Field Army of 285,000 men over five railway lines and of virtually concentrating them in twenty-five days. ... Austria has only one railway line and it will take her forty-five days to assemble 200,000 men.&quot; Moltke had also said earlier, &quot;Nothing could be more welcome to us than to have now the war that we must have.&quot;

The Austrian army under Ludwig von Benedek in Bohemia (the present-day Czech Republic) might previously have been expected to enjoy the advantage of the &quot;central position&quot;, by being able to concentrate on successive attacking armies strung out along the frontier, but the quicker Prussian concentration nullified this advantage. By the time the Austrians were fully assembled, they would be unable to concentrate against one Prussian army without having the other two instantly attack their flank and rear, threatening their lines of communication.

==== Armaments and tactics ====

Prussian infantry were equipped with the Dreyse needle gun, a bolt-action rifle which could be fired faster than the muzzle-loading Lorenz rifles of the Austrian army. In the Franco-Austrian War of 1859, French troops took advantage of poorly trained enemies who did not readjust their gunsights as they got closerthus firing too high at close range. By rapidly closing the range, French troops came to close quarters with an advantage over the Austrian infantry. After the war, the Austrians adopted the same methods, which they termed the (&quot;shock tactics&quot;). Although they had some warnings of the Prussian weapon, they ignored these and retained .

The Austrians were equipped with breech-loading rifled cannon, which was superior to the Prussian muzzle loading smooth bore cannon. The Austrian Artillery used a unique rifling system invented by Wilhelm Lenk von Wolfsberg called the Lenk system. The Prussians, however, by this point had replaced up to 60% of their smooth bore artillery with the technologically superior C64 (field gun), which had been in production since 1859. However, due to tactical reluctance on the part of Prussian high command to utilise relatively unfamiliar technology, and doctrinal stagnation in the Artillery Corps, the modern Krupp guns were either sent to reserve units or used in tandem and to the same effect as their smooth bore counterparts, something that massively throttled their effectiveness in the war, and many of the guns that saw combat were the old smooth bore muzzle loaders. The Austrians too, while having standardised the Lenk system of rifling in their cannon, did not use their artillery to full effect. They specifically targeted the Prussian artillery with their own batteries, limiting their impact on the battlefield in regards to Prussian infantry. One notable exception is the use of Austrian artillery to good effect against infantry at Battle of Königgrätz.

The Generals of the Prussian army realized that, in order to stay ahead of their Austrian enemies, they needed to explore new military tactics. They sent officers to travel across the Atlantic Ocean to go and observe the American Civil War. These officers met with high ranking commanders and recorded both Union and Confederate tactics. They wrote about troop movements, artillery positioning, and new methods of attack that worked well for the Americans. These officers then travelled back to Prussia and briefed their generals about these observations. Some officers, such as Justus Scheibert, published their adventures in America for the public to enjoy.

=== Economic factors ===

In 1866, the Prussian economy was rapidly growing, partly as a result of the , which gave Prussia an advantage in the war. Prussia could equip its armies with breech-loading rifles and later with new Krupp breech-loading artillery but the Austrian economy was suffering from the effects of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and the Second Italian War of Independence. Austria had only one bank, the Creditanstalt, and the state was heavily in debt. Historian Christopher Clark wrote that there is little to suggest that Prussia had an overwhelming economic and industrial advantage over Austria and wrote that a larger portion of the Prussian population was engaged in agriculture than in the Austrian population and that Austrian industry could produce the most sophisticated weapons in the war (rifled artillery). The Austro-Prussian War ended quickly and was fought mainly with existing weapons and munitions, which reduced the influence of economic and industrial power relative to politics and military culture.

== Alliances ==
Before the war started, both the Austrian and Prussian governments sought to rally allies in Germany. On 15 June Bismarck offered territorial compensation in the Grand Duchy of Hesse to the Electorate of Hesse, if Elector Frederick William were to ally with Prussia. The proposition grievously offended Frederick William&#x27;s &quot;legitimist sensibilities&quot; and the monarch joined the Austrians, despite the Hessian voting for neutrality. King George V of Hanover during the spring of 1866 was contacted by Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph about establishing a coalition against the Prussians, but his success took some time. The Hanoverian monarch concluded that his kingdom would fall if it were to fight against the Prussian armies.

Most of the southern German states sided with Austria against Prussia. Those doing so included the Kingdoms of Bavaria and Württemberg. Smaller middle states such as Baden, Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), Hesse-Darmstadt, and Nassau also joined with Austria. Many of the German princes allied with the Habsburgs principally out of a desire to keep their thrones.

Most of the northern German states joined Prussia, in particular Oldenburg, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and Brunswick. The Kingdom of Italy participated in the war with Prussia, because Austria held Venetia and other, smaller territories wanted by Italy to further the process of Italian unification. In return for Italian aid against Austria, Bismarck agreed not to make a separate peace until Italy had obtained Venetia.

Notably, the other foreign powers abstained from this war. French Emperor Napoleon III, a friend of Italian risorgimento who expected a Prussian defeat, chose to retain the unmobilized army, upholding his influence to suit Florence while endangering his negotiating position for territory along the Rhine. When the Prussian victory became clear, Paris attempted to extract concessions in the Palatinate, Rhenish Hesse and Luxembourg. In his speech to the Reichstag on 2 May 1871, Bismarck said:

== Course of the war ==
The first war between two major continental powers in seven years, it used many of the same technologies as the Second Italian War of Independence, including railways to concentrate troops during mobilization and telegraphy to enhance long-distance communication. The Prussian Army used von Dreyse&#x27;s breech-loading needle gun, which could be rapidly loaded while the soldier was seeking cover on the ground, whereas the Austrian muzzle-loading rifles could be loaded only slowly, and generally from a standing position.

The main campaign of the war occurred in Bohemia. Prussian Chief of General Staff Helmuth von Moltke had planned meticulously for the war. He rapidly mobilized the Prussian army and advanced across the border into Saxony and Bohemia, where the Austrian army was concentrating for an invasion of Silesia. There, the Prussian armies, led nominally by King William I, converged, and the two sides met at the Battle of Königgrätz (Hradec Králové) on 3 July. The Prussian Army of the Elbe advanced on the Austrian left wing, and the First Army on the center, prematurely; they risked being counter-flanked on their own left. Victory therefore depended on the timely arrival of the Second Army on the left wing. This was achieved through the brilliant work of its Chief of Staff, Leonhard Graf von Blumenthal. Superior Prussian organization and élan decided the battle against Austrian numerical superiority, and the victory was near total, with Austrian battle deaths nearly seven times the Prussian figure. An armistice between Prussia and Austria came into effect at noon on 22 July. A preliminary peace was signed on 26 July at Nikolsburg.
Except for Saxony, the other German states allied to Austria played little role in the main campaign. Hanover&#x27;s army defeated Prussia at the Second Battle of Langensalza on 27 June 1866, but, within a few days, they were forced to surrender by superior numbers. Prussian armies fought against Bavaria, Württemberg, Baden and the Hessian states on the river Main, reaching Nuremberg and Frankfurt. The Bavarian fortress of Würzburg was shelled by Prussian artillery, but the garrison defended its position until armistice day.

The Austrians were more successful in their war with Italy, defeating the Italians on land at the Battle of Custoza (24 June), and on sea at the Battle of Lissa (20 July). However, Italy&#x27;s &quot;Hunters of the Alps&quot; led by Garibaldi defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Bezzecca on 21 July, conquered the lower part of Trentino, and moved towards Trento. While the temporary Alpine conquest missed political support by allies, a redeployment of Austrian troops in order to hold the Danube facilitated an Italian march through the Venetian coastal plain, resulting in the armistice of Cormons on 12 August.

* 24 July, Battle of Tauberbischofsheim, the Federal 8th Corps (Württemberg, Baden, Hesse and Nassau) is defeated by Prussia and northern Württemberg is occupied.

== Aftermath and consequences ==
In order to prevent &quot;unnecessary bitterness of feeling or desire for revenge&quot; and forestall intervention by France or Russia, Bismarck pushed King William I of Prussia to make peace with the Austrians rapidly, rather than continue the war in hopes of further gains. William had &quot;planned to install both the crown prince of Hanover and the nephew of the elector of Hesse as titular grand dukes in small territorial residuals of their dynastic inheritance&quot; due to opposition in the government cabinet, including Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia, to the annexation of several German states. The Austrians accepted mediation from France&#x27;s Napoleon III. The Peace of Prague on 23 August 1866 resulted in the dissolution of the German Confederation, Prussian annexation of four of Austria&#x27;s former allies, and the permanent exclusion of Austria from German affairs.

=== For the new Prussia ===

This left Berlin free to form the North German Confederation finalized the next year, incorporating all the German states north of the Main River. Prussia&#x27;s Polish as well as its remote Danish and Lithuanian regions were also encompassed. Bismarck backed up the Kingdom&#x27;s dominance over the so-called Lesser Germany with an emerging Russian alliance.

The vanishing authorities protested against their annexation to King Wilhelm&#x27;s Hohenzollern monarchy, and both the dethroned rulers and the local population lamented the loss of sovereignty. Anti-Prussian and separatist sentiment in the new provinces continued into 1871, as local Prussian authorities complained about &quot;a not insignificant number&quot; of deserters from Hanover and Schleswig, and the population reacted to the Franco-Prussian War with &quot;recurrent acts of sabotage on telegraph lines, latent French sympathies, and a widespread disinterest in the establishment of armed home guards&quot;. Nevertheless, the formed North German Confederation would go on to win the war and unite with Bavaria, Baden, Württemberg and southern Hesse in 1871. According to Geoffrey Wawro, the political and military power accumulated by Prussia allowed it to annex the northern German states in 1866 and then &quot;force the Catholic states very much against their will into a federal union&quot; in 1871. The resulting German Empire would become one of the most influential European powers.

=== For the defeated parties and Schleswig-Holstein ===
Local resistance and regional loyalty led Hans von Hardenberg, the civil commissioner who oversaw the integration of Hanover into Prussia, to remark that &quot;As a whole the Hanoverians are a tougher, less accommodating tribe than the Saxons. Their particularism rests not solely on Prussophobia .. . but above all on a deep-rooted conviction that life is nowhere better than in Hanover. Theirs is a solid ... national feeling&quot;. The protests of George V of Hanover and the local population proved to be an effective obstacle to Hanover&#x27;s assimilation into Prussia, and led to the founding of the German-Hanoverian Party, which received 46.6% of the Hanoverian vote in the March 1871 Reichstag election. Hostility to annexation was also felt in smaller annexed countries such as Hesse, where the dethroned Prince Frederick William of Hesse-Kassel strongly condemned &quot;the usurpation of the Electorate of Hesse by the crown of Prussia&quot;. Anti-annexationist petitions were organised and reached a significant number of signatures, with a separatist petition in Hanover reaching half a million signatures. In Nassau, Prussian soldiers were reportedly attacked by locals &quot;with stones and axes&quot;; according to Jasper Heinzen, &quot;brawls between occupation troops and local veterans soon became so prevalent that one historian has called these incidents the most distinctive inaugural feature of the Prussian era&quot;.

In addition to war reparations, the following cases of territorial changes took place:
* Austria: The use of the French Emperor as an intermediary was to avoid ceding the province directly to the Kingdom of Italy, which Austria considered an inferior power, and at the same time to influence Napoleon III in favor of Austria in the crisis with Prussia. Accordingly, Italy obtained Venetia by the Treaty of Vienna (3 October 1866). The agreed plebiscite claimed 99.99% wished to join Italy, the only country to gain fully owned Austrian territory from the conflict.
* Schleswig and Holstein (Austro-Prussian condominium): Became the Prussian Province of Schleswig-Holstein.
* Hanover: Annexed by Prussia, became the Province of Hanover.
* Hesse-Darmstadt: Surrendered to Prussia the small territory it had acquired earlier in 1866 on the extinction of the ruling house of Hesse-Homburg. The northern half of the remaining land joined the North German Confederation.
* Nassau, Hesse-Kassel, Frankfurt: Annexed by Prussia. Combined with the territory surrendered by Hesse-Darmstadt to form the new Province of Hesse-Nassau.
* Saxony, Saxe-Meiningen, Reuss-Greiz, Schaumburg-Lippe: Spared from annexation but joined the North German Confederation in the following year.

=== For the neutral German parties and Liechtenstein ===
Those former German Confederation member states who remained neutral or passive during the conflict took different actions after the Prague treaty:

* Liechtenstein: Became an independent state and declared permanent neutrality, while maintaining close political ties with Austria. Accused by Bismarck of having manipulated the Confederation Diet vote, the Principality had sent 80 men out on the Imperial side against the Italian volunteers but did not engage in any fighting. There has been a longstanding yet unverified claim that Liechtenstein&#x27;s auxiliary force returned home with an extra man, stated either as an &quot;Italian friend&quot; or a defector.
* Limburg and Luxembourg: The Treaty of London (1867) declared both of these Orange territories to be part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The northern duchy became the Dutch province of Limburg. Luxembourg was guaranteed independence and neutrality from its three surrounding neighbours (Belgium, France, and Prussia), but it remained tied to Holland until 1890 and a member of the German customs union, the &quot;Zollverein&quot;, until its dissolution in 1919.
* Reuss-Schleiz, Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt: Joined the North German Confederation.

===Bonapartist lure and lukewarm Austrian desire for revenge===

With respect to the exclusion from political Germany, the conciliatory Emperor Francis Joseph I did not face notable public pressure for resilience, although the French ruler made him restrict a negotiated freedom of the lesser South Germany to reunite with the North. Bismarck had to overcome the obdurate resistance of King Wilhelm I, interested in substantial annexations of Austrian territory, whereas himself, who wanted to keep all future possibilities open with regard to the enemy, intended to offer rather generous terms. The king finally yielded to Bismarck.

Having lost his position as minister-president of Saxony over his Prussian counterpart&#x27;s unwillingness to negotiate the peace with him, the new Austrian leader Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust was &quot;impatient to take his revenge on Bismarck for Sadowa&quot;. As a preliminary step, the with Hungary was &quot;rapidly concluded&quot;. The Protestant Beust &quot;persuaded Francis Joseph to accept Magyar demands which he had until then rejected&quot;, but Austrian plans fell short of French hopes (e.g. Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen proposed a plan which required the French army to fight alone for six weeks in order to allow Austrian mobilization). Victor Emmanuel II and the Italian government wanted to join this potential alliance, but Italian public opinion was bitterly opposed so long as Napoleon III kept a French garrison in Rome protecting Pope Pius IX, thereby denying Italy the possession of its capital (Rome had been declared capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament had met in Turin). Napoleon III was not strictly opposed to this (in response to a French minister of State&#x27;s declaration that Italy would never lay its hands on Rome, the Emperor had commented &quot;You know, in politics, one should never say &#x27;never&#x27;.&quot;) and had made various proposals for resolving the Roman Question, but Pius IX rejected them all. Despite his support for Italian unification, Napoleon could not press the issue for fear of angering Catholics in France. Raffaele de Cesare, an Italian journalist, political scientist, and author, noted that:

Another reason that Imperial Chancellor Beust&#x27;s supposedly desired &quot;revanche&quot; against Prussia did not materialize is seen in the fact that, in 1870, the Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Andrássy was &quot;vigorously opposed&quot;.

<text>Edward Brongersma (31 August 1911 in Haarlem, Netherlands – 22 April 1998 in Bloemendaal/Overveen, Netherlands) was a Dutch politician and doctor of law. For a number of years he was a member of the Dutch Senate for the Labour Party, and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He was primarily known for pedophilia advocacy and as an advocate of more lax legislation on public morality.

==Early life==
Brongersma was born in Haarlem as the son of an ophthalmologist. He studied law at the University of Amsterdam (1931–1935) and obtained his degree in 1935. From 1935 to 1937 he was associated with a law firm in Haarlem while working on his doctoral dissertation on the Portuguese constitution of 1933 and Portuguese corporatism of Antonio de Oliveira Salazar, whom he much admired at the time. In 1940 he received his Doctor of Law degree &quot;cum laude&quot; from the Catholic University of Nijmegen. His dissertation, on the subject of the corporative state in Portugal, was published as a book and was reprinted several times.

==Career==
After World War II he quickly made a career for himself as a lawyer and politician as well as a prolific writer. He worked as an attorney in Amsterdam from 1940 to 1950, and between 1946 and 1950 he was active within the editorial board of the Dutch journal for the legal profession, Nederlands Juristenblad. In 1946, he was elected to the Dutch Senate for the Dutch Labour Party (PvdA); his term lasted from 1946 to 1950 and later he had a second term, from 1963 to 1977. In the same period (1946–1950), he was a member for the Dutch Labour Party of the Provincial States of North Holland and served on the town council of Heemstede.

His career was abruptly interrupted in 1950, when he was arrested for having sexual relations with a 17-year-old male. At the time, the age of consent for homosexual contacts was 21, based on article 248bis Dutch Criminal Code. The conviction of Brongersma resulted in 11 months imprisonment.

He subsequently continued his career in the 1950s as a journalist and critic. From 1953 to 1956, he was a member of the executive committee of the Dutch Labour Party in the Utrecht region. In 1956 he was recruited for a four-year term as director of community work in Haarlem. As a result of his conviction, he had been disbarred in 1950, but re-admitted to the Dutch Bar in 1959. He resumed his legal practice and continued to work as a lawyer until 1980.

From 1960 to 1967, he was a senior lecturer at the Criminological Institute of Utrecht University, where he worked very closely with Professor of Law W. Pompe. In 1963, at the request of the Dutch Labour Party, he rejoined the Senate for a second term which would last until his resignation in 1977. From 1969 to 1977 he was chairman and spokesman for the Permanent Senate&#x27;s Committee for Justice. For his political service, he was made a Companion in the Order of the Dutch Lion on 29 April 1975. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee he functioned from 1969 to 1977.

Brongersma was primarily known for his publications and his advocacy of more lax morality legislation, a subject in which he was keenly interested. Because of his expertise, he played a major role in 1971 as a member of the Senate in abolishing Article 248bis of the Dutch Criminal Code, the same article on the basis of which he had been convicted in 1950. The age of consent for homosexual contacts was then lowered from 21 to 16 (the same as for heterosexual contacts). He advocated lowering the age of consent even further.

In the course of his lifetime he collected a number of scientific and academic publications on these themes, consisting of a library and personal archives. In 1979 he donated them to a foundation bearing his name, the object of which as stated in its articles of association was &quot;promoting scientific study and publications in the field of sexual relations between adults and young people.&quot; In 1992 the objective was broadened to &quot;promoting research of the sexual-emotional health of children and young people.&quot;

After resigning from the Dutch Senate in 1977, Brongersma devoted himself completely to the objectives of his foundation. It was then that he wrote his magnum opus &quot;Loving Boys&quot; (published in two parts, 1987 and 1990), while continuing to expand his collections.

==Work==
Brongersma published extensively on a wide variety of topics, authoring some 1200 books and articles between 1930 and 1998 on social and philosophical subjects such as criminal law, constitutional law, criminology, philosophy, religion, sexology, legislation on public morals and literary topics. He wrote books on the Civil War in Spain, Portugal and the Portuguese, penal law and social problems. Beginning with his years at the Criminological Institute, he wrote extensively in the area of sexology, especially on pornography, ephebophilia, pedophilia and the age of consent. His books on this subjects include: &quot;Das Verfehmte Geschlecht&quot; (in German, 1970), &quot;Sex en Straf&quot; (&quot;Sex and Punishment&quot;, 1972), &quot;Over pedofielen en kinderlokkers&quot; (&quot;On Pedophiles and Child Molesters&quot;, 1975), and his last work is his &quot;magnum opus&quot; and entitled &quot;Loving Boys&quot; (two volumes, 1988–1990).

Brongersma&#x27;s work and activism regarding pedophilia focused exclusively on homosexual pedophilia between males and admitted several times that he knew little or nothing about heterosexual or lesbian pedophilia. Brongersma opposed the other prominent figure in the 1970s pro-pedophile movement in the Netherlands, psychologist Frits Bernard, who considered pedophilia not pathological irrespective of the gender of the participants.

==Death==
Brongersma died in 1998 by means of voluntary euthanasia. His health failed and he grew lonely as his best friends died one by one. The social changes that had started in the 1980s, in response to the sexual revolution of the 1970s, caused him to become dispirited. Following his death, discussion flared up in the Netherlands as to whether people who were weary of life should be allowed to end their lives with the aid of a physician. Flip Sutorius, the doctor from Overveen who helped Brongersma in his chosen death, was prosecuted but not punished. The verdict was finally maintained in 2002 by the &quot;Hoge Raad&quot; (Dutch Supreme Court).

A great deal of commotion ensued following his death when some of the visual material in his collections was seized. The images were deemed to be child pornography. Legislation passed in 1996 made it an offence to have such pictures &quot;on hand&quot;.

After his death, his entire social-sexological collection as well as his private archives were placed in the International Institute for Social History (IISG) in Amsterdam (www.iisg.nl), this without the visual material which had been seized by the authorities. The executive board of the foundation continued its activities; in 1998, the &quot;Fund for Scientific Research of Sexuality&quot; was set up, with the stated aims of: obtaining more insight into sexual development processes in relation to social, emotional, cognitive and physical development; contributing to sexual health and to helping develop the capacity for relationships, and a sense of responsibility; supporting parents, guardians, educators, teachers, public relations officers and care and welfare workers by effectively channelling the knowledge gained from research; and promoting debate in circles of lawyers, sociologists, government officials and politicians on various social and legal frameworks.

<doc id="142283" wikidata="Q1910564" url="?curid=142283" title="Four-letter word">
<text>The term four-letter word serves as a euphemism for words that are often considered profane or offensive.

The designation &quot;four-letter&quot; arises from the observation that many (though not all) popular or slang terms related to excretory functions, sexual activity, genitalia, blasphemies, and terms linked to Hell or damnation are incidentally four-character monosyllables. Notably, the term &quot;four-letter word&quot; does not strictly refer to words containing exactly four letters.

The phrase has been in use in both the United States and the United Kingdom since at least 1886.

==History==
Common four-letter words (in this context) widely considered vulgar or offensive include: &quot;cunt&quot;, &quot;fuck&quot; (and regional variants like &quot;feck&quot;, &quot;fick&quot;, &quot;fock&quot;, and &quot;foak&quot;), &quot;&quot; (or &quot;gism&quot;), &quot;&quot;, &quot;shit&quot;, &quot;slut&quot;, &quot;twat&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. Notably, the term &quot;Piss&quot; (once an offensive swear word) has non-excretory uses (&quot;pissed off&quot; meaning &quot;angry&quot; in US English and British UK English; &quot;pissed&quot; meaning &quot;drunk&quot; in UK English and Australian English) and has occurred with its excretory meaning in the King James Bible. Some of these words have been deemed legally indecent under the regulations of the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for TV and radio open-airwave broadcasting.

Other words of this length that may be upsetting due to religious or personal sensitivity include: &quot;&quot; (UK), &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot; (UK). Additionally, slurs related to racism, ableism, and an individual&#x27;s sexual orientation may qualify, such as &quot;&quot; (in the UK not a racial slur, but short for Mongol, or someone with Down syndrome – previously called Mongolism), &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

Certain &quot;four-letter words&quot; have multiple meanings (some serving as given names) and usually only offend when used in their vulgar senses. Examples include: &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; (UK), and &quot;&quot; (UK). A borderline category includes words that are euphemistic evasions of &quot;stronger&quot; words and those that happen to be short, with both an expletive sound to some listeners and a sexual or excretory meaning (many also have other, non-vulgar meanings): &quot;&quot; (US), &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; (US), &quot;&quot; (UK, NZ, AUS), &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

Finally, some four-letter terms with limited usage can be considered offensive within the regional dialect they are used, such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

Occasionally, the phrase &quot;four-letter word&quot; is humorously used to describe common words composed of four letters. Examples include the word &quot;work&quot;, implying that work can be unpleasant, or the game of &quot;golf&quot;, jokingly referred to as a four-letter word when a player&#x27;s pastime becomes an exercise in frustration. In 1993, &quot;Charlotte Observer&quot; journalist Doug Robarchek noted how many U.S. politicians have names with four letters, humorously observing, &quot;Ever notice how many U.S. politicians have names that are also four-letter words? Ford, Dole, Duke, Bush, Gore ... and how many make us think of four-letter words?&quot;

==Similar euphemisms in other languages==
*Chinese: The term 三字經 (lit. Three Character Classic) is used to describe swearing, as many such phrases in Chinese consist of three characters.
*Dutch: A similar tradition occurs with &quot;three-letter words&quot;, e.g. &quot;kut&quot; (&quot;cunt&quot;/&quot;twat&quot;), &quot;pik&quot; and &quot;lul&quot; (&quot;cock&quot;/&quot;dick&quot;/&quot;prick&quot;).
*Finnish: Rude words tend to be five-letter words, like the common swear word &quot;perse&quot; meaning &quot;arse&quot;, or &quot;paska&quot; meaning &quot;shit&quot;. Other offensive five-letter words refer to the genital region, eg. &quot;kulli&quot; and &quot;kyrpä&quot; (&quot;cock&quot;/&quot;dick&quot;/&quot;prick&quot;), along with &quot;pillu&quot; and &quot;vittu&quot; (&quot;twat&quot;/&quot;cunt&quot;). 
*French: the word &quot;merde&quot; (&quot;shit&quot;) is sometimes referred to as &quot;le mot de cinq lettres&quot; (&quot;the five-letter word&quot;), or &quot;le mot de Cambronne&quot;. Also, profanities in French are usually called &quot;gros mots&quot; (coarse words).
*German: the phrase &quot;Setz dich auf deine vier Buchstaben!&quot; (&quot;sit down on your four letters&quot;) is mainly used speaking to children, as it refers to the word &quot;Popo&quot;, meaning &quot;rump&quot; in baby talk. A variant, &quot;Setz dich auf deine fünf Buchstaben!&quot; (&quot;sit down on your five letters&quot;), alludes to the vulgar use of the word &quot;Arsch&quot;, meaning &quot;arse&quot; (UK) or &quot;ass&quot; (US).
*Latin: a common insult used to be &quot;Es vir trium litterarum&quot;, meaning &quot;you are a man of three letters&quot;. The underlying implication was that the addressed was a &quot;fur&quot;, meaning &quot;thief&quot;, although if challenged, the speaker could always claim he simply meant &quot;vir&quot;, that is, &quot;man&quot;.
*Polish: the word &quot;dupa&quot; (&quot;arse&quot;/&quot;ass&quot;) is called &quot;cztery litery&quot; (&quot;the four letters&quot;). Historically, also &quot;kiep&quot;, which formerly used to be a taboo word meaning &quot;female genitals&quot;, but presently is a mild or humorous insult meaning &quot;a fool&quot; or a modern slang term for a cigarette. There is also a phrase &quot;Siadaj na cztery litery&quot; (&quot;sit down on your four letter&quot;), meaning &quot;sit on your arse&quot;.
*Russian: the word &quot;хуй&quot; (&quot;cock&quot;/&quot;dick&quot;/&quot;prick&quot;), the most common obscenity, is called &quot;the three-letter word&quot; (&quot;russ&quot;.: &quot;слово из трёх букв&quot;) or just &quot;three letters&quot; (&quot;russ&quot;.: &quot;три буквы&quot;) and is one of the key words of the &quot;Russian mat&quot;.

<text>The Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE) was a British professional organisation of electronics, electrical, manufacturing, and information technology professionals, especially electrical engineers. It began in 1871 as the Society of Telegraph Engineers. In 2006, it merged with the Institution of Incorporated Engineers and the new organisation is Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET).

Notable past presidents have included Lord Kelvin (1889), Sir Joseph Swan (1898) and Sebastian de Ferranti (1910–11). Notable chairmen include John M. M. Munro (1910–11).
== History ==
The IEE was founded in 1871 as the Society of Telegraph Engineers, changed its name in 1880 to the Society of Telegraph Engineers and Electricians and changed to the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1888. It was Incorporated by a Royal Charter in 1921.
In 1988 the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE) merged with the Institution of Electronic and Radio Engineers (IERE), originally the British Institution of Radio Engineers (Brit IRE) founded in 1925.

By the mid-2000s, the IEE was the largest professional engineering society in Europe, with a worldwide membership of around 120,000.

Discussions about a merger with the Institution of Incorporated Engineers (IIE) under a new name started in 2004, and following membership voting, the IEE merged with the IIE on 31 March 2006 to form the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET).

== Wiring Regulations==

The IEE was the publisher of the British Standard for Electrical wiring in the United Kingdom, BS 7671. This is now published by the IET.
