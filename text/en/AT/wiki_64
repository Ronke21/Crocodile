<text>Christina María Aguilera ( , ; born December 18, 1980) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and television personality. Recognized as an influential figure in music and having received widespread public interest, she is noted for her four-octave vocal range extending into the whistle register, artistic reinventions, and incorporating controversial themes into her music. Referred to as the &quot;Voice of a Generation&quot;, she was also named a Disney Legend, in recognition for her contributions to The Walt Disney Company.

After appearing on &quot;The All New Mickey Mouse Club&quot; (1993–1994), Aguilera recorded the theme song, &quot;Reflection&quot;, for the animated film &quot;Mulan&quot; (1998) and signed a record deal with RCA Records. She rose to fame in 1999 with her self-titled debut album, which gained three number one singles on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 – &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot;, &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; and &quot;Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)&quot;. Seeking a departure from her teen idol image, Aguilera took on a more provocative image and released &quot;Stripped&quot; (2002), which went on to become one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century. After another old-school inspired musical reinvention, she released the critically praised &quot;Back to Basics&quot; (2006). Throughout these periods, she amassed various worldwide hits, including &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;, &quot;Dirrty&quot;, &quot;Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Other Man&quot;.

During the early 2010s, Aguilera collaborated on a string of top ten &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hits, including &quot;Moves like Jagger&quot;, &quot;Feel This Moment&quot; and &quot;Say Something&quot;; the first of these topped the chart, making her one of the few artists to reach the number one spot over three decades. She has since performed in two concert residencies. She also starred in the film &quot;Burlesque&quot; (2010) and contributed to its soundtrack, earning a Golden Globe Award nomination. Her concurrent ventures included a role in the television series &quot;Nashville&quot; (2015), roles in films &quot;The Emoji Movie&quot; (2017) and &quot;Zoe&quot; (2018), becoming an ambassador for the World Food Programme (WFP), co-founding the company Playground, and serving as a coach on the reality competition show &quot;The Voice&quot; (2011–2016).

Aguilera is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with over 100 million records sold worldwide. She has been named one of the most successful artists of the 2000s decade by &quot;Billboard&quot; and was listed among the greatest singers of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

Her accolades include five Grammy Awards, two Latin Grammy Awards, six ALMA Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards, a &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Award, a &quot;Guinness World Record&quot;, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early life==
Christina María Aguilera was born on December 18, 1980, in Ocean Breeze, New York at Staten Island University Hospital, to Shelly Loraine (née Fidler) and Fausto Wagner Xavier Aguilera. Her father is an Ecuadorian emigrant from Guayaquil while her mother has German, Irish, Welsh, and Dutch ancestry. Fausto Aguilera was a United States Army sergeant, and Shelly Loraine was a violinist in the American Youth Symphony before becoming a Spanish translator.

Due to Fausto&#x27;s military service, Aguilera&#x27;s family moved frequently. She lived in Grasmere, New York before moving to New Jersey and Texas. In 1983, they moved to Japan and lived in Sagamihara for at least two years. During her youth in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, Aguilera attended North Allegheny Intermediate High School before leaving there to be homeschooled to avoid bullying she experienced at school.

In 1986, the family returned to the United States, and settled in Pennsylvania, where they welcomed her younger sister, Rachel, in 1986. Aguilera has spoken out about her father&#x27;s physically and emotionally abusive behavior. She noted that this is what made her turn to music, noting that, &quot;growing up in an unstable environment and whatnot, music was my only real escape&quot;. In 1987, Shelly filed to divorce Fausto and moved with Aguilera and Rachel to her mother&#x27;s home in Rochester, a suburb of Pittsburgh. She later married James Kearns and had a son with him named Michael. In 2012, following decades of estrangement, Aguilera expressed interest in reconciling with her biological father.

Aguilera moving to her grandmother&#x27;s home allowed her to explore her grandmother&#x27;s records, which featured mostly soul and blues singers and increased her interest in music. She also began to practice singing in public and competing in talent contests. Following numerous contests, she earned a reputation in her neighborhood as the &quot;little girl with a big voice&quot; and received widespread attention from local television and radio programs.

In 1990, she performed the popular song &quot;A Sunday Kind of Love&quot; on the reality competition show &quot;Star Search&quot;, but was eliminated during the semi-final round. Aguilera was eventually invited to sing &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; before Pittsburgh Penguins hockey, Pittsburgh Steelers football, and Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games, and at the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals.

== Career ==
=== 1993–1998: Career beginnings ===
In 1991, Aguilera auditioned for the television series &quot;The All New Mickey Mouse Club&quot; (MMC), which aired on the Disney Channel. She ran against 400 candidates, and while she made the shortlist she was ultimately rejected for not meeting the minimum age requirement. One year later, in 1992, Aguilera received a call from one of the show&#x27;s producers asking if she was still interested in becoming a &quot;Mouseketeer&quot;. She once again competed for a spot (this time, against 15,000 candidates) and was selected to join the variety program the following year. Her fellow cast members included Ryan Gosling, Keri Russell, Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, and JC Chasez. During the show recordings—which included Aguilera performing musical numbers and comedy sketches—she moved with her family to Orlando, Florida. In 1995, it was reported the series would not return for a new season.

Aiming to begin a music career, Aguilera moved to Japan in 1997. She was selected to record a duet with Japanese singer Keizo Nakanishi, with whom she performed in concert shows around the country. Their song, &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot;, was released as a single but failed to reach commercial success. In June 1997, Aguilera went on to Romania to represent the United States in a singers contest during the Golden Stag Festival, failing to win over the audience.

Seeking a recording contract, Aguilera recorded numerous demo tapes directed to record labels, including Walt Disney Records, for which she sent a cover of &quot;Run to You&quot; by Whitney Houston. She eventually was chosen to record &quot;Reflection&quot;, the theme song from the animated film &quot;Mulan&quot; (1998), which reached number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart. Following the attention she received with &quot;Reflection&quot;, Aguilera caught the ear of Ron Fair, the A&amp;R executive from RCA Records, who consequently signed Aguilera to the label. In late 1998, she began to record her debut studio album into which producers reportedly invested over $1 million worth of writers, producers and vocal lessons.

=== 1999–2001: Breakthrough with debut album ===
In May 1999, Aguilera released &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot;, the lead single off her long-awaited debut album, which topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for five consecutive weeks and became the second best-selling single of 1999. The song became an international success, increasing Aguilera&#x27;s popularity worldwide, topping the charts in over 20 countries. The single also attracted the attention of conservatives including celebrities such as Debbie Gibson that spoke out against its lyrical content, and was eventually considered &quot;too provocative&quot; to be sung by a teen idol. Due to the criticism, Radio Disney replaced the song with a censored version. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.

Aguilera&#x27;s self-titled debut album, &quot;Christina Aguilera&quot;, was released on August 24, 1999, to critical praise, debuting at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It catapulted Aguilera into fame globally and sold over ten million copies in its first year. It was later certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and it has sold over 17 million copies worldwide. Originally, Aguilera&#x27;s desire was to create material inspired by R&amp;B and soul, but the label opted for a more teen pop production due the genre&#x27;s high financial return in the late 1990s. At the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards, Aguilera won the Best New Artist category for which &quot;Time&quot; credited the award for &quot;[helping] certify her credentials as a real singer&quot;.

After the album&#x27;s release, &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot;, topped the Hot 100 and is recognized as the first new number one entry on the chart for the 2000s decade. The song was also nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. This was followed with &quot;I Turn to You&quot; which reached number 3, and &quot;Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)&quot; which became Aguilera&#x27;s third number one song and achieved worldwide success. She also released a cover of &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; in November 1999 which peaked at number 18 and became the second highest charting position of the song after the original in 1944.

In January 2000, Aguilera performed at the Super Bowl XXXIV halftime show alongside Enrique Iglesias, Phil Collins and Toni Braxton. In May, she embarked on her debut concert tour, Christina Aguilera in Concert, which toured North America, Latin America, Europe, and Japan until February 2001. Her success continued to rise with the release of her second studio album, , in September 2000 which topped both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Albums and Latin Pop Albums for nineteen consecutive weeks. The album featured Spanish-language versions of several songs from her debut album along with new songs, and had Latin pop themes. Three singles were release for the album including the Spanish version of &quot;Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)&quot; titled &quot;Ven Conmigo (Solamente Tú)&quot;, &quot;Pero Me Acuerdo de Ti&quot; and &quot;Falsas Esperanzas&quot;. The latter two were performed at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. The album went on to be the best-selling Latin pop album of 2000 and was later certified six times Latin platinum by the RIAA. &quot;Mi Reflejo&quot; also reached the platinum stats in Argentina, Mexico, and Spain. At the 2nd Annual Latin Grammy Awards, the album won Best Female Pop Vocal Album.

In October 2000, Aguilera also released her third studio album, &quot;My Kind of Christmas&quot;, her first Christmas album, which reached number one on the US Top Holiday Albums chart. The album received generally polarized reviews at the time but has since gone on to retrospectively receive praise. Aguilera starred in a holiday special, &quot;My Reflection&quot;, which aired on December 3, 2000, on ABC. Aguilera&#x27;s commercial success saw her being named the 2000 Top Female Pop Act by &quot;Billboard&quot;. The same year, she also filed a fiduciary duty against manager Steve Kurtz for &quot;improper, undue, and inappropriate influence over her professional activities&quot;. She eventually hired Irving Azoff to manage her career, aiming for control of her career and image.

On January 16, 2001, Aguilera featured on Ricky Martin&#x27;s &quot;Nobody Wants to Be Lonely&quot;, which topped charts internationally and peaked at number 13 on the Hot 100, becoming her fifth top-20 hit in the US. She was also listed as one of the most successful artists on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, Hot 100, and Mainstream Top 40 charts—for which the latter she was ranked among the greatest of all time. The song was ranked at number 65 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Love Songs&quot;, and was nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards. In April of that year, Aguilera featured alongside Lil&#x27; Kim, Mýa, and Pink on &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; from the soundtrack for the film, &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; (2001). The song received positive reviews and topped the Hot 100 for five consecutive weeks, becoming Aguilera&#x27;s fourth number one. The song also won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals and the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year.

In August 2001, Warlock Records released &quot;Just Be Free&quot;, a demo album recorded by Aguilera between 1994 and 1995 while she was looking for a recording deal following the end of &quot;The All New Mickey Mouse Club&quot; (MMC). She filed a suit against the label and the album&#x27;s producers aiming to stop the release of the album; however, both parties came to a confidential settlement to release the album, in which Aguilera lent out her name, likeness, and image for an unspecified amount of damages.

=== 2002–2004: New image with &quot;Stripped&quot; ===
With a new management, Aguilera started moving away from her teen pop niche and began working on a new project. She cultivated a new image by adopting the alter ego Xtina, dyeing her hair black, and sporting several tattoos and body piercings. Aguilera&#x27;s new persona was widely criticized by media outlets. In September 2002, she released the controversial song, &quot;Dirrty&quot;, which garnered mixed reviews and peaked as number 48 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song&#x27;s accompanying music video generated controversy for depicting overtly sexual fetishes, and attracted the attention of conservative organizations and moralists who sought to have the video banned on MTV. The video also sparked protests in Thailand and was eventually banned on the country&#x27;s local television. &quot;Dirrty&quot; topped the charts in the UK and Ireland, and has gone on to become a cult classic.
Aguilera&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Stripped&quot;, followed with a release on October 22, 2002. She also executive produced and co-wrote the majority of the songs.

== Artistry ==
=== Influences ===

Aguilera has named Etta James as a &quot;role model&quot;, and said &quot;At Last&quot; made a major impression on her. She later stated, &quot;I&#x27;ll still be as raunchy as I wanna be, and I&#x27;ll have [Etta]&#x27;s memory to back me up. She&#x27;s what I want to be someday&quot;. As a young girl, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1959) and its lead actress, Julie Andrews, became her early references to sing and perform, in addition to broadening her interest on Broadway. Aguilera&#x27;s other major influences include Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Billie Holiday, and Ella Fitzgerald. She has also cited rock bands as an influence, specifically the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nirvana, and Radiohead.

Aguilera was also influenced by Latin music. She later recalled singing her first songs in Spanish during childhood, saying: &quot;I grew up hearing [Spanish] being spoken in my household [and] hearing a lot of Julio Iglesias on the record player&quot;. Some of her other inspirations in Latin music include Chavela Vargas, Vicente Fernández, and younger artists such Rosalía. As a performer, Aguilera credits Madonna and Janet Jackson as major inspirations for being &quot;positive female artists [who] aren&#x27;t afraid to take chances, be daring, experimental and sexy&quot;. Cher also encouraged her to be a performer and &quot;a woman who has the guts to do [everything]&quot;.

Aguilera&#x27;s childhood visits to records stores moulded her taste and led to an appreciation for blues and soul music, which she called &quot;music that really had heart&quot;. Her music has also paid homage to many artists from this genre, including Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, Nina Simone, and Otis Redding. Her album &quot;Back to Basics&quot; (2006) features inspirations of musicians from the early 20th century. As she later commented: &quot;I was just so drawn to that [kind of music] ... [It] has so much pain, so much beauty of raw emotion and passion&quot;. Her other influences in the genre was added for &quot;Liberation&quot; (2018), including Michael Jackson in &quot;Maria&quot; and Janis Joplin in &quot;Sick of Sittin&#x27;&quot;.

Outside of the music industry, Aguilera was inspired by actresses from the Old Hollywood. She later stated, &quot;I&#x27;m fascinated with the golden age of film. I wanted to capture the authenticity of the glam era&quot;, after which she cited examples such as Marlene Dietrich, Marilyn Monroe, Greta Garbo, Veronica Lake, and the pin-up models. Her &quot;Tilt Ya Head Back&quot; music video also recreated Monroe&#x27;s signature look, while the video for &quot;Your Body&quot; includes a reference to Lucille Ball. The video for &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Other Man&quot; presented Aguilera under the alter ego Baby Jane, which was inspired by Bette Davis&#x27;s character in psychological horror film &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; (1962). Her other inspirations mostly came from art works, including those by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Banksy.

=== Voice ===

Critics have described Aguilera as a soprano, possessing a four-octave vocal range. She is also able to perform the whistle register. Maura Johnston, a journalist with &quot;Slate&quot;, called Aguilera&#x27;s voice &quot;an instrument that despite its ability to leap octaves has a low-end grounding similar to that possessed by opera singers&quot;. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; columnist Joan Anderman highlighted her vocal versatility: &quot;[She] is a real singer ... blessed with the sort of breathtaking elasticity, golden tones, and sheer power that separate the divas from the dabblers&quot;. In addition to sustain high notes, Aguilera is recognized for making use of the melismatic technique. Jon Pareles from &quot;The New York Times&quot; emphasized that &quot;she can aim a note as directly as a missile or turn its trajectory into an aerobatic spiral of leaping, quivering, and scalloping melismas&quot;. Ron Fair—A&amp;R executive from RCA Records—was impressed by her &quot;perfect intonation&quot;, and concluded: &quot;She&#x27;s got the pipes to be the next Barbra Streisand or Céline Dion&quot;.

Aguilera&#x27;s singing technique also yielded comparisons to other singers. Journalist David Browne suggested that, alongside Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, she &quot;forms the team of the main proponents&quot; of the melismatic technique. Richard Harrington from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; also noticed similarities with both artists: &quot;She has a genuinely powerful voice that&#x27;s evoked comparisons [to them], though it for the most part avoids those singers&#x27; ornamental mannerisms&quot;. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; columnist Sasha Frere-Jones also credited the technique by making her become &quot;a serious singer without needing to reincarnate the Sarah Vaughan&quot;. Songwriter Steve Kipner praises Aguilera&#x27;s vocal dexterity, including her ability to &quot;internalize[d] all the riffs from Chaka Khan&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; music critic Ann Powers wrote that she possesses a &quot;voice purely powerful as that of Etta James [...] and she&#x27;s moving toward the expressiveness of Gladys Knight, if not Aretha Franklin&quot;. Powers also associated her vocal ability with Donna Summer when she performs records influenced by rhythm and blues. &quot;Minneapolis Star Tribune&quot; noted that &quot;She has the best voice of the bunch — big, rich, soulful.&quot;

However, Aguilera&#x27;s has also been criticized for the frequent use of melisma, as well for her style of singing live during concerts. &quot;HuffPost&quot; columnist John Eskow called her &quot;the main proponent of oversouling&quot;. Eskow praised Aguilera&#x27;s voice as a &quot;great instrument&quot;, though complained she did not &quot;seem to know when to stop&quot; with the use of &quot;gratuitous and confected melisma&quot;. Lucy Davies, music critic from BBC Music, raved about her &quot;stunning voice&quot;, but offered that &quot;she could be more varied, simply by cutting out some of the &#x27;ye-e-eeeh, woah&#x27; in her songs&quot;. Writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Chris Willman credits Aguilera&#x27;s singing style as an influence of Mariah Carey, noting &quot;her slightly nasal tone that really only becomes obvious when she&#x27;s overselling a song&quot;. Alexa Tietjen from VH1 acknowledged that Aguilera &quot;does tend to take it to the extreme at times [...] but her vocal prowess is what&#x27;s gotten her so far. Love them or hate them, the riffs are a part of who she is as performer&quot;.

=== Musical style===

Aguilera&#x27;s discography is generally categorized as pop, contemporary R&amp;B, soul, and hip-hop. According to critics, she has also experimented with other musical genres in her works. In a 2008 interview, she explained that she is &quot;always inspired by new things&quot; in music and enjoys &quot;experimenting with [her] voice&quot;. Alexis Petridis from &quot;The Guardian&quot; considered the &quot;boldness in [continually] reinventing&quot; her music as &quot;one of her most impressive facets&quot; as an artist. Initially established as a bubblegum pop singer, she mixed teen pop and dance-pop on her first records, &quot;Christina Aguilera&quot; (1999) and &quot;Mi Reflejo&quot; (2000), with the latter also taking inspiration from numerous genres in Latin music.

Moving away from the teen niche, Aguilera&#x27;s post-2000 material mainly incorporated R&amp;B and hip-hop. Listed as an executive producer on &quot;Stripped&quot; (2002), she mixed both genres with Latin pop, rock, neo-soul, gospel, among others, while &quot;Back to Basics&quot; (2006) was described as a &quot;throwback with elements of old-school genres combined with a modern-day twist [and] hard-hitting beats&quot;. She continued merging R&amp;B with other musical styles on &quot;Burlesque&quot; (2010), as well on &quot;Liberation&quot; (2018), which also features hip-hop, soul and blues elements.

The show tune &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; is noted as Aguilera&#x27;s first musical transformation, which RCA Records initially felt was &quot;too urban&quot;. Despite the renewal in her repertoire, Aguilera continued producing power ballads—which became a signature in her discography—in between her uptempo material. Kelefa Sanneh, music critic from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, observed the continuous modification in her music, in addition to highlighting her &quot;decision to snub some of the big-name producers on whom pop stars often rely&quot;. Her sonically drastic ventures include the subversive &quot;galactic pop&quot; on &quot;Bionic&quot; (2010), electropop club on &quot;Lotus&quot; (2012), and Mexican ranchera numbers on &quot;Aguilera&quot; (2022).

She has also been noted for honouring her Ecuadorian roots throughout her career.

She has also heavily incorporated controversial themes in her music. Various themes include feminism, sexuality, defending the sex-positive movement, domestic violence, among others. Gerrick D. Kennedy writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; opined that Aguilera &quot;tackled subject matters her contemporaries were shying away from&quot; which made her stand out amongst her peers in the early 2000s. The impact of her videography, particularly the music videos for &quot;Dirrty&quot; and &quot;Beautiful&quot;, has also been analyzed by music critics.

<text>UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer) was a line of electronic digital stored-program computers starting with the products of the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation. Later the name was applied to a division of the Remington Rand company and successor organizations.

The BINAC, built by the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation, was the first general-purpose computer for commercial use, but it was not a success. The last UNIVAC-badged computer was produced in 1986.

==History and structure==
J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly built the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) at the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Moore School of Electrical Engineering between 1943 and 1946. A 1946 patent rights dispute with the university led Eckert and Mauchly to depart the Moore School to form the Electronic Control Company, later renamed Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation (EMCC), based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. That company first built a computer called BINAC (BINary Automatic Computer) for Northrop Aviation (which was little used, or perhaps not at all). Afterwards, the development of UNIVAC began in April 1946. UNIVAC was first intended for the Bureau of the Census, which paid for much of the development, and then was put in production.

With the death of EMCC&#x27;s chairman and chief financial backer Henry L. Straus in a plane crash on October 25, 1949, EMCC was sold to typewriter, office machine, electric razor, and gun maker Remington Rand on February 15, 1950. Eckert and Mauchly now reported to Leslie Groves, the retired army general who had previously managed building The Pentagon and led the Manhattan Project.

The most famous UNIVAC product was the UNIVAC I mainframe computer of 1951, which became known for predicting the outcome of the U.S. presidential election the following year: this incident is noteworthy because the computer correctly predicted an Eisenhower landslide over Adlai Stevenson, whereas the final Gallup poll had Eisenhower winning the popular vote 51–49 in a close contest.

The prediction led CBS&#x27;s news boss in New York, Siegfried Mickelson, to believe the computer was in error, and he refused to allow the prediction to be read. Instead, the crew showed some staged theatrics that suggested the computer was not responsive, and announced it was predicting 8–7 odds for an Eisenhower win (the actual prediction was 100–1 in his favour).

When the predictions proved trueEisenhower defeated Stevenson in a landslide, with UNIVAC coming within 3.5% of his popular vote total and four votes of his Electoral College totalCharles Collingwood, the on-air announcer, announced that they had failed to believe the earlier prediction.

The United States Army requested a UNIVAC computer from Congress in 1951. Colonel Wade Heavey explained to the Senate subcommittee that the national mobilization planning involved multiple industries and agencies: &quot;This is a tremendous calculating process...there are equations that can not be solved by hand or by electrically operated computing machines because they involve millions of relationships that would take a lifetime to figure out.&quot; Heavey told the subcommittee it was needed to help with mobilization and other issues similar to the invasion of Normandy that were based on the relationships of various groups.

The UNIVAC was manufactured at Remington Rand&#x27;s former Eckert-Mauchly Division plant on W Allegheny Avenue in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Remington Rand also had an engineering research lab in Norwalk, Connecticut, and later bought Engineering Research Associates (ERA) in St. Paul, Minnesota. In 1953 or 1954 Remington Rand merged their Norwalk tabulating machine division, the ERA &quot;scientific&quot; computer division, and the UNIVAC &quot;business&quot; computer division into a single division under the UNIVAC name. This severely annoyed those who had been with ERA and with the Norwalk laboratory.

In 1955 Remington Rand merged with Sperry Corporation to become Sperry Rand. General Douglas MacArthur, then the chairman of the Board of Directors of Remington Rand, was chosen to continue in that role in the new company. Harry Franklin Vickers, then the President of Sperry Corporation, continued as president and CEO of Sperry Rand. The UNIVAC division of Remington Rand was renamed the Remington Rand Univac division of Sperry Rand. William Norris was put in charge as Vice-President and General Manager reporting to the President of the Remington Rand Division (of Sperry Rand).

The following is a list of the General Managers/Presidents of the Division. There was a some degree of internal organisation turmoil from the period of the creation of Sperry Rand in 1955 right into the early 1960s. This culminated in the resignation of William Norris in 1957 and would continue until the early 1960s with the decentralisation of the former Remington Group and the promotion of UNIVAC to a full division of Sperry Rand. 


In the 1960s, UNIVAC was one of the eight major American computer companies in an industry then referred to as &quot;IBM and the seven dwarfs&quot; – a play on Snow White and the seven dwarfs, with IBM, by far the largest, being cast as Snow White and the other seven as being dwarfs: Burroughs, Univac, NCR, CDC, GE, RCA and Honeywell. In the 1970s, after GE sold its computer business to Honeywell and RCA sold its to Univac, the analogy to the seven dwarfs became less apt and the remaining small firms became known as the &quot;BUNCH&quot; (Burroughs, Univac, NCR, Control Data, and Honeywell).

In 1977, Sperry Rand purchased Varian Data Machines so as to enter the minicomputer market. Varian would be renamed as the Sperry UNIVAC Minicomputer Operation, operating as part of the Sperry UNIVAC division. Sperry UNIVAC would continue to market the V77 but never made a significant dent in the minicomputer market.

To assist &quot;corporate identity&quot; the name was changed to Sperry Univac, along with Sperry Remington, Sperry New Holland, etc. In 1978, Sperry Rand, a conglomerate of various divisions (computers, typewriters, office furniture, hay balers, manure spreaders, gyroscopes, avionics, radar, electric razors), decided to concentrate solely on its computing interests and all of the unrelated divisions were sold. The company dropped the &quot;Rand&quot; from its title and reverted to Sperry Corporation. In 1981/82 the distinct Sperry UNIVAC branding was dropped and the division was renamed as the Sperry Computer Systems Division. In 1986, Sperry Corporation merged with Burroughs Corporation to become Unisys.

After the 1986 merger of Burroughs and Sperry, Unisys evolved from a computer manufacturer to a computer services and outsourcing firm, competing at that time in the same marketplace as IBM, Electronic Data Systems (EDS), and Computer Sciences Corporation.

, Unisys continues to design and manufacture enterprise class computers with the ClearPath server lines.

==Models==




In the course of its history, UNIVAC produced a number of separate model ranges. One early UNIVAC line of vacuum tube computers was based on the ERA 1101 and those models built at ERA were rebadged as UNIVAC 110x; despite the 1100 model numbers, they were not related to the latter 1100/2200 series. The 1103A is credited in the literature as the first computer to have interrupts.

The original model range was the UNIVAC I (UNIVersal Automatic Computer I), the second commercial computer made in the United States. The main memory consisted of tanks of liquid mercury implementing delay-line memory, arranged in 1,000 words of 12 alphanumeric characters each. The first machine was delivered on 31 March 1951.

The Remington Rand 409 was a control panel programmed punched card calculator, designed in 1949, and sold in two models: the UNIVAC 60 (1952) and the UNIVAC 120 (1953).

The UNIVAC File Computer was first shipped in 1956. It was equipped with between one and ten large drums each holding 180,000 Alphanumeric characters. One early application was for an airline reservations system, which was used by Eastern Air Lines. It competed mainly against the IBM 650 and the IBM 305 RAMAC and a total of 130 were manufactured.

The UNIVAC II was an improvement to the UNIVAC I that UNIVAC first delivered in 1958. The improvements included magnetic (non-mercury) core memory of 2,000 to 10,000 words, UNISERVO II tape drives, which could use either the old UNIVAC I metal tapes or the new PET film tapes, and some circuits that were transistorized (although it was still a vacuum-tube computer). It was fully compatible with existing UNIVAC I programs for both code and data. The UNIVAC II also added some instructions to the UNIVAC I&#x27;s instruction set.

The UNIVAC Solid State was a 2-address, decimal computer, with memory on a rotating drum with 5,000 signed 10-digit words, aimed at the general-purpose business market. It came in two versions: the Solid State 80 (IBM-Hollerith 80-column cards) and the Solid State 90 (Remington-Rand 90-column cards). This computer used magnetic logic, not transistors, because the transistors then available had highly variable characteristics and were not sufficiently reliable. Magnetic logic gates were based on magnetic cores with multiple wire windings; unlike vacuum tubes, they were solid-state devices and had a virtually infinite lifetime. The magnetic gates required drive pulses of current produced by a transmitter-type vacuum tube, of a type still used in amateur radio final amplifiers. Thus the Solid State depended, at the heart of its operations, on a vacuum tube, however, only a few tubes were required, instead of thousands, greatly increasing reliability.

Sperry Rand began shipment of UNIVAC III in 1962, and produced 96 UNIVAC III systems. Unlike the UNIVAC I and UNIVAC II, it was a binary machine as well as maintaining support for all UNIVAC I and UNIVAC II decimal and alphanumeric data formats for backward compatibility. This was the last of the original UNIVAC machines.

The UNIVAC 418 (aka 1219), first shipped in 1962, was an 18-bit word core memory machine. Over the three different models, more than 392 systems were manufactured.

The UNIVAC 490 was a 30-bit word core memory machine with 16K or 32K words; 4.8 microsecond cycle time. The UNIVAC 1232 was a military version of the 490.

The UNIVAC 492 is similar to the UNIVAC 490, but with extended memory to 64K 30-bit words.

The UNIVAC 494 was a 30-bit word machine and successor to the UNIVAC 490/492 with faster CPU and 131K (later 262K) core memory. Up to 24 I/O channels were available and the system was usually shipped with UNIVAC FH880 or UNIVAC FH432 or FH1782 magnetic drum storage. Basic operating system was OMEGA (successor to REX for the 490) although custom operating systems were also used (e.g. CONTORTS for airline reservations).

The UNIVAC 1050 was an internally programmed computer with up to 32K of six-bit character memory, which was introduced in 1963. It was a one-address machine with 30-bit instructions, had a 4K operating system and was programmed in the PAL assembly language. The 1050 was used extensively by the U.S. Air Force supply system for inventory control (The Standard Base Level Supply System ).

The UNIVAC 1004 was a plug-board programmed punched-card data processing system, introduced in 1962 by UNIVAC. Total memory was 961 characters (6 bits per character) of core memory. Peripherals were a card reader (400 cards/minute), a card punch (200 cards/minute) using proprietary 90-column, round-hole cards or IBM-compatible, 80-column cards, a drum printer (400 lines/minute) and a Uniservo tape drive. The 1004 was also supported as a remote card reader &amp; printer via synchronous communication services. A U.S. Navy (Weapons Station, Concord) 1004 was dedicated to printing from tape as a means of offloading the task from their Solid State 80 mainframe, which produced the tapes. A design for an &quot;Emulator&quot; board was available that would allow the plugboard 1004 to run programs read from card decks. The board was made by the customers, not by UNIVAC. However, the Emulator made heavy use of the 1004&#x27;s program-branching reed relays, called selectors, which caused increased failures, later solved by the use of electronic selectors in the follow-on 1005.

 The UNIVAC 1005, an enhanced version of the UNIVAC 1004, was first shipped in February 1966. The machine saw extensive use by the US Army, including the first use of an electronic computer on the battlefield. Additional peripherals were also available including a paper tape reader and a three pocket stacker selectable card read/punch. The machine had a two-stage assembler (SAAL – Single Address Assembly Language) which was its primary assembler; it also had a three-stage card based compiler for a programming language called SARGE. 1005s were used as some nodes on Autodin. There were actually two versions of the 1005. The Federal Systems (military) version described above and a Commercial Systems version for civilian use. While the two versions shared common memory and peripherals they had two completely different instruction sets. The Commercial Systems version had a three pass assembler and a program generator.

The UNIVAC 1100/2200 series is a series of compatible 36-bit transistorized computer systems initially made by Sperry Rand. The first true member of the series was the 1107, also known as the Thin-Film Computer due to its use of Thin-film memory for its Control Memory store (128 registers). Delivery of the 1107 was late and this affected sales; the subsequent 1108 was considerably more successful, and helped to establish the series as viable competitors to the IBM System/360. The series continues to be supported today by Unisys Corporation as the ClearPath Forward Dorado Series.

The UNIVAC 9000 series (9200, 9300, 9400, 9700) was introduced in the mid-1960s to compete with the low end of the IBM 360 series. The 9200 and 9300, which differed in CPU speed and maximum memory capacity (16K for the original 9200 vs 32K for the other variants) implemented the same 16-bit modified subset of the 360 architecture as the Model 20, while the UNIVAC 9400 implemented a subset of the full 360 instruction set. This did not violate IBM patents or copyrights; Sperry gained the right to &quot;clone&quot; the 360 as settlement of a lawsuit concerning IBM&#x27;s infringement of Remington Rand&#x27;s core memory patents. The 9400 was roughly equivalent to the IBM 360/30. The 9000 series used plated-wire memory, which functioned somewhat like core memory but used a non-destructive read. Since the 9000 series was intended as direct competitors to IBM, they used 80-column cards and EBCDIC character encoding. Memory capacity started as low as 8K byte primary storage for a batch-configured system. Optionally a disk drive subsystem could be added, with 8414 5 MB disk drives as well as tape drives, using the Uniservo VI.

The UNIVAC Series 90:

* High-end: (90/60, 90/70, 90/80): The high-end Series 90 machines were successors to the high-end UNIVAC 9000 machines, but added virtual memory and thus were similar, or equivalent, to later IBM System/370 mainframes.
* Low-end: (90/30, 90/25, 90/40): Separately from the high-end series, Sperry Univac introduced the Univac 90/30 in about 1975 to provide an upgrade path for 9x00 users and to compete with IBM&#x27;s System 3. It used a disk operating system and had either a 300 or 600 lines per minute printer, a card reader, optionally a card punch, a console (Uniscope 100), attached disk drives that had removable disk packs, several 1,600 or 6,250 bpi tape drives, and an optional communications controller supporting up to 16 terminals (later 32) The standard disk drive was the 8416 which held a multi-layer platter removable disk pack that held approximately 29 million bytes. The 8418 drive was an enhanced version that supported both 29 MB and &quot;double-density&quot; 58 MB disk packs. These disk drives operated on the IDA (Integrated Disk Adapter). There was also an optional 8430 drive with a 100 MB capacity that operated on a separate high speed selector channel. Available tape drives were the Uniservo 10 (Mux Channel) and Uniservo 14 (Selector channel). The optional Selector Channel also enabled the use of other high speed devices such as the 1,200 lpm 0776 printer or the 2,000 lpm 0770 printer. The machine had either 4K or 16K memory chips, and typical machines had between 128 and 512 KiB memory. It ran an OS called OS/3, and could run up to 7 jobs at one time, not counting various OS extensions such as the print spooler and telecommunications access (ICAM). It was an upgrade path for users who had outgrown the IBM System/3. It ran Cobol-74, RPG2, Fortran, and Assembler. The instruction set of the 90/xx series was implemented in microcode and was loaded into control storage as part of the boot up process, before loading the operating system.

:Shortly after the 90/30 was introduced, Sperry Univac introduced the 90/25 which was the same basic hardware, however had an option for a smaller 80 column card reader and was a bit slower. The machine executed 3 instructions and then a NOP (no op) to slow it down, as nearly every component was identical to the 90/30). Later a 90/40 model was added, with improved performance from a faster clock rate (cycle time of 500 ns vs 600 ns), pre-fetching of the next instruction, and greater maximum main memory capacity (1M vs 512K).
* The Sperry UNIVAC System 80 series: The entire 90/xx series was eventually replaced in 1981 by the System 80, models 4 and 6. More powerful System 80&#x27;s (models 8, 10 and 20) were introduced in 1984. These were Sperry-badged, IBM/360-like mainframes actually developed and engineered by Mitsubishi in Japan. The final System 80 was the model 7E, released in 1990 by Unisys.

== Operating systems ==
The 1107 was the first 36-bit, word-oriented machine with an architecture close to that which came to be known as that of the &quot;1100 Series.&quot; It ran the EXEC I or EXEC II operating system, batch-oriented second-generation operating systems, typical of the early to mid-1960s. The 1108 ran EXEC II or EXEC 8. EXEC 8 allowed simultaneous handling of real-time applications, time-sharing, and background batch work. Transaction Interface Package (TIP), a transaction-processing environment, allowed programs to be written in COBOL whereas similar programs on competing systems were written in assembly language. On later systems, EXEC 8 was renamed OS 1100 and OS 2200, with modern descendants maintaining backwards compatibility. Some more exotic operating systems ran on the 1108one of which was RTOS, a more bare-bones system designed to take better advantage of the hardware.

The affordable System 80 series of small mainframes ran the OS/3 operating system which originated on the Univac 90/30 (and later 90/25, and 90/40).

The UNIVAC Series 90 first ran with Univac developed OS/9, which was later replaced by RCA&#x27;s Virtual Memory Operating System (VMOS). RCA originally called this operating system Time Sharing Operating System (TSOS), running on RCA&#x27;s Spectra 70 line of virtual memory systems and changed its name to VMOS before the Sperry acquisition of RCA CSD. After VMOS was ported to the 90/60, Univac renamed it VS/9.

<doc id="144175" wikidata="Q260440" url="?curid=144175" title="Sai Baba of Shirdi">
<text>Sai Baba of Shirdi (), also known as Shirdi Sai Baba, was an Indian spiritual master considered to be a saint, and revered by both Hindu and Muslim devotees during and after his lifetime.

According to accounts from his life, Sai Baba preached the importance of &quot;realisation of the self&quot; and criticised &quot;love towards perishable things&quot;. His teachings concentrated on a moral code of love, forgiveness, helping others, charity, contentment, inner peace, and devotion to God and Guru.

Sai Baba condemned discrimination based on religion or caste. He had both Hindu and Muslim followers, but when pressed on his own religious affiliations, he refused to identify himself with one to the exclusion of the other. His teachings combined elements of Hinduism and Islam: he gave the Hindu name &quot;Dwarakamayi&quot; to the mosque in which he lived, practised both Hindu and Muslim rituals, and taught using words and figures that drew from both traditions. According to the &quot;Shri Sai Satcharita&quot;, a hagiography written shortly after his death, his Hindu devotees believed him to be an incarnation of the Hindu deity Dattatreya.

== Biography ==

Most information about Shirdi Sai Baba comes from the &quot;Śrī Sāī Saccarita&quot; written by G.R. Dabholkar in Marathi (1859-1929). Dabholkar&#x27;s biography was influenced by the Vākarī Sampradāya and the Marathi &quot;Gurucaritra&quot; by Sarasvatī Gaṅgādhar.

=== Early years ===
Sai Baba is noted to have been born as a Hindu Brahmin before he was adopted by a Sufi fakeer. However, he himself gave no importance to the questions about his origins. Baba reportedly arrived at the village of Shirdi dressed as a faqīr in the Ahmednagar District of Maharashtra, India, when he was about sixteen years old. Although there is no agreement among biographers about the date of this event, it is generally accepted that Baba stayed in Shirdi for three years, disappeared for a year, and then returned permanently around 1858. This suggests a possible birth year of 1838. He led an ascetic life, sitting motionless under a neem tree and meditating while sitting in an asana. The Sai Satcharita recounts the reaction of the villagers.

The people of the village were wonder-struck to see such a young lad practicing hard penance, not minding heat or cold. By day he associated with no one, by night he was afraid of nobody.

Some of the religiously-inclined villagers (Mahalsapati, Appa Jogle and Kashinatha) visited him regularly. The village children considered him mad and threw stones at him. After some time he left the village and it is unknown where he went or what happened to him. There are some indications that he met with many saints and fakirs and worked as a weaver. He is reported to have said that he fought with the army of Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi during the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

=== Name ===
Sai Baba&#x27;s real name is unknown. The name &quot;Sai&quot; was given to him by the temple priest Mahalsapati when he returned to Shirdi in 1858. The word &quot;Sai&quot; refers to a religious mendicant but can also mean &quot;God&quot;. In several Indian and Middle Eastern languages the term &quot;Baba&quot; is an honorific signifying grandfather, father, old man or sir. Thus Sai Baba denotes &quot;holy father&quot;, &quot;saintly father&quot;.

===Return to Shirdi===

Around this time Sai Baba adopted the practice of dressing in a knee-length one-piece &quot;kafni&quot; robe and a cloth cap, articles of typical Sufi clothing. Ramgir Bua, a devotee, testified that Sai Baba was dressed like an athlete and sported &#x27;long hair flowing down to the end of his spine&#x27; when he arrived in Shirdi, and that he never had his head shaved. It was only after Baba forfeited a wrestling match with one Mohiddin Tamboli that he took up the &quot;kafni&quot; and cloth cap. This attire contributed to Baba&#x27;s identification as a Muslim fakir and was one reason for the initial hostility toward him in a predominantly Hindu village.

For four to five years, Baba lived under a neem tree, and undertook long periods of meditation. His manner was said to be withdrawn and uncommunicative, and he often wandered for long periods in the jungle around Shirdi. He was eventually persuaded to take up residence in an old and dilapidated mosque, where he lived a solitary life, surviving by begging for alms and receiving itinerant Hindu or Muslim visitors. In the mosque, he maintained a sacred fire (&quot;dhuni&quot;), and gave sacred ash (&#x27;Udi&#x27;) from the fire to guests on their departure. The ash was believed to have healing and apotropaic powers. He performed the function of a local hakim and treated the sick by application of ashes. He delivered spiritual teachings to his visitors, and recommended the reading of the Ramayana and Bhagavat Gita for Hindus and the Qur&#x27;an for Muslims. He insisted on the indispensability of the unbroken remembrance of God&#x27;s name (&quot;dhikr&quot;), and often expressed himself in a cryptic manner with the use of parables, symbols, and allegories.

Baba is believed to have tended a garden called Lendi Baug, named after a riverlet called Lendi which flowed nearby. The garden still exists; it contains temples (&quot;samadhis&quot;) commemorating people and animals associated with Baba&#x27;s life, and continues to be visited by pilgrims.

Some of Shirdi Sai Baba&#x27;s disciples became well-known spiritual figures and saints, most notably Mahalsapati, a priest of the Khandoba temple in Shirdi, and Upasani Baba Maharaj, who himself became the teacher of Meher Baba. He was revered by other saints as well, such as Bidkar Maharaj, Gagangiri Maharaj, Janakidas Maharaj and Sati Godavari Mataji. Sai Baba referred to several saints as &#x27;my brothers&#x27;, especially the disciples of Swami Samartha of Akkalkot.

In 1910, Shirdi Sai Baba&#x27;s fame began to spread in Mumbai. Being regarded as a saint with the power of performing miracles, and even as an avatar, numerous people came to visit him. They built his first temple at Bhivpuri, Karjat.

===Final years and death (Samadhi)===

In August 1918, Sai Baba told some of his devotees that he would soon be &quot;leaving his mortal body&quot;. Towards the end of September, he had a high fever and stopped eating. As his condition deteriorated, he asked his disciples to recite holy texts to him, although he also continued to meet visitors. He died on 15 October 1918, coinciding with the Vijayadashami festival. His remains were interred at Buti Wada in Shirdi, which later became a place of worship that is known today as Shree Samadhi Mandir or Shirdi Sai Baba Temple.

==Teachings and practices==

Sai Baba opposed all persecution based on religion or caste. He was an opponent of religious orthodoxy – Christian, Hindu, and Muslim.

Sai Baba encouraged his devotees to pray, chant God&#x27;s name, and read holy scriptures. He advised Muslims to study the Qur&#x27;an and Hindus to study texts such as the Ramayana, Bhagavad Gita and Yoga Vasistha. He instructed his devotees and followers to lead a moral life, help others, love every living being without any discrimination, and develop two important features of character: faith (&quot;Shraddha&quot;) and patience (&quot;Saburi&quot;). He criticised atheism.

In his teachings, Sai Baba emphasised the importance of performing one&#x27;s duties without attachment to earthly matters and of being content regardless of the situation. In his personal practice, he observed worship procedures belonging to Islam; although he did not engage in regular rituals, he allowed the practice of Salah, chanting of Al-Fatiha, and Qur&#x27;an readings at Muslim festival times. Occasionally reciting the Al-Fatiha, Baba enjoyed listening to mawlid and qawwali accompanied by the tabla and sarangi twice daily.

Sai Baba interpreted the religious texts of both Islam and Hinduism. He explained the meaning of the Hindu scriptures in the spirit of Advaita Vedanta, with a strong emphasis on the path of &quot;bhakti&quot; (devotion). All three of the main Hindu spiritual paths – Bhakti Yoga, Jnana Yoga, and Karma Yoga – influenced his teachings.
Sai Baba encouraged charity and sharing. He said:
Sai Baba stressed the importance of surrender to the true &quot;satguru&quot;, who, having trodden the path to divine consciousness, can lead the disciple through the jungle of spiritual growth. True devotees, he said, always meditate upon the &quot;satguru&quot; with love, and surrender themselves completely to him. When he spoke of himself in this sense he explained his meaning thus:You need not go anywhere in search of Me. Barring your name and form, there exists in you, as well as in all beings, a sense of Being or Consciousness of Existence. That is ‘Me’. Knowing this, you see Me inside yourself, and in all beings. If you practice this, you will realize all-pervasiveness and thus be as one with Me.

===Worship and devotees===


A local Khandoba priest, Mahalsapati Nagre, is believed to have been Sai Baba&#x27;s first devotee. In the 19th century, Sai Baba&#x27;s followers were only a small group of inhabitants of Shirdi and a few people from other parts of India. 

Today, because of Sai Baba, Shirdi has become a famous religious tourist destination in India and is counted as one of the most popular Hindu places of pilgrimage. The first Sai Baba temple is situated at Kudal, Sindhudurg. This temple was built in 1922. 

The Sai Baba Temple in Shirdi is visited by an average of 25,000 pilgrims a day. During religious festivals, this number can reach up to 100,000. Both the interior of the temple and the exterior cone are covered with gold. Inside the temple, the statue of Sai Baba is carved out of Italian marble and is seen draped with royal cloth, wearing a gold crown and adorned with fresh flower garlands. The temple is managed by the Shri Sai Baba Sansthan Trust.

Following rituals and traditions dating back to when Baba was still alive, four &quot;aartis&quot; are held daily (corresponding to the time of the day) inside the Samadhi Mandir. 

* Kakad Aarti &quot;(The Morning Aarti)&quot; at 04:30
* Madhyan Aarti &quot;(The Afternoon Aarti)&quot; at 12:00
* Dhup Aarti &quot;(The Evening Aarti)&quot; at 18:30
* Shej Aarti &quot;(The Night Aarti)&quot; at 22:30

The Palanquin procession of Sai Baba takes place every Thursday from the Samadhi Mandir to Dwarkamayi, onward to Chavdi and back to the Sai Baba Mandir. Devotees belonging to all faiths are welcome to take Darshan in the Samadhi Mandir and have free meals in the Prasadalaya, irrespective of caste, creed, and religion. 

Sai Baba of Shirdi is especially revered and worshiped in the states of Maharashtra, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Gujarat. 

In recent years, the following of Sai Baba has spread to the Netherlands, the Caribbean, Nepal, Canada, United States, Australia, United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Singapore, due to the Hindu Indian Diaspora in those countries.

===Hindus and Muslims===

In a verse of the midday arti, devotees sing:

Baba often talked about the Hindu gods and quoted from sacred texts. On occasion he would comment on passages from the Bhagavad Gita, the Isha Upanishad, and others. The names of Krishna and Rama were sacred to him. With Muslim followers, he talked of Allah and the Qur&#x27;an, often quoting Persian verses. He frequently used the expression &quot;Allah rakhega vaiia rahena&quot; (&quot;Let us be content with what we have, and submit our will to Allah&quot;). He told his listeners that he, like them, was but a devotee of Allah, a humble faqir with two arms and two legs. In later years, Parsis and Christians would also visit him in Shirdi. He respected all faiths, and taught that all are particular paths toward one ineffable goal.

His notion of the unity of all mankind was congruous with both Advaitism and Sufism. &quot;God being one and the master of all also meant that all his creatures were part of one big family,&quot; writes Sikand. &quot;This belief was entirely in keeping with both the Bhakti philosophy as well as the teachings of the Sufis, who believed that the light of God exists in every creature, indeed in every particle of His creation.&quot; For Sai Baba, it is commonly believed that he viewed all religious paths as being equally valid, with him considering &quot;Ishwar&quot; (the Hindu God) and &quot;Allah&quot; to be synonymous. People coming to his abode were so taken aback to see Hindus, Muslims, and others living together so peacefully that in many instances it proved to be life-changing.

==Followers==


Shirdi Sai Baba left behind no spiritual heirs, appointed no disciples, and did not provide formal initiation (diksha), despite requests. Some of Sai Baba&#x27;s notable disciples include Mahalsapathi, Madhav Rao (Shama), Nanasaheb Peshway, Bayijabai, Tatya Kote Patil, Kakasaheb Dixit, Radhakrishna Maai, Hemadpant, Bhuti, Das Ganu, Lakshmi Bai, Nanavali, Abdul Baba, Sapatanekar, Nanasaheb Chandodkar, B.V. Narashima Swamiji. Some disciples became well-known spiritual figures, such as Upasani Maharaj of Sakori. After the death of Sai Baba, his devotees offered the daily Aarti to Upasani Maharaj when he paid a visit to Shirdi twice within 10 years.

===Hindus===

The Hindu saint Anandanath of Yewala called Sai Baba a &quot;precious diamond.&quot; Another saint, Gangagir, said &quot;Blessed is Shirdi, that it got this precious jewel.&quot; Sri Beedkar Maharaj greatly revered Sai Baba and when he met him in 1873, bestowed the title Jagad guru upon him. Sai Baba was also greatly respected by Vasudevananda Saraswati (known as Tembye Swami). He was also revered by a group of Shaivic yogis, known as the &quot;Nath-Panchayat&quot;. He is considered an avatar of the &quot;Supreme Reality&quot; (Brahman or God), a satguru, or saint, depending on individual proclivities. This is not uncommon in Hinduism where there is no central doctrine or cosmology, but a basis in individual faith and spirituality.

===Muslims===
Abdul Baba was a close devotee of Sai Baba and was the caretaker of the shrine from 1918 to 1922. A large number of Muslim devotees used to come to the shrine until the 1980s.
===Parsis===

Shirdi Sai Baba was revered by prominent Zoroastrians such as Nanabhoy Palkhivala, Farhaad Panthaky, and Homi Bhabha, and has been cited as the Zoroastrians&#x27; most popular non-Zoroastrian religious figure.

Meher Baba, who was born into a Zoroastrian family, met Sai Baba in December 1915 and considered this event among the most significant in his life. &quot;Shri Sai Satcharita&quot; (Sai Baba&#x27;s life story) makes no mention of Meher Baba, but in &quot;Lord Meher&quot;, the life story of Meher Baba, there are numerous references to Sai Baba. Meher Baba declared Sai Baba to be a &quot;Qutub-e-Irshad&quot;, or the highest of the five Qutubs, a &quot;Master of the Universe&quot; in Meher Baba&#x27;s spiritual hierarchy.

==In culture==
===Sacred art and architecture===

There are many temples of Shirdi Sai Baba in India. Temples are also located in countries outside India, including the United States, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Fiji, Mauritius, South Africa, Netherlands, Kenya, Benin, Cuba, Canada, Pakistan, Australia, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan and New Zealand. In the mosque in Shirdi where Sai Baba lived, there is a life-size portrait of him by Shama Rao Jaykar, an artist from Mumbai. There are numerous monuments and statues, designed to serve a religious function, of Sai Baba of Shirdi. One of these, made of marble by a sculptor named Balaji Vasant Talim, is in the Samadhi Mandir in Shirdi where Sai Baba was buried.

In 2008, India Post issued a commemorative postage stamp of ₹5 to honour Shirdi Sai Baba.

===Film and television===
Sai Baba has been the subject of feature films in various languages produced by the Indian film industry.

<text>Sathya Sai Baba (born Ratnakaram Sathyanarayana Raju; 23 November 192624 April 2011) was an Indian guru. At the age of 14, he said he was the reincarnation of Shirdi Sai Baba and left his home saying &quot;my devotees are calling me, I have my work&quot;. 

Sathya Sai Baba&#x27;s followers have attributed to him a range of miraculous abilities, including the materialisation of &quot;Vibhuti&quot; (holy ash) and other small objects such as rings, necklaces, and watches. He was also believed to have performed spontaneous healings, resurrections, and exhibited clairvoyant abilities. Additionally, claims were made regarding his ability to be in multiple places simultaneously (bilocation), as well as his omnipresence, omnipotence, and omniscience.

Sathya Sai Baba&#x27;s devotees include members of all religions. In 1972, Sathya Sai Baba founded the Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust. Through this organisation, Sathya Sai Baba established a network of free, general, and super speciality hospitals, medical clinics, drinking water projects, educational institutions, ashrams, and auditoriums.

As his number of followers started growing worldwide, it raised concerns among some observers in the western world. In the early 1990s, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) created a secret report that stated the Sai Baba movement is “likely to eventually become another worldwide religion”. The CIA operative who wrote the report concluded it by stating, “there is always the possibility, too, that the movement will collapse if Sai Baba is convincingly demonstrated to be a fraud.”

Sathya Sai Baba faced numerous accusations over the years which include sleight of hand, sexual abuse, money laundering, fraud, and murder. However, he was never charged with any offence, and his devotees strongly reject these accusations, considering them as propaganda against their guru.

== Biography ==

===Early life===

Sathyanarayana Raju was born on 23 November 1926 to Namagiriamma (Easwaramma) and Peddavenkama Raju Ratnakaram, to a Telugu-speaking Bhatraju family, a community of religious musicians and balladeers, in the village of Puttaparthi in Madras Presidency of British India (present-day Andhra Pradesh, India). His birth was purported by his mother Easwaramma to be of a miraculous conception. He was the fourth among the five children of his parents.

Sathya Sai Baba&#x27;s siblings included elder brother Ratnakaram Seshama Raju (1911–1985), elder sisters Venkamma (1918–1993) and Parvathamma (1920–1998), and younger brother Janakiramaiah (1931–2003).

As a child, Sathya was described as &quot;unusually intelligent&quot; and charitable, though not necessarily academically inclined, as his interests were of a more spiritual nature. He was uncommonly talented in devotional music, dance and drama. From a young age, he has been purported to have been capable of materialising objects such as food and sweets out of thin air.

===Proclamation===

Almost everything known about Sathya Sai Baba&#x27;s early life stems from the hagiography that grew around him; these were narratives that hold special meaning to his devotees and are considered by them to be evidence of his divine nature.

According to these sources, on 8 March 1940, while living with his elder brother Seshama Raju in Uravakonda (a small town near Puttaparthi) 14-year-old Sathya was stung by a scorpion. He lost consciousness for several hours and in the next few days underwent a noticeable change in behaviour. There were &quot;symptoms of laughing and weeping, eloquence and silence.&quot; It is claimed that then &quot;he began to sing Sanskrit verses, a language of which it is alleged he had no prior knowledge.&quot; Doctors concluded his behaviour to be hysteria. Concerned, his parents brought Sathya back home to Puttaparthi and took him to many priests, doctors and exorcists. One of the exorcists at Kadiri, a town near Puttaparthi, went to the extent of torturing him with the aim of curing him. Having shaved Raju’s head, he cut three crosses on his skull, then poured acid into the wounds. At this point, his parents called a stop to it.

On 23 May 1940, Sathya called household members and reportedly materialised sugar candy (&quot;prasad)&quot; and flowers for them. His father became furious at seeing this, thinking his son was bewitched. He took a stick and threatened to beat him if Sathya did not reveal who he really was, the young Sathya responded calmly and firmly &quot;I am Sai Baba&quot;, a reference to Sai Baba of Shirdi. This was the first time he proclaimed himself to be the reincarnation of Sai Baba of Shirdia saint who became famous in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Maharashtra and had died eight years before Sathya was born. It was then he came to be known as &#x27;Sathya Sai Baba&#x27;.

Several months later Sai Baba, on 20 October 1940, told his parents that he had &quot;come to this world with a mission to re-establish the principle of Righteousness (Dharma), to motivate love for God and service to fellow man.&quot; Further elaborating in a letter (dated 25 May 1947) to his older brother Seshma, he stated &quot;I have a task to foster all mankind and ensure for all of them lives full of bliss. I have a vow to lead all who stray away from the straight path, again into goodness and save them... to remove the sufferings of the poor and grant them what they lack.&quot; Personally stating, &quot;I do not belong to any place. I am not attached to any name. I have no ‘mine’ or ‘thine’.&quot;

===First mandir and development of Puttaparthi===

In 1944, a mandir for Sai Baba&#x27;s devotees was built near the village of Puttaparthi. It is now referred to as the &quot;old mandir&quot;. The construction of Prasanthi Nilayam, the current ashram, began in 1948 and was completed in 1950. In 1954, Sai Baba established a small free general hospital in the village of Puttaparthi. He won fame for his reputed mystical powers and ability to heal. In 1957, Sai Baba went on a tour of North India, visiting temples in Delhi, Srinagar, Kashmir and Rishikesh.

===Stroke, prediction of reincarnation and sole foreign tour===

In 1963, it was asserted that Sai Baba suffered a stroke and four severe heart attacks, which left him paralysed on one side. These events culminated in an event where he apparently healed himself in front of the thousands of people gathered in Prashanthi Nilayam who were then praying for his recovery.

On recovering, Sai Baba stated, &quot;I am Shiva-Sakthi, born in the gotra (lineage) of Bharadwaja, according to a boon won by that sage from Siva and Sakthi. Siva was born in the gotra of that sage as Sai Baba of Shirdi; Shiva and Sakthi have incarnated as Myself in his gotra now; Sakthi alone will incarnate as the third Sai (Prema Sai Baba) in the same gotra in Mandya district of Karnataka State.&quot; He stated he would be born again eight years after his death at the age of 96, but died at the age of 84.

On 29 June 1968 Sai Baba began his only overseas trip to Kenya and Uganda, returning to India on 15 July 1968.

===Later years===

In 1968, he established Dharmakshetra or the Sathyam Mandir in Mumbai. In 1973, he established the Shivam Mandir in Hyderabad.

He inaugurated the Sundaram, a new ashram and temple in Chennai on 19 January 1981.

On 6 June 1993 there was an assassination attempt on Sai Baba&#x27;s life. While reports vary, the official narrative is that four men (devotees) entered Sai Baba&#x27;s residence under the premise of wanting to give him a telegram. When their path was obstructed, they stabbed two of the Baba&#x27;s assistants to death, injuring two others. Hearing the commotion Sai Baba sounded the alarm and police were dispatched to his residence. Upon arriving, the police report stated the four youths had locked themselves in Sai Baba&#x27;s living room and the officers tried to break the door down. &quot;The four were shot when they opened the door and attacked the police.&quot; Sai Baba remained unharmed during the incident, and later in a discourse cleared things up saying there was no bid on his life. Many aspects of the event remain unsolved and ambiguous.

Another concern for Sai Baba&#x27;s immediate safety arose on 17 January 2002 when an unknown man (later identified as Somasundaram) entered the Whitefield Ashram with an air pistol. He was apprehended by volunteers and handed over to police without incident.

In March 1995, Sai Baba started a project to provide drinking water to 1.2 million people in the drought-prone Rayalaseema region in the Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh. In April 1999 he inaugurated the Ananda Nilayam Mandir in Madurai, Tamil Nadu.

===Old age, illness and death===

In 2003, Sai Baba suffered a fractured hip when a student standing on an iron stool slipped, and the boy and stool both fell on him. After the incident, he gave darshana from a car or his porte chair. After 2004, Sai Baba used a wheelchair and slowly began to make fewer public appearances.

On 28 March 2011, Sai Baba was admitted to the Sri Sathya Sai Super Speciality Hospital in Puttaparthi after he complained of having giddiness and a slowing heartbeat. Initially, his condition improved, and on 4 April, it was reported all his vital parameters were near normal . However, over the course of the following weeks, multiple organ failures set in, and his condition progressively deteriorated. He died on Sunday, 24 April, at 7:40 IST, aged 84.

Sai Baba had predicted that he would die at age 96 and would remain healthy until then. After he died, some devotees suggested that he was referring to lunar years, as counted by Telugu-speaking Hindus, rather than solar years and using the Indian way of accounting for age, which counts the year to come as part of a person&#x27;s life. Other devotees have spoken of his anticipated resurrection, reincarnation, or awakening.

===Funeral and mourning===

Sathya Sai Baba&#x27;s body lay in state for two days and was buried with full state honours on 27 April 2011. An estimated 500,000 people attended the burial. Political leaders and prominent figures attending included then Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi (who later became Prime Minister of India), cricketer Sachin Tendulkar and Union Ministers S. M. Krishna and Ambika Soni.

Political leaders who offered their condolences included the then Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, then Nepali Prime Minister Jhala Nath Khanal and Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, whose birthday was that day, cancelled his birthday celebrations. &quot;The Hindu&quot; newspaper reported that &quot;Sai Baba&#x27;s phenomenal mass appeal lay in his unswerving commitment to communal harmony, his encouragement of charitable activity and public-spiritedness, and his own example in building educational and health care institutions that focused on meeting basic needs on a large scale.&quot;

Many spiritual figures expressed their sentiments at Sai Baba&#x27;s death. Mata Amritanandamayi said, &quot;Sri Sathya Sai Baba was the one who opened the path of love and compassion to millions of his devotees. Sathya Sai Baba’s life was his message.&quot;

Ravi Shankar, founder of the Art of Living Foundation, wrote that &quot;Baba will continue to live in the hearts of millions of devotees ... his message of &#x27;Satya Dharma Shanti Prema&#x27; which has transcended all barriers of caste and religion.&quot;

The Dalai Lama expressed shock over the death of Sathya Sai Baba. In a message he said, &quot;I am saddened by the passing away of Sri Sathya Sai Baba,
the respected spiritual leader. I would like to convey my condolences and prayers to all the followers, devotees and admirers of the late spiritual leader.&quot;

The Government of Karnataka declared 25 and 26 April as days of mourning. The state government of Andhra Pradesh (where Prasanthi Nilayam is located) announced a four-day state mourning period and decided to honour Sai Baba with a state funeral.

===Anomalies and possible unnatural death===

From the time Sai Baba was admitted to hospital on 28 March, questions and allegations arose about his care and subsequently the role of his personal aide, Satyajit Salian. Police sources said, &quot;Satyajit did not feed Sai Baba proper food and gave him lot of sedative drugs, resulting in the deterioration of the latter’s health, leading up to Sai Baba&#x27;s death.&quot; Doctors from the Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Medical Sciences, who treated Sai Baba, neither confirmed nor denied that sedative drugs were given to him prior to his admission to the hospital following respiratory problems. Later assessment from doctors noted lack of food had led to muscular weakness. Citing death threats and possible harm to his well-being from within the ashram community (after one of two trust members were allowed to sign cheques from a multi-billion dollar account), as well as from outside, a senior police officer said that Sathyajit was provided police protection.

On 10 April, direct relatives expressed wonder as to why they were kept in the dark and knew nothing about Sai Baba&#x27;s state of health. &quot;It is almost two months since Baba stopped taking food [but] we were not told about it.&quot; Family members said they were livid about the secrecy around Sai Baba&#x27;s health and medical treatments and as to why the trust was not allowing anyone direct contact with him except for Sathyajit, his personal attendant. They only saw him from a distance in the ICU on April 2 after raising a furore. It was on 28 March, when Sai Baba complained of giddiness and slowing of the heartbeat that he was taken to hospital.

On 21 April, the &quot;Deccan Herald&quot; reported an allegation stating that Sathya Sai Baba had died 20 days prior and that his death was not being announced in order to receive money from Indian and foreign devotees.

On 28 April 2011, four days after the death of Sai Baba, &quot;The Times of India&quot; printed a story questioning the time of his death. A business making freezer boxes said that the one in which Sai Baba was kept was ordered on 4 April, partial payment was also made at that time. The freezer box arrived in Puttaparthi on 5 April. Sai Baba was admitted to hospital on 28 March but his condition had officially worsened on 15 April. &quot;The order was placed by Rajendranath Reddy of Bangalore [and] according to sources, the powerful Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust had a role in ordering the freezer box.&quot; According to Lakshmi, the owner of Kumar and Co International (freezer box company}, her colleague Ganesh called Rajendranath to confirm the purchase for Sai Baba. &quot;He confirmed the same and told Ganesh not to discuss the matter with anyone.&quot;

Within two months of Sai Baba&#x27;s death, his niece Chetana Raju alleged that she was facing death threats from some trust members.

In 2015, Ganapathy Raju, Sathya Sai Baba&#x27;s first cousin, alleged that Sai Baba was murdered. He believes Satya Sai died on 29 March and not as officially declared on 24 April, saying that &quot;Baba was a victim of a well-planned conspiracy and pre-planned hi tech murder&quot; (adding) that the trust members had ordered a glass coffin and two truckloads of flowers even when Baba was unwell.&quot; Ganapathy also alleged that trust members were behind silencing the real date of Sai Baba&#x27;s death in order to buy time to &quot;usurp the huge wealth of the trust fund&quot;, asserting that properties worth hundreds of millions of dollars have &quot;changed hands&quot;. Dr Aiyar, Sai Baba&#x27;s personal physician, was heavily criticised for not maintaining any medical records of Sai Baba.

Ganapathy Raju&#x27;s main ideas of interest laid with the medical treatment and drugs given to Sai Baba, primarily by Satyajit Salian. Shyam Sunder, who had been involved with Prasanthi Nilayam since 1968, also raised concerns about harassment and exploitation from Satyajit as numerous allegations by devotees and workers in Prasanthi Nilayam arose saying that Satyajit would intimidate and physically abuse them. Like Ganapathy, Sunder also alleged that &quot;Satyajit and his associates had been administering sleeping pills to Sai Baba for over six years. Though Sai Baba resisted the pills after his return from Brindavan at Whitefield, Bangalore, in 2006, he was forced to take them ... and within a few months, Baba became sluggish and weak.&quot; Satyajit also controlled if and when the doctors could see Sai Baba, and within two days of Sai Baba&#x27;s passing, The Times of India reported that Satyajit (who was a paid employee of the ashram and &quot;had no say whatsoever in the trust affairs or activities,&quot;) was given authority to sign checks from the multi billion dollar trust account.

==Beliefs and practices of devotees==
Sai Baba was known for the quotes, in reference to his universal message, &quot;Love All, Serve All&quot; and &quot;Help Ever, Hurt Never.&quot; In Prashanti Nilayam, his devotees believed in seeking the spiritual benefit of Sai Baba&#x27;s &quot;darshan&quot;, scheduled for morning and afternoon each day, as a form of devotion. Sai Baba would interact with people, accept letters or call groups and individuals for interviews. Devotees considered it a great privilege to have an interview and sometimes a single person, group or family was invited for a private interview so they could ask for answers to spiritual questions or for general guidance.

Internationally, his devotees gather daily, or weekly on Sundays or Thursdays or both, for satsangs, spiritual discourses and devotional songs, prayer, spiritual meditation, service to the community (Seva), and to participate in &quot;Education in Human Values&quot; (SSEHV) known as &quot;Bal Vikas&quot; (Blossoming of the Child).

Devotees still receive Sai Baba&#x27;s Divya Darshan at his Mahasamadhi shrine, a white marble edifice decorated with flowers, in Sai Kulwant Hall (Prasanthi Nilayam), where he was laid to rest.

Sai Baba was a lacto-vegetarian for spiritual as well as moral reasons and his followers have adopted the diet. He stated that &quot;meat eating fosters animal qualities in man making him descend to the demonic level; it is a heart-rending sight to see cows being slaughtered to serve as food for man.&quot; Sai Baba and many devotees have heavily criticised factory farming as unethical.

==Ashrams and mandirs==

===Prasanthi Nilayam (Abode of Highest Peace)===
Puttaparthi, where Sai Baba was born and lived, was originally a small, remote South Indian village in Andhra Pradesh. It was here that Prasanthi Nilayam (Abode of Highest Peace) was established. After 2 years of construction it was inaugurated on 23 November 1950, Sai Baba&#x27;s 25th birthday. It succeeded the &quot;old mandir&quot; which was created in 1944. Prasanthi Nilayam is painted blue, yellow, and pink &quot;communicating the message of the harmony of spirit, intellect, and heart respectively; for blue stands for spirit, yellow for intellect, and pink for heart (love). The rich harmony of the three does result in Santi (peace) and Prasanti (supreme peace); and that really is the message of the Prasanthi Mandir.&quot;
In 1954 a free general hospital was constructed in Puttaparthi and soon after a medical hospital was constructed in 1957 inside the ashram.

Poornachandra Auditorium was built in 1973. Seating around 15,000 people in its enclosed 60 x 40-metre area, it is where cultural programmes (plays/dance/music), conferences and yagnas during Dasara take place. Sathya Sai Baba&#x27;s living quarters were upstairs above the stage area.

Sai Kulwant Hall was inaugurated by Sathya Sai Baba on July 9, 1995. The hall can accommodate up to 20,000 people and it was here that Sai Baba gave darshan everyday from that time forward. Sai Kulwant Hall is where Sai Baba was laid to rest. A white marble edifice stands as his Mahasamadhi shrine and devotees still have his Divya darshan here daily.

The ashram itself houses a shopping centre, book stores, library and reading room, multiple accommodations such as dormitories and rooms, banking/ATM facilities, media and Radio Sai facilities, a bakery, emergency medical services and three food courts – North and South Indian as well as Western canteens.

In the encompassing area around Puttaparthi there is an extensive university complex, a specialty hospital, and two museums: the &quot;Sanathana Samskruti&quot; or Eternal Heritage Museum, sometimes called the Museum of All Religions, and the &quot;Chaitanya Jyoti&quot;, devoted exclusively to the life and teachings of Sai Baba; the latter has won several international awards for its architectural design. There is also a planetarium, a railway station, a hill-view stadium, an administrative building, an airport, an indoor sports stadium and more. High-ranking Indian politicians such as the former president A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Andhra Pradesh former chief minister Konijeti Rosaiah and Karnataka chief minister B. S. Yediyurappa have been official guests at the ashram in Puttaparthi.

===Brindavan Ashram===

Established on 25 June 1960, the Brindavan Ashram is located in Kadugodi, a village close to Whitefield and 24 kms from the city centre of Bangalore, Karnataka. It occupies around 50 acres of land and was known as the summer home of Sai Baba as he would spend about three months here every year.
Notable features are Sai Ramesh Krishan Hall, where darshan and bhajans were held, Trayee Brindavan, Sai Baba&#x27;s personal residence and the Brindavan Campus of the Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning.
In its adjacent areas are the Sri Sathya Sai General and Super Specialty Hospital (Whitefield), Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Medical Sciences, Sai Central Trust and an old age home, Sri Sathya Sai Vriddhashram. All services at the hospitals are still free.

===Sai Shruti Ashram===

Located in Kodaikanal, atop the Palani Hills in south Indian state of Tamil Nadu, Sai Shruti ashram was often visited by Sai Baba for a few days in the months of April and May. It holds no accommodations or extra curricular facilities.

Sai Baba resided much of the time in his main ashram, &quot;Prasanthi Nilayam&quot;, at Puttaparthi. In the summer he often left for &quot;Brindavan&quot;, in Kadugodi, Whitefield, a town on the outskirts of Bangalore. Occasionally he visited his Sai Sruthi ashram in Kodaikanal.

==Recognition==

On 23 November 1999, the Department of Posts, Government of India, released a postage stamp and a postal cover in recognition of the service rendered by Sai Baba in addressing the problem of providing safe drinking water to the rural masses. Another commemorative stamp was released on the occasion of what would have been his 88th birthday during November 2013.

In January 2007, an event was held in Chennai Nehru Stadium organised by the Chennai Citizens&#x27; Conclave to thank Sai Baba for the 2 billion water project which brought water from the River Krishna in Andhra Pradesh to Chennai city. Four chief ministers attended the function.
==Sathya Sai International Organization==

The Sri Sathya Sai International Organization was founded in the 1960s by Sathya Sai Baba. Initially called the &quot;Sri Sathya Sai Seva Samithi&quot;, it was established &quot;to enable its members to undertake service activities as a means to spiritual advancement.&quot; In 2020, Sri Satya Sai Central Trust was granted Special Consultative status by the United Nations Economic and Social Council.

The Sathya Sai International Organization reports that there are an estimated 1,200 Sathya Sai Baba Centres in 114 countries. However, the number of active Sai Baba followers is hard to determine. Estimates vary from 6 million up to nearly 100 million. In India itself, Sai Baba drew followers predominantly from the upper-middle-class, the urban sections of society who have the &quot;most wealth, education and exposure to Western ideas.&quot; In 2002, he said he had followers in 178 countries.

Sathya Sai Baba founded a large number of schools and colleges, hospitals, and other charitable institutions in India and abroad, the net financial capital of which is usually estimated at 400 billion (US$9 billion). However, estimates as high as 1.4 trillion (about US$31.5bn) have also been made.
Sri Sathya Sai Baba&#x27;s 100th Birthday Celebrations have been commemorated by a specially designed logo created by the SSSIO. It is a humble and sincere effort to capture the uniqueness of Sri Sathya Sai Baba in this logo.

== Time line of developments, schools, projects and charities ==
In 1950 Prasanthi Nilayam, his Puttaparthi ashram completed construction and with in 4 years, a general hospital in Puttaparthi was established (1954). Over a decade later in 1968 the first education project, a college for girls was set up in Anantapur. The Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust, a charitable trust that undertakes social welfare projects and acts as an umbrella for many seva projects was begun in 1972. In 1976 another general hospital in Whitefield, outside of Bangalore was completed followed by a boys&#x27; college in Puttaparthi in 1978. The inauguration of the Sri Sathya Sai University (Puttaparthi campus), happened on 22 November 1981.

In 1991, Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Medical Sciences was completed.

The Anantapur drinking water project launched in 1995 would be the first of many water projects taken up by Sai Baba, others included the Medak &amp; Mahabubnagar drinking water projects (2001), the Chennai water project in 2002 and the East &amp; West Godavari water projects completed in 2007.
A decade later, another Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Medical Sciences began operations in Bangalore along with the Sri Sathya Sai Super Specialty Hospital in Whitefield, offering free medical services.
In 2009 the construction of Sri Sathya Sai University campus began.

Years after Sai Baba&#x27;s passing, Vivek Kumar wrote, &quot;the things that he executed were out of his love towards humanity. He provided free education, healthcare and water to people who never even dreamt of getting it.&quot;

===Classification of organisation===

Sources often describe Sai Baba&#x27;s following as a &quot;movement&quot;.
Sathya Sai Baba claimed to be the reincarnation of Sai Baba of Shirdi, whose followers considered him to be an avatar of Shiva. While Sai Baba of Shirdi was known to combine Islamic and Hindu teachings, Charles S. J. White, of The American University at Washington D.C., observed in 1972 that with Sathya Sai Baba, &quot;there is no discernible Muslim influence.&quot; Stephanie Tallings, in The Harvard international Review, noted Sai Baba&#x27;s following is drawn from people of all religions, ethnicities, and social classes. In contrast, Sai Baba&#x27;s following is also regarded by many scholars to be of a Hindu persuasion.

Lawrence A. Babb, of the Amherst College in Massachusetts, labelled Sai Baba movement as a cult in the 1980s, calling it &quot;deeply and authentically Hindu...&quot; and noted, &quot;The most striking feature of this cult, however, is the extremely strong emphasis given to the miraculous.&quot; However, a scholarly review says Babb misapplies the word &quot;cult&quot;, responding, &quot;the so-called &#x27;cult&#x27; of Satya Sai Baba seems to possess all such characteristics which are, according to the author, central to a religious movement.&quot; Deborah A. Swallow, of the University of Cambridge, referred to it as a cult and said that the &quot;ritual and theology, then, unlike Sai Baba [of Shirdi]&#x27;s, is distinctly Hindu in form and content.&quot; However John D. Kelly, a professor of anthropology at the University of Chicago, wrote about Hindu missions in Fiji that the Sathya Sai Organization (which is part of the movement) rejected the label Hindu. According to Kelly, they see their founder as the &quot;living synthesis of the world&#x27;s religious traditions&quot; and prefer to be classified as an interfaith movement. He observed that the Sai Baba mission is a Hindu mission that is as active as Christian or Muslim missions. In a 2001 scholarly book, Tulasi Srinivas notes, &quot;The Sathya Sai global civil religious movement incorporates Hindu and Muslim practices, Buddhist, Christian, and Zoroastrian influences, and &quot;New Age&quot;-style rituals and beliefs.&#x27; And in the appendix of the book (p. 349) lists 10 scholarly authors/researchers in both Europe and America who all refer to it as a New Religious Movement (NRM).

While scholars often refer to it as either a &quot;New Religious Movement&quot; (NRM) or as a cult, it has been noted by Eugene Gallagher, a noted professor of religious studies, that in more modern times &quot;&#x27;New Religious Movement&#x27;, is the classification preferred by most academics, who see &#x27;cult&#x27; as a pejorative term.

A secret report from the Central Intelligence Agency from the 1990s stated a &quot;worldwide mass religious movement&quot; was emerging around Sathya Sai Baba, who many devotees viewed as a full incarnation of God. On a local scale, the report states that the extensive appeal of Sai Baba&#x27;s doctrine &quot;of a harmonious, multi-religious and multi-ethnic India has the potential to counterbalance the appeal of Hindu chauvinists and ethnic separatists&quot; Globally, the report concluded that the Sai Baba movement is likely to “become another worldwide religion”, via its current wealth and assets, social contributions and activity in the political domain, thus allowing expansion even after Sai Baba&#x27;s death. Adding scope to the movement, the report addresses the claim that Sai Baba is the Kalki Avatar (the tenth Avatar of Vishnu) who is to &quot;create a new world of peace and justice&quot;, which the CIA operative compares to the return of Jesus Christ.

== Criticism ==
=== Accusations ===
Accusations against Sathya Sai Baba by his critics over the years have included sleight of hand, sexual abuse, money laundering, fraud in the performance of service projects, and murder.

In 1972, Abraham Kovoor made the first public criticism of Sathya Sai Baba when he looked into a claim publicly narrated by one devotee that Sai Baba had created a new model of a Seiko watch, and found the claim to be untrue.

In April 1976, Hossur Narasimhaiah, a physicist, rationalist and then vice-chancellor of Bangalore University, founded and chaired a committee &quot;to rationally and scientifically investigate miracles and other verifiable superstitions&quot;. Narasimhaiah wrote Sai Baba three widely publicised letters challenging him to perform his miracles under controlled conditions. The letters were ignored. Sathya Sai Baba said that he ignored Narasimhaiah&#x27;s challenge because he felt that a scientific approach to spiritual issues was improper, adding that &quot;Science must confine its inquiry only to things belonging to the human senses, while spiritualism transcends the senses. If you want to understand the nature of spiritual power you can do so only through the path of spirituality and not science. What science has been able to unravel is merely a fraction of the cosmic phenomena...&quot; Narasimhaiah&#x27;s committee was dissolved in August 1977. Narasimhaiah held the fact that Sai Baba ignored his letters to be an indication that his miracles were fraudulent. As a result of this episode, a public debate raged for several months in Indian newspapers.

Indian rationalist Basava Premanand, who began campaigning against Sathya Sai Baba in 1976, unsuccessfully attempted to sue him in 1986 for violations of the Gold Control Act, citing Sai Baba was &quot;producing gold necklaces out of thin air without the permission of a Gold Control Administrator&quot;. When the case was dismissed, Premanand unsuccessfully appealed on the grounds that claimed spiritual power is not a defence recognised in law.

A 1995 TV documentary &quot;Guru Busters&quot;, produced by filmmaker Robert Eagle for the UK&#x27;s Channel 4, accused Sai Baba of faking his materialisations. The clip from the film was mentioned in the &quot;Deccan Chronicle&quot;, on 23 November 1992, in a front-page headline &quot;DD Tape Unveils Baba Magic&quot;.

Claims of Sai Baba resurrecting American devotee Walter Cowan in 1971 have been discussed by British journalist Mick Brown in his book &quot;The Spiritual Tourist&quot; from 1998, and subsequently by Erlendur Haraldsson, who interviewed doctors attending Cowan at the hospital; these physicians reported that Cowan had been dangerously ill but had not died.

Brown also related his experiences with alleged manifestations of vibhuti (sacred ash) from Sai Baba&#x27;s pictures in houses in London, which he felt were not fraudulent or the result of trickery. With regards to Sai Baba&#x27;s claims of omniscience, Brown wrote, &quot;sceptics have produced documentation clearly showing discrepancies between Baba&#x27;s reading of historical events and biblical prophecies, and the established accounts.&quot;

The &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; in 2001 reported that Sai Baba told his adherents not to sign on to the internet, while encouraging them, rather, to surf the &quot;inner net&quot;.

===Allegations of abuse===
In January 2002, a documentary produced by Denmark&#x27;s national television and radio broadcast company, Danmarks Radio (DR), called &quot;Seduced By Sai Baba&quot;, analysed videos of public manifestations of Sai Baba and suggested that they could be explained as sleight of hand. The documentary also presented interviews with Alaya Rahm, former devotee of Sathya Sai Baba, where he alleged abuse by Sathya Sai Baba. As a result, in 2002 the parliament of the United Kingdom discussed the danger to male children of British families intending to visit the ashram of Sathya Sai Baba in case of individual audiences with the guru.

In 2004, the BBC produced a documentary titled &quot;The Secret Swami&quot; as part of its series &quot;The World Uncovered&quot;. One central theme of the BBC documentary was again Alaya Rahm&#x27;s sexual abuse allegations against Sathya Sai Baba. This documentary interviewed him together with Mark Roche, who had spent 25 years of his life since 1969 in the movement and alleged abuse by Sai Baba. The show also featured allegations from Sai Baba critic Basava Premanand. Premanand stated in the documentary that, in his opinion, Sai Baba faked his materializations.

===Posthumous Trust issues===

After Sai Baba&#x27;s death, questions about the manner in which the finances of the organization were going to be managed led to speculations of impropriety, with reports stating that suitcases containing cash and/or gold had been removed from his personal lodgings.

On 17 June 2011, officials from the Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust opened his private residence in the presence of government, bank and tax department officials. In the private residence, which had been sealed since his death, they inventoried 98 kg of gold ornaments, approximate value Rs 21 crores (US$4.7m), 307 kg of silver ornaments, approximate value Rs 16 million (US$0.36m), and Rs 116 million (US$2.6m) in cash. The cash was deposited into the Sai Trust&#x27;s account at the State Bank of India with payment of government taxes (thus transferring them from religious gifts to Trust assets.) The gold and other items were inventoried, assessed, and placed in secure storage. In July, district authorities inventoried an additional Rs 7.7 million (US$0.17m) in valuables in another 4 rooms. The total value of these items is believed to exceed 7.8 million US dollars. Also inventoried at Yajurmandir were thousands of pure silk sarees, dhotis, shirts, 500 pairs of shoes, dozens of bottles of perfume and hairspray, watches, a large number of silver and gold &quot;mangala sutrams&quot;, and precious stones such as diamonds. There were also 750 saffron and white robes of the type Sai Baba wore. In July 2011, a similar opening of his Bangalore-area ashram tallied 6 kg of gold coins and jewellery, 245 kg of silver articles and Rs 8 million in cash. These items and goods are believed to have been donated over the years by Sai Baba&#x27;s devotees from all over the world as religious gifts.

In 2012 Satyaji (Sai Baba&#x27;s former personal attendant) came forward with a noterised signed, yet unknown, document from Sai Baba, dated from 1967 entailing Sai Baba had &quot;no personal right on the multi-crore spiritual empire built by him&quot;. In the letter Sai Baba stated, &quot;Whatever is given to me is under my management, supervision and control as a trustee to be used for public charitable purposes. This declaration I am making so that nobody can claim, under or through me, in the family properties if any.&quot; Reports stated that for some time Sai Baba&#x27;s nephew, R.J. Ratnakar Raju was trying to gain control over the trust, whose assets and properties worth hundreds of millions of dollars, led to a conflict between him and the other trust members.
The Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust however, never makes the intake or expenditure details of funds into the trust public.
&quot;Nobody really knows who the members are in the trust and whether if; or any, changes are made at any point of time.&quot;

===Responses===
Sathya Sai Baba rejected any allegations of misconduct and was never charged with any offense. During a speech in December 2000, he used the analogy of Jesus Christ and Judas Iscariot, saying, &quot;in those days there was one Judas, but today there are thousands.&quot; Addressing the allegations, he said that out of jealousy, hate and fear, many devotees were being bought to speak against him, having been offered money to say nasty things.

His followers have also defended him publicly and attested to what they believed to be his character. These include Bill Aitken, and Anil Kumar, former principal of the Sathya Sai Educational Institute.

In an open letter in December 2001, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Chief Justices P. N. Bhagwati and Ranganath Misra, and Members of Parliament and Najma Heptulla said that they were &quot;deeply pained and anguished by the wild, reckless and concocted allegations&quot; against Sathya Sai Baba, and called him &quot;an embodiment of love and selfless service to humanity&quot;.

In a 2015 article, writer Paul William Roberts said Sai Baba &quot;definitely emanated love and could perform extraordinary actions defying explanation. No matter what is said about him, I can only speak for myself, and I have never had any reason to doubt that he is what he said he is.”

==Publications and documentaries==

Sathya Sai Baba authored 15 books, known as &quot;Vahinis&quot; (river or stream), originally written in Telugu and translated into English by Prof. Narayana Kasturi. His public discourses were collected and published into book form known as the &quot;Sathya Sai Speaks&quot; series. There are 42 volumes in total, beginning in 1953 and ending in 2010. During the summer months (from 1972 until 2002), Sai Baba gave discourses to his students at the Brindavan university campus in Whitefield. These were collected to create a 15 volume series known as the &quot;Summer Showers&quot; series.

There is a large known collection of Bhajans (spiritual songs) written and sung by Sai Baba as well as countless numbers of books about him written by devotees and critics.

Sathya Sai Baba has also been featured in various documentaries and films.

*1973 &quot;Advent of the Avatar&quot; by Richard Bock
*1974 &quot;The Endless Stream&quot; by Richard Bock who continued to make several documentaries about Sathya Sai Baba spanning from the 1970s until the 1990s.
*1975 &quot;The Man of Miracles: Sathya Sai Baba&quot; Narrated and hosted by Rod Serling of Twilight Zone fame.
*1975 &quot;A Glimpse into the Divine Mission&quot;

===Popular culture===

In a 1995 X-Files episode, &quot;The Calusari&quot; (season 2, episode 21), during a conversation about vibhuti (sacred ash) Sai Baba&#x27;s name is cited and mentioned. A fictious character, Dr. Burk elaborates, &quot;In 1979, I witnessed a guru named Sai Baba create an entire feast out of thin air.&quot;

<text>The [[Wye Valley]] Walk () is a long distance footpath in Wales and England following the course of the River Wye.

==History==
In 1975 the Wye Valley Walk opened with a stretch between St. Arvans and Monmouth. Further stretches were added, leading to it becoming a 34-mile (55 km) footpath by 1981. During the 1980s, gaps between Ross-on-Wye, Hay-on-Wye and Rhayader were integrated into the pathway, forming a walk reaching from near the river&#x27;s mouth at Chepstow in Monmouthshire, to Rhayader in Mid Wales.

In September 2002, the route was finally extended to start or finish in Coed Hafren, having passed within viewing distance of the source of the River Wye on Plynlimon near Aberystwyth, a total of .

==The route==

The Wye Valley Walk is marked out by circular yellow waymark arrows, finger posts, and signs showing the path&#x27;s logo, a leaping salmon. Most of the route follows Public Rights of Way. Some parts are permissive paths where owners have agreed for them to be used. Parts of Plynlimon are open countryside in which there is a right to roam established by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.

The route passes through Chepstow, the Wye Valley AONB, Tintern, Monmouth, Ross-on-Wye, Symonds Yat, Hereford, Hay-on-Wye, Builth Wells, Rhayader, and Llangurig to Plynlimon.

The route of the Wye Valley Walk can be broken into 17 stages, though the entire walk is often walked in seven day-length sections from Chepstow to Plynlimon, or vice versa.

<text>The breaking wheel, also known as the execution wheel, the Wheel of Catherine or the (Saint) Catherine(&#x27;s) Wheel, was a torture method used for public execution primarily in Europe from antiquity through the Middle Ages up to the 19th century by breaking the bones of a criminal or bludgeoning them to death. The practice was abolished in Bavaria in 1813 and in the Electorate of Hesse in 1836: the last known execution by the &quot;Wheel&quot; took place in Prussia in 1841. In the Holy Roman Empire it was a &quot;mirror punishment&quot; for highwaymen and street thieves, and was set out in the &quot;Sachsenspiegel&quot; for murder, and arson that resulted in fatalities.

==Punishment==
Those convicted as murderers, rapists, traitors or robbers were to be executed by the wheel, sometimes termed to be &quot;wheeled&quot; or &quot;broken on the wheel&quot;, would be taken to a public stage scaffold site and tied to the floor. The execution wheel was typically a large wooden spoked wheel, the same as was used on wooden transport carts and carriages (often with iron rim), sometimes purposely modified with a rectangular iron thrust attached and extending blade-like from part of the rim. The primary goal of the first act was the agonizing mutilation of the body, not death. Therefore, the most common form would start with breaking the leg bones. To this end, the executioner dropped the execution wheel on the shinbones of the convicted person and then worked his way up to the arms. Here, rhythm and number of beatings were prescribed in each case, sometimes also the number of spokes on the wheel. To increase its effect, often sharp-edged timbers were placed under the convict&#x27;s joints. Later, there were devices in which the convicted person could be &quot;harnessed&quot;. Although not commonplace, the executioner could be instructed to execute the convicted person at the end of the first act, by aiming for the neck or heart in a &quot;coup de grâce&quot;. Even less often, this occurred immediately from the start (from the head down).

In the second act, the body was braided into another wooden spoked wheel, which was possible through the broken limbs, or tied to the wheel. The wheel was then erected on a mast or pole, like a crucifixion. After this, the executioner was permitted to decapitate or garrotte the convicted if need be. Alternatively, fire was kindled under the wheel, or the &quot;wheeled&quot; convict was simply thrown into a fire. Occasionally, a small gallows was set up on the wheel, for example, if there were a guilty verdict for theft in addition to murder.

Since the body remained on the wheel after execution, left to scavenging animals, birds and decay, this form of punishment, like the ancient crucifixion, had a sacral function beyond death: according to the belief at that time, this would hinder transition from death to resurrection.

If the convict fell from the wheel still alive or the execution failed in some other way, such as the wheel itself breaking or falling from its placement, it was interpreted as God&#x27;s intervention. There exist votive images of saved victims of the wheel, and there is literature on how best to treat such sustained injuries.

The survival time after being &quot;wheeled&quot; or &quot;broken&quot; could be extensive. Accounts exist of a 14th-century murderer who remained conscious for three days after undergoing the breaking wheel. In 1348, during the time of the Black Death, a Jewish man named Bona Dies underwent the punishment. The authorities stated he remained conscious for four days and nights afterwards. In 1581, the German serial killer Christman Genipperteinga remained conscious for nine days on the breaking wheel before expiring, having been deliberately kept alive with &quot;strong drink&quot;.

Alternatively, the condemned were spreadeagled and broken on a saltire, a cross consisting of two wooden beams nailed in an &quot;X&quot; shape, after which the victim&#x27;s mangled body might be displayed on the wheel.

==History==

===Possible Frankish origins===
Historian Pieter Spierenburg mentions a reference in sixth-century author Gregory of Tours as a possible origin for the punishment of breaking someone on the wheel. In Gregory&#x27;s time, a criminal could be placed in a deep track, and then a heavily laden wagon was driven over him. Thus, the latter practice could be seen as a symbolic re-enactment of the previous penalty in which people were literally driven over by a wagon.

===France===
In France, the condemned were placed on a cartwheel with their limbs stretched out along the spokes over two sturdy wooden beams. The wheel was made to revolve slowly, and a large hammer or an iron bar was then applied to the limb over the gap between the beams, breaking the bones. This process was inhumanely repeated several times per limb. Sometimes it was &quot;mercifully&quot; ordered that the executioner should strike the condemned on the chest and abdomen, blows known as (French: &quot;blows of mercy&quot;), which caused fatal injuries. Without those, the broken man could last hours and even days, during which birds could peck at the helpless victim. Eventually, shock and dehydration caused death. In France, a special grace, the &quot;retentum&quot;, could be granted, by which the condemned was strangled after the second or third blow, or in special cases, even before the breaking began.

===Holy Roman Empire===

In the Holy Roman Empire, the wheel was punishment reserved primarily for men convicted of aggravated murder (murder committed during another crime, or against a family member). Less severe offenders would be cudgelled &quot;top down&quot;, with a lethal first blow to the neck. More heinous criminals were punished &quot;bottom up&quot;, starting with the legs, and sometimes being beaten for hours. The number and sequence of blows was specified in the court&#x27;s sentence (for example, in 1581, the serial killer Peter Niers, found guilty of 544 murders was, after two days of extended torture, given 42 strikes with the wheel, and was, at last, quartered alive). Corpses were left for carrion-eaters, and the criminals&#x27; heads often placed on a spike.

The &quot;Zürcher Blutgerichtsordnung&quot; (Procedures for the Blood Court in Zürich) dates from the 15th century and contains a detailed description of how the breaking on the wheel shall occur: Firstly, the delinquent is placed belly down, bound hands and feet outstretched to a board, and thus dragged by a horse to the place of execution. The wheel is then slammed twice onto each arm, one blow above the elbow, the other below. Then, each leg gets the same treatment, above and below the knees. The final ninth blow is given at the middle of the spine, so that it breaks. Then, the broken body is woven onto the wheel (i.e., between the spokes), and the wheel is then hammered onto a pole, which is then fastened upright with its other end in the ground. The criminal is then to be left dying &quot;afloat&quot; on the wheel and be left to rot.

====Dolle case; unclear case ====
On 1 October 1786 in the County of Tecklenburg, Heinrich Dolle was to be executed by being broken on the wheel, on account of the aggravated murder of a Jew. The court had decided that Dolle should be broken &quot;von oben herab&quot;: the first stroke of the wheel should crush his chest (traditionally thought to kill him instantly). The court instructed the executioner, Essmeyer, that Dolle should be clandestinely strangled (by garrotte) prior to the first stroke. The bystanders were shocked by what they thought was a severely botched execution by Essmeyer and his son and thought Dolle had been alive during the entire proceeding and also after Essmeyer had secured Dolle onto the wheel and raised it on a pole. The town physician climbed up on a ladder (the Essmeyers had gone by then) and ascertained that Dolle was indeed alive; he died six hours later.

The Essmeyers were taken to court for severe malpractice. It was established that the string around Dolle&#x27;s neck had not been drawn tightly enough, and that Essmeyer had, contrary to his duties as an executioner, accepted the use of a wheel that was not heavy enough. The inadequate weight meant that the chest had not been crushed. Furthermore, one of Dolle&#x27;s arms and one of his legs had not broken according to proper penal procedure. And finally the nail that was customarily hammered through the convict&#x27;s brain in order to fasten him upon the wheel had been hammered in far too low.
Many believed that Essmeyer&#x27;s act of malpractice had been not so much a display of gross incompetence as a deliberate act of cruelty because just prior to his execution Dolle had converted from Catholicism to the Reformed Church. (Essmeyer was a devout Catholic.) The court did not find sufficient evidence for deliberate malice on Essmeyer&#x27;s part but sentenced him to two years&#x27; hard labour and banned him from ever working again as an executioner. His young son was, on grounds of mercy, acquitted of any culpable wrongdoings.

===Indian subcontinent===
A long struggle between the Sikh community and Islamic rulers resulted in execution of Sikhs. In 1746, Bhai Subeg Singh and Bhai Shahbaz Singh were executed on rotating wheels.

===Scotland===
In Scotland, a servant named Robert Weir was broken on the wheel at Edinburgh in 1603 or 1604 (sources disagree). This punishment had been used infrequently there. The crime had been the murder of John Kincaid, Lord of Warriston, on behalf of his wife, Jean Kincaid. Weir was secured to a cart wheel and was struck and broken with the coulter of a plough. Lady Warriston was later beheaded.

===Colonial United States===
In New York, at least one slave was executed on the breaking wheel following their involvement in a failed slave rebellion in 1712. Between 1730 and 1754, eleven slaves in French Louisiana, who had either killed, assaulted or escaped from their masters, were killed via the breaking wheel. On 7 June 1757, the French colonist Jean Baptiste Baudreau dit Graveline II was executed on a breaking wheel in front of the St. Louis Cathedral in New Orleans, Louisiana by the French colonial authorities.

=== Kingdom of Hungary ===

At the end of the Revolt of Horea, Cloșca and Crișan, in 1785 (in the Hungarian Principality of Transylvania (1711–1867)), two of the revolt leaders, Horea and Cloșca, were sentenced to be executed by the breaking wheel. Crișan hanged himself in prison before that sentence could be carried out. According to a book published the same year by Adam F. Geisler, the two leaders were broken &quot;von unten auf&quot;, from bottom up, meaning the lower limbs were broken before the upper limbs, prolonging the torture.

===Russia===
The breaking wheel was frequently used in the Great Northern War in the early 1700s.

===Sweden===
Johann Patkul was a Livonian gentleman who was condemned on charges of treason by Swedish king Charles XII in 1707. The priest Lorentz Hagen was a friend of Patkul&#x27;s and described the horrors his friend had to endure when Patkul was condemned to be broken on the wheel:

===Later use===
The breaking wheel was used as a form of execution in Germany as recently as the early 19th century. Its use as a method of execution was not fully abolished in Bavaria until 1813, and still in use until 1836 in Hesse-Kassel. In Prussia, the punishment of death was inflicted by decapitation with a large sword, by burning, and by breaking on the wheel. At the time, the Prussian penal code required a criminal to be broken upon the wheel when a particularly heinous crime had been committed. The king always issued an order to the executioner to strangle the criminal (which was done by a small cord not easily seen) before his limbs were broken. The last execution by this stronger form of capital punishment, of Rudolf Kühnapfel, was on 13 August 1841.

==Archaeology==
Since victims&#x27; bodies of the breaking wheel were often left exposed to environmental influences over a long period of time, hardly any archaeological features for the &quot;breaking wheel&quot; exist; as a deterrence, the bodies were often left on public display over many years, exposed to wind and weather, birds and other scavenging animals could also take away the remains and bones. In the German-speaking areas, only a few archaeological discoveries of breaking wheel victims have been documented. In autumn 2013, the skeleton of a man was found in Groß Pankow, Germany, during the laying of Federal Highway 189 (&quot;Bundesstraße 189&quot;) between Perleberg and Pritzwalk in Brandenburg, whose position and signs of injury indicate death by the &quot;breaking wheel&quot;. Based on an iron belt buckle, the skeleton was dated to the 15th to 17th centuries. The identity of the man is unknown. A similar archaeological find has since also been discovered in 2014, in Pöls-Oberkurzheim, Styria, Austria.

==Metaphorical uses==
The breaking wheel was also known as a great dishonor, and appeared in several expressions as such. In Dutch, there is the expression , &quot;to grow up for the gallows and wheel&quot;, meaning to be destined to come to no good. It is also mentioned in the Chilean expression &quot;&quot;, &quot;to die on the wheel&quot;, meaning to keep silent about something. The Dutch expression , literally &quot;I have been broken on the wheel&quot;, is used to describe physical exhaustion and pain, like the German expression , &quot;to feel wheeled&quot;, and the Danish expression refers almost exclusively to physical exhaustion and great discomfort.

In Finnish &quot;teilata&quot;, &quot;to execute by the wheel&quot;, refers to forceful and violent critique or rejection of performance, ideas or innovations. The German verb (&quot;to break on the wheel&quot;) can refer to speaking incorrectly, for example with a strong foreign accent or with a great deal of foreign vocabulary. Similarly, the Norwegian &#x27; can be applied to art and language, and refers to use which is seen as despoiling tradition and courtesy, with connotations of willful ignorance or malice. In Swedish, &#x27; can be used in the same sense as the English idiom &quot;rack one&#x27;s brain&quot; or, as in German, to mangle language.

The word , meaning a debauched or lecherous person, is French, and its original meaning was &quot;broken on the wheel&quot;. As execution by breaking on the wheel in France and some other countries was reserved for crimes of particular atrocity, came by a natural process to be understood to mean a man morally worse than a &quot;gallows-bird&quot;, a criminal who only deserved hanging for common crimes. He was also a leader in wickedness, since the chief of a gang of brigands (for instance) would be broken on the wheel, while his obscure followers were merely hanged. Philip, Duke of Orléans, who was regent of France from 1715 to 1723, gave the term the sense of impious and callous debauchee, which it has borne since his time, by habitually applying it to the very bad male company who amused his privacy and his leisure. The &quot;locus classicus&quot; for the origin of this use of the epithet is in the Memoirs of Saint-Simon.

Another French expression is , which means giving a severe beating to someone.

In English, the quotation &quot;Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?&quot; from Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot&quot; is occasionally seen, referring to putting great effort into achieving something minor or unimportant.

==Execution of St Catherine==
Medieval hagiographies, such as the &quot;Legenda sanctorum&quot;, record that St. Catherine of Alexandria was sentenced to be executed on one of these devices for refusing to renounce her Christian belief, which thereafter became known as the &quot;Catherine wheel&quot;, also used as her iconographic attribute. It is said the wheel miraculously broke when she touched it; she was then beheaded. As an attribute it is usually shown broken in a small version beside her, or sometimes as a miniature she holds in her hand; the sword then used is also often shown.

<doc id="144187" wikidata="Q7978381" url="?curid=144187" title="Weavers' Way">
<text>The Weavers&#x27; Way is a long-distance footpath in Norfolk, England. Much of the Weavers’ Way footpath follows the old trackbed of the Aylsham to Great Yarmouth railway line, which was operated by the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway and was closed in 1959.

==Route==

The Weavers&#x27; Way runs from Cromer to Great Yarmouth. It passes through Hanworth, Aylsham, North Walsham, Worstead, Stalham, Potter Heigham, Thurne and Halvergate; it then crosses the marshes around Berney Arms and skirts the northern edge of Breydon Water where it shares the same route as the Wherryman&#x27;s Way.

The name &quot;Weavers&#x27; Way&quot; comes from the cloth industry that was once a major industry in the area before the Industrial Revolution.

At Cromer, the Weavers&#x27; Way links with the North Norfolk Coastal Path; at Great Yarmouth, it joins the Angles Way. Together with the Peddars Way, the trails form a circuit around Norfolk.

<doc id="144192" wikidata="Q1348219" url="?curid=144192" title="Koko (gorilla)">
<text>Hanabiko, nicknamed &quot;Koko&quot; (July 4, 1971 – June 19, 2018) was a female western lowland gorilla born in the San Francisco Zoo and cross-fostered by Francine Patterson for use in ape language experiments. Koko gained public attention as the subject of two National Geographic cover stories and, in 1985, the best-selling children&#x27;s picture book, &quot;Koko&#x27;s Kitten&quot;. Koko became the world&#x27;s most famous representative of her critically endangered species.

Koko&#x27;s communication skills were hotly debated. Koko used many signs adapted from American Sign Language, but the scientific consensus to date remains that she did not demonstrate the syntax or grammar required of true language. Patterson has been widely criticized for misrepresenting Koko&#x27;s skills, providing insufficient care for Koko and her companion gorillas, and inappropriate treatment of Gorilla Foundation staff members.

Despite such controversies, Koko&#x27;s story changed the public image of gorillas, previously assumed to be brainless and violent. &quot;Science&quot; noted in its obituary that Koko &quot;helped transform how the human world viewed animal emotion—and intelligence.&quot;

==Early life and popularity==
Koko was born on July 4, 1971, at the San Francisco Zoo to her mother Jacqueline and father Bwana. (The name , , is of Japanese origin and is a reference to her date of birth, the Fourth of July.) Koko remained with her mother until December, when she was hospitalized due to malnutrition, then hand-tended in the zookeeper&#x27;s home.

Patterson originally cared for Koko at the San Francisco Zoo as part of her doctoral research at Stanford University. Up through June 1973, she conducted sign language lessons with Koko from the Children&#x27;s Zoo exhibit. The environment was noisy and distracting, so Patterson and her life partner Ron Cohn purchased a trailer in which they could conduct Koko&#x27;s signing sessions.

Around this time, Patterson realized that conflict with the zoo was &quot;inevitable&quot;. She started the project on the condition that Koko would be reunited with her gorilla colony after a few years. Gorillas are social animals and suffer when isolated from their species. And, as gorillas are endangered, the zoo expected to breed Koko. But Patterson felt that she had become Koko&#x27;s &quot;mother&quot; and convinced the zoo to let her move the gorilla to Stanford.

Once at Stanford, Patterson worked to wrest custody of Koko from San Francisco Zoo. Patterson found an exotic species dealer who sold her two infant gorillas that she suspected were illegally &quot;harvested&quot; (a process that involves killing the mother and any surrounding adults). Her plan was to give the female to the zoo as a replacement for Koko and keep the male as a playmate. But the female died within a month. Only the male, Michael, survived.

Stuck without a viable trade for the zoo, Patterson launched a &quot;Save Koko&quot; press campaign, telling reporters that if Koko had to go back to the zoo, she may sink into depression, refuse to eat, and possibly die. The Save Koko campaign generated $3,000 in donations and, with additional funds from a wealthy benefactor, allowed Patterson to maintain custody of Koko. Around this time, Patterson founded (with Ron Cohn and lawyer Edward Fitzsimmons) the nonprofit Gorilla Foundation.

=== &quot;Koko&#x27;s Kitten&quot; ===
In 1978, Koko gained worldwide attention when she was pictured on the cover of &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine. The cover was a photo of Koko taking her own picture in the mirror. Koko was later featured on the cover of &quot;National Geographic&quot; in 1985 with a picture of her and her kitten, All Ball.

In 1985, Scholastic Inc. published &quot;Koko&#x27;s Kitten&quot;, a children&#x27;s picture book based on the &quot;National Geographic&quot; story. The book was favorably reviewed and became one of Scholastic&#x27;s best sellers. Written by Patterson, it describes Koko&#x27;s yearning for a cat, her adoption of All Ball, and Koko&#x27;s sadness after the kitten is hit by a car and killed. The story is peppered throughout with Koko&#x27;s signs such as &quot;cry&quot;, &quot;sleep&quot; and &quot;cat&quot;. &quot;Koko&#x27;s Kitten&quot; is still in print.

==Characteristics==
===Use of language and controversy===

Francine Patterson published a few peer-reviewed studies on her work with Koko in the late 1970s. She demonstrated that Koko was able to communicate using a number of signs adapted from American Sign Language. Gorillas have thick, stubby fingers and hands that move differently than humans, so Koko was unable to make some ASL signs. Francine Patterson used the term &quot;Gorilla Sign Language&quot; to refer to Koko&#x27;s adaptations.

Patterson reported that Koko invented new signs to communicate novel thoughts. For example, she said that nobody taught Koko the word for &quot;ring&quot;, so Koko combined the words &quot;finger&quot; and &quot;bracelet&quot;, hence &quot;finger-bracelet&quot;. This type of claim was seen as a typical problem with Patterson&#x27;s methodology, as it relies on a human interpreter of Koko&#x27;s intentions.

In 1979, Herbert S. Terrace published the negative results of his Nim Chimpsky study, which presented evidence that Koko was mimicking her trainers. Terrace&#x27;s article ignited intense debate over the ape language experiments (see &quot;Scientific criticism&quot; below), culminating in the 1980 &quot;Clever Hans&quot; conference that mocked the other researchers involved. Funding for the ape language experiments disappeared seemingly overnight.

While other scientists severed ties with their apes after funding dried up, Patterson maintained responsibility for Koko. (For example, most of the chimps who worked with Terrace, as well as with the Gardners, were sold to medical labs for use in testing.) Though Patterson had initially defended her scientific work, she turned her focus away from science and toward securing revenue for the upkeep of Koko and Michael. Her work involved fund-raising, PR campaigns, and managing Gorilla Foundation caregiving staff. After 1978, Patterson and Koko had no affiliation with any university or government funding.

===Scientific criticism===
Francine Patterson&#x27;s published research received a variety of criticisms from the scientific community. Herbert S. Terrace and Laura-Ann Petitto, researchers who worked with Nim Chimpsky, issued critical evaluations of Patterson&#x27;s reports and suggested that Koko was simply being prompted by her trainers&#x27; unconscious cues to display specific signs. Terrace and Petitto questioned Patterson&#x27;s interpretations of Koko&#x27;s signing and her claims of grammatical competency, asking for more rigorous testing. (Terrace and Petitto reported negative results in their Nim study, which was itself criticized on methodological grounds.) Other researchers argued that Koko did not understand the meaning behind what she was doing and learned to complete the signs simply because the researchers rewarded her for doing so (indicating that her actions were the product of operant conditioning). Another concern was that interpretation of the gorilla&#x27;s conversation was left to the handler, who may have seen improbable concatenations of signs as meaningful; for example, when Koko signed &quot;sad&quot; there was no way to tell whether she meant it with the connotation of &quot;How sad.&quot; Patterson defended her research, stating that blind and double-blind experiments had been administered to evaluate the gorillas&#x27; comprehension, that the gorillas were able to sign spontaneously to each other and to strangers without the prompting of a trainer, and that they signed meaningfully the majority of the time.

Later critics noted that Patterson used Koko in deceptive ways in popular media. These concerns were echoed privately by staff at the Gorilla Foundation, where turnover was high. Some, like research assistant Anne Southecomb, expressed concerns that Patterson&#x27;s exaggerated claims and &quot;over-interpretation&quot; undermined and disvalued their work. (Southcombe left to work with orangutan Chantek on a research project she preferred.) Sign language expert Sherman Wilcox, for example, characterized the Foundation&#x27;s edited clips of Koko making a &quot;climate speech&quot; as deceptive and &quot;disrespectful of ASL&quot;. Wilcox expressed concerns that the bit would reinforce the perception that ASL is &quot;only words and no syntax&quot;.

Eugene Linden, a journalist who spent years studying apes involved in language experiments and co-wrote (with Patterson) &quot;The Education of Koko&quot;, also expressed concerns about Patterson&#x27;s practices. Linden reported that Koko&#x27;s signing was more fluid and precise than that of Washoe and other Oklahoma chimpanzees. She was also by nature less impulsive; though, like the chimps, she frequently refused to participate in language drills. When not pushed to perform or stressed by strangers, &quot;the amount of signing by Koko seemed to me to overwhelm [Patterson&#x27;s] capacity to digest and analyze it,&quot; Linden wrote. But in Linden&#x27;s view, Patterson&#x27;s exaggerated claims, &quot;bunker mentality&quot;, refusal to provide researchers access to Koko, and unwillingness to open up the data she had collected minimized Koko&#x27;s impact.

Ultimately, critics of Patterson&#x27;s claims acknowledged that Koko had learned a number of signs and used them to communicate her wants. But this did not mean that Koko &quot;spoke&quot; sign language, which requires a grasp of syntax and grammatical sentences. Experts generally agreed that Koko&#x27;s use of sentences was unsupported by evidence.

=== Care practices criticism ===
Former employees of The Gorilla Foundation criticized the methods used to care for Koko and her male companion Ndume. In 2012, nine staff members including caregivers and researchers out of &quot;roughly a dozen&quot; resigned, and several submitted a letter to the board to explain their concerns. Former caregiver John Safkow stated that all members of the board left after the walkout, except for Betty White. A pseudonymous source, &quot;Sarah&quot;, told &quot;Slate&quot; that Koko&#x27;s diet included an excess of processed meat and candy, and that Koko was given a traditional Thanksgiving dinner yearly. The source stated that the official diet they were told to give Koko was appropriate, but that Patterson would visit and feed her &quot;chocolates and meats&quot;. Koko&#x27;s weight of was higher than would be normal for a female gorilla in the wild, approximately ; the foundation stated that Koko &quot;is, like her mother, a larger frame Gorilla.&quot; Multiple employees corroborated the claim that both Koko and Ndume were given &quot;massive&quot; numbers of supplements on the recommendation of a naturopath; Safkow recalled that the number was between 70 and 100 pills per day, and &quot;Sarah&quot; claimed that various inappropriate foods like smoked turkey, pea soup, non-alcoholic beer, and candy were used as treats to coax Koko to take the pills. The Gorilla Foundation stated that Koko took &quot;between 5 to 15 types of nutritional supplements&quot; and acknowledged their use of homeopathic remedies.

Several former caregivers at The Gorilla Foundation also raised concerns that Koko&#x27;s companion Ndume was being neglected. In 2012, a group of former employees reached out to a blogger who focused on the ape caregiver community, who in turn asked the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to follow up on the claims. After an investigation, APHIS reported that Ndume had been neglected in some aspects; for instance, he had not been tested for tuberculosis in 20 years, despite the recommendation being to test gorillas for tuberculosis yearly.

In the 2010s, as Koko neared the end of her life, anthropologist and primatologist Barbara J. King questioned the ethics of Patterson&#x27;s caretaking decisions, and criticized the foundation for excessively anthropomorphizing Koko.

===Nipple fixation and lawsuit===
Like other apes raised by humans (Lucy, Washoe), Koko did not develop the sexual instincts of an ape raised in the wild. According to Patterson, she developed several crushes on human men. For example, Koko &quot;maintained a near-constant vigil by the trailer window&quot; when a favorite workman was expected to show—and blew him kisses after he arrived. Though Patterson secured male gorillas Michael and Ndume for Koko to mate with, she was not sexually interested in them. (As a result, Ndume was caged separately, in isolation.)

Koko was reported to have a preoccupation with human nipples, likely a result of her disconnect from other gorillas. In 2005, three female staff members at The Gorilla Foundation, where Koko resided, filed lawsuits against the organization, alleging that they were pressured to reveal their nipples to Koko by the organization&#x27;s executive director, Francine Patterson, among other violations of labor law. The lawsuit alleged that in response to signing from Koko, Patterson pressured Keller and Alperin (two of the female staff) to flash the ape. &quot;Oh, yes, Koko, Nancy has nipples. Nancy can show you her nipples,&quot; Patterson reportedly said on one occasion. And on another: &quot;Koko, you see my nipples all the time. You are probably bored with my nipples. You need to see new nipples. I will turn my back so Kendra can show you her nipples.&quot; Shortly thereafter, a third woman filed suit, alleging that upon being first introduced to Koko, Patterson told her that Koko was communicating that she wanted to see the woman&#x27;s nipples, pressuring her to submit to Koko&#x27;s demands and informing her that &quot;everyone does it for her around here.&quot; When the woman briefly lifted her t-shirt, flashing her undergarments, Patterson admonished the woman and reiterated that Koko wanted to see her nipples. When the woman relented and showed her breasts to Koko, Patterson commented &quot;Oh look, Koko, she has big nipples.&quot; On another occasion, one of the gorilla&#x27;s handlers told the woman that Koko wanted to be alone with her. When the woman went to Koko&#x27;s enclosure, Koko begin to squat and breathe heavily. The lawsuits were settled out of court.

When asked to comment on the matter, gorilla expert Kristen Lukas said that other gorillas are not known to have had a similar nipple fixation. A former caregiver stated that Patterson would interpret the sign for &quot;nipple&quot; as a sound-alike, &quot;people&quot;, when notable donors were present.

==Later life and death==
After Patterson&#x27;s research with Koko was completed, the gorilla moved to a reserve in Woodside, California. At the reserve, Koko lived with another gorilla, Michael, but he died in 2000. She then lived with another male gorilla, Ndume, until her death.

At the preserve, Koko also met and interacted with a variety of celebrities, including Robin Williams, Fred Rogers, Betty White, William Shatner, Flea, Leonardo DiCaprio, Peter Gabriel, and Sting.

Koko died in her sleep during the morning of June 19, 2018, at the Gorilla Foundation&#x27;s preserve in Woodside, California, at the age of 46. The Gorilla Foundation released a statement that &quot;The impact has been profound and what she has taught us about the emotional capacity of gorillas and their cognitive abilities will continue to shape the world.&quot; Despite her comparatively old age, her death took staff members of the Gorilla Foundation by surprise. Ndume was transferred to the Cincinnati Zoo after a lengthy legal battle.

<text>The Norfolk Coast Path is a long-distance footpath in Norfolk, running 83 miles (133.5 km) from Hunstanton to Hopton-on-Sea. It was opened in 1986 and covers the North Norfolk Coast AONB (Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty). It is now part of the King Charles III England Coast Path.

It links with the Peddars Way at Holme-next-the-Sea, and the two in combination form the Peddars Way &amp; Norfolk Coast Path National Trail, one of 15 National Trails in England and Wales. It links to the Angles Way and the Wherryman&#x27;s Way at Great Yarmouth, and to both ends of the Weavers&#x27; Way, at Cromer and Great Yarmouth. In December 2014, the trail was extended to Sea Palling and forms part of the England Coast Path. In October 2016, the trail was further extended to Hopton-on-Sea.

<text>Stephen Valentine Patrick William Allen (December 26, 1921 – October 30, 2000) was an American television and radio personality, comedian, musician, composer, writer, and actor. In 1954, he achieved national fame as the co-creator and first host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, which was the first late-night television talk show.

Though he got his start in radio, Allen is best known for his extensive network television career. He gained national attention as a guest host on &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts.&quot; After he hosted &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, he went on to host numerous game and variety shows, including his own &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, and &quot;The New Steve Allen Show&quot;. He was a regular panel member on CBS&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and, from 1977 until 1981, he wrote, produced, and hosted the award-winning public broadcasting show &quot;Meeting of Minds&quot;, a series of historical dramas presented in a talk format.

Allen was a pianist and a prolific composer. By his own estimate, he wrote more than 8,500 songs, some of which were recorded by numerous leading singers. Allen won the 1964 Grammy Award for Best Original Jazz Composition for &quot;Gravy Waltz,&quot; for which he wrote the lyrics. He also wrote more than 50 books, including novels, children&#x27;s books, and books of opinions, including his final book, &quot;Vulgarians at the Gate: Trash TV and Raunch Radio&quot; (2001).

In 1996, Allen was presented with the Martin Gardner Lifetime Achievement Award from the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSICOP). He has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and a Hollywood theater named in his honor.

==Early life==
Allen was born in New York City, the only child of Billy Allen ( Carroll Abler) and Belle Montrose (born Isabelle Donohue), a husband-and-wife vaudeville comedy team. His father died when he was an infant. Allen was raised on the South Side of Chicago largely by his mother&#x27;s Irish Catholic family. Milton Berle called Allen&#x27;s mother &quot;the funniest woman in vaudeville.&quot;

Allen ran away from home at 16 and described in interviews the ease with which he took to begging.

Allen&#x27;s first radio job was on station KOY, in Phoenix, Arizona, after he left Arizona State Teachers College (now Arizona State University), in Tempe, while a sophomore. He enlisted in the United States Army during World War II and was trained as an infantryman. He served his enlistment period at Camp Roberts, California. Afterward, he returned to Phoenix, before moving back to California.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
==== Radio ====

Allen became an announcer for radio KFAC in Los Angeles, then moved to the Mutual Broadcasting System in 1946, talking the station into airing his five-nights-a-week comedy show &quot;Smile Time&quot;, co-starring Wendell Noble. After Allen moved to CBS Radio&#x27;s KNX in Los Angeles, his music-and-talk half-hour format gradually changed to include more talk in an hour-long late-night format, boosting his popularity and creating standing-room-only studio audiences.

During a show&#x27;s segment, Allen went into the audience with a microphone to ad lib on the air for the first time. This became a commonplace part of his studio performances for many years. His program attracted a huge local following; as the host of a 1950 summer replacement show for the popular comedy &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot;, he found himself in front of a national audience for the first time.

==== Television ====

Allen&#x27;s first television experience came in 1949, when he answered an advertisement for a television announcer for professional wrestling. Knowing nothing about wrestling, he watched some shows to gain insight and discovered that the announcers did not have well-defined names for the wrestling holds: when he got the job, he created names for many of the holds, some of which still are in use. After the first match got underway, Allen began ad-libbing in a comedic style that had audiences outside the arena laughing. An example:

After CBS radio gave Allen a weekly prime time show, CBS television believed he could be groomed for national television stardom and gave him his first network show. &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; premiered at 11 a.m. on Christmas Day, 1950, and was later moved to a thirty-minute, early evening slot. The new show required him to relocate, with his family, from Los Angeles to New York. It ran until 1952, after which CBS tried several different formats to showcase Allen&#x27;s talent.

He achieved national attention in early January 1951, when he was pressed into last-minute service to guest host the hugely popular &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot; when Godfrey was unable to appear. He turned one of Godfrey&#x27;s live Lipton tea and soup commercials upside down, preparing tea and instant soup on camera, then pouring both into Godfrey&#x27;s iconic ukulele. With the audience (including Godfrey, watching from Miami) laughing uproariously and thoroughly entertained, Allen gained major plaudits both as a comedian and as a host. &quot;Variety&quot; magazine editors who had seen the show wrote, &quot;One of the most hilarious one-man comedy sequences projected over the TV cameras in many a day ... The guy&#x27;s a natural for the big time.&quot;

Leaving CBS, Allen briefly hosted a talent-competition program on ABC called Talent Patrol in the first months of 1953.

At the same time, he became a regular on the popular panel television game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; from January 1953, substituting for the suspended Hal Block, and replacing Block by March. He continued on the show until 1954, and returned frequently as a panelist until the series ended in 1967. He once appeared as a regular contestant on June 19, 1966, but the panel failed to guess his line, which was selling motorcycles; Allen at the time was co-owner of a Los Angeles dealership selling Honda motorcycles. Those introducing him as a panelist sometimes jokingly called him the son of panelist Fred Allen, but the two men were unrelated. He also revived and popularized the question &quot;Is it bigger than a breadbox?&quot; while trying to guess the products associated with &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; contestants.

=== &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; ===
He then created a late-night New York talk/variety television program that debuted in July 1953 on local station WNBT-TV (now WNBC-TV). The following year, on September 27, 1954, the show went on the full NBC network as &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, with fellow radio personality Gene Rayburn (who later went on to host hit game shows such as &quot;Match Game&quot;, 1962–1982) as the original announcer. The show ran from 11:15 p.m. to 1 a.m. on the East Coast.

While &quot;Today&quot; developer Sylvester &quot;Pat&quot; Weaver often is credited as the &quot;Tonight&quot; creator, Allen often pointed out that he had created it earlier as a local New York show. Allen told his nationwide audience that first evening: &quot;This is &quot;Tonight&quot;, and I can&#x27;t think of too much to tell you about it except I want to give you the bad news first: This program is going to go on &quot;forever ...&quot; You think you&#x27;re tired now. Wait until you see one o&#x27;clock roll around!&quot; It was as host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; that Allen pioneered the &quot;man on the street&quot; comedic interviews and audience-participation comedy breaks that went on to become staples of late-night TV.

=== &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; ===
In June 1956, NBC offered Allen a new prime-time, Sunday night variety hour, &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;. NBC&#x27;s goal was to dethrone CBS&#x27;s top-rated &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. The show included a typical run of star performers, including early television appearances by rock and roll pioneers Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Fats Domino. Many popular television and film personalities were guest stars, including Bob Hope, Kim Novak, Errol Flynn, Abbott and Costello, Esther Williams, Jerry Lewis, Martha Raye, the Three Stooges, and a host of others.

The show&#x27;s regulars were Tom Poston, Louis Nye, Bill Dana, Don Knotts, Pat Harrington, Jr., Dayton Allen, and Gabriel Dell. All except film veteran Dell, who had appeared in the Bowery Boys movie series (also known as the Dead End Kids and the East Side Kids), were relatively obscure performers prior to their stints with Allen, and all went on to stardom. The comedians in Allen&#x27;s gang often were seen in his &quot;Man in the Street&quot; interviews about some topical subject. Poston would appear as a dullard who could not remember his own name. Nye&#x27;s character was an effete advertising executive named Gordon Hathaway, known for greeting the host with &quot;Hi ho, Steverino!&quot; Dana played amiable Latino &quot;Jose Jimenez.&quot; Knotts was an exceedingly jittery man who, when asked if he was nervous, invariably replied with an alarmed &quot;No!&quot;. Harrington was the Italian immigrant and former golf-pro Guido Panzini. Dayton Allen, who had gotten his start playing various characters on the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Howdy Doody,&quot; played wild-eyed zanies answering any given question with the question &quot;Why not?&quot; Dell usually played straight men in sketches (policemen, newsmen, dramatic actors, etc.), and occasionally played the character Boris Nadel, a Bela Lugosi/Dracula lookalike.

Other recurring routines included &quot;Crazy Shots&quot; (also known as &quot;Wild Pictures&quot;), a series of sight gags accompanied by Allen on piano; Allen inviting audience members to select three musical notes at random, and then composing a song based on the notes; a satire on radio&#x27;s long-running &quot;The Answer Man&quot; and a precursor to Johnny Carson&#x27;s Carnac the Magnificent (sample answer: &quot;Et tu, Brute.&quot; Allen&#x27;s reply: &quot;How many pizzas did you eat, Caesar?&quot;); and dramatic comedy readings of real letters to the editor from New York City newspapers.

Allen&#x27;s show also had one of the longest unscripted &quot;crack-ups&quot; on live television when Allen began laughing hysterically during &quot;Big Bill Allen&#x27;s Sports Roundup&quot;. Allen, known for his infectious high-pitched cackling laugh, laughed uncontrollably for over a minute with the audience laughing along, because, as he later explained, he caught sight of his unkempt hair on an off-camera monitor. He kept brushing his hair and changing hats to hide the messy hair, and the more he tried to correct his appearance the messier and funnier it got.

Allen helped the then-new Polaroid camera become popular by demonstrating its instant-picture capabilities during live commercials and amassed a huge financial windfall for his work because he had opted to be paid for it in Polaroid Corporation stock.

Allen remained host of &quot;Tonight&quot; for three nights a week (Monday and Tuesday nights were taken up by guest hosts for most of the summer of 1956; then by Ernie Kovacs through January) until early 1957 when he left the show to devote his attention to the Sunday night program. It was his (and NBC&#x27;s) hope that &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; could defeat Ed Sullivan in the ratings. Nevertheless, &quot;Maverick&quot; often bested both in audience size. In September 1959, Allen relocated to Los Angeles and left Sunday night television (the 1959–&#x27;60 season originated from NBC Color City in Burbank as &quot;The Steve Allen Plymouth Show&quot;, on Monday nights). Back in Los Angeles, he continued to write songs, hosted other variety shows, and wrote books and articles about comedy.

After being canceled by NBC in 1960, the show returned in the fall of 1961—on ABC, as &quot;The New Steve Allen Show&quot;. Nye, Poston, Harrington, Dell, and Dayton Allen returned. New cast members were Joey Forman, Buck Henry, the Smothers Brothers, Tim Conway, and Allen&#x27;s wife Jayne Meadows. The new version was canceled after fourteen episodes.

=== Later television projects ===

==== Westinghouse ====
From 1962 to 1964, Allen recreated &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on a new show, &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;, which was syndicated by Westinghouse TV. The five-nights-a-week taped show was broadcast from an old vaudeville theater at 1228 North Vine Street in Hollywood that was renamed &quot;The Steve Allen Playhouse&quot;. The new Allen show could be programmed by local stations as an alternative to the networks&#x27; late-night shows, but many stations opted to broadcast the Allen show during the daytime hours.

The show was marked by the same wild, unpredictable stunts, and comedy skits that often extended across the side street to an all-night food outlet known as the Hollywood Ranch Market, where Allen had a hidden camera spying on unsuspecting shoppers. On one show, he had an elephant race down the side street, much to the annoyance of the occupants of the neighboring houses. On this show, he originated the term &quot;little black things&quot; in reference to anything regarding food, and the term &quot;larger than Steve Allen&#x27;s breadbox&quot; in reference to any item under discussion. He also presented Southern California eccentrics, including health food advocate Gypsy Boots, quirky physics professor Dr. Julius Sumner Miller, wacko comic Professor Irwin Corey, and an early musical performance by Frank Zappa.

During one episode, Allen placed a telephone call to the home of Johnny Carson, posing as a rating company interviewer, asking Carson if the television was on, and what program he was watching. Carson did not immediately realize the caller was Allen. A rarity is an exchange between Allen and Carson about Carson&#x27;s guests, permitting him to plug his own show on a competing network.

One notable program, which Westinghouse refused to distribute, featured Lenny Bruce during the time the comic repeatedly was being arrested on obscenity charges. Footage from this program was first telecast in 1998 in a Bruce documentary aired on HBO. Regis Philbin briefly took over hosting the Westinghouse show in 1964.

The show also featured many jazz songs played by Allen and members of the show&#x27;s band, the Donn Trenner Orchestra, which included such virtuoso musicians as guitarist Herb Ellis and flamboyantly comedic hipster trombonist Frank Rosolino (whom Allen credited with originating the &quot;Hiyo!&quot; chant later popularized by Ed McMahon). While the show was not an overwhelming success in its day, David Letterman, Steve Martin, Harry Shearer, Robin Williams, and a number of other prominent comedians have cited Allen&#x27;s &quot;Westinghouse show,&quot; which they watched as teenagers, as being highly influential on their own comedic visions.

Allen later produced a second half-hour show for Westinghouse, titled &quot;Jazz Scene USA&quot;, which featured West Coast jazz musicians such as Rosolino, Stan Kenton, and Teddy Edwards. The short-lived show was hosted by Oscar Brown, Jr.

==== Network shows ====
In 1964 Allen returned to network television as moderator of the game show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; (replacing original host Garry Moore). In the summer of 1967, he brought most of the regulars from over the years back with &quot;The Steve Allen Comedy Hour&quot;, featuring the television debuts of Rob Reiner, Richard Dreyfuss, and John Byner, and featuring Ruth Buzzi, who would become famous soon after on the comedy ensemble show &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;. 

==== Filmways ====
In 1968 Steve Allen returned to syndicated variety/talk with a new show for Filmways, produced and co-written by Jeff Harris and Bernie Kukoff. The show was a free-wheeling, light-entertainment blend of comedy sketches, musical specialties, and conversation. It sometimes featured the same wacky stunts that would influence David Letterman in later years, including becoming a human hood ornament, jumping into vats of oatmeal and cottage cheese, and being slathered with dog food before allowing dogs backstage to feast on the food. During the run of this series, Allen also introduced Albert Brooks and Steve Martin to national audiences for the first time; Allen&#x27;s talent coordinator for the Filmways show was Bill Saluga, who himself became a TV personality in the 1970s as &quot;Raymond J. Johnson, Jr.&quot; (&quot;You can call me Ray! Or you can call me Jay!&quot;). The Filmways show was offered to local stations in both 60-minute and 90-minute versions; during each taping, after an hour had passed, Allen simply said goodbye to part of his audience and continued the show for those stations using the longer version. This Filmways show ran through 1971.

==== In the 1970s ====
Allen returned to guest host &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; for a single 1971 episode, and then became a semi-occasional guest host (15 episodes) from 1973 to 1977. After another long layoff, he guest-hosted two episodes in 1982, the last time he would host &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

A syndicated version of &quot;I&#x27;ve Got A Secret&quot; hosted by Allen and featuring panelists Pat Carroll and Richard Dawson was taped in Hollywood and aired during 1972–1973 season. In 1977, he produced &quot;Steve Allen&#x27;s Laugh-Back&quot;, a syndicated series combining vintage Allen film clips with new talk-show material reuniting his 1950s television gang. 

==== &quot;Meeting of Minds&quot; ====

From 1977 until 1981, Allen wrote, produced and hosted the award-winning show &quot;Meeting of Minds&quot;, which aired on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). The series brought together actors portraying historical figures such as Socrates, Marie Antoinette, Thomas Paine, Sir Thomas More, Attila the Hun, Karl Marx, Emily Dickinson, Charles Darwin, Oliver Cromwell, Daniel O&#x27;Connell, Galileo, and many others, as if transported from the past, all in a round table discussion and sometimes arguments. The dialogue covered issues such as racism, women&#x27;s rights, crime and punishment, slavery, and religious tolerance. Jayne Meadows-Allen played most of the female characters, wisely eschewing Emily Dickinson, played by Katherine Helmond, and the Empress Tz&#x27;u-hsi, played by Beulah Quo. Associated Press television columnist Peter Boyer called it the &quot;best talk show on television&quot;, created by the person who &quot;invented the television talk show&quot;, and added:
Allen was a &quot;philosophy fanatic&quot; and avid reader of classic literature and history. He wrote the scripts based on the actual writings and actions of the guests, and as host would lead the conversations to different subjects. He described the show as &quot;drama disguised as a talk show.&quot; Most of the female roles (Marie Antoinette, Catherine the Great, Florence Nightingale, et al.) were portrayed by Allen&#x27;s wife, the actress Jayne Meadows – over her objections. She resisted monopolizing these roles, but Allen was insistent. She recalled in 1994, &quot;He came to me and he said, &#x27;You&#x27;re gonna play Cleopatra.&#x27; I said, &#x27;I am &quot;not!&quot; Go away. Go away!&#x27; And he calmly said, &#x27;It&#x27;s a divorce if you don&#x27;t play it.&#x27;&quot;

Allen first conceived the show in 1959 but took almost 20 years to make it become reality. He initially produced a version in 1971 that aired locally in Los Angeles and earned three Local Emmy Awards. But, although it received critical acclaim from Hollywood critics, the distributor chose not to broadcast it nationally, feeling it would not draw a large enough audience. Even PBS backed off on showing it, and many in the television industry felt the series was &quot;too thoughtful&quot; for the American public. Allen then produced the first shows at his own expense, which resulted in attracting major backers. It eventually aired nationally, beginning in 1977.

The series, consisting of six hour-long episodes per season, became enormously popular. Allen received a Personal Peabody Award in 1977 for creating and hosting &quot;a truly original show.&quot; The award also recognized Meadows for her various portrayals. In 1981, the show won an Emmy for Outstanding Informational Series, and Allen&#x27;s writing was Emmy nominated. It was the show Allen wanted to be remembered for, because he believed the issues and characters were timeless and would survive long after his death. A similar Canadian television series called &quot;Witness to Yesterday&quot;, created by Arthur Voronka, aired in 1974, three years after Allen&#x27;s local Emmy Award-winning program. Allen appeared on a 1976 episode of &quot;Witness to Yesterday&quot; as composer-pianist George Gershwin.

==== In the 1980s ====
Allen remained friendly with television executive Fred Silverman, who was a longtime fan. After Silverman became head of programming at NBC, he hired Allen for two primetime projects: &quot;The Steve Allen Comedy Hour&quot; (1980), similar to Allen&#x27;s 1950s variety hour, with comic characters and sketches; and &quot;The Big Show&quot; (1980), an attempt to stage spectacular events for television. A third Silverman project got the green light: Allen would return to his roots as a late-night star, in a weeknight revival of &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;. Silverman scheduled the hourlong show for five nights a week at 12:30 a.m. Eastern time, immediately following &quot;The Tonight Show.&quot; Allen was excited about the opportunity, only to be disappointed: Johnny Carson was opposed to the plan and voiced his objections to Silverman. Silverman&#x27;s own schedule of new NBC shows was failing (Allen&#x27;s &quot;Comedy Hour&quot; ran for only five episodes and &quot;The Big Show&quot; for only eleven) and the network couldn&#x27;t afford to alienate the highly successful Carson, so the new Steve Allen show was abandoned.

From 1984 to 1986, Allen created and hosted &quot;Steve Allen&#x27;s Music Room&quot; which aired on the newly formed Disney Channel. This was a talk show with jazz vibraphonist Terry Gibbs leading a studio band with the top Los Angeles musicians to include Conte Candoli, Pete Candoli, Carl Fontana, Med Flory, Plas Johnson, Alan Broadbent, and drummer Frankie Capp. 27-year-old Bill Maher was the announcer and &quot;sidekick.&quot; The show featured musicians and entertainers including Melba Moore, Joe Williams, Paul Williams, Burt Bacharach, Anthony Newley, Rosemary Clooney, Lou Rawls, Dizzy Gillespie, Sarah Vaughan, and Henry Mancini. Allen spun off a similar show for Disney, &quot;Steve Allen&#x27;s Comedy Room&quot;, this time with professional comedians talking about comedy styles.

From 1986 through 1988, for NBC Radio, Allen hosted a daily, national three-hour comedy show that featured sketches and America&#x27;s better-known comedians as regular guests. His co-host was radio personality Mark Simone, and they were joined frequently by comedy writers Larry Gelbart, of M*A*S*H writing fame; Herb Sargent, perhaps, later on, best known for his writing work on &quot;Saturday Night Live,&quot; and Bob Einstein, brother of Albert Brooks and creator and portrayer of the faux stuntman character Super Dave Osborne.

On October 30, 1988, Allen played a radio newscaster in a remake of the famous &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; broadcast of fifty years earlier. The 1988 version was produced by WGBH in Boston and picked up by 150 National Public Radio stations.

=== Composer ===
According to his own estimate, Allen was a prolific composer who wrote more than 8,500 songs, although only a small fraction of them were ever recorded. In one famous stunt, he made a bet with singer-songwriter Frankie Laine that he could write 50 songs a day for a week. Composing on public display in the window of Wallach&#x27;s Music City, a Hollywood music store, Allen met the quota and won $1,000 from Laine. One of the songs, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to Church (Next Sunday Morning)&quot; became a chart hit for the duo of Jimmy Wakely and Margaret Whiting, hitting #13 pop and #2 country in 1950.

Allen began his recording career in 1951 with the album &quot;Steve Allen At The Piano&quot; for Columbia Records. He then signed with Decca Records, recording for their subsidiaries Brunswick Records and then Coral Records. Allen would release a mixture of novelty singles, jazz recordings and straight pop numbers for Decca throughout the 1950s, before switching to Dot Records in the 1960s.
Allen&#x27;s best-known song, &quot;This Could Be the Start of Something&quot;, dates from 1954. Though it was never a hit, the song was recorded by numerous artists, including Count Basie, Tony Bennett, Bobby Darin, Ella Fitzgerald, Mark Murphy Judy Garland, Aretha Franklin, Lionel Hampton, Claire Martin and Oscar Peterson. Allen used it as the theme song of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in 1956/57, and as the theme song to many of his later television projects.

Allen wrote the lyrics for the standard &quot;Theme from Picnic&quot; from the film &quot;Picnic&quot; in 1955; the song was a No. 13 U.S. hit in a vocal version for The McGuire Sisters in 1956. The song, however, is chiefly remembered as an instrumental, often performed in a medley with &quot;Moonglow,&quot; a popular song from 1933. Two instrumental versions charted in the U.S. top 5 in 1956, including a No. 1 hit version by Morris Stoloff. Because he did not write the music, Allen was not credited as a songwriter on the instrumental versions.

In 1957, Jerry Vale had a minor hit (US #52) with the Allen composition &quot;Pretend You Don&#x27;t See Her&quot;. The song was later covered by Bobby Vee, who would also chart with it (US #97) in 1965, and Vale&#x27;s recording would later be heard in the 1990 gangster film &quot;GoodFellas&quot;.

&quot;Gravy Waltz&quot; was composed and originally performed by Ray Brown as an instrumental in the early 1960s. Allen later set words to it, and the collaboration won the 1964 Grammy Award for Best Original Jazz Composition. Issued as an instrumental single in 1963, it hit No. 64 on the US Billboard charts. Though the single version was credited to &quot;Steve Allen With Donn Trenner And His Orchestra,&quot; Allen did not play on it. As well, though Allen was credited as co-songwriter for his lyrics, the hit single version was strictly an instrumental performance.

Similarly, sometime in the 1950s, Allen set words to &quot;South Rampart Street Parade,&quot; a 1938 instrumental hit for Bob Crosby, written by Bob Haggart and Ray Bauduc. Though the song still is best known as an instrumental, Allen&#x27;s later lyrics occasionally are performed.

In the realm of theatre, Allen wrote the music and lyrics for the Broadway musical &quot;Sophie&quot;, which was based on the early career of the woman long billed as &quot;The Last of the Red-Hot Mamas,&quot; entertainer Sophie Tucker. The book for the show was by Philip Pruneau. Libi Staiger and Art Lund were featured in the leading roles. &quot;Sophie&quot; opened at the Winter Garden Theatre in New York, after tryouts in three other cities, on April 15, 1963, to mostly unfavorable critical notices. It closed five days later, on April 20, after just eight performances. As Ken Mandelbaum noted in his 1991 book &quot;Not Since Carrie&quot;:

The show received consistently negative reviews in Columbus, Detroit, Philadelphia and New York, and its problems were obvious: a cliché-ridden standard show-biz bio book, and an ordinary score ... The score went unrecorded (by the cast), although several months later Judy Garland sang three songs from &quot;Sophie&quot; on her CBS television series.

Though Mandelbaum doesn&#x27;t mention it, Allen was a guest on the episode of &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot; in which she featured Allen&#x27;s songs from &quot;Sophie&quot;. Later, a &quot;compiled&quot; recording of &quot;Sophie&quot; was released with vocals by Allen, Libi Staiger, Garland, and others.

Allen&#x27;s other produced musical was the 1969 London show &quot;Belle Starr&quot;, which starred Betty Grable as the American West character. Allen wrote the music, and was one of three credited lyricists. &quot;Belle Starr&quot; also received poor reviews in both its Glasgow tryout and in its London run, and closed after 12 performances. Like &quot;Sophie&quot;, the score went unrecorded by the cast. No compiled recording of the score has been made.

Allen also composed the score to Paul Mantee&#x27;s James Bond–inspired film &quot;A Man Called Dagger&quot; (1967), with the score orchestrated by Ronald Stein.

By the 1970s, Allen was no longer actively recording his music. He continued to compose material, however, and in 1985, Allen wrote 19 songs for Irwin Allen&#x27;s television mini-series &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. The series starred his wife Jayne Meadows as the Queen of Hearts, among dozens of other celebrities.

After a long layoff from recording, in 1992 Allen issued the instrumental album &quot;Steve Allen Plays Jazz Tonight&quot;, which included interpretations of jazz classics as well as a handful of new original compositions.

=== Allen and rock music ===
While Allen often was critical of rock and roll music, he also often booked rock and roll acts on his television program &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;. It featured such acts as Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis, Louis Jordan &amp; the Tympany Five, the Treniers, and the Collins Kids. Allen famously scooped Ed Sullivan by being one of the first to present Elvis Presley on network television (after Presley had appeared on the Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey &quot;Stage Show&quot; and Milton Berle shows).

While Presley was an exceedingly controversial act at the time, &quot;Allen found a way ... to satisfy the Puritans. He assured viewers that he would not allow Presley &#x27;to do anything that will offend anyone.&#x27; NBC announced that a &#x27;revamped, purified and somewhat abridged Presley&#x27; had agreed to sing while standing reasonably still, dressed in black tie.&quot; Allen avoided any controversy by inviting Presley to participate in the show&#x27;s comedy. Elvis wore white tie and tailcoat while singing &quot;Hound Dog&quot; to a hound, which was attired with a top hat. The singer was also featured in a country-music sketch with Allen, Andy Griffith, and Imogene Coca.

Allen also appeared on the shows of other entertainers, even the mildly rock and roll program &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom&quot; on ABC; Boone had appeared as a guest on Allen&#x27;s variety hour.

=== Actor ===
Allen was an occasional actor. He wrote and starred in his first film, the Mack Sennett comedy compilation &quot;Down Memory Lane&quot;, in 1949. His most famous film appearance was in 1956&#x27;s &quot;The Benny Goodman Story&quot;, in the title role. The film, while an average biopic of its day, was hailed for its music, featuring many alumni of the Goodman band. Allen later recalled his one contribution to the film&#x27;s music, used in the early scenes. The accomplished Benny Goodman no longer could produce the sound of a clarinet beginner, and that was the only sound Allen &quot;could&quot; produce on a clarinet. 

In 1960, he appeared as the character &quot;Dr. Ellison&quot; in the episode &quot;Play Acting&quot; on CBS&#x27;s anthology series &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot; though his &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; had been in competition with the program the preceding season. 

Allen sometimes appeared as himself (or as thinly disguised versions of himself) as a TV host in feature films (like &quot;The Comic&quot;) and TV shows (&quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;The Snoop Sisters&quot;).

During the late 1980s, Allen and Jayne Meadows, his second wife, made three appearances on the television drama series &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;. They played the estranged birth parents of the character Dr. Victor Ehrlich, who had given him up for adoption. And, in 1998, Allen and Meadows guest-starred in an episode of &quot;&quot;.

Allen did voice work in two episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in the 1990s, appearing once as the electronically &quot;altered&quot; voice of Bart Simpson in season 3&#x27;s &quot;Separate Vocations&quot;, and as himself in season 6&#x27;s &#x27;Round Springfield&quot;. In 1997, Allen was a guest on the &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; episode &quot;Boat Show.&quot;

=== Author ===
Allen was a comedy writer and author of more than 50 books, including several volumes of autobiography; children&#x27;s books; a series of mystery novels; and numerous volumes of essays and opinions. Twenty of his books were concerned with his views about religion.

Among his better-known non-fiction works are &quot;Dumbth&quot;, a commentary on the American educational system, and &quot;Steve Allen on the Bible, Religion, and Morality&quot;. Allen also ostensibly authored a long-running series of mystery novels in the 1980s and &#x27;90s &quot;starring&quot; himself and Meadows as amateur sleuths. They later were revealed to have been ghostwritten by Walter J. Sheldon and, later, by Robert Westbrook.

Despite his lifelong reputation for political liberalism, morally, Allen was highly critical of vulgarity on both television and radio, and particularly strident in criticizing Howard Stern and other shock jocks. At the time of his death, he was completing a book on the subject called &quot;Vulgarians at the Gate,&quot; about what he saw as &quot;the rising tide of smut on television.&quot;

=== Scientific skepticism ===
Allen, a freethinker and humanist, became an outspoken critic of organized religion and an active member of the scientific skepticism movement. He worked to promote critical thinking with such humanist and skeptical organizations as the Council for Media Integrity, a group that debunked pseudoscientific claims, and the California-based group The Skeptics Society. He wrote many pieces for their publication, &quot;Skeptic&quot;, on such topics as the Church of Scientology, genius, and the passing of science fiction giant Isaac Asimov.

Working with Paul Kurtz, publisher of Prometheus Books, Allen published 15 books, including &quot;Dumbth: The Lost Art of Thinking with 101 Ways to Reason Better and Improve Your Mind&quot;, which was reissued in 1998. He produced &quot;Gullible&#x27;s Travels&quot;, an audiotape with original music and script that was read and sung by him and his wife &quot;in order to introduce youngsters to the brain and its proper use.&quot; Wishing to counter the influence of the American Christian right, Allen wrote both a 1990 critique of the Bible (&quot;Steve Allen on the Bible, Religion and Morality&quot;) as well as a sequel. A sample passage from the book that illustrated his view of the Judeo-Christian-Islamic God reads:

The proposition that the entire human race — consisting of enormous hordes of humanity — would be placed seriously in danger of a fiery eternity characterized by unspeakable torments purely because a man disobeyed a deity by eating a piece of fruit offered him by his wife is inherently incredible.

In 2011 Allen was selected for inclusion in the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry&#x27;s Pantheon of Skeptics.

=== Activities in later years ===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Allen recorded a solo piano album for the Pianocorder Contemporary Artists Series, joining such other pop pianists of the day as Liberace, Floyd Cramer, Teddy Wilson, Roger Williams, and Johnny Guarnieri. His solo album was popular.

In 1986, Allen was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.

Allen was on the advisory board of the Los Angeles Student Film Institute.

Allen appeared in a public service announcement advocating for New Eyes for the Needy in the 1990s.

Steve Allen had last guest-hosted &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in 1982, and made his last appearance on it on September 27, 1994, for the show&#x27;s 40th-anniversary broadcast. Host Jay Leno was effusive in his praise, and actually knelt and kissed Allen&#x27;s ring.

Allen also narrated &quot;The Unreal Story of Professional Wrestling&quot;, a documentary of professional wrestling from its origins to 1998.

== Personal life ==

Allen and Dorothy Goodman married in 1943 and had three children: Steve Jr., Brian, and David. That marriage ended in 1952. Allen&#x27;s second wife was actress Jayne Meadows. They had one son, Bill Allen, named for Steve&#x27;s father. They were married in Waterford, Connecticut, on July 31, 1954, and remained married until his death in 2000.

In the late 1950s, author and philosopher Gerald Heard worked with psychiatrist Sidney Cohen to introduce intelligent, adventurous people to LSD, and Steve Allen was one of these.

== Beliefs and politics ==
Although Allen was brought up Roman Catholic, he later became a secular humanist and Humanist Laureate for the Academy of Humanism, a member of CSICOP and the Council for Secular Humanism. He received the Rose Elizabeth Bird Commitment to Justice Award from Death Penalty Focus in 1998. He was a student and supporter of general semantics, recommending it in &quot;Dumbth&quot; and giving the Alfred Korzybski Memorial Lecture in 1992.

Allen was a Democrat, even though Jayne Meadows was a Republican. He endorsed Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 United States presidential election. in 1973, he cohosted the &quot;America Goes Public&quot; telethon, which raised money for the Democratic National Committee, and included a &quot;Meeting of Minds&quot; segment with actors portraying Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Thomas Jefferson, and Cleopatra, speaking on democracy.

Allen wrote pamphlets on a variety of issues, including problems facing migrant workers, capital punishment and nuclear weapons proliferation. He once considered running for a seat in Congress from California, calling his politics &quot;middle-of-the-road radicalism&quot;.

Despite his liberal position on free speech, he actively campaigned against obscenity on television and criticized comedians such as George Carlin and Lenny Bruce for their use of expletives in their stand-up routines; Allen admired their originality and humor but deplored what he considered their excessive profanity. His later concerns about the lewdness he heard on radio and television, particularly the programs of Howard Stern, caused him to make proposals to restrict the content of programs, allying himself with the Parents Television Council. His full-page ad on the subject appeared in newspapers just before his unexpected death.

== Death and legacy ==
On October 30, 2000, Allen was involved in a minor traffic crash while traveling to visit his youngest son at home in Los Angeles. A driver struck the side of Allen&#x27;s car while backing out of a driveway, causing Allen to suffer a ruptured blood vessel, among other injuries, though he apparently did not realize he was seriously hurt. After Allen arrived at his son&#x27;s home, he took a nap and died in his sleep. At first, it was believed that he had a heart attack. However, Allen&#x27;s autopsy revealed that he actually died from hemopericardium, caused by injuries sustained in the crash. Though the condition was partially caused by atherosclerosis, the death was ruled accidental. According to his widow, Jayne Meadows, &quot;Typical of Steve, [who] was the dearest, sweetest man: He was hit by a man, backing into him, breaking all of his ribs, that pierced his heart ... and when he got out of the car, he said to the man, &#x27;What some people will do to get my autograph.&#x27;&quot;

Allen is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles. He has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame – a television star at 1720 Vine Street and a radio star at 1537 Vine Street. Jayne Meadows was buried next to Allen following her death in 2015.

<text>The Peddars Way is a long distance footpath that passes through Suffolk and Norfolk, England.

==Route==
The Peddars Way is 46 miles (74 km) long and follows the route of a Roman road. It has been suggested by more than one writer that it was not created by the Romans but was an ancient trackway, a branch or extension of the Icknield Way, used and remodelled by the Romans. The name-type, which recurs in medieval records from other parts of East Anglia, derives from Middle English &quot;pedder&quot;, meaning an itinerant trader. It is first mentioned on a map of 1587 AD. It starts at Knettishall Heath in Suffolk (near the Norfolk-Suffolk border, about east of Thetford), and it links with the Norfolk Coast Path at Holme-next-the-Sea.

Combined with the Norfolk Coast Path, it forms the Peddars Way &amp; Norfolk Coast Path National Trail, one of 15 National Trails in England and Wales, and the two paths together run for .

It is one of four long distance footpaths which, when combined, run from Lyme Regis to Hunstanton and are referred to as the Greater Ridgeway. At Knettishall Heath the Peddars Way links with the Icknield Way Path for 110 miles south west to Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire.

==Guide and waymarks==
A detailed 144-page guide, including 1:25 000 maps from the Ordnance Survey, and described south to north, is published in the series of National Trail Guides. The trail is very well marked with two general types of waymarker along the length of the route. At junctions there are signs marked ‘Peddars Way’ on plain wood fingerposts. Elsewhere white, yellow and green discs are used bearing the acorn sign used on such long-distance routes.

==Public transport==
The Peddars Way may be accessed by public transport. There is a path linking the southern end, at Knettishall Heath, to the nearby Harling Road railway station. Holme, at the northern end, has a regular bus service to King&#x27;s Lynn and Hunstanton. Holme also has a regular bus service to Sheringham. Both King&#x27;s Lynn and Sheringham allow onward connections using their regular rail services.
==Folklore==
The Peddars Way was traditionally supposed to be a haunt of the ghostly East Anglian hound Black Shuck.

<text>The Marriott&#x27;s Way is a footpath, cycle-path and bridleway in north Norfolk, England, between Norwich and Aylsham via Themelthorpe. It forms part of the National Cycle Network (NCN) (Route 1) and the red route of Norwich&#x27;s Pedalways cycle path network. It is open to walkers, cyclists and horse riders. Its total length is 24.6 miles (39.5 km). It has a mixture of surfaces: tarmac, compacted gravel and earth. The name of the route originates from the chief engineer and manager of the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway (M&amp;GNJR), William Marriott, who held the position for 41 years.

== Railway history ==

The path uses the trackbeds of two former railway lines: from Norwich to Themelthorpe and from Themelthorpe to Aylsham. The Themelthorpe to Norwich line was built in 1882 by the Lynn and Fakenham Railway Company, which was taken over by the M&amp;GNJR in 1893 as part of a line that ran to Melton Constable; this line gave a through route to the Midlands. The Themelthorpe to Aylsham line was completed in 1893 by the Great Eastern Railway to provide a link to its other lines at Wroxham and County School, close to North Elmham. 
The lines were never profitable. Freight services were largely based on farm products and the line closed to passenger traffic in 1959.

In 1960, the two lines were joined by the &quot;Themelthorpe Curve&quot;, believed to be the sharpest bend on the British Rail network. Its construction was to maintain the important movement of concrete products from Lenwade railway station; once production ceased in 1985, the line was closed.

== Route ==

At Norwich, the path begins to the north of the Barn Road and Barker Street Inner Ring Road roundabout; much of this area was part of the former Norwich City railway station. The path, which is also known as the &quot;Railway Path&quot;, follows approximately the course of the River Wensum which forms a boundary with the Train Wood. 
After crossing a footbridge, the industrial landscape gives way to the water-meadows of the Sweetbriar Road Meadows before crossing the Wensum over the A frame bridge at Hellesdon. Travelling in a northerly direction from the junction of Marlpit Lane and Hellesdon Road, through the site of the former Hellesdon railway station, the way soon crosses the tiny River Tud at Costessey. The tree-lined River Wensum can be seen to the east, as the path passes through the open country side of the Wensum Valley. The river is crossed by means of an A-frame bridge (there are only three in Norfolk), before arriving at Drayton. The original Drayton railway station is now an industrial estate; the path follows a gravel path before crossing a minor road and entering a deep cutting to cross the busy A1067 road, close to Taverham. To the west is Thorpe Marriott, a large housing estate built in the late 20th century.
The tranquil path passes through extensive mixed woodland of the Mileplain plantation to cross the Wensum below Attlebridge. To the east of the way, the circular Winch&#x27;s Way can be accessed which links to the Swannington and Alderford commons. After reaching a country lane, the privately-owned former Attlebridge railway station can be viewed; the way can be accessed close to a car park and picnic area. After passing through birch woods, the large industrial estate of Lenwade can be seen to the west of the way and water filled gravel pits to the east. 
Crossing the Wensum for the last time, and close to the former Lenwade railway station which is now privately owned, and on to Whitwell railway station.
The (NCN) leaves Marriott&#x27;s Way to follow a short cut along quiet lanes to Reepham. The way carries on to Themelthorpe and follows the curve to the important stop of Reepham railway station, where the preserved station and engineering shed can be found. Following an easterly course, the path passes close by to the village of Cawston on the B1145 road and then crosses the B1149 road. To the north, the way links to Blickling Hall via Weavers Way before reaching the end of the trail at Aylsham; directly opposite is Aylsham railway station and Bure Valley Path, a walking and cycling route.

== Ecology ==
While the railway line was in use, trackside vegetation would have been partly controlled. The vegetation would have been cut regularly or sprayed with herbicides, so that trains were not obstructed and to lessen the risk of fire. When the railway closed, such management ceased and a wide variety of plants colonised the track; this has made it the diverse habitat for wildlife that it is today.

Today

In the Wensum Valley, immediately above the flood plain between Hellesdon and Drayton, over 100 species of vegetation have been recorded including hawthorn, guelder rose, wild rose, blackthorn, scrub oak, gorse and broom. Many wild flowers can be found such as shepherd&#x27;s purse, ox-eye daisy, white campion and meadow saxifrage. Closer to the river, the soil becomes heavier and wetter and vegetation includes alder, elder, marsh marigold and willow.

To the north of Drayton, the way passes over a variety of soil types. On the chalky soils, typical plants found are the sycamore, birch and chalk grassland species such as wild carrot, self heal, bird&#x27;s-foot-trefoil, knapweed and mullein. On the sandy soils bracken, birch and gorse are the more dominant species. Also of note are lichens, which are colonising many of the concrete structures and bridges along the track. The way is an important area for insects, birds and small mammals because of the variety of wild plants that are found.

== Public works of art ==
Several concrete public works of art can be seen along the way, as a constant reminder of the line&#x27;s connection with the concrete industry and of its last days as a freight line, carrying concrete products. Also on view are hand crafted benches and places to rest; many of these memorials are to cyclists and other way users.

The route is marked by steel benches, fabricated from flat-bottomed rail at intervals of 1 mile starting from the site of Norwich City station. Each bench is to a different design, often with the rail twisted or bent, but always with a flat length at sitting height.
== Public access ==

Apart from the main trailheads at Norwich and Aylsham, the trail can be accessed at various points throughout its length.

<text>The Technical University of Denmark (), often simply referred to as DTU, is a polytechnic university and school of engineering. It was founded in 1829 at the initiative of Hans Christian Ørsted as Denmark&#x27;s first polytechnic, and it is today ranked among Europe&#x27;s leading engineering institutions. It is located in the town Kongens Lyngby, north of central Copenhagen, Denmark.

Along with École Polytechnique in Paris, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Eindhoven University of Technology, Technical University of Munich and Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, DTU is a member of EuroTech Universities Alliance.

==History==
DTU was founded in 1829 as the &quot;College of Advanced Technology&quot; (Danish: Den Polytekniske Læreanstalt). The Physicist Hans Christian Ørsted, at that time a professor at the University of Copenhagen, was one of the driving forces behind this initiative. He was inspired by the École Polytechnique in Paris, France which Ørsted had visited as a young scientist. The new institution was inaugurated on 5 November 1829 with Ørsted becoming its Principal, a position he held until his death in 1851.
The first home of the new college consisted of two buildings located in Studiestræde and St. Pederstræde in the center of Copenhagen. Although these buildings were expanded several times, they eventually became inadequate for the requirements of the college. In 1890 a new building complex was completed and inaugurated located in Sølvgade. The new buildings were designed by the architect Johan Daniel Herholdt.

In 1903, the College of Advanced Technology commenced the education of electrical engineers in addition to that of the construction engineers, the production engineers, and the mechanical engineers who already at that time were being educated at the college.

In the 1920s, space again became insufficient and in 1929 the foundation stone was laid for a new school at Østervold. Completion of this building was delayed by World War II and it was not completed before 1954.

From 1933, the institution was officially known as &quot;Danmarks tekniske Højskole (DtH)&quot;, which commonly was translated into English, as the &#x27;Technical University of Denmark&#x27;. On 1 April 1994, in connection with the joining of &quot;Danmarks Ingeniørakademi&quot; (DIA) and DTH, the Danish name was changed to &quot;Danmarks Tekniske Universitet&quot;, this done to include the word &#x27;University&#x27; thus giving rise to the initials DTU by which the university is commonly known today. The formal name, &quot;Den Polytekniske Læreanstalt, Danmarks Tekniske Universitet&quot;, however, still includes the original name.
In 1960 a decision was made to move the College of Advanced Technology to new and larger facilities in Lyngby north of Copenhagen. They were inaugurated on 17 May 1974.

On 23 and 24 November 1967, the University Computing Center hosted the NATO Science Committee&#x27;s Study Group first meeting discussing the newly coined term &quot;Software Engineering&quot;.

On 1 January 2007, the university was merged with the following Danish research centers: Forskningscenter Risø, Danmarks Fødevareforskning, Danmarks Fiskeriundersøgelser (from 1 January 2008: National Institute for Aquatic Resources; DTU Aqua), Danmarks Rumcenter, and Danmarks Transport-Forskning.

==Organization and administration==
The university is governed by a board consisting of 10 members: Six members are recruited from outside the university and they form the majority of the board. One member is appointed by the scientific staff and one member is appointed by the administrative staff. Two members are appointed by the university students.

The President of DTU is appointed by the university board. The President in turn appoints the Deans, and the Deans appoint the Heads of the departments.

In 2014, DTU was granted institutional accreditation by the Danish Accreditation Institution (a member of ENQA). The institutional accreditation ensures that the quality assurance system of the institution is well-described, well-argued, and well-functioning in practice.

Since DTU has no faculty senate, and since the faculty is not involved in the appointment of the President, Deans, or Department heads, the university has no faculty governance.

===DTU Engineering Technology===

DTU Engineering Technology is the university&#x27;s graduate engineering department (Danish: &quot;Center for Diplomingeniøruddannelse&quot;). Its facilities are located in Ballerup across 42.000 m2 of space designed by PLH Architects.

The institution was first established in 1881, as an independent university college known as &quot;Copenhagen University College of Engineering&quot; (Danish: &quot;Ingeniørhøjskolen i København&quot;). The University College of Engineering merged with DTU in 2013, at which point it became the school&#x27;s graduate engineering department.

===DTU Space===
The &quot;National Space Institute at the Technical University of Denmark&quot;, also known as &quot;DTU Space&quot; (), is a Danish sector research institute within DTU. The institute conducts research in astrophysics, Solar System physics, geodesy, and space technology in collaboration with the Niels Bohr Institute for Astronomy, Geophysics and Physics. The institute currently leads Swarm, a project to investigate the properties of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.

The institute was first established in 2005 as the Danish National Space Center through the merger of the Danish Space Research Institute and the geodesy part of the National Survey and Cadastre of Denmark. In 2008, the National Space Center was integrated into DTU, becoming DTU Space. It has a staff of 169, including researchers, engineers, and technicians.

=== Center for Electron Nanoscopy ===

The &quot;Center for Electron Nanoscopy (&quot;Danish: &quot;Center for Elektronnanoskopi&quot;, &quot;CEN)&quot; is a center for electron microscopy within the university. Inaugurated in December 2007, the institute was funded by a donation of DKK100 million from the A.P. Møller and Chastine Mc-Kinney Møller Foundation. DTU CEN houses seven electron microscopes built by FEI Company ranging from a standard scanning electron microscope to two highly specialized Titan transmission electron microscopes. The microscopes are available for use by both in-house and external users. They are housed in a new building designed especially for the microscopes, 314, and the offices are located on the first floor of the neighbouring building, 307.

==Campus==

The university is located on a plain known as &quot;Lundtoftesletten&quot; in the northeastern end of the city of Lyngby. The area was previously home to the airfield Lundtofte Flyveplads. The campus is roughly divided in half by the road Anker Engelunds Vej going in the east–west direction, and, perpendicular to that, by two lengthy, collinear roads located on either side of a parking lot. The campus is thus divided into four parts, referred to as quadrants, numbered one through four in correspondence with the conventional numbering of quadrants in the Cartesian coordinate system with north upwards.

=== DTU Risø Campus ===
The Risø Campus () is a satellite campus north of Roskilde which covers an area of more than 2.6 square kilometres. It houses a number of DTU&#x27;s institutes, as well as Aarhus University&#x27;s Department of Environmental Science and Department of Bioscience. The campus was formerly the site of the Risø National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy (), a scientific research organization established in 1956 and merged into DTU in 2007, before finally being dissolved on 1 January 2012. 

Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program (WAsP) is a tool used in the wind energy industry to simulate wind flow over terrain and estimate the long-term power production of wind turbines and wind farms. It has been in development by Risø and DTU Wind Energy for over 30 years, and runs on PCs using Microsoft Windows. 
=== DTU Campus Village ===

The Campus Village is an international student housing complex on the university&#x27;s Lyngby campus at Elektrovej 330. It houses up to 224 international students, most of them staying for the duration of a semester or an academic year, and it is made up of identical red containers arranged in rows, housing up to ten students each. The Campus Village was constructed in the summer of 2001, and was opened as an international student dormitory starting in fall 2001. Residents staying in Campus Village may be participants of exchange or bilateral agreement programs between DTU and their home university.

Besides the Campus Village, several other dorm facilities are offered on campus. These are handled and rented out by UBSBOLIG.

==Controversy==
DTU was the subject of controversy in 2009 because the (then) institute director of the Department of Chemistry, O.W. Sørensen, was a high-ranking member of Scientology. In relation to this, the university was accused of violating the principles of free speech by threatening to fire employees, among them Rolf W. Berg, who voiced their criticism of the institute director. On 7 April 2010, the successor of Sørensen was announced, at a department meeting, as Erling Stenby, who officially took over as Director on 1 May 2010.

==Rankings==

The university maintains an updated site with the university&#x27;s standing in several relevant academic and research rankings. In November 2007 the &quot;Times Higher Education Supplement&quot; put the university as number 130 in their ranking of the universities of the world and number 122 in 2010.

<doc id="144201" wikidata="Q454081" url="?curid=144201" title="Kenny Baker (English actor)">
<text>Kenneth George Baker (24 August 1934 – 13 August 2016) was an English actor, comedian and musician. He portrayed the character R2-D2 in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise and also appeared in &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, &quot;Time Bandits&quot;, &quot;Willow&quot;, &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, &quot;Amadeus&quot; and &quot;Labyrinth&quot;.

== Early life ==
Baker was born and educated in Birmingham, Warwickshire, and at a boarding school in Kent. He was the son of Ethel (1906–1990), a pianist and dress maker, and Harold Baker (1908–1949), an artist, musician and draughtsman. He went to live with his father, stepmother, and half-sister in Hastings, Sussex.

Due to his dwarfism, Baker stood as an adult. Both his parents were of average height.

== Career ==

=== Beginnings ===
In 1951, Baker was approached on the street by a woman who invited him to join John Lester&#x27;s theatrical troupe of little people. This was his first taste of show business. Later, he joined a circus for a brief time, learned to ice skate and appeared in many ice shows. He formed a successful comedy act called The Mini Tones with entertainer Jack Purvis and played in nightclubs.

=== &quot;Star Wars&quot; ===
While working with Purvis and the Minitones, Baker was selected by George Lucas to operate the robot (&quot;droid&quot;) R2-D2 in the fantasy feature film &quot;Star Wars&quot;, released in 1977. Baker recalled that he initially turned down the role, concerned about breaking up the Minitones partnership when the duo had reached the final on the British television talent show &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot;.

Baker appears as R2-D2 in six of the episodic theatrical &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, and played an additional role in 1983&#x27;s &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; as Paploo, the ewok who steals an Imperial speeder bike. He was originally due to play the ewok named Wicket, but he fell ill and that role was handed over to Warwick Davis.

As technology grew and the need to have Baker in the suit decreased over time, he was used sporadically in the prequel trilogy. In &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;, he was used in just one scene.

Baker continued his Star Wars association with the R2-D2 character in &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;, which was released on 18 December 2015 in North America. He was going to be a member of the cast, but he served as consultant for the character instead. In November 2015, it was confirmed that Jimmy Vee was cast as R2-D2 in &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot;, replacing Baker.

=== Other work ===
Baker&#x27;s other films include &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (also with Jack Purvis), &quot;Willow&quot; (also with Purvis and Warwick Davis), &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, &quot;Amadeus&quot; and Jim Henson&#x27;s &quot;Labyrinth&quot;.

On television, he appeared in the British medical drama &quot;Casualty&quot;. He also had a part in the BBC production of &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;. In the late 1990s, Baker launched a brief comedy career. He played Casanova in the 1993 movie &quot;UFO.&quot;

In November 2009, his biography, &quot;From Tiny Acorns: The Kenny Baker Story&quot;, was written with Ken Mills and published by Writestuff Autographs.

== Personal life ==
Baker resided in Preston, Lancashire. He was married to actress Eileen Baker (who co-starred with him in the 1977 film &quot;Wombling Free&quot;) from 1970 until she died in 1993. Although Eileen also had dwarfism, their two children did not inherit their parents&#x27; dwarfism.

Baker was invited to attend the premiere of &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; in Los Angeles in December 2015, but was too ill to travel to the US. He had been living with a lung condition for years. Instead, Baker attended the film&#x27;s premiere in London.

== Death ==
Baker died on 13 August 2016, 11 days before his 82nd birthday. His funeral was held at the Park Cemetery and Crematorium in Lytham St Annes on 24 August 2016. His two sons, Christopher and Kevin survived him.

<doc id="144202" wikidata="Q5043456" url="?curid=144202" title="Carmen Dominicci">
<text>Carmen Dominicci Ramos (born July 15, 1966) is a Puerto Rican travel blogger, journalist, news anchor in the United States, and the winner of five Emmy Awards. &quot;People en Español&quot; magazine chose her as one of the &quot;50 Most Beautiful&quot; of 2010. She began her show business career as a model and actress.

==Early years and education==
Carmen Dominicci Ramos is a journalist and news anchor, recently transformed into travel blogger. She is the host of Carmen Dominicci Trotamundos, a travel blog that visits tourist destinations around the world, under its motto of &quot;Travel the world through my eyes.”

Dominicci was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, on July 15, 1966. She studied primary education in local schools and graduated magna cum laude from the Universidad del Sagrado Corazón with a degree in Journalism and Social Communication.

== Career in television ==
Dominicci began appearing in television commercials in the late 1980s. She represented Puerto Rico in various beauty pageants and international modeling competitions in the United States and Europe.

She pursued a career in television, first in theatrical plays and then in television miniseries, but she left that path to focus fully to her journalism studies.

In 1989 she married Puerto Rican actor Osvaldo Ríos with whom she had a son, Giuliano Ríos Dominicci. She and Osvaldo divorced in 1993.

In the 1990s, Carmen Dominicci became one of the most recognized news reporters in Puerto Rico thanks to her work on the Tele-Once Channel, and later as the presenter on WAPA-TV&#x27;s prime time newscast.

=== Arrival at Telemundo ===
In 1998, she signed a contract with Telemundo 47, New York, as a news anchor, position she held for four years, and in which she covered important events such as President Bill Clinton&#x27;s impeachment trial, the inauguration of President George Bush and the 9-11 attacks on the Twin Towers, among others.

=== Jump to Univision ===
In 2002 Carmen Dominicci joined the Univision network as a presenter of the &quot;Primer Impacto&quot; news program where she worked for three years, and conducted the night edition of the same program. Among her outstanding coverages were the death of Pope John Paul II, (broadcast directly from Rome, Italy), and the investigative series “Infierno Animal&quot; and &quot;Tragedia en Jimaní&quot; and &quot;Tragedia en Jimaní”, about the tragic landslide that caused the death of more than 400 people.

In October 2005, Carmen Dominicci and Rolando Nichols became presenters of the &quot;TeleFutura en Vivo y en Directo”, the most important news program of the network. The following year Carmen returned to Univision as a correspondent of the investigative show &quot;Aquí y Ahora&quot;, where she worked until 2009.

While she was working on &quot;Aquí y Ahora&quot; in 2007, Univision&#x27;s sister network, Galavision, created the journalistic talent contest &quot;Misión Reportar&quot;, and thanks to her credibility, Carmen was chosen as the host.

In that same year the journalist married her ex-coworker of &quot;Primer Impacto&quot;, Fernando del Rincón, but the couple divorced in 2008.

=== Return to Telemundo ===
In 2009 Telemundo re-hired Dominicci as one of the main faces of the &quot;Telemundo News&quot; team in one of the best stages of the network, which by then was already part of the NBC conglomerate.

Their most important coverages included such major events as the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the rescue of the 33 miners and the catastrophe of the earthquake and tsunami in Chile, both in 2010.

In 2011, she joined as a co-host and correspondent for the &quot;Al Rojo Vivo&quot; news program and joined the special investigative team of Noticias Telemundo, where she won several awards for the special &quot;&quot;Muriendo por Cruzar”&quot;, about immigration at the Mexican / American border. She also interviewed many well known personalities such as the soccer star David Beckham.

During one documentary Dominicci did for Telemundo and for The Weather Channel about immigration to the United States which was named &quot;Muriendo Por Cruzar&quot; (&quot;Dying to Cross&quot;), she had the gruesome experience of recording a scene in which she stood in front of a dozen dead people. (warning: graphic content)

=== Career as travel blogger and influencer ===
Her passion to travel the world led Carmen Dominicci to make a complete change in her career.

After leaving her job at Telemundo, in December 2015, she launched her own travel blog called &quot;Carmen Dominicci Trotamundos,&quot; under the motto &quot;Travel the world through my eyes&quot;.

The objective of the journalist, who worked for 23 years reporting hard news, is to show well known and hidden tourist destinations in all continents, but teach savings techniques and share smart tips for tourists who want to get the best of their travel experiences.

==Awards and honors==
During more than two decades of journalistic career, Dominicci accumulated numerous awards and recognitions, among which are:

Yerba Buena Island has had several other names over the decades: Sea Bird Island, Wood Island, and Goat Island. The island may have been named after the pueblo of Yerba Buena, which was named for the plant of the same name that was abundant in the area. The plant&#x27;s English and Spanish common name, Yerba buena, is an alternate form of the Spanish (literally meaning &#x27;good herb&#x27;), generally used to describe local species of the mint family.

Today, the military reservation southeast of the Yerba Buena Tunnel belongs to the United States Coast Guard (USCG) District Eleven. The US Coast Guard Sector San Francisco – Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) tower is located on Signal Road Building 278 atop the peak of the island. The US Coast Guard Sector San Francisco Headquarters is co-located with US Coast Guard Station San Francisco on Healy Avenue and Fresnel Way at water-level on the southeast coast of the island. The Coast Guard Aids to Navigation San Francisco has a navigational buoy repair facility on Fresnel Way. The USCG Senior Officers&#x27; residences are in Quarters A, B, C, 8 and 9 off of Hillcrest Road on the hill atop the USCG base. During the summer of 2011, the Department of Homeland Security / United States Coast Guard opened the new SAFE Port Act (2006) Interagency Operations Center (IOC at Building 100 site on Spindrift Circle) on the US Coast Guard Sector / Station San Francisco base. The IOC houses the VTS, WatchKeeper and the US Coast Guard Sector San Francisco Command Center together in one building.

==History==

Yerba Buena Island was the site of an Ohlone fishing village, Tuchayune.

The island&#x27;s name dates to the Portola Expedition, appearing on Ayala&#x27;s 1775 chart of the bay as &quot;Isla de Alcatraces&quot;, or &quot;island of the pelicans&quot;, for the birds who were abundant there. Later Frederick William Beechey, an English naval officer and explorer, transferred the name &quot;Alcatraz Island&quot; to the rock which bears the name of the federal penitentiary. The name &quot;la Ysla de la Yerba Buena&quot; was given by early Spanish colonists as early as 1795. &quot;Yerba buena&quot; can refer to any of a number of fragrant herbal plants. In this instance, it referred to the native plant &quot;Clinopodium douglasii&quot; which was found growing in abundance around the Bay Area. The plant has a fragrance like spearmint, also commonly referred to as &quot;yerba buena&quot;, so the name was applied to &quot;Clinopodium douglasii&quot; as well. It is not clear from any record if the island was named for the herb directly, or for the nearby cove and settlement of Yerba Buena.

The Isla de Yerba Buena was granted to one of the sons or grandsons of Joaquin Isidro de Castro (b.1732, Sinaloa), progenitor of one of the largest Californio families.

Officially, the island was Yerba Buena Island until 1895, when on a decision by the United States Board on Geographic Names, it was changed to Goat Island. During the gold rush, a large number of goats were pastured on the island. The name &quot;Goat Island&quot;, came into widespread use. It was changed back to Yerba Buena Island on June 3, 1931.

On March 3, 1871, Representative Stephen L. Mayham of the Subcommittee on Private Land Claims reported an unsuccessful claim by Thomas H. Dowling that he had purchased Yerba Buena Island on September 10, 1849, from Gorham Hyronemo Nye, who had received the island in 1835 &quot;as a compensation for transporting the body of the deceased Governor José Figueroa from Monterey to Santa Barbara&quot;.

The idea of a military post on Yerba Buena Island originated during the American Civil War, when it was feared a raiding Confederate warship could slip past Fort Point and Alcatraz Island during a foggy night. However, it was not until the 1870s that Army Post Camp Yerba Buena Island (a.k.a. Army Post Camp Decature a.k.a. Army Post at Goat island a.k.a. US Engineer Depot, Yerba Buena Island and a.k.a. US Quartermaster Depot, Yerba Buena Island) by Navy Road and North Gate Road was completed, including a fog signal and octagonal lighthouse called Yerba Buena Light (1875) that remain today at the end of Hillcrest Road. In 1891, the United States Army Corps of Engineers built a Torpedo Station / Shed / Storehouse / Assembly building (Building 262) at the end of Army Road by North Gate Road. The torpedoes were actually floating mines that could be placed in the bay via cable for defense against intruding enemy vessels. The Torpedo Station was abandoned in the 1930s but still stands today (hidden underneath the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge) listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

Just before the turn of the 20th century, the first U.S. Naval Training Station on the Pacific Coast was established on the north east side of the island by 1st Street and North Gate Road. Quarters One, also known as the Admiral Nimitz House near the intersection of Whiting Way and Garden Way, was built about 1900 as the Naval Training Station commandant&#x27;s residence and is among the eight surviving officers&#x27; residences in the historic district. Its Classic Revival style, fashionable for private residences in the Bay Area at the time, was unusual for naval base housing. In 1963, Nimitz and his wife moved to the Nimitz House, where he died in 1966. His funeral was at the base chapel on Treasure Island and he was buried with full military honors at Golden Gate National Cemetery in San Bruno.

The training station closed after World War I. It was replaced as a West Coast training station in 1923 by Naval Training Center San Diego. Although the training station closed, the Navy maintained a presence with the stationary receiving ship USS &quot;Boston&quot; (1884), later renamed USS &quot;Despatch&quot; (IX-2) (1940), anchored in the harbor through World War II.

During World War II, Yerba Buena Island fell under the jurisdiction of Treasure Island Naval Station, the main headquarters of the 12th Naval District inside Building One. Built on the shoals of Yerba Buena Island, the Treasure Island was a Works Progress Administration project in the 1930s. After hosting the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition, the United States Navy deemed Treasure Island an ideal location for transporting people and machines to the Pacific theater, and on April 17, 1942, established Treasure Island Naval Station (for surface ships and submarines) and as an Auxiliary Air Facility airfield (for airships, blimps, dirigibles, planes, and seaplanes) which also included a portion of Yerba Buena Island. Quarters One became the residence of the Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet (CINCPACFLT). Furthermore, several other buildings used by the Naval Station during World War II remain on the island, including the Senior Officers&#x27; Quarters in Quarters A, B, C, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Buildings 83, 205, and 230 were support facilities for the senior officers&#x27; quarters.
In 1996, the naval base and the Presidio of San Francisco were decommissioned and opened to public control under these types of stipulations. Quarters One by Whiting Way and the other Senior Officers&#x27; Quarter by Garden Way are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) took over law enforcement jurisdiction of non-USCG parcels of Yerba Buena Island. San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD) Fire Station 48 on Treasure Island took over medical rescue &amp; fire protection of Yerba Buena Island (including USCG Sector / Station San Francisco) and portions of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge.

==Other points of interest==

Located west of the island was &quot;Blossom Rock&quot;, a treacherous submerged rock that lay only below the surface of the water at low tide. Blossom Rock was discovered and named in 1826 by Captain Beechey of . Beechey noted that the rock could be avoided by aligning the northern tip of Yerba Buena Island with two especially large redwood trees growing in the hills above Oakland as one entered the bay. These redwoods were located in what is now Roberts Regional Recreation Area, near the &quot;Madrone&quot; picnic area; the area is marked with a historical marker. The &quot;Navigation Trees&quot; were cut down in about 1851, exacerbating the danger of Blossom Rock. The top of the rock was blown up in 1870, and another section removed by blasting in the early 1930s.

There are three parks located on Yerba Buena Island. Hill Park near Treasure Island Road and Macalla Road used to be a military cemetery until the high visibility traffic approach to the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition necessitated its removal and transfer of graves to the San Francisco National Cemetery in the Presidio of San Francisco. Also located on the island are Blue Park and Tower Park.

Two water reservoirs are located on the island and provide water storage for use on the island and for fire hydrant service.

==Population==

As of 2007, after the City of San Francisco received authority over the island from the US Navy, a small community of 40 households, comprising about 100 people, had developed on the island.

In 2011, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors approved a 20-year development of the island that aims to build two neighborhoods with up to 8,000 residences, of which 25 percent are designated for affordable housing.

In 2015, the City of San Francisco evicted the majority of residents to make room for the development. Yerba Buena Island residents were offered either to be paid roughly $5,000 and move off the island or move into an apartment on Treasure Island. Roughly two-thirds of the residents chose to be relocated to Treasure Island. As of 2023 a 124-condo complex called the Bristol has opened, as has an affordable apartment complex for veterans. Most of the other planned developments have been hung up in lawsuits. A 69-foot-tall sundial/sculpture by Hiroshi Sugimoto opened on a Yerba Buena hilltop in June 2023.

==In popular culture==
In his book &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot;, published in 1840, Richard Henry Dana, Jr. mentions in the last chapter, actually a postscript chapter added 20 years later, that his ship of the 1830s voyage anchored &quot;between a small island, called Yerba Buena, and a gravel beach in a little bight or cove of the same name&quot;.

<doc id="144209" wikidata="Q193340" url="?curid=144209" title="Spark plug">
<text>A spark plug (sometimes, in British English, a sparking plug, and, colloquially, a plug) is a device for delivering electric current from an ignition system to the combustion chamber of a spark-ignition engine to ignite the compressed fuel/air mixture by an electric spark, while containing combustion pressure within the engine. A spark plug has a metal threaded shell, electrically isolated from a central electrode by a ceramic insulator. The central electrode, which may contain a resistor, is connected by a heavily insulated wire to the output terminal of an ignition coil or magneto. The spark plug&#x27;s metal shell is screwed into the engine&#x27;s cylinder head and thus electrically grounded. The central electrode protrudes through the porcelain insulator into the combustion chamber, forming one or more spark gaps between the inner end of the central electrode and usually one or more protuberances or structures attached to the inner end of the threaded shell and designated the &quot;side&quot;, &quot;earth&quot;, or &quot;ground&quot; electrode(s).

Spark plugs may also be used for other purposes; in Saab Direct Ignition when they are not firing, spark plugs are used to measure ionization in the cylinders – this ionic current measurement is used to replace the ordinary cam phase sensor, knock sensor and misfire measurement function. Spark plugs may also be used in other applications such as furnaces wherein a combustible fuel/air mixture must be ignited. In this case, they are sometimes referred to as flame igniters.

==History==
In 1860 Étienne Lenoir used an electric spark plug in his gas engine, the first internal combustion piston engine. Lenoir is generally credited with the invention of the spark plug.
Early patents for spark plugs included those by Nikola Tesla (in for an ignition timing system, 1898), Frederick Richard Simms (GB 24859/1898, 1898) and Robert Bosch (GB 26907/1898). Only the invention of the first commercially viable high-voltage spark plug as part of a magneto-based ignition system by Robert Bosch&#x27;s engineer Gottlob Honold in 1902 made possible the development of the spark-ignition engine. Subsequent manufacturing improvements can be credited to Albert Champion, to the Lodge brothers, sons of Sir Oliver Lodge, who developed and manufactured their father&#x27;s idea and also to Kenelm Lee Guinness, of the Guinness brewing family, who developed the KLG brand.
Helen Blair Bartlett played a vital role in making the insulator in 1930.

==Operation==
The function of a spark plug is to produce a spark at the required time to ignite the combustible mixture. The plug is connected to the high voltage generated by an ignition coil or magneto. As current flows from the coil, a voltage develops between the central and side electrodes. Initially no current can flow because the fuel and air in the gap is an insulator, but as the voltage rises further it begins to change the structure of the gases between the electrodes. Once the voltage exceeds the dielectric strength of the gases, the gases become ionized. The ionized gas becomes a conductor and allows current to flow across the gap. Spark plugs usually require voltage of 12,000–25,000 volts or more to &quot;fire&quot; properly, although it can go up to 45,000 volts. They supply higher current during the discharge process, resulting in a hotter and longer-duration spark.

As the current of electrons surges across the gap, it raises the temperature of the spark channel to 60,000 K. The intense heat in the spark channel causes the ionized gas to expand very quickly, like a small explosion. This is the &quot;click&quot; heard when observing a spark, similar to lightning and thunder.

The heat and pressure force the gases to react with each other, and at the end of the spark event there should be a small ball of fire in the spark gap as the gases burn on their own. The size of this fireball, or kernel, depends on the exact composition of the mixture between the electrodes and the level of combustion chamber turbulence at the time of the spark. A small kernel will make the engine run as though the ignition timing was delayed, and a large one as though the timing was advanced.

==Spark plug construction==
A spark plug is composed of a shell, insulator and the central conductor. It passes through the wall of the combustion chamber and therefore must also seal the combustion chamber against high pressures and temperatures without deteriorating over long periods of time and extended use.

Spark plugs are specified by size, either thread or nut (often referred to as &quot;Euro&quot;), sealing type (taper or crush washer), and spark gap. Common thread (nut) sizes in Europe are 10 mm (16 mm), 14 mm (21 mm; sometimes, 16 mm), and 18 mm (24 mm, sometimes, 21 mm). In the United States, common thread (nut) sizes are 10mm (16mm), 12mm (14mm, 16mm or 17.5mm), 14mm (16mm, 20.63mm) and 18mm (20.63mm).

===Parts of the plug===

====Terminal====
The top of the spark plug contains a terminal to connect to the ignition system. Over of the years variations in the terminal configuration have been introduced by manufacturers. The exact terminal construction varies depending on the use of the spark plug. Most passenger car spark plug wires snap onto the terminal of the plug, but some wires have eyelet connectors which are fastened onto the plug under a nut. The standard solid non-removable nut SAE configuration is common for many cars and trucks. Plugs which are used for these applications often have the end of the terminal serve a double purpose as the nut on a thin threaded shaft so that they can be used for either type of connection. This type of spark plug has a removable nut or knurl, which enables its users to attach them to two different kinds of spark plug boots. Some spark plugs have a bare thread, which is a common type for motorcycles and ATVs. Finally, in very recent years, a cup-style terminal has been introduced, which allows for a longer ceramic insulator in the same confined space.

====Insulator====
The main part of the insulator is typically made from sintered alumina (Al2O3), a very hard ceramic material with high dielectric strength, printed with the manufacturer&#x27;s name and identifying marks, then glazed to improve resistance to surface spark tracking. Its major functions are to provide mechanical support and electrical insulation for the central electrode, while also providing an extended spark path for flashover protection. This extended portion, particularly in engines with deeply recessed plugs, helps extend the terminal above the cylinder head so as to make it more readily accessible.

A further feature of sintered alumina is its good heat conduction – reducing the tendency for the insulator to glow with heat and so light the mixture prematurely.

====Ribs====
By lengthening the surface between the high voltage terminal and the grounded metal case of the spark plug, the physical shape of the ribs functions to improve the electrical insulation and prevent electrical energy from leaking along the insulator surface from the terminal to the metal case. The disrupted and longer path makes the electricity encounter more resistance along the surface of the spark plug even in the presence of dirt and moisture. Some spark plugs are manufactured without ribs; improvements in the dielectric strength of the insulator make them less important.

====Insulator tip====

On modern (post 1930s) spark plugs, the tip of the insulator protruding into the combustion chamber is the same sintered aluminium oxide (alumina) ceramic as the upper portion, merely unglazed. It is designed to withstand and 60 kV.

Older spark plugs, particularly in aircraft, used an insulator made of stacked layers of mica, compressed by tension in the centre electrode.

With the development of leaded petrol in the 1930s, lead deposits on the mica became a problem and reduced the interval between needing to clean the spark plug. Sintered alumina was developed by Siemens in Germany to counteract this. Sintered alumina is a superior material to mica or porcelain because it is a relatively good thermal conductor for a ceramic, it maintains good mechanical strength and (thermal) shock resistance at higher temperatures, and this ability to run hot allows it to be run at &quot;self cleaning&quot; temperatures without rapid degradation. It also allows a simple single piece construction at low cost but high mechanical reliability. The dimensions of the insulator and the metal conductor core determine the heat range of the plug. Short insulators are usually &quot;cooler&quot; plugs, while &quot;hotter&quot; plugs are made with a lengthened path to the metal body, though this also depends on the thermally conductive metal core.

====Seals====
Because the spark plug also seals the combustion chamber of the engine when installed, seals are required to ensure there is no leakage from the combustion chamber. The internal seals of modern plugs are made of compressed glass/metal powder, but old style seals were typically made by the use of a multi-layer braze. The external seal is usually a crush washer, but some manufacturers use the cheaper method of a taper interface and simple compression to attempt sealing.

====Metal case/shell====
The metal case/shell (or the &quot;jacket&quot;, as many people call it) of the spark plug withstands the torque of tightening the plug, serves to remove heat from the insulator and pass it on to the cylinder head, and acts as the ground for the sparks passing through the central electrode to the side electrode. Spark plug threads are cold rolled to prevent thermal cycle fatigue. It&#x27;s important to install spark plugs with the correct &quot;reach,&quot; or thread length. Spark plugs can vary in reach from , such for automotive and small engine applications. Also, a marine spark plug&#x27;s shell is double-dipped, zinc-chromate coated metal.

====Central electrode====

The central electrode is connected to the terminal through an internal wire and commonly a ceramic series resistance to reduce emission of RF noise from the sparking. Non-resistor spark plugs, commonly sold without an &quot;R&quot; in the plug type part number, lack this element to reduce electro-magnetic interference with radios and other sensitive equipment. The tip can be made of a combination of copper, nickel-iron, chromium, or noble metals. 

In the late 1970s, the development of engines reached a stage where the heat range of conventional spark plugs with solid nickel alloy centre electrodes was unable to cope with their demands. A plug that was cold enough to cope with the demands of high speed driving would not be able to burn off the carbon deposits caused by stop–start urban conditions, and would foul in these conditions, making the engine misfire. Similarly, a plug that was hot enough to run smoothly in town could melt when called upon to cope with extended high speed running on motorways. The answer to this problem, devised by the spark plug manufacturers, was to use a different material and design for the centre electrode that would be able to carry the heat of combustion away from the tip more effectively than a solid nickel alloy could. Copper was the material chosen for the task and a method for manufacturing the copper-cored centre electrode was created by Floform.

The central electrode is usually the one designed to eject the electrons (the cathode, i.e. negative polarity relative to the engine block) because it is normally the hottest part of the plug; it is easier to emit electrons from a hot surface, because of the same physical laws that increase emissions of vapor from hot surfaces (see thermionic emission). In addition, electrons are emitted where the electrical field strength is greatest; this is from wherever the radius of curvature of the surface is smallest, from a sharp point or edge rather than a flat surface (see corona discharge). Using the colder, blunter side electrode as negative requires up to 45 percent higher voltage, so few ignition systems aside from wasted spark are designed this way. Waste spark systems place a greater strain upon spark plugs since they alternately fire electrons in both directions (from the ground electrode to the central electrode, not just from the central electrode to the ground electrode). As a result, vehicles with such a system should have precious metals on both electrodes, not just on the central electrode, in order to increase service replacement intervals since they wear down the metal more quickly in both directions, not just one.

It would be easiest to pull electrons from a pointed electrode but a pointed electrode would erode after only a few seconds. Instead, the electrons emit from the sharp edges of the end of the electrode; as these edges erode, the spark becomes weaker and less reliable.

At one time it was common to remove the spark plugs, clean deposits off the ends either manually or with specialized sandblasting equipment and file the end of the electrode to restore the sharp edges, but this practice has become less frequent for three reasons:
# cleaning with tools such as a wire brush leaves traces of metal on the insulator which can provide a weak conduction path and thus weaken the spark (increasing emissions).
# plugs are so cheap relative to labor cost, economics dictate replacement, particularly with modern long-life plugs.
# iridium and platinum plugs that have longer lifetimes than copper have become more common.

The development of noble metal high temperature electrodes (using metals such as yttrium, iridium, tungsten, palladium, or ruthenium, as well as the relatively high value platinum, silver or gold) allows the use of a smaller center wire, which has sharper edges but will not melt or corrode away. These materials are used because of their high melting points and durability, not because of their electrical conductivity (which is irrelevant in series with the plug resistor or wires). The smaller electrode also absorbs less heat from the spark and initial flame energy.

Polonium spark plugs were marketed by Firestone from 1940 to 1953. While the amount of radiation from the plugs was minuscule and not a threat to the consumer, the benefits of such plugs quickly diminished after approximately a month because of polonium&#x27;s short half-life, and because buildup on the conductors would block the radiation that improved engine performance. The premise behind the polonium spark plug, as well as Alfred Matthew Hubbard&#x27;s prototype radium plug that preceded it, was that the radiation would improve ionization of the fuel in the cylinder and thus allow the plug to fire more quickly and efficiently.

====Side (ground, earth) electrode====
The side electrode (also known as the &quot;ground strap&quot;) is made from high nickel steel and is welded or hot forged to the side of the metal shell. The side electrode also runs very hot, especially on projected nose plugs. Some designs have provided a copper core to this electrode, so as to increase heat conduction. Multiple side electrodes may also be used, so that they don&#x27;t overlap the central electrode. The ground electrode can also have small pads of platinum or even iridium added to them in order to increase service life.

===Spark plug gap===

Spark plugs are typically designed to have a spark gap which can be adjusted by the technician installing the spark plug, by bending the ground electrode slightly. The same plug may be specified for several different engines, requiring a different gap for each. Spark plugs in automobiles generally have a gap between . The gap may require adjustment from the out-of-the-box gap.

A &quot;spark plug gap gauge&quot; is a disc with a sloping edge, or with round wires of precise diameters, and is used to measure the gap. Use of a feeler gauge with flat blades instead of round wires, as is used on distributor points or valve lash, will give erroneous results, due to the shape of spark plug electrodes. The simplest gauges are a collection of keys of various thicknesses which match the desired gaps and the gap is adjusted until the key fits snugly. With current engine technology, universally incorporating solid state ignition systems and computerized fuel injection, the gaps used are larger on average than in the era of carburetors and breaker point distributors, to the extent that spark plug gauges from that era cannot always measure the required gaps of current cars. Vehicles using compressed natural gas generally require narrower gaps than vehicles using gasoline.

The gap adjustment (also called &quot;spark plug gapping&quot;) can be crucial to proper engine operation. A narrow gap may give too small and weak a spark to effectively ignite the fuel-air mixture, but the plug will almost always fire on each cycle. A gap that is too wide might prevent a spark from firing at all or may misfire at high speeds, but will usually have a spark that is strong for a clean burn. A spark which intermittently fails to ignite the fuel-air mixture may not be noticeable directly, but will show up as a reduction in the engine&#x27;s power and fuel efficiency. Gap adjustment is not recommended for iridium and platinum spark plugs, because there is a risk of damaging a metal disk welded to the electrode. 

===Variations on the basic design===

Over the years variations on the basic spark plug design have attempted to provide either better ignition, longer life, or both. Such variations include the use of two, three, or four equally spaced ground electrodes surrounding the central electrode. Other variations include using a recessed central electrode surrounded by the spark plug thread, which effectively becomes the ground electrode (see &quot;surface-discharge spark plug&quot;, below). Also there is the use of a V-shaped notch in the tip of the ground electrode. Multiple ground electrodes generally provide longer life, as when the spark gap widens due to electric discharge wear, the spark moves to another closer ground electrode. The disadvantage of multiple ground electrodes is that a shielding effect can occur in the engine combustion chamber inhibiting the flame face as the fuel air mixture burns. This can result in a less efficient burn and increased fuel consumption. They also are difficult or nearly impossible to adjust to another uniform gap size.

===Surface-discharge spark plug===
A piston engine has a part of the combustion chamber that is always out of reach of the piston; and this zone is where the conventional spark plug is located. A Wankel engine has a permanently varying combustion area; and the spark plug is inevitably swept by the rotor&#x27;s apex seals. If a spark plug were to protrude into the Wankel&#x27;s combustion chamber it would be hit by the passing apex seal, but if the plug were recessed to avoid this, mixture access to the spark would be reduced, leading to misfire or incomplete combustion. So a new type of &quot;surface discharge&quot; plug was developed, presenting an almost flat face to the combustion chamber. A stubby centre electrode projects only very slightly, and the entire earthed body of the plug acts as the side electrode. The electrodes thus sit just beyond the reach of the passing apex seal, while the spark is accessible to the fuel/air mixture. The arc gap remains constant throughout the entire service life of a surface-gap spark plug, A further advantage of the surface-gap design is that the side electrode cannot break off and potentially cause engine damage, though this also doesn&#x27;t often happen with conventional spark plugs.

===Sealing to the cylinder head===

Most spark plugs seal to the cylinder head with a single-use hollow or folded metal washer which is crushed slightly between the flat surface of the head and that of the plug, just above the threads. Some spark plugs have a tapered seat that uses no washer. The torque for installing these plugs is supposed to be lower than a washer-sealed plug. Spark plugs with tapered seats should never be installed in vehicles with heads requiring washers, and vice versa. Otherwise, a poor seal or incorrect reach would result because of the threads not properly seating in the heads.

===Tip protrusion===
 The length of the threaded portion of the plug should be closely matched to the thickness of the head. If a plug extends too far into the combustion chamber, it may be struck by the piston, damaging the engine internally. Less dramatically, if the threads of the plug extend into the combustion chamber, the sharp edges of the threads act as point sources of heat which may cause pre-ignition; in addition, deposits which form between the exposed threads may make it difficult to remove the plugs, even damaging the threads on aluminium heads in the process of removal. 

The protrusion of the tip into the chamber also affects plug performance, however; the more centrally located the spark gap is, generally the better the ignition of the air-fuel mixture will be, although experts believe the process is more complex and dependent on combustion chamber shape. On the other hand, if an engine is &quot;burning oil&quot;, the excess oil leaking into the combustion chamber tends to foul the plug tip and inhibit the spark; in such cases, a plug with less protrusion than the engine would normally call for often collects less fouling and performs better, for a longer period. Special &quot;anti-fouling&quot; adapters are sold which fit between the plug and the head to reduce the protrusion of the plug for just this reason, on older engines with severe oil burning problems; this will cause the ignition of the fuel-air mixture to be less effective, but in such cases, this is of lesser significance.

==Heat range==

The operating temperature of a spark plug is the actual physical temperature at the tip of the spark plug within the running engine, normally between . This is important because it determines the efficiency of plug self-cleaning and is determined by a number of factors, but primarily the actual temperature within the combustion chamber. There is no direct relationship between the actual operating temperature of the spark plug and spark voltage. However, the level of torque currently being produced by the engine will strongly influence spark plug operating temperature because the maximal temperature and pressure occur when the engine is operating near peak torque output (torque and rotational speed directly determine the power output). The temperature of the insulator responds to the thermal conditions it is exposed to in the combustion chamber, but not vice versa. If the tip of the spark plug is too hot, it can cause pre-ignition or sometimes detonation/knocking, and damage may occur. If it is too cold, electrically conductive deposits may form on the insulator, causing a loss of spark energy or the actual shorting-out of the spark current.

A spark plug is said to be &quot;hot&quot; if it is a better heat insulator, keeping more heat in the tip of the spark plug. A spark plug is said to be &quot;cold&quot; if it can conduct more heat out of the spark plug tip and lower the tip&#x27;s temperature. Whether a spark plug is &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;cold&quot; is known as the heat range of the spark plug. The heat range of a spark plug is typically specified as a number, with some manufacturers using ascending numbers for hotter plugs, and others doing the opposite – using ascending numbers for colder plugs.

The heat range of a spark plug is affected by the construction of the spark plug: the types of materials used, the length of insulator and the surface area of the plug exposed within the combustion chamber. For normal use, the selection of a spark plug heat range is a balance between keeping the tip hot enough at idle to prevent fouling and cold enough at maximal power to prevent pre-ignition or engine knocking. By examining &quot;hotter&quot; and &quot;cooler&quot; spark plugs of the same manufacturer side by side, the principle involved can be very clearly seen; the cooler plugs have a more substantial ceramic insulator filling the gap between the center electrode and the shell, effectively allowing more heat to be carried off by the shell, while the hotter plugs have less ceramic material, so that the tip is more isolated from the body of the plug and retains heat better.

Heat from the combustion chamber escapes through the exhaust gases, the side walls of the cylinder and the spark plug itself. The heat range of a spark plug has only a minute effect on combustion chamber and overall engine temperature. A cold plug will not materially cool down an engine&#x27;s running temperature. (A too hot plug may, however, indirectly lead to a runaway pre-ignition condition that &quot;can&quot; increase engine temperature.) Rather, the main effect of a &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;cold&quot; plug is to affect the temperature of the tip of the spark plug.

It was common before the modern era of computerized fuel injection to specify at least a couple of different heat ranges for plugs for an automobile engine; a hotter plug for cars that were mostly driven slowly around the city, and a colder plug for sustained high-speed highway use. This practice has, however, largely become obsolete now that cars&#x27; fuel/air mixtures and cylinder temperatures are maintained within a narrow range, for purposes of limiting emissions. Racing engines, however, still benefit from picking a proper plug heat range. Very old racing engines will sometimes have two sets of plugs, one just for starting and another to be installed for driving once the engine is warmed up.

Spark plug manufacturers use different numbers to denote heat range of their spark plugs. Some manufacturers, such as Denso and NGK, have numbers that become higher as they get colder. By contrast, Champion, Bosch, BRISK, Beru, and ACDelco use a heat range system in which the numbers become bigger as the plugs get hotter. As a result, heat range numbers need to be translated between the different manufacturers and cannot be casually interchanged as equals.

==Reading spark plugs==
The spark plug&#x27;s firing end will be affected by the internal environment of the combustion chamber. As the spark plug can be removed for inspection, the effects of combustion on the plug can be examined. An examination, or &quot;reading&quot; of the characteristic markings on the firing end of the spark plug can indicate conditions within the running engine. Engine and spark plug manufacturers will publish information about the characteristic markings in spark plug reading charts.

A light brownish discoloration of the tip of the block indicates proper operation; other conditions may indicate malfunction. For example, a sandblasted look to the tip of the spark plug means persistent, light detonation is occurring, often unheard. The damage that is occurring to the tip of the spark plug is also occurring on the inside of the cylinder. Heavy detonation can cause outright breakage of the spark plug insulator and internal engine parts before appearing as sandblasted erosion but is easily heard. As another example, if the plug is too cold, there will be deposits on the nose of the plug. Conversely if the plug is too hot, the porcelain will be porous looking, almost like sugar. The material which seals the central electrode to the insulator will boil out. Sometimes the end of the plug will appear glazed, as the deposits have melted.

An idling engine will have a different impact on the spark plugs than one running at full throttle. Spark plug readings are only valid for the most recent engine operating conditions and running the engine under different conditions may erase or obscure characteristic marks previously left on the spark plugs. The most valuable information is gathered by running the engine at high speed and full load, immediately cutting the ignition off and stopping without idling or low speed operation and removing the plugs for reading.

Spark plug reading viewers, which are simply combined flashlight/magnifiers, are available to improve the reading of the spark plugs.

==Indexing spark plugs==
&quot;Indexing&quot; of plugs upon installation involves installing the spark plug so that the open area of its gap, not shrouded by the ground electrode, faces the center of the combustion chamber rather than one of its walls. The theory holds that this will maximize the exposure of the fuel-air mixture to the spark, also ensuring that every combustion chamber is even in layout and therefore resulting in better ignition. Indexing is accomplished by marking the location of the gap on the outside of the plug, installing it, and noting the direction in which the mark faces. Then the plug is removed and washers are added to change the orientation of the tightened plug. This must be done individually for each plug, as the orientation of the gap with respect to the threads of the shell is random. Some plugs are made with a non-random orientation of the gap and are usually marked as such by a suffix to the model number; typically these are specified by manufacturers of very small engines where the spark plug tip and electrodes form a significantly large part of the shape of the combustion chamber. The Honda Insight has indexed spark plugs from factory, with four different part numbers available corresponding to the different degrees of indexing to achieve most efficient combustion and maximal fuel efficiency.

<text>Christopher Crosby Farley (February 15, 1964 – December 18, 1997) was an American actor and comedian. He was a member of Chicago&#x27;s Second City Theatre and later a cast member of the NBC sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for five seasons, from 1990 to 1995. He went on to pursue a film career, appearing in films such as &quot;Airheads&quot;, &quot;Tommy Boy&quot;, &quot;Black Sheep&quot;, &quot;Beverly Hills Ninja&quot;, and &quot;Almost Heroes&quot;. Farley was frequently known for his physical performance/comedy and athleticism (similar to Curly Howard and Roscoe Arbuckle). This was used to great effect during his time on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and continued through many of his films. From his early acting days, and through the height of his fame, Farley struggled with obesity, alcoholism, and substance abuse. He died of a drug overdose at the age of 33.

==Early life==
Christopher Crosby Farley was born in Madison, Wisconsin, on February 15, 1964 to an Irish-American family, and grew up in Maple Bluff. His father Thomas John Farley Sr. (1936–99) owned an oil company and his mother Mary Anne (née Crosby) was a homemaker. He had four siblings: Tom Jr., Kevin, John, and Barbara. His cousin Jim is chief executive officer at Ford Motor Company. Farley attended parochial schools in Madison, including Edgewood High School of the Sacred Heart. According to Joel Murray, a fellow Second City cast member, Farley would &quot;always make it to Mass.&quot;

Many of his summers were spent as a camper and counselor at Red Arrow Camp, near Minocqua, Wisconsin. He graduated from Marquette University in 1986, with a double major in communications and theater. At Marquette, he played rugby union and discovered a love of comedy. After college, he worked with his father at the Scotch Oil Company in Madison. He first learned the art of improvisational comedy at the Ark Improv Theatre in Madison.

Farley made his way to Chicago, performing first at Improv Olympic. He then attended Chicago&#x27;s Second City Theatre, starting the same day as Stephen Colbert, initially as part of Second City&#x27;s touring group. He was eventually promoted to their main stage in 1989, and was a cast member of three revues, &quot;The Gods Must Be Lazy&quot;, &quot;It Was Thirty Years Ago Today&quot;, and &quot;Flag Smoking Permitted in Lobby Only or Censorama&quot;.

==Career==

===&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;===
Along with Chris Rock, Farley was one of the new &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast members announced in early 1990. On &quot;SNL&quot;, Farley frequently collaborated with fellow cast members Chris Rock, Adam Sandler, Tim Meadows, Rob Schneider and David Spade. This group came to be known as the &quot;Bad Boys of SNL.&quot;

Popular characters performed by Farley included Matt Foley, an over-the-top motivational speaker who frequently reminded other characters that he was &quot;living in a van down by the river!&quot; The character was created by Bob Odenkirk when he and Farley were performers at Second City. The character&#x27;s name came from a longtime friend of Farley&#x27;s who became a Catholic priest and currently serves as pastor at St. James Catholic Church in Arlington Heights, Illinois. In early renditions of the character, Farley used other names, depending on whom he knew in the audience, until the real-life Foley went to the show and had his name used, at which point Farley felt the name best suited the character and refused to change it. Some of the mannerisms of the character were a combination of the positions Farley noticed his rugby teammates took on the pitch coupled with his high school football coach&#x27;s habit of squatting down when giving pep talks and the voice his father used when he was angry.

Other famous Farley characters included Todd O&#x27;Connor of Bill Swerski&#x27;s Superfans, a group of stereotypical Chicagoans who repeatedly shouted &quot;da Bears!&quot;; a would-be Chippendales dancer, in a famous sketch that paired him with guest host Patrick Swayze; one of the &quot;Gap Girls&quot;, who worked together at a local mall; a stereotypical lunch lady, to the theme of &quot;Lunchlady Land&quot;&#x27; performed by Adam Sandler; Bennett Brauer, a &quot;Weekend Update&quot; commentator who often divulged his personal and hygienic problems via air quotes; and himself on &quot;The Chris Farley Show&quot;, a talk show in which Farley &quot;interviewed&quot; the guest with poorly conceived questions or trailed off about subjects not germane to the guest.

Some of these characters were brought to &quot;SNL&quot; from his days at Second City. Farley also performed impersonations of Tom Arnold (who gave Farley&#x27;s eulogy at his private funeral), Andrew Giuliani, Jerry Garcia, Meat Loaf, Norman Schwarzkopf, Dom DeLuise, Roger Ebert, Carnie Wilson, Newt Gingrich, Mindy Cohn, Mama Cass, Hank Williams Jr., and Rush Limbaugh.

Off-screen, Farley was well known for his pranks in the offices of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Sandler and Farley would make late-night prank phone calls from the &quot;SNL&quot; offices in Rockefeller Center, with Sandler speaking in an old woman&#x27;s voice and Farley farting into the phone and mooning cars from a limousine, and even once defecating out a 17th floor window. He was also known to frequently get naked and do various stunts for laughs, including imitating Jame &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Gumb from the then-current film &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;. Rock once claimed that he probably saw Farley&#x27;s genitals more than Farley&#x27;s girlfriend did. Farley, alongside Sandler, was fired by NBC in 1995.

===Film career===
During his time on &quot;SNL&quot;, Farley appeared in the comedy films &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;, &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot;, &quot;Coneheads&quot;, &quot;Airheads&quot;, and had an uncredited role in &quot;Billy Madison&quot;. He also appeared in the music video for the Red Hot Chili Peppers single &quot;Soul to Squeeze&quot;, which was featured on the soundtrack to &quot;Coneheads&quot;.

After Farley and most of his fellow cast members were released from their contracts at &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; following the 1994–95 season, Farley began focusing on his film career. In his first two major films, &quot;Tommy Boy&quot; and &quot;Black Sheep&quot;, he starred with &quot;SNL&quot; colleague and close friend David Spade. These were a success at the domestic box office, earning around $32 million each and gaining a large cult following on home video. The two films established Farley as a relatively bankable star, and he was given the title role of &quot;Beverly Hills Ninja&quot;, which finished in first place at the box office on its opening weekend.

Farley was particularly dissatisfied with &quot;Black Sheep&quot;, an attempt by the studio to recapture the chemistry in &quot;Tommy Boy&quot;, and which was only 60 pages into the script when the project was green-lit. As a result, he relapsed on the night of the premiere, which required further rehab before he could begin work on &quot;Beverly Hills Ninja&quot;. His final completed films — &quot;Almost Heroes&quot; and &quot;Dirty Work&quot; — were posthumously released in May and June 1998, respectively.

===Unfinished projects===
Farley was originally cast as the voice of the title character in the animated film &quot;Shrek&quot; (2001), recording 85% of the character&#x27;s dialogue, but he died just before the voice-over was completed. The filmmakers considered having a Farley impersonator record the remaining lines, but Shrek&#x27;s dialogue was eventually re-recorded by former &quot;SNL&quot; castmate Mike Myers. A story reel and animation test featuring a sample of Farley as Shrek was released in 2015 and 2022 respectively. The original version of Shrek was more like Farley himself, according to his brother. Additionally, in Dana Carvey and David Spade&#x27;s podcast &quot;Fly on the Wall&quot; tribute episode to the 25th anniversary of Chris&#x27;s death, John Farley said he had been approached by the studio to complete Chris&#x27;s lines due to his voice sounding almost identical to his brother&#x27;s. While lamenting he wished he had completed the film for Chris, John admitted he just could not bring himself to do it at the time, even though Chris had five days left of line readings.

Farley was slated for another voice role in &quot;Dinosaur&quot; (2000) as a young male &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot; named Sorbus who, despite his gigantic stature, was frightened of heights. After his death, the character was rewritten as Baylene, an elderly female &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot; voiced by Joan Plowright.

At the time of his death, Farley had been in talks to co-star with Vince Vaughn in &quot;The Gelfin&quot;, and to star in a biographical film about comedian Fatty Arbuckle to be written by David Mamet. Jim Carrey&#x27;s role in the 1996 film &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; was originally intended for Farley, but scheduling conflicts forced him to decline. Farley was also offered the role of Ishmael (eventually played by Randy Quaid) in &quot;Kingpin&quot;, though he was forced by Paramount to turn it down to honor his commitment to star in &quot;Black Sheep&quot;.

Farley was slated to appear in a third &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; film, which was at the time intended to be about a new trio of Ghostbusters taking on overpopulation in Hell. Dav Pilkey, author of the children&#x27;s book series &quot;Captain Underpants&quot;, had wanted Farley to play the title role in a potential television series based on the books.

Farley had been in talks for the lead in an adaptation of the novel &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;. Farley even expressed interest in portraying Atuk in an adaptation of the novel &quot;The Incomparable Atuk&quot;. Both of these shelved projects, along with the Arbuckle biopic, have been alleged to be cursed as Farley, John Belushi, and John Candy were each attached to both roles, and all three died before any of the films entered production.

Two months before his death, Farley had a conversation with Spade about a hypothetical third film which would have starred the duo (based on the box office successes of &quot;Tommy Boy&quot; and &quot;Black Sheep&quot;). Although nothing was ever formalized, director Steven Surjik developed a script for a film named &quot;Tree&quot; with both Farley and Spade in mind. The plot was described as &quot;...involving a low-level White House employee who goes to the Pacific Northwest in search of a presidential Christmas tree. The White House staffer hooks up with a quirky truck driver and hijinks ensue&quot;, presumably with Spade as the White House employee and Farley as the truck driver.

==Personal life==
For most of his adult life, Farley battled alcohol and drug addiction. These addictions resulted in him being suspended from the cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Producer Lorne Michaels had little patience for Farley&#x27;s drug use (having had similar problems with John Belushi), and threatened to permanently dismiss Farley if he refused to obtain help. Bernie Brillstein, whose firm of Brillstein-Grey Entertainment managed Farley, had repeatedly sent Farley to drug and alcohol rehabilitation.

In 1997, there was a visible decline in Farley&#x27;s health. He made a guest appearance on Nickelodeon&#x27;s children&#x27;s sketch comedy show &quot;All That&quot;. The appearance proceeded without incident, but the physical comedy Farley was famous for was minimal, arguably because it was noticeable Farley was breathing heavily and struggling to perform.

On October 25, 1997, Farley made his final appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as a first-time host. The cold open featured Lorne Michaels doubting Farley&#x27;s ability to host, with Tim Meadows advocating that &quot;he will be calm, he will be focused, and he will be good... His party days are over.&quot; Chevy Chase was Farley&#x27;s &quot;sponsor&quot; in the sketch. Farley&#x27;s hoarse voice and flushed skin were the subject of public scrutiny. He had strained his vocal cords during rehearsal and his exhaustion was so noticeable the producers nearly cancelled his appearance. In the final years of his life, Farley had sought treatment for his weight and drug abuse on 17 occasions.

==Death==
On December 18, 1997, at 2:00 p.m. EST, Farley was found dead by his younger brother John in his apartment in the John Hancock Center in Chicago, at the age of 33. An autopsy revealed that Farley had died of an overdose of a combination of cocaine and heroin, commonly known as a &quot;speedball&quot;. Advanced atherosclerosis was cited as a &quot;significant contributing factor&quot;.
A private funeral was held for Farley on December 23 at Our Lady Queen of Peace Catholic Church in his hometown of Madison, Wisconsin. Over 500 people attended his funeral, including many comedians who had worked with him on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and on film, such as Dan Aykroyd, Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Rob Schneider, Lorne Michaels, Al Franken, John Goodman, Bob Odenkirk, Tim Meadows, Norm Macdonald, Robert Smigel, George Wendt, and Phil Hartman. Farley&#x27;s best friend, David Spade, was absent, fueling speculation that there was some falling out with Farley prior to his death. Years later Spade denied this, saying that his absence from the funeral was because he would have found it too emotionally difficult. Another funeral was held on January 13, 1998, at St. Monica Catholic Church. Farley&#x27;s remains were interred at Resurrection Cemetery in Madison.

==Legacy==
Farley&#x27;s career, private life, and early death have often been compared to that of his comedy idol John Belushi, who died at the same age and from a similar drug overdose.

On August 26, 2005, Farley was posthumously awarded the 2,289th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located in front of iO West. An authorized biography of Farley, &quot;The Chris Farley Show&quot;, was written by his brother Tom Jr. and Tanner Colby. The song &quot;Purple Stain&quot; from the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; 1999 album, &quot;Californication&quot;, contains the lyric &quot;Farley is an angel and I can prove this&quot; as a tribute to Farley.

A television documentary on his life &quot;I Am Chris Farley&quot; was shown on August 10, 2015. Farley was also the subject of the TV program, &quot;Autopsy: The Last Hours of Chris Farley&quot;, which premiered on November 19, 2016, on the Reelz channel.

In 2018, Adam Sandler wrote and performed an emotional tribute song dedicated to Farley in his Netflix stand-up special &quot;Adam Sandler: 100% Fresh&quot;. Netflix released the performance on YouTube later that year to commemorate the 21st anniversary of Farley&#x27;s death. Sandler later played the song live on an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; that he hosted on May 4, 2019.

On April 12, 2024, a Chris Farley biopic starring Paul Walter Hauser and directed by Josh Gad from a script by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber was announced to be in the works, with SNL creator Lorne Michaels set to produce. Later that month, New Line Cinema and Warner Bros. Pictures acquired the rights to the project for $2.5 million.

<text>Wildlife refers to undomesticated animals and uncultivated plant species which can exist in their natural habitat, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans. Wildlife was also synonymous to game: those birds and mammals that were hunted for sport. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, plains, grasslands, woodlands, forests, and other areas including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities. Some wildlife threaten human safety, health, property and quality of life. However, many wild animals, even the dangerous ones, have value to human beings. This value might be economic, educational, or emotional in nature.

Humans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife in a number of ways, including the legal, social and moral senses. Some animals, however, have adapted to suburban environments. This includes urban wildlife such as feral cats, dogs, mice, and rats. Some religions declare certain animals to be sacred, and in modern times, concern for the natural environment has provoked activists to protest against the exploitation of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment.

Global wildlife populations have decreased significantly by 68% since 1970 as a result of human activity, particularly overconsumption, population growth, and intensive farming, according to a 2020 World Wildlife Fund&#x27;s &quot;Living Planet Report&quot; and the Zoological Society of London&#x27;s Living Planet Index measure, which is further evidence that humans have unleashed a sixth mass extinction event. According to CITES, it has been estimated that annually the international wildlife trade amounts to billions of dollars and it affects hundreds of millions of animal and plant specimen.

== Interactions with humans ==

=== Trade ===
==== For food ====
 Stone Age people and hunter-gatherers relied on wildlife, both plants and animals, for their food. In fact, some species may have been hunted to extinction by early human hunters. Today, hunting, fishing, and gathering wildlife is still a significant food source in some parts of the world. In other areas, hunting and non-commercial fishing are mainly seen as a sport or recreation. Meat sourced from wildlife that is not traditionally regarded as game is known as bushmeat. The increasing demand for wildlife as a source of traditional food in East Asia is decimating populations of sharks, primates, pangolins and other animals, which they believe have aphrodisiac properties.

A November 2008 report from biologist and author Sally Kneidel, PhD, documented numerous wildlife species for sale in informal markets along the Amazon River, including wild-caught marmosets sold for as little as $1.60 (5 Peruvian soles). Many Amazon species, including peccaries, agoutis, turtles, turtle eggs, anacondas, armadillos are sold primarily as food.

=== Media ===

Wildlife has long been a common subject for educational television shows. National Geographic Society specials appeared on CBS since 1965, later moving to American Broadcasting Company and then Public Broadcasting Service. In 1963, NBC debuted &quot;Wild Kingdom,&quot; a popular program featuring zoologist Marlin Perkins as host. The BBC natural history unit in the United Kingdom was a similar pioneer, the first wildlife series LOOK presented by Sir Peter Scott, was a studio-based show, with filmed inserts. David Attenborough first made his appearance in this series, which was followed by the series Zoo Quest during which he and cameraman Charles Lagus went to many exotic places looking for and filming elusive wildlife—notably the Komodo dragon in Indonesia and lemurs in Madagascar.
Since 1984, the Discovery Channel and its spinoff Animal Planet in the US have dominated the market for shows about wildlife on cable television, while on Public Broadcasting Service the NATURE strand made by WNET-13 in New York and NOVA by WGBH in Boston are notable. Wildlife television is now a multimillion-dollar industry with specialist documentary film-makers in many countries including UK, US, New Zealand, Australia, Austria, Germany, Japan, and Canada.
There are many magazines and websites which cover wildlife including &quot;National Wildlife&quot;, &quot;Birds &amp; Blooms&quot;, &quot;Birding&quot;, wildlife.net, and &quot;Ranger Rick&quot; for children.

=== Religion ===
Many animal species have spiritual significance in different cultures around the world, and they and their products may be used as sacred objects in religious rituals. For example, eagles, hawks and their feathers have great cultural and spiritual value to Native Americans as religious objects. In Hinduism the cow is regarded as sacred.

Muslims conduct sacrifices on Eid al-Adha, to commemorate the sacrificial spirit of Ibrāhīm in Islam ( Arabic-Abraham) in love of God. Camels, sheep, goats may be offered as sacrifice during the three days of Eid.

In Christianity the Bible has a variety of animal symbols, the Lamb is a famous title of Jesus. In the New Testament the Gospels Mark, Luke and John have animal symbols: &quot;Mark is a lion, Luke is a bull and John is an eagle.&quot;

==Loss and extinction==
This subsection focuses on anthropogenic forms of wildlife destruction. The loss of animals from ecological communities is also known as &quot;defaunation.&quot;

Exploitation of wild populations has been a characteristic of modern man since our exodus from Africa 130,000 – 70,000 years ago. The rate of extinctions of entire species of plants and animals across the planet has been so high in the last few hundred years that it is widely believed that a sixth great extinction event (&quot;the Holocene Mass Extinction&quot;) is currently ongoing. The 2019 &quot;Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services&quot;, published by the United Nations&#x27; Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, says that roughly one million species of plants and animals face extinction within decades as the result of human actions. Subsequent studies have discovered that the destruction of wildlife is &quot;significantly more alarming&quot; than previously believed, with some 48% of 70,000 monitored animal species experiencing population declines as the result of human industrialization. According to a 2023 study published in &quot;PNAS&quot;, &quot;immediate political, economic, and social efforts of an unprecedented scale are essential if we are to prevent these extinctions and their societal impacts.&quot;

The four most general reasons that lead to destruction of wildlife include overkill, habitat destruction and fragmentation, impact of introduced species and chains of extinction.

===Overkill===
Overkill happens whenever hunting occurs at rates greater than the reproductive capacity of the population is being exploited. The effects of this are often noticed much more dramatically in slow-growing populations such as many larger species of fish. Initially when a portion of a wild population is hunted, an increased availability of resources (food, etc.) is experienced increasing growth and reproduction as density dependent inhibition is lowered. Hunting, fishing and so on, have lowered the competition between members of a population. However, if this hunting continues at rate greater than the rate at which new members of the population can reach breeding age and produce more young, the population will begin to decrease in numbers.

Populations that are confined to islands, whether literal islands or just areas of habitat that are effectively an &quot;island&quot; for the species concerned, have also been observed to be at greater risk of dramatic population rise of deaths declines following unsustainable hunting.

===Habitat destruction and fragmentation===

The habitat of any given species is considered its preferred area or territory. Many processes associated with human habitation of an area cause loss of this area and decrease the carrying capacity of the land for that species. In many cases these changes in land use cause a patchy break-up of the wild landscape. Agricultural land frequently displays this type of extremely fragmented, or relictual habitat. Farms sprawl across the landscape with patches of uncleared woodland or forest dotted in-between occasional paddocks.

Examples of habitat destruction include grazing of bushland by farmed animals, changes to natural fire regimes, forest clearing for timber production and wetland draining for city expansion. This is particularly challenging since wild animals cannot drink tap water, which means they cannot autonomously survive in those habitats where there is no surface water access.

===Impact of introduced species===
 Mice, cats, rabbits, dandelions and poison ivy are all examples of species that have become invasive threats to wild species in various parts of the world. Frequently species that are uncommon in their home range become out-of-control invasions in distant but similar climates. The reasons for this have not always been clear and Charles Darwin felt it was unlikely that exotic species would ever be able to grow abundantly in a place in which they had not evolved. The reality is that the vast majority of species exposed to a new habitat do not reproduce successfully. Occasionally, however, some populations do take hold and after a period of acclimation can increase in numbers significantly, having destructive effects on many elements of the native environment of which they have become part.

===Chains of extinction===
This final group is one of secondary effects. All wild populations of living things have many complex intertwining links with other living things around them. Large herbivorous animals such as the hippopotamus have populations of insectivorous birds that feed off the many parasitic insects that grow on the hippo. Should the hippo die out, so too will these groups of birds, leading to further destruction as other species dependent on the birds are affected. Also referred to as a domino effect, this series of chain reactions is by far the most destructive process that can occur in any ecological community.

Another example is the black drongos and the cattle egrets found in India. These birds feed on insects on the back of cattle, which helps to keep them disease-free. Destroying the nesting habitats of these birds would cause a decrease in the cattle population because of the spread of insect-borne diseases.

<text>The Tadjena massacre was an incident resulting in 81 deaths. Beginning about 9:00 p.m. on December 8 and continuing until early December 9, 1998, 81 villagers (45 according to the initial reports) were killed by armed groups in the mountain villages of Bouhamed and Ayachiche just north of Tadjena, some west of Algiers, in the Chlef region of western Algeria. The manner of killing is reported to have been notably sadistic, mutilating victims and burning corpses; CNN quoted a survivor as saying that &quot;attackers slashed the throats of children, cutting the arms and legs off one of them and throwing the body in a boiling pot.&quot; In addition, 20 women (8 according to initial reports) were kidnapped. Another 7 people had been killed there on the previous night. The massacre took place about ten days before the beginning of Ramadan.

The massacre was reported by a Member of Parliament in a televised parliamentary debate. The massacre site was later visited by the Interior Minister, Mostefa Bensamour. The authorities announced a manhunt for the murderers responsible on the national radio, and declared that a &quot;terrorist band&quot; was responsible. A nearby mountain was described as a major Armed Islamic Group (GIA) base; the GIA is thus presumed to be responsible. However (at least as of December 10, 1998) no group had admitted to the massacre.

Tadjena was later subjected to a second smaller massacre on the 25–26 May 2003, when 7 people were killed on the 25th and another 14 from a single family on the 26th.

<doc id="144230" wikidata="Q281020" url="?curid=144230" title="Pierre Louis Dulong">
<text>Pierre Louis Dulong FRS FRSE (; ; 12 February 1785 – 19 July 1838) was a French physicist and chemist. He is remembered today largely for the law of Dulong and Petit, although he was much-lauded by his contemporaries for his studies into the elasticity of steam, conduction of heat, and specific heats of gases. He worked most extensively on the specific heat capacity and the expansion and refractive indices of gases. He collaborated the co-discoverer of the Dulong–Petit law.

== Early life and education ==
Dulong was born in Rouen, France.

An only child, he was orphaned at the age of 4, he was brought up by his aunt in Auxerre. He gained his secondary education in Auxerre and the Lycée Pierre Corneille in Rouen before entering the École polytechnique, Paris in 1801, only for his studies to be impeded by poor health. He began studying medicine, but gave this up, possibly because of a lack of financial means, to concentrate on science, working under the direction of Louis Jacques Thénard.

== Career ==
In chemistry, he contributed to knowledge on:
* the double decomposition of salts (1811)
* nitrous acid (1815)
* the oxides of phosphorus (1816)
* the oxides of nitrogen
* catalysis by metals (1823, with Thénard).

Dulong also discovered the dangerously sensitive nitrogen trichloride in 1811, losing three fingers and an eye in the process. The fact that Dulong kept the accident a secret meant that Humphry Davy&#x27;s investigation of the compound had the same unfortunate consequence, although Davy&#x27;s injuries were less severe.

In addition to his accomplishments in chemistry, Dulong has been hailed as an interdisciplinary expert. His contemporaries in the Royal Society of London acknowledged his &quot;command of almost every department of physical science&quot;.

In 1815, Dulong collaborated for the first time with Alexis Thérèse Petit, in publishing a paper on heat expansion. The two would continue to collaborate, researching the specific heats of metals. In 1819, Dulong and Petit showed that the mass heat capacity of metallic elements are inversely proportional to their atomic masses, this being now known as the Dulong–Petit law. For this discovery Dulong was honored by the French Academy in 1818. This law helped develop the periodic table and, more broadly, the examination of atomic masses.

In 1820, Dulong succeeded Petit, who retired due to poor health, as professor of physics at École polytechnique. Dulong studied the elasticity of steam, the measurement of temperatures, and the behavior of elastic fluids. He studied how metals enabled the combinations of certain gases. He made the first precise comparison of the mercury- and air-temperature scales. In 1830, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

He died of stomach cancer in Paris. At the time of his death, he was working on the development of precise methods in calorimetry. His last paper, published the year of his death, examined the heat released from chemical reactions.

== Personality ==

Socially, Dulong was often dismissed as a dry, standoffish individual. His few friends disagreed with this view, viewing his personality as subdued rather than dull.According to a fellow physicist who compared Dulong and Petit:

Dulong was noted both for his devotion to science and the stolid, almost casual, bravery he displayed in prosecuting his experiments. One such experiment involved the construction of a glass tubular apparatus atop the tower at the Abbey of Saint Genevieve. The tower was unsteady enough that an explosion of the experimental materials, considerably likely considering their volatility, could easily have toppled the tower and killed the researching physicists, including Dulong. The experiment though &quot;full of danger and difficulty&quot;, was completed under Dulong&#x27;s leadership.

Another example of Dulong&#x27;s indifference to danger amid scientific pursuit came about in his studies into nitrogen trichloride. Despite losing two fingers and one eye in his initial experiments, Dulong continued to research the unknown substance. His inquiry led to more injuries, after which he turned over the results of his studies to Humphry Davy.

== Personal life ==
He was married to Emelie Augustine Riviere in 1803.

== Burial and honors ==
In life, Dulong poured the bulk of his finances into his scientific experiments. He was often destitute. As a result, he died without leaving his family any significant inheritance.

He is buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery. His monument was paid for by his scientific peers.

His is one of the names of 72 scientists inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.

<doc id="144231" wikidata="Q2529000" url="?curid=144231" title="EarthBound">
<text>EarthBound, originally released in Japan as is a 1994 role-playing video game developed by Ape Inc. and HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System as the second entry in the &quot;Mother&quot; series. The game focuses on Ness and his party of Paula, Jeff and Poo, as they travel the world to collect melodies from eight Sanctuaries in order to defeat the universal cosmic destroyer Giygas.

&quot;EarthBound&quot; had a lengthy development period that spanned five years. Its returning staff from &quot;Mother&quot; (1989) included writer/director Shigesato Itoi and lead programmer Satoru Iwata, as well as composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka, who incorporated a diverse range of styles into the soundtrack, including salsa, reggae, and dub. Most of the other staff members had not worked on the original &quot;Mother&quot;, and the game came under repeated threats of cancellation until Iwata joined the team. Originally scheduled for release in January 1993, the game was completed around May 1994 and first released in Japan in August 1994, and in North America in June 1995. A port for the Game Boy Advance developed by Pax Softnica, bundled with &quot;Mother&quot;, as &quot;Mother 1+2&quot;, was released only in Japan in 2003. 

Like its predecessor, &quot;EarthBound&quot; is themed around an idiosyncratic portrayal of Americana and Western culture, subverting popular role-playing game traditions by featuring a modern setting while parodying numerous staples of the genre. Itoi wanted the game to reach non-gamers with its intentionally goofy tone; for example, the player uses items such as the Pencil Eraser to remove pencil statues, experiences in-game hallucinations, and battles piles of vomit, taxi cabs, and walking nooses. For its American release, the game was marketed with a $2 million promotional campaign that sardonically proclaimed &quot;This game stinks&quot;. The game&#x27;s puns and humor were reworked by localizer Marcus Lindblom. Since the original &quot;Mother&quot; had not yet been released outside Japan, &quot;Mother 2&quot; was called &quot;EarthBound&quot; to avoid confusion about what it was a sequel to.

Although it was positively received by Japanese audiences, &quot;EarthBound&quot; sold poorly in the United States, which journalists attributed to a combination of its simple graphics, satirical marketing campaign, and a lack of market interest in the genre. In the ensuing years, a dedicated fan community spawned that advocated for the series&#x27; recognition, particularly after Ness appeared as a playable character in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. By the 2000s, multiple reader polls and critics had named it one of the greatest video games ever made, and it became regarded as a &quot;sacred cow among gaming&#x27;s &quot;. It was followed by the Japan-only sequel &quot;Mother 3&quot; for the Game Boy Advance in 2006. &quot;EarthBound&quot; was later made available worldwide on the Wii U Virtual Console in 2013, 3DS Virtual Console in 2016, the SNES Classic in 2017, and Nintendo Switch Online in February 2022.

==Gameplay==

&quot;EarthBound&quot; features many traditional role-playing game elements: the player controls a party of characters who travel through the game&#x27;s two-dimensional world composed of villages, cities, caves, and dungeons. Along the way, the player fights battles against enemies and the party receives experience points for victories. If enough experience points are acquired, a character&#x27;s level will increase. This pseudo-randomly increases the character&#x27;s attributes, such as offense, defense, and the maximum hit points (HP) and psychic points (PP) of each character. Rather than using an overworld map screen like most console RPGs of its era, the world is entirely seamless, with no differentiation between towns and the outside world. Another non-traditional element is the perspective used for the world. The game uses oblique projection, while most 2D RPGs use a &quot;top-down&quot; view on a grid or an isometric perspective.

Unlike its predecessor, &quot;Mother&quot;, &quot;EarthBound&quot; does not use random encounters. In &quot;EarthBound&quot;, enemies are presented similar to other non-player characters scattered around the game&#x27;s overworld. While the player can see enemy parties on-screen, the composition of the parties are randomly generated. If the player touches an enemy from the front or side while facing forward or sideways, the battle mode starts normally with no special advantage gained. Successfully approaching an enemy from behind allows the player and their party to make a free opening attack against the enemy before normal combat begins. If the enemy attacks from behind the player, the enemy makes a free opening attack that the player can dodge. In combat, once an enemy or character&#x27;s HP reaches zero, that enemy or character is rendered unconscious. There is a chance that the party will receive an item after the battle. Battle commands include attacking, spying (reveals enemy weakness), mirroring (emulates an enemy), and running away. Characters can also use PSI actions that require PP. Once each character is assigned a command, the characters and enemies perform their actions in an order determined by character speed and a random number generator. Whenever a character receives damage, the HP box gradually &quot;rolls&quot; down, similar to a mechanical counter. This allows players an opportunity to heal the character or win the battle before the counter hits zero, saving the character from being rendered unconscious. This mechanic does not apply to enemies, for whom unconsciousness is instantaneous and can be reversed only with healing PSI. If all characters are rendered unconscious, the game transitions to an endgame screen, asking if the player wants to continue. An affirmative response brings Ness, conscious, back to the last save point, with half the money on his person at the time of his defeat, and with other party members still unconscious. If the party contacts an enemy from behind (indicated by a translucent green swirl that fills the screen), the player is given a first-strike priority when battle mode begins. If the party contacts an enemy with their backs, the swirl is red, and the enemy is given first-strike priority. Neutral priority is indicated by a black swirl. Battles with weaker enemies are won automatically, forgoing the battle sequence, and weaker monsters will flee from Ness and his friends rather than chase them.

Currency is indirectly received from battles. Each time the party wins a battle, Ness&#x27;s father, who can also save the game&#x27;s progress, deposits money in an account that can be withdrawn at ATMs. In towns, players can buy weapons, armor, and items from stores. Weapons and armor can be equipped to increase character strength and defense, respectively. Items can be used for a number of purposes, such as healing. Towns also contain useful facilities such as hospitals where players can be healed for a fee.

==Plot==
&quot;EarthBound&quot; begins sometime in the 1990s, several years after the events of &quot;Mother&quot;, in the fictional country of Eagleland, a parody of the United States. A young boy named Ness is awoken by a nearby meteorite crash and investigates it with his neighbor, Pokey Minch, to find Pokey&#x27;s missing brother, Picky.

When Ness and Pokey arrive at the meteor&#x27;s crash site, it opens up: revealing a small, beetle-like creature from the future named Buzz-Buzz. He explains that in the future, an alien force named Giygas has enveloped and consumed the world in hatred and consequently turned animals, humans, and objects into malicious creatures. Buzz-Buzz instructs Ness to collect melodies in a Sound Stone from eight Sanctuaries located across the game&#x27;s world to preemptively stop the force, but is killed shortly thereafter when Pokey and Picky&#x27;s mother mistakes him for a dung beetle. During the player&#x27;s ascent to the meteorite crash, a man can be met who claims to have unearthed a golden statue called the &quot;Mani Mani&quot; which emits evil thoughts. This statue appears throughout the game, and is typically attributed to the evil forces of the game&#x27;s world.

On his journey to visit the sanctuaries, Ness stumbles upon Happy Happy Village: a village inhabited by a cult of hooded men in blue robes who worship the color blue. A young girl named Paula has been taken hostage by the group, who wish to utilize her psychic abilities. Ness subsequently rescues her, and faces the cult&#x27;s leader: a man named &quot;Mr. Carpainter&quot; who has fallen influence to the Mani Mani statue. Subsequently, they arrive in the zombie-infested Threed, where Ness and Paula fall prey to a trap. Paula telepathically instructs precocious child scientist Jeff in a Winters boarding school to rescue them, prompting Jeff to escape the school with the assistance of his friend Tony. Jeff reunites with his father, Doctor Andonuts, who utilizes a flying saucer-like device called the “Sky Runner” to fly him to Ness and Paula’s location: freeing the duo. They continue to Saturn Valley: a village filled with a species of bizarre creatures called Mr. Saturn who are being enslaved by a group of sentient barf piles led by “Master Belch” to produce &quot;Fly Honey&quot;. The group distracts him with a jar of the bizarre substance and defeats him, thus the Mr Saturn assist the party by allowing them passage to the city of Fourside: whereupon Paula is abducted. Ness and Jeff rescue him after visiting a bar and entering the psychedelic Moonside.

After making their way to the seaside resort Summers and consuming a “magic cake”, Ness has a vision of: Poo, the prince of Dalaam, undergoing &quot;Mu Training&quot; before joining the party as well. This training entails Poo having a vision in which all of his body parts are ripped from his being before his senses are dulled.

The party continues to travel to the Scaraba desert, the Deep Darkness swamp, another village of creatures called the Tenda and a forgotten underworld where dinosaurs live. When the Sound Stone is eventually filled, Ness visits Magicant, a surreal location in his mind where he fights his personal dark side. Upon returning to Eagleland, Ness and his party use the Phase Distorter to travel back in time to fight Giygas, transferring their souls into robots so as to not destroy their bodies through time travel. The group discovers a device that contains Giygas, but it is being guarded by Pokey, who has been aiding Giygas all along and is using alien technology. After being defeated in battle, Pokey turns the device off, releasing Giygas and forcing the group to fight the alien, whose infinite power transformed him into an incomprehensible embodiment of evil and insanity. During the fight, Paula reaches out to the inhabitants of Earth, and eventually the player, who prays for the children&#x27;s safety. The prayers manage to exploit Giygas&#x27; fatal weakness – human emotions – and defeat the alien, eradicating him from existence. In a post-credits scene, Ness, whose life has returned to normal following Giygas&#x27; defeat, receives a note from Pokey, who challenges Ness to come and find him.

==Development==

The first &quot;Mother&quot; was released for the NES in 1989. Its sequel, &quot;Mother 2&quot;, or &quot;EarthBound&quot;, was developed over five years by Ape and HAL, and published through Nintendo. The game was written and designed by Japanese author, musician, and advertiser Shigesato Itoi, and produced by Satoru Iwata, who became Nintendo&#x27;s president and CEO. &quot;Mother 2&quot; was made with a development team different from that of the original game, and most of its members were unmarried and willing to work all night on the project. &quot;Mother 2&quot; development took much longer than planned and came under repeated threats of cancellation. Itoi has said that the project&#x27;s dire straits were resolved when Iwata joined the team. Ape&#x27;s programming team had more members than HAL on the project. The HAL team (led by lead programmer Iwata) worked on the game programming, while the Ape team (led by lead programmer Kouji Malta) worked on specific data, such as the text and maps. They spent biweekly retreats together at the HAL office in view of Mount Fuji.

The game continues &quot;Mother&quot; story in that Giygas reappears as the antagonist (and thus did not die at the end of &quot;Mother&quot;) and the player has the option of choosing whether to continue the protagonist&#x27;s story by choosing whether to name their player-character the same as the original. He considered interstellar and interplanetary space travel instead of the confines of a single planet in the new game. After four months, Itoi scrapped the idea as cliché. Itoi sought to make a game that would appeal to populations that were playing games less, such as girls.

The &quot;Mother&quot; series titles are built on what Itoi considered &quot;reckless wildness&quot;, where he would offer ideas that encouraged his staff to contribute new ways of portraying scenes in the video game medium. He saw the titles foremost as games and not &quot;big scenario scripts&quot;. Itoi has said that he wanted the player to feel emotions such as &quot;distraught&quot; when playing the game. The game&#x27;s writing was intentionally &quot;quirky and goofy&quot; in character, and written in the Japanese kana script so as to give dialogue a conversational feel. Itoi thought of the default player-character names when he did not like his team&#x27;s suggestions. Many of the characters were based on real-life personalities. For instance, the desert miners were modeled on specific executives from a Japanese construction company. The final battle dialogue with Giygas was based on Itoi&#x27;s recollections of a traumatic scene from the Shintoho film &quot;The Military Policeman and the Dismembered Beauty&quot; that he had accidentally seen in his childhood. Itoi referred to the battle background animations as a &quot;video drug&quot;. The same specialist made nearly 200 of these animations, working solely on backgrounds for two years.

The idea for the rolling HP meter began with pachinko balls that would drop balls off the screen upon being hit. This did not work as well for characters with high health. Instead, around 1990, they chose an odometer-style hit points counter. The bicycle was one of the harder elements to implement—it used controls similar to a tank before it was tweaked. Iwata felt that the Ape programmers were particularly willing to tackle such challenges. The programmers also found difficulty implementing the in-game delivery service, where the delivery person had to navigate around obstacles to reach the player. They thought it would be funny to have the delivery person run through obstacles in a hurry on his way off-screen. The unusual maps laid out with diagonal streets in oblique projection required extra attention from the artists. Itoi specifically chose against having an overworld map, and didn&#x27;t want to artificially distinguish between towns and other areas. Instead, he worked to make each town unique. His own favorite town was Threed, though it was Summers before then.

&quot;Mother 2&quot; was designed to fit within an eight-megabit limit, but was expanded in size and scope twice: first to 12 megabits and second to 24 megabits. The game was originally scheduled for release in January 1993 on a 12 megabit cartridge. It was finished around May 1994 and the Japanese release was set for August 27. With the extra few months, the team played the game and added small, personal touches. Itoi told &quot;Weekly Famitsu&quot; that Shigeru Miyamoto liked the game and that it was the first role-playing game that Miyamoto had completed. &quot;Mother 2&quot; would release in North America about a year later.

The game includes anti-piracy measures that, when triggered, increases enemy counts to make the game less enjoyable. Additionally, right before players reach the end of the pirated copy&#x27;s story, their game resets and deletes its saved file in an act that IGN declared &quot;arguably the most devious and notorious example of &#x27;creative&#x27; copy protection&quot;.

===Music===

&quot;Mother&quot; composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka returned to make the &quot;EarthBound&quot; soundtrack, along with newcomers Hiroshi Kanazu and Toshiyuki Ueno. In comparison with &quot;Mother&quot;, Itoi said that &quot;EarthBound&quot; had more &quot;jazzy&quot; pieces. Suzuki told &quot;Weekly Famitsu&quot; that the Super NES afforded the team more creative freedom with its eight-channel ADPCM based SPC700, as opposed to the old Nintendo Entertainment System&#x27;s restriction of five channels of basic waveforms. This entailed higher sound quality and music that sounds closer to his regular compositions. The soundtrack was released by Sony Records on November 2, 1994.

In Suzuki&#x27;s songwriting process, he would first compose on a synthesizer before working with programmers to get it in the game. His personal pieces play when the player is walking about the map, out of battle. Suzuki&#x27;s favorite piece is the music that plays while the player is on a bicycle, which he composed in advance of this job but found appropriate to include. He wrote over 100 pieces, but much of it was not included in the game. The team wrote enough music as to fill eight megabits of the 24 megabit cartridge—about two compact discs.
According to Tanaka, the Beach Boys were repeatedly referenced between him and Suzuki, and that he would often listen to co-founder Brian Wilson&#x27;s 1988 eponymous album while on the way to Suzuki&#x27;s home. Suzuki has stated that the percussive arranging in the game&#x27;s soundtrack was based on the Beach Boys&#x27; albums &quot;Smile&quot; (unreleased) and &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; (1967), which both contained American themes shared with Van Dyke Parks&#x27; &quot;Song Cycle&quot; (1968). To Suzuki, &quot;Smile&quot; evoked the bright and dark aspects of America, while &quot;Song Cycle&quot; displayed a hazy sound mixed with American humor and hints of Ray Bradbury, a style that he considered essential to the soundtrack of &quot;Mother&quot;. Tanaka recalls Randy Newman being the first quintessentially American composer he could think of, and that his albums &quot;Little Criminals&quot; (1977) and &quot;Land of Dreams&quot; (1988) were influential. While Suzuki corroborated with his own affinity for Harry Nilsson&#x27;s &quot;Nilsson Sings Newman&quot; (1970), he also cited John Lennon as a strong influence due to the common theme of love in his music, which was also a prominent theme in the game, and that his album &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot; (1970) helped him to avoid excessive instrumentation over the SNES&#x27;s technical constraints.

The soundtrack contains direct musical quotations of some classical and folk music; the composers also derived a few samples culled from other sources including commercial pop and rock music. The texture of the work was partially influenced by some salsa, reggae, and dub music. Speaking about Frank Zappa&#x27;s &quot;Make a Jazz Noise Here&quot; (1991), Tanaka felt that Zappa would have been the best at creating a live performance of &quot;Mother&quot; music, but could not detail Zappa&#x27;s specific influence on &quot;EarthBound&quot;. Additionally, he felt that the mix tape &quot;Wired Magazine Presents: Music Futurists&quot; (1999) presented a particular selection of artists that embody the ethos of &quot;EarthBound&quot;, running the gamut from space age composer Esquivel to avant-garde trumpeter Ben Neill, along with innovators Sun Ra, Steve Reich, Todd Rundgren, Brian Eno, and Can. Tanaka also mentioned that he listened to the various artists compilation &quot;Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films&quot; (1988) heavily during &quot;EarthBound&quot;″s development. Miscellaneous influences on Suzuki and Tanaka for &quot;EarthBound&quot; include the music of Michael Nyman, Miklós Rózsa&#x27;s film score for &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; (1945), and albums by various other pop/rock musicians.

===English localization===

As was traditional for Nintendo, &quot;Mother 2&quot; was developed in Japan and localized in the United States, a process in which the game is translated into English for Western audiences. As it was the only game in the &quot;Mother&quot; series to be released in North America at the time, its title &quot;&quot;Mother 2&quot; was changed to &quot;EarthBound&quot;&quot; to avoid confusion about what it was a sequel to.

Nintendo of America&#x27;s Dan Owsen began the English localization project and converted about ten percent of the script before moving to another project. Marcus Lindblom filled Owsen&#x27;s position around January 1995. Lindblom credits Owsen with coining some of the game&#x27;s &quot;most iconic phrases&quot;, such as &quot;say fuzzy pickles&quot;. Lindblom himself was given liberties to make the script &quot;as weird as [he] wanted&quot;, as Nintendo wanted the script to be more American than a direct translation would be. He worked alone and with great latitude due to no divisional hierarchies. Lindblom was aided by Japanese writer Masayuki Miura, who translated the Japanese script and contextualized its tone, which Lindblom positively described as &quot;a glass half full&quot;.

Lindblom was challenged by the task of culturally translating &quot;an outsider&#x27;s view of the U.S.&quot; for an American audience. He also sought to stay true to the original text, though he never met or spoke with Itoi. In addition to reworking the original puns and humor, Lindblom added private jokes and American cultural allusions to Bugs Bunny, comedian Benny Hill, and &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;. Apart from the dialogue, he wrote the rest of the game&#x27;s text, including combat, prompts and item names. As one of several Easter eggs, he named a non-player character for his daughter, Nico, who was born during development. While Lindblom took the day off for her birth, he proceeded to work 14-hour days without weekends for the next month.

Under directives from Nintendo, Lindblom worked with the Japanese artists and programmers to remove references to intellectual property, religion, and alcohol from the American release, such as a truck&#x27;s Coca-Cola logo, the red crosses on hospitals, and crosses on tombstones. Alcohol became coffee or cappuccinos, Ness was no longer nude in the Magicant area as seen in the image, and the Happy Happyist blue cultists were made to look less like Ku Klux Klansmen. The team was not concerned with music licensing issues and considered itself somewhat protected under the guise of parody. Lindblom recalled that the music did not need many changes. The graphical fixes were not finished until March 1995, and the game was not fully playable until May.

==Reception==
===Sales and promotion===
In Japan, &quot;Mother 2&quot; sold 518,000 units, becoming the tenth best-selling game of 1994 within the country. &quot;EarthBound&quot; was released on June 5, 1995, in North America. The game sold about 140,000 units in the United States, for a total of approximately 658,000 units sold worldwide.

Though Nintendo spent about $2 million on marketing, the American release was ultimately viewed as unsuccessful within Nintendo. The game&#x27;s atypical marketing campaign was derived from the game&#x27;s unusual humor. As part of Nintendo&#x27;s larger &quot;Play It Loud!&quot; campaign, &quot;EarthBound&quot; &quot;this game stinks&quot; campaign included foul-smelling scratch and sniff advertisements. &quot;GamePro&quot; reported that they received more reader complaints about the game&#x27;s scratch and sniff ad than about any other 1995 advertisement. The campaign was also expensive. It emphasized magazine advertisements and had the extra cost of the strategy guide included with each game. Between the poor sales and the phasing out of the Super NES, the game did not receive a European release. Aaron Linde of &quot;Shacknews&quot; believed that the price of the packaged game ultimately curtailed sales.

===Contemporary===

&quot;EarthBound&quot; originally received little critical praise from the American press, and sold poorly in the US: around 140,000 copies, as compared to twice as many in Japan. &quot;Kotaku&quot; described &quot;EarthBound&quot; 1995 American release as &quot;a dud&quot; and blamed the low sales on &quot;a bizarre marketing campaign&quot; and graphics &quot;cartoonish&quot; beyond the average taste of players. The game was released when RPGs were not popular in the US, and visual taste in RPGs was closer to &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. The game piggybacked on Itoi&#x27;s celebrity in Japan.

Most journalists attributed the game&#x27;s poor sales in the US to its simple graphics, atypical marketing campaign, and disinterest in the genre. Of the original reviewers, Nicholas Dean Des Barres of &quot;DieHard GameFan&quot; wrote that &quot;EarthBound&quot; was not as impressive as &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot;, although just as fun. He praised the game&#x27;s humor and wrote that the game completely defied his first impressions. Des Barres wrote that &quot;past the graphics&quot;, which were purposefully 8-bit for nostalgia, the game is not an &quot;entry-level&quot; or a &quot;child&#x27;s&quot; RPG, but &quot;highly intelligent&quot; and &quot;captivating&quot;. The Brazilian &quot;Super GamePower&quot; explained that those expecting a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;-style RPG will be disappointed by the childish visuals, which were unlike other 16-bit games. They wrote that the American humor was too mature and that the gameplay was too immature, as if for beginners. &quot;GamePro&quot; was critical to the game&#x27;s storyline and graphics, but praised the music and the humor. They concluded that the game is inappropriate for children due to its adult humor, but would not appeal to more mature gamers due to its simplistic gameplay and poorly illustrated graphics.

Lindblom and his team were devastated by the release&#x27;s poor critical response and sales. He recalled that the game was hurt by the reception of its graphics as &quot;simplistic&quot; at a time when critics placed high importance on graphics quality. Lindblom felt that the game&#x27;s changes to the RPG formula (e.g., the rolling HP meter and fleeing enemies) were ignored in the following years, though he thought the game had aged well at the time of its Virtual Console rerelease in 2013.

===Retrospective===

Reviewing the game years after its release, writers described the game as &quot;original&quot; or &quot;unique&quot;, and praised its script&#x27;s range of emotions. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Scott Thompson said the game teetered between solemn and audacious in its dialogue and gameplay, and noted its deviance from RPG tropes in aspects such as choice of attacks in battle. He found the game both &quot;bizarre and memorable&quot;. &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; Simon Parkin thought the game&#x27;s script was its best asset, as &quot;one of the medium&#x27;s strongest and idiosyncratic storylines&quot; that fluctuated &quot;between humorous and poignant&quot;. &quot;GameZone&quot; David Sanchez thought its script was &quot;clever&quot; and &quot;sharp&quot;, as it displayed a wide range of emotions that made him want to talk to all non-player characters. &quot;GamesTM&quot; wrote that the game designers spoke with their players through the non-playable characters, and noted how Itoi&#x27;s interests shaped the script, its allusions to popular culture, and its &quot;strangely existential narrative framework&quot;. Nintendo Life praised the game&#x27;s touching story, charm and modern-day setting, with minor criticism of the slow pacing.

Critics praised its &quot;real world&quot; setting, which was seen as an uncommon choice. Thompson noted its 1990s homage as &quot;a love letter to 20th-century Americana&quot;, with a payphone as a save point, ATMs to transfer money, yo-yos as weapons, skateboarders and hippies as enemies, and references to classic rock bands. &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; Parkin noted the theme&#x27;s distance from the &quot;knights and dragons&quot; common to the Japanese role-playing game genre. Thompson noted the game&#x27;s steep difficulty. He wrote that the beginning was the hardest and that aspects such as limited inventory, experience grinds, and monetary penalties upon death were unfriendly for players new to Japanese RPGs. He also cited the quick respawn time for foes and ultimate need not to avoid battles given the difficulty of bosses.

Reviewers described the game&#x27;s ambiance as cheery and full of charm. David Sanchez of &quot;GameZone&quot; thought the game&#x27;s self-awareness added to its charm, where the player learned through the game&#x27;s poking lighthearted fun. He added that the music was an &quot;absolute delight&quot; and complimented its range from space sounds to themes to &quot;bizarre&quot; battle tracks that varied with the enemy type. &quot;GamesTM&quot; wrote that the game&#x27;s reputation comes from the &quot;consistent ... visual language&quot; in its Charles M. Schulz-esque character and world design. &quot;Kotaku&quot; Jason Schreier found the ending unsatisfying and unrelieving, despite finding the ending credits with its character curtain call and photo album of &quot;fuzzy pickles&quot; moments all &quot;wonderful&quot;.

Thompson wrote that &quot;EarthBound&quot; balances &quot;dark Lovecraftian apocalypse and silly lightheartedness&quot;, and was just as interesting nearly a decade after its original release. While he lamented a lack of &quot;visual feedback&quot; in battle animations, he felt the game had innovations that still feel &quot;smart and unique&quot;: the rolling HP meter and lack of random battles. Thompson also noted that technical issues like animation slowdown with multiple enemies on-screen went unfixed in the rerelease. Parkin found the game to provide a more potent experience than developers with more resources and thought its battle sequences were &quot;sleek&quot;. &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot;″s Justin Baker was surprised by the &quot;excellent&quot; battle system and controls, which he found to be underreported in other reviews despite their streamlined, grind-reducing convenience. He wrote that some of the menu interactions were clunky. &quot;GamesTM&quot; felt that the game was &quot;far from revolutionary&quot;, compared to &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; and &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, and that its battle scenes were unexciting. The magazine compared the game&#x27;s &quot;chosen one&quot; story to a &quot;throwaway &quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot;/&quot;Goonies&quot; hybrid narrative&quot;. Thompson praised Nintendo for digitizing the Player&#x27;s Guide, though noted that it was technically easier to view it on another tablet rather than switching the Wii U&#x27;s view mode. Reviewers concluded that the game had aged well.

==Legacy==
===Acclaim and influence===
&quot;EarthBound&quot; was listed in &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot;, where Christian Donlan wrote that the game is &quot;name-checked by the video gaming cognoscenti more often than it&#x27;s actually been played&quot;. He called the game &quot;utterly brilliant&quot; and praised its overworld and battle system. Similarly, &quot;Eurogamer&quot; Simon Parkin described it as a &quot;sacred cow amongst gaming&#x27;s cognoscenti&quot;. Game journalists have ranked &quot;EarthBound&quot; among the best Super NES games and most essential Japanese role-playing games, and at least three reader polls ranked the game among the best of all time. For a piece about the &quot;top worlds&quot; in video games, &quot;IGN&quot; rated &quot;EarthBound&quot; setting among the best, indelible between its unconventional environments, 1960s music, and portrayal of Americanism.

&quot;Kotaku&quot; described the game &quot;as one of the weirdest, most surreal role-playing games in RPG history&quot;. Examples include using items such as the Pencil Eraser to remove pencil statues, experiencing in-game hallucinations, meeting &quot;a man who turned himself into a dungeon&quot;, and battling piles of vomit, taxi cabs, and walking nooses. David Sanchez of &quot;GameZone&quot; wrote that &quot;EarthBound&quot; &quot;went places no other game would&quot; in the 1990s or even in the present day, including &quot;trolling&quot; the player &quot;before trolling was cool&quot;. Localization reviewer Clyde Mandelin described the Japanese-to-English conversion as &quot;top-notch for its time&quot;. &quot;1UP.com&quot; said it was &quot;unusually excellent&quot; for the time. &quot;IGN&quot; wrote that Nintendo was &quot;dead wrong&quot; for believing that Americans would not be interested in &quot;such a chaotic and satirical world&quot;. Complex included &quot;EarthBound&quot; as one of the &quot;Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time&quot;, saying the game is &quot;definitely the craziest and one of the most fun RPGs the SNES had to offer.

Jeremy Parish of &quot;USgamer&quot; called &quot;EarthBound&quot; &quot;the all-time champion&quot; of self-aware games that &quot;warp ... perceptions and boundaries&quot; and break the fourth wall, citing its frequent internal commentary about the medium and the final scenes where the player is directly addressed by the game. &quot;GamesTM&quot; said the game felt fresh because of its reliance on &quot;personal experiences&quot; made it &quot;exactly the sort of title that would thrive today as an indie hit&quot;. He called this accomplishment &quot;remarkable&quot; and credited Nintendo&#x27;s commitment to the &quot;voices of creators&quot;. IGN&#x27;s Nadia Oxford said that nearly two decades since the release, its final boss fight against Giygas continues to be &quot;one of the most epic video game standoffs of all time&quot; and noted its emotional impact. &quot;Kotaku&quot; wrote that the game was content to make the player &quot;feel lonely&quot;, and, overall, was special not for any individual aspect but for its method of using the video game medium to explore ideas impossible to explore in media.

The few role-playing games set in real-world settings, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; has written, are often and accurately described as having been influenced by &quot;EarthBound&quot;. It was cited as an influence on video games including &quot;Costume Quest&quot;; &quot;South Park: The Stick of Truth&quot; (via &quot;South Park&quot; creator Trey Parker); &quot;Undertale&quot;; &quot;Contact;&quot; &quot;Omori&quot;; &quot;Lisa&quot;; &quot;Citizens of Earth&quot;; &quot;&quot;; the webcomic Homestuck; and &quot;Kyoto Wild&quot;. Japanese writer Hiromi Kawakami told Itoi that she had played &quot;EarthBound&quot; &quot;about 80 times&quot;.

===Fandom===

A cult following for &quot;EarthBound&quot; developed after the game&#x27;s release. Colin Campbell of &quot;Polygon&quot; wrote that &quot;few gaming communities are as passionate and active&quot; as &quot;EarthBound&quot;, and &quot;1UP.com&quot; Bob Mackey wrote that no game was as poised to have a cult following. IGN&#x27;s Lucas M. Thomas wrote in 2006 that &quot;EarthBound&quot; &quot;persistent&quot;, &quot;ambitious&quot;, and &quot;religiously dedicated collective of hardcore fans&quot; would be among the first groups to influence Nintendo&#x27;s decision-making through their purchasing power on Virtual Console. &quot;Digital Trends&quot;″s Anthony John Agnello wrote that &quot;no video game fans have suffered as much as &quot;EarthBound&quot; fans&quot;, and cited Nintendo&#x27;s reluctance to release &quot;Mother&quot; series games in North America. &quot;IGN&quot; described the series as neglected by Nintendo in North America for similar reasons. Nintendo president Satoru Iwata later credited the community response on their online Miiverse social platform as leading to &quot;EarthBound&quot; eventual rerelease on their Virtual Console platform. Physical copies of &quot;EarthBound&quot; were hard to find before the rerelease, and in 2013, were worth twice its initial retail price.

&quot;Wired&quot; described the amount of &quot;EarthBound&quot; &quot;fan art, videos, and tributes on fan sites like &quot;EarthBound&quot; Central or &quot;Starmen.net&quot; as mountainous. Reid Young of &quot;Starmen.net&quot; and &quot;Fangamer&quot; credits &quot;EarthBound&quot; popularity to its &quot;labor of love&quot; nature, with a &quot;double-coat of thoughtfulness and care&quot; across all aspects of the game by a development team that appeared to love their work. Young started the fansite that would become &quot;Starmen.net&quot; in 1997 while in middle school. It became &quot;the definitive fan community for &quot;EarthBound&quot; on the web&quot; and had &quot;almost inexplicable&quot; growth. &quot;Shacknews&quot; described the site&#x27;s collection of fan-made media as &quot;absolutely massive&quot;. It also provided a place to aggregate information on the &quot;Mother&quot; series and to coordinate fan actions.

The &quot;EarthBound&quot; fan community at &quot;Starmen.net&quot; coalesced with the intent to have Nintendo of America acknowledge the &quot;Mother&quot; series. The community drafted several thousand-person petitions for specific English-language &quot;Mother&quot; series releases, but in time, their request shifted to no demand at all, wanting only their interest to be recognized by Nintendo. A 2007 campaign for a &quot;Mother 3&quot; English localization led to the creation of a full-color, 270-page art book—&quot;The EarthBound Anthology&quot;—sent to Nintendo and press outlets as demonstration of consumer interest. &quot;Shacknews&quot; called it more of a proposal than a collection of fan art, and &quot;the greatest gaming love letter ever created&quot;. Upon &quot;little&quot; response from Nintendo, they decided to localize the game themselves. Starmen.net co-founder and professional game translator Clyde &quot;Tomato&quot; Mandelin led the project from its November 2006 announcement to October 2008 finish. They then printed a &quot;professional quality strategy guide&quot; through &quot;Fangamer&quot;, a video game merchandising site that spun off from &quot;Starmen.net&quot;. Unlicensed &quot;EarthBound&quot;-themed merchandise produced by &quot;Fangamer&quot; contributors included T-shirts, a pin set and a mug; &quot;The Verge&quot; cited the effort as proof of the fan base&#x27;s dedication.

Other fan efforts include &quot;EarthBound, USA&quot;, a full-length documentary on &quot;Starmen.net&quot; and the fan community, and &quot;Mother 4&quot;, a fan-produced sequel to the &quot;Mother&quot; series that went into production when Itoi definitively &quot;declared&quot; that he was done with the series. After following the fan community from afar, Lindblom came out to fans in mid-2012 and the press became interested in his work. He had planned a book about the game&#x27;s development, release, and fandom before a reply from Nintendo discouraged him from pursuing the idea. He plans to continue to communicate directly with the community about the game&#x27;s history. Books that have been written about &quot;EarthBound&quot; include Ken Baumann&#x27;s &quot;Earthbound&quot;, by Boss Fight Books, and &quot;Legends of Localization Book 2: Earthbound&quot;, by Clyde Mandelin.

===Ness===

A variety of merchandise depicting Ness have been produced by Nintendo; this merchandise includes a figurine and an Amiibo. Ness became widely known for his appearance as a playable character throughout the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; fighting game series, debuting as a fighter in the first installment in 1999. Ness&#x27;s inclusion in the original release was among its biggest surprises, and renewed &quot;Mother&quot; series fans&#x27; faith in new content from Nintendo. Ness was one of the game&#x27;s most powerful characters, according to &quot;IGN&quot;, if players could perfect his odd controls and psychic powers. In Europe, which did not see an &quot;EarthBound&quot; release, Ness was better known for his role in the fighting game than for his original role in the role-playing game.

Ness returned in the first sequel, &quot;Melee&quot;, alongside an &quot;EarthBound&quot;-themed item and battle arena. Lucas, the protagonist of &quot;Mother 3&quot;, joined Ness in &quot;Brawl&quot;. Several years after &quot;Brawl&quot; release, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; wrote that Ness was an unpopular &quot;Smash&quot; character who should be removed from future installments. However, Ness returned in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot; and &quot;Ultimate&quot;, and Lucas was later added to the former as downloadable content.

===Sequels and rereleases===

In 1996, Nintendo announced a sequel to &quot;EarthBound&quot; for the Nintendo 64: &quot;Mother 3&quot; (&quot;EarthBound 64&quot; in North America). It was scheduled for release on the 64DD, a Nintendo 64 expansion peripheral that used a magneto-optical drive, but struggled to find a firm release date as its protracted development entered development hell. It was later canceled altogether in 2000 when the 64DD flopped. In April 2003, a Japanese television advertisement revealed that both &quot;Mother 3&quot; and a combined &quot;Mother 1+2&quot; cartridge were in development for the handheld Game Boy Advance. &quot;Mother 3&quot; abandoned the Nintendo 64 version&#x27;s 3D, but kept its plot. It became a bestseller upon its Japanese release in 2006, yet did not receive a North American release on the basis that it would not sell. &quot;IGN&quot; described the series as neglected by Nintendo in North America, as &quot;Mother 1&quot;, &quot;Mother 1+2&quot; and &quot;Mother 3&quot; were not released outside Japan.

When Nintendo launched its digital distribution platform, Virtual Console, for the Wii in 2006, &quot;IGN&quot; expected &quot;EarthBound&quot; to be among Nintendo&#x27;s highest priorities for rerelease, given the &quot;religious&quot; dedication of its fanbase. Though the game was ranked the most desired Virtual Console release by &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; readers, rated for release by the ESRB, and able to be published with little effort, the Wii version did not materialize. Many fans believed that music licensing or legal concerns impeded the rerelease. English localizer Marcus Lindblom doubted that the game&#x27;s music samples were an issue, since they were not a concern during development, and instead hypothesized that Nintendo did not realize the magnitude of the game&#x27;s popular support and did not consider it a priority project. By 2008, it was not apparent that Nintendo of America was considering a rerelease. At the end of 2012, Itoi revealed that the re-release was moving forward, which was confirmed in a January 2013 Nintendo Direct presentation.

As part of the anniversary celebrations for the Nintendo Entertainment System and &quot;Mother 2&quot; in March 2013, Nintendo rereleased &quot;EarthBound&quot; for Japan on the Wii&#x27;s successor, the Wii U Virtual Console. &quot;EarthBound&quot; producer Satoru Iwata soon announced a wider rerelease, citing fan interest on Nintendo&#x27;s Miiverse social platform. The July American and European launch included a free, online recreation of the game&#x27;s original Player&#x27;s Guide, optimized for viewing on the Wii U GamePad. The game was a top-seller on the Wii U Virtual Console, and both &quot;Kotaku&quot; users and first-time &quot;EarthBound&quot; players had an &quot;overwhelmingly positive&quot; response to the game. Simon Parkin wrote that its re-release was a &quot;momentous occasion&quot; as the return of &quot;one of Nintendo&#x27;s few remaining lost classics&quot; after 20 years. The re-release was one &quot;GameSpot&quot; editor&#x27;s game of the year, and &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; Virtual Console game of the year. The New Nintendo 3DS-specific Virtual Console received the re-release the next year, in March 2016. In September 2017, Nintendo released the Super NES Classic Edition, which included &quot;EarthBound&quot; among its games. Japan&#x27;s version of the console however, did not include the game.

In February 2022, Nintendo rereleased &quot;EarthBound&quot; worldwide on its Nintendo Switch Online service along with its predecessor &quot;EarthBound Beginnings&quot;.

<doc id="144232" wikidata="Q3297462" url="?curid=144232" title="Sanaa school shooting">
<text>The Sanaa school shooting was a school shooting where Mohammad Ahman al-Nazari killed 6 people in Sanaa, Yemen on 30 March 1997. Nazari was convicted for the killings and sentenced to death. He was executed a week later.

== Background ==
Nazari was a 48-year-old resident of Sanaa, Yemen, and a veteran of the Soviet–Afghan War, where he had fought alongside the Mujahideen against the Soviet Union during their invasion of Afghanistan. Nazari&#x27;s five children attended the Tala&#x27;i Private School in the Asbahi neighbourhood of Sana&#x27;a, where it was alleged that one of his daughters had been molested by the school administrator, despite lack of evidence to confirm the allegation. Nazari had also previously been employed as a bus driver for Tala&#x27;i Private School and the nearby Musa Bin Nusayr School but was fired for unknown reasons sometime before the shooting.

== Shooting == 
Armed with an Kalashnikov assault rifle, Nazari waited at the school for the headmistress and killed her by shooting her in the head. After which he killed a teacher and three other school attendees, Nazari did this by entering the school building and shooting indiscriminately at teachers and students alike. Subsequently, he went to the nearby Musa Bin Nusayr School, where he continued his shooting rampage. A total of 11 other people from both schools were injured. Both schools were damaged with bullet holes in the walls and exterior of the schools.

== Eye witness reports == 
Eyewitness (1) Male, said he first saw the headmistress lying on the floor bloodied up, (pointing to the exact area), &quot;and another staff member dead at the other side, then as we tried attending to the dead, gunmen starting shooting again, so we ran and we hid from him and then as we came out again and we saw him opening fire on the other side and then the soldiers showed up, he starting shooting at them and was finally shot and captured by them.&quot;

Eyewitness (2) Male, said that in the beginning he was sleeping and heard gunfire which woke him up immediately. The witness then stepped out of the door and saw somebody dead. Then he ducked for cover and then saw the gunmen hop in his bus and head to a neighbouring school where he killed a child, then the witness said: &quot;We saw him but he then disappeared again and I then saw the headmistress lying on the floor and then the gunmen started firing again (in the neighbouring school)&quot;.

== Arrest and conviction ==
Nazari managed to kill six and wound 11 before he was eventually injured and arrested by police. After officially being declared sane, Nazari (whose name was also reported as being Hassan Ali al-Baadani or Muhammad Ahmad al-Naziri) was taken to trial where he was found guilty for the six murders, and sentenced to death the next day. Nazari&#x27;s daughters had fought against the courts pleading that their father was mentally unstable, the court refused this plead stating that the defendant had clearly shown the ability to attend court and conduct himself in a fit manner, as well as being checked by 3 different doctors at the Al Sabeen hospital; who all stated that the defendant was fit enough to understand the severity and seriousness of his actions. The following day, the Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Salah visited some of those injured in the attack.

=== Execution ===
On 5 April 1997, Nazari was executed by firing squad with five shots in the chest, in an empty lot located between the two schools where he had committed the shootings. After his execution, the initial sentence for Nazari&#x27;s corpse to be crucified in a public area for three days was repealed, instead the corpse was kicked to a pulp by angry citizens and burned in the streets of Sanaa.

The daughter who the school administrator allegedly raped committed suicide five years later, while Nazari&#x27;s other four children reportedly all died in an accident in 2006.

==Victims==
*Asma Abd al-Bari, headmistress of Tala&#x27;i school
*Muhammad Yahya al-Ulufi, a teacher at Tala&#x27;i school
*Husayn Ali Qa&#x27;id al-Ba&#x27;dani
*Ali Muhammad Muqbil al-Awadi 
*Imad Muhammad al-Raymi
*Unidentified student

<text>The Firth of Clyde, is the estuary of the River Clyde, on the west coast of Scotland. The Firth has some of the deepest coastal waters of the British Isles. The Firth is sheltered from the Atlantic Ocean by the Kintyre Peninsula. The Firth lies between West Dunbartonshire in the north, Argyll and Bute in the west and Inverclyde, North Ayrshire and South Ayrshire in the east. The Kilbrannan Sound is a large arm of the Firth, separating the Kintyre Peninsula from the Isle of Arran. The Kyles of Bute separates the Isle of Bute from the Cowal Peninsula. The Sound of Bute separates the islands of Bute and Arran.

The Highland Boundary Fault crosses the Firth. The Firth also played a vital military role during World War II.

The Firth is sometimes called the Clyde Waters or Clyde Sea, and is customarily considered to be part of the Irish Sea.

==Geography==

At the north of the Firth, Loch Long and the Gare Loch join the Firth; these lochs are separated by the Rosneath Peninsula. Off Greenock, an anchorage, known as the Tail of the Bank narrows the estuary of the River Clyde to wide. (&quot;The &quot;Bank&quot; is a reference to a sandbank and shoal&quot;) The River Clyde estuary has an upper tidal limit located at the tidal weir next to Glasgow Green.

The geographical (and popular) distinction between the Firth and the River Clyde is vague. Some refer to Dumbarton as being &quot;on the &quot;Firth of Clyde&quot;&quot;; while at the same time, the residents of Port Glasgow and Greenock often refer to the part of the Firth that lies to the north of those areas as &quot;the river&quot;.

The Firth encompasses many islands and peninsulas. Twelve ferry routes connect them to each other and the mainland. The majority of the ferry services are run by Caledonian MacBrayne and one by Western Ferries, and many of the routes are lifeline services for communities living in remote areas. The Firth has no fixed link transport infrastructure connections (bridge or tunnel), linking the shores or islands. The lowest fixed crossing over the Clyde is the Erskine Bridge, opened on 2 July 1971.

The Irish Sea and the Firth of Clyde&#x27;s southerly boundary, as defined by the Scottish Government, is between the southern tip of the Kintyre Peninsula and Corsewall Point on the Rhins of Galloway.

The Firth joins the strait between Scotland and Northern Ireland, called the North Channel, at the north of the Irish Sea. The deepest part of the channel is the Beaufort&#x27;s Dyke, at .

=== Highland Boundary Fault ===
The Highland Boundary Fault enters the Firth off the east coast of Kintyre Peninsula in the south. The fault crosses the south eastern tip of the Cowal Peninsula at Toward Point, where it can be seen on the surface by the presence of Old Red Sandstone. The fault continues to Helensburgh in the north, then continues past the east coast of Scotland. The fault can be followed across Scotland for at least , the fault is of great age and its remains are broken by more recent geological movement of the earths crust.

===Sea Lochs===

Fourteen sea lochs join the Firth, the largest being Loch Fyne.

===Peninsulas===

* Cowal Peninsula

The Cowal Peninsula extends into the Firth of Clyde and forms the main western shoreline of the upper Firth. The main town on the Cowal Peninsula is Dunoon. Ardlamont Point on the Ardlamont Peninsula, that extends off of the Cowal Peninsula, is the southern tip of the Ardlamont and Cowal Peninsulas.

The ferries across the Firth save time compared to traveling &quot;round by road&quot;, via Loch Eck side (A815 road), the Rest and Be Thankful (A83 road) and Loch Lomond side (A82 road).The service between Dunoon and Gourock in Inverclyde is operated by Caledonian MacBrayne, the Public Service provider. This service carries only foot passengers and connects directly with the ScotRail service to Glasgow.Western Ferries, is a Private Limited Company, it operates the service between Hunters Quay and McInroy&#x27;s Point near to Gourock. This service carries all types of vehicular transport, as well as foot passengers.

* Kintyre Peninsula

The Kintyre peninsula forms the main west coastline of the lower Firth.

* Rosneath Peninsula

The Rosneath peninsula is formed by the Gare Loch in the east, and Loch Long in the west, both merge with the upper Firth of Clyde. There is a Caledonian MacBrayne passenger only service across the Firth to Gourock from Kilcreggan.

===Firth Islands===


There are many islands in the Firth. The largest three all have thriving communities and regular ferry services connecting them to the mainland. They are:

*Arran
*Bute
*Great Cumbrae

Ailsa Craig is a small island, formed by the remains of a volcanic plug in the Firth. Ailsa Craig Common Green Granite and Ailsa Craig Blue Hone Granite are quarried there for the production of Curling Stones, manufactured by Kays of Scotland.

Holy Isle a small island lying in Lamlash Bay, Isle of Arran. At the north of the Holy Isle there is a religious resort.

===Firth Lighthouses===

The Northern Lighthouse Board is responsible for some of the navigation aids around Scotlands coast. With others being the responsibility of the local Competent Harbour Authority.


There are lighthouses at:

There are navigation beacons at:

*The Gantocks Rocks and Navigation Beacon, off the coast at Dunoon, Cowal Peninsula.
*Horse Isle Beacon, Horse Isle, Ardrossan Built 1811.

===Firth shoreline settlements===


==Nature and conservation==
The Field Studies Council has a marine research station, based in Millport, on the island of Great Cumbrae.

Common seals and grey seals abound in the Firth. Harbour porpoises are also common. While dolphins are much less common, some were spotted in the upper reaches of the Firth in the summer of 2005. Very uncommon are humpback whales, as are the minke whales. Even rarer are orcas.

Also, in 2005, the Firth had the second-highest number of basking shark sightings in Scotland (after the Minch). These huge sharks seem to particularly favour the warm, shallow waters surrounding Pladda, south of Arran.

However, although commercial fishing was at one time intensive in the Firth&#x27;s many fishing towns, today the only catches of commercial interest remaining in the Clyde waters are prawns, lobsters, herring, mussels, and crayfish.

===Conservation===


On 5 September 2000, the Inner Clyde Estuary received a RAMSAR designation. Site number: 1036. The area covered is . (Coordinates: 55°56&#x27;32&quot;N 04°36&#x27;32&quot;W)

In September 2008, Scotland&#x27;s first No Take Zone (NTZ) was introduced in Lamlash Bay, on the Isle of Arran. The result of a community effort, led by the Community of Arran Seabed Trust (C.O.A.S.T). The NTZ was introduced to protect delicate marine communities, such as Maerl. Maerl is a slow-growing coral-like calcareous red algae (it grows only 1 mm per year) and is an important Scottish species. Maerl beds are locations of high biodiversity and are crucial nursery grounds for both young scallops and young fish. Studies show that both scallop dredging and organic waste from fish farms, significantly impact Maerl. Scallop dredging on a Maerl bed has been found to kill over 70% of the Maerl. Monitoring the dredged bed over the next four years found no discernible recovery, suggesting that Maerl beds would require many years free of disturbance in order to recover.

In 2014, at the south of the Firth between Kintyre Peninsula and the Rhins of Galloway, on the North Channel boundary. Designated a Marine Protected Area, the (Clyde Sill MPA), the NatureScot Site Code is 10414, the EU Site Code is 555560461. The MPA covers a distinctive sill where fresher water of the Firth mixes with the cooler, more saline water of the North Channel. This is a rich environment for plankton, which provide food for fish, that are in turn eaten by higher marine predators and seabirds.

On 16 December 2015, an area to the south of Arran received a Marine Protected Area designation.

===Water quality===

The water quality of the Firth is monitored by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). SEPA have had a monitoring buoy located off the coast of Dunoon since 2009, with data collected every 15 minutes.

==Shipping==

The Firth of Clyde has some of the deepest sea channels in Northern Europe. It can accommodate the largest Capesize vessels afloat today. As a result, the Clyde has one of the UK&#x27;s leading ports, at Clydeport, part of The Peel Group. The facility handles cargo from container ships at the Greenock Ocean Terminal.

Supertankers visit the Firth to deliver crude oil to Finnart Oil Terminal in Loch Long, which is connected by pipeline to the Grangemouth Refinery on the Firth of Forth. Both owned by Petroineos, a joint venture between Ineos and Petrochina. A second pipeline brings back refined oil products to the Finart Oil Terminal for export (in smaller oil tankers) mainly to Northern Ireland.

===Shipyards===


On the upper Clyde, at Govan and Scotstoun both in Glasgow, two major shipyards are still in operation. They are owned by BAE Systems, whose major client is the Royal Navy.

On the lower Clyde, only one shipyard still operates, Ferguson Marine, which is located next to Newark Castle, Port Glasgow. The Scottish Government now own the yard.

The Garvel Dry Dock in Greenock continues in operation for ship repair. The large Inchgreen Dry Dock in Greenock is in occasional use.

The remains of former sites of shipyards on the Clyde are being redeveloped into areas that contain residential housing, leisure facilities, and commercial buildings.

On the Firth itself, Ardmaleish Boatbuilding are based at Ardmaleish, near to Port Bannatyne on the Isle of Bute.

===Cruise terminal===

The Greenock Cruise Terminal, operated by Clydeport part of The Peel Group. A new twin berth terminal was opened on 25 August 2023.

====Visiting liners====

====Historic liner visits====

* &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;

===Shipwrecks===

Shipwreck diving is a popular activity on the Firth, with many wreck sites to explore. Military wrecks have protection under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986.

====Salvaged wrecks====

* &quot;Comet II&quot;, launched in 1821, collision and sank 21 October 1825, salvaged 21 July 1826.
* HMS &quot;K13&quot;, submarine, sank 29 January 1917, salvaged 15 March 1917.
* &quot;Varyag&quot;, grounded and sank 5 February 1920, salvaged (scrapped where beached 1924 - 1926).
* &quot;Maillé Brézé&quot;, 30 April 1931, Lost by accidental explosion. Salvaged summer of 1954.
* HMS &quot;Untamed&quot;, submarine, sank 30 May 1943, salvaged 5 July 1943.

The Royal Navy has a significant presence on the Firth of Clyde. HMNB Clyde is known as Faslane within the navy and is located on Loch Long. HMNB Clyde&#x27;s role is with the servicing and maintenance of the UK submarine defence fleet. The base has other locations around the Firth.

Babcock International are involved in the engineering and operations at the base.

On Loch Long, at Glen Mallan, the Northern Ammunition Jetty was refurbished, to accommodate the navy’s new aircraft carriers, HMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; and HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, with work completed in January 2022. The jetty is part of the DM Glen Douglas military munitions depot. Plans have been announced in February 2024 to demolish an undisclosed part of the site.

==History==

The Firth of Clyde has always been an important sea route from the earliest times. For example, the Battle of Largs, which was fought on the Firth, in 1263, was a geopolitical turning point: it marked the end of Norse ambitions in Britain. Beginning in the 16th century, the Firth increasingly became a conduit for commercial and industrial products, including: herring; timber; wine; sugar; tobacco; textiles; iron and steel; coal; oil; industrial chemicals; distillation and brewing; ships, locomotives, and other vehicles; and other manufactured products.

In the middle of the 19th century, the sport of yachting became popular on the Firth. The area became famous worldwide for its significant contribution to yachting and yachtbuilding with notable designers including: William Fife III; Alfred Mylne; G L Watson; David Boyd. It was also the location of many famous yacht yards. Clyde-built wooden yachts are still known for quality and style today.

The &quot;lower Clyde&quot; shipyards of Greenock and Port Glasgow, most notably Scott Lithgow, played an important historical role in shipbuilding. The was the first successful steamboat in Europe. Well into the 20th century, a large proportion of the world&#x27;s ship construction took place around the upper Firth and River Clyde.

===Tourism===

With the advent of tourism in Victorian times, the Firth became popular with Glaswegians and residents of neighbouring towns and counties who travelled &quot;doon the watter&quot; (the Firth) on Clyde steamers to holiday in the picturesque seaside towns and villages that line the Firth, with the more wealthy building substantial holiday homes along its coasts. Many towns, such as Gourock, Largs, Ayr, Dunoon, Rothesay, flourished during this period and became fully fledged resorts with well-appointed hotels and attractions. Golf courses, including major championship courses, proliferated.

Today, tourism, sport and recreation, and heritage history continue to attract visitors from across the world. The steam-powered —in addition to its regular service—still makes cruising trips to the coastal towns that have been popular tourist destinations since the 19th century. The Firth is ringed by many castles and buildings of historical importance that are open to the public, including Inveraray Castle, Brodick Castle, the opulent Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute, and Culzean Castle, which is the most visited attraction owned by the National Trust for Scotland. Ocean liners frequently call at Greenock, and Glasgow International Airport and Glasgow Prestwick Airport are nearby. There is frequent rail service to and from the Clyde coast, including links to Oban and Fort William, with city terminals in Glasgow and Edinburgh. There is also daily ferry service between the area and Belfast.

===Sport and recreation===

====1908 Summer Olympic Games====

The Firth hosted the 1908 summer olympics, with the sailing yacht races.

===Shipyards===
The Firth of Clyde, like the River Clyde, has historically been an important centre of shipbuilding and shipping. Upriver, there have been shipbuilding and engineering centres at Glasgow, Govan, Clydebank, Dumbarton, and Renfrew. Downriver, there have been major yards at Greenock and Port Glasgow; smaller yards at Irvine, Ardrossan, Troon, and Campbeltown; and various other boatyards, including those at Hunters Quay, Port Bannatyne, and Fairlie. Today, the Ferguson Marine shipbuilding yard, adjacent to Newark Castle, Port Glasgow, is the last merchant shipbuilder on the Clyde, and it is owned by the Scottish Government. In Greenock, the large dry dock and ship-repair facilities at Inchgreen opened in 1964, and were subsequently taken over by Scott Lithgow. The dry dock there is long and wide. With the demise of Scott Lithgow and Cammell Laird, their facilities came under the management of Clydeport.

===Ports===

The Hunterston Ore Terminal was constructed to facilitate the transport of bulk ore, but later mainly dealt with coal imports, and closed in 2016.

The ExxonMobil (ESSO) Fuel Oil Terminal site at Bowling.

There was a jetty built as part of Inverkip Power Station, for oil deliveries by oil tanker.

===Armed Forces===

HMS &quot;Gannet&quot;, the Fleet Air Arm Search and Rescue site at Prestwick Airport. The helicopters (Sea King) that were based here were used in the rescue and airlift operations across the United Kingdom. The base was closed on 1 January 2016, with Maritime and Coastguard Agency taking over the role.

====Submarine Squadron 14====

Cold War; The United States of America maintained a US Navy base during the Cold War, in the Holy Loch, off the Firth. Submarine Squadron 14 or SUBRON14, also known as &quot;Site one, Holy Loch&quot; was in operation between 1 July 1958, up until the end of the Cold War. The last deployed Submarine Tender departed the Holy Loch and Firth on 3 March 1992.

World War II; During World War II, Glasgow and the Firth of Clyde became the main entry point into Britain for the Allied forces’, including merchant shipping, military personnel, and equipment. The Firth was used as the assembly and despatch point, for Atlantic convoys. The Firth hosted the United Kingdoms largest naval base for the duration of the war. In 1942, a underwater oil pipeline was laid across the Firth, Operation Pluto, the world&#x27;s first deep-water test of this technology. This was only one of many innovations designed to support air, maritime, and territorial combat during World War II.

The Holy Loch was used as a base for Royal Navy Submarines, during World War II. Namely the 3rd Submarine Flotilla (United Kingdom). HMS &quot;Forth&quot; was for a time based in the loch as the submarine depot ship.

During both World wars, the Cloch Point To Dunoon Anti-submarine Boom was in place to protect the upper Firth.

===Environment===

Since the Industrial Revolution, the natural environment of the Firth has been compromised. Many locations have been affected by a succession of industrial and military developments along the shoreline. Including the former sites of shipyards; Hunterston B nuclear power station; Inverkip power station; ExxonMobil fuel oil terminal site at Bowling; Nobel explosives plant at Ardeer and the Hunterston Ore Terminal. Many of these locations are now dormant or being redeveloped.

==Climate==

The Firth&#x27;s maritime climate is considerably milder than contintental locations at the same latitide. Whilst the reason for this mild climate is the subject of debate it is historically considered to be due to the moderating influence of the North Atlantic Drift, a warm oceanic current that is the eastern extension of the Gulf Stream which originates in the tropical waters of the Gulf of Mexico.

==Concerns==

Worldwide, human-made causes including the over-exploitation and the pollution of water systems, are among the biggest threats and concerns which are damaging aquatic ecosystems and in extreme cases cause ecological death.

The durability of plastic&#x27;s in the natural environment, plastic pollution, imposes threats on aquatic life and the aquatic ecosystems. Plastic debris may result in entanglement and ingestion by aquatic life such as birds, fish and marine mammals, causing severe injury or death. Human livelihoods and life itself can also be impacted by plastic pollution. In severe cases, with effects on surrounding tourism or real estate value, the clogging of drains and other hydraulic infrastructure leading to increased flood risk and further pollution.

<doc id="144240" wikidata="Q4950159" url="?curid=144240" title="Bourgeois liberalization">
<text>[[Bourgeois]] liberalization () is a term used by the Chinese Communist Party to refer to either the prevalent political orientation of Western representative democracy or mainstream Western popular culture. The late 1980s saw the first major usage of the term when a number of campaigns, such as the Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign, against bourgeois liberalism were initiated lasting until the early 1990s. The term is in active use in Chinese politics, with the Communist Party&#x27;s Constitution stating party objectives include &quot;combat[ing] bourgeois liberalization&quot; in line with the four cardinal principles. According to the Chinese Communist Party, the concept of bourgeois liberalization was first proposed by Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader of China, in early 1980s.

Deng argued that liberalization would destroy political and economical stability, making it difficult for development to take place. He defined the idea of liberalization as &quot;inherently and completely capitalist&quot;, dismissing the existence of liberalization of proletariat or communism, and stated that the idea of liberalization was to try to turn them towards liberalism and capitalism, and thus needed to be strongly opposed on the ground of &quot;Realpolitik&quot;.

Due to the 1986 Chinese student demonstrations, Hu Yaobang, then General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and a leading reformist, was forced to resign from his post by Deng Xiaoping in early 1987. Left-wing conservatives such as Deng Liqun and Hu Qiaomu, under the support of Chen Yun and Li Xiannian (and even Deng himself), continued to launch the &quot;Anti-Bourgeois Liberalization Campaign&quot; in 1987. Zhao Ziyang, then Premier of China, successor to Hu as General Secretary and a leading reformist as well, eventually convinced Deng that the left-wing conservatives took advantage of the campaign to oppose the Reform and Opening-up program. In the end, Deng agreed to terminate the campaign in mid-1987 and supported the on-going political forms. In 2018, the Communist Party under general secretary Xi Jinping revised regulations on Party disciplinary action, expelling members from the Party if they openly adhere to bourgeois liberalization online.

<doc id="144241" wikidata="Q145623" url="?curid=144241" title="Molar mass">
<text>In chemistry, the molar mass () (sometimes called molecular weight or formula weight, but see related quantities for usage) of a chemical compound is defined as the ratio between the mass and the amount of substance (measured in moles) of any sample of the compound. The molar mass is a bulk, not molecular, property of a substance. The molar mass is an &quot;average&quot; of many instances of the compound, which often vary in mass due to the presence of isotopes. Most commonly, the molar mass is computed from the standard atomic weights and is thus a terrestrial average and a function of the relative abundance of the isotopes of the constituent atoms on Earth. The molar mass is appropriate for converting between the mass of a substance and the amount of a substance for bulk quantities.
The molecular mass (for molecular compounds) and formula mass (for non-molecular compounds, such as ionic salts) are commonly used as synonyms of molar mass, differing only in units (daltons vs g/mol); however, the most authoritative sources define it differently. The difference is that molecular mass is the mass of one specific particle or molecule, while the molar mass is an average over many particles or molecules.
The molar mass is an intensive property of the substance, that does not depend on the size of the sample. In the International System of Units (SI), the coherent unit of molar mass is kg/mol. However, for historical reasons, molar masses are almost always expressed in g/mol.
The mole was defined in such a way that the molar mass of a compound, in g/mol, is numerically equal to the average mass of one molecule or formula unit, in daltons. It was exactly equal before the redefinition of the mole in 2019, and is now only approximately equal, but the difference is negligible for all practical purposes. Thus, for example, the average mass of a molecule of water is about 18.0153 daltons, and the molar mass of water is about 18.0153 g/mol.
For chemical elements without isolated molecules, such as carbon and metals, the molar mass is computed dividing by the number of moles of atoms instead. Thus, for example, the molar mass of iron is about 55.845 g/mol.
Since 1971, SI defined the &quot;amount of substance&quot; as a separate dimension of measurement. Until 2019, the mole was defined as the amount of substance that has as many constituent particles as there are atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12. During that period, the molar mass of carbon-12 was thus &quot;exactly&quot; 12 g/mol, by definition. Since 2019, a mole of any substance has been redefined in the SI as the amount of that substance containing an exactly defined number of particles, . The molar mass of a compound in g/mol thus is equal to the mass of this number of molecules of the compound in grams.

== Molar masses of elements ==
The molar mass of atoms of an element is given by the relative atomic mass of the element multiplied by the molar mass constant, ≈ 1 g/mol. For normal samples from Earth with typical isotope composition, the atomic weight can be approximated by the standard atomic weight or the conventional atomic weight.
: formula_1

Multiplying by the molar mass constant ensures that the calculation is dimensionally correct: standard relative atomic masses are dimensionless quantities (i.e., pure numbers) whereas molar masses have units (in this case, grams per mole).

Some elements are usually encountered as molecules, e.g. hydrogen (), sulfur (), chlorine (). The molar mass of molecules of these elements is the molar mass of the atoms multiplied by the number of atoms in each molecule:
: formula_2

== Molar masses of compounds ==
The molar mass of a compound is given by the sum of the relative atomic mass of the atoms which form the compound multiplied by the molar mass constant formula_3:
: formula_4

Here, is the relative molar mass, also called formula weight. For normal samples from earth with typical isotope composition, the standard atomic weight or the conventional atomic weight can be used as an approximation of the relative atomic mass of the sample. Examples are: formula_5

An average molar mass may be defined for mixtures of compounds. This is particularly important in polymer science, where there is usually a molar mass distribution of non-uniform polymers so that different polymer molecules contain different numbers of monomer units.

== Average molar mass of mixtures ==

The average molar mass of mixtures formula_6 can be calculated from the mole fractions of the components and their molar masses :
: formula_7

It can also be calculated from the mass fractions of the components:
: formula_8

As an example, the average molar mass of dry air is 28.96 g/mol.

== Related quantities ==

Molar mass is closely related to the relative molar mass () of a compound and to the standard atomic weights of its constituent elements. However, it should be distinguished from the molecular mass (which is confusingly &quot;also&quot; sometimes known as molecular weight), which is the mass of &quot;one&quot; molecule (of any &quot;single&quot; isotopic composition), and to the atomic mass, which is the mass of &quot;one&quot; atom (of any &quot;single&quot; isotope). The dalton, symbol Da, is also sometimes used as a unit of molar mass, especially in biochemistry, with the definition 1 Da = 1 g/mol, despite the fact that it is strictly a unit of mass (1 Da = 1 u = , as of 2022 CODATA recommended values).

Obsolete terms for molar mass include gram atomic mass for the mass, in grams, of one mole of atoms of an element, and gram molecular mass for the mass, in grams, of one mole of molecules of a compound. The gram-atom is a former term for a mole of atoms, and gram-molecule for a mole of molecules.

Molecular weight (M.W.) (for molecular compounds) and formula weight (F.W.) (for non-molecular compounds), are older terms for what is now more correctly called the relative molar mass (). This is a dimensionless quantity (i.e., a pure number, without units) equal to the molar mass divided by the molar mass constant.

=== Molecular mass ===

The molecular mass () is the mass of a given molecule: it is usually measured in daltons (Da or u). Different molecules of the same compound may have different molecular masses because they contain different isotopes of an element. This is distinct but related to the molar mass, which is a measure of the average molecular mass of all the molecules in a sample and is usually the more appropriate measure when dealing with macroscopic (weigh-able) quantities of a substance.

Molecular masses are calculated from the atomic masses of each nuclide, while molar masses are calculated from the standard atomic weights of each element. The standard atomic weight takes into account the isotopic distribution of the element in a given sample (usually assumed to be &quot;normal&quot;). For example, water has a molar mass of , but individual water molecules have molecular masses which range between () and ().

The distinction between molar mass and molecular mass is important because relative molecular masses can be measured directly by mass spectrometry, often to a precision of a few parts per million. This is accurate enough to directly determine the chemical formula of a molecule.

=== DNA synthesis usage ===
The term formula weight has a specific meaning when used in the context of DNA synthesis: whereas an individual phosphoramidite nucleobase to be added to a DNA polymer has protecting groups and has its &quot;molecular weight&quot; quoted including these groups, the amount of molecular weight that is ultimately added by this nucleobase to a DNA polymer is referred to as the nucleobase&#x27;s &quot;formula weight&quot; (i.e., the molecular weight of this nucleobase within the DNA polymer, minus protecting groups).

== Precision and uncertainties ==
The precision to which a molar mass is known depends on the precision of the atomic masses from which it was calculated (and very slightly on the value of the molar mass constant, which depends on the measured value of the dalton). Most atomic masses are known to a precision of at least one part in ten-thousand, often much better (the atomic mass of lithium is a notable, and serious, exception). This is adequate for almost all normal uses in chemistry: it is more precise than most chemical analyses, and exceeds the purity of most laboratory reagents.

The precision of atomic masses, and hence of molar masses, is limited by the knowledge of the isotopic distribution of the element. If a more accurate value of the molar mass is required, it is necessary to determine the isotopic distribution of the sample in question, which may be different from the standard distribution used to calculate the standard atomic mass. The isotopic distributions of the different elements in a sample are not necessarily independent of one another: for example, a sample which has been distilled will be enriched in the lighter isotopes of all the elements present. This complicates the calculation of the standard uncertainty in the molar mass.

A useful convention for normal laboratory work is to quote molar masses to two decimal places for all calculations. This is more accurate than is usually required, but avoids rounding errors during calculations. When the molar mass is greater than 1000 g/mol, it is rarely appropriate to use more than one decimal place. These conventions are followed in most tabulated values of molar masses.

== Measurement ==
Molar masses are almost never measured directly. They may be calculated from standard atomic masses, and are often listed in chemical catalogues and on safety data sheets (SDS). Molar masses typically vary between:
: 1–238 g/mol for atoms of naturally occurring elements;
: for simple chemical compounds;
: for polymers, proteins, DNA fragments, etc.

While molar masses are almost always, in practice, calculated from atomic weights, they can also be measured in certain cases. Such measurements are much less precise than modern mass spectrometric measurements of atomic weights and molecular masses, and are of mostly historical interest. All of the procedures rely on colligative properties, and any dissociation of the compound must be taken into account.

=== Vapour density ===

The measurement of molar mass by vapour density relies on the principle, first enunciated by Amedeo Avogadro, that equal volumes of gases under identical conditions contain equal numbers of particles. This principle is included in the ideal gas equation:
: formula_9
where is the amount of substance. The vapour density () is given by
: formula_10
Combining these two equations gives an expression for the molar mass in terms of the vapour density for conditions of known pressure and temperature:
: formula_11

=== Freezing-point depression ===

The freezing point of a solution is lower than that of the pure solvent, and the freezing-point depression () is directly proportional to the amount concentration for dilute solutions. When the composition is expressed as a molality, the proportionality constant is known as the cryoscopic constant () and is characteristic for each solvent. If represents the mass fraction of the solute in solution, and assuming no dissociation of the solute, the molar mass is given by
: formula_12

=== Boiling-point elevation ===

The boiling point of a solution of an involatile solute is higher than that of the pure solvent, and the boiling-point elevation () is directly proportional to the amount concentration for dilute solutions. When the composition is expressed as a molality, the proportionality constant is known as the ebullioscopic constant () and is characteristic for each solvent. If represents the mass fraction of the solute in solution, and assuming no dissociation of the solute, the molar mass is given by
: formula_12

<text>Alexis Thérèse Petit (; 2 October 1791 – 21 June 1820) was a French physicist.

Petit is known for his work on the efficiencies of air- and steam-engines, published in 1818 (&quot;Mémoire sur l’emploi du principe des forces vives dans le calcul des machines&quot;). His well-known discussions with the French physicist Sadi Carnot, founder of thermodynamics, may have stimulated Carnot in his reflexions on heat engines and thermodynamic efficiency. The Dulong–Petit law (1819) is named after him and his collaborator Pierre Louis Dulong.

==Biography==

=== Early life and studies ===
Petit was born in Vesoul, Haute-Saône. At the age of 10, he proved that he was already capable of taking the difficult entrance exam to France&#x27;s most prestigious scientific school of the time, the École polytechnique of Paris. He was then placed in a preparatory school where he actually served as a &quot;répétiteur&quot; to help his own classmates digest the course material. He duly entered the Polytechnique at the lowest permissible age, in 1807, and graduated &quot;hors-rang&quot; in 1809 (which is to say that he clearly outranked all of his classmates).

After graduation, Petit stayed at Polytechnique as a faculty member, first as &quot;répétiteur&quot; in analysis and mechanics (1809) then in physics (1810). 

=== Career ===
He taught for some time at Lycée Bonaparte. At Polytechnique, he served as a substitute (1814) for Jean Henri Hassenfratz whom he would replace in 1815. He thus became the second professor of physics at Polytechnique and the youngest person ever to hold that position, at the age of 23.

Petit and François Arago were brothers-in-law because they married two sisters. In 1814, the two men collaborated on a paper together.

Petit first collaborated with Pierre Louis Dulong for the competition of the French Academy of Sciences about refrigeration (1815). Petit is now probably best known for the surprising Dulong–Petit law concerning the specific heat capacity of metals, which both men formulated together in 1819 and which Albert Einstein explained almost a century later. Petit also designed a special thermometer (using weights) to determine the thermal dilatation coefficients of several metals.

=== Death ===
Petit died from tuberculosis at the age of 28, shortly after the passing of his wife. He was succeeded by Dulong as professor of physics at the Polytechnique in 1820.

== Personality ==
Jules Jamin, a contemporary and fellow physicist provides biographical and temperament details of Petit and Dulong:

<doc id="144246" wikidata="Q4825923" url="?curid=144246" title="Author surrogate">
<text>As a literary technique, an author surrogate (also called an author avatar) is a fictional character based on the author. The author surrogate may be disguised, with a different name, or the author surrogate may be quite close to the author, with the same name. Some authors use author surrogates to express philosophical or political views in the narrative. Authors may also insert themselves under their own name into their works.

==Usage==
===Fiction===
Frequently, the author surrogate is the same as the main character and/or the protagonist, and is also often the narrator. As an example, the author surrogate may be the one who delivers political diatribe, expressing the author&#x27;s beliefs, or expound on the strengths and weaknesses of other characters, thereby communicating directly the author&#x27;s opinion on the characters in question. 
Philosophers and writers may use author-surrogates to express their personal positions, especially if these are unpopular or run counter to established views.

British writer David Hume used the author-surrogate &#x27;Philo&#x27; in the &quot;Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion&quot;. Philonous was the author-surrogate of the Irish philosopher George Berkeley in his work &quot;Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous&quot;. Novelist Michael Crichton used his character Ian Malcolm to express views on catastrophic system failure in his novel &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. Perhaps the best-known philosophical author-surrogate is Socrates in the writings of Plato.

A surrogate&#x27;s life may be very similar to that of the author. Like his creator, Peter Marlowe—a character in James Clavell&#x27;s novels—wrote about his experience as a prisoner of war with the Japanese during World War II, became a Hollywood writer, and visited Hong Kong to research a book on its trading companies.

Most stories have an author surrogate, insofar as the author is usually capable of pointing to one character (major or minor) whom he or she identifies with to a much greater degree than any other character. This can take the form of a realistic depiction of the author (Benjamin in &quot;Animal Farm&quot;), or a negative (Woody Allen in many of his films) or positive depiction of the author.

Steve Gerber depicted himself saving the universe in his final issue of &quot;Man-Thing&quot; for Marvel Comics, and Chris Claremont did the same, while Gerber&#x27;s act was passive and Claremont&#x27;s had him merge briefly with the title character. In both cases, the authors had other characters that were more traditional author surrogates, Richard Rory and Jonh Daltry.

In &quot;Animal Man&quot;, Grant Morrison appears as the author who controls the title character&#x27;s actions. For example, they tell Buddy Baker that the next writer could have him eating meat (which in fact did happen, in a bizarre set of circumstances), and Buddy says, &quot;But I don&#x27;t eat meat,&quot; to which Morrison retorts, &quot;No, I don&#x27;t eat meat.&quot;

Colombian author and Nobel laureate Gabriel García Márquez appears near the end of his own book, &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; as a minor character in the novel.

===Fan fiction===

Fan fiction critics have evolved the term Mary Sue to refer to an idealized author surrogate. The term &#x27;Mary Sue&#x27; is thought to evoke the cliché of an author who uses writing as a vehicle for the indulgence of self-idealization, to create a character that is so competent or perfect that it lacks verisimilitude. For male author surrogates, similar names such as &#x27;Marty Stu&#x27; or &#x27;Gary Stu&#x27; are occasionally used.
In fan fiction, an author surrogate is more commonly called a &quot;self-insert&quot;.

<text>Flagellation (Latin , &#x27;whip&#x27;), flogging or whipping is the act of beating the human body with special implements such as whips, rods, switches, the cat o&#x27; nine tails, the sjambok, the knout, etc. Typically, flogging has been imposed on an unwilling subject as a punishment; however, it can also be submitted to willingly and even done by oneself in sadomasochistic or religious contexts.

The strokes are typically aimed at the unclothed back of a person, though they can be administered to other areas of the body. For a moderated subform of flagellation, described as &quot;bastinado&quot;, the soles of a person&#x27;s bare feet are used as a target for beating (see foot whipping).

In some circumstances the word &quot;flogging&quot; is used loosely to include any sort of corporal punishment, including birching and caning. However, in British legal terminology, a distinction was drawn (and still is, in one or two colonial territories) between &quot;flogging&quot; (with a cat o&#x27; nine tails) and &quot;whipping&quot; (formerly with a whip, but since the early 19th century with a birch). In Britain these were both abolished in 1948.

==Current use as punishment==

Officially abolished in most countries, flogging or whipping, including foot whipping in some countries, is still a common punishment in some parts of the world, particularly in countries using Islamic law and in some territories which were former British colonies. Caning is routinely ordered by the courts as a penalty for some categories of crime in Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and elsewhere.

=== Syria ===
In Syria, where torture of political dissidents, POWs and civilians is extremely common, flagellation has become one of the most common forms of torture. Flagellation is used by both the Free Syrian Army and the Syrian Arab Army, but is not practiced by the Syrian Democratic Forces. ISIS most commonly used flagellation in which people would be tied to a ceiling and whipped. It was extremely common in Raqqa Stadium, a makeshift prison where prisoners were tortured. It was also common for those who did not follow ISIS strict laws to be publicly flogged.

==Historical use as punishment ==

===Judaism===
According to the Torah (Deuteronomy 25:1–3) and Rabbinic law lashes may be given for offenses that do not merit capital punishment, and may not exceed 40. However, in the absence of a Sanhedrin, corporal punishment is not practiced in Jewish law. Halakha specifies the lashes must be given in sets of three, so the total number cannot exceed 39. Also, the person whipped is first judged whether they can withstand the punishment, if not, the number of whips is decreased. Jewish law limited flagellation to forty strokes, and in practice delivered thirty-nine, so as to avoid any possibility of breaking this law due to a miscount.

===Antiquity===

In the Roman Empire, flagellation was often used as a prelude to crucifixion, and in this context is sometimes referred to as &quot;scourging&quot;. Most famously according to the gospel accounts, this occurred prior to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Due to the context of the flagellation of Jesus, the method and extent may have been limited by local practice, though it was done under Roman law.

Whips with small pieces of metal or bone at the tips were commonly used. Such a device could easily cause disfigurement and serious trauma, such as ripping pieces of flesh from the body or loss of an eye. In addition to causing severe pain, the victim would approach a state of hypovolemic shock due to loss of blood.

The Romans reserved this treatment for non-citizens, as stated in the and , dating from 195 and 123 BC. The poet Horace refers to the (horrible whip) in his &quot;Satires&quot;. Typically, the one to be punished was stripped naked and bound to a low pillar so that he could bend over it, or chained to an upright pillar so as to be stretched out. Two lictors (some reports indicate scourgings with four or six lictors) alternated blows from the bare shoulders down the body to the soles of the feet. There was no limit to the number of blows inflicted—this was left to the lictors to decide, though they were normally not supposed to kill the victim. Nonetheless, Livy, Suetonius and Josephus report cases of flagellation where victims died while still bound to the post. Flagellation was referred to as &quot;half death&quot; by some authors, as many victims died shortly thereafter. Cicero reports in , &quot;&quot; (&quot;taken away for a dead man, shortly thereafter he was dead&quot;).

===From Middle Ages to modern times===

The Whipping Act was passed in England in 1530. Under this legislation, vagrants were to be taken to a nearby populated area &quot;and there tied to the end of a cart naked and beaten with whips throughout such market town till the body shall be bloody&quot;.

In England, offenders (mostly those convicted of theft) were usually sentenced to be flogged &quot;at a cart&#x27;s tail&quot; along a length of public street, usually near the scene of the crime, &quot;until his [or her] back be bloody&quot;. In the late seventeenth century, however, the courts occasionally ordered that the flogging should be carried out in prison or a house of correction rather than on the streets. From the 1720s courts began explicitly to differentiate between private whipping and public whipping. Over the course of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the proportion of whippings carried out in public declined, but the number of private whippings increased. The public whipping of women was abolished in 1817 (after having been in decline since the 1770s) and that of men ended in the early 1830s, though not formally abolished until 1862.

Private whipping of men in prison continued and was not abolished until 1948. The 1948 abolition did not affect the ability of a prison&#x27;s visiting justices (in England and Wales, but not in Scotland, except at Peterhead) to order the birch or cat for prisoners committing serious assaults on prison staff. This power was not abolished until 1967, having been last used in 1962. School whipping was outlawed in publicly funded schools in 1986, and in privately funded schools in 1998 to 2003.

Whipping occurred during the French Revolution, though not as official punishment. On 31 May 1793, the Jacobin women seized a revolutionary leader, Anne Josephe Theroigne de Mericourt, stripped her naked, and flogged her on the bare bottom in the public garden of the Tuileries. After this humiliation, she refused to wear any clothes, in memory of the outrage she had suffered. She went mad and ended her days in an asylum after the public whipping.

In the Russian Empire, knouts were used to flog criminals and political offenders. Sentences of a hundred lashes would usually result in death. Whipping was used as a punishment for Russian serfs.

Ashraf Fayadh (born 1980), a Saudi Arabian poet, was imprisoned for eight years and lashed 800 times, rather than receiving a death penalty, for apostasy in 2016. In April 2020, Saudi Arabia said it would replace flogging with prison sentences or fines, according to a government document.

===Use against slaves===

Whipping has been used as a form of discipline on slaves. It was routinely carried out during the period of slavery in the United States, by slave owners and their slaves. The power was also given to slave &quot;patrolers,&quot; an early form of police forces who were authorized to whip any slave who violated the slave codes. Historians have shown that President George Washington approved of the whipping of enslaved people. According to historian Michael Dickman, &quot;[Slave-owners] used the whip as a tool to enforce this vision of society. Slaves, on the other hand, through their victimization and punishment, viewed the whip as the physical manifestation of their oppression under slavery.” In 1863, a photo known as &quot;Whipped Peter&quot; circulated widely. The photo depicts an enslaved man who bears welts across his back from being whipped. The image sparked outcry against the brutality of slavery, and contributed to anti-slavery sentiment during the Civil War.

===Flogging as military punishment===
In the 18th and 19th centuries, European armies administered floggings to common soldiers who committed breaches of the military code.

====United States====
During the American Revolutionary War, the American Congress raised the legal limit on lashes from 39 to 100 for soldiers who were convicted by courts-martial.

Prior to 1815 United States Navy captains were given wide discretion in matters of discipline. Surviving ships logs reveal the majority awarded between twelve and twenty-four lashes, depending on the severity of the offense. However, a few such as captain Isaac Chauncey awarded one hundred or more lashes. In 1815 the United States Navy placed a limit of twelve lashes, a captain of a naval vessel, could award. More severe infractions were to be tried by court martial. As critics of flogging aboard the ships and vessels of the United States Navy became more vocal, the Department of the Navy began in 1846 to require annual reports of discipline including flogging, and limited the maximum number of lashes to 12. These annual reports were required from the captain of each naval vessel. See thumbnail for the 1847 disciplinary report of the . The individual reports were then compiled so the Secretary of the Navy could report to the United States Congress how pervasive flogging had become and to what extent it was utilized. In total for the years 1846–1847, flogging had been administered a reported 5,036 times on sixty naval vessels. At the urging of New Hampshire Senator John P. Hale, the United States Congress banned flogging on all U.S. ships in September 1850, as part of a then-controversial amendment to a naval appropriations bill. Hale was inspired by Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;vivid description of flogging, a brutal staple of 19th century naval discipline&quot; in Melville&#x27;s &quot;novelized memoir&quot; &quot;White Jacket&quot;. During Melville&#x27;s time on the USS United States from 1843 to 1844, the ship log records 163 floggings, including some on his first and second days (18 and 19 August 1843) aboard the frigate at Honolulu, Oahu. Melville also included an intense depiction of flogging, and the circumstances surrounding it, in his more famous work, &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;.

Military flogging was abolished in the United States Army on 5 August 1861.

==== United Kingdom ====
Flagellation was so common in England as punishment that caning (and spanking and whipping) are called &quot;the English vice&quot;.

Flogging was a common disciplinary measure in the Royal Navy that became associated with a seaman&#x27;s manly disregard for pain. Generally, officers were not flogged. However, in 1745, a cashiered British officer&#x27;s sword could be broken over his head, among other indignities inflicted on him. Aboard ships, knittles or the cat o&#x27; nine tails was used for severe formal punishment, while a &quot;rope&#x27;s end&quot; or &quot;starter&quot; was used to administer informal, on-the-spot discipline. During the period 1790–1820, flogging in the British Navy on average consisted of 19.5 lashes per man. Some captains such as Thomas Masterman Hardy imposed even more severe penalties. Hardy while commanding , 1803–1805, raised punishments from the prior twelve lashes and twenty-four for more serious offenses to a new standard of thirty-six lashes with sixty lashes reserved for more serious infractions, such as theft or second offenses.

In severe cases a person could be &quot;flogged around the fleet&quot;: a significant number of lashes (up to 600) was divided among the ships on a station and the person was taken to all ships to be flogged on each, or—when in harbour—bound in a ship&#x27;s boat which was then rowed among the ships, with the ships&#x27; companies called to attention to observe the punishment.

In June 1879 a motion to abolish flogging in the Royal Navy was debated in the House of Commons. John O&#x27;Connor Power, the member for Mayo, asked the First Lord of the Admiralty to bring the navy cat o&#x27; nine tails to the Commons Library so that the members might see what they were voting about. It was the Great &quot;Cat&quot; Contention, &quot;Mr Speaker, since the Government has let the cat out of the bag, there is nothing to be done but to take the bull by the horns.&quot; Poet Laureate Ted Hughes celebrates the occasion in his poem, &quot;Wilfred Owen&#x27;s Photographs&quot;: &quot;A witty profound Irishman calls/For a &#x27;cat&#x27; into the House, and sits to watch/The gentry fingering its stained tails./Whereupon ...Quietly, unopposed,/The motion was passed.&quot;
In the Napoleonic Wars, the maximum number of lashes that could be inflicted on soldiers in the British Army reached 1,200. This many lashes could permanently disable or kill a man. Charles Oman, historian of the Peninsular War, noted that the maximum sentence was inflicted &quot;nine or ten times by general court-martial during the whole six years of the war&quot; and that 1,000 lashes were administered about 50 times. Other sentences were for 900, 700, 500 and 300 lashes. One soldier was sentenced to 700 lashes for stealing a beehive. Another man was let off after only 175 of 400 lashes, but spent three weeks in the hospital. Later in the war, the more draconian punishments were abandoned and the offenders shipped to New South Wales instead, where more whippings often awaited them. (See Australian penal colonies section.) Oman later wrote: 

The 3rd battalion&#x27;s Royal Anglian Regiment nickname of &quot;The Steelbacks&quot; is taken from one of its former regiments, the 48th (Northamptonshire) Regiment of Foot who earned the nickname for their stoicism when being flogged with the cat o&#x27; nine tails (&quot;Not a whimper under the lash&quot;), a routine method of administering punishment in the Army in the 18th and early 19th centuries.

Shortly after the establishment of Northern Ireland the Special Powers Act of 1922 (known as the &quot;Flogging Act&quot;) was enacted by the Parliament of Northern Ireland. The Act enabled the government to &#x27;take all such steps and issue all such orders as may be necessary for preserving the peace and maintaining order&#x27;. The long serving Home Affairs Minister Dawson Bates (1921–1943) was empowered to make any regulation felt necessary to preserve law and order. Breaking those regulations could bring a sentenced of up to a year in prison with hard labour, and in the case of some crimes, whipping. This act was in place until 1973, when it was replaced with the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973. An imprisoned member of the Irish Republican Army (1922–1969), Frank Morris remembered his 15 &quot;strokes of the cat&quot; in 1942: &quot;The pain was dreadful; you couldn&#x27;t imagine it. The tail-ends cut my flesh to the bone, but I was determined not to scream and I didn&#x27;t.&quot; 

The King&#x27;s German Legion (KGL), which were German units in British pay, did not flog. In one case, a British soldier on detached duty with the KGL was sentenced to be flogged, but the German commander refused to carry out the punishment. When the British 73rd Foot flogged a man in occupied France in 1814, disgusted French citizens protested against it.

====France====
During the French Revolutionary Wars the French Army stopped floggings altogether, inflicting death penalty or other severe corporal punishments instead.

=== Australian penal colonies ===

Once common in the British Army and British Royal Navy as a means of discipline, flagellation also featured prominently in the British penal colonies in early colonial Australia. Given that convicts in Australia were already &quot;imprisoned&quot;, punishments for offenses committed there could not usually result in imprisonment and thus usually consisted of corporal punishment such as hard labour or flagellation. Unlike Roman times, British law explicitly forbade the combination of corporal and capital punishment; thus, a convict was either flogged or hanged but never both.

Flagellation took place either with a single whip or, more notoriously, with the cat o&#x27; nine tails. Typically, the offender&#x27;s upper half was bared and he was suspended by the wrists beneath a tripod of wooden beams (known as &#x27;the triangle&#x27;). In many cases, the offender&#x27;s feet barely touched ground, which helped to stretch the skin taut and increase the damage inflicted by the whip. It also centered the offender&#x27;s weight in his shoulders, further ensuring a painful experience.

With the prisoner thus stripped and bound, either one or two floggers administered the prescribed number of strokes, or &quot;lashes,&quot; to the victim&#x27;s back. During the flogging, a doctor or other medical worker was consulted at regular intervals as to the condition of the prisoner. In many cases, however, the physician merely observed the offender to determine whether he was conscious. If the prisoner passed out, the physician would order a halt until the prisoner was revived, and then the whipping would continue.

Female convicts were also subject to flogging as punishment, both on the convict ships and in the penal colonies. Although they were generally given fewer lashes than males (usually limited to 40 in each flogging), there was no other difference between the manner in which males and females were flogged.

Floggings of both male and female convicts were public, administered before the whole colony&#x27;s company, assembled especially for the purpose. In addition to the infliction of pain, one of the principal purposes of the flogging was to humiliate the offender in front of his mates and to demonstrate, in a forceful way, that he had been required to submit to authority.

At the conclusion of the whipping, the prisoner&#x27;s lacerated back was normally rinsed with brine, which served as a crude and painful disinfectant.

Flogging still continued for years after independence. The last person flogged in Australia was William John O&#x27;Meally in 1958 in Melbourne&#x27;s Pentridge Prison.

==As a religious practice==


===Antiquity===
During the Ancient Roman festival of Lupercalia, young men ran through the streets with thongs cut from the hide of goats which had just been sacrificed, whipping people with the thongs as they ran. According to Plutarch, women would put themselves in their way to receive blows on the hands, believing that this would help them to conceive or grant them an easy delivery. The eunuch priests of the goddess Cybele, the &quot;galli&quot;, flogged themselves until they bled during the annual festival called Dies Sanguinis. The initiation ceremonies of Greco-Roman mystery religions also sometimes involved ritual flagellation, as did the Spartan cult of Artemis Orthia.

===Christianity===
&quot;The Flagellation&quot;, in a Christian context, refers to an episode in the Passion of Christ prior to Jesus&#x27; crucifixion. The practice of mortification of the flesh for religious purposes has been utilised by members of various Christian denominations since the time of the Great Schism in 1054. Nowadays the instrument of penance is called a discipline, a cattail whip usually made of knotted cords, which is flung over the shoulders repeatedly during private prayer.

In the 13th century, a group of Roman Catholics, known as the Flagellants, took self-mortification to an extreme, and would travel to towns and publicly beat and whip each other while preaching repentance. As these demonstrations by nature were quite morbid and disorderly, they were, during periods of time, suppressed by the authorities. They continued to reemerge at different times up until the 16th century. Flagellation was also practised during the Black Plague as a means to purify oneself of sin and thus prevent contracting the disease. Pope Clement VI is known to have permitted it for this purpose in 1348, but changed course, as he condemned the Flagellants as a cult the following year.

Martin Luther, the Protestant Reformer, regularly practiced self-flagellation as a means of mortification of the flesh before leaving the Roman Catholic Church. Likewise, the Congregationalist writer Sarah Osborn (1714–1796) also practiced self-flagellation in order &quot;to remind her of her continued sin, depravity, and vileness in the eyes of God&quot;. It became &quot;quite common&quot; for members of the Tractarian movement (see Oxford Movement, 1830s onwards) within the Anglican Communion to practice self-flagellation using the discipline. St. Thérèse of Lisieux, a late 19th-century French Discalced Carmelite nun considered in Catholicism to be a Doctor of the Church, is an influential example of a saint who questioned prevailing attitudes toward physical penance. Her view was that loving acceptance of the many sufferings of daily life was pleasing to God, and fostered loving relationships with other people, more than taking upon oneself extraneous sufferings through instruments of penance. As a Carmelite nun, Saint Thérèse practiced voluntary corporal mortification.

Some members of strict monastic orders, and some members of the Catholic lay organization Opus Dei, practice mild self-flagellation using the discipline. Pope John Paul II took the discipline regularly. Self-flagellation remains common in Colombia, the Philippines, Mexico, Spain and one convent in Peru.

===Shia Islam===

As suffering and cutting the body with knives or chains (&quot;matam&quot;) have been prohibited by Shi&#x27;a marjas like Ali Khamenei, Supreme Leader of Iran, some Shi&#x27;a observe mourning with blood donation which is called &quot;Qame Zani&quot; and flailing. Yet some Shi&#x27;ite men and boys continue to slash themselves with chains (&quot;zanjeer&quot;) or swords (talwar) and allow their blood to run freely.

Certain rituals like the traditional flagellation ritual called Talwar zani (&quot;talwar ka matam&quot; or sometimes &quot;tatbir&quot;) using a sword or &quot;zanjeer zani&quot; or &quot;zanjeer matam&quot;, involving the use of a &quot;zanjeer&quot; (a chain with blades) are also performed. These are religious customs that show solidarity with Husayn and his family. People mourn the fact that they were not present at the battle to fight and save Husayn and his family. In some western cities, Shi&#x27;a communities have organized blood donation drives with organizations like the Red Cross on Ashura as a positive replacement for self-flagellation rituals like &quot;Tatbir&quot; and &quot;Qame Zani&quot;.

==As a sexual practice==
Flagellation is also used as a sexual practice in the context of BDSM. The intensity of the beating is usually far less than used for punishment.

There are anecdotal reports of people willingly being bound or whipped, as a prelude to or substitute for sex, during the 14th century. Flagellation practiced within an erotic setting has been recorded from at least the 1590s evidenced by a John Davies epigram, and references to &quot;flogging schools&quot; in Thomas Shadwell&#x27;s &quot;The Virtuoso&quot; (1676) and Tim Tell-Troth&#x27;s &quot;Knavery of Astrology&quot; (1680). Visual evidence such as mezzotints and print media in the 1600s is also identified revealing scenes of flagellation, such as in the late seventeenth-century English mezzotint &quot;The Cully Flaug&#x27;d&quot; from the British Museum collection.

John Cleland&#x27;s novel &quot;Fanny Hill&quot;, published in 1749, incorporates a flagellation scene between the character&#x27;s protagonist Fanny Hill and Mr Barville. A large number of flagellation publications followed, including &quot;Fashionable Lectures: Composed and Delivered with Birch Discipline&quot; (c. 1761), promoting the names of ladies offering the service in a lecture room with rods and cat o&#x27; nine tails.

<text>Moffett Federal Airfield , also known as Moffett Field, is a joint civil-military airport located in an unincorporated part of Santa Clara County, California, United States, between northern Mountain View and northern Sunnyvale. On November 10, 2014, NASA announced that it would be leasing of the airfield property to Google for 60 years.

The airport is near the south end of San Francisco Bay, northwest of San Jose. Formerly a US Navy facility, the former naval air station is now owned and operated by the NASA Ames Research Center. Tenant military activities include the 129th Rescue Wing of the California Air National Guard, operating the HC-130J Combat King II and HH-60G Pave Hawk aircraft, as well as the adjacent Headquarters for the 7th Psychological Operations Group of the US Army Reserve. Until July 28, 2010, the US Air Force&#x27;s 21st Space Operations Squadron was also a tenant command at Moffett Field, occupying the former Onizuka Air Force Station. In addition to these military activities, NASA also operates several of its own aircraft from Moffett.

Hangars One, Two, and Three, and the adjacent Shenandoah Plaza are collectively designated as a National Historic District listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Hangar One is one of the world&#x27;s largest freestanding structures, covering . The hangar was constructed in 1931. Hangar One is a Naval Historical Monument, Historic American Engineering Record CA-335, State of California Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks. In May 2008, The National Trust for Historic Preservation listed Hangar One on their list of America&#x27;s Most Endangered Places.

Hangar Two is one of the world&#x27;s largest freestanding wood structures, as was Hangar Three before it was demolished in 2024. The hangars were constructed when the US Navy established ten lighter-than-air bases across the United States during World War II as part of the coastal defense plan. Five of the original seventeen of these wooden hangars still exist: one at Moffett Field, one at Tustin, California, one at Tillamook, Oregon, and two at Lakehurst, New Jersey.

The adjacent NASA Ames Research Center is also home to several wind tunnels, including the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel (a National Historic Landmark), and the National Full-Scale Aerodynamic Complex.

Occasionally, various jets from the United States Marine Corps will temporarily stay at the airfield before heading out to the numerous military operations areas nearby along the California coast.

==History==
===Sunnyvale operations===
In 1930, the city of Sunnyvale acquired a parcel of farmland bordering San Francisco Bay, paid for with nearly raised by the citizens of Santa Clara County, then &quot;sold&quot; the parcel for $1 to the US government as a home base for the Navy airship USS &quot;Macon&quot;. The location proved to be ideal for an airport, since the area is often clear while other parts of the San Francisco Bay are covered in fog. This is due to the Coast Range to the west, which blocks the cold oceanic air that is the cause of San Francisco fog.

===Naval operations===

The naval air station (NAS) was authorized by an Act of Congress, signed by President Herbert Hoover on 12 February 1931. Construction of the original facilities was begun 8 July 1931. The base was originally named Airbase Sunnyvale CAL as it was thought that calling it Mountain View would cause officials to fear airships colliding with mountainsides. The original station was commissioned on 12 April 1933 and dedicated NAS Sunnyvale. After the death of Rear Admiral William A. Moffett, who is credited with the creation of the airfield, in the loss of the USS &quot;Akron&quot; on 4 April 1933, the airfield at NAS Sunnyvale was renamed Moffett Field on 1 September 1933. In the tradition of the Navy, the installation is named for the surrounding city, while the airfield on the installation, including runways, can be named after an individual. Examples include Forrest Sherman Airfield at NAS Pensacola and Halsey Airfield at NAS North Island.

After the &quot;Macon&quot; crashed in the Pacific Ocean on 12 February 1935, the Navy considered closing NAS Sunnyvale and Moffett Field at due to its high cost of operations. Also, in San Diego, the Army and Navy were having jurisdictional issues over Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego harbor, which had both NAS San Diego as well as the Army&#x27;s Rockwell Field dividing the island. The Navy wanted the Army out of North Island as it needed to expand NAS San Diego as a training airfield for its growing number of aircraft carrier pilots. The Army resisted strongly, as Rockwell Field was a major training airfield for flight cadets, and had been using the field for flight training since 1912. With the subtle assistance of President Franklin Roosevelt, a former assistant secretary of the Navy, a complex arrangement of facilities realignment was made by the War Department which transferred NAS Sunnyvale and Moffett Field to Army jurisdiction and Rockwell Field to the Navy in October 1935, becoming NAS North Island.

Upon taking jurisdiction of NAS Sunnyvale and Moffett Field, the base was renamed Army Air Corps Training Base Sunnyvale. The Army also took on the high cost of Hangar One&#x27;s maintenance and wanted to inactivate the facility. However, President Roosevelt would not allow the closure of the facility, and the Army assigned Moffett to its Western Flying Training Command as headquarters for pilot and aircrew flight training west of the Rocky Mountains. Also in 1939, the former NAS Sunnyvale saw the establishment of the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory.

As an aftermath of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Navy wanted to use Moffett Field and the large dirigible hangar for blimp operations along with Pacific Coast. However, the Army, still stinging about having to transfer Rockwell Field to the Navy, resisted strongly. Again the inter-service rivalry was overruled by the War Department, citing the Navy&#x27;s need for coastal defense a priority and ordered the Army to move its training headquarters to Hamilton Field in Marin County, north of San Francisco.

On April 16, 1942, control of the facility was returned to the Navy and it was recommissioned as NAS Sunnyvale. Four days later it was again renamed Naval Air Station Moffett Field, thereby becoming one of the few Naval Air Stations named after an individual. The Navy then built Hangars 2 and 3 on the eastern side of the runways for additional blimp operations. Due to the priority of metal for use in building war materials such as airplanes, ships and tanks, these two hangars were built from wood and concrete. From the end of World War II until its closure, NAS Moffett Field saw the development and use of several generations of land-based anti-submarine warfare and maritime patrol aircraft, including the Lockheed P2V Neptune and Lockheed P-3 Orion. Until the demise of the USSR and for some time thereafter, daily anti-submarine, maritime reconnaissance, Fleet support, and various training sorties flew out from NAS Moffett Field to patrol along the Pacific coastline, while Moffett&#x27;s other squadrons and aircraft periodically deployed to other Pacific, Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf bases for periods of up to six months.

The onset of the Korean War brought a restructuring of the Navy&#x27;s disposition of air forces, resulting in several squadrons being transferred to the Moffett Field as well as Naval Air Station Alameda. During the 1950s the Moffett served as the fighter base, with Alameda hosting attack aircraft. Naval aircraft home based in Moffett included the F9F Panther and FJ-3 Fury. On Feb. 1, 1957, a Navy Thunderjet plane piloted by Capt. Robert Mulvehill, 32, of Edenburg, PA, crashed at 3:25 p.m. in Mountain View while on approach to Moffett Field. The plane was travelling parallel to Castro Street when it crashed near the corner of California and Oak Streets, narrowly missing an elementary school, according to the Mountain View Register-Leader—the local paper of record at the time.

By the end of the 1950s the Navy was looking to consolidate assets as the majority of carrier based aircraft had transitioned to larger jet powered aircraft, needing longer runways. The majority of squadrons based at Moffett transferred to Naval Air Station Miramar when they transitioned to the F-8 Crusader; while attack aircraft from Alameda were relocated to the newly opened Naval Air Station Lemoore. By 1961, the last fighter aircraft had left Moffett Field.

In 1960, the nearby Air Force Satellite Test Center (STC), was created adjacent to (on the SE corner of) NAS Moffett Field. Often referred to as &quot;the Blue Cube,&quot; it was operational until 2010 as Onizuka Air Force Station, part of the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN). The building was demolished in 2014.

In August 1986 during the &quot;NAS Moffett Field Airshow&quot;, the Italian demonstration team, Frecce Tricolori, and the German Navy&#x27;s F-104 flight demonstration team, the Vikings, performed in front of the crowd.

At its peak in the 1990s, NAS Moffett Field was the U.S. Navy&#x27;s principal Pacific Fleet base for the P-3C operations. In addition to headquarters staffs for Commander, U.S. Patrol Wings Pacific Fleet (COMPATWINGSPAC); Commander, Patrol Wing 10 (COMPATWING 10); and Commander, Reserve Patrol Wing Pacific / Patrol Wing 4 (COMRESPATWINGPAC/COMPATWING 4), the air station also hosted Patrol Squadron THIRTY-ONE (VP-31)...the west coast P-3C Fleet Replacement Squadron, six additional active duty P-3C squadrons and a Naval Air Reserve P-3C squadron in addition to NASA and California Air National Guard aviation activities.

===Ames Research Center operations===
Post-Cold War defense cutbacks and related Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) actions in the 1990s identified NAS Moffett Field for closure. The west coast Fleet Replacement Squadron, Patrol Squadron 31 (VP-31), was deactivated and its functions combined with its east coast counterpart, Patrol Squadron 30 (VP-30) at NAS Jacksonville, Florida. Several active duty P-3C squadrons, the Naval Air Reserve P-3C squadron and COMRESPATWINGPAC/COMPATWING 4 were also deactivated, while COMPATWINGSPAC and COMPATWING 10 (redesignated COMPATRECONWING 10) transferred to NAS Whidbey Island, Washington and the remaining patrol squadrons transferred to NAS Whidbey Island, Washington or NAS Barbers Point, Hawaii until the latter&#x27;s BRAC-directed closure in 1999, at which time the Barbers Point squadrons moved to Marine Corps Air Facility Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii.

On 1 July 1994, NAS Moffett Field was closed as a naval air station and turned over to the NASA Ames Research Center. NASA Ames now operates the facility as Moffett Federal Airfield. Since being decommissioned as a primary military installation, part of Moffett has been made accessible to the public, including a cordoned portion of the interior of the massive Hangar One. There were once balloon rides given on show days, and micro-weather still occurs in the cavernous space.

Moffett Federal Airfield has occasional air traffic, with an average of 5-10 flights landing per day. Moffett is regularly used by the California Air National Guard, NASA, Lockheed Martin Space Systems (commercial satellite manufacturer), the Google founders for their private planes, the Santa Clara County Sheriff&#x27;s Department for their helicopter STAR 1, and Air Force One during presidential visits to the Bay Area.

In 2008, the Ames Research Center leased 42 acres around the field to Google. In 2013 Google began building a 1.1 million square foot office complex consisting of nine buildings overlooking San Francisco Bay dubbed &quot;Bay View.&quot; The buildings are to be the new headquarters for Google and will be part of the nearby Googleplex.

== Hangar One ==

Moffett Field&#x27;s &quot;Hangar One&quot; (built during the Depression era for the USS &quot;Macon&quot;) and the row of World War II blimp hangars are still some of the largest unsupported structures in the country. The airship hangar is constructed on a network of steel girders sheathed with galvanized steel. It rests firmly upon a reinforced pad anchored to concrete pilings. The floor covers ) and can accommodate six (360 feet x 160 feet) football fields. The airship hangar itself, measures long and wide. The building has aerodynamic architecture. Its walls curve upward and inward, to form an elongated dome high. The clam-shell doors were designed to reduce turbulence when the &quot;Macon&quot; moved in and out on windy days. The &quot;orange peel&quot; doors, weighing 500 tons (511.88 tonnes) each, are moved by their own 150 horsepower motors operated via an electrical control panel.

The airship hangar&#x27;s interior is so large that fog sometimes forms near the ceiling. A person unaccustomed to its vastness is susceptible to optical disorientation. Looking across its deck, planes and tractors look like toys. Along its length maintenance shops, inspection laboratories and offices help keep the hangar busy. Looking up, a network of catwalks for access to all parts of the structure can be seen. Two elevators meet near the top, allowing maintenance personnel to get to the top quickly and easily.

Narrow gauge tracks run through the length of the hangar. During the period of lighter-than-air dirigibles and non-rigid aircraft, the rails extended across the apron and into the fields at each end of the hangar. This tramway facilitated the transportation of an airship on the mooring mast to the airship hangar interior or to the flight position. During the brief period that the &quot;Macon&quot; was based at Moffett, Hangar One accommodated not only the giant airship but several smaller, non-rigid blimps simultaneously.

In 2003, plans to convert Hangar One to a space and science center were put on hold with the discovery that the structure was leaking toxic chemicals into the sediment in wetlands bordering San Francisco Bay. The chemicals originated in the lead paint and toxic materials, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), used to coat the hangar. Options under debate included tearing down the hangar and reusing the land, and cleaning the toxic waste from the site and refurbishing the hangar for future preservation.

The US Navy evaluated options for remediating the PCBs, lead and asbestos, and NASA evaluated options for reuse of the hangar. Some historic and nonprofit groups wanted the hangar preserved as a historic landmark, as the hangar is a major Bay Area landmark and historic site.

In 2006, an offer to clean the hangar and coat its outsides with solar panels to recoup the costs of cleaning was floated by a private company, but the plan never saw fruition because it was too costly.

In August 2008, the Navy proposed simply stripping the toxic coating from the hangar and leaving the skeleton after spraying it with a preservative. The Navy claimed that to reclad the structure would cost another $15 million and that this was NASA&#x27;s responsibility. This was regarded as a partial victory by campaigners.

In September 2008, NASA indicated that it was still urging the Navy to restore the hangar, but that it was willing to help save the structure; in particular, NASA was in favor of re-covering the structure at the same time that it was stripped.

 In April 2011, the exterior panels began coming down, starting at the top.

===Restoration===
On April 21, 2011, crews began stripping the PCB-laced exterior panels of Hangar One.

In November 2014, Planetary Ventures LLC, a Google subsidiary, signed a $1.16 billion, 60-year lease. 
This would &quot;save NASA approximately $6.3 million annually in maintenance and operation costs&quot;. Google planned to invest an additional $200 million to renovate and restore the structure.

==Hangars 2 &amp; 3==
Moffett Field&#x27;s Hangars Two and Three were built at the beginning of World War II for a program of coastal defense. The Hangars are still some of the largest unsupported wooden structures in the country.

In 1940, the US Navy proposed to the US Congress the development of a lighter-than-air station program for anti-submarine patrolling of the coast and harbors. This program proposed the construction of new stations in addition to the expansion at NAS Lakehurst. The original contract was for steel hangars, long, wide and , helium storage and service, barracks for 228 men, a power plant, landing mat, and a mobile mooring mast. The Second Deficiency Appropriation Bill for 1941, passed July 3, 1941, changed the authorization to the construction of 8 facilities to accommodate a total of 48 airships (as requested in 1940), but due to steel rations, a total of 17 large wooden hangars were built among 10 LTA bases.

As finally developed in 1943, LTA facilities in addition to NAS Lakehurst (2) and NAS Moffett Field (2), included NAS South Weymouth (1), NAS Weeksville (1), NAS Glynco (2), NAS Richmond (3), NAS Houma (1), NAS Hitchcock (1), NAS Santa Ana (2) and NAS Tillamook (2). In the initial program, accommodations were provided for six airships at each station. This was later increased to twelve at seven of the stations and to eighteen at NAS Richmond as a result of an increase in the authorized strength to 200 airships.

An episode of the Discovery Channel TV show &quot;MythBusters&quot; used one of the hangars to disprove the myth that it is not possible to fold a sheet of paper in half more than seven times. The sheet of paper covered nearly the full width of the airship hangar. Other &quot;Mythbusters&quot; episodes have utilized the hangar to test myths such as &quot;Inflating a football with helium allows longer kick distances&quot; and &quot;Airworthy aircraft can be constructed of concrete.&quot;

Hangar 3 was demolished in stages beginning in Summer 2024, after NASA and Google concluded it would be &quot;cost-prohibitive&quot; to repair.

Five of the original 17 of the wooden hangars still exist: Moffett Field (1), Tustin, California (1), Tillamook, Oregon (1), and Lakehurst, New Jersey (2).

==Facilities==
Despite its closure as an active military base, Moffett Field still has many active facilities and residents. Active military families still live on Moffett Community Housing, and the former base has several lodges which primarily house academics and students associated with the Ames Research Center. Moffett Field&#x27;s facilities available to residents include a Commissary, post office, golf course, and tennis courts.

===Status of former military buildings===
Many of the buildings at Moffett Field which once supported its active military presence have been abandoned and left standing due to asbestos contamination within the structures .

===Airfield===
Moffett Field is an active airfield, and has two active runways:

*Runway 14L/32R: , surface: concrete
*Runway 14R/32L: , surface: asphalt

===University facilities===
Moffett Field currently hosts Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley and will be the site of Berkeley Space Center, a new campus of UC Berkeley. These are within the base primarily to support the academic and research collaboration between these institutions and NASA Ames.

===Private aircraft===
Moffett Airfield is home to H211, LLC, owned by Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Through the LLC they pay $1.3 million a year to NASA to park their Boeing 767-200 and Gulfstream V jets. The airplanes have also had scientific equipment installed by NASA to allow experiments to be run in flight.

Lockheed Martin and Jon Stark, a helicopter operator, also have use of the airfield.

In October 2008 the first Zeppelin airship to offer private flights in the United States since 1937&#x27;s Hindenburg disaster became available for tours of the Bay Area and beyond. The craft, operated by Airship Ventures, was housed in Hangar Two, was built in Germany and was the fourth modern airship constructed and the third to be put in public service. It was dedicated and given the name &quot;Eureka&quot; at the celebration of Moffett Field&#x27;s 75th anniversary. Zeppelin flights ended in November 2012, and Airship Ventures ceased business. &quot;Eureka&quot; was disassembled and returned to Germany.

Strong community opposition to the use of the airfield by FedEx Express and UPS Airlines blocked the transition of the airfield to public use in the 1990s.

AirNav.com reports that &quot;Moffett Field is now available to corporate and charter aircraft (jet fuel only)&quot;, with prior permission required for landing. Google subsidiary Planetary Ventures has retained contractor Avports LLC to manage the facilities and provide services as a fixed-base operator (FBO).

===United States Geological Survey (USGS)===
In 2016, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) announced plans to relocate its West Coast science center from nearby Menlo Park to the Ames Research Center at Moffett Field. The relocation formally began with a ribbon-cutting event in July 2019. As of April 2024 the project was described as &quot;wrapping up&quot;, with &quot;full relocation ... scheduled by the end of the year.&quot;

==Motor racing==
On August 16, 1953, the airfield was used for a meeting organised by the Sports Car Club of America. A 5.6 km circuit was created using one of the main runways and adjacent taxiways.

==Accidents and incidents at or near NUQ==
*On February 1, 1953, a Republic F-84 Thunderjet burst into flames on final approach. The plane hit the ground near downtown Mountain View, damaging three homes and six cars. The pilot was killed and one person on the ground sustained minor injuries.
*On April 11, 1968, a Royal Australian Air Force Lockheed P-3C Orion burst into flames when the undercarriage collapsed on landing during pre-delivery acceptance trials. There were no fatalities.
*On May 26, 1972, a United States Navy Lockheed P-3C Orion went missing during a routine training flight off the coast of California. All eight crew were presumed dead.
*On April 12, 1973, a NASA Convair CV-990 Coronado, testing survey equipment over Monterey Bay, and a US Navy Lockheed P-3C Orion, practicing touch-and-go landings, collided on final approach. Both aircraft crashed onto Sunnyvale Municipal Golf Course, half a mile short of the runway. All 11 occupants on the Convair 990 Coronado and five of the six crew on board the Lockheed P-3C were killed in the accident. A total of 16 perished on both aircraft with one survivor.
*On March 21, 1991, two P-3C Orion aircraft from the NAS Moffett Field based VP-50 Blue Dragons had a mid-air collision while on a training mission off the coast of southern California in preparation for deployment to NAS Adak Alaska. All 23 crew members on board the 2 aircraft were killed in the accident. The Chief of Naval Operations was present for the memorial service held at NAS Moffett Field for those crew members.

<text>Anton Peterlin () (25 September 1908 – 24 March 1993) was a Slovenian physicist.

==Life and career==
Peterlin was born in Ljubljana, Slovenia. After receiving his D. Sc. in physics from Humboldt University of Berlin in Berlin, Germany in 1938, Peterlin accepted in 1939 the chair as a professor of physics at the University of Ljubljana, where he remained for 22 years. Besides his pedagogical duties, he accepted in 1947 the position of the founding director of the Jožef Stefan Institute in Ljubljana. In 1960, Peterlin left his home country. In order to be able to continue his theoretical research on macromolecules he accepted the position of a full professor and head of the Institute of Physics at the Technical University of Munich, Germany. Only a year later he relocated to North Carolina where he was entrusted with the directorship of the newly founded Camille Dreyfus Laboratory at the Research Triangle Institute, which was almost entirely devoted to basic research on polymers. He also served as adjunct professor at Duke University. Upon his mandatory retirement in 1973 at age 65, Peterlin left for Washington, DC to become a senior scientist at the National Bureau of Standards, now National Institute of Science and Technology, a post he held until 1984.

==Recognition and legacy==
Anton Peterlin was an internationally acclaimed scientist, the author of nearly 400 scholarly publications. For his research he received the Prešeren Award (Slovenian highest scientific award) in 1955. He was awarded the Bingham Medal for rheology in 1970 and the American Physical Society&#x27;s High Polymer Physics Prize for 1972. A specialist in polymers, Peterlin was a member of numerous scientific societies, including the American Physical Society, the Deutsche Kolloid Gesellschaft, the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft, and the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. His son Boris Matija Peterlin is a distinguished biomedical researcher at the University of California, San Francisco. His grandson and namesake Anton Peterlin is an American soccer player.

Anton Peterlin died in Ljubljana.

<text>Until 1 January 2007 Galten municipality was a municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) in Aarhus County in the eastern part of the Jutland peninsula in central Denmark. The municipality covered an area of 72.73 km2, and had a total population of 11,086 (2005). Its last mayor was Jens Grønlund, a member of the Venstre (Liberal Party) political party. The site of its municipal council was the town of Galten.

The municipality was created in 1970 as the result of a (&quot;Municipality Reform&quot;) that combined the following parishes: Galten, Sjelle, Skivholme, Skovby, Skørring, Stjær, and Storring parishes.

Galten municipality ceased to exist as the result of &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007). It was merged with existing Hørning, Ry, and Skanderborg municipalities to form the new Skanderborg municipality. This created a municipality with an area of 416 km2 and a total population of 49,469 (2005) in Region Midtjylland.

<text>Hadsten (locally ) is a railway town in central Denmark with a population of 8,448 (1 January 2024), and the second largest town in Favrskov Municipality after Hinnerup, located in Region Midtjylland in Central Jutland. Until 1 January 2007 it was the site of the municipal council of the now former Hadsten municipality. Other names for Hadsten are: Hadsten Stationsby.

Hadsten has many educational institutions, including a technical school, gymnasium (Secondary school), and folk high school. Hadsten is famous for having one of the largest model railways in Europe. Besides that, Hadsten has the shortest pedestrian street in Europe.

In Denmark, pronunciation of the town&#x27;s name has often been the subject of confusion, as locals pronounce the name with a silent &quot;d&quot;; as &quot;Ha&#x27;sten&quot;.

==Etymology==
Hadsten was mentioned in text for the first time in 1432 as &quot;Halstiern&quot;, which seems like it comes from the old Danish word &quot;tjærn&quot;, meaning &#x27;little lake&#x27;. The river in Hadsten, Lilleåen, did at the time form a little lake at Kollerup Gods.

When the train station was built, the town of Vinterslev was actually larger, but since the Post Office believe it would cause confusion with the town Vinderslev in Silkeborg Municipality, Hadsten Stationsby was chosen instead.

== History ==

Archaeological excavations around the town have shown that people have lived in Lilleådalen as far back as 2,000 BC in the Nordic Stone Age. The excavation at the water mill, which later became known as Hadsten Mølle, have revealed the remains of an even older water mill from around the 1190&#x27;s in the early High Middle Ages. The present mill originates from the 1400s during the Clausholm Castle era, and later gained its present name of Hadsten Mølle.

Hadsten was mentioned for the first time in 1432 as Halstiern suggesting to come from the Old Norse word &quot;tjærn&quot; which means &quot;little lake&quot;, while the neck also in Old Danish refers to the narrowing the small river valley have of Kollerup Gods. The water level this river at that time has stood 2–3 meters higher than it is today - which is why the valley was marked by lakes.

The modern town was founded on 3 September 1862, when &quot;Den østjyske længdebane&quot; (The Eastern Jutland Railway) opened. In 2012, the town celebrated its 150th anniversary, with a visit by Frederik, the Crown Prince of Denmark and his wife, Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark. The town was at the plant of the East Jutland stretch of railway line, which was officially inaugurated on 3 September 1862. Therefore, this date is seen as the town&#x27;s founding. In September 2012 celebrated its 150th anniversary with the visit of Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary.

One of the most advanced buildings in Denmark is in Hadsten; it functions as a café, library and auditorium.

<text>Hinnerup is a small town in eastern Jutland, Denmark, in Favrskov Municipality, Region Midtjylland, northwest of Aarhus. It has become mostly a suburb, and is connected to Aarhus by Søften, Lisbjerg and Skejby. The town has a population of 8,464 (1 January 2024). 

Until 1 January 2007, Hinnerup was the site of the municipal council of the now former Hinnerup Municipality. It is now the municipal seat of Favrskov Municipality.

== History ==
The railway town of &quot;Hinnerup Stationsby&quot; emerged in 1862. The town later gave its name to the former Hinnerup Municipality, which was formed in 1967 by fusing the parishes of Grundfør, Vitten, Haldum and Vitten with Søften-Foldby Municipality.

A central building is &quot;Hinnerup Bibliotek og Kulturhus&quot; (Library and Cultural House), which opened in May 1993. The modern building has been designed by Hans Peter Svendler Nielsen from architectural firm 3XN, in Aarhus. In April 2002, an arson ruined most of the library facilities; however, it was re-opened in November the same year. The building also houses small art exhibitions and serves as a tiny ticket sales office for the railway line going right by.

In 2012, the city celebrated its 150th anniversary with a visit by Frederik, the Crown Prince of Denmark and his wife, Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark.

<doc id="144262" wikidata="Q2604983" url="?curid=144262" title="Hammel">
<text>Hammel is a town in central Denmark with a population of 7,215 (1 January 2024), and a former railway town at the Aarhus-Hammel-Thorsø railroad which was closed in 1956. The town is located in Favrskov municipality in Jutland. Until 1 January 2007 it was also the site of the municipal council of the now former Hammel Municipality.

== History ==
Hammel first saw significant settlement in the 13th century. The town was recorded as &quot;Hamel&quot; in 1479 and &quot;Hammell&quot; in 1596. The etymology of the town&#x27;s name is believed to derive from the old Danish term &quot;hamal&quot;, meaning &quot;hill&quot;.

Hammel was not significantly larger than the other settlements in the area until the 1860s. In the first half of the 19th century, the village had about 11 farms and 40 houses which belonged to the count of Frijsenborg. Its expansion was the result of several initiatives taken by the count, who sought to transform the village into a market-town. Through his influence, the local court building for the judicial district of Frijsenborg-Favrskov was established in the town in 1837. By 1900, a prison, pharmacy, hotel, post office, technical school, primary school, hospital school and industrial factories had opened in the town.

By 1902, the town had a population of over 1,200. That year, Hammel station was designed by architect Heinrich Wenck and opened as the terminus of the Hammel-Aarhus Railway. The rail line was extended in 1914 to Thorsø, though the number of passengers traveling from Thorsø to Hammel was never profitable. Nevertheless, the railway connection in Hammel turned it into a railway town, and its population expanded. By 1916 Hammel had a population of 1,513, and by 1955 had 2,282. The entire railway line closed in 1956 and parts have since been preserved as a walking path. Wenck&#x27;s original station building still stands at Torvegade 9.

For much of its history, Hammel was a parish within the jurisdiction of Gjern Herred. Following the 1970 Danish Municipal Reform the town beceame the seat of Hammel Municipality. The municipality was dissolved in the municipal reform of 2007, and today Hammel lies with Favrskov Municipality.

== Religion ==

Hammel Church was originally constructed in the romanesque style c. 1100. Its nave and part of the choir date to the 12th century, while the tower was added in the 17th and altered in the 19th century. In 1558, the king ordered that the nearby Jernit Church be demolished and its possessions be transferred to Hammel, thus expanding the size of Hammel&#x27;s parish. Today, the church is considered a road church.

== Notable people ==
* Dr. Timen Stiddem (born 1610 in Hammel), a prominent citizen and doctor in Wilmington, Delaware, arrived in New Sweden in 1654 and is recorded as the first physician in Delaware
* Johan Bartholdy (1853 in Hammel–1904), an organist, composer, singing teacher, conductor and author
* Chris Anker Sørensen (born 1984 in Hammel–2021), a Danish professional road bicycle racer
* Gitte Sunesen (born 1971 in Hammel), a former handball player and gold medallist at the 1996 Summer Olympics

<text>Hørning is a town in central Denmark with a population of 8,462 (1 January 2024), located in Skanderborg Municipality on the peninsula of Jutland. Today Hørning is a southwestern suburb of Aarhus located between Aarhus and Skanderborg.

Hørning should not be mistaken for Herning which is the bigger, more metropolitan city in Jutland where the regional train passing through Hørning is also destined to.

==Etymology==
Hørning got its name from a bend in the main road that runs through the town. In Danish, a bend can be loosely translated to &quot;Hjørne&quot; (Corner), and &quot;ing&quot; (People) is a typical ending for city names in Denmark, dating the name to the Middle Ages. Over the years the &quot;j&quot; disappeared, and thus the name became Hørning. The bend in the main road is close by &quot;Hørning Kro&quot;, the town inn. On the other side of the bend, you&#x27;ll find the old rider school, which was a commoners&#x27; school built by King Frederick IV.

<text>Until 1 January 2007 Midtdjurs (&quot;Central Djursland&quot;) was a municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) in the former Aarhus County on the Jutland peninsula in central Denmark. The municipality, in the middle of a region known as &quot;Djursland&quot;, covered an area of 179 km2, and had a total population of 7.763 (2005). Its last mayor was Kim Dalgaard Poulsen, a member of the Venstre (Liberal Party) political party. The main town and the site of its municipal council was the town of Kolind.

The municipality was created in 1970 due to a (&quot;Municipality Reform&quot;) that combined a number of existing parishes: Ebdrup, Koed, Koling, Marie Magdalene, Nimtofte, Nødager, Skarresø, and Tøstrup parishes.

Midtdjurs municipality ceased to exist as the result of &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007). It was merged with existing Ebeltoft, Rosenholm, and Rønde municipalities to form the new Syddjurs municipality. This created a municipality with an area of 693 km2 and a total population of 40,196 (2005). The new municipality belongs to Region Midtjylland (&quot;Mid-Jutland Region&quot;).

<text>Odder is a town in Jutland, Denmark. The town is the seat of Odder municipality, and is the biggest town in the municipality. It is located 20 km south of Aarhus and 16 km south-east of Skanderborg.

Odder is part of Business Region Aarhus, and the East Jutland metropolitan area, and is served by the Odder Line since 1884 before the line was rebuilt to be part of the Aarhus Letbane in 2016-2018.

== History ==

Odder is first mentioned in 1363 as &quot;Oddræth&quot;. The town was built up around Odder River (Danish: &quot;Odder Å&quot;), which cross through the town. By 1850, the town had grown to the population of about 900 people, and was granted a license to hold a market twice a year. Around the same time, an unsuccessful application was made to dig a canal to the north-east coast.

Odder became a railway town in 1884 when Hads-Ning Herreders Jernbane railway line was established, connecting the city to Hou and Aarhus. In 2018, the railway stretch became a light rail stretch in the Aarhus light rail.

==Arts and culture==
===Odder Museum===

Odder Museum is located centrally in Odder, next to Odder Water- and Steam Mill (Danish: &quot;Odder Vand- og Dampmølle&quot;), which is part of the museum. The museum was founded in 1928, and has 400 m2 of exhibitions, mainly focussed on local history. The mill is from 1883 and stands as it did when production stopped in 1955.

==Transport==
===Rail===

The Odder railway line connects Odder with Aarhus and the rest of the Danish rail network. Odder railway station is the principal station of the town, and offers direct local train services to Aarhus and as part of the Aarhus Light Rail system. The northern part of the town is also served by the railway halt Rude Havvej.

== Sports ==

*RK Tacklers (2002)

==Churches==
There are 2 lutheran churches in the town of Odder. One is part of the Church of Denmark and the other is an independent church following Grundtvigtianism.

===Parish Church===
Odder Parish Church (Danish: &quot;Odder Sognekirke&quot;) is located near the pedestrian street in the town, bordering Odder River to the north. It was built in the later half of the 1100s. The altarpiece is from 1640 and made by Peder Jensen Kolding. It portrays the Last Supper and in front of the two pillars are figures of the evangelists of Luke and John. Models of Matthew and Mark sit on top of the altarpiece. On top of the altarpiece is also a model of the Crucifixion of Jesus. The church&#x27;s pulpit is from 1590 to 1600 and the sounding board from 1703. The two church bells are from 1847 and 1854 respectively, and both from Copenhagen. The church once had a turret clock from 1656, but when the clock was unable to be repaired in 1856, the clock was removed and despite the church&#x27;s desire for a new, a new clock was never acquired.

===Grundtvigtianist Independent Church===
Odder Grundtvigtianist Independent Church (Danish: &quot;Odder Grundtvigske Valgmenighedskirke&quot;) is located east of Odder Parish Church, also near the center of the town. It is a church, independent from the Church of Denmark, though largely with the same beliefs. The congregation was founded in 1884 and the church built in 1885 and opened in 1886. The drawings for the church were made by Christen Jensen. The altarpiece displays a young Jesus, and is made by Troels Trier. The organ is from 1899, made by Frederik Nielsen from Aarhus.

<text>In Finland a &#x27; (Finnish for registered association) or &#x27; (Swedish) is a registered, non-profit organization. The abbreviations &#x27; (also &#x27;) (Finnish), &#x27; (Swedish) or &#x27; (Northern Sámi) are used as a suffix ending of the association&#x27;s name, added when the association is officially registered. Registration is not mandatory, but is required in order for the association to become a juridical person, which confers various benefits. Registration requires the association to create a legally sound constitution, which must be approved by the .

Said constitution must contain provisions outlining the association&#x27;s policies regarding language, its home address, its intended purpose and forms of activity, membership fees, its government board, accounting and bookkeeping, revision of the constitution, assembly meetings and how the association&#x27;s property is to be utilised in the event of its dissolution. Registered associations can have both individual persons and legal persons as its members. The association must have a government board consisting of at least three members, out of whom the speaker must be at the age of majority (18 years), the rest at least 15 years old. In principle, if the constitution provides for it, every member who is at least 15 years of age has one vote during board meetings, board elections and other votes.

When an association is officially registered, it becomes a juridical person with legal personality separate from those of its individual members and gains the right to own property and make contracts on its own behalf independently of its members, and it ensures the legal enforceability of its constitution. At the same time, the individual members no longer personally hold responsibility for the association&#x27;s liabilities.

In 2021, Finland had around 108,000 registered associations, down from 130,000 in 2011.

<doc id="144275" wikidata="Q1993774" url="?curid=144275" title="Rønde">
<text>Rønde (or Roende) is a town on the southern part of the peninsula, Djursland in Denmark, Northern Europe, 23 kilometers north-east of the north end of Denmark&#x27;s second largest city, Aarhus. It is in part a commuter town to Aarhus, with a motorway entering Aarhus from the north. Rønde is located between Aarhus, and Aarhus Airport with a 12 kilometer drive from Rønde to the airport.

Rønde is placed in hilly country overlooking Aarhus Bay with 2.5 kilometers to the bay and the marina, Nappedam. The closest sandy beach for swimming lies in Følle Strand, 3.4 kilometers from Rønde.

Rønde has a population of 3,310 as of 1. January 2024.

Rønde lies in Syddjurs Municipality. The administrative headquarters of Syddjurs Municipality is in Ebeltoft.

== Geography ==

Rønde is a hill town, with a 95-meter difference in elevation between the lowest and highest part. This kind of grade difference is unusual for Denmark, where the overall highest point in the country is 172 meters above sea level.

Rønde has a temperate coastal climate with an average summer temperature in July of 20 degrees Celsius in the day, and 12 degrees at night, and an average winter temperature in January with 5 degrees in the day and 1 degree at night (1961–1990) The average precipitation is 722 millimeters per year, making relatively flat Denmark well suited for farming. Barley, wheat, canola, and in recent years corn, are common crops in the farmland surrounding Rønde as well as in the rest of Denmark.

== Education ==
There is a public and a private primary school in Rønde, as well as Syddjurs Gymnasium, a high school with boarding. Rønde also has a vocational school with a number of lines related to crafts, commerce and computer oriented specialisations.

Rønde also has a Folk High School and an Efterskole. These are types of boarding schools that young people in Denmark can choose, typically for a year, to cultivate special interests such as sports and aspects of culture, such as theatre, or as a means of strengthening their academic skill, often as a break before continuing in the mainstream education system.

A neighboring smaller town, Ugelbølle, has a recently established private primary school, Ugelbølle Friskole. Ugelbølle also has an industrial area, and a newer residential neighborhood dominated by over the average priced housing. All of the houses have a view over Aarhus Bay. Ugelbølle lies 1.5 kilometres from the western outskirts of Rønde. The two towns are likely to merge in the coming years.

Another private primary school close to Rønde is Syddjurs Friskole 5.8 kilometres from Rønde.

Aarhus University has a bioscience department at the Kalø Estate just east of Rønde.

== Commerce ==
The main road through Rønde is also a route from the city of Aarhus to residential and summer house areas on the southern part of the Djursland peninsula. Rønde is also a local shopping centre. There are a number of shops, supermarkets, trades, crafts and restaurants in the town.

== Surroundings == 
At the southern outskirts of Rønde the recreational wood, Hestehave Wood, extends downhill to the sea at Aarhus Bay. The wood is state owned and has a network of footpaths and gravel roads used by the inhabitants of Rønde and others.
Next to Hestehave Wood lies the Kalø Castle Ruin 2.5 kilometres from Rønde, placed on an island with a cobbled medieval road on a dam leading to the ruin. The place is a tourist attraction.
Rønde lies next to the coastal Mols Bjerge National Park, covering a hilly area by the sea with many bays and coves. One of the two main roads to the tourism based coastal town, Ebeltoft in the park, passes through Rønde. Ebeltoft is 20 kilometers from Rønde to the south-east located on the southern part of the Djursland peninsula.

A road from Aarhus to another coastal town, Grenå, passes through Rønde, with 33 kilometres to Grenå. Grenå is a coastal town with part of the economy based on tourism, for a large part due to a sandy beach facing the Kattegat sea between Denmark and Sweden. Grenå is also a seaport with a ferry connection to Varberg in Sweden, as well as being a town based on industry and education.

There are many summer rentals and summer houses on the coastlines of the Djursland peninsula, including at the village, Følle Strand, 3.4 kilometres from Rønde.

== Transport ==

From Rønde one can travel to the island of Zealand and Copenhagen, via car and ferry sailing either from Ebeltoft or Aarhus, reaching the capital in approximately two and a half hours. It is also possible to drive all the way via bridges over the island of Fyn, to Zealand. This is a three and a half hour drive.

Public transportation in Denmark is often comprehensive. Rønde has a recently built a bus terminal. The town is a bus-hub for southern Djursland, including regular connections to Aarhus.
