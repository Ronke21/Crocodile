<text>Fairchild Air Force Base (AFB) is a United States Air Force base, located in the northwest United States in eastern Washington, approximately southwest of Spokane.

The host unit at Fairchild is the 92nd Air Refueling Wing (92 ARW) assigned to the Air Mobility Command&#x27;s Eighteenth Air Force. The 92 ARW is responsible for providing air refueling, as well as passenger and cargo airlift and aero-medical evacuation missions supporting U.S. and coalition conventional operations as well as U.S. Strategic Command strategic deterrence missions.

Fairchild AFB was established in 1942 as the Spokane Army Air Depot. and is named in honor of General Muir S. Fairchild a World War I aviator from the state, he was the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force at the time of his death.

During the Cold War, Fairchild was a Strategic Air Command (SAC) base for 45 years (1947–1992), with bombers and tankers, as well as missiles for a brief period (1960–1965).

, the 92d Air Refueling Wing was commanded by Colonel Derek Salmi. Its Command Chief Master Sergeant was Chief Master Sergeant Lee Mills.
==History==

Fairchild Air Force Base is named in honor of General Muir S. Fairchild (1894–1950). Born in Bellingham, he graduated from Olympia High School and attended the University of Washington in Seattle.

Fairchild received his wings and commission in 1918, and served as a pilot during World War I. He held various air staff positions during World War II and received his fourth star in 1948. While serving as Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, he died on 17 March 1950.
===Operational history===
Since 1942, Fairchild Air Force Base/Station has been a key part of the United States&#x27; defense strategy—from World War II repair depot, to Strategic Air Command bomber wing during the Cold War, to Air Mobility Command air refueling wing during Operation IRAQI FREEDOM. Today, Fairchild&#x27;s aircraft and personnel make up the backbone of the Air Force&#x27;s tanker fleet on the west coast.

Fairchild&#x27;s location, west of Spokane, resulted from a competition with the cities of Seattle and Everett in western Washington. The War Department chose Spokane for several reasons: better weather conditions for flying, the location from the coast, and the Cascade Range providing a natural barrier against possible Japanese attack.

As an added incentive to the War Department, many Spokane businesses and public-minded citizens donated money to purchase land for the base. At a cost of more than $125,000, these people bought and presented the title to the War Department in January 1942. That year, the government designated $14 million to purchase more land and begin construction of a new Spokane Army Air Depot.

Spokane Air Depot was served by a rail connection to the Great Northern Railway.

From 1942 until 1946, the base served as a repair depot for damaged aircraft returning from the Pacific Theater. The depot command at the base went through several name changes, at one point being designated the Spokane Air Technical Service Command. Effective at 2359L on 31 August 1947, the base was transferred to the Strategic Air Command (SAC) and assigned to the 15th Air Force (15 AF). Beginning in the summer of 1947, the 92nd and 98th Bomb Groups arrived. Both of the units flew the most advanced bomber of the day, the B-29 Superfortress. In January 1948, the base received the second of its three official names: Spokane Air Force Base.

With the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, both groups deployed to Japan and Guam. The 92d departed on 4 July 1950 and the 98th followed in August. After only a few months, General MacArthur released the 92nd to return to the states while the 98th remained in the Far East. The 98th was then reassigned to Nebraska. Upon its return to Fairchild, the 92nd was re-designated the 92d Bombardment Wing (Heavy). In November 1950, the base took its current name in memory of Air Force Vice Chief of Staff, General Muir S. Fairchild, a native of Bellingham. The general entered service as a sergeant with the Washington National Guard in June 1916 and was an aviator in World War I. He died at his quarters at Fort Myer while on duty in the Pentagon in March 1950. The formal dedication ceremony was held 20 July 1951, to coincide with the arrival of the wing&#x27;s first B-36 Peacemaker.

===B-52 Stratofortress and KC-135 Stratotanker===
In 1956, the wing began a conversion that brought the first of 45 B-52 Stratofortress bombers on 26 March 1957 to Fairchild, followed by first of twenty KC-135 Stratotanker on 21 February 1958. In 1961, the 92d became the first &quot;aerospace&quot; wing in the nation with the acquisition of the Atlas-E intercontinental ballistic missile, operated by the 567th Strategic Missile Squadron. With the new role and the addition of missiles, the 92d Bomb Wing was re-designated the 92d Strategic Aerospace Wing. However, the designation remained longer than the missiles, as the Atlas missiles were soon obsolete and removed in 1965.

The weapons storage area (WSA) for the bombers was located south of the runway at Deep Creek Air Force Station, a separate installation constructed from 1950 to 1953 by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and operated by the Air Materiel Command. The facility was one of the thirteen original sites built for storage, maintenance, and operational readiness of the nuclear stockpile. Deep Creek became part of Fairchild AFB on 1 July 1962, with operations transferred to SAC.

On 15 March 1966, the 336th Combat Crew Training Group was established at Fairchild. In 1971, the group became a wing and assumed control over all Air Force survival schools. Later reduced to a group level command, the unit, now known as the 336th Training Group, continues this mission for the Air Education and Training Command (AETC).

To provide air defense of the base, U.S. Army Nike-Hercules surface-to-air missile sites were constructed during 1956/1957. Sites were located near Cheney (F-37) ; Deep Creek (F-87) ; Medical Lake (F-45) , and Spokane (F-07) . The Cheney site was active between 1957 – June 1960; Deep Creek Sep 1958 – March 1966; Medical Lake 1957 – March 1966 and the Spokane site between 1957 and June 1960.

On 16 October 1984, an unarmed B-52G (57-6479) from Fairchild crashed in northeast Arizona during a nighttime low-level training flight, with five survivors and two fatalities: the gunner and a colonel in the observer jump seat.

In 1985, Fairchild&#x27;s fifteen B-52G aircraft were replaced with nineteen B-52H; a slightly newer version with more powerful turbofan engines.

===Air refueling===
As military operations in Vietnam escalated in the mid-1960s, the demand for air refueling increased. Fairchild tanker crews became actively involved in Operation YOUNG TIGER, refueling combat aircraft in Southeast Asia. The wing&#x27;s B-52s were not far behind, deploying to Andersen AFB on Guam for Operation Arc Light and the bombing campaign against enemy strongholds in Vietnam.

On 10 September 1962, an inbound KC-135A from Ellsworth AFB in South Dakota with 44 aboard crashed into fog-shrouded Mount Kit Carson, just west of Mount Spokane. The incident occurred late in the morning and there were no survivors; it was attributed to a navigational error by the crew. Less than five years later, another crash occurred in the same general area. Returning from Hickam AFB in Hawaii on 19 January 1967, a Fairchild-based KC-135A crashed southeast of Mount Spokane shortly after sunset; all nine on board were killed.

In late 1974, the Air Force announced plans to convert the 141st Fighter Interceptor Group of the Washington Air National Guard, an F-101 Voodoo unit at Geiger Field, to an air refueling mission with KC-135 aircraft. The unit would then be renamed the 141st Air Refueling Wing (141 ARW) and move to Fairchild. Work began soon thereafter and by 1976 eight KC-135E aircraft transferred to the new 141 ARW. Today, the 141 ARW continues its air mobility mission, flying the KC-135R model.

On 23 January 1987, following the inactivation of the 47th Air Division at Fairchild, the 92nd Bombardment Wing was reassigned to the 57th Air Division at Minot AFB in North Dakota. Less than two months later on 13 March, a KC-135A crashed into a field adjacent to the 92nd Bomb Wing headquarters and the taxiway during a practice flight for a low-level in-flight refueling demonstration planned for later that month. Seven were killed in the crash, all USAF personnel, six aboard the aircraft, and a motorist on the ground.

Following Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, a total of 560 base personnel deployed to Desert Shield and Desert Storm from August 1990 to March 1991. The 43d and 92d Air Refueling Squadrons flew a combined total of 4,004 hours, 721 sorties, and off-loaded a total of 22.5 million pounds of fuel to coalition aircraft.

On 1 September 1991, under Air Force reorganization, the 92d Bombardment Wing (Heavy) was re-designated the 92d Wing, emphasizing a dual bombing and refueling role.

With the inactivation of the Strategic Air Command (SAC) in June 1992, the B-52 portion of the wing became part of the newly established Air Combat Command (ACC) and was re-designated the 92d Bomb Wing. As SAC finished 46 years of service to the nation, Fairchild bomber and tanker crews took top honors at Proud Shield &#x27;92, SAC&#x27;s final bombing/navigation competition. The wing won the Fairchild Trophy for best bomber/tanker team as well as the Saunders Trophy for the tanker unit attaining the most points on all competition missions.

7 December 1993 marked the beginning of a significant change in the mission of Fairchild when the B-52s were transferred to another ACC base while the KC-135s, now assigned to the newly established Air Mobility Command (AMC) would remain. This was the first step in Fairchild&#x27;s transition to an air refueling wing. The departure of B-52s continued throughout the spring of 1994, with most of the bombers gone by 25 May 1994.

===Air refueling wing===

On 1 July 1994, the 92d Bomb Wing was re-designated the 92d Air Refueling Wing (92 ARW), and Fairchild AFB was transferred from ACC to Air Mobility Command (AMC) in a ceremony marking the creation of the largest air refueling wing in the Air Force. Dubbed as the new &quot;tanker hub of the Northwest,&quot; the wing was capable of maintaining an air bridge across the nation and the world in support of US and allied forces.

Since 1994, the 92 ARW has been involved in many contingency missions around the world. 92 ARW KC-135s have routinely supported special airlift missions in response to world events or international treaty compliance requirements.

In 1995 aircraft from Fairchild flew to Travis AFB, California in support of its first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) mission, transporting Russian inspectors to sites in the Western U.S. The wing has flown START missions in the U.S. every year since. And in May 2000, the wing became the first active duty KC-135 unit to transport U.S. inspectors on a START mission into Ulan Ude, Russia.

Throughout much of the 1990s, the wing was actively involved in missions against Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. The wing also deployed aircraft and personnel in 1999 to support Operation Allied Force.

Following the destruction of the World Trade Center, the wing began providing around-the-clock air refueling of Combat Air Patrol fighter aircraft and initiated 24-hour ground alert operations in support of Operation Noble Eagle. The wing also began a series of extended Operation Enduring Freedom deployments for aircrews and maintainers as well as combat support and medical personnel.

===Intercontinental ballistic missile facilities===

The 567th Strategic Missile Squadron operated nine SM-65E Atlas ICBM sites (1 April 1960 – 25 June 1965).
* 567–1, 3.4 mi ENE of Deer Park, WA

* 567–9, 8.9 mi NNE of Reardan, WA 

On 14 July 1958, the Army Corps of Engineers Northern Pacific Division directed its Seattle District to begin survey and mapping operations for the first Atlas-E site to be located in the vicinity of Spokane. Originally, the Air Force wanted three sites with three missiles at each (3 x 3); however, in early 1959, the Air Force opted to disperse the missiles to nine individual sites as a defensive safety measure. Work started at Site A on 12 May 1959, and completion at Site I occurred on 10 February 1961. Auxiliary support facilities for each site were built concurrent with the launchers. Support facilities at Fairchild AFB, including a liquid oxygen plant, were completed by January 1961.
Activation of the 567th Strategic Missile Squadron on 1 April 1960, marked the first time SAC activated an E series Atlas unit. On 3 December 1960, the first Atlas E missile arrived at the 567th SMS. Construction continued and SAC accepted the first Series E Atlas complex on 29 July 1961. Operational readiness training, which previously had been conducted only at Vandenberg AFB, California, began at Fairchild during the following month. On 28 September 1961, Headquarters SAC declared the squadron operational and during the following month, the 567th placed the first Atlas E missile on alert status. The bulk of the Fairchild force was on alert status in November.

As a result of Defense Secretary Robert McNamara&#x27;s May 1964 directive accelerating the phaseout of Atlas and Titan I ICBMs, the first Atlas missiles came off line at Fairchild in January 1965. On 31 March, the last missile came off alert status, which marked the completion of Atlas phaseout. The squadron was inactivated within three months.

Today all of the former missile sites still exist and most appear to be in good condition. Most of them are in agricultural areas and presumably are being used to support farmers by storage of equipment and other material. Site &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; appear to be redeveloped into light industrial estates; &quot;4&quot; and &quot;6&quot; appear to be converted into private residences.

== Incidents ==

===1994 shooting===

On 20 June 1994, 20-year-old Dean Mellberg, an ex-Air Force member, entered the base hospital and shot and killed four people and wounded 22 others.

Previously, psychologists Major Thomas Brigham and Captain Alan London at Fairchild AFB had found him unfit for duty, which resulted in a transfer to the Wilford Hall Medical Center at Lackland AFB for further psychological examination. With Congressional pressure brought by Mellberg&#x27;s mother, Airman Mellberg was found to be fit for military service. Airman Mellberg then was reassigned to Cannon Air Force Base where similar events led to him being returned to psychologists for evaluation. After this evaluation, he was discharged from Cannon AFB as being unfit for military service; he had been diagnosed with mild autism, generalized anxiety disorder and paranoid personality disorder. 

Mellberg traveled to Spokane, Washington, near Fairchild AFB, where he purchased a rifle and planned his attack on the base. At the time of the shooting, Fairchild&#x27;s hospital was an ungated facility. Mellberg took a cab to the base with a large duffle bag and foam gun case, four weeks to the day following his discharge. The gunman, armed with a Chinese-made MAK-90, an AK-47 clone, entered the office of Brigham and London and killed both men. Mellberg continued to move through the hospital, injuring several people, and killing eight-year-old Christin McCarron. The gunman then walked out of the building into the parking lot and killed Anita Lindner. He then was confronted by a security policeman, Senior Airman Andy Brown. From approximately 70 yards away, Brown ordered Mellberg to drop his weapon. After Mellberg refused, Brown fired four shots from his 9mm pistol, with two rounds hitting the perpetrator in the head and shoulder, killing him. 

A pregnant woman shot in the stomach also subsequently lost her unborn child. After an investigation it was concluded that Airman Brown was justified in his actions, probably having saved lives, and he was awarded the Airman&#x27;s Medal by President Bill Clinton. In 2016, Brown published &quot;Warnings Unheeded: Twin Tragedies at Fairchild Air Force Base&quot;. The book reveals the pre-incident indicators of the shooting and the fatal crash of a B-52 bomber that occurred four days afterward.

=== Perpetrator ===
Dean&#x27;s concerning behavior was long recognized prior to his dismissal from the military. During basic training, in three different psychological examinations it was noted that he should be discharged. However, he was allowed to complete his basic training and earn his uniform. After a short time in the hospital, he was deemed fit to return and requested a transfer. After his transfer, he was discharged within two months due to symptoms of his personality disorder. Psychologists after the shooting speculate that the removal of his uniform at dismissal may have been a triggering factor to his rampage.

=== 1994 plane crash ===
On 24 June 1994, just four days after the base hospital shooting, one of the few remaining B-52H bombers at Fairchild crashed during a practice flight for an upcoming air show, killing all four crew members. Pilot error as a result of reckless flying by one of the pilots was determined to be the cause of the crash.

==Role and operations==

Fairchild is home to a wide variety of units and missions. Most prominent is its air refueling mission, with two wings, one active, the 92nd Air Refueling Wing, and one national guard, the 141st Air Refueling Wing, both flying the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker. The 92nd Air Refueling Wing comprises the 92nd Operations Group which provides air mobility for America through air refueling, airlift, and operational support, the 92d Maintenance Group which provides maintenance support to aircraft and equipment, the 92nd Mission Support Group which provides the foundation for support and morale of Fairchild and the 92nd Medical Group.

As of July 2021, Fairchild was the USAF&#x27;s largest KC-135 operating location, with 63 aircraft assigned.

Other units here include the Air Force Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape school, medical detachments, a weapons squadron and the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency.

Over 5,200 active duty Air Force, Air National Guard, and tenant organization military and civilian employees work on Fairchild, making the base the largest employer in Eastern Washington. Fairchild&#x27;s annual economic impact on the Spokane community is approximately $427 million, constituting 13 percent of the local economy.

==Weaponry==
At one time in the early 1990s, Washington state had the distinction of having more nuclear warheads than four of the six known nuclear-armed nations. These warheads were concentrated in two places: at Fairchild AFB and at the Kitsap submarine base across Puget Sound, on the Hood Canal. At Fairchild, 85 nuclear gravity bombs (25 B61-7 gravity bombs and 60 B83 gravity bombs) were stored in a reserve nuclear depot. Naval Base Kitsap&#x27;s eight &quot;Ohio&quot;-class submarines, carrying up to 24 of the now-decommissioned UGM-96 Trident I missiles per boat, each capable of carrying up to eight warheads per missile, for a total of 1,536. The gravity bombs were removed from the base by the end of the 1990s.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 6.5 square miles (16.8 km2), all of it land. Spokane International Airport is located just four miles to the east.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2010, there were 2,736 people. At the 2000 census there were, 1,071 households, and 1,048 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 670.2 people per square mile (258.8/km2). There were 1,114 housing units at an average density of 171.3/sq mi (66.2/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 78.20% White, 7.90% African American, 0.53% Native American, 3.56% Asian, 0.37% Pacific Islander, 3.79% from other races, and 5.67% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 8.52% of the population.

There were 1,071 households, out of which 72.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 90.8% were married couples living together, 4.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 2.1% were non-families. 1.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and none had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.36 and the average family size was 3.39.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 34.1% under the age of 18, 24.9% from 18 to 24, 38.3% from 25 to 44, 2.1% from 45 to 64, and 0.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 23 years. For every 100 females, there were 127.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 135.7 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $33,512, and the median income for a family was $33,398. Males had a median income of $22,299 versus $15,815 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $11,961. About 4.8% of families and 5.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 6.4% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.

==Public schools==

The base housing area at Fairchild is within the Medical Lake School District (#326). An elementary school (K-5) is on base, renamed for Space Shuttle astronaut Michael Anderson. Students in middle school (6–8) and high school (9–12)
attend classes in the city of Medical Lake, a few miles to the south. Significantly smaller than the public high schools in Spokane, Medical Lake High School competes in WIAA Class 1A in athletics in the Northeast &#x27;A&#x27; League (NEA).

<doc id="138260" wikidata="Q937129" url="?curid=138260" title="Latah, Washington">
<text>Latah is a town in Spokane County, Washington, United States. The population was 185 at the 2020 census. It was named for the nearby creek, Latah Creek, from the native word for fish. The town was formerly called, Hangman&#x27;s Creek and Alpha.

==History==
Latah Valley saw its first wave of settlers about 1872, which included Richard and Lydia Wimpy family, Hosea and Harriette Harvey family, and Henry and Julia Coplan family. In those days, the settlement took the name of the nearby stream, Hangman&#x27;s Creek. The stream received its name from the tragic events of 1858, when Col. George Wright hanged several members of the local native tribes in retaliation for the defeat of Lt. Col. Edward J. Steptoe at the Battle of Pine Creek. The exact jurisdiction seems to have been of question in the beginning, as the first postmaster of &quot;Hangman&#x27;s Creek&quot; was Richard H Wimpy, appointed March 19, 1873, in Nez Perce County, Idaho. The post office was transferred to Stevens County, Washington Territory, on May 5, 1873, with R. H. Wimpy still the postmaster. That section of Stevens County became Whitman County, and finally Spokane County. Meanwhile, Hangman&#x27;s Creek changed to &quot;Alpha&quot; on April 25, 1881, under postmaster Emery H. Averill, so named because it was the first settlement in the area. Alpha changed to &quot;Latah&quot;, on December 11, 1883, under postmaster David T. Ham, again naming it after the nearby stream, Latah Creek. The legislature had decided to rename the stream Latah, from the native word &quot;lahtoo,&quot; which means &quot;stream where little fish are caught.&quot; 

This small farming community gained some fame a few years after the settlers arrived. The eldest sons of Henry Coplan/Copeland arrived in 1872, followed by the rest of the family in 1873. In May 1876, the Coplan brothers were examining a boggy piece of land near the creek when they discovered mammoth fossils, along with a collection of other animal fossils, and evidence of prehistoric human activity. The news attracted visitors and scientists to the area, and inspired another set of brothers, William and Thomas Donahoe, to search their own property on Pine Creek. The Donahoe brothers found a gargantuan mammoth skull and other fossils. After extracting a sizable collection, the Coplan brothers, Ben, Alonzo, and Lewis, took their prizes on tour through Washington, Idaho, and Oregon. The Donahoe brothers sent theirs on tour to California. After passing through various other hands, the Donahoe collection was acquired by the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where it still resides. The Coplan collection eventually came into the possession of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago where it remains.

Latah was officially incorporated on April 9, 1892, with Ben Coplan appointed as the first mayor in 1893. Ben&#x27;s famous mammoth served as the centerpiece of the Washington Pavilion at Chicago&#x27;s World Columbian Exposition of 1893.

<doc id="138262" wikidata="Q1506243" url="?curid=138262" title="Medical Lake, Washington">
<text>Medical Lake is a small city in Spokane County, eastern Washington, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 4,874. The city is the site of a psychiatric hospital, Eastern State Hospital, and of Fairchild Air Force Base, two major employers.

==History==
The city of Medical Lake was incorporated in 1890. The city took its name from the nearby eponymous lake.

The Spokane people, a Native American tribe which had long inhabited the area, believed the water and mud of the lake to possess curative properties.

White settlers such as Andrew Lefevre and Stanley Hallett, who moved to the area in the 1870s, promoted this belief and marketed the lake salts for medicinal uses. A salt and soap industry developed here, followed by the construction of commercial bath houses in the 1880s. This was a period when springs and spas were popular developments across the country.

Several resort hotels were constructed along the lake shore. In 1891, the state constructed Eastern State Hospital, and this further stimulated economic growth in the city. Such growth continued until the 1920s, when the lake declined in popularity as a tourist destination.

A period of stagnation was interrupted in the 1940s with the construction of nearby Fairchild Air Force Base to support the US effort in World War II. This brought a surge of population to the city. Medical Lake&#x27;s economy continues to depend upon the institutional presence of Eastern State Hospital and Fairchild AFB. Many residents of the city commute to work in nearby Spokane, which has a more varied economy.

Several parts of the city were destroyed by the Gray Fire, a wildfire that began on August 18, 2023, and burned over and 185 structures in the area. Medical Lake and Eastern State Hospital were evacuated and portions of nearby highways were closed to traffic for several days.

== Geography ==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

The city lies to the east of the lake of the same name. There are many other lakes within a few miles of the city, including West Medical Lake, Silver Lake, Clear Lake, and numerous smaller lakes and ponds south of the city. Driving distance from downtown Spokane is 16 miles via Interstate 90 and Washington State Route 902, the latter of which runs through the city. Eastern State Hospital is situated across the lake to the west. Fairchild Air Force Base is located immediately north of the city.

Geologically, the city lies on basalt flows that were heavily eroded by catastrophic flooding at the end of the last Ice Age, making the city and its environs a part of the Channeled Scablands terrain.

<text>Millwood is a city in Spokane County, Washington, United States. The population was 1,786 at the 2010 census. Millwood is a suburb of Spokane, and is surrounded on three sides by the city of Spokane Valley. The Spokane River flows along the northern edge of the city. The city is home to the National Register of Historic Places listed Millwood Historic District.

== Government ==
The city government is organized using the Mayor-Council form. The mayor as of November 2022 is Kevin Freeman, who was first elected in November 2013 and took office in January 2014. In November 2017, he was elected to his second term. Freeman is simultaneously a member of the board of directors for the Spokane Regional Health District, and the Spokane Regional Clean Air Agency. The city council consists of five members, who are elected to serve terms of four years.

==History==
Millwood was officially incorporated on October 26, 1927. It was named for the local sawmill.

According to the Tacoma Public Library&#x27;s Washington Place Names database: &quot;In 1900, it was chosen as a station by the Spokane-Coeur d&#x27;Alene Electric Railway, and was named Woodard&#x27;s for the family who owned the land along the railway route. When Inland Empire Paper Company built a paper mill they requested a name change to Milltown. Railway officials refused the change unless the Woodard family agreed. A compromise resulted, using the word mill combined with the first four letters of Woodard. It was incorporated October 27, 1927.&quot;

The Rosebush House, located in the center of Millwood, &quot;is one of Millwood&#x27;s best preserved homes&quot; and is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Spokane ( ) is the most populous city in eastern Washington and the county seat of Spokane County, Washington, United States. It lies along the Spokane River, adjacent to the Selkirk Mountains, and west of the Rocky Mountain foothills, south of the Canadian border, west of the Washington–Idaho border, and east of Seattle, along Interstate 90.

Spokane is the economic and cultural center of the Spokane metropolitan area, the Spokane–Coeur d&#x27;Alene combined statistical area, and the Inland Northwest. It is known as the birthplace of Father&#x27;s Day, and locally by the nickname of &quot;Lilac City&quot;. Officially, Spokane goes by the nickname of &quot;Hooptown USA&quot;, due to Spokane&#x27;s annual hosting of the Spokane Hoopfest, the world&#x27;s largest basketball tournament. The city and the wider Inland Northwest area are served by Spokane International Airport, west of Downtown Spokane, which is located near another airfield at Fairchild Air Force Base. According to the 2010 census, Spokane had a population of 208,916, making it the 2nd-most populous city in Washington, and the 101st-most populous city in the United States. At the 2020 census, Spokane&#x27;s population was 228,989. A 2023 estimate sets the population of the metropolitan area at 600,292.

The first people to live in the area, the Spokane tribe (their name meaning &quot;children of the sun&quot; in Salishan), lived off plentiful game. David Thompson explored the area with the westward expansion and establishment of the North West Company&#x27;s Spokane House in 1810. This trading post was the first long-term European settlement in Washington. Completion of the Northern Pacific Railway in 1881 brought many settlers from America to the Spokane area. The same year it was officially incorporated as a city under the name of &quot;Spokane Falls&quot; (it was re-incorporated under its current name ten years later). In the late 19th century, gold and silver were discovered in the Inland Northwest. The local economy depended on mining, timber, and agriculture until the 1980s. Spokane hosted the first environmentally themed World&#x27;s fair at Expo &#x27;74.

Many of the downtown area&#x27;s older Romanesque Revival-style buildings were designed by architect Kirtland Kelsey Cutter after the Great Spokane Fire of 1889, which damaged much of the downtown commercial district. The city is also home to the Riverfront and Manito parks, the Smithsonian-affiliated Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture, the Davenport Hotel, and the Fox and Bing Crosby theaters.

The Cathedral of Our Lady of Lourdes is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Spokane, and the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist serves as that of the Episcopal Diocese of Spokane. The Spokane Washington Temple in the east of the county serves the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Gonzaga University was established in 1887 by the Jesuits, and the private Presbyterian Whitworth University was founded three years later and moved to north Spokane in 1914.

In sports, the region&#x27;s professional and semi-professional sports teams include the Spokane Indians in Minor League Baseball. The Spokane Chiefs in the Western Hockey League. The Spokane Velocity in USL League One with a women&#x27;s first division team Spokane Zephyr FC in USL Super League. The Gonzaga Bulldogs collegiate basketball team competes at the Division I level. As of 2010, Spokane&#x27;s major daily newspaper, &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot;, had a daily circulation of over 76,000.

==History==

The first humans to live in the Spokane area were hunter-gatherers that lived off plentiful fish and game; early human remains have been dated to 8,000 to 13,000 years ago. The Spokane tribe, after which the city is named (the name meaning &quot;children of the sun&quot; or &quot;sun people&quot; in Salishan), are believed to be either their direct descendants, or descendants of people from the Great Plains. When asked by early white explorers, the Spokanes said their ancestors came from &quot;up North.&quot; Early in the 19th century, the Northwest Fur Company sent two white fur trappers west of the Rocky Mountains to search for fur. These were the first white men met by the Spokanes, who believed they were sacred, and set the trappers up in the Colville River valley for the winter.

===Trading post===
The explorer-geographer David Thompson, working as head of the North West Company&#x27;s Columbia Department, became the first European to explore the Inland Empire (now called the Inland Northwest). Crossing what is now the Canada–US border from British Columbia, Thompson wanted to expand the North West Company further south in search of furs. After establishing the Kullyspell House and Saleesh House trading posts in what are now Idaho and Montana, Thompson then attempted to expand further west. He sent out two trappers, Jacques Raphael Finlay and Finan McDonald, to construct a fur trading post on the Spokane River, which flows west from Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene to the Columbia River, and trade with the local Indians. This post was established in 1810, at the confluence of the Little Spokane and Spokane rivers, becoming the first enduring European settlement of significance in what later became Washington state. Known as the Spokane House, or simply &quot;Spokane&quot;, it was in operation from 1810 to 1826. Operations were run by the British North West Company and later the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, and the post was the headquarters of the fur trade between the Rocky and Cascade mountains for 16 years. After the latter business absorbed the North West Company in 1821, the major operations at the Spokane House were eventually shifted north to Fort Colville, reducing the post&#x27;s significance.

In 1836, Reverend Samuel Parker visited the area and reported that around 800 Native Americans were living in Spokane Falls. A medical mission was established by Marcus and Narcissa Whitman to cater for Cayuse Indians and hikers of the Oregon Trail at Walla Walla in the south. 
After the Whitmans were killed by Indians in 1847, Reverend Cushing Eells established Whitman College in their memory, also setting up the first church in the Spokane area.

In 1853, two years after the establishment of the Washington Territory, the first governor, Isaac Stevens, made an initial effort to make a treaty with Chief Garry and the Spokanes at Antoine Plantes&#x27; Ferry, not far from Millwood. After the last campaign of the Yakima Indian War, the Coeur d&#x27;Alene War of 1858 was brought to a close by the actions of Col. George Wright, who won decisive victories against a confederation of tribes in engagements at the battles of Four Lakes and Spokane Plains. The cessation of hostilities opened the inter-mountain valley of the Pacific Northwest to colonial expansion and safe habitation by settlers.

===American settlement===

Joint American–British occupation of Oregon Country, in effect since the Treaty of 1818, eventually led to the Oregon Boundary Dispute after a large influx of American settlers along the Oregon Trail. Great Britain ceded its claims to lands in Puget Sound and the central and lower Columbia Basin by the Oregon Treaty of 1846. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company wound up its operations in the area over the next few years.

In what is now Spokane, the first American settlers were J.J. Downing and S.R. Scranton, cattle ranchers who squatted and established a claim at Spokane Falls in 1871. Together they built a small sawmill on a claim near the south bank of the falls. James N. Glover and Jasper Matheney, Oregonians passing through the region in 1873, recognized the value of the Spokane River and its falls for the purpose of water power. They realized the investment potential and bought the claims of and the sawmill from Downing and Scranton for a total of $4,000. Glover and Matheney knew that the Northern Pacific Railroad Company had received a government charter to build a main line across this northern route. Amid many delays in construction and uncertainty over the completion of the railroad and its exact course, Matheney sold his interest in the claim to Glover. Glover confidently held on to his claim and became a successful Spokane business owner and the city&#x27;s second mayor. He later came to be known as the &quot;Father of Spokane&quot;.

In 1880, Fort Spokane was established by U.S. Army troops under Lt. Col. Henry C. Merriam northwest of Spokane, at the junction of the Columbia and Spokane Rivers, to protect the construction of the Northern Pacific Railway and secure a place for U.S. settlement. By June 30, 1881, the railway reached the city, bringing major European settlement to the area. The city was officially incorporated with a population of about 1,000 residents on November 29, 1881. When Spokane was officially incorporated in 1881, Robert W. Forrest was elected as the first mayor of the city, with a Council of seven, S.G. Havermale, A.M. Cannon, Dr. L.H. Whitehouse, L.W. Rima, F.R. Moore, George A. Davis, and W.C. Gray, all serving without pay. The marketing campaigns of transportation companies with affordable fertile land to sell along their trade routes lured many settlers into the region they dubbed &quot;Spokane Country&quot;.

The 1883 discovery of gold, silver, and lead in the Coeur d&#x27;Alene region of northern Idaho lured prospectors. The Inland Empire erupted with numerous mining rushes from 1883 to 1892. Mining and smelting emerged as a major stimulus to Spokane. At the onset of the initial 1883 gold rush in the nearby Coeur d&#x27;Alene mining district, Spokane became popular with prospectors, offering low prices on everything &quot;from a horse to a frying pan&quot;. It would keep this status for subsequent rushes in the region due to its trade center status and accessibility to railroad infrastructure.

Spokane&#x27;s growth continued unabated until August 4, 1889, when a fire, now known as The Great Fire (not to be confused with the Great Fire of 1910, which happened nearby), began just after 6:00 p.m., and destroyed the city&#x27;s downtown commercial district. Due to technical problems with a pump station, there was no water pressure in the city when the fire started. In a desperate bid to starve the fire, firefighters began razing buildings with dynamite. Eventually, the winds and the fire died down; 32 blocks of Spokane&#x27;s downtown core had been destroyed and one person was killed.
Despite this catastrophe, and in part because of it, Spokane experienced a building boom. The downtown was rebuilt, and the city was reincorporated under the present name of &quot;Spokane&quot; in 1891. According to historian David H. Stratton, &quot;From the late 1890s to about 1912, a great flurry of construction created a modern urban profile of office buildings, banks, department stores, hotels and other commercial institutions&quot; which stretched from the Spokane River to the site of the Northern Pacific railroad tracks below the South Hill. Yet the rebuilding and development of the city was far from smooth: between 1889 and 1896 alone, all six bridges over the Spokane River were destroyed by floods before their completion. In the 1890s the city was subject to intrastate migration by African-Americans from Roslyn, looking for work after the closure of the area&#x27;s mines. Two African-American churches, Calvary Baptist and Bethel African Methodist Episcopal, were founded in 1890. Just three years after the fire, in 1892, James J. Hill&#x27;s Great Northern Railway arrived in the chosen site for Hill&#x27;s rail yards, the newly created township of Hillyard (annexed by Spokane in 1924). Spokane became an important rail shipping and transportation hub for the Inland Empire, connecting mines in the Silver Valley with agricultural areas around the Palouse region. The city&#x27;s population ballooned to 19,922 in 1890, and to 36,848 in 1900 with the arrival of additional railroads. By 1910 the population had hit 104,000, and Spokane eclipsed Walla Walla as the commercial center of the Inland Empire. In time the city came to be known as the &quot;capital&quot; of the Inland Empire and the heart of a vast tributary region. After the arrival of the Northern Pacific, Union Pacific, Great Northern, and Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific railroads, Spokane became one of the most important rail centers in the western U.S.

===Early 20th century===
Expansion abruptly stopped in the 1910s and was followed by a period of population decline, due in large part to Spokane&#x27;s slowing economy. Control of regional mines and resources became increasingly dominated by national corporations rather than local people and organizations, diverting capital outside of Spokane and decreasing growth and investment opportunities in the city. During this time of stagnation, unrest was prevalent among the area&#x27;s unemployed, who became victimized by &quot;job sharks&quot;, who charged a fee for signing up workers in the logging camps. Job sharks and employment agencies were known to cheat itinerant workers, sometimes paying bribes to periodically fire entire work crews, thus generating repetitive fees for themselves. Crime spiked in the 1890s and 1900s, with eruptions of violent activity involving unions such as the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), or &quot;Wobblies&quot; as they were often known, whose free speech fights had begun to garner national attention. Now, with grievances concerning the unethical practices of the employment agencies, they initiated a free speech fight in September 1908 by purposely breaking a city ordinance on soapboxing. With IWW encouragement, union members from many western states came to Spokane to take part in what had become a publicity stunt. Many Wobblies were incarcerated, including feminist labor leader Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, who published her account in the local &quot;Industrial Worker&quot;.

After mining declined at the turn of the 20th century, agriculture and logging became the primary influences in the Spokane economy. The population explosion and the building of homes, railroads, and mines in northern Idaho and southern British Columbia fueled the logging industry. Although overshadowed in importance by the vast timbered areas on the coastal regions west of the Cascades, and burdened with monopolistic rail freight rates and stiff competition, Spokane became a noted leader in the manufacture of doors, window sashes, blinds, and other planing mill products. Rail freight rates were much higher in Spokane than the rates in coastal seaport cities such as Seattle and Portland, so much so that Minneapolis merchants could ship goods first to Seattle and then back to Spokane for less than shipping directly to Spokane, even though the rail line ran through Spokane on the way to the coast.

The Inland Northwest region has also long been associated with farming, especially wheat production. Initially, the Palouse was thought to be unsuitable for wheat production due to the hilly terrain, believing wheat could not be cultivated on the tops of the hills, but the region showed great promise for wheat production when it began in the late 1850s in part due to the hilltops. The Palouse was and still is a breadbasket and was able to develop and grow with the completion of several railroad networks as well as a highway system that began to center around the city of Spokane, aiding farmers from around the region in distributing their products to market. Inland Empire farmers exported wheat, livestock and other agricultural products to ports such as New York, Liverpool and Tokyo.

Local morale was affected for years by the collapse of the Division Street Bridge early in the morning on December 15, 1915, which killed five people and injured over 20, but a new bridge was built (eventually replaced in 1994). The 1920 census showed a net increase of just 35 individuals, which actually indicates that thousands left the city when considering the natural growth rate of a population. Growth in the 1920s and 1930s remained slow but less drastically so, forcing city boosters to market the city as a quiet, comfortable place suitable for raising a family rather than a dynamic community full of opportunity. The Inland Empire was heavily dependent on natural resources and goods produced from mines, forests, and farms, which experienced a fall in demand. The situation improved slightly with the start of World War II as aluminum production commenced in Spokane due to the area&#x27;s cheap electricity (produced from regional dams) and the increased demand for airplanes.

===Second half of the 20th century===
After decades of stagnation and slow growth, Spokane businessmen formed Spokane Unlimited in the early 1960s, an organization that sought to revitalize downtown Spokane. A recreation park showcasing the Spokane Falls was the preferred option, and after successful negotiation to relocate the railroad facilities on Havermale Island, they executed on a proposal to host the first environmentally themed World&#x27;s Fair in Expo &#x27;74 on May 4, becoming the smallest city at the time to host a World&#x27;s Fair. This event transformed Spokane&#x27;s downtown, removing a century of railroad infrastructure and re-inventing the urban core. After Expo &#x27;74, the fairgrounds became the Riverfront Park.

The growth witnessed in the late 1970s and early 1980s was interrupted by another U.S. recession in 1981, in which silver, timber, and farm prices dropped. The period of decline for the city lasted into the 1990s and was also marked by a loss of many steady family-wage jobs in the manufacturing sector. At this time, market forces began to impact the local Kaiser Aluminum plant and layoffs, pension cuts, a 1998–1999 labor strike, and eventually bankruptcy in 2002 followed. Although this was a tough period, Spokane&#x27;s economy had started to benefit from some measure of economic diversification; growing companies such as Key Tronic and other research, marketing, and assembly plants for technology companies helped lessen Spokane&#x27;s dependence on natural resources.

===21st century===
As of 2014, Spokane is still trying to make the transition to a more service-oriented economy in the face of a less prominent manufacturing sector. Developing the city&#x27;s strength in the medical and health sciences fields has seen some success, resulting in the expansion of the University District with two medical school branches. The city faces challenges such as a scarcity of high-paying jobs, pockets of poverty, and areas of high crime.

The opening of the River Park Square in 1999 served as a catalyst and sparked a downtown rebirth that included the building of the Spokane Arena and expansion of the Spokane Convention Center. Other major projects include the building of the Big Easy concert house (now the Knitting Factory) and renovation of the historic Montvale Hotel, the Kirtland Cutter-designed Davenport Hotel (after being vacant for over 20 years), the Fox Theater (now home to the Spokane Symphony) as well as the completion of the WSU Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences Building in 2013 and the Davenport Grand Hotel in 2015, Ridpath Hotel in 2018 and the ongoing renovation of Riverfront Park (as of May 2019). The Kendall Yards development on the west side of downtown Spokane is one of the largest construction projects in the city&#x27;s history. Directly across the Spokane River from downtown, it will blend residential and retail space with plazas and walking trails.

==Geography==

===Topography===
Spokane is located on the Spokane River in eastern Washington at an elevation of above sea level, about from Idaho, south of the Canadian border, due east of Seattle, and southwest of Calgary. The lowest elevation in the city of Spokane is the northernmost point of the Spokane River within city limits (in Riverside State Park) at ; the highest elevation is on the northeast side, near the community of Hillyard (though closer to Beacon Hill and the North Hill Reservoir) at . Spokane is part of the Inland Northwest region, consisting of eastern Washington, north Idaho, northwestern Montana, and northeastern Oregon. The city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Spokane lies mostly within the Spokane Valley Outwash Plains at the periphery of the North Central Rockies forests ecoregion and partly within the eastern edge of the basaltic Channeled Scablands steppe of the Columbia Plateau ecoregion, a plain that eventually rises sharply to the east towards the rugged, timbered Selkirk Mountains. The foothills of the Rockies—the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Mountains—rise about to the east in north Idaho. The city is in a transition area between the barren landscape of the Columbia Basin and the coniferous forests to the east; to the south are the lush prairies and rolling hills of the Palouse. The highest peak in Spokane County is Mount Spokane, at an elevation of , on the eastern side of the Selkirk Mountains. The Spokane River is the area&#x27;s most prominent water feature, a tributary of the Columbia River, originating from Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene in northern Idaho. The river flows west across the Washington state line through downtown Spokane, meeting Latah Creek, then turns to the northwest, where it is joined by the Little Spokane River on its way to the Columbia River, north of Davenport. The Channeled Scablands and many of the area&#x27;s numerous large lakes, such as Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene and Lake Pend Oreille, were formed by the Missoula Floods after the ice-dammed Glacial Lake Missoula ruptured at the end of the last ice age. The Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge south of Cheney is the closest natural reserve, the closest National Forest is the Colville National Forest, the closest National Recreation Area is the Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area and the closest national park is Mount Rainier National Park, approximately a four-and-a-half hour drive from Spokane.

=== Cityscape ===

==== Neighborhoods ====

Spokane&#x27;s neighborhoods range from the Victorian-style South Hill and Browne&#x27;s Addition, to the Davenport District of Downtown, to the more contemporary neighborhoods of north Spokane. Spokane&#x27;s neighborhoods are gaining attention for their history, as illustrated by the city being home to 18 recognized National Register Historical Districts.

Some of Spokane&#x27;s best-known neighborhoods are Riverside, Browne&#x27;s Addition, and Hillyard. The Riverside neighborhood consists primarily of downtown Spokane and is the central business district of Spokane. The neighborhoods south of downtown Spokane are collectively known as the South Hill. Downtown Spokane contains many of the city&#x27;s public facilities, including City Hall, Riverfront Park (site of Expo &#x27;74), and the Spokane Convention Center, First Interstate Center for the Arts and Spokane Arena. The Spokane County Courthouse and public safety campus is adjacent to downtown in the historic West Central neighborhood. To the east of downtown is East Central and the adjacent University District and budding &quot;International District&quot;. To the west of downtown is one of Spokane&#x27;s oldest and densest neighborhoods, Browne&#x27;s Addition.

A National Historic District west of Downtown, Browne&#x27;s Addition was Spokane&#x27;s first prestigious address, notable for its array of old mansions built by Spokane&#x27;s early elite in the Queen Anne and early American Craftsman styles. The area houses the Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture. In northeast Spokane, the Hillyard neighborhood began in 1892 as the chosen site for James J. Hill&#x27;s Great Northern Railway yard, placed outside Spokane city limits to avoid &quot;burdensome taxes&quot;. The downtown Hillyard Business District, located on Market Street, was the first Spokane neighborhood listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Many of the former town&#x27;s houses were built to house railroad workers, mainly immigrant laborers working in the local yard, who gave Hillyard an independent, blue-collar character. Hillyard has become a home for much of Spokane&#x27;s growing Russian, Ukrainian, and Southeast Asian communities.

==== Architecture ====
===== Commercial and public buildings =====
Spokane neighborhoods contain a patchwork of architectural styles that give them a distinct identity and illustrate the changes throughout the city&#x27;s history. Most of Spokane&#x27;s notable buildings and landmarks are in the Riverside neighborhood and the downtown commercial district, where many of the buildings were rebuilt after the Great Fire of 1889 in the Romanesque Revival style. Examples include the Great Northern clock tower, Review Building, Cathedral of Our Lady of Lourdes, First Congregational Church, Washington Water Power Post Street substation, Peyton Building, and The Carlyle.

The principal architect of many buildings of this period was Kirtland Kelsey Cutter. Self-taught, he came to Spokane in 1886, and began by designing &quot;Chalet Hohenstein&quot; for himself and other residences for his family, while also working as a bank teller. Other structures designed by Cutter include the Spokane Club, Washington Water Power Substation, Monroe Street Bridge (featured in the city seal), the Steam Plant, and the Davenport Hotel. Built in renaissance and Spanish Revival style, the Davenport Hotel cost two million dollars to complete and included new technologies at the time of its opening in September 1914, such as chilled water, elevators, and air cooling.

In the second half of the 20th century, Spokane again became noticed for its architecture, this time by a new generation of architects in the modernist movement, which flourished in the city. During this period which lasted from 1948 to the mid-1970s, prolific architects in the city gave Spokane a great breadth of mid-century architecture. The modernists in Spokane gave the city a new look and were instrumental in the developments, design, and legacy of the Expo &#x27;74 World&#x27;s Fair in what is now Riverfront Park. 

During this time, one of the city&#x27;s foremost and influential architects was Warren C. Heylman. Heylman&#x27;s career was most productive during the 1960s and 1970s where his main body of work was done in the modernist style, designing numerous residential houses, apartment buildings, and architectural embellishments. Some of his most noteworthy works in Spokane include The Parkade, Spokane International Airport, Spokane Regional Health Building, and the Burlington Northern Latah Creek Bridge over Hangman Valley.

Other well-represented architectural styles downtown include Art Deco (Spokane City Hall, Paulsen Center, Fox Theater, John R. Rogers High School, City Ramp Garage), Renaissance Revival (Steam Plant Square, Thomas S. Foley Courthouse, Legion Building, San Marco), Neoclassical (Masonic Center, Hutton Building, Bing Crosby Theater), Chicago School (U.S. Bank Building, Liberty Building, Old City Hall) and Modernist (The Parkade, Ridpath Hotel, Bank of America Financial Center). The tallest building in the city, at , is the Bank of America Financial Center. Also of note is the Spokane County Courthouse in West Central (the building on the seal of Spokane County), the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Rockwood, the Benewah Milk Bottles in Riverside and Garland, Mount Saint Michael in Hillyard, and the Cambern Dutch Shop Windmill in South Perry.

===== Residential =====

As an early affluent Spokane neighborhood, the Browne&#x27;s Addition neighborhood and residences contain the largest variety of residential architecture in the city. These residences are lavish and personalized, featuring many architectural styles that were popular and trendy in the Pacific Northwest from the late 19th century to 1930, such as the Victorian and Queen Anne styles. In high demand following his firms&#x27; design of the Idaho Building at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair in 1893, Cutter found work constructing many mansions for mining and railroad tycoons such as Patrick &quot;Patsy&quot; Clark and Daniel C. Corbin and son Austin.

The older neighborhoods of the early 20th century, such as West Central, East Central, Logan, Hillyard, and much of the lower South Hill, feature a large concentration of American Craftsman style bungalows. In Hillyard, the most architecturally intact neighborhood in Spokane, 85 percent of these buildings are historic. As the city expanded mainly to the north in the middle of the 20th century, the bungalows in the &quot;minimal traditional&quot; style commonplace from the 1930s to the 1950s tend to predominate in the Northwest, North Hill, and Bemiss neighborhoods. This architectural style occupies the neighborhoods where the integrity of Spokane&#x27;s street grid pattern is largely intact (especially the areas north of downtown and south of Francis Ave.), and the houses have backyard alleys for carports, deliveries, and refuse collection. Contemporary suburbs and architecture are prevalent at the north and south edges of Spokane as well as in the new Kendall Yards neighborhood north of downtown.

==== Parks and recreation ====
In 1907, Spokane&#x27;s board of park commissioners retained the services of the Olmsted Brothers to draw up a plan for Spokane&#x27;s parks. Much of Spokane&#x27;s park land was acquired by the city prior to World War I, establishing it early on as a leader among Western cities in the development of a citywide park system. Spokane has a system of over 87 parks totaling and includes six neighborhood aquatic centers. Some of the most notable parks in Spokane&#x27;s system are Riverfront Park, Manito Park and Botanical Gardens, Riverside State Park, Saint Michael&#x27;s Mission State Park, John A. Finch Arboretum, High Bridge Park and Liberty Park.

Riverfront Park, created after Expo &#x27;74 and occupying the same site, is in downtown Spokane and the site of some of Spokane&#x27;s largest events. The park has views of the Spokane Falls and holds a number of civic attractions, including a skyride, a rebuilt gondola lift that carries visitors across the falls from high above the river gorge. The park also includes the historic hand-carved Riverfront Park Looff carousel created in 1909 by Charles I. D. Looff. Riverfront Park is currently being renovated and modernized (as of October 2016). Manito Park and Botanical Gardens on Spokane&#x27;s South Hill features the Duncan Gardens, a classical European Renaissance-style garden and the Nishinomiya Japanese Garden designed by Nagao Sakurai. Riverside State Park, close to downtown, is a site for outdoor activities such as hiking, mountain biking, and horse riding.

The Spokane area has many trails and rail trails, the most notable of which is the Spokane River Centennial Trail, which features over of paved trails running along the Spokane River from Spokane to the Idaho border. This trail continues on towards Coeur d&#x27;Alene for as the North Idaho Centennial Trail and is often used for alternative transportation and recreational use. In the summer, it has long been popular to visit North Idaho&#x27;s &quot;Lake Country&quot;, such as Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Lake Pend Oreille, Priest Lake, or one of the other nearby bodies of water and beaches. In the winter, the public has access to five ski resorts within a couple hours of the city. The closest of these is the Mt. Spokane Ski and Snowboard Park, which has trails for cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, and dog sledding.

Zoological parks in Spokane include Cat Tales Zoological Park, a wildlife sanctuary primarily for big cats and the Blue Zoo an interactive aquarium in the NorthTown Mall.

===Flora and fauna===

The area supports an abundance of wildlife in part because of its varied geology and natural history. The area contains a wide range of vegetation, from densely wooded coniferous forests to rolling grassy hills and meadows. Ponderosa pine and Douglas fir are common in the drier and lower elevation areas throughout the region. The ponderosa pine is the official tree of the City of Spokane, which is where specimens were first collected by botanist David Douglas in 1826.

The Canadian Rockies ecoregion supports 70 mammals, 16 reptiles and amphibians, 168 birds, and 41 fish species. There is a high concentration of raptors in the area, bald eagles are a common sight near Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene in December and January when kokanee spawn. The most common fish present in area lakes is the Washington-native rainbow trout, which is the official fish of Washington state. Big game common in eastern Washington include black and grizzly bears, caribou, Rocky Mountain elk, bighorn sheep, and cougar. Whitetail deer, mule deer, and moose are also found in abundance. The gray wolf population has been making a recovery in the Inland Northwest. As of June 2016, there are 16 wolf packs in eastern Washington. In August 2016, photo evidence confirmed a solitary wolf in Mount Spokane State Park.

Although the ecoregion remains ecologically intact, it faces conservation challenges that include the negative effects of certain forestry management and logging practices, higher risks of forest fires due to the alteration of the trees that make up the forest composition, and habitat fragmentation as a result of urban sprawl and development, which endangers the long-term survival of vulnerable species such as mountain caribou and the American goshawk.

===Climate===
Spokane has a warm-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dsb&quot; under the Köppen classification), a rare climate due to its elevation and significant winter precipitation; Spokane, however, is adjacent to and sometimes even classified as a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;) because the average temperature for the coldest month is over , though in the US this threshold is often defined to be .

The area typically has a warm, arid climate during the summer months, bracketed by short spring and fall seasons. On average, the warmest month is July and the coolest month is December; July averages , while December averages . Daily temperature ranges are large during the summer, often exceeding , and small during the winter, with a range just above . The record high and low are and , but temperatures of more than or less than are rare. Temperatures of + occur an average of 21 days annually, temperatures of + occur an average of only 1 day annually, and those at or below average 2.2 days a year.
Spokane&#x27;s location, between the Cascades Range to the west and the Rocky Mountains to the east and north, protects it from weather patterns experienced in other parts of the Pacific Northwest. The Cascade Mountains form a barrier to the eastward flow of moist and relatively mild air from the Pacific Ocean in winter and cool air in summer. As a result of the rain shadow effect of the Cascades, the Spokane area has average annual precipitation, less than half of Seattle&#x27;s . Precipitation peaks in December, and summer is the driest time of the year. The Rockies shield Spokane from some of the winter season&#x27;s coldest air masses traveling southward across Canada. In the summer season, Spokane, like much of the western United States, has been experiencing drier conditions and more frequent and larger wildfire events since the late 20th century; the fine particulate matter in the smoke can be carried by the wind and blanket the region in a haze and impact Spokane&#x27;s air quality.


==Demographics==

=== Religion ===
According to the Association of Religion Data Archives&#x27; 2010 Metro Area Membership Report, the denominational affiliations of the Spokane MSA are 64,277 Evangelical Protestant, 682 Black Protestant, 24,826 Mainline Protestant, 754 Orthodox, 66,202 Catholic, 31,674 Other, and 339,338 Unclaimed. As of 2016, there are also at least three Jewish congregations.

The Emanu-El congregation erected the first synagogue in Spokane and the state of Washington on September 14, 1892. The city&#x27;s first mosque opened in 2009 as the Spokane Islamic Center. Spokane, like Washington and the Pacific Northwest region as a whole, is part of the Unchurched Belt, a region characterized by low church membership rates and religious participation. The city serves as the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Spokane, which was established in 1913, and the Episcopal Diocese of Spokane, established in 1929. The Spokane Washington Temple, established in 1999, serves Latter-day Saints from the east of the county.

Spokane has hosted an annual multicultural celebration, Unity in the Community, since 1995. The city has become more diverse in recent decades. People from countries in the former Soviet Union (especially Russians and Ukrainians) form a comparatively large demographic in Spokane and Spokane County, the result of a large influx of immigrants and their families after the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. According to the 2000 Census, the number of people of Russian or Ukrainian ancestry in Spokane County was reported to be 7,700 (4,900 residing in the city of Spokane), amounting to two percent of the county. Among the fastest-growing demographics in Spokane is the Pacific Islander ethnic group, which is estimated to be the third-largest minority group in the county, after the Russian and Ukrainian community and Latinos. Spokane was once home to a sizable Asian community, mostly Japanese, centered in a district called Chinatown from the early days of the city until 1974. As in many western railway towns, the Asian community started off as an encampment for migrant laborers working on the railroads. The Chinatown Asian community thrived until the 1940s and experienced a population boom during WWII as Japanese families fled the exclusion zones along the coast, after which its population decreased and became integrated and dispersed, losing its Asian character; urban blight and the preparations leading up to Expo &#x27;74 led to Chinatown&#x27;s eventual demolition.

===Metropolitan area===
The Spokane metropolitan area consists of Spokane County. As of the 2022 census estimates, the Spokane metropolitan area had a population of 597,919. Directly east of Spokane County is the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Metropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of Kootenai County, Idaho, anchored by the city of Coeur d&#x27;Alene. The urban areas of the two MSAs largely follow the path of Interstate 90 between Spokane and Coeur d&#x27;Alene. The Spokane area has suffered from suburbanization and urban sprawl in past decades, despite Washington&#x27;s use of urban growth boundaries; the city ranks low among major Northwest cities in population density and smart growth according to the Sightline Institute, however Smart Growth America in a 2014 study ranked the census defined MSA as the 22nd most compact and connected in the nation using their Sprawl Index factors: development density, land use mix, activity centering, and street accessibility. The Spokane and Coeur d&#x27;Alene Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) are now included in a single Combined Statistical Area (CSA) by the Office of Management and Budget. The Spokane–Coeur d&#x27;Alene CSA had around 781,497 residents in 2022.

==Economy==


Spokane became an important rail and shipping center because of its location between mining and farming areas. In the early 1880s, gold and silver were discovered in the Inland Empire; as a regional shipping center, the city furnished supplies to the miners who passed through on their way to the mineral-rich Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Colville and Kootenay districts. The mining districts are still considered among the most productive in North America.

Natural resources have historically been the foundation of Spokane&#x27;s economy, with the mining, logging, and agriculture industries providing much of the region&#x27;s economic activity. After mining declined at the turn of the 20th century, agriculture and logging replaced mining as the primary influences in the economy. Lumberjacks and millmen working in the hundreds of mills along the railroads, rivers, and lakes of northern Washington and Idaho were provisioning themselves in Spokane. Agriculture has always been an important sector in the local economy. The surrounding area, especially to the south is the Palouse, a region that has long been associated with farming, especially wheat production where it is one of the largest wheat producing regions in the United States. As with the mining industry in the late 1880s, Spokane was an important agricultural market and trade center. Inland Empire farmers exported wheat, livestock and other agricultural products to the ports such as New York, Liverpool and Tokyo. Today, a large share of the wheat produced in the region is shipped to Far East markets. The Inland Northwest also supports many vineyards and microbreweries as well. By the early 20th century Spokane was primarily a commercial center rather than an industrial center.

In Spokane, wood and food processing, printing and publishing, primary metal refining and fabrication, electrical and computer equipment, and transportation equipment are leaders in the manufacturing sector. Gold mining company Gold Reserve, and Fortune 1000 company Potlatch Corporation – a forest products company that operates as a real estate investment trust – are headquartered in the city proper. Mining, forestry, and agribusiness remain important to the local and regional economy, but Spokane&#x27;s economy has diversified to include other industries, including the high-tech and biotech sectors. Spokane is becoming a more service-oriented economy in the face of a less prominent manufacturing sector which declined in the 1980s, particularly as a medical and biotechnology center; Fortune 1000 technology company Itron, for instance, is headquartered in the area. Avista Corporation, the holding company of Avista Utilities, is the only company in Spokane that has been listed in the Fortune 500, ranked 299 on the list in 2002. Other companies with head offices in the Spokane area include technology company Key Tronic, vacation rental provider Stay Alfred, and microcar maker Commuter Cars. Despite diversification to new industries, Spokane&#x27;s economy has struggled in recent decades. Spokane was ranked the #1 &quot;Worst City For Jobs&quot; in America in both 2012 and 2015, while also ranking #4 in 2014. Additionally, Forbes named Spokane the &quot;Scam Capital of America&quot; in 2009 due to widespread business fraud. Trends of fraud were noted as far back as 1988, again in 2002, and continuing through 2011.

As of 2013, the top five employers in Spokane are the State of Washington, Spokane Public Schools, Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center and Children&#x27;s Hospital, the 92d Air Refueling Wing, and Spokane County. The largest military facility and employer, the 92d Air Refueling Wing, was stationed at Fairchild Air Force Base near Airway Heights. The leading industries in Spokane for the employed population 16 years and older were educational services, health care, and social assistance (26.5 percent), retail trade (12.7 percent), and arts, entertainment, recreation, and accommodation food services (10.4 percent). As the metropolitan center of the Inland Northwest, as well as parts of southern British Columbia and Alberta, Spokane serves as a commercial, manufacturing, transportation, medical, shopping, and entertainment hub. In 2017, the Spokane–Spokane Valley MSA had a gross metropolitan product of $25.5 billion while the Coeur d&#x27;Alene metropolitan area was $5.93 billion.

As of 2014, economic development in the Spokane area primarily focuses on promoting the following industries: manufacturing (especially aerospace manufacturing), health sciences, professional services, information science and technology, finance and insurance as well as clean technology, and digital media. To aid economic development, the eastern branch of Innovate Washington, a state-supported business incubator was placed in the city.

In recent years, Spokane has become a growing technology hub for both established companies and startups. Fortune 1000 cybersecurity leader, F5, Inc., has two offices in the area with over 250 employees whom are focused on hardware product development, software engineering, global services support, and digital sales. Other established firms are moving to Spokane, such as Remitly, an app-based financial services corporation, which was founded by Josh Hug, a Whitworth University graduate. Ignite Northwest, led by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Tom Simpson, has invested over $100 million through the Spokane Angel Alliance and Ignite to fund and support early stage companies.

==Culture==
===Arts and theater===
Spokane&#x27;s main art districts are located in the Davenport Arts District, the Garland Business District, and East Sprague. The First Friday Artwalk, which occurs the first Friday of every month, is dedicated to local vendors and performers displaying art around downtown. The two most important Artwalk dates (the first Friday of February and October) attract large crowds to the art districts.
The Davenport Arts District has the largest concentration of art galleries and is home to many of Spokane&#x27;s main performing arts venues, including the Knitting Factory, Fox Theater, and Bing Crosby Theater. The Knitting Factory is a concert house that serves as a setting for many mainstream touring musicians and acts. The Martin Woldson Theater at the Fox, restored to its original 1931 Art Deco state after years of being derelict, is home to the Spokane Symphony Orchestra. The Metropolitan Performing Arts Center was restored in 1988 and renamed the Bing Crosby Theater in 2006 to honor the former Spokanite. Touring stand-up comedians are hosted by the Spokane Comedy Club. Theater is provided by Spokane&#x27;s only resident professional company, The Modern Theater, though there are also the Spokane Civic Theatre and several other amateur community theaters and smaller groups. The First Interstate Center for the Arts often hosts large traveling exhibitions, shows, and tours. Spokane was awarded the All-America City Award by the National Civic League in 1974, 2004, and 2015.

Spokane offers an array of musical performances catering to a variety of interests. Spokane&#x27;s local music scene, however, is considered somewhat lacking by the Spokane All-Ages Music Initiative and other critics, who have identified a need for a legitimate all-ages venue for music performances. The Spokane Symphony presents a full season of classical music, and the Spokane Jazz Orchestra, a full season of jazz music. The Spokane Jazz Orchestra, formed in 1962, is a 70-piece orchestra and non-profit organization.

===Museums===
There are several museums in the city, most notably the Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture, located a few blocks from the center of downtown in Browne&#x27;s Addition, amid the mansions of Spokane&#x27;s late 19th-century &quot;Age of Elegance&quot;. A Smithsonian affiliate museum, it houses a large collection of Native American artifacts as well as regional and national traveling art exhibits.

The Mobius Science Center and the related Mobius Kid&#x27;s Museum in downtown Spokane seek to generate interest in science, technology, engineering, and math among the youth in a hands-on experience. The Jundt Art Museum at Gonzaga University features of exhibition space and contains sizable collections of prints from the Bolker, Baruch, Jacobs, and Corita Kent collections. The museum houses glass art by Dale Chihuly, bronze sculptures by Auguste Rodin, tapestries, paintings, ceramics, photographs, and a wide range of gifts, including from the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Foundation and Collections. On the campus of Gonzaga University, the Crosby House, Bing Crosby&#x27;s childhood home, houses the Bing Crosby Memorabilia Room, the world&#x27;s largest Crosby collection with around 200 pieces. A museum of flight showcasing historic airplanes and curated by the Historic Flight Foundation is located at Felts Field.

===Events and activities===
Spokane is known as the birthplace of the national movement started by Sonora Smart Dodd that led to the proposal and the eventual establishment of Father&#x27;s Day as a national holiday in the U.S. The first observation of Father&#x27;s Day in Spokane was on June 19, 1910. Sonora conceived the idea in Spokane&#x27;s Central Methodist Episcopal Church, while listening to a Mother&#x27;s Day sermon.

The Lilac Bloomsday Run, held in the spring on the first Sunday of May, is a race for competitive runners as well as walkers that attracts international competition. Also in May is the Lilac Festival which honors the military, celebrates youth, and showcases the region. Spokane&#x27;s unofficial nickname, the &quot;Lilac City&quot;, refers to a flowering shrub that has flourished since its introduction to the area in the early 20th century. In June the city hosts Spokane Hoopfest, a 3-on-3 basketball tournament, among the largest of its kind. One of Spokane&#x27;s most popular local events is Pig Out in the Park, an annual six-day food and entertainment festival where attendees may eat a variety of foods and listen to free live music concerts featuring local, regional, and national recording artists in Riverfront Park.

The Spokane International Film Festival, held every February, is a small, juried festival that features documentaries and shorts from around the world. The Spokane Gay &amp; Lesbian Film Festival, held every November, features contemporary, independent films of interest to the LGBT community.

Other notable events in the Spokane region include the Spokane County Interstate Fair, Japan Week, Spokane Pride Parade and the Lilac City Comicon. The Spokane County Interstate Fair is held annually in September at the Spokane County Fair and Expo Center in Spokane Valley. Japan Week is held in April and celebrates the sister-city relationship with Nishinomiya, Hyogo, demonstrating the many commonalities shared between the two cities. Students from the Spokane campus of Mukogawa Fort Wright Institute, Gonzaga, Whitworth, and other area schools organize an array of Japanese cultural events. The gay and lesbian Spokane Pride Parade is held each June. There is an annual Renaissance fair and Civil War reenactment as well.

==Government and politics==

The City of Spokane operates under a mayor–council form of government, with executive and legislative branches that are elected in non-partisan elections. David Condon was elected mayor in November 2011 and took office on the last business day of the year. The previous mayor was Mary Verner, who succeeded Dennis P. Hession who himself succeeded the recalled James &quot;Jim&quot; West. The city elected James Everett Chase as its first African-American mayor in 1981, and after his retirement, elected the city&#x27;s first woman mayor, Vicki McNeil. Spokane is the county seat of Spokane County, a position it wrested from Cheney in 1886. Spokane is a part of Washington&#x27;s 3rd legislative district, which is represented in the Washington State Senate by Andy Billig. The 3rd Legislative District is represented in the Washington House of Representatives by Marcus Riccelli and Timm Ormsby.

Federally, Spokane is within Washington&#x27;s 5th congressional district, and has been represented in the House of Representatives by Republican Michael Baumgartner since 2025. Washington State is represented nationally in the Senate by Democrat Patty Murray and Democrat Maria Cantwell. In the 2012 general election, Spokane County favored Mitt Romney for president over Barack Obama by 51.5 to 45.7 percent; on the state ballot, the county supported the legalization of recreational marijuana ballot measure by 52.2 to 47.9 percent but opposed the legalization of same-sex marriage by 55.9 to 44.1 percent. Spokane native Tom Foley was a Democratic Speaker of the House and served as a representative of Washington&#x27;s 5th district for 30 years, enjoying large support from Spokane, until his narrow defeat in the &quot;Republican Revolution&quot; of 1994, the only time U.S. voters have turned out a sitting Speaker of the House since 1860.

===Crime===

The crime rate per 1,000 people in the Spokane metropolitan area (Spokane County) was 64.8 in 2012, higher than the Washington state average of 38.3; the violent crime rate of 3.8 and property crime rate of 61 also exceed the statewide averages of 2.5 and 35.8, respectively. NeighborhoodScout describes Spokane as &quot;Safer than 2% of U.S. Cities&quot;.

Half of all property crimes are localized in about 6.5 percent of the city. Spokane had the fourth-highest rate of auto theft in the U.S. in 2010 and 2011, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau. Drive-by shootings and drug use, particularly crack cocaine use, became worse in the early 1990s, and four drive-by shootings were recorded in December 1993 alone. In the 1990s, the Spokane Police Department (SPD) established a special gang unit, with an officer &quot;collecting intelligence on gang activity and disseminating it to street officers&quot;. The 1990s also saw Spokane&#x27;s most prolific serial killer, Robert Lee Yates, who killed thirteen prostitutes in Spokane&#x27;s East Sprague red light district and confessed to two others in Tacoma, Washington. The transition of the Spokane Police Department to a community-policing precinct model has helped curb crime rates since its introduction downtown, and has been expanded citywide. The crime woes are possibly due in part to an imbalance that Spokane County prisons receive of pre-release and work-release prisoners; An investigation by the &quot;Tacoma News Tribune&quot; found that while Spokane County accounts for 6.21 percent of the inmates in state prisons, it receives a disproportionate 16.73 percent of the inmate population to be released into the general population.

Spokane and the Spokane Police Department have received national publicity and scrutiny in the 2000s and 2010s due to many officer-involved shootings and allegations of excessive force. The most high-profile of these incidents was the 2006 death of Otto Zehm, a mentally challenged man who was initially suspected of theft at a convenience store. Zehm was later found to have committed no crime, but was struck with batons by several officers and tasered. The increased pressure on the SPD prompted an independent review by a commission of the organization&#x27;s use-of-force policies, an internal culture audit, and the purchase of body cameras.

=== Housing ===
Restrictive zoning regulations were implemented in Spokane in the middle of the 20th century. These zoning regulations were frequently motivated by a desire to keep lower-income families out of certain neighborhoods, in particular racial minorities.

In 2022, Spokane relaxed its zoning regulations to permit on an interim basis duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes and townhomes in all residential zones of Spokane. In 2023, Spokane permanently permitted up to six housing units to be built on any lot in a residential area, as well as allow nonresidential businesses (such as grocery stores) and facilities (such as schools and churches) in residential areas.

==Education==

===Public and private schools===
Spokane Public Schools (District 81) was organized in 1889, and is the largest public school system in Spokane, and the second-largest in the state, as of 2014, serving roughly 30,000 students in six high schools, six middle schools, and thirty-four elementary schools. Other public school districts in the Spokane area include the Mead School District in north Spokane County, outside city limits. A variety of state-approved, independent charter schools and private and parochial elementary and secondary schools augment the public school system. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Spokane manages ten such schools in &amp; around the area.

===Higher education===

Spokane is home to many higher education institutions. They include the private universities Gonzaga and Whitworth, and the public Community Colleges of Spokane system (Spokane Community College and Spokane Falls Community College) as well as a variety of technical institutes. Gonzaga University and Law School were founded by the Italian-born priest Joseph Cataldo and the Jesuits in 1887. Whitworth was founded in Tacoma, Washington in 1890 and moved to its present location in 1914. It is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church and had 2,500 students studying in 53 different undergraduate and degree programs as of 2011. While Spokane is one of the larger cities in the U.S. to lack a main campus of a state-supported university within its city limits, Eastern Washington University (EWU) and Washington State University (WSU) have operations at the Riverpoint Campus in the University District, just adjacent to downtown and across the Spokane River from the Gonzaga campus. Washington State University Spokane is WSU&#x27;s health sciences campus and houses the school&#x27;s College of Nursing, College of Pharmacy, and Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine. The main EWU campus is located southwest of Spokane in nearby Cheney, and WSU is located to the south in Pullman. In addition to WSU&#x27;s health science presence in Spokane, there is also a four-year medical school branch affiliated with the University of Washington&#x27;s WWAMI program. An international branch campus of the Mukogawa Women&#x27;s University, the Mukogawa Fort Wright Institute, is located in Spokane.

=== Libraries ===
Serving the general educational needs of the local population are two public library districts, the Spokane Public Library (within city limits) and the Spokane County Library District. Founded in 1904 with funding from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, the Spokane Public Library system comprises a downtown library overlooking the Spokane Falls and five branch libraries. Special collections focus on Inland Pacific Northwest history and include reference books, periodicals, maps, photographs, and other archival materials and government documents.

==Sports==

Spokane is close to dozens of lakes and rivers for outdoor sports and recreation. People use these for swimming, boating, kayaking, rafting, and fishing. Nearby mountains provide for skiing, hiking, biking and sightseeing.
The Spokane region&#x27;s professional and semi-professional sports teams include the Spokane Indians in Minor League Baseball and the Spokane Chiefs in junior ice hockey. Collegiate sports in Spokane focus on the local teams such as the Gonzaga Bulldogs who compete in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I West Coast Conference and the Whitworth Pirates playing in the Division III Northwest Conference and local media covers other regional teams, including the Eastern Washington Eagles, Washington State Cougars, and the Idaho Vandals.

===Baseball===
The Spokane Indians located in the suburb Spokane Valley, are a Class High-A baseball team in the Northwest League (NWL) and have been a farm team of the Colorado Rockies since 2021. The Indians play their home games at the 6,803-seat Avista Stadium and have won seven NWL titles since their Short-Season-A debut in 1982. Prior to 1982, the Indians played at the Triple-A level. The team achieved considerable success in the early 1970s, winning the Pacific Coast League championship in 1970, and having a 94–52 record. In the 1920s and 1930s the Spokane City League, a semiprofessional baseball league of teams of the Inland Empire, reached its peak.

===Hockey===
The Spokane Chiefs are a junior ice hockey team that play in the Canadian Hockey League&#x27;s Western Hockey League. They play their home games in the Spokane Arena and have a regional rivalry with the Tri-City Americans. They have won the CHL&#x27;s top prize, the Memorial Cup, two times in club history, first in 1991 and again in 2008.

===Soccer===
Spokane is host to United Soccer League professional men&#x27;s USL League One (Spokane Velocity FC), a women&#x27;s pre-professional USL W League team, as well as a women&#x27;s professional USL Super League team (Spokane Zephyr FC). They play their home games in ONE Spokane Stadium.

===Major events===
The Spokane Arena is the city&#x27;s premier sports venue. In the years since the Spokane Arena opened, it has played host to several major sporting events. The first major event was the 1998 Memorial Cup, the championship game of the Canadian Hockey League. Four years later in 2002, the city hosted the 2002 Skate America figure skating competition and then the 2007 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in the Spokane Arena. The latter event set an attendance record, selling nearly 155,000 tickets. Spokane later hosted the 2010 U.S. Figure Skating Championships – ending eighteen days before the start of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia and then the 2016 Team Challenge Cup. Spokane is also home to The Podium indoor hydraulic track and event space, and multi-use One Spokane Stadium.

==Media==

===Print===
Newspaper service in Spokane is provided by its only major daily newspaper, &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot;, which has a daily circulation of 76,291 and Sunday circulation of 95,939. &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot; was formed from the merger of the &quot;Spokane Falls Review&quot; (1883–1894) and the &quot;Spokesman&quot; (1890–1893) in 1893 and was first published under the present name on June 29, 1894. It later absorbed the competing afternoon paper &quot;The Spokane Daily Chronicle&quot;, a significant newspaper that existed from 1881 until 1982 and returned in 2021. More specialized publications include the weekly alternative newspaper &quot;Inlander&quot;, the bi-weekly &quot;Spokane Journal of Business&quot;, and the student-run &quot;Gonzaga Bulletin&quot;. Monthly publications include &quot;The Black Lens&quot;, an African American community newspaper, a newspaper for parents, &quot;Kids Newspaper&quot;, and a home and lifestyle magazine, &quot;Spokane Coeur d&#x27;Alene Living&quot;.

===Radio===
According to Arbitron, Spokane is the 94th-largest radio market in the U.S., with 532,100 listeners aged 12 and over. There are 28 AM and FM radio stations broadcast in the city. The five most listened-to stations are KKZX-FM (classic rock), KQNT-AM (news/talk), KXLY-FM (country), KISC-FM (adult contemporary),KZBD-FM (Contemporary Hit Radio), and KZZU-FM (Hot AC). Spokane&#x27;s primary sources of non-commercial and community radio include Spokane&#x27;s NPR-affiliate station KPBX-FM and KYRS, a full-power community radio station.

===Television===
Spokane is the 73rd-largest television market in the U.S., accounting for 0.366% of the total TV households in the U.S. The city has six television stations, representing the major commercial networks and public television. Spokane is the television broadcast center for much of eastern Washington (except the Yakima and Tri-Cities area), northern Idaho, northwestern Montana, northeastern Oregon, and parts of southern Canada (by cable television). Spokane receives broadcasts in the Pacific Time Zone, with weekday prime time beginning at 8 pm. Montana and Alberta, Canada are in the Mountain Time Zone and receive Spokane broadcasts one hour later by their local time. The major network television affiliates include KREM (TV) 2 (CBS), KXLY-TV 4 (ABC), KHQ-TV 6 (NBC; Spokane&#x27;s first television station, on air on December 20, 1952), KAYU 28 (FOX), KSKN 22 (The CW), KSPS-TV 7 (PBS), and KCDT-TV 26 (PBS; operating out of Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho).

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

====City streets====
Spokane&#x27;s streets use a grid plan that is oriented to the four cardinal directions; generally, the east–west roads are designated as avenues, and the north–south roads are referred to as streets. Major east–west thoroughfares in the city include Francis, Wellesley, Mission, Sprague, and 29th Avenues. Major north–south thoroughfares include Maple–Ash, Monroe, Division, Hamilton, Greene–Market (north of I-90), and Ray–Freya (south of I-90) Streets. Division Street divides the city into East and West, while Sprague Avenue splits the city into North and South. Division Street is Spokane&#x27;s major retail corridor; Sprague Avenue serves the same purpose in Spokane Valley. With over 40,000 vehicles per day in average daily traffic from Interstate 90 north to the US 2–US 395 junction, North Division is Spokane&#x27;s busiest corridor.

Spokane&#x27;s extensive skywalk system covers thirteen blocks in the downtown area and is among the largest in the United States; it is used for pedestrian travel in cold and inclement weather and retail space as well. Despite this, the city has an average Walk Score of 49 as of 2020, indicating that most errands require a car. Its average Bike Score is 52.
====Mass transportation====

Before the influx of automobiles, Spokane&#x27;s electric streetcar and interurban lines played a dominant role in moving people and goods around Spokane. Streetcars were installed as early as 1888, when they were pulled by horses. Many older side streets in Spokane still have visible streetcar rails embedded in them. Streetcar service was reduced due to declining ridership beginning in 1922, and by August 1936, all lines had been abandoned or converted to motor buses.

Spokane has intercity rail and bus service provided by Amtrak, Greyhound, Flixbus and Jefferson Lines via the Spokane Intermodal Center. The city is a stop for Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Empire Builder&quot; on its way to and from Chicago&#x27;s Union Station en route to Seattle and Portland. Amtrak&#x27;s through service to Seattle and Portland is a legacy of BNSF Railway&#x27;s old Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway trackage. Spokane is a major railway junction for the BNSF Railway and the Union Pacific Railroad and is the western terminus for the Montana Rail Link.

Public transportation throughout the Spokane area is provided by the Spokane Transit Authority (STA), which operates a fleet of 164 buses. Its service area covers roughly and reaches 85 percent of the county&#x27;s population. The STA Plaza in downtown Spokane acts as the regional hub for most STA routes. As a part of the system&#x27;s high performance transit network plan, STA introduced Eastern Washington&#x27;s first bus rapid transit (BRT) route, City Line, in July 2023. STA is also planning a Division Street BRT.

====Freeways and highways====
Interstate 90 (I-90) runs east–west from Seattle, through downtown Spokane, and eastward through Spokane Valley, Liberty Lake, and onward to Coeur d&#x27;Alene and then Missoula. Although they are not limited access highways like I-90, US 2 and US 395 enter Spokane from the west via I-90 and continue north through Spokane via Division Street. The two highways share the same route until they reach &quot;The Y&quot;, a fork where US 395 continues northward to Deer Park, Colville then onward to Canada, and US 2 branches off to the northeast, continuing to Mead, Newport, and Sandpoint. US 195, also known as the Inland Empire Highway, connects to Interstate 90 west of Spokane near Latah Creek and travels south through the Palouse.

The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) is tasked with improving local highways to keep up with the region&#x27;s growth and to try to prevent congestion problems that plague many larger cities. The WSDOT is constructing the North Spokane Corridor. When completed, the corridor will be a limited-access highway that will run from I-90, in the vicinity of the Thor/Freya interchange, northward through Spokane, meeting the existing US 395 just south of the Wandermere Golf Course.

====Airports====
Spokane International Airport (IATA: GEG, ICAO: KGEG) serves as the primary commercial airport for Spokane, Eastern Washington, and Northern Idaho. It is the second-largest airport in the state of Washington, and is recognized by the Federal Aviation Administration as a small hub, with service from nine passenger and five cargo airlines. The airport is located west of downtown Spokane and is approximately a 10-minute drive away. The international airport&#x27;s three-letter designation is &quot;GEG&quot;, a result and legacy of the Geiger Field days prior to 1960, when the airport was named after Army aviator Major Harold Geiger in 1941.

Felts Field is a general aviation airport serving the Spokane area and is located in east Spokane along the south bank of the Spokane River. Aviation at Felts Field dates back to 1913 and the strip served as Spokane&#x27;s primary airport until commercial air traffic was redirected to Geiger Field after World War II. In 1927, the strip was one of the first in the western U.S. to receive official recognition as an airport by the U.S. Department of Commerce and is now named in honor of James Buell Felts, a Washington Air National Guard pilot.

===Healthcare===

The Spokane area has six major hospitals, four of which are full-service facilities. The health-care industry is a large and increasingly important industry in Spokane; the city provides specialized care to many patients from the surrounding Inland Northwest and as far north as the Canada–US border. The city&#x27;s health-care needs are served primarily by non-profit Seattle-based Providence Health &amp; Services and non-profit Tacoma-based Multicare Health System, which run the two biggest hospitals, Sacred Heart Medical Center, and Deaconess Hospital, respectively. These two hospitals, the 102-bed St. Luke&#x27;s Rehabilitation Institute, 100-bed Inland Northwest Behavioral Health, and most of Spokane&#x27;s major health-care facilities, are located on Spokane&#x27;s Lower-South Hill, just south of downtown, in what is known as the &quot;Medical District&quot; of Spokane. Sacred Heart Hospital opened originally with just 31 beds on Spokane Falls Boulevard on January 27, 1887, but later moved to its present location at 101 West Eighth Avenue. As of 2014 it had 642 beds, with 28,319 admissions, 71,543 emergency room visits, and 2,982 births annually, and a full-time staff of 29 doctors and dentists and 583 registered nurses. Deaconess Medical Center, the smaller of the two main hospitals, had 388 beds as of 2014. Other hospitals in the area include the Spokane Veterans Affairs Medical Center in the northwest part of town, Providence Holy Family Hospital on the north side, and MultiCare Valley Hospital in the Spokane Valley. One of 20 specialty orthopedic Shriners Hospitals in the U.S. is also located in Spokane. One of Washington&#x27;s two state psychiatric hospitals, Eastern State Hospital, is located away in Medical Lake.

===Utilities===
The City of Spokane provides municipal water, wastewater management, and solid waste management. Spokane operates Washington&#x27;s only waste-to-energy plant as well as two solid waste transfer stations as part of the Spokane Regional Solid Waste System, a collaboration between the City of Spokane and Spokane County. Electricity generated by the waste-to-energy plant is used to operate the facility, with excess energy being sold to Puget Sound Energy. Spokane draws its water from the Spokane Valley–Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer; this &quot;sole source aquifer&quot; is the only water supply for Spokane County in Washington, and for Kootenai and Bonner counties in Idaho. Serving over 500,000 people, the aquifer is distinguished in being one of the largest aquifers in the country at 10 trillion gallons, as well as having one of the fastest flow rates in the country at per day, and for its purity.

Natural gas and electricity are provided by the local utility, Avista Utilities, while CenturyLink and Comcast provide television, internet, and telephone service. Spokane hosts three hydroelectric generation facilities on the Spokane River: the Upriver Dam, the Upper Falls Dam, and the Monroe Street Dam. The Upriver Dam is owned and operated by the City of Spokane, and generates the electricity needed to operate the municipal water supply&#x27;s pressure pumps. The power generated in excess of that is sold to Avista Utilities. The Upper Falls and Monroe Street dams are owned and operated by Avista Utilities, and have respective generation capacities of 10 and 15 MW.

==Notes==

The name is said to derive from &quot;Spukcane&quot;, the vocalization of a sound made by a snake which the Chief of the Spokanes came to call &quot;power from the brain&quot; after pondering it made his head vibrate. It is unknown when the present meaning of the word, &quot;Sun People&quot; replaced this earlier meaning.
Unbeknownst to them, the Spokane Valley was the only area within 200 miles that could provide passage to the Inland Empire through the Rockies at a reasonable grade.
The present name, set forth by an 1891 charter reincorporated the city under the name &quot;Spokane Falls&quot;, stating: &quot;&quot;The corporate name of the city is Spokane Falls, and by that name shall have perpetual succession&quot; (Charter, Article I).&quot; However, a later article in that same charter which was voted on concurrently changed the name to &quot;Spokane&quot;.
Secretary of the Spokane chamber of commerce, John R. Reavis tells of Spokane&#x27;s significance to the Inland Northwest region as an distributing center (largely the city&#x27;s ) in his 1891 Annual Report, writing: &quot;By reason of her geographical position and railroad connections Spokane is fitted as no other city is, or ever can be, to be the distributing center of all that country within a radius of 150 miles, and in some instances territory much farther away. There is no point 150 miles from Spokane that is not at least 225 miles from any other city of 10,000 population. We have about us a territory of 60,000 square miles in extent, to every point of which we are nearer than any other city, to every point of which we have better railroad connections and easier grades than any other city ... We have eight lines of railroad that radiate out in all directions through it, so that shipments made here in the morning can reach any point within its borders by nightfall. We have a telephone system connecting us with almost every shipping town and shipping station within its borders. Goods may be ordered, shipped and received, in most instances, within one day. Never was a city more intimately knit to its surrounding territory than Spokane, and never was one more free from a legitimate rival in trade ...&quot;

The financing for rebuilding the downtown core came in large part from the infusion of investment from Dutch bankers; this investment was so deep that by 1896, one prominent Dutch mortgage company, the &quot;Northwestern and Pacific Hypotheekbank&quot; owned a quarter of the city.
In 1892, the Interstate Commerce Commission agreed with the city after it filed a complaint about these practices, but that decision was struck down by a federal court. In 1906, Spokane sued under the newly passed Hepburn Act, and won on July 24, 1911.

<text>Town and Country (often referred to locally as &#x27;Lynwood&#x27;) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Spokane County, Washington, United States. The population was 5,068 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land.

The city of Spokane surrounds the CDP on three sides: the east, south and west. The city&#x27;s street grid continues into Town and Country uninterrupted in the east, though it breaks down in the west along the bluff leading up to Five Mile Prairie. The bulk of the CDP lies on flat ground like the surrounding north side of Spokane. Along the west, however, the terrain rises rapidly from Town and Country&#x27;s elevation of roughly 2,000 feet to over 2,300 at the crest over less than 1,000 feet of distance in places.

As is the case with the city of Spokane to the east and south, Town and Country blends into its neighbor to the north, the CDP of Country Homes, Washington, seamlessly.

Francis Avenue, carrying Washington State Route 291, serves as Town and Country&#x27;s southern border, beyond which lies the North Hill neighborhood. Cedar Road is the western border, beginning on the flatland and then climbing the bluff towards the crest and into Five Mile Prairie. Most of the northern border with Country Homes runs along Country Homes Boulevard. Division Street, carrying U.S. Route 2 was the eastern border until 2008, when the city of Spokane annexed some of Town and Country. Division is still the eastern border from Country Homes Boulevard south to Lincoln Road. South of Lincoln the border works its way around the Holy Cross Cemetery, which used to be part of Country Homes, before following Atlantic Street, which runs parallel to and one block to the west of Division, for the four southernmost blocks of the CDP.

Most of Town and Country is zoned as low density residential, but there are commercial zones along Francis Avenue in the south and Division Street on the east.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2020, there were 5,068 people and 2,109 households residing in the CDP, with an average of 2.56 persons per household. The population density was 4,223.3 people per square mile. The racial makeup of the CDP was 89.2% White, 1.3% African American, 0.1% Native American, 1.3% Asian, 0.0% Pacific Islander, and 7.4% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 6.9% of the population.

In the CDP, the age distribution of the population showed 25.2% under the age of 18 and 16.1% who were 65 years of age or older. Females made up 51.4% of the population. Of those age 16 and above, 66.7% were in the workforce, with 57.3% of females age 16+ in the workforce.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $66,911. The per capita income for the CDP was $28,608. 9.2% of the population were below the poverty line. Median value of owner-occupied homes was $212,300, with 75.0% of homes being owner-occupied. Median rent in the CDP was $1,143.

==Education==
Town and Country is split between two school districts, with Spokane Public Schools serving the southern half of the CDP and the Mead School District serving the north. Linwood Elementary, part of Spokane Public Schools, is located in Town and Country. It feeds into Salk Middle School and then into Shadle Park High School. Evergreen Elementary, part of the Mead School District, is also located in Town and Country. It feeds into Highland Middle School and then into Mead High School.

==Transportation==
===Highway===

* - U.S. 2 - to Newport (north) and Spokane (south)

U.S. 2 passes north–south along the eastern boundary of Town and Country on Division Street.

* - U.S. 395 - to Colville (north) and Spokane (south)

U.S. 395 passes north–south along the eastern boundary of Town and Country along Division Street.

* - State Route 291 - to Tumtum (north) and Spokane (south)

State Route 291 passes along the southern boundary of Town and Country on Francis Avenue.

===Surface streets===
The three highways serving Town and Country all travel along surface streets and none are classified as limited-access in the area. Francis Avenue and Division Street are classified by the city of Spokane as major arterials, the city&#x27;s highest classification for a surface street. While the city does not classify streets that lie entirely within Town and Country, it does consider the streets which connect to and serve as extensions of Country Homes Boulevard once it passes into the city limits to be major arterials as well. Country Homes Boulevard links the Maple/Ash couplet in the southwest with Division Street at a major intersection known as &quot;the Y&quot; in the northeast, making it a major thoroughfare in the neighborhood. It carried 26,400 vehicles per day in 2018, making Country Homes Boulevard one of unincorporated Spokane County&#x27;s busiest roadways.

Dedicated bike lanes run on Wall Street, Country Homes Boulevard and Lincoln Road, and Cedar Road is classified as a shared roadway bike route.

===Public transit===
Town and Country is served by the Spokane area&#x27;s public transit provider, the Spokane Transit Authority, which runs four fixed-route bus lines through the CDP. The Country Homes Park &amp; Ride is located across the street to the north of the CDP and the Five Mile Park &amp; Ride is one block to the south of the CDP.

<text>Waverly is a town in Spokane County, Washington, United States. The population was 121 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Waverly was settled by white immigrants as early as 1878, and was named by two settlers after Waverly, Iowa in 1879. The following year the community received a post office at the residence of A.D. Thayer on Hangman Creek (now Latah Creek), where it remained for five years.

In 1884 P. Gimble opened the town&#x27;s first business, a general store, which was followed by a station for a new branch of the Oregon Railroad &amp; Navigation Company, and warehouses built by the Spokane Grain &amp; Milling Company and the Pacific Coast Elevator Company.

In December 1899 a beet sugar factory built by the Washington State Beet Sugar Company opened. It cost $500,000 to build, included a farm, and could process per day. It was considered unprofitable and inferior. Thomas R. Cutler and the Utah Sugar Company advised the factory, based on their success with the Lehi, Utah factory. The factory closed in 1910 and eventually sold to the Gunnison Sugar Company for $100,000. The equipment was installed in Centerfield, Utah in 1917. The beet sugar company employed 150 workers in the factory, and up to 400 workers in the beet fields during harvest time. Additionally, the town included a hardware store, jewelry store, harness shop, meat market, millinery, two hotels, two restaurants, a livery stable, barber shop, furniture store, and two saloons. Waverly was officially incorporated on May 15, 1907.

<doc id="138274" wikidata="Q1515809" url="?curid=138274" title="Chewelah, Washington">
<text>Chewelah ( ) is a city in Stevens County, Washington, United States. It is located approximately northwest of Spokane. The population was 2,470 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The name of the town comes from a Kalispel word, , meaning &#x27;watersnake&#x27; or &#x27;gartersnake&#x27;. Prior to colonization by European-Americans, Chewelah was home to a band of the Kalispel people. The band was known as the &quot;slet̓éw̓si&quot;, meaning &quot;valley people&quot;. Originally, the area was called Fool&#x27;s Prairie, after the indigenous Kalispel who left his own tribe because of a dispute. Chewelah and the rest of the Colville River Valley were part of the Colville Indian Reservation from April 9, 1872, when the reservation was created, until July 2, 1872, when a subsequent executive order reduced the size of the reservation. The Chewelah Band of Indians is currently part of the Spokane Tribe.

Thomas and Mary Brown moved to the Fool&#x27;s Prairie in 1859. On May 8, 1872, Thomas Brown received authority to establish a post office called Chewelah. The name was first used in Stevens County Commissioner Journals on May 6, 1872. That post office disbanded on February 23, 1875. In 1879, the post office was reestablished with Major John Simms, Indian Agent, as postmaster. Chewelah was officially incorporated on January 26, 1903.

Chewelah is a town of firsts in Stevens County. It had the first Protestant Congregational Church in 1891, the first school in 1869, the Spokane Falls and Northern Railway arrived in 1889, a Catholic church was established in 1885, and the first county newspaper was founded in July 1885.

Initially, Chewelah was a pioneer settlement, being an agricultural center that can be traced back to the early 1870s and having prospectors working the adjacent countryside as early as 1842. The town was platted in 1884 and became known for being a rough and tumble mining town; the first lead and silver mines were established around 1886, and others followed in Embry and surrounding areas.

The town&#x27;s newspaper, The Independent, was founded by William Hunter Brownlow (1860–1946) in 1903 and has been in publication ever since. The first issue came off the press on June 19, 1903, with the help of his four sons—Truman, Ralph, Arthur, and Alex—Brownlow. The family produced a weekly eight-page newspaper.

By 1905 the population had reached 650, and within a few years many prosperous copper, silver, lead, and some gold mines were flourishing in the area. The most successful ore mined in Chewelah was magnesite. By 1916 Chewelah&#x27;s plant was said to be the largest producer of magnesite in the country, and at full production was the largest producer in the world, shipping some 700 tons daily. During the war, there were as many as 800 people working at the plant making high temperature-resistant refractory brick.

By 1920 Chewelah&#x27;s population had grown to 1,600 people and continued to prosper until the late 1960s. In 1968, the magnesite plant closed down due to cheaper competition from Japan and changes in the steel industry. Despite this major change, Chewelah survived the transition from being a &quot;one-company town&quot;, and today Chewelah has several thousand residents and displays a pleasant blend of the past and future. With its moderate climate, dry land, and irrigated farming, ranching and dairy farming continue to be mainstays. Chewelah&#x27;s diversified economy also includes a ski area and golf course, among other industries.

In June 2019, the Chewelah Creative District became the second state-designated creative district in the state, following a similar designation for Edmonds.

<text>Colville is a city in Stevens County, Washington, United States. The population was 4,917 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Stevens County.

==History==
John Work, an agent for The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, established Fort Colvile near the Kettle Falls fur trading site in 1825. It replaced the Spokane House and the Flathead Post as the main trading center on the Upper Columbia River. The area was named for Andrew Colvile, a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company governor. The fort continued to be used for some time as a center of mining and transportation/supply support associated with gold rushes in the 1850s, particularly the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. After it was abandoned in 1870, some buildings stood until as late as 1910. The site was flooded by Lake Roosevelt after construction of the Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River.

Americans also wanted to operate in this territory. In the first half of the 19th century, the Oregon boundary dispute (or Oregon question) arose as a result of competing British and American claims to the Pacific Northwest. It was settled by the Oregon Treaty of 1846, which set the new boundary between Canada and the United States at the 49th Parallel, about Forty (40) miles to the north.

In 1859, the U.S. Army established a new Fort Colville at Pinkney City, Washington, about 3 miles NE of the current city of Colville. That fort was abandoned in 1882. In late 1871, with the resolution of Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company land claims, Governor Edward Selig Salomon directed John Wynne to accept those lands which extended south to Orin-Rice Road, including some currently part of the City of Colville. With the planned closure of Fort Colville, businesses and buildings moved to the present location in the Colville River Valley prior to 1882. In January 1883, W. F. Hooker filed the first plat in Stevens County with the name &quot;Belmont&quot; or &quot;Bellmond&quot;. He was encouraged to change the plat name to Colville so that the county seat could be moved to this location. On December 28, 1883, the Stevens County Board of County Commissioners, including county commissioner John U. Hofstetter, held a special session regarding the removal of county records to Belmont from the county seat of Colville, formerly called Pinkney City. In that meeting, commissioners allowed moving the county seat and jail to the town with the name of Colville, if proprietors provided a block of land for them without cost. County officers were allowed to move into a building owned by John U. Hofstetter for two years. On January 1, 1884, the Stevens County courthouse moved to Colville. City tradition says that Colville was founded by John U. Hofstetter. It was officially incorporated as a city on June 7, 1890.

In the 1950s, the Colville Air Force Station was developed and operated 14.7 miles north and east of Colville as part of the Air Defense Command&#x27;s network of radar stations. A few buildings remain at the site today. It is used largely by paint-ballers.

<text>Marcus is a town in Stevens County, Washington, United States. The population was 216 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Marcus was named for Marcus Oppenheimer who settled in the area in 1863.

Marcus was a supply and transportation base for northward-bound travellers during the Big Bend Gold Rush of the 1860s in the Colony of British Columbia due to its location just above Kettle Falls, a wall to river navigation. In 1865 the steamboat &quot;Forty-Nine&quot; was built at Marcus to attempt the run to the goldrush boomtown of La Porte at the foot of the infamous Dalles des Morts or &quot;Death Rapids&quot;, which were located in the immediate vicinity of the rush and were the upper barrier to river navigation. Regular service from Marcus to La Porte did not begin until 1866 due to difficult winter conditions at the Narrows of the Arrow Lakes on the first attempt in 1865.

Marcus was officially incorporated on October 18, 1910. The original townsite was submerged beneath the waters of Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake when Grand Coulee Dam was built.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.

===Climate===
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters.

<text>Northport is a town in Stevens County, Washington, United States. The population was 297 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Northport began when railroad builder Daniel C. Corbin had agents purchase two wooded benches overlooking the Columbia River from the federal government in 1892. Corbin had plans to extend his Spokane Falls and Northern Railway (S&amp;FN) from Little Dalles, the town seven miles south, to the rich mining districts of southern British Columbia. Northport would provide a railhead for two railroads into Canada.

At this time, &quot;The Kootenai Steamship Company&quot; riverboats provided service from Little Dalles to Revelstoke, B.C. After the S&amp;FN reached Northport on Sept. 18, 1892, the riverboats ran from Northport to Revelstoke.

Northport became an international port of entry in 1895.

In March 1896 a major fire occurred in the business district. At least 16 businesses were destroyed or damaged.

The north half of the Colville Indian Reservation, across the river from Northport, was opened to mining in February 1896. Miners and prospectors flooded into the area and came into town to record their claims, get supplies and entertain themselves.

In 1890, ores rich in copper, gold and silver were discovered in Canada at Red Mountain, near the present city of Rossland, British Columbia. Mines were developed and the ore was laboriously shipped out by wagon on a rude road 17 miles (27.4 km) and ferried across the Columbia river to Northport and the S&amp;FN. In January 1896, 174 horse teams hauled ore down the road in one week. The need for rail transportation was great and D.C. Corbin set about obtaining approvals and charters to fill the need. Construction began on the American side in May 1896. A ferry was built at Northport to carry engines and cars across the Columbia River until a bridge could be built. &quot;The Columbia and Red Mountain&quot; railroad began service in December. The bridge over the Columbia River was begun in early spring 1897 and completed in October. Northport was now a busy railway center boasting a two-story 180-foot (54.9-meter) long passenger depot, the connection point of three railroads linking the supply center of Spokane to the mining districts of British Columbia.

The Red Mountain mines were now producing more ore than the smelter at Trail British Columbia could process. The mine owners, mostly Americans, wanted another smelter. Northport had limestone and rail connections for importing coke, coal and building materials and exporting the smelter matte to distant refineries. D.C. Corbin donated the land on a bench overlooking the river north of town and construction began in August 1897. The smelter began operations in January 1898. Two hundred men were employed which soon increased to almost six hundred.

On May 3, 1898, another major fire reduced to ashes the entire business district and the red light district, more than three city blocks. The city was quickly rebuilt.

On June 23, 1898, an election was held to incorporate an area of the county with 1,500 inhabitants as the &quot;City of Northport&quot;, and to elect a mayor and city council. Incorporation passed 228 for, 5 against. Now, instead of the county collecting over $5,000 in local saloon fees, the new town could afford to improve the streets, build sidewalks, have a health officer, a fire department, a marshall and a jail.

The US immigration inspector was located at Northport in 1900.

At this time, the city was financed without property taxes but by licensing saloons, and by fines levied on gambling and courtesans.

In these first years, the smelter mostly treated the copper and gold ores from the LeRoi mine near Rossland, B.C., but in 1906 the LeRoi contracted the Trail, B.C. smelter to treat its ores and the Northport smelter gradually ceased operations, shipping the last matte in May 1911.

After the smelter was idled, things looked bleak for Northport. Times were hard, the population fell to 300, many businesses closed and the Northport State Bank became insolvent, unable to pay its depositors.

On July 22, 1914, Northport suffered another major fire. Blocks 3 and 4 were destroyed. This included most of the business district, a warehouse and the Great Northern train depot. Only a few businesses rebuilt and the once densely packed block 4 has remained mostly vacant ever since.

Then, in September 1915, the Northport Smelting and Refining Co. was purchased by the Hercules Mining Co. and the Tamarack and Custer Consolidated Mining Co. The smelter was renovated to treat lead ores, and began operations March 12, 1916.

At the end of the world war, demand for lead fell and unfavorable freight rates led the Northport smelter to close in 1921. The plant was sold to the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO) in August 1922. ASARCO dismantled the works and the boom days were over.

In 1925, in addition to the general depressed business conditions locally, the smelter at Trail, British Columbia, 20 miles (32.2 km) up the river valley, doubled sulfur emissions. The toxic smoke drifted down the river valley to the United States. Trees died, crops withered and cattle sickened. A meeting of the local farmers led to the formation of a Citizens Protective Association and helped bring the situation to the attention of members of congress. The US State Department opened negotiations with Canada and the matter was referred to The International Joint Commission. It was the first case of air pollution to come before an international tribunal. Negotiations dragged on for years. In 1934 President Roosevelt pressed the case, leading to more studies and a Final Decision was arrived at on Mar 11, 1941 in which $438,000 was paid to compensate the farmers. Individual farmers who had made claims received an amount that was only a small fraction of their losses.

The Tribunal declared that &quot;no state has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein, when the case is of serious consequence&quot;. The Trail Smelter case became &quot;one of the most cited and fundamental cases for international environmental law&quot;.

Northport was given its name since it was once the northernmost town on the S&amp;FN.

==Geography==

The hottest temperature measured in Northport is during the 2021 Western North America heat wave in June. The coldest reading is from January 1909. The coldest daily maximum in Northport were two separate measurements, in 1902 and 1968. During the 1991–2020 set of normals, the average coldest maximum was relatively close to the normals at . Ice days are common in winter, with normals just below freezing.

==Janni&#x27;s chimney==
Peter Janni was born in Italy in 1874 and came to America to work on the railroad. Eventually he ended up in Northport and in 1923 purchased a limestone quarry south of Northport. Janni shipped limestone all over Washington from the quarry. The quarry was located in the center of the tetrahedrite mineralized zone of Northern Stevens County. Ore deposits in the district occur in &quot;Vugs&quot; or &quot;Chimneys&quot; usually narrow veins of galena with high silver content. In 1953, Janni&#x27;s crew discovered a chimney of galena with silver, 6 feet by 5 feet (1.8 m by 1.5 m) on the second level of the quarry. They followed it down and shipped nearly forty tons of high grade galena to CM&amp;S Company&#x27;s lead refinery in nearby Trail. After following it down 15 feet (4.6 meters) Janni came and said: &quot;cover the damn thing up !&quot;. Janni&#x27;s men pleaded to follow the chimney further, but Janni refused, saying: &quot;maybe someday we will dig her up again&quot;. Why he abandoned the chimney remains a mystery. According to some old timers in Northport, the rich chimney is still at the quarry buried under tons of limestone, located on the second level.

<text>Springdale is a town in Stevens County, Washington, United States. The population was 234 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The present site of Springdale was a wilderness until about 1886, when Mr. John Shriner and Mr. Charles O. Squire arrived at about the same time. Squire erected the first sawmill in 1887. Once Mr. Squire finalized his homestead, he platted the area on November 29, 1889, which he called Squire City. He became the first postmaster in December 1889 and named the town &quot;Squires City.&quot;

Mark P. Sheffer was the first merchant. He brought in material by horse-drawn freight wagons prior to the arrival on the railroad.

In 1889, the Spokane Falls &amp; Northern Railway (SF&amp;N) was completed to the area and the depot was called Springdale. Springdale was the lunch stop between Spokane and Northport on the SF&amp;NRR. Sometime before 1892, residents petitioned to have the town&#x27;s name changed to &quot;Springdale.&quot; While the exact reason for this is unknown, the town is built over a series of subterranean streams, many of which emerge from the ground as springs. Springdale was officially incorporated on February 9, 1903.

The Springdale Reformer, started by Elmer Burrows, was published from 1907 to 1923.

The entire business section of Springdale was destroyed by fire, July 9, 1908.

<text>Bucoda () is a town in Thurston County, Washington, United States. The population was 600 at the 2020 census. The community refers to itself as the &quot;World&#x27;s Tiniest Town with the Biggest Halloween Spirit&quot;.

==Etymology==
The community was first known as Seatco, an indigenous word meaning evil spirit or devil; the town name became official in 1887 when the community was platted by an early founder, Oliver Shead (Shed). People in the town voiced a dislike of the name and the community was renamed Bucoda in 1890 by act of the state legislature. An accepted theory of the origination of the moniker of Bucoda comes from the taking of the first two letters of the last name of three prominent members of the early town, William Buckley (Buckner), a man recorded with the last name of Coulter, and J.E. Davis (David).

==History==
The first American settler at what is now Bucoda was Aaron Webster (1828–1911) who arrived in 1854. In the 1860s Webster sold his claim and sawmill to Oliver Shead. The Northern Pacific Railroad located a station at Seatco in 1872. A major flood affecting communities in the Skookumchuck and Chehalis river watersheds occurred in December 1887; two Chehalis residents lost their lives while near the town.
In the 1880s, investors began operations to mine coal in the area, but the coal was of poor quality and operations were sporadic. Beginning in 1874 or 1878, Bucoda was the site of Washington&#x27;s first territorial prison. A wooden, three-story structure, the jail garnered a reputation as a harsh institution as the inmates, some shackled for years, were used for dangerous and brutal manual labor in local industry. The prison was supposed to close in 1888 but was last used for inmates in 1890 and officially discontinued when the state opened the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla, Washington.

Bucoda was officially incorporated on June 7, 1910 and the first mayor was Emil Krupp. The town had a water tower that was scrapped in the early 1980s. The Mutual Lumber Mill was so productive the town was once billed as the &quot;Town with the Million Dollar Payroll&quot;. The mill burned down and was rebuilt only to have demand wane and once again it was consumed by flames.

A federal bill signed in January 2025 authorized the renaming of the town&#x27;s post office to the &quot;Mayor Rob Gordon Post Office&quot;. Gordon, who died of cancer the prior summer, had long been a resident and public servant in Bucoda, working in the fire department and on the town council.

<doc id="138281" wikidata="Q1515664" url="?curid=138281" title="Grand Mound, Washington">
<text>Grand Mound is a community and census-designated place (CDP) in Thurston County, Washington, United States. It was named and founded by Jotham Weeks Goodell, father of Phoebe Judson, in 1851. The population was 3,301 at the 2020 census. This area uses the 98579 and 98531 zip codes, which also includes Rochester and Gate.

==History==
Founded in 1851, stage service arrived in 1854. Known as Mound Prairie, the community built Fort Henness, which consisted of two blockhouses, during the mid-1800s amid fears over potential Native American attacks during the Puget Sound War; the fort never experienced combat. In 1913, the Washington State School for Girls (also known as the State Training School for Girls) was created and opened on in 1914. The school was renamed as Maple Lane School in 1959, and closed in 2011.

In the 1920s, strawberries became a major crop in the area, and a processing plant was built, but during the Great Depression the industry failed and the Northern Pacific Railway closed the Grand Mound station. By 1941 the population of the area had grown to about 200 people and the community had a post office along with a store and a single gas station. 

On November 6th, 1962, voters approved the formation of Thurston County Fire Protection District No. 14, which provided fire suppression, and later emergency medical services. The district began operations from the since abandoned gas station in 1963, later demolishing the aging building to construct a new fire station on the same site, which was completed in late 1971. In September of 1979, voters approved the issuance of a $120,000 facilities bond, which funded a new fire station to serve the Michigan Hill area, and the addition of 4 new bays to the main station in Grand Mound. In November of 2000, voters approved a $750,000 facilities bond to build a new station on land donated to the district by Thurston County, and to purchase a new water tender. In February of 2002, voters approved the merger of Fire District No. 14 into Fire District No. 1, forming Grand Mound - Rochester Fire Department. A new fire station was built to serve Grand Mound in 2007 with proceeds from a $3,500,000 facilities bond voters approved in May of 2006. In August of 2009, voters approved the consolidation of Thurston County Fire Protection District No. 11 into Grand Mound - Rochester Fire Department (Fire District No. 1), forming West Thurston Regional Fire Authority on January 1st, 2010.

The community became a census-designated place in 1990. In March 2008, a 398-room Great Wolf Lodge opened in Grand Mound, which was majority owned by the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation.

<doc id="138282" wikidata="Q970086" url="?curid=138282" title="Lacey, Washington">
<text>Lacey is a city in Thurston County, Washington, United States. It is a suburb of Olympia with a population of 53,526 at the 2020 census, making it the 24th most populous city in Washington. Lacey is located along Interstate 5 between Olympia and the Nisqually River, which marks the border with Pierce County and Joint Base Lewis–McChord.

==History==
Lacey was originally called Woodland after settlers Isaac and Catherine Wood, who claimed land there in 1853. By 1891, the railroad had come to the community of Woodland and the residents decided it was time to apply for a post office. The request was denied because there was already a town called Woodland on the Columbia River. The name Lacey was chosen for the new post office application, presumably after O. C. Lacey, a Justice of the Peace in Olympia. The small settlements of Woodland and Chambers Prairie consolidated into Lacey in the 1950s. 

Initial studies on incorporation of the Lacey area were first seriously conducted on October 30th, 1963 at the Lacey Chamber of Commerce, though the idea of incorporation to prevent annexation into the City of Olympia has been around since the late 1950’s.. The area proposed to be incorporated encompassed 5.64 square miles (3,610 acres) and 5,738 residents. The proposition of incorporation was placed before voters at a special election on August 11th, 1964, which ultimately failed with 505 to 847 votes.

Incorporation of Lacey would be tried again in 1966. The refined boundary proposed for incorporation grew to encompass 10.29 square miles (6,586 acres) and 8,860 residents. Voters approved incorporation at a special election held on November 8th, 1966 with 1660 to 1448 votes. Nearly a month after the election, the results were able to be certified, and the City of Lacey was officially incorporated on December 5th, 1966.

Two days later, the Olympia City Council passed a resolution setting January 24th, 1967 as the date for a special election to be held to withdraw about 2 square miles incorporated within Lacey and annex it to Olympia. Utilizing a 76 year old state law, the entire City of Olympia was able to cast votes on the annexation, rather than the common method allowing solely the residents within the proposed area of annexation to vote on the proposition. The annexation ultimately was approved by voters.

At the time, the main industries were cattle, milk, forest products, and retail. Lacey became a commuter town for Olympia, Fort Lewis and to some extent, Tacoma; in recent years, however, business developments, community groups, and population growth have led Lacey to develop into a city in its own right.

==Geography==

Lacey generally lies between Olympia to the west and the Nisqually River delta (which includes the Billy Frank Jr. Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge) to the east. The city&#x27;s northernmost point is along the Nisqually Reach on Puget Sound adjacent to Tolmie State Park and its southern boundary is a section of the BNSF Railway&#x27;s Seattle Subdivision, a major freight and passenger railway.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

==Economy==

The largest retail area in Lacey is the South Sound Center, which opened in 1966 and was originally an enclosed mall until 2000. Plans to develop a city center near the mall were considered as early as the 1990s to revitalize the area around the civic campus. The Lacey Gateway was developed in the 2000s and is home to a Cabela&#x27;s store, but failed to attract other major tenants. The Nisqually Tribe announced plans in 2023 to build Quiemuth Resort, a casino resort with a 350-room hotel adjacent to Lacey Gateway, and a mixed-use development at a nearby site.

The city designated of land in the Hawks Prairie area for industrial use in the 1990s with the intent of attracting high-tech businesses. It instead was developed into large warehouses and distribution centers that serve the Puget Sound region and connect with the Port of Seattle and Port of Tacoma. In 2003, retailer Target opened its West Coast distribution center in Lacey with of space—among the largest warehouses in the U.S. by usable volume.

It is working to meet its Alternative Energy Initiative, which includes using 100 percent green electrical energy in all of its municipal buildings, parks, utilities, and 3,000 streetlights and traffic signals; providing electric vehicle charging stations to visitors and employees at its city hall and library campus; and initiating conversion of its municipal fleet to energy efficient vehicles powered by electricity, hybrid technology, and 80/20 biofuel. Lacey has received the &quot;Tree City, USA&quot; designation from the National Arbor Day Foundation for twenty six years.

==Education==

The city is entirely within the boundaries of North Thurston Public Schools, the largest school district in Thurston County. Lacey is also home to various faith based schools, such as Holy Family School (Roman Catholic Preschool through 8th grade), Faith Lutheran School (Preschool through 8th Grade) and Foundation Campus, which includes Community Christian Academy (Pre-school to Middle School) and Northwest Christian High School. Lacey is also the home of Pope John Paul II High School.

Lacey is also home to Saint Martin&#x27;s University, a private four-year university that was founded in 1895 by the Order of Saint Benedict. The Olympia-based South Puget Sound Community College opened a satellite center in a Hawks Prairie strip mall in 1995 to serve Lacey. It was replaced in September 2015 by a larger branch campus at a former office park. The college had also purchased in 2005 to build a larger permanent campus, but sold the land after issues with wetlands mitigation were discovered.

<text>Rainier ( ) is a city in Thurston County, Washington, United States. Beginning as a train stop in the 1870s, Rainier was first settled in 1890 and would become known as a logging town. The city was officially incorporated in 1947.

==History==

Rainier began in the 1870s as a stop on the Northern Pacific Railroad line between Kalama, Washington and Tacoma. Situated amidst the ‘ten al quelth’ prairies – Lushootseed for &quot;the best yet&quot; – it was named for its view of Mount Rainier. In 1890, Albert and Maria Gehrke were the first permanent settlers to homestead in Rainier; later that year a store and post office were established by Henry Harmer, who homesteaded with his wife Jessie and children on the Deschutes River near Rainier. Rainier was officially platted in 1891.

In 1896, the community&#x27;s first full-time school as well as a Lutheran church were built by Albert Gehrke and his two brothers, Theodore and Paul; the buildings are now state historic landmarks.

In 1906, the Bob White Lumber Company opened, bringing prosperity to the area through logging and sawmilling. Other lumber companies, such as Deschutes, Gruber and Docherty, and Fir Tree, were soon attracted to the area as well. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, several of these mill operations and many of the local buildings were destroyed by a series of fires, leading many residents to seek work at Weyerhaeuser Lumber at nearby Vail, which is now a ghost town.

In 1936, Rainier&#x27;s third school was built out of brick. The construction of this new school allowed for addition of the second story, added in 1926 of the school built in 1915 to be removed, leaving it as a single story building again.

Rainier&#x27;s 1940 population was 500. In 1941, the &quot;WPA Guide to Washington&quot; described Rainier as &quot;the social center for farmers and loggers of the vicinity, although its closed mills and vacant houses mark it as a ghost lumber town.&quot;

Rainier was officially incorporated on October 23, 1947. In 1948, Rainier opened its town hall at 102 Dakota Street South; it housed the Rainier town council, police department, and fire department.

On May 4, 1974, Rainier High School was destroyed by a fire caused by an electrical fault in an attic storage space; the state&#x27;s fire marshal office had previously noted several fire hazards during inspections of the building. Classes were cancelled for the remainder of the school year; a set of 13 portable classrooms were constructed adjacent to the destroyed building by local residents and soldiers from nearby Fort Lewis. The portable buildings had been sold at cost by Seattle Public Schools after they were withdrawn from a surplus auction. A new building for Rainier High School—along with a new elementary school—was opened on September 1, 1976. In late 1979, the Town of Rainier considered leasing a portable building from Rainier School District as the existing town hall had grown too small to hold meetings in. While the school board was willing to lease the building, they were only willing to do so for a 1 year term, citing that increasing enrollment numbers could necessitate the use of the building.

In 1990, Rainier&#x27;s current Town Hall was built at 102 Rochester Street West. It was assembled from several prefabricated pieces, forming the manufactured building that serves as the Town Hall.

==Arts and culture==

===Art===
To the northeast of downtown Rainier on a trestle support over Washington State Route 507 is a mural known as the &quot;Sgt. Justin Norton Memorial Mural&quot;. Norton, who died in 2006 during the Iraq War, was a graduate of Rainier High School. Installed in 2011, repeated vandalism of the mural had led to several repairs and re-paintings.

===Festivals and events===
Rainier hosts several annual events including two in August, the Rainier Roundup Days that includes a community parade and a bluegrass music festival, and the Rainier Community &amp; Alumni Celebration honoring all past and present residents of Rainier. The community regularly hosts Relay for Life, during which, over an 18-hour time frame, participants walk around the high school track to raise money for the American Cancer Society.

===Historical buildings and sites===
In the early 2000s, the Rainier Historical Society, under the non-profit parent corporation of the Rainier Area Building Community, began restoring Rainier&#x27;s historic schoolhouse, which was built in 1915, and converting it into a community center known as the Lifelong Learning Center. In 2005, the Rainier Food Bank was opened at the site, serving patrons on Wednesdays and Saturdays. A thrift store was also opened, with the proceeds going to fund the operational costs of the building. An art gallery and public meeting rooms followed. In November 2009, the Rainier Volunteer Library opened at the center, featuring a collection of donated books available for borrowing. A partnership with the Timberland Regional Library brought the addition of a computer kiosk and the ability to pick up reserved books from the Timberland Regional Library system at the Rainier Volunteer Library. In the fall of 2011, the food bank, under the name Rainier Emergency Food Center, relocated to a nearby church due to safety concerns at the historic schoolhouse. The building, which had been near demolition, was returned to the school district to be used for offices in 2015, its centennial year, and the library and thrift store were closed.

==Parks and recreation==

Rainier features eight acres of parks. In the center of town, the Veterans Memorial Park is dedicated to veterans and active military personnel, members of the fire and police departments, and various recognized volunteers and charitable groups both in the community and throughout the United States.

Nearby, Wilkowski Park is the site of the Rainier Roundup, the city&#x27;s annual bluegrass music festival occurring on the fourth weekend in August. Beside the park, the Yelm–Rainier–Tenino Trail connects the cities of Yelm, Rainier, and Tenino in a paved pathway for pedestrians and cyclists.

Other parks in Rainier include Gehrke Park, Holiday Park, and Raintree Park.

==Government==

Rainier has a mayor–council government. In 2017, Robert Shaw became the mayor of Rainier. The city council has five members. Other government positions in Rainier include that of city administrator, clerk, treasurer, city attorney, fire chief, and public works director.

<text>Tenino () is a city in Thurston County, Washington, United States. The population was 1,870 at the 2020 census.

Incorporated in 1906, the city sits upon land first established as a food-source prairie for Native Americans living in the area. The town grew around an economy of stone quarrying, with local sandstone being used in several government and university buildings in the Pacific Northwest. With a decrease in demand for stone, the town converted one abandoned quarry into a community pool. Its downtown district is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Tenino gained notoriety during the Great Depression for the use of wooden money as public currency for its residents, a practice briefly revived during the COVID-19 pandemic. The city was named for a steamboat used during a railroad committee expedition.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name Tenino, used by the Northern Pacific Railroad for their station when it was completed on October 8, 1872, has been debated for over a century. The two main theories given for a century were that Tenino was a Chinook Jargon word for a fork or branch in the trail, or a form of T9o or 10-9-0 used by the railroad for a locomotive number, survey stake, or train car. Both these theories have been disproven for decades, but keep resurfacing because definitive proof of the actual origin was lacking.

According to city historian Richard A. Edwards, the name &quot;Tenino&quot; was used by a steamboat of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company (OSN) on the Columbia and Snake rivers. The company had transported a Northern Pacific committee in early October 1872 prior to the town&#x27;s founding; Northern Pacific had also acquired a controlling interest in the OSN earlier that year.

On October 12, 1872, at a meeting in Portland, Oregon, shortly after their tour up the Columbia River, John C. Ainsworth and other officers of the OSN made a presentation about their common interests, President Cass proposed a resolution that also named the momentarily Northern terminus near Hodgden&#x27;s station &quot;Tenino&quot;. As reported the following month in &quot;The Washington Standard&quot;, this connection allowed travel from the &quot;old Tenino&quot; (the OSN steamboat which held the record for traveling the farthest east up the Snake River), to &quot;the new town&quot; of Tenino which was the railroad&#x27;s then current northwest terminus.

In early 1873, the Northern Pacific Railroad and local homesteader Stephen Hodgden filed plats in Thurston county establishing the town of Tenino. By late 1873, the financial backing of the railroad was in financial crisis and their stock in the OSN was sold for debt, ending the railroad&#x27;s direct connection to the steamboat Tenino. The steamboat Tenino was itself named after the Tenino native band who once lived near The Dalles in Oregon and whose descendants are now part of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs.

The name also appears informally as &quot;T-9-O,&quot; a shortened variation in use as early as 1873.

==History==

===19th-century beginnings===
The city was officially incorporated on July 24, 1906, but Tenino existed as a rural community since the mid-19th century, the area containing a population of approximately 170 people by 1870 and the site fully platted in 1873. Initially, American settlers were attracted to the open prairies created and maintained by local natives through controlled burns to cultivate camas root, a staple food source. Records indicate the initial settlers&#x27; community centered on the prairie approximately south of the present town. Early residents named their first post office and school &quot;Coal Bank&quot;, in the 1860s, a reference to a nearby coal outcropping. It was later renamed Tenino.

The railroad ended at Tenino for a time after Northern Pacific underwent financial difficulties, making the town the final passenger and freight stop on the line to Olympia. Timber production and manufacturing, as well as agriculture and mining, were early economic factors in Tenino, contributing to the community&#x27;s growth. The largest part of the local economy was the quarrying of sandstone. Numerous buildings in Tenino&#x27;s early days of formation were built of sandstone.

The area was rich in sandstone and part of a geologic layer known as the McIntosh Formation. By the late 19th century, a number of sandstone quarrying companies began shipping the stone as a construction material for large buildings on the West Coast. Buildings that used Tenino sandstone withstood two catastrophic events, the Great Seattle Fire of 1889 and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, leading to the increase and popularity of the material. Eventually, Tenio sandstone was used in the construction of the Old Capitol Building and the old Thurston County Courthouse in Olympia, the rebuilt Seattle public library, the Mason County Courthouse in Shelton, the First Congregational Church, developed by Cameron Stone, in Tacoma, Denny Hall and the Theodore Jacobson Observatory at the University of Washington, the Pittock Mansion and the Pioneer Courthouse in Portland, Oregon, the Calvary Presbyterian Church of San Francisco and several US post office buildings, including at The Dalles, Oregon. Additional buildings constructed with Tenio sandstone include the Portland Public Library and the Science Hall at Washington State University. The US Government also used stone from these quarries to construct jetties at Westport, Washington and elsewhere.

===20th century===
The quarries declined in the early 20th century when many builders switched to concrete. Logging, saw mills, and coal mining remained as well established industries in the area. However, as the timber played out and railroads switched to diesel in the mid-20th century, these industries also declined.

During the late 1940s and early 1950s, before the construction of Interstate 5, a notorious stretch along U.S. Route 99 through Tenino gained a reputation as the &quot;Speed Trap of the West&quot;. Many motorists considered it a speed trap because of the strict enforcement by police of the abruptly reduced speed limit through town.

Since the mid-1970s, the US Army has used a geographical map of Tenino as a training aid in map reading, because of the variety of symbols represented on the map.

===21st century===
While Tenino retains its historic downtown, now a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the town serves largely as a &quot;bedroom community&quot;, many of its citizens commuting by car to larger cities such as Olympia and Tacoma for work.

Protests were held in the city in 2023 to voice opposition to the creation of a state contracted transitional facility for sex offenders that would have been located next to Tenino&#x27;s City Park. The facility operator cancelled the project after a few weeks of objections from the community. Due to the dissent, several bills were proposed in the state legislature that would add stricter requirements and better communication policies regarding sex offender housing.

A sesquicentennial jubilee celebrating Tenino&#x27;s 150 years as a recognized community was held in July 2023. The day-long event hosted a parade and vendor markets, with the highlight of a &quot;birthday card&quot; written in chalk by artists on a closed intersection in the city. The city&#x27;s U.S. House of Representative at the time, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, bestowed Tenino with a Congressional Record copy of a floor speech she gave honoring the community and its achievement. In December, a bill was introduced at the state legislature that would declare Tenino sandstone as the state rock.

===Wooden money===

Tenino briefly achieved national notoriety during the Great Depression of the 1930s. After the local bank failed in 1931, the town government temporarily issued wooden money scrip, made of thin-cut cedar and spruce, and was used by Tenino&#x27;s residents when cash was scarce. However, most of this wooden currency was never redeemed as it became a valuable collector&#x27;s item. The Tenino Depot Museum continues to use the original printing machinery, creating new wooden tender for souvenir purposes, but the dollars can still be used at some Tenino businesses. 

The city began printing the wooden currency again during the COVID-19 recession in 2020, to distribute to the local residents. The revival of the program was approved by the Washington State Auditor and began in May 2020.

==Economy==
One of Tenino&#x27;s main economic outputs is agriculture, particularly livestock for consumption. After the loss of a meat processing plant within the region, the city and county began plans to develop a more encompassing business park to help the local economy. Given the moniker, Southwest Washington Agricultural Business &amp; Innovation Park, construction began in 2023 with plans to contain a slaughterhouse, food processing, an event center, and buildings to house small businesses. Funding of $1.25 million from the state legislature was secured for future phases of construction with an additional $4.4 million proposed at the federal level.

==Education==
One of the first schools constructed in the county, after the formation of the Washington Territory, was erected approximately in 1862 at was then referred to as the Coal Bank Precinct. The school operated in its first year with a $78 budget and pupils included both settler and indigenous children. A district split around 1878 led to the build of a schoolhouse near an oak tree at present-day Tenino City Park. The new school expanded twice in 1890 and 1908 after population increases in the community and by 1909, high school studies were introduced up to 9th grade; high school student enrollment was 14. A gymnasium and larger building were added in 1917. A high school was completed in 1924, with a gym added the following year.

==Arts and culture==

===Festivals and events===
Inspired by a mayoral proclamation in 1968 for Tenino to honor pioneer history and culture, the city began holding an annual weekend &quot;Oregon Trail Days&quot; festival. The original directive asked the gentlemen of the community not to shave but men could opt out by purchasing a &quot;beardless permit&quot; for $2. Demonstrations of logging, blacksmithing, railroad work, and pioneer home life often highlight the event. &quot;Black powder shoots&quot;, historical exhibits, live music, cuisine, vintage car shows, and a parade round out the celebration. Several other organizations, such as the local farmer&#x27;s market and rock-and-gem shows, will often hold events concurrently throughout the city.

The Tenino Farmers Market is held annually between early May and the end September. It is part of the Washington State Farmers Market Association and holds special market events for Mother&#x27;s Day and Father&#x27;s Day.

===Historic buildings and sites===
In 2020, Tenino created the &quot;Tenino Creative Arts District&quot; by certification thru the Washington state Arts Commission. The area, designated as including the historic downtown, business district, and the entirety of Tenino City Park, is projected to include public art of various mediums, including murals and metal banners and signs depicting Tenino&#x27;s history. A scavenger hunt is to be based on the artworks. The banners, 23 in total, were added to light poles in the downtown district in October 2023.

De Beers heiress, Rebecca L. Oppenheimer, built a luxury home &quot;Merkaba&quot; near Tenino. In 2023, it was sold for $2.3M to former child actor, Scott Strader.

===Theater===
A non-profit theater group, known as the Tenino Young-at-Heart Theatre (TYT), was formed in 1990 and produces live performances at various locations throughout the city. The TYT purchased land, with help from an anonymous donor, near the high school in 2021 with plans to build a performing arts center.

===Tourism===
The city is home to the Tenino Sandstone Walking tour which honors the community&#x27;s sandstone past. Local stone carver shops, and the sculptures they produce, are the main attraction of the tour. Tenino provides options for visitors to tour the city, or travel on the Yelm–Rainier–Tenino Trail, be means of the Yellow Bike project, a bicycle-sharing system started by the city in 2001.

==Parks and recreation==

The largest park in the community is Tenino City Park. Listed at , the park sits south of the center of town, with the Yelm–Rainier-Tenino Trail crossing through the area. The park contains the Tenino Stone Quarry community pool, the renovated Quarry House, and the Tenino Depot Museum, along with various ballfields and picnic areas. The grounds were expanded by during a 2011 &quot;Save Our Park&quot; movement to save land and trails existing behind the park footprint from being logged.

A supplemental appropriation of over $500,000 was awarded to the city in 2022 for the rebuild of the Tenino City Park&#x27;s playground after damage from a winter storm the prior year. The new play area, named Maytown Community Playground, was opened in 2023. An additional improvement that year to the park was the installation of three pump tracks of various difficulty levels. The tracks were built using funds from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The grounds were expanded once again in 2024 with the addition of an adjacent woodland parcel using funds donated from a conservancy foundation.

Tenino is home to Wolf Haven International, and , the only wolf sanctuary in the world accredited with the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries (GFAS).

The South Sound Speedway, a Figure 8 racetrack, is immediately southwest of the downtown area.

==Historic buildings and structures==

There are 26 historic sites in or near Tenino. Following are some of those properties.

==Media==
Tenino once had a local newspaper called the Independent. The independent movie, The Mountain, with Jeff Goldblum, was partially filmed in Tenino.

==Infrastructure==
Tenino is situated along the old route of Highway 99 which bisected the town. The community&#x27;s fortunes and growth waned, with traffic being diverted away from Tenino after the construction of Interstate 5 in the 1950s and 1960s.

Into the 2000s, Tenino was bereft of a local sewer system with most residences and businesses relying on septic. A master plan for a centralized system, including a waste treatment facility, was introduced by the town council in 2002.

<text>Tumwater is a city in Thurston County, Washington, United States. The population was 25,350 at the 2020 census. The city is situated near where the Deschutes River enters Budd Inlet, the southernmost point of Puget Sound; it also borders the state capital of Olympia to the north.

Tumwater was originally called &quot;New Market&quot; by American settlers, and under the latter name was platted in 1845. The present name is derived from Chinook Jargon and means &quot;waterfall&quot;. A post office called Tumwater was established in 1863.

==History==
The site of Tumwater and Tumwater Falls has been home to Southern Lushootseed-speaking peoples known as the Steh-Chass / Stehchass or Statca&#x27;sabsh (a subtribe of the Sahewamish (Sahe&#x27;wabsh), an subgroup of the Nisqually people; who became part of the post-treaty Squaxin Island Tribe) for thousands of years. &quot;Steh-Chass&quot; is the Lushootseed name for Budd Inlet, Deschutes River and the Tumwater Falls area, and for an important village of the Statca&#x27;sabsh.

Tumwater was incorporated as a town on November 25, 1869, and as a city in 1875.

The construction of Interstate 5, which was completed in 1958, required the demolition of 100 buildings in downtown Tumwater.

==Arts and culture==
The Davis Meeker oak tree, listed on the Tumwater Register of Historic Places, is a 400-year-old historic Garry oak located at the Olympia Regional Airport on Old Highway 99. Named after Ezra Meeker and Jack Davis, an environmentalist who helped save the oak in 1984 during a highway improvement project, the tree was a trail maker on the Cowlitz Trail, and then later on the Oregon Trail. In 2024, safety for passing motorists became a concern when a branch broke and fell several feet near the roadway. Tumwater&#x27;s mayor, Debbie Sullivan, attempted to remove the tree in May of that year without the support of the city council based on a 2023 report of the city&#x27;s arborist that concluded the tree was high risk; the report was criticized for having numerous flaws. Due to public protests, coupled with a citizen lawsuit and report discrepancies, the mayor paused her efforts and agreed to obtain a second opinion. Options to save the tree were announced by the city in February 2025.

Four identical concrete totem poles are located on the Art Deco-style Carlyon Bridge in Tumwater. The Haida-style sculptures contain, from the top, a raven, a grizzly bear, an eagle, and another bear. The totems were added as part of an overall project on Capitol Boulevard in 1937. The sculptures, when erected, were considered to be the only known concrete totems in the world. They remained without color until 1951, painted with some hues regarded to be non-traditional in indigenous works, but repainted after 1990. The designer of the totems is unknown.

==Government==
Due to the city being located in close proximity to the state capital, Tumwater is home to many state government offices, including the Washington State Department of Corrections, the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries, the Washington State Department of Health, the Washington State Office of the Insurance Commissioner, the Washington State Department of Revenue and the Office of the Attorney General.

The City of Tumwater itself is a non-charter Code City and uses a Mayor-Council form of government. The Mayor is elected as a chief executive officer and advised by seven council members who act as policymakers and provide guidelines and performance objectives. The Tumwater City Council elections are held in odd-numbered years.

==Education==
The Tumwater School District is home to numerous schools including Tumwater High School and Black Hills High School.

<text>Yelm () is a city in Thurston County, Washington, United States. Its population was 10,617 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The word &quot;Yelm&quot; is said to come from the Coast Salish word &quot;shelm&quot; or &quot;chelm&quot;, meaning &quot;heat waves from the sun&quot;, referring to heat mirages.

The Yelm Prairie was originally inhabited by the Nisqually and provided good pasture for their horses. The first permanent non-indigenous settlers came in 1853 to join the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company sheep farmers who already conducted business in the area.

James Longmire, one of the first American settlers, said upon arriving in Yelm:
With the coming of the Northern Pacific Railway in 1873, Yelm began to prosper, having found an outlet for its agricultural and forestry products. Its economic base was further enhanced when an irrigation company created the Yelm Ditch in 1916, making Yelm a center for commercial production of beans, cucumbers and berries.

Yelm was incorporated on December 8, 1924.

During the Great Depression, high maintenance costs and an unstructured water distribution plan bankrupted the Yelm Irrigation Company.

At the beginning of the 21st century, Yelm was the 10th fastest growing city in the state in regard to population.

==Geography==

Yelm is located in southeastern Thurston County, adjacent to its border with Pierce County, along the Nisqually River. The city is near the Nisqually Indian Reservation (located to the northwest on State Route 510), and Joint Base Lewis–McChord on the northeast side of the river. Another major highway, State Route 507, connects Yelm to Centralia and Spanaway near Tacoma.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

<text>Touchet ( ) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Walla Walla County, Washington, United States. The population was 421 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Prior to removal to reservations, there was a village of Walla Walla people located near the present townsite. This site was called Tuushi, meaning &quot;baking salmon on sticks over coals&quot;, a name based on a coyote myth. Bands of Palouse, Yakamas, Umatilla, Walla Walla and Wanapum, that used this area were collectively called Nez Perce by Lewis and Clark when they passed through the Walla Walla Valley on their return journey in 1806.

Settlers from the east came to the valley in the early 1850s, but shortly left due to conflicts with the Native people. Homesteaders returned to the valley in 1859.

The Walla Walla &amp; Columbia River Railroad from Wallula to Walla Walla was not completed until 1875, but by March 1874, 16 miles of track were completed up to Touchet. By the end of that year Touchet farmers shipped 4,000 tons of wheat and received 1,100 tons of merchandise.

Touchet has never been officially incorporated.

<doc id="138299" wikidata="Q1506464" url="?curid=138299" title="Waitsburg, Washington">
<text>Waitsburg is a city in Walla Walla County, Washington, United States. The population was 1,166 at the 2020 census. Waitsburg has a unique city classification in Washington state, being the state&#x27;s only city which still operates under its territorial charter.

Located on the Touchet River in an rural area of Southeastern Washington, Waitsburg has long been tied to the agricultural economy of its surrounding region. The milling of wheat played a prominent role in the first century of Waitsburg&#x27;s existence, though in recent decades the economy has pivoted towards viticulture and tourism due to its location within the Walla Walla AVA. The downtown core of the community, dating to the 1880s, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Waitsburg Historic District.

==History==
Prior to settlement by European American pioneers, the area that is now Waitsburg was home to the Palouse people. The juncture of the Touchet River and Coppei Creek, where Waitsburg would eventually develop, was recorded in the journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition during their return trip in 1806. 

Waitsburg was first settled in 1859 by Robert Kennedy. Another early settler, Albert Gallatin Lloyd, helped settle persistent confrontations with the Palouse people by negotiating a treaty allowing the native population to camp on the land that he claimed. The arrangement established by that treaty, though not backed up by law, continued informally into the 1940s. William Perry Bruce and his wife, Caroline, moved to Waitsburg in 1861, some two decades before Waitsburg was officially incorporated on November 25, 1881. In 1882, they built a large home in the town, which today functions as a museum.

Early settlers raised cattle and horses and grew grain along the banks of the Touchet River and the creeks which feed into it. During the 1860s, dryland farming of the adjacent hills led to expansion of wheat production around Waitsburg. That development, along with the discovery of gold in the valley of the Clearwater River to the east, brought an influx of population to the area. Due to the mining boom in the Clearwater region, a stagecoach line was established connecting Walla Walla in the west with Lewiston, Idaho, at the juncture of the Clearwater and Snake Rivers, to the east, passed through what would become Waitsburg, bringing travelers heading to and from the mines. This connection between the nascent Waitsburg community and the mining district led to a meeting between Dennis Willard, a landowner in the Waitsburg area, and Sylvester M. Wait, in Lewiston in 1864. Willard convinced Wait of the potential to ship wheat flour down the Touchet valley and allowed him to establish a mill on his land that same year. The city of Waitsburg would later be named for Sylvester M. Wait.
With the establishment of the mill, a community began to coalesce around Wait&#x27;s mill which included a school, saloon, store, hotel and post office. The town was platted in 1869 and named Waitsburg. By 1870, the town was home to over 100 residents in 35 dwellings and an assortment of businesses. N. J. A. Smith, an early settler and schoolmaster, called Waitsburg the only place of note between Walla Walla and Lewiston. Waitsburg&#x27;s notability continued to expand throughout the 1870s, during which it would be connected by telegraph line to Portland, Oregon and with the establishment of a newspaper, the &quot;Waitsburg Times&quot;.
Disaster struck on September 13, 1880, when a fire ravaged the town&#x27;s business district. The area was quickly rebuilt, this time with brick, and a year later, in 1881, the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company completed a line through Waitsburg connecting it by rail with Walla Walla and the outside world. On November 25, 1881, the city was officially incorporated as the City of Waitsburg. The original charter was revised five years later, in 1886, and the revised charter has been in place ever since. It was under the revised charter that official city services like police, fire and utilities came to the community. Waitsburg&#x27;s commercial importance as a mill town continued to grow throughout this decade and the Walt&#x27;s Mill, no longer owned by Walt and eventually known as Washington Mills was expanded and improved, notably with the introduction of steel machinery. By the end of the decade in 1890, Waitsburg&#x27;s population exceeded 800 people.

The mill continued to be the economic heart of Waitsburg through the late 1800s and into the mid-20th century. In 1936 it was converted from a water-powered mill to electric. It would operate as an electric mill for over two decades until it was closed down in 1957. The abandoned mill stood until a fire destroyed it in 2009. Despite the closure of the mill, Waitsburg remained relatively stable economically and in terms of population throughout the second half of the 20th century as a commercial center supporting the surrounding agricultural region. 

Since the turn of the 21st century, Waitsburg&#x27;s economic fortunes have been bolstered by the growth of the wine industry. The community is located in the Walla Walla AVA and has become a destination for wine tourists. During the first two decades of the 21st century, numerous businesses were established catering to these tourists including specialty restaurants, bars and hotels. Waitsburg&#x27;s culinary scene was recognized nationally in 2024 when Bar Barcello was one of 10 nominees for the 2024 James Beard Award for Best New Restaurant.

<text>Walla Walla ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Walla Walla County, Washington, United States. It had a population of 34,060 at the 2020 census, estimated to have decreased to 33,339 as of 2023. The combined population of the city and its two suburbs, the town of College Place and unincorporated Walla Walla East, is about 45,000.

Walla Walla is in the southeastern region of Washington, approximately four hours away from Portland, Oregon, and four and a half hours from Seattle. It is located only north of the Oregon border.

==History==
===Native history and early settlement===

Walla Walla&#x27;s history starts in 1806 when the Lewis and Clark expedition encountered the Walawalałáma (Walla Walla people) near the mouth of Walla Walla River. Other inhabitants of the valley included the Liksiyu (Cayuse), Imatalamłáma (Umatilla), and Niimíipu (Nez Perce) indigenous peoples. In 1818, Fort Walla Walla (originally Fort Nez Percés), a fur trading outpost run by Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC), was established and operated as an important stopping point in Oregon Country. Abandoned in 1855, it is now underwater behind the McNary Dam.

On October 16, 1836, after news of a Nez Perce expedition to learn about Christianity and a deal was brokered between the Cayuse people for the use of the Waiilatpu region, Calvinist missionaries Marcus and Narcissa Whitman established the Whitman Mission. A deep distrust of the settlers was cultivated between the Cayuse and the settlers as the Whitmans struggled to convert the natives, failed to fulfill promises, and shifted their focus to whites passing through along the Oregon Trail. In 1847, following a deadly measles outbreak, and reports of the Whitmans poisoning the Cayuse, the Whitmans were warned to leave the area because of the Cayuse custom of killing medicine men whose patients died. They refused to leave, and were killed by the Cayuse, along with 12 others. The site was later designated as Whitman National Monument, a National Historic Site.

Catholic missionaries also arrived in the 1840s, and the Catholic ceremonies resonated with the tribe. On July 24, 1846, Pope Pius IX established the Diocese of Walla Walla. Augustin-Magloire Blanchet was appointed the first Bishop of Walla Walla, but fled shortly after the Whitman massacre. The Diocese of Walla Walla is now a titular see held by Witold Mroziewski, an auxiliary bishop of Brooklyn, New York.

In 1855, the Walla Walla Treaty Council was held at Waiilatpu between the Washington Territorial Assembly and the tribal leaders of the surrounding area. Despite the indigenous people citing Tamanwit (natural law), the following year the natives agreed to surrender millions of acres of land for a native reservation and $150,000. The Umatilla Indian Reservation&#x27;s boundaries eventually shrunk to less than .

===Founding===
The Walla Walla treaty remained unratified for four years, during which time the conflict between the natives and settlers was increasing due to frontiersmen encroaching on the promised reservation and the Walla Walla and Umatilla peoples&#x27; refusal to move to the Umatilla Indian Reservation. The United States Army established a presence in a series of military forts beginning in 1856. A community named &quot;Steptoeville&quot; grew around Fort Walla Walla, named for Lieutenant Colonel Edward Steptoe, and later his name was bestowed upon Steptoe, Washington. The fort has since been restored with a museum about the early settlers&#x27; lives.

Growth in the region was limited due to a ban on immigration to the area due to the constant warring with the natives from the Department of the Pacific&#x27;s General John Ellis Wool, who was sympathetic to the natives. In 1858, the department was split, leaving Washington territory under the command of General William S. Harney, who lifted the ban on October 31, 1858. Thousands of pioneers swarmed to the area, creating a burgeoning farming and mining community.

On March 15, 1859, Walla Walla county held its first county commission and election in the community&#x27;s first church, St. Patrick&#x27;s Church, which still serves as the city&#x27;s parish. Following the ratification of the Walla Walla treaty, the commission voted to name the settlement Walla Walla, on November 17, 1859 and the military carried out the forced displacement of the remaining natives, under the threat of hanging.


On December 20, 1859, the first educational charter was granted to Whitman Seminary, a high school, which opened on October 15, 1866. In 1882, the institution&#x27;s name was changed to Whitman College, and the legislature issued a new educational charter as a four-year private college.

The Mullan Road, the first wagon road to cross the Rocky Mountains into the Pacific Northwest, tied Walla Walla to more mining opportunities, and after gold was discovered in 1860, the area became the outfitting point for the Oro Fino, Idaho mines. The nearest part of the road followed the modern approximate path from Spokane to Walla Walla via Interstate 90, U.S. Route 195, and U.S. Route 12. The population swelled due to the gold rush, resulting in an unsuccessful proposal to Congress to split Walla Walla from Washington into its own territory.

===Gold rush and growth===
Walla Walla was incorporated on January 11, 1862. The first election was held on April 1, 1862, and Judge Elias Bean Whitman, Marcus Whitman&#x27;s cousin, was elected as the city&#x27;s first mayor. The population exploded over the following decade, increasing by 300%, making it the most populous city in the territory, slating it to be the capital until cities surpassed it again, after it was bypassed by the transcontinental rail lines in the 1880s.

During the 1860s, the city established its first businesses and community gathering spaces, a number of which served as the first in Pacific Northwest. The city&#x27;s first newspaper was one of the first between Missouri and the Cascades, the &quot;Washington Statesman&quot;, was founded in 1861&quot;.&quot; The first bank, Baker Boyer Bank, was the first in the state, was founded in 1869 by one of the city&#x27;s first council members, Dorsey Syng Baker and his brother-in-law John Franklin Boyer, and as of March 2022, still served as the oldest bank in state. The Pioneer Meat Market, run by partners John Dooley and William Kirkman, was opened during this time and remained there until they sold it to Christopher Ennis in 1882 and founded the Walla Walla Dressed Meat Company.

One of the first brick buildings in the city was also Walla Walla&#x27;s first store, Schwabacher Brothers Store on Main street, which served as the city&#x27;s grocer, builder supply, and clothes shop. Sigmond Schwabacher, one of the brothers, also served in the city&#x27;s council. The city&#x27;s first book store was opened in 1864, and an academic community formed around the city&#x27;s book collection as the Calliopean Society and later incorporated as the Walla Walla Library Association. The city also had one of the region&#x27;s first breweries, Emil Meyer&#x27;s City Brewery, that also served as a bakery. Downtown also hosted a post office, several hotels, restaurants, a bathhouse and shaving saloon, a liquor store, a drugstore, and several manufactories.

During the gold rush, large populations of Chinese settlers arrived in the city from Portland, Oregon, creating a neighborhood referred to as &quot;Chinatown&quot;. The Chinese settlers mainly worked in commerce, mining, and railroad contracts. After Mullan was unable to lobby the state to make Walla Walla a major railroad stop, and a fire in Chinatown destroyed most of the neighborhood, the immigrants left to find work elsewhere, including Eng Ah King, who was informally known as the &quot;mayor of Chinatown&quot; for revitalizing Seattle&#x27;s Chinatown.

In 1886, while Washington was lobbying for statehood, local business man Levi Ankeny donated 160 acres of land to the city to serve as the site of a new prison. Legislators approved the site, and in 1887, the state began transferring prisoners to the Washington Territorial Prison from Saatco Prison, a privately owned facility that was shut down in 1888 because of its poor living conditions. The first inmate was a local, William Murphy, who was serving an 18-year sentence for manslaughter. There have been many prison escapes attempted in the prison&#x27;s history. In 1887, the prison took in its first woman inmate, and had to improvise accommodations until a separate facility was built nearby. When Washington became a state in 1889, the facility officially became the Washington State Penitentiary, but inmates nicknamed it &quot;The Hill&quot;, &quot;The Joint&quot;, &quot;The Walls&quot;, and &quot;The Pen&quot;.

===Agricultural center===
As the gold rush died out, the city developed into an agricultural center referred to as the &quot;cradle of Pacific Northwest history&quot;, and the &quot;garden city&quot;, a popular source for onions, apples, peas, and wine grapes.

Italian settlers from Lonate Pozzolo and Calabria regions formed the core of the gardening industry, and settled in neighborhoods known as &quot;Blalock&quot; and the &quot;South Ninth&quot;. One of the main contributions of the Italians to Walla Walla commerce was their vineyards, and soon after, wine tasting rooms, the first two opened in the 1880s by Frank Orselli and Pasquale Saturno. The Italian Walla Walla population was also responsible for growing Washington State&#x27;s official vegetable, the Walla Walla sweet onion.

It was the technique of dryland farming, though, that made Walla Walla the region&#x27;s breadbasket known for its wheat exports. The cultivating of grains brought hundreds of Seventh-day Adventists (SDA) to the city, building Walla Walla College and the Walla Walla Sanitarium. The SDA population was followed by hundreds of Volga Germans, whose Old Lutheran and Mennonite religions were connected to SDA in Prussia. The immigrants had relied on dryland farming of wheat crops in Volgograd, Russia. The neighborhood built around the Russian-German immigrants is known as &quot;Germantown&quot; or &quot;Russische Ecke (Russian Corner)&quot; to locals, referring to the creek that runs through it as &quot;Little Volga&quot;. The area around Walla Walla College eventually incorporated as its own city, College Place, Washington.

German immigrants also grew hops and the city was home to several breweries. By the 1890s, wine, beer, liquor, and tobacco taxes accounted for 90% of the city&#x27;s revenue, but the alcohol industries died out with Prohibition in the United States.

As the city became dependent on its wheat production, merchants in the town financed a railroad to Wallula, Washington, to connect Walla Walla to the Columbia River, completed in 1875.

===20th century===
In 1911, Walla Walla adopted a mayor–council government referred to as a &quot;commission&quot; form of government. In 1954, after Sunnyside, Washington adopted another form of government, council–manager government, voted down a change to council-manager, but on November 4, 1959, the city&#x27;s residents voted to adopt the government form.

Walla Walla&#x27;s second movie theater, American Theater, opened in 1917 showing &quot;The Law of Compensation&quot;, a Selznick Pictures film starring Norma Talmadge. The theater later was sold and renamed to Liberty, and eventually became a department store around the 1930s. In 1990, became Walla Walla&#x27;s first privately renovated building as a Bon-Macy&#x27;s. Bon-Macy&#x27;s parent company, Federated Department Stores, rebranded all of its subsidiaries to Macy&#x27;s, which operated in the Liberty building until 2020.

In 1927, the Real Estate Improvement Company of Seattle invested $300,000 toward the construction of the Marcus Whitman Hotel. The 174-room hotel was designed by Sherwood D. Ford and opened in 1928. It fell into disrepair in the 1960s, until it was restored in 1999 and reopened in 2001. , the hotel was still open.

Mill Creek overflowed into Walla Walla and College Place on March 31, 1931, causing $1 million in damages. Community volunteers jury-rigged makeshift levees to divert water from buildings during the cleanup which cost roughly $100,000. The United States Army Corps of Engineers built the Mill Creek Dam and Bennington Lake in response to the disaster. The dam and lake were instrumental in preventing damage from flooding in 1964, 1996, and 2020.

During the Great Depression, a Canadian import duty cut off the main market for Walla Walla&#x27;s fresh agriculture. John Grant Kelly, who owned the &quot;Walla Walla Union-Bulletin&quot; at the time, opened the area&#x27;s first cannery, Walla Walla Canning Company. In 1939, Walla Walla produced roughly $5 million of the country&#x27;s $30 million canned green pea industry, and &quot;TIME&quot; magazine referred to Kelly as the &quot;Father of Peas&quot;. Kelly also owned Church Grape Juice Company, a concord grape farm in Kennewick, Washington. Workers went on strike for better wages in September 1949, and Kelly had two employees arrested for speaking to the &quot;Tri-City Herald&quot;. Church was one of four juice companies in the region to be charged with violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 for price-fixing grapes. Welch&#x27;s bought Church from Kelly in 1952.

In 1936, Walla Walla and surrounding areas were struck by the magnitude 6.1 State Line earthquake. Residents reported hearing a moderate rumbling immediately before the shock. There was significant damage in the area, and aftershocks were felt for several months following.

in the 1970s and 1980s, Leonetti Cellar, Woodward Canyon, L&#x27;Ecole 41, Waterbrook Winery and Seven Hills Winery pioneered a resurgence of Walla Walla&#x27;s viticulture.

In 1997, Gary Johnson founded the first brewery in Walla Walla since prohibition, Mill Creek Brewpub.

===21st century===
In 2001, Walla Walla was a Great American Main Street Award winner for the transformation and preservation of its once dilapidated main street. In July 2011, &quot;USA Today&quot; selected Walla Walla as the friendliest small city in the United States. Walla Walla was also named Friendliest Small Town in America the same year as part of Rand McNally&#x27;s annual Best of the Road contest. In 2012 and 2013, Walla Walla was a runner-up in the best food category for the Best of the Road. Downtown Walla Walla was awarded a Great Places in America Great Neighborhood designation in 2012 by the American Planning Association.

In the 2010s, Walla Walla&#x27;s brewery industry experienced a revival. The first hops farms since prohibition were planted in 2018, and in 2019, Washington State Department of Corrections announced a plan to bring a vineyard and hopyard to Washington State Penitentiary, along with agricultural science education to prepare inmates for careers in the field. The program would offer inmates state-wide minimum wages, a practice only legally enforced by state law at private institutions. The city hosted its first beer festival in February 2020.

In 2017, and annually, Walla Walla&#x27;s mayor signed a proclamation making the third Saturday of September &quot;Adam West Day&quot;, to honor the actor, who was born and raised in the city. In 2020, the event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the organizers announced that the city approved the erection of a statue in West&#x27;s honor and a GoFundMe fundraiser to cover the costs of the statue. The statue will be placed in Menlo Park on Alvarado Terrace, part of Historic Downtown Walla Walla.

==Etymology==
Walla Walla is Nez Perce for &quot;Place of Many Waters&quot;, because the original settlement was at the junction of the Snake and Columbia rivers.

Tourists to Walla Walla are often told that it is a &quot;town so nice they named it twice&quot;. The slogan was coined by Al Jolson, who had visited the city in the early 1900s in The Keylor Grand Theater. He had also said the same of New York, New York. The quote referring to Walla Walla was in The Jolson Story, a musical about the entertainer&#x27;s life.

Some locals and Walla Walla natives often refer to the city in text form with &quot;W2&quot;.

==Geography and climate==
Walla Walla is located in the Walla Walla Valley, with the rolling Palouse hills to the north and the Blue Mountains to the east of town. Various creeks meander through town before combining to become the Walla Walla River, which drains into the Columbia River about west of town. The city lies in the rain shadow of the Cascade Mountains, so annual precipitation is fairly low.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Walla Walla has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate according to the Köppen climate classification system (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Doak&quot;). It is one of the northernmost locations in North America to qualify as having such a climate. In contrast to most other locations having this climate type in North America, Walla Walla can experience fairly cold winter conditions, though they are still relatively mild for its latitude and inland location.

==Economy==

===Agriculture===
Though wheat is still a significant crop, vineyards and wineries have become economically important over the last three decades. In summer 2020, there were over 120 wineries in the greater Walla Walla area. Following the wine boom, the town has developed several fine dining establishments and luxury hotels. The Marcus Whitman Hotel, originally opened in 1928, was renovated with original fixtures and furniture. It is the tallest building in the city, at 13 stories.

The Walla Walla Sweet Onion and the Great Grape are a few crops with a rich tradition. Over a century ago on the Island of Corsica, off the west coast of Italy, a French soldier named Peter Pieri found an Italian sweet onion seed and brought it to the Walla Walla Valley. Impressed by the new onion&#x27;s winter hardiness, Pieri, and the Italian immigrant farmers who comprised much of Walla Walla&#x27;s gardening industry, harvested the seed.

The sweet onion developed over several generations through the process of selecting onions from each year&#x27;s crop, targeting sweetness, size and round shape. The Walla Walla Sweet Onion is designated under federal law as a protected agricultural crop. In 2007 the Walla Walla Sweet Onion became Washington&#x27;s official state vegetable. There is also a Walla Walla Sweet Onion Festival, held annually in July. Walla Walla Sweet Onions have low sulfur content (about half that of an ordinary yellow onion) and are 90 percent water.

Walla Walla currently has two farmers markets, both held from May until October. The first is located on the corner of 4th and Main, and is coordinated by the Downtown Walla Walla Foundation. The other is at the Walla Walla County Fairgrounds on S. Ninth Ave, run by the Walla Walla Valley Farmer&#x27;s Market.

===Wine industry===

Walla Walla has experienced an expansion in its wine industry in recent decades, culminating in the area being named &quot;Best Wine Region&quot; in USA Today&#x27;s Reader Choice Awards in both 2020 and 2021. Several local wineries have received top scores from wine publications such as &quot;Wine Spectator&quot;, &quot;The Wine Advocate&quot; and &quot;Wine and Spirits&quot;. Although most of the early recognition went to the wines made from Merlot and Cabernet, Syrah is fast becoming a star varietal in this appellation. Overall, there are more than 120 wineries in the Walla Walla area, which collectively generate over $100 million for the valley annually.

Walla Walla Community College offers an associate degree (AAAS) in winemaking and grape growing through its Center for Enology and Viticulture, which operates its own commercial winery, College Cellars.

One challenge to growing grapes in Walla Walla Valley is the risk of a killing freeze during the winter. On average these happen once every six or seven years; the penultimate occurrence (in 2004) destroyed about 75% of the wine grape crop in the valley. In November 2010 the valley was again hit with a killing frost, leading to a 28% decline in Cabernet Sauvignon production, a 20% decline in red grape production, and an overall decline in production of 11% (red and white varietals).

===Corrections industry===

The second-largest prison in Washington, after nearby Coyote Ridge Corrections Center in Connell, is the Washington State Penitentiary (WSP) located in Walla Walla, at 1313 North 13th. Originally opened in 1886, it now houses about 2,000 offenders. In addition, there are about 1000 staff members. In 2005, the financial benefit to the local economy was estimated to be about $55 million through salaries, medical services, utilities, and local purchases. In 2014, the penitentiary underwent an extensive expansion project to increase the prison capacity to 2,500 violent offenders and double the staff size.

Until October 11, 2018, Washington was a death penalty state, and occasional executions took place at the state penitentiary; the last execution took place on September 10, 2010. Washington was also one of the last two states to allow hanging as a choice when sentenced to death (the other being New Hampshire); there has not been a hanging since May 1994 (the default method of execution was changed to lethal injection in 1996). Washington was the last state with an active gallows. 80 executions were carried out at the prison between 1904 and 2010.

The most notable inmate has been Gary Ridgway, a serial killer known as the &quot;Green River killer&quot;, who was still incarcerated there as of November 2021.

==Infrastructure==

Transportation to Walla Walla includes service by air through Walla Walla Regional Airport, several railroads, and highway access primarily from U.S. Route 12. The Washington State Department of Transportation is engaged in a long-term process of widening this road into a four-lane divided highway between Pasco and Walla Walla. The most recent portion was completed in June 2023. The highway also acts as the main gateway to Interstates 82 and 84, which run to the west and south, respectively. State Route 125 runs through the city, north to State Route 124 in Prescott and south to Milton-Freewater, Oregon, becoming Oregon Highway 11 at the state line.

The city of Milton-Freewater, Oregon has a single-line bus service with several stops in town with two stops in College Place and five in Walla Walla. Travel Washington&#x27;s Grape Line is a intercity service between Walla Walla and Pasco that runs three times a day. Finally, Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation operates a Kayak bus to Pendleton, with four trips each weekday and two trips each Saturday via its Walla Walla Whistler route.

<text>Dwarfism is a condition of people and animals marked by unusually small size or short stature. In humans, it is sometimes defined as an adult height of less than , regardless of sex; the average adult height among people with dwarfism is . &quot;Disproportionate dwarfism&quot; is characterized by either short limbs or a short torso. In cases of &quot;proportionate dwarfism&quot;, both the limbs and torso are unusually small. Intelligence is usually normal, and most people with it have a nearly normal life expectancy. People with dwarfism can usually bear children, although there are additional risks to the mother and child depending upon the underlying condition.
The most common and recognizable form of dwarfism in humans (comprising 70% of cases) is achondroplasia, a genetic disorder whereby the limbs are diminutive. Growth hormone deficiency is responsible for most other cases. There are many other less common causes. Treatment of the condition depends on the underlying cause. Those with genetic disorders such as osteochondrodysplasia can sometimes be treated with surgery or physical therapy. Hormone disorders can also be treated with growth hormone therapy before the child&#x27;s growth plates fuse. Individual accommodations such as specialized furniture, are often used by people with dwarfism. Many support groups provide services to aid individuals and the discrimination they may face.
In addition to the medical aspect of the condition there are social aspects. For a person with dwarfism, height discrimination can lead to ridicule in childhood and discrimination in adulthood. In the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, and other English-speaking countries, labels that some people with dwarfism accept include &quot;dwarf&quot; (plural: &quot;dwarfs&quot;), &quot;little person&quot; (LP), or &quot;person of short stature&quot; (see terminology). Historically, the term &quot;midget&quot; was used to describe dwarfs (primarily proportionate); however, some now consider this term offensive.

==Signs and symptoms==

A defining characteristic of dwarfism is an adult height less than 2.3% of the CDC standard growth charts. There is a wide range of physical characteristics. Variations in individuals are identified by diagnosing and monitoring the underlying disorders. There may not be any complications outside adapting to their size. Short stature is a common replacement of the term &#x27;dwarfism&#x27;, especially in a medical context. Short stature is clinically defined as a height within the lowest 2.3% of those in the general population. However, those with mild skeletal dysplasias may not be affected by dwarfism. In some cases of untreated hypochondroplasia, males grow up to . Though that is short in a relative context, it does not fall into the extreme ranges of the growth charts.

Disproportionate dwarfism is characterized by shortened limbs or a shortened torso. In achondroplasia one has an average-sized trunk with short limbs and a larger forehead. Facial features are often affected and individual body parts may have problems associated with them. Spinal stenosis, ear infection, and hydrocephalus are common. In case of spinal dysostosis, one has a small trunk, with average-sized limbs. Proportionate dwarfism is marked by a short torso with short limbs, thus leading to a height that is significantly below average. There may be long periods without any significant growth. Sexual development is often delayed or impaired into adulthood. This dwarfism type is caused by an endocrine disorder and not a skeletal dysplasia.

Physical effects of malformed bones vary according to the specific disease. Many involve joint pain caused by abnormal bone alignment, or from nerve compression. Early degenerative joint disease, exaggerated lordosis or scoliosis, and constriction of spinal cord or nerve roots can cause pain and disability. Reduced thoracic size can restrict lung growth and reduce pulmonary function. Some forms of dwarfism are associated with disordered function of other organs, such as the brain or liver, sometimes severely enough to be more of an impairment than the unusual bone growth. Mental effects also vary according to the specific underlying syndrome. In most cases of skeletal dysplasia, such as achondroplasia, mental function is not impaired. However, there are syndromes which can affect the cranial structure and growth of the brain, severely impairing mental capacity. Unless the brain is directly affected by the underlying disorder, there is little to no chance of mental impairment that can be attributed to dwarfism.

The psycho-social limitations of society may be more disabling than the physical symptoms, especially in childhood and adolescence, but people with dwarfism vary greatly in the degree to which social participation and emotional health are affected.
* Social prejudice against extreme shortness may reduce social and marital opportunities.
* Numerous studies have demonstrated reduced employment opportunities. Severe shortness is associated with lower income.
* Self-esteem may decline and family relationships may be affected.
* Extreme shortness (in the range) can, if not accommodated for, interfere with activities of daily living, like driving or using countertops built for taller people. Other common attributes of dwarfism such as bowed knees and unusually short fingers can lead to back problems and difficulty in walking and handling objects.
* Children with dwarfism are particularly vulnerable to teasing and ridicule from classmates. Because dwarfism is relatively uncommon, children may feel isolated from their peers.

==Causes==

Dwarfism can result from many medical conditions, each with its own separate symptoms and causes. Extreme shortness in humans with proportional body parts usually has a hormonal cause, such as growth hormone deficiency, once called &quot;pituitary dwarfism&quot;. Achondroplasia is responsible for the majority of human dwarfism cases, followed by spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and diastrophic dysplasia.

===Achondroplasia===

The most recognizable and most common form of dwarfism in humans is achondroplasia, which accounts for 70% of dwarfism cases, and occurs in 4 to 15 out of 100,000 live births.

It produces rhizomelic short limbs, increased spinal curvature, and distortion of skull growth. In achondroplasia the body&#x27;s limbs are proportionately shorter than the trunk (abdominal area), with a larger head than average and characteristic facial features. Achondroplasia is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by the presence of an altered allele in the genome. If a pair of achondroplasia alleles are present, the result is fatal, usually perinatally. Achondroplasia is a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. In the context of achondroplasia, this mutation causes FGFR3 to become constitutively active, inhibiting bone growth.

===Growth hormone deficiency===

Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is a medical condition in which the body produces insufficient growth hormone. Growth hormone, also called somatotropin, is a polypeptide hormone which stimulates growth and cell reproduction. If this hormone is lacking, stunted or even halted growth may become apparent. Children with this disorder may grow slowly and puberty may be delayed by several years or indefinitely. Growth hormone deficiency has no single definite cause. It can be caused by mutations of specific genes, damage to the pituitary gland, Turner&#x27;s syndrome, poor nutrition, or even stress (leading to psychogenic dwarfism). Laron syndrome (growth hormone insensitivity) is another cause. Those with growth hormone issues tend to be proportionate.

===Metatropic dysplasia===
Metatropic means &quot;changing form&quot; and refers to this form of skeletal dysplasia as there is an abnormality in the growth plates. Skeletal changes continue over time and may need surgical intervention to help protect the lungs. Symptoms starting at birth may be mild or can be fatal. There are recognizable features in individuals with this genetic disorder. Some are short stature, narrow chest, &quot;facial features such as a prominent forehead, underdevelopment of the upper jaw, cheekbones and eye sockets (midface hypoplasia), and a squared-off jaw.&quot; It is considered a more severe skeletal dysplasia, but is very rare, with the exact number of those affected unknown. Prognosis is largely on a case-by-case basis depending on the severity, and life expectancy may not be impacted unless there are respiratory complications.

===Other===
Other causes of dwarfism are spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, diastrophic dysplasia, pseudoachondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, Noonan syndrome, primordial dwarfism, Cockayne syndrome, Kniest dysplasia, Turner syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), and hypothyroidism. Severe shortness with skeletal distortion also occurs in several of the mucopolysaccharidoses and other storage disorders. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism may cause proportionate, yet temporary, dwarfism. NPR2 disproportionate dwarfism was discovered recently and is caused by a mutant gene.

==Diagnosis==
Dwarfism is often diagnosed in childhood on the basis of visible symptoms. A physical examination can usually suffice to diagnose certain types of dwarfism, but genetic testing and diagnostic imaging may be used to determine the exact condition. In a person&#x27;s youth, growth charts that track height can be used to diagnose subtle forms of dwarfism that have no other striking physical characteristics.

Short stature or stunted growth during youth is usually what brings the condition to medical attention. Skeletal dysplasia is usually suspected because of obvious physical features (e.g., unusual configuration of face or shape of skull), because of an obviously affected parent, or because body measurements (arm span, upper to lower segment ratio) indicate disproportion. Bone X-rays are often key to diagnosing a specific skeletal dysplasia, but are not the sole diagnostic tool. Most children with suspected skeletal dysplasias are referred to a genetics clinic for diagnostic confirmation and genetic counseling. Since about the year 2000, genetic tests for some of the specific disorders have become available.

During an initial medical evaluation of shortness, the absence of disproportion and other clues listed above usually indicates causes other than bone dysplasias.

===Classification===

In men and women, the sole requirement for being considered a dwarf is having an adult height under and it is almost always sub-classified with respect to the underlying condition that is the cause of the short stature. Dwarfism is usually caused by a genetic variant; achondroplasia is caused by a mutation on chromosome 4. If dwarfism is caused by a medical disorder, the person is referred to by the underlying diagnosed disorder. Disorders causing dwarfism are often classified by proportionality. Disproportionate dwarfism describes disorders that cause unusual proportions of the body parts, while proportionate dwarfism results in a generally uniform stunting of the body.

Disorders that cause dwarfism may be classified according to one of hundreds of names, which are usually permutations of the following roots:
* location
** rhizomelic = root, i.e., bones of the upper arm or thigh
** mesomelic = middle, i.e., bones of the forearm or lower leg
** acromelic = end, i.e., bones of hands and feet.
** micromelic = entire limbs are shortened
* source
** chondro = of cartilage
** osteo = of bone
** spondylo = of the vertebrae
** plasia = form
** trophy = growth

Examples include achondroplasia and chondrodystrophy.

==Prevention==
Many types of dwarfism are currently impossible to prevent because they are genetically caused. Genetic conditions that cause dwarfism may be identified with genetic testing, by screening for the specific variations that result in the condition. However, due to the number of causes of dwarfism, it may be impossible to determine definitively if a child will be born with dwarfism. Dwarfism resulting from malnutrition or a hormonal abnormality may be treated with an appropriate diet or hormonal therapy. Growth hormone deficiency may be remedied via injections of human growth hormone (HGH) during early life.

==Management==
Genetic mutations of most forms of dwarfism caused by bone dysplasia cannot be altered yet, so therapeutic interventions are typically aimed at preventing or reducing pain or physical disability, increasing adult height, or mitigating psychosocial stresses and enhancing social adaptation. Forms of dwarfism associated with the endocrine system may be treated using hormonal therapy. If the cause is prepubescent hyposecretion of growth hormone, supplemental growth hormone may correct the abnormality. If the receptor for growth hormone is itself affected, the condition may prove harder to treat. Hypothyroidism is another possible cause of dwarfism that can be treated through hormonal therapy. Injections of thyroid hormone can mitigate the effects of the condition, but lack of proportion may be permanent.

Pain and disability may be ameliorated by physical therapy, braces or other orthotic devices, or by surgical procedures. The only simple interventions that increase perceived adult height are dress enhancements, such as shoe lifts or hairstyle. Growth hormone is rarely used for shortness caused by bone dysplasias, since the height benefit is typically small (less than ) and the cost high. The most effective means of increasing adult height by several inches is distraction osteogenesis, though availability is limited and the cost is high in terms of money, discomfort, and disruption of life. Most people with dwarfism do not choose this option, and it remains controversial. For other types of dwarfism, surgical treatment is not possible.

==Society and culture==

===Terminology===
The appropriate term for describing a person of particularly short stature (or with the genetic condition achondroplasia) has developed euphemistically.

The noun &quot;dwarf&quot; stems from , originally referring to a being from Germanic mythology—a dwarf—that dwells in mountains and in the earth, and is associated with wisdom, smithing, mining, and crafting. The etymology of the word &quot;dwarf&quot; is contested, and scholars have proposed varying theories about the origins of the being, including that dwarfs may have originated as nature spirits or as beings associated with death, or as a mixture of concepts. Competing etymologies include a basis in the Indo-European root (meaning ), the Indo-European root (whence modern Dutch and ), and comparisons have been made with the Old Indian &quot;dhvaras&quot; (a type of demonic being). The being may not have gained associations with small stature until a later period.

The terms &quot;little person&quot;, &quot;LP&quot; and &quot;person of short stature&quot; are the preferred terms of many of those with this disorder, and while some are uncomfortable with &quot;dwarf&quot; it remains a common term in some areas. However, the plural &quot;dwarfs&quot; as opposed to &quot;dwarves&quot; is generally preferred in the medical context, possibly because the plural &quot;dwarves&quot; was popularized by author J. R. R. Tolkien, describing a race of characters in his &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; books resembling Norse dwarfs. &quot;Midget&quot;, whose etymology indicates a &quot;tiny biting insect&quot;, came into prominence in the mid-19th century after Harriet Beecher Stowe used it in her novels &quot;Sunny Memories of Foreign Lands&quot; and &quot;Oldtown Folks&quot; where she described children and an extremely short man, respectively. Later some people of short stature considered the word to be offensive because it was the descriptive term applied to P. T. Barnum&#x27;s dwarfs used for public amusement during the freak show era. It is also not considered accurate as it is not a medical term or diagnosis, though it is sometimes used as a slang term to describe those who are particularly short, whether or not they have dwarfism.

=== Participation ===
Individuals with dwarfism are capable of actively participating in various aspects of society. They have access to education and sports, and can pursue careers, engaging in a wide range of professions.

=== Acceptance ===
Individuals with dwarfism often face prejudice and stereotypes. Research by Klein (2019) has demonstrated that awareness of the stigmatization of this group can promote full participation in society. The research by Green and Pinter (2018) in the field of humor and social psychology can provide insights to reduce stereotypes and promote a more objective perception.

=== Accommodation ===

In daily life, little people face numerous obstacles because the environment is tailored to average-sized individuals. Some little people can only use ATMs, kitchens, toilets, and sinks with aids. Low stools and step stools play a special role, as they can be used in various ways to bridge the height difference.
Stools are also useful as footrests while sitting, as the legs of short people dangle in the air when sitting on an average chair, which can be painful and uncomfortable in the long run and may hinder fine motor skills during work. 

To be mobile, some individuals use customized scooters or bicycles, as it can be problematic, depending on the type of short stature, to walk longer distances. With specially adapted vehicles, most individuals of short stature can drive without further hindrances. Generally, pedal extensions and an individually adjusted seat at the correct height are required. Some little people are tall enough to drive without pedal extensions. Usually, patients with skeletal dysplasia with limited mobility can receive allowances or grants for vehicle assistance through governmental help or rehabilitation providers.

===Dwarf sports===
Dwarfs have support and compete in sport by a number of organizations nationally and internationally. They are included in some events in the athletics at the Summer Paralympics.

The Dwarf Athletic Association of America and the Dwarf Sports Association UK provide opportunities for dwarfs to compete nationally and internationally in the Americas and Europe, respectively. The World Dwarf Games (WDG) are a multi-sport event for athletes of short stature. The WDG have been held every four years since 1993 and are the world&#x27;s largest sporting event exclusively for athletes with dwarfism. The Dwarf Sports Association UK organizes between 5 and 20 events per month for athletes with restricted growth conditions in the UK. For instance, swimming and bicycling are often recommended for people with skeletal dysplasias, since those activities put minimal pressure on the spine.

Since its early days, professional wrestling has had the involvement of dwarf athletes. &quot;Midget wrestling&quot; had its heyday in the 1950s–&#x27;70s, when wrestlers such as Little Beaver, Lord Littlebrook, and Fuzzy Cupid toured North America, and Sky Low Low was the first holder of the National Wrestling Alliance&#x27;s World Midget Championship. In the next couple of decades, more wrestlers became prominent in North America including foreign wrestlers like Japan&#x27;s Little Tokyo. Although the term is seen by some as pejorative, many past and current midget wrestlers including Hornswoggle said they take pride in the term due to its history in the industry and its marketability.

===Art and media depictions===
In art, literature, and movies, dwarfs are rarely depicted as ordinary people who are very short but rather as a species apart. Novelists, artists, and moviemakers may attach special moral or aesthetic significance to their &quot;apartness&quot; or misshapenness.

Artistic representations of dwarfism are found on Greek vases and other ancient artifacts, including ancient Egyptian art in which dwarfs are likely to have been seen as a divine manifestation, with records indicating that they were able to reach high positions in society at the time.

The ancient Hindu text &quot;Bhagavat Purana&quot; devotes nine chapters to the adventures of Vamana, a dwarf avatar of Lord Vishnu.
Depictions of dwarfism are also found in European paintings and many illustrations. Many European paintings (especially Spanish) of the 16th–19th centuries depict dwarfs by themselves or with others. In the Talmud, it is said that the second born son of the Egyptian Pharaoh of the Bible was a dwarf. Recent scholarship has suggested that ancient Egyptians held dwarfs in high esteem. Several important mythological figures of the North American Wyandot nation are portrayed as dwarfs.

As popular media has become more widespread, the number of works depicting dwarfs have increased dramatically. Dwarfism is depicted in many books, films, and TV series such as &quot;Willow&quot;, &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; (and later parodied in&quot; Austin Powers&quot;), &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; by Jonathan Swift, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;, &quot;Bad Santa&quot;, &quot;A Son of the Circus&quot;, &quot;Little People, Big World&quot;, &quot;The Little Couple&quot;, &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; (and its TV adaptation &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;), &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;The Orator&quot;, &quot;In Bruges&quot;, &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; by Günter Grass, the short-lived reality show &quot;The Littlest Groom&quot;, and the films &quot;The Station Agent&quot; and &quot;Zero&quot;.

The Animal Planet TV series &quot;Pit Boss&quot; features dwarf actor Shorty Rossi and his talent agency, &quot;Shortywood Productions&quot;, which Rossi uses to provide funding for his pit bull rescue operation, &quot;Shorty&#x27;s Rescue&quot;. Rossi&#x27;s three full-time employees, featured in the series, are little people and aspiring actors. In September 2014, Creative Business House along with Donnons Leur Une Chance, created the International Dwarf Fashion Show to raise awareness and boost self-confidence of people living with dwarfism. A number of reality television series on Lifetime, beginning with &quot;Little Women: LA&quot; in 2014, focused on showing the lives of women living with dwarfism in various cities around the United States.

<text>Wallula () is a census-designated place (CDP) in Walla Walla County, Washington, United States. The population was 179 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The Lewis and Clark Expedition reached this area April 27, 1806, on their return journey from the Pacific. The expedition spent three days at the village of Chief Yallept and his tribe of Walla Walla people (relatives of the Nez Perce), in the company of about a hundred Yakama people. Meriwether Lewis estimated the total of Native American people at around 550. There the expedition learned of an overland route to the Nez Perce homelands, which shortened their route by some eighty miles.

During David Thompson&#x27;s 1811 voyage down the Columbia River, he camped at the Snake River confluence on July 9, 1811. There he erected a pole and notice claiming the country for Great Britain and stating the intention of the North West Company to build a trading post at the site.
European settlement of the area began in 1818, when the North West Company built Fort Nez Perce at the mouth of the Walla Walla River. The location was chosen to compete with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company for the fur trade in the Pacific Northwest. That site was maintained until 1855.

The first railroad to connect Walla Walla with the Columbia River at Wallula was begun in 1871. The line, called the Walla Walla and Columbia River Railroad, was completed October 23, 1875. The line was later absorbed into the Northern Pacific Railroad. To save money, the original rails were wooden, with strap iron on the upper surface.

In 1883, the Northern Pacific completed its line from St. Paul, Minnesota, to present-day Wallula. It built a railroad bridge across the river to connect to the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company tracks along the south side of the Columbia River.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

The water gap in the Columbia River called Wallula Gap is near the settlement.

<doc id="138304" wikidata="Q1510236" url="?curid=138304" title="Acme, Washington">
<text>Acme is a rural unincorporated community and a census-designated place in Whatcom County, Washington, United States. There is a general store, post office, gas station, diner, elementary school and two churches located there. Acme is also included in, and the source-name for, a larger census-designated place (CDP). The Census Bureau no longer tracks the population for the village itself, but for the entire CDP the population was 229 at the 2020 census, down from 246 at the 2010 census.

Acme is located in the South Fork Valley between the northern Cascade Mountains and Lake Whatcom. Acme is locally known as a scenic area with a number of camping opportunities along Lake Whatcom, including the Lake Whatcom Railroad.

==History==
There are two accounts on how Acme was named.

The first states that Acme was named by Samuel Parks around 1887 after the name of a hymnal in his possession.

The second claims that in 1887, resident George Parls named the town after a local church&#x27;s newly received Acme hymn book.

Either way, the English word acme is from a Greek word meaning &quot;culmination&quot; or &quot;top or highest point&quot;.

<doc id="138305" wikidata="Q1508497" url="?curid=138305" title="Birch Bay, Washington">
<text>Birch Bay (Tsan-wuch, Say-wak) is a census-designated place (CDP) along the shore of the bay named Birch Bay in Whatcom County, Washington, United States. The population was 8,413 at the 2010 census, a 69.6% increase over the 4,961 individuals in the 2000 census. As of the 2020 census, the population was 10,115.

==History==
The original name of this place, &quot;Say-wak&quot; was given by local indigenous communities. Say-wak means &quot;people saved from a flood by building a raft.&quot; 

Captains of Spanish ships from Acapulco and San Blas (Spanish west coast ports in Mexico) were in this area in 1791 and 1792 and named it &quot;Puerto del Garzon&quot; in 1791 by captain Jose Maria Narvaez. It was then renamed Birch Bay in 1792 by Archibald Menzies, a member of the Vancouver Expedition. Vancouver&#x27;s two ships used Birch Bay as an anchorage for several days. Menzies noted a number of species of birch and gave the name to the bay.

In the 2000s, the development of condominiums and vacation homes became more prominent in Birch Bay due to high demand from wealthier clientele in the United States and Canada. A proposal to incorporate the community as a city was announced in 2023 following earlier attempts and discussion. By 2020, Birch Bay had grown to approximately 10,000 people, making it larger than all but three cities in Whatcom County.

==Geography==
Birch Bay is on the Salish Sea in northwestern Whatcom County, about south of the Canada–United States border and from Vancouver, British Columbia. The community that surrounds the bay is connected by State Route 548, a short highway that runs between two interchanges on Interstate 5 near Ferndale and in Blaine.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (25.45%) is water.

===Geology===

Birch Bay is a headland bay created by the refraction of incoming waves on the headlands that lie on either side of the bay. The headland to the north is Birch Point, and the one to the south is Point Whitehorn. The waves bend as they enter the bay and lose energy in the process. The result is a half-moon-shaped bay with a gentle sloping beach. The shoreline has been modified in past years by the implementation of perpendicular structures called groins, and riprap. Terrell Creek runs parallel along a section of the beach, eventually flowing into the bay.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 4,961 people, 2,125 households, and 1,417 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 5,105 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 92.36% White, 1.23% Asian, 1.19% Native American, 1.05% African American, 0.14% Pacific Islander, 1.91% from other races, and 2.12% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.45% of the population.

There were 2,125 households, out of which 27.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.5% were married couples living together, 9.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.3% were non-families. 26.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.33 and the average family size was 2.80.

In the CDP, the age distribution of the population shows 23.2% under the age of 18, 6.2% from 18 to 24, 27.0% from 25 to 44, 27.7% from 45 to 64, and 15.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 41 years. For every 100 females, there were 97.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.9 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $40,040, and the median income for a family was $44,280. Males had a median income of $41,198 versus $27,076 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $21,204. About 6.7% of families and 9.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 13.7% of those under age 18 and 0.9% of those age 65 or over.

<doc id="138306" wikidata="Q1144380" url="?curid=138306" title="Blaine, Washington">
<text>Blaine is a city in Whatcom County, Washington, United States. The city&#x27;s northern boundary is the Canada–U.S. border; the Peace Arch international monument straddles the border of both countries. It is the fourth largest incorporated city within the Bellingham Metropolitan Area. The population was 5,884 at the 2020 census. Since Blaine is located adjacent to the border with Canada, it is the northernmost city on Interstate 5.

==History==
The area was first settled in the mid-19th century by pioneers who established the town as a seaport for the west coast logging and fishing industries, and as a jumping off point for prospectors heading to British Columbia&#x27;s gold fields. Blaine was officially incorporated on May 20, 1890, and was named after James G. Blaine (1830−1893), who was a U.S. senator from the state of Maine, Secretary of State, and, in 1884, the unsuccessful Republican presidential candidate. The city has a &quot;turn-of-the-century&quot; theme, marked by remodeled buildings and signs resembling designs that existed during the late 19th century and early 20th century.

The world&#x27;s largest salmon cannery was operated by the Alaska Packers&#x27; Association for decades in Blaine; the cannery site has been converted to a waterfront destination resort on Semiahmoo Spit. Several saw mills once operated on Blaine&#x27;s waterfront, and much of the lumber was transported from its wharves and docks to help rebuild San Francisco following the 1906 fire there. The forests were soon logged but Blaine&#x27;s fishing industry remained strong into the second half of the 20th century. Into the 1970s Blaine was home to hundreds of commercial purse seiners and gillnetters plying the waters offshore of British Columbia, between Washington state and southeast Alaska. Blaine&#x27;s two large marinas are still home to hundreds of recreational sailboats and yachts. Nature lovers have always appreciated Blaine&#x27;s coastal location, its accessible bike and walking trails, and view of mountains and water. Birdwatchers across the continent have discovered the area&#x27;s high content of migratory birds and waterfowl: Blaine&#x27;s Drayton Harbor, Semiahmoo Spit and Boundary Bay are ranked as Important Birding Areas by the Audubon Society.

The Cains are the most notable family in Blaine&#x27;s short history, credited with its founding and achievements. At one time owning most of present-day Blaine, the Cain brothers erected the biggest store north of Seattle, a lumber and shingle mill, a hotel (largest in the state at the time), the first public wharf, and donated large public tracts of land.

Nathan Cornish and family moved to Blaine in 1889. He became mayor in 1901; his platform was &quot;twelve miles of wooden sidewalk&quot;. His daughter, Nellie Cornish, having failed to open a successful piano teaching business in Blaine, moved to Seattle, where she founded the Cornish College of the Arts in 1914, which still exists today.

On May 9, 1970, approximately 450 Canadian protestors demonstrating against the Cambodian campaign of the Vietnam War crossed the border and conducted a &quot;symbolic invasion&quot; of Blaine. Several buildings&#x27; windows were smashed, flags were torn down, and the Peace Arch was vandalized before police officers and vigilantes pushed the protestors back to the Canadian side of the border.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. Blaine&#x27;s motto is &quot;Where America Begins&quot;: the community is also known as &quot;The Gateway to the Pacific Northwest&quot;, and the &quot;Peace Arch City&quot;. All these phrases are commentaries on Blaine&#x27;s unique locale. It lies at the northernmost point of the north-south U.S. Interstate 5 and next to Drayton Harbor and Boundary Bay (the southward extension of Boundary Bay is officially named and often referred to as Semiahmoo Bay).

===Climate===
Blaine lies between the mountains east of Vancouver, the flatlands of Skagit County, Washington, the North Cascades (including Mount Baker), and the south end of Vancouver Island. Blaine has a borderline climate between mediterranean (&quot;Csb&quot;) and maritime (&quot;Cfb&quot;), which provides fairly mild weather from the rest of the Pacific Northwest. With annual precipitation of about and its milder location, Blaine enjoys more sunny days and a milder climate than neighboring communities.

===Canada–U.S. border===
Blaine is home to two main West Coast ports of entry between the United States and Canada. The Peace Arch Border Crossing, which is the northern terminus of I-5 and southern terminus of B.C. provincial Highway 99, serves as the primary passenger vehicle port of entry. The Pacific Highway Border Crossing, approximately one mile to the east, serves as the primary point of entry for heavy truck traffic, and thus is also known as the Truck Crossing. The latter is reached via Washington State Route 543 which departs I-5 on the south side of Blaine and connects at the border to B.C.&#x27;s Highway 15 (Surrey&#x27;s 176th Street) and then to the Trans-Canada Highway.

Construction of a new Land Port of Entry (LPOE) was completed by the U.S. General Services Administration in 2011. A large public art installation entitled &quot;Non-Sign II&quot; was erected near the crossing booths. The art piece is a &quot;blank space&quot; in the shape of a billboard sign, surrounded by a mass of twisted metal rods. On the Canadian side, a new Port of Entry building was constructed by the Canada Border Services Agency. It was officially opened by Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan on August 20, 2009. It was built partly to reduce delays for travelers coming to the 2010 Winter Olympics which were held in Vancouver and Whistler February 12–28, 2010.

International border intrigue has always been a part of Blaine&#x27;s ambiance. Smuggling became an underground industry in 1919 with the passage of the Volstead Act banning liquor sale and use in the United States. Rum-running and border jumping thrived along Blaine&#x27;s shared coastline with British Columbia, due in part to the area&#x27;s largest whiskey still being located on Texada Island, which is located in the northern Strait of Georgia offshore from the city of Powell River, British Columbia. This continued until Prohibition was repealed in 1933 (coincidentally, the US Congressional law which re-legalized alcohol is named the Blaine Act). In subsequent decades, the situation was reversed due to restrictive drinking and entertainment laws in British Columbia, notably a ban on Sunday drinking, which led to Blaine and its sister border towns of Point Roberts and Sumas booming with taverns and adult entertainment of various kinds. Those days are long gone and now Blaine&#x27;s retail sector consists of goods such as gasoline, dairy products and clothing outlets, as these goods are cheaper in the U.S.

In the 1990s, smuggling again reached a zenith with exports of high grade marijuana from neighboring British Columbia, and corresponding flow of cocaine and handguns from the United States into Canada. As the production of &#x27;BC Bud&#x27; grew across British Columbia, a sometimes dangerous game of cat and mouse played out along Blaine&#x27;s border with Canada. Smugglers used every technique, from backpacks to helicopter aerial drops to bring tons of the marijuana crop into the U.S., while a growing phalanx of local, state, provincial and federal law enforcement from both sides of the border sought ways to stem the tide. Following the terrorist attacks of 2001, the addition of hundreds of federal agents and millions of dollars in enforcement technology have pushed much of the smuggling activity into the rugged interior of Washington.

The International Peace Arch, dedicated September 6, 1921, by Samuel Hill, is located within Peace Arch State Park in Blaine and is occasionally used as a focal point for peaceful demonstrations and debate, such as the annual setting of crosses for each American killed so far in the Iraq War. But most of the people who visit or pass by the park each year remember it for its beauty and peaceful shoreline setting (although the beach is not officially accessible from the park).

The Interstate 5 freeway extends from the U.S./Mexico border at San Diego, northward to Canada, and terminates in Blaine at the city&#x27;s northern border. The country&#x27;s only pedestrian crosswalk to cross an Interstate freeway exists in Peace Arch State Park, the Washington portion of the binational Peace Arch Park. The Canadian side of the park, designated as Peace Arch Provincial Park, is in Douglas, the Canadian port-of-entry and part of the city of Surrey, British Columbia. The Peace Arch monument, located in the park, symbolizes lasting peace and amity between the U.S. and Canada. One innovative feature that has never been abrogated even during the days since 9/11 is that people entering the park from either side may have the unique experience of strolling to the opposite park&#x27;s boundary amid flowers, ponds, and works of art, without having to go through customs facilities. The park has been described as a place of bi-national mingling and also hosts wedding ceremonies.

In 2006, a local group called the Blaine Peace Alliance unsuccessfully solicited City Council support to formalize a sister-city relationship with Pugwash, Nova Scotia, where promotion of world peace had been an ongoing effort for 50 years. Because Pugwash affiliated itself with the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, the Council ruled such a connection would be &quot;political&quot;. Shortly thereafter, the Alliance disbanded.

Since 1937, an annual celebration known as &quot;Hands Across the Border&quot; has been held at the park, sponsored by the International Peace Arch Association. Hundreds of Scouts from the U.S. and Canada are in attendance and the highways and Ports of Entry on both sides of the border are closed for several hours for the event. There is a procession of Troops and world flags through the Peace Arch, signifying Scout unity around the world. Speeches are made by honored Scouts from Washington and British Columbia, and State, Provincial and local dignitaries attend. On February 28, 2013, after 90 years, the event&#x27;s former organizers announced that &quot;Hands Across the Border&quot; had been cancelled. However, following public support the annual program was re-established in 2015.

==Economy==
Much of Blaine&#x27;s economy is based on cross-border Canadian trade. The eastern side of the city accommodates a number of import/export warehouses, freight and courier services and gas stations serving long-haul cargo trucks. The Customs and Border Protection branch of the Department of Homeland Security operates two border inspection stations in Blaine. The Blaine Sector Headquarters of the US Border Patrol employs hundreds of federal law enforcement officers and support staff in the community.

Blaine also has a number of manufacturing companies, including Nature&#x27;s Path cereal and Totally Chocolate.

The Port of Bellingham operates a large marina in Blaine, serving a variety of pleasure craft and fishing vessels.

As Vancouver, British Columbia is just north of Blaine, across the US-Canada border and where several prime-time television series are recorded, several dozen US actors/actresses have rented houses in Blaine and commute to Vancouver rather than rent houses and apartments in Vancouver, which is much more expensive. Included series are: &quot;Once Upon A Time&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot; and &quot;Nikita&quot;. For similar reasons, a significant number of Americans who work for companies in Vancouver are living in Blaine.

The United States Consulate in Vancouver has a Blaine address for mail from the U.S. Several mail service companies have opened branches in Blaine, targeting Canadian residents looking to avoid cross-border shipping costs. The local industry grew during the rise of e-commerce in the early 2000s and the city set up a sales tax that earns $1.7 million in annual revenue.

Blaine had a small airport, which was popular with light aircraft owners for its low fuel prices and because it had less fog than other nearby airports. The runway measured . The Blaine city government operated automated fuel pumps. In the spring of 2006 the city government removed several tall trees south of the runway as a safety precaution. Then in 2007, the City Council voted to close the airport before the end of 2008. The airport was officially closed on December 31, 2008. The land upon which the airport rests is adjacent to a shopping center and light industrial park. The area is now zoned for mixed use development, including light industrial manufacturing and commercial.

==Education==
The Blaine School District has five public schools that serves the city as well as adjacent unincorporated communities, including Birch Bay and Point Roberts. The largest share of school services is consolidated on a campus in central Blaine, which has facilities for approximately 2,100 students, including Blaine High School, Blaine Middle School, and Blaine Elementary School. Students from the small nearby exclave of Point Roberts above 3rd grade are bused through the border to Blaine to attend school.

==Transportation==
Blaine is at the north end of Interstate 5 (I-5), the main north–south freeway in the West Coast states. The freeway terminates at the Peace Arch Border Crossing and has a spur route, State Route 543, that serves the Pacific Highway Border Crossing to the east; commercial vehicles such as trucks and buses are required to use the eastern crossing. Another state highway, State Route 548, travels south from Blaine to Birch Bay and the Cherry Point Refinery. The city is also served by Whatcom Transportation Authority buses that connect it to Ferndale and Bellingham.

The Great Northern Railway opened a passenger and freight depot serving Blaine in 1909, shortly after completing construction of its waterfront railroad. Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Pacific International&quot; began serving the station in 1972 and operated daily trains that stopped there until 1981. Passengers were initially required to disembark from the train at Blaine station to use a customs station until 1974, when processing was switched to on-board agents. Restoration of the depot and Amtrak service on the modern &quot;Cascades&quot; service has been proposed in the 21st century to serve Blaine and areas of Metro Vancouver.

Custer was named in 1886 after Albert W. Custer, an early settler and the first storekeeper and postmaster of the town. Originally the town was located at the intersection of the current Valley View and Bay Roads. In 1890-1892 the town moved to the current location with the coming of the railroad.

In December 2020, a train derailment led to the spill of approximately 30,000 gallons of oil. Most of the oil burned or evaporated, but possibly up to 8,000 gallons of a type of crude oil could not be recovered. Within weeks, air quality was considered normal and soil mitigation was completed, but the testing of groundwater and ongoing cleanup has been determined to take several years.

==Notable people==
Country singer Loretta Lynn was a resident of Custer in the 1950s and early 1960s at the start of her legendary career.

<doc id="138309" wikidata="Q1502658" url="?curid=138309" title="Everson, Washington">
<text>Everson is a city in Whatcom County, Washington, United States. The population was 2,888 at the time of the 2020 census. It is the fifth Largest city within the Bellingham Metropolitan Area.

Everson and the nearby city of Nooksack lie near the foothills of the Cascade mountains in Northwest Washington. Located on the banks of the Nooksack River, the businesses support the surrounding farms and logging industries. The valley is heavily influenced by Dutch settlers who established dairy farms on the fertile flood prone land. Fruit orchards and berry fields also play an important part of the town&#x27;s economy.

The town&#x27;s small business district provides all the basic services. There are restaurants, a pharmacy and grocery store, an auto-repair shop, and agricultural supply stores. The city park is located a 1/2 block south off the W. Main St. and Riverside Park is on the banks of the Nooksack River.

Throughout the year, the area hosts small festivals in town or in the surrounding area, including a summer festival and harvest festival.

==History==
The site of Everson was originally home to a settlement of the Lummi nation. A major traditional village with its own large communal smokehouse, it was called Kwánech (&quot;lots -- at the bottom,&quot; referring either to two fish traps at Popehómy or to a shallow area in the river at this site). Everson was later named to honor a local pioneer, Ever Everson, the first white settler north of the Nooksack River. Everson was officially incorporated on May 4, 1929.

In February 2009, a citizens group and local officials proposed consolidating Everson and Nooksack into a single city with a combined population of 3,819 (2010 census). The neighboring cities shared several municipal services at the time, and a combined government would provide cost savings and advantages in grant writing. The &quot;Bellingham Herald&quot; compared the merger to that of the four towns that formed Bellingham in 1903. Names for the proposed new city included &quot;Nooksack Valley&quot;. The proposal was dropped in May following a unanimous vote by the Nooksack City Council to not move forward based on public feedback.

<text>Lynden is a city in Whatcom County, Washington, United States. It is located 15 miles (24 km) north of Bellingham, the county seat and principal city of the Bellingham Metropolitan Area. It is the second largest city in Whatcom County. The city is approximately south of the Canada–U.S. border. 

The city is located along the Nooksack River and State Route 539. The population of Lynden was at the 2020 census. The city is also home to the annual Northwest Washington Fair.

==History==

Lynden was founded in 1870 by Phoebe Judson and her husband, Holden, on the lands of the indigenous Nooksack people, who referred to the area as &quot;&quot;. Judson named the settlement&#x27;s post office in 1893 after the riverside town in &quot;&quot;, a poem by Thomas Campbell. According to her book, &quot;A Pioneer&#x27;s Search for an Ideal Home&quot;, Judson changed the spelling of &quot;Linden&quot; to be more visually appealing. Lynden was officially incorporated as a city on March 16, 1891. A statue of Judson at the intersection of Front and 6th Street was dedicated in 2017.

The city lies in a broad valley formed by the Nooksack River, which empties into nearby Bellingham Bay. The valley&#x27;s forests were logged in the 1870s by the first wave of American settlers and the clearing of log jams on the Nooksack River at the end of the decade opened more land to farming. The first road connecting to Whatcom (now Bellingham) was completed in 1875 and railroads reached Lynden a decade later. The region&#x27;s raspberry, strawberry, and blueberry farms emerged after World War I alongside the dairy and poultry industries.

The region saw significant Dutch immigration in the early and mid-20th century and the establishment of Calvinist churches and Dutch language schools. The city began promoting its Dutch heritage in the 1980s, including the springtime Holland Days festival and a Sinterklaas celebration in December. Several building along Front Street were renovated with Dutch designs and businesses were renamed to match with &quot;Dutch&quot; names and products. Lynden retained its Dutch churches—numbering 28 by 1995—and many businesses voluntarily closed their stores on Sundays. By 2010, the city&#x27;s population had grown to nearly 12,000 and only 30 percent of Lynden residents claimed Dutch ancestry.

In 2005, a drug smuggling tunnel was discovered in Lynden, built by a band of Canadian smugglers in the basement of a residence north of Lynden along the Canada–U.S. border. At the time, this was the only known drug tunnel along the border.

The first time that a presumptive presidential nominee of a U.S. major political party came to Lynden during a general election year was in May 2016, when Donald Trump visited the city. The rally was originally planned to take place at Boeing Field in Seattle, but was relocated to Lynden after the permits were allegedly denied. The rally drew &quot;thousands&quot; of people and protestors outside of the venue; over $129,000 in extra policing and security costs were attributed to the event.

Due to the town&#x27;s large population of those who attend or are members of Lynden&#x27;s many churches, the town has had a long tradition of most businesses closing on Sunday.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

Lynden is served by two state highways: State Route 539, which travels north to the Canadian border and south to Bellingham; and State Route 546, which travels east towards Sumas. The Whatcom Transportation Authority provides bus service between Lynden and Cordata Station in Bellingham. The city is also connected via a short branch of the BNSF Railway system, traveling east to a junction with the Sumas Subdivision.

The city is home to Lynden Municipal Airport (Jansen Field), located between Benson and Depot roads, with private residences connected to the taxiways. The Port of Bellingham proposed a takeover of the airport in the early 1980s to support local cropdusting operations, but abandoned their plans due to its proximity to the town, which disqualified it from receiving federal matching funds for improvements.

<text>Nooksack ( ) is a city in Whatcom County, Washington, United States, south of the border with Canada. The population was 1,471 at the 2020 census.

Nooksack shares Nooksack Valley School District with the nearby Sumas and Everson. State Route 9 runs through Nooksack.

==History==
Nooksack was officially incorporated on December 6, 1912, and experienced much growth in its early years. It had a rail station, connecting it to the national train network. However, serious fires in the town in the early 20th century caused most of the growth to halt.

A merger between Nooksack and neighboring Everson into a single city was proposed by a citizens group in February 2009 with support from local officials. Names for the proposed new city included &quot;Nooksack Valley&quot;. The proposal was dropped in May following a unanimous vote by the Nooksack City Council to not move forward based on public feedback.

Noosack lacks its own ZIP code due to a decision by the U.S. Postal Service in 1992 to station the postmaster in Everson, forcing the two cities to share ZIP code 98247. As a result, the city was found to have lost sales tax revenue that was instead distributed to Everson based on the ZIP code.

<text>Sudden Valley is a census-designated place (CDP) just outside of Bellingham in Whatcom County, Washington. The population was 6,354 at the 2020 census, down from 6,441 at the 2010 census.

Sudden Valley is the second-largest homeowner association in western Washington, with over 7,000 residents.

==History==

The Community Association of Sudden Valley began as &quot;the Ranch&quot;. The original owner of the area was Banning Austin. In 1949, Austin sold the land to Glen and Betty Corning, who named it &quot;the Ranch&quot; and lived there with their children until in 1968 they sold 1,200 acres of property for $1.8 million. The new owner was Ken Sanwick of Sudden Valley Inc. Sanwick envisioned the land as &quot;Sudden Valley Undevelopment&quot; and wanted to preserve the natural surroundings while still incorporating homes into the wilderness. By 1969, the County Commissioners approved the first plan for 158 lots west of Lake Whatcom Boulevard. The first property owner was Mae Schatz, who bought Division 1 Lot 112 in May 1969.

In the 1970s, the Valley changed ownership a few times. SunMark Inc. bought out the Sanwick Corporation in 1973, and in 1975 Continental Mortgage Investors took over from SunMark as the developer. This was short-lived, as CMI declared bankruptcy not long after. In December 1976, ownership and control was transferred to the newly named Sudden Valley Community Association. The owner of SunMark, Roger Ufkes, who happened to be the son of the first property owner, formed the original Board of Directors for the new Community Association. Ufkes served on the Board for two years in the early 1970s and is credited for urging property owners to buy the golf course and all its subsidiaries for $1.4 million. The one‐time assessment fee of $4,000 was voted on and passed by the residents. From this point on, the SVCA held the title to all the roads, parks, greenbelt, recreation facilities, marina, airstrip, and the country club. Sudden Valley was well on its way to becoming the community it is today.

Ever since its conception in the late 1960s, over 7,000 residents, plus an abundance of wildlife call it home. Sudden Valley offers activities for all ages and abilities, including a marina, library, parks, playgrounds, miles of hiking trails, and an 18-hole golf course designed by the architect Ted Robinson.

The community center recreation area includes a state‐of‐the‐art fitness center and an outdoor 25 yard swimming pool. A &quot;quiet pool&quot; is also available near the library.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 4,165 people, 1,675 households, and 1,185 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 668.8 people per square mile (258.1/km2).

<text>Sumas () is a city in Whatcom County, Washington, United States. It had a population of 1,583 as of the 2020 census. Sumas is located adjacent to the Canada–U.S. border and borders the city of Abbotsford, British Columbia. The Sumas–Huntingdon port of entry at the north end of State Route 9 operates 24 hours a day. Sumas shares Nooksack Valley School District with the cities of Nooksack and Everson. It is the northernmost settlement on Washington State Route 9.

==History==
The area was home to the Nooksack Indians in the millennia prior to the arrival of the first permanent settler Robert Johnson in 1872. 
 It was called &quot;Sumas&quot; meaning &quot;land without trees&quot; or &quot;big flat opening.&quot; It is derived from a Cowichan tribe who also resided in the region.

Originally called &quot;Sumas City,&quot; the town was officially incorporated on June 18, 1891. A post office with that name has been in operation since 1897.

The town was a railroad hub and briefly supported the Mount Baker Gold Rush, with some gold mining operations still ongoing in the area such as at Lone Jack Mine. It was also known for a large rodeo in the early 20th Century, the &quot;Sumas Roundup.&quot;

The area around Sumas drains into the Fraser River in Canada, in a broad floodplain. Floods from the Nooksack and Fraser rivers have been recorded ever since the area was settled. Although not the largest flood to have occurred prior to 1990, the November 10 flood received notoriety as it caused millions of dollars in damage.

On November 15, 2021, another regional flood event resulted in catastrophic flooding in Sumas. Approximately 85 percent of homes in the city were damaged and hundreds of residents were rescued after a partial evacuation.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

Because of the limits of technology when the border with Canada was surveyed, the border west of the Cascade Range lies above the 49th parallel; the most extreme offset (three city blocks) is at Sumas, which is thus the northernmost incorporated place in the contiguous United States.

<doc id="138322" wikidata="Q1509984" url="?curid=138322" title="Colfax, Washington">
<text>Colfax is a city in and the county seat of Whitman County, Washington, United States. The population was 2,782 at the 2020 census, making Colfax the second largest city in Whitman County behind Pullman. It is situated amidst wheat-covered hills in a valley at the confluence of the north and south forks of the Palouse River. U.S. Route 195, which forms the town&#x27;s main street, intersects with State Route 26 at the north end of town; in the past, Colfax also lay at the junction of three major railway lines. It is part of the Pullman–Moscow combined statistical area. It was named after Schuyler Colfax, the Vice President of the United States from 1869 to 1873.

== History ==


Palouse Indians were the first known human inhabitants of the Colfax area. White settlers arrived in the summer of 1870 and soon built a sawmill. A flour mill and other businesses followed, and Colfax soon grew into a prosperous town. Originally, pioneer citizen Jared Berarducci called the settlement &quot;Belleville&quot; in honor of his girlfriend; when he found a new love, he changed the town&#x27;s name to Colfax, for vice president Schuyler Colfax.

Colfax was officially incorporated on November 29, 1873. In 1889–90, the town vied with several other finalists to become the site of a new state agricultural college, present-day Washington State University. The honor ultimately fell to nearby Pullman, southeast.

The early history of Colfax was marred by prominent lynchings in 1894 and 1898. The city incurred significant flooding in 1910 in early March.

Until passed by Pullman at the 1930 census, Colfax was the largest city in the county.

==Geography==
Colfax is located in southeastern Washington and the nearest cities are Spokane, Pullman, Moscow, and Lewiston/Clarkston. The area is geologically interesting, lying in the midst of the fertile Palouse country in the middle of the Columbia River Plateau, with the Rocky Mountains to the east, the Channeled Scablands to the west, and the Snake River to the south.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.
The Palouse River, confined for flood control to a concrete bed that reduces it to an eighteen-inch-wide stream during the dry season, runs through the middle of town, parallel to Main Street.

Colfax has a four-season continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dsb&quot;), with hot, dry summers, cold winters, and a rainy season that generally runs from autumn til spring. The annual rainfall averages less than a year. This climate, together with the deep, rich Palouse topsoil, makes for near-ideal wheat growing conditions.

===Tourist attractions===
* The Codger Pole is a chainsaw-carved monument by master carver Jonathan LaBenne. It is located on Main Street and commemorates a 1988 rematch, 50 years after the original 1938 game, between archrival football teams from Colfax High School and St. John. At tall, it is the largest sculpture of its type in the world, and consists of portraits, carved into five upended red cedar logs, of the 51 players involved. The players are shown in old age but are wearing the football uniforms of the thirties. The Codger Pole was recently renovated as of May 2016. It is located at the intersection of Main and Rock Streets. 
* Downtown Colfax Downtown Colfax is a National Register Historic District consisting of a rich collection of historic architecture ranging from the 1890s to the 1930s. The Downtown District boundaries are Upton Street to the north, Stevens Street to the south, Mill Street to the east, and the Palouse River to the west. 
* Former St. Ignatius Hospital — This location served as a hospital for central and northern Whitman County from 1892 to 1968. The hospital was relocated in 1968 and the old building was used as a nursing facility until its abandonment in 2002 after a water main broke on the upper floors in winter. In 2015, the hospital was opened for public tours, based on claims that the site is haunted. According to a 2017 report, the tours earned over $30,000 between 2015 and 2016, the proceeds of which go to the Colfax Chamber of Commerce.
* The Perkins House, on Perkins Avenue, is a meticulously restored Victorian home built in 1886. The original owner was James Perkins, a leading pioneer citizen. The Perkins family occupied the home until 1968, by which time it was sadly dilapidated and slated for demolition. In 1970, the Whitman County Historical Society assumed ownership and began restoring the house, which is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Behind the house is a log cabin, built in 1870, where Perkins lived for sixteen years. This cabin is the oldest standing structure in Whitman County. The house is open for tours from May to September, on Thursdays and Saturdays. The house is now home of the Colfax Chamber of Commerce and Colfax Downtown Association and is open from 8 AM to 5 PM Monday thru Friday and Saturdays.

<text>Colton is a town in Whitman County, Washington, United States. The population was 401 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Colton was first settled in 1879 by J.A. Cole, and was founded in 1882 by J.B. Stanley. Colton was incorporated in 1890; however, the incorporation documents were not recorded until 1893.

Plans for the formation of Colton were made in 1879. Several residents of the town of Uniontown, which was settled a few years earlier, had grown dissatisfied with the proprietor of that town. In June 1879, the town of Colton was surveyed and platted on the 480-acre farm of Gregor Kosher. That month L.J. Wolford moved his hotel to Colton and Chris Adamson moved his blacksmith shop to the new town. Dr. Cole erected the first new building on the corner of Steptoe and Broadway (now Main Street); J.B. Standley moved his small supply of merchandise into the new building. The town took its name from the first three letters of Cole, and the last three from Clinton, a son of Mr. Wolford, whose family was the first to live in Colton.

On October 10, 1879, John Standley was appointed postmaster and opened a post office in his own store. During the summer of 1880, a petition was granted by the county government at Asotin to separate Colton from the school district of Uniontown. The first school was opened in the Cole Building. Mrs. Viola Flowers was the first teacher.

Colton was a filming location for country artist Kenny Chesney in his 1995 hit song &quot;Me and You&quot;.

==Notable natives==
* Mike Kramer, former head football coach at Eastern Washington, Montana State, and Idaho State
* Albert Rooks, captain of &quot;USS Houston&quot; (CA-30), posthumous Medal of Honor recipient

<text>Novodevichy Cemetery () is a cemetery in Moscow. It lies next to the southern wall of the 16th-century Novodevichy Convent, which is the city&#x27;s third most popular tourist site.

== History ==
The cemetery was designed by Ivan Mashkov and inaugurated in 1898. Its importance dates from the 1930s, when the necropolises of the medieval Muscovite monasteries (Simonov, Danilov, Donskoy) were scheduled for demolition. Only the Donskoy survived the Joseph Stalin era relatively intact. The remains of many famous Russians buried in other abbeys, such as Nikolai Gogol and Sergey Aksakov, were disinterred and reburied at the Novodevichy.

A 19th-century necropolis within the walls of the Novodevichy convent, which contained the graves of about 2000 Russian noblemen and university professors, also underwent reconstruction. The vast majority of graves were destroyed. It was at that time that the remains of Anton Chekhov were moved outside the monastery walls. His grave served as the kernel of the so-called &quot;cherry orchard&quot; – a section of the cemetery which contains the graves of Konstantin Stanislavski and the leading actors of his company.

== Interments ==

During the Soviet Union, burial in the Novodevichy Cemetery was second in prestige only to burial in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. Among the Soviet leaders, Nikita Khrushchev and Mikhail Gorbachev would be buried there. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the Kremlin Wall is no longer used for burials and the Novodevichy Cemetery is used for only the most symbolically significant burials. In 1997, former premier Nikolai Tikhonov was buried in the cemetery at state expense (since he didn&#x27;t have any money of his own). In April 2007, within one week both the first President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin and cellist Mstislav Rostropovich were buried there.

Today, the cemetery holds the tombs of Russian authors, musicians, playwrights, and poets, as well as famous actors, political leaders, and scientists. More than 27,000 are buried at Novodevichy. There is scant space for more burials. A new national cemetery is under construction in Mytishchi north of Moscow. Notable burials include Dmitry Shostakovich, Sergei Prokofiev and Anton Chekhov.

The cemetery has a park-like ambience, dotted with small chapels and large sculpted monuments. It is divided into the old (Divisions 1–4), new (Divisions 5–8) and newest (Divisions 9–11) sections; maps are available at the cemetery office.

<text>LaCrosse is a rural small town in Whitman County, Washington, United States. The population was 297 at the 2020 census.

==History==
With the completion in 1888 of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company (O.R. &amp; N) railroad line between Riparia and LaCrosse, George Dawson and his wife built a shack constructed from railroad ties. By 1889, LaCrosse had a population of 12. The first real store was constructed in 1899 by Tom Shobe. The town was named for LaCrosse, Wisconsin, to match with nearby Winona (named for the Minnesota town), by settlers from the Midwest.

LaCrosse was incorporated on February 19, 1917. Beginning in the 1980s, many farmers in the area surrounding LaCrosse opted to enroll in the federal Conservation Reserve Program and leave their lands unused for agriculture. The loss of business is cited as one factor in the town&#x27;s population decline. A community benefit group formed in 2012 to fund revitalization projects and lure new businesses to replace closed services; the lone grocery store in LaCrosse closed in the 2000s and was followed by the town&#x27;s hardware store a few years later. LaCrosse also enrolled in the state government&#x27;s &quot;Washington Main Street&quot; program to advertise its historic downtown.

<doc id="138329" wikidata="Q1506099" url="?curid=138329" title="Lamont, Washington">
<text>Lamont is a town in Whitman County, Washington, United States. The population was 79 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Lamont was officially incorporated on October 22, 1910. The town was named for former vice president of the Northern Pacific Railway, Daniel Lamont. Lamont was initially founded as a terminal of the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway, a joint venture of the Jim Hill controlled railroads, Northern Pacific and Great Northern Railways. Lamont is on the Pasco-Spokane extension of the SP&amp;S. The terminal included a depot, yard, 22 stall roundhouse and locomotive servicing facilities. These facilities included water and oil tanks for SP&amp;S steam locomotives, and a 6 pocket coal dock for Northern Pacific Rwy steam locomotives. Crews from Spokane and Pasco would work to Lamont and lay over before working back home again. But the railroad shortly reconsidered the remote outpost of Lamont as a terminal, and when the roundhouse burned in 1913, crews started working through between Pasco and Spokane.

Trains still stopped at Lamont for fuel and water. In fact in the midst of the World War II, a steel coal dock from the Great Northern in Montana was moved to Lamont to replace the aging wooden dock in 1944. Steam locomotives last passed through Lamont on June 22, 1956, with diesel-electric locomotives hauling the trains thereafter. Fueling facilities for the diesel locomotives had been constructed at Lamont after WWII, but were abandoned in 1957 when they began to fuel in Pasco.

Lamont contributed a healthy amount of traffic to the railroad in the form of grain and livestock over the years. The grain elevators still stand as a landmark in town. In 1970 the &quot;Hill Lines&quot;; Great Northern Railway, Northern Pacific Railway, Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railway, and the Spokane, Portland &amp; Seattle Railway all merged to form the Burlington Northern Railroad. After the merger, the SP&amp;S and NP lines between Pasco and Spokane were used like double track, with heavy lumber traffic running east over the easier grades of the former SP&amp;S and westbound traffic on the former NP. But as export grain business began to surge in the late 1970s, the direction was flipped and the heavy grain trains began running west over the former SP&amp;S through Lamont. Following the bad recession of the early 1980s, BN began to look at ways to reduce the amount of its track in Washington State. The former SP&amp;S line didn&#x27;t have much online business, and had issues with rockfall on the south end and flooding on the north end. In the mid 1980s, BN upgraded the former NP between Spokane and Pasco and moved all the through trains off the former SP&amp;S in 1987. In 1991 the track was removed and the State of Washington obtained the former railroad line as a trail. Some remains of the roundhouse and service facilities still remain.

<text>Pullman is the most populous city in Whitman County, located in southeastern Washington within the Palouse region of the Pacific Northwest. The population was 32,901 at the 2020 census, and estimated to be 32,508 in 2022. Originally founded as Three Forks, the city was renamed after industrialist George Pullman in 1884.

Pullman is noted as a fertile agricultural area known for its many miles of rolling hills and the production of wheat and legumes. It is home to Washington State University, a public research land-grant university, and the international headquarters of Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories. Pullman is from Moscow, Idaho, home to the University of Idaho, and is served by the Pullman–Moscow Regional Airport.

==History==
In 1876, about five years after European-American settlers established Whitman County on November 29, 1871, Bolin Farr arrived in Pullman. He camped at the confluence of Dry Flat Creek and Missouri Flat Creek on the bank of the Palouse River. Within the year, Dan McKenzie and William Ellsworth arrived to stake claims for adjoining land. They named the first post office here as Three Forks. In the spring of 1881, Orville Stewart opened a general store and Bolin Farr platted about of his land for a town.

Pullman was incorporated on April 11, 1888, with a population of about 250–300 people. It was originally named Three Forks, after the three small rivers that converge there: Missouri Flat Creek, Dry Fork, and the South Fork of the Palouse River. In 1884, Dan McKenzie and Charles Moore (of Moscow) replatted the site and named it for American industrialist George Pullman.

On March 28, 1890, the Washington State Legislature established the state&#x27;s land grant college, but did not designate a location. Pullman leaders were determined to secure the new college and offered of land for its campus. Idaho Territory had established its land grant college in 1889; the University of Idaho was to be in neighboring Moscow. On April 18, 1891, the site selection commission appointed by Washington&#x27;s governor chose Pullman. On January 13, 1892, the institution opened with 59 students under the name Washington Agricultural College and School of Science. It was renamed the State College of Washington in 1905, more commonly known as &quot;Washington State College,&quot; and became Washington State University in 1959.

In 1961, Pullman became a non-chartered code city under the mayor–council form of government. The city has an elected mayor with an elected seven-member council and an appointed administrative officer, the city administrator.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city of Pullman has a total area of , all land. The city is in the eastern part of Whitman County in southeastern Washington, approximately south of Spokane and north of Lewiston, Idaho.

The city is situated across several loess hills which characterize the Palouse Prairie, formed from windblown sediment over an estimated period of over one million years. This prairie region, the Palouse, is noteworthy for its fertile rolling hills where winter and spring wheat, barley, canola, lentils, and peas are grown. These hills provide a variety of elevations across the city, from above sea level. Downtown Pullman is situated in a valley between these hills. Within the Pullman city limits, the Missouri Flat Creek and Paradise Creek both join the South Fork of the Palouse River. Pullman sits in the watersheds of the Snake River and the Columbia River.

Pullman is situated across four major hills which divide the city into nearly equal quarters. These are:

* Military Hill, north of the Palouse River and west of North Grand Avenue
* Pioneer Hill, south of Main Street and the downtown area, and east of South Grand Avenue
* Sunnyside Hill, south of Davis Way and west of South Grand Avenue
* College Hill, north of Main Street and east of North Grand Avenue

Military Hill is named for the Pullman Military College that opened its doors in 1891 and burned down in 1893.

===Climate===
Pullman has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;). This climate is typified by hot, dry summers followed by cold, wet winters with short transitional seasons in between. Due to the rain shadow effect of the Cascade Range to its west, clear skies occur regularly throughout the year and rainfall is drastically less frequent in comparison to cities west of the mountains. Clouds of any variety are especially scant between June and September, which contributes to a diurnal temperature variation that is much higher during the summer compared to winter. Pullman has an annual average of of precipitation.

==Demographics==
In 2011, &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; selected Pullman as the &quot;Best Place to Raise Kids&quot; in Washington. Factors included affordability, safety, a family-friendly lifestyle, the quality of Pullman High School, the presence of Washington State University, and the natural environment of the area.

<text>Uniontown is a town in Whitman County, Washington, United States. The population was 389 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Uniontown was first settled in 1867 by Thomas Freeborn Montgomery, who had travelled west in order to escape the violence of the American Civil War in 1863. Montgomery filed for a homestead claim in 1874, and obtained a post office for Uniontown in 1878. Agreement could not be reached on a town name until the following year, when Joseph Cataldo, a Jesuit priest and missionary, suggested the name &quot;Uniontown&quot; after the similarly-named creek and flat nearby. Montgomery had a difficult personality, which led to numerous conflicts with Uniontown businessmen. As a result, several of these businesses relocated three miles north to the neighboring rival town of Colton. Despite this, Montgomery remained active in the real estate industry in Uniontown until his passing in 1883, which was allegedly the result of a dispute that turned deadly on December 8 of that year. Uniontown was incorporated in 1890.

==Churches==

===Saint Boniface Catholic Church===

The vast majority of the early settlers of Uniontown were primarily Swiss and German immigrants who practiced Roman Catholicism. The first Catholic Church in Uniontown was built out of wood in 1879, the same year that Uniontown was officially founded. Father Anton Joehren, the local Catholic priest, played a constructive role in the early history of Uniontown, although like founder Thomas Montgomery, Joehren’s difficult nature often led to disputes. In 1888, he began plans to construct a grand brick and stone church, but construction ceased in 1893 when a dispute arose between the priest and some parishioners, resulting in only a foundation being laid. Friction with Fr. Joehren also led to the Benedictine Sisters relocating from Uniontown to Colton in 1894 and ultimately establishing the St. Gertrude Monastery in Cottonwood, Idaho in 1906. Following Fr. Joehren&#x27;s removal, a new priest oversaw the congregation&#x27;s construction of the current church, St. Boniface Church, which was completed in the spring of 1905, and consecrated in 1910, making it the first to be consecrated in the state of Washington. The church was designed by Herman Preusse and Julius Zittel and is built out of bricks in the Romanesque style, with two towers flanking the façade, and a front gable topped by a seven-foot statue of the Blessed Mother. The church retains much of its original pre-Vatican II appearance, including original stained-glass windows, altar rails, numerous statues, five altars, and numerous frescos. The church has resisted all attempts and proposals to modernize the interior and has insisted on keeping it as is, the only allowed noticeable change being the installment of an altar to celebrate the Novus Ordo facing the people.

===Uniontown Community Church===
There is also a small, non-denominational Christian, protestant church that is maintained by its congregants.
