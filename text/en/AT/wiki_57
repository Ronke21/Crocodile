<text>A starter (also self-starter, cranking motor, or starter motor) is a device used to rotate (crank) an internal-combustion engine so as to initiate the engine&#x27;s operation under its own power. Starters can be electric, pneumatic, or hydraulic. The starter can also be another internal-combustion engine in the case, for instance, of very large engines, or diesel engines in agricultural or excavation applications.

Internal combustion engines are feedback systems, which, once started, rely on the inertia from each cycle to initiate the next cycle. In a four-stroke engine, the third stroke releases energy from the fuel, powering the fourth (exhaust) stroke and also the first two (intake, compression) strokes of the next cycle, as well as powering the engine&#x27;s external load. To start the first cycle at the beginning of any particular session, the first two strokes must be powered in some other way than from the engine itself. The starter motor is used for this purpose and it is not required once the engine starts running and its feedback loop becomes self-sustaining.
== History ==

Before the advent of the starter motor, engines were started by various methods including wind-up springs, gunpowder cylinders, and human-powered techniques such as a removable crank handle which engaged the front of the crankshaft, pulling on an airplane propeller, or pulling a cord that was wound around an open-face pulley.

The hand-crank method was commonly used to start engines, but it was inconvenient, difficult, and dangerous. The behavior of an engine during starting is not always predictable. The engine can kick back, causing sudden reverse rotation. Many manual starters included a one-directional slip or release provision so that once engine rotation began, the starter would disengage from the engine. In the event of a kickback, the reverse rotation of the engine could suddenly engage the starter, causing the crank to unexpectedly and violently jerk, possibly injuring the operator. For cord-wound starters, a kickback could pull the operator towards the engine or machine, or swing the starter cord and handle at high speed around the starter pulley. Even though cranks had an overrun mechanism, when the engine started, the crank could begin to spin along with the crankshaft and potentially strike the person cranking the engine. Additionally, care had to be taken to retard the spark in order to prevent backfiring; with an advanced spark setting, the engine could &quot;kick back&quot; (run in reverse), pulling the crank with it, because the overrun safety mechanism works in one direction only.

Although users were advised to cup their fingers and thumb under the crank and pull up, it felt natural for operators to grasp the handle with the fingers on one side, the thumb on the other. Even a simple backfire could result in a broken thumb; it was possible to end up with a broken wrist, a dislocated shoulder or worse. Moreover, increasingly larger engines with higher compression ratios made hand cranking a more physically demanding endeavour.

The first electric starter was installed on an Arnold, an adaptation of the Benz Velo, built in 1896 in East Peckham, England, by electrical engineer H. J. Dowsing.

In 1903, Clyde J. Coleman invented and patented the first electric starter in America .
In 1911, Charles F. Kettering, with Henry M. Leland, of Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company (DELCO), invented and filed for an electric starter in America. (Kettering had replaced the hand crank on NCR&#x27;s cash registers with an electric motor five years earlier.)

One aspect of the invention lay in the realization that a relatively small motor, driven with higher voltage and current than would be feasible for continuous operation, could deliver enough power to crank the engine for starting. At the voltage and current levels required, such a motor would burn out in a few minutes of continuous operation, but not during the few seconds needed to start the engine. The starters were first installed on the Cadillac Model Thirty in 1912, with the same system being adopted by Lanchester later that year. These starters also worked as generators once the engine was running, a concept that is now being revived in hybrid vehicles.

Although the electric starter motor was to come to dominate the car market, in 1912, there were several competing types of starter, with the Adams, S.C.A.T. and Wolseley cars having direct air starters, and Sunbeam introducing an air starter motor with similar approach to that used for the Delco and Scott-Crossley electrical starter motors (i.e. engaging with a toothed ring on the flywheel). The Star and Adler cars had spring motors (sometimes referred to as clockwork motors), which used the energy stored in a spring driving through a reduction gear. If the car failed to start, the starter handle could be used to wind up the spring for a further attempt.

One of the innovations on the first Dodge car, the Model 30-35 at its introduction in 1914 was an electric starter and electric lighting with a 12-volt system (against the six volts that was usual at the time) as a standard fitment on what was a relatively low-priced car. The Dodge used a combined starter-generator unit, with a direct current dynamo permanently coupled by gears to the engine&#x27;s crankshaft. A system of electrical relays allowed this to be driven as a motor to rotate the engine for starting, and once the starter button was released the controlling switchgear returned the unit to operation as a generator. Because the starter-generator was directly coupled to the engine it did not need a method of engaging and disengaging the motor drive. It thus suffered negligible mechanical wear and was virtually silent in operation. The starter-generator remained a feature of Dodge cars until 1929. The disadvantage of the design was that, as a dual-purpose device, the unit was limited in both its power as a motor and its output as a generator, which became a problem as engine size and electrical demands on cars increased. Controlling the switch between motor and generator modes required dedicated and relatively complex switchgear which was more prone to failure than the heavy-duty contacts of a dedicated starter motor. While the starter-generator dropped out of favour for cars by the 1930s, the concept was still useful for smaller vehicles and was taken up by the German firm SIBA Elektrik which built similar system intended mostly for use on motorcycles, scooters, economy cars (especially those with small-capacity two-stroke engines), and marine engines. These were marketed under the &#x27;Dynastart&#x27; name. Since motorcycles usually had small engines and limited electrical equipment, as well as restricted space and weight, the Dynastart was a useful feature. The windings for the starter-generator were usually incorporated into the engine&#x27;s flywheel, thus not requiring a separate unit at all. 

The Ford Model T relied on hand cranks until 1919; during the 1920s, electric starters became near-universal on most new cars, making it easier for women and elderly people to drive. It was still common for cars to be supplied with starter handles into the 1960s, and this continued much later for some makes (e.g. Citroën 2CV until end of production in 1990). In many cases, cranks were used for setting timing rather than starting the engine as growing displacements and compression ratios made this impractical. Communist bloc cars such as Ladas often still sported crank-starting as late as the 1980s.

For the first examples of production German turbojet engines later in World War II, Norbert Riedel designed a small two-stroke, opposed-twin gasoline engine to start both the Junkers Jumo 004 and BMW 003 aircraft gas turbines as a form of auxiliary power unit to get the central spindle of each engine design rotating — these were usually installed at the very front of the turbojet, and were themselves started by a pull-rope to get them running during the startup procedure for the jet engines they were fitted to.

Before Chrysler&#x27;s 1949 innovation of the key-operated combination ignition-starter switch, the starter was often operated by the driver pressing a button mounted on the floor or dashboard. Some vehicles had a pedal in the floor that manually engaged the starter drive pinion with the flywheel ring gear, then completed the electrical circuit to the starter motor once the pedal reached the end of its travel. Ferguson tractors from the 1940s, including the Ferguson TE20, had an extra position on the gear lever that engaged the starter switch, ensuring safety by preventing the tractors from being started in gear.

==Electric==

The electric starter motor or cranking motor is the most common type used on gasoline engines and small diesel engines. The modern starter motor is either a permanent-magnet or a series-parallel wound direct current electric motor with a starter solenoid (similar to a relay) mounted on it. When DC power from the starting battery is applied to the solenoid, usually through a key-operated switch (the &quot;ignition switch&quot;), the solenoid engages a lever that pushes out the drive pinion on the starter driveshaft and meshes the pinion with the starter ring gear on the flywheel of the engine.

The solenoid also closes high-current contacts for the starter motor, which begins to turn. Once the engine starts, the key-operated switch is opened, a spring in the solenoid assembly pulls the pinion gear away from the ring gear, and the starter motor stops. The starter&#x27;s pinion is clutched to its drive shaft through an overrunning sprag clutch which permits the pinion to transmit drive in only one direction. In this manner, drive is transmitted through the pinion to the flywheel ring gear, but if the pinion remains engaged (as for example because the operator fails to release the key as soon as the engine starts, or if there is a short and the solenoid remains engaged), the pinion will spin independently of its drive shaft. This prevents the engine driving the starter, for such backdrive would cause the starter to spin so fast as to fly apart.

The sprag clutch arrangement would preclude the use of the starter as a generator if employed in the hybrid scheme mentioned above, unless modifications were made. The standard starter motor is typically designed for intermittent use, which would preclude its use as a generator. The starter&#x27;s electrical components are designed only to operate for typically under 30 seconds before overheating (by too-slow dissipation of heat from ohmic losses), to save weight and cost. Most automobile owner manuals instruct the operator to pause for at least ten seconds after each ten or fifteen seconds of cranking the engine, when trying to start an engine that does not start immediately.

This overrunning-clutch pinion arrangement was phased into use beginning in the early 1960s; before that time, a Bendix drive was used. The Bendix system places the starter drive pinion on a helically cut drive shaft. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia of the drive pinion assembly causes it to ride forward on the helix and thus engage with the ring gear. When the engine starts, backdrive from the ring gear causes the drive pinion to exceed the rotative speed of the starter, at which point the drive pinion is forced back down the helical shaft and thus out of mesh with the ring gear. This has the disadvantage that the gears will disengage if the engine fires briefly but does not continue to run.

===Folo-Thru drive===
An intermediate development between the Bendix drive developed in the 1930s and the overrunning-clutch designs introduced in the 1960s was the Bendix Folo-Thru drive. The standard Bendix drive would disengage from the ring gear as soon as the engine fired, even if it did not continue to run. The Folo-Thru drive contains a latching mechanism and a set of flyweights in the body of the drive unit. When the starter motor begins turning and the drive unit is forced forward on the helical shaft by inertia, it is latched into the engaged position. Only once the drive unit is spun at a speed higher than that attained by the starter motor itself (i.e., it is backdriven by the running engine) will the flyweights pull radially outward, releasing the latch and permitting the overdriven drive unit to be spun out of engagement. In this manner, unwanted starter disengagement is avoided before a successful engine start.

===Gear reduction===
In 1962, Chrysler introduced a starter incorporating a geartrain between the motor and the drive shaft. The motor shaft included integrally cut gear teeth forming a pinion that meshes with a larger adjacent driven gear to provide a gear reduction ratio of 3.75:1. This permitted the use of a higher-speed, lower-current, lighter and more compact motor assembly while increasing cranking torque. Variants of this starter design were used on most rear- and four-wheel-drive vehicles produced by Chrysler Corporation from 1962 through 1987. It makes a unique, distinct sound when cranking the engine, which led to it being nicknamed the &quot;Highland Park Hummingbird&quot;—a reference to Chrysler&#x27;s headquarters in Highland Park, Michigan.

The Chrysler gear-reduction starter formed the conceptual basis for the gear-reduction starters that now predominate in vehicles on the road. Many Japanese automakers phased in gear reduction starters in the 1970s and 1980s. Light aircraft engines also made extensive use of this kind of starter, because its light weight offered an advantage.

Those starters not employing offset gear trains like the Chrysler unit generally employ planetary epicyclic gear trains instead. Direct-drive starters are almost entirely obsolete owing to their larger size, heavier weight and higher current requirements.

===Movable pole shoe===
Ford issued a nonstandard starter, a direct-drive &quot;movable pole shoe&quot; design that provided cost reduction rather than electrical or mechanical benefits. This type of starter eliminated the solenoid, replacing it with a movable pole shoe and a separate starter relay. This starter operates as follows: The driver turns the key, activating the starter switch. A small electric current flows through the solenoid actuated starter relay, closing the contacts and sending large battery current to the starter motor. One of the pole shoes, hinged at the front, linked to the starter drive, and spring-loaded away from its normal operating position, is swung into position by the magnetic field created by electricity flowing through its field coil. This moves the starter drive forward to engage the flywheel ring gear, and simultaneously closes a pair of contacts supplying current to the rest of the starter motor winding. Once the engine starts and the driver releases the starter switch, a spring retracts the pole shoe, which pulls the starter drive out of engagement with the ring gear.

This starter was used on Ford vehicles from 1973 through 1990, when a gear-reduction unit conceptually similar to the Chrysler unit replaced it.

===Inertia starter===

A variant on the electric starter motor is the inertia starter (not to be confused with the Bendix-type starter described above). Here the starter motor does not turn the engine directly. Instead, when energized, the motor turns a heavy flywheel built into its casing (not the main flywheel of the engine). Once the flywheel/motor unit has reached a constant speed the current to the motor is turned off and the drive between the motor and flywheel is disengaged by a freewheel mechanism. The spinning flywheel is then connected to the main engine and its inertia turns it over to start it. These stages are commonly automated by solenoid switches, with the machine operator using a two-position control switch, which is held in one position to spin the motor and then moved to the other to cut the current to the motor and engage the flywheel to the engine.

The advantage of the inertia starter is that, because the motor is not driving the engine directly, it can be of much lower power than the standard starter for an engine of the same size. This allows for a motor of much lower weight and smaller size, as well as lighter cables and smaller batteries to power the motor. This made the inertia starter a common choice for aircraft with large radial piston engines. The disadvantage is the increased time required to start the engine - spinning up the flywheel to the required speed can take between 10 and 20 seconds. If the engine does not start by the time the flywheel has lost its inertia then the process must be repeated for the next attempt.

==Pneumatic==
Some gas turbine engines and diesel engines, particularly on trucks, use a pneumatic self-starter. In ground vehicles the system consists of a geared turbine, an air compressor and a pressure tank. Compressed air released from the tank is used to spin the turbine, and through a set of reduction gears, engages the ring gear on the flywheel, much like an electric starter. The engine, once running, drives the compressor to recharge the tank.

Aircraft with large gas turbine engines are typically started using a large volume of low-pressure compressed air, supplied from a very small engine referred to as an auxiliary power unit, located elsewhere in the aircraft. Alternatively, aircraft gas turbine engines can be rapidly started using a mobile ground-based pneumatic starting engine, referred to as a &quot;start cart&quot; or &quot;air start cart&quot;.

On larger diesel generators found in large shore installations and especially on ships, a pneumatic starting gear is used. The air motor is normally powered by compressed air at pressures of 10–30 bar. The air motor is made up of a center drum about the size of a soup can with four or more slots cut into it to allow for the vanes to be placed radially on the drum to form chambers around the drum. The drum is offset inside a round casing so that the inlet air for starting is admitted at the area where the drum and vanes form a small chamber compared to the others. The compressed air can only expand by rotating the drum, which allows the small chamber to become larger and puts another one of the cambers in the air inlet. The air motor spins much too fast to be used directly on the flywheel of the engine; instead a large gearing reduction, such as a planetary gear, is used to lower the output speed. A Bendix gear is used to engage the flywheel.
Since large trucks typically use air brakes, the system does double duty, supplying compressed air to the brake system. Pneumatic starters have the advantages of delivering high torque, mechanical simplicity and reliability. They eliminate the need for oversized, heavy storage batteries in electrical systems.

Large Diesel generators and almost all Diesel engines used as the prime mover of ships use compressed air acting directly on the cylinder head. This is not ideal for smaller Diesels, as it provides too much cooling on starting. Also, the cylinder head needs to have enough space to support an extra valve for the air start system. The air start system is conceptually very similar to a distributor in a car. There is an air distributor that is geared to the camshaft of the Diesel engine; on the top of the air distributor is a single lobe similar to what is found on a camshaft. Arranged radially around this lobe are roller tip followers for every cylinder. When the lobe of the air distributor hits one of the followers it will send an air signal that acts upon the back of the air start valve located in the cylinder head, causing it to open. Compressed air is provided from a large reservoir that feeds into a header located along the engine. As soon as the air start valve is opened, the compressed air is admitted and the engine will begin turning. It can be used on two-cycle and four-cycle engines and on reversing engines. On large two-stroke engines less than one revolution of the crankshaft is needed for starting.

==Hydraulic==

Some diesel engines from six to 16 cylinders are started by means of a hydraulic motor. Hydraulic starters and the associated systems provide a sparkless, reliable method of engine starting over a wide temperature range. Typically hydraulic starters are found in applications such as remote generators, lifeboat propulsion engines, offshore fire pumping engines, and hydraulic fracturing rigs. The system used to support the hydraulic starter includes valves, pumps, filters, a reservoir, and piston accumulators. The operator can manually recharge the hydraulic system; this cannot readily be done with electric starting systems, so hydraulic starting systems are favored in applications wherein emergency starting is a requirement.

With various configurations, Hydraulic starters can be fitted on any engine. Hydraulic starters employ the high efficiency of the axial piston motor concept, which provides high torque at any temperature or environment, and guarantees minimal wear of the engine ring gear and the pinion.

==Non-motor==
===Spring starter===

A spring starter uses potential energy stored in a spring wound up with a crank to start an engine without a battery or alternator. Turning the crank moves the pinion into mesh with the engine&#x27;s ring gear, then winds up the spring. Pulling the release lever then applies the spring tension to the pinion, turning the ring gear to start the engine. The pinion automatically disengages from the flywheel after operation. Provision is also made to allow the engine to be slowly turned over by hand for engine maintenance. This is achieved by operating the trip lever just after the pinion has engaged with the flywheel. Subsequent turning of the winding handle during this operation will not load the starter. Spring starters can be found in engine-generators and hydraulic power packs, and on lifeboat engines, with the most common application being backup starting system on seagoing vessels. Many Briggs &amp; Stratton lawn mowers in the 1960s had hand-cranked spring starters.

===Fuel-starting===
Some modern gasoline engines with twelve or more cylinders always have at least one or more pistons at the beginning of its power stroke and are able to start by injecting fuel into that cylinder and igniting it. The same procedure can be applied to engines with fewer cylinders, if the engine happens to be stopped at the correct position. This is one way of starting an engine of a car with stop-start system.

<text>Raclette (, ) is a dish of Swiss origin, also popular in the other Alpine countries (France, Italy, Germany, Austria), based on heating cheese and scraping off the melted part, then typically served with boiled potatoes. Raclette cheese is historically a dish originating from the canton of Valais in Switzerland. This cheese from Valais benefits from an AOP. Raclette cheese is also a Swiss-type cheese marketed specifically to be used for this dish.

Raclette is also served as street food, but often with bread instead of potatoes.

==History==
Dishes of melted cheese were mentioned in medieval texts from Swiss convents as early as 1291. Melted cheese was originally consumed by peasants in the mountainous Alpine regions of the cantons of Valais and Fribourg (Switzerland), and Savoie and Haute-Savoie (France). It was then known in the German-speaking part of Switzerland as or , &quot;roasted cheese&quot;. Traditionally, cow herders carried cheese with them when they were moving cows to or from pastures up in the mountains. In the evening, the cheese would be placed next to a campfire for softening, then scraped onto bread. Melting raclette-type cheese in front of a fire is attested in Valais since 1574. Since 1875, the French term &quot;raclette&quot; is commonly used for this dish. At the 1909 Cantonal Exhibition of Sion, raclette was promoted as a national dish of Valais. Raclette eventually gained national (and international) popularity from the 1964 National Exhibition.

In Valais, raclette is typically served with potatoes, cornichons (fermented, pickled cucumbers), pickled onions, black tea, other warm beverages, or Fendant wine. A popular French option is to serve it with white wine, such as Savoy wine, but Riesling and pinot gris are also common. Traditionally, it is consumed with black tea, since a warm beverage is considered to improve digestion.

==Dish==
Raclette is a dish native to parts of Switzerland. The raclette cheese round is heated, either in front of a fire or by a special machine, then scraped onto diners&#x27; plates.

A modern way of serving raclette involves an electric table-top grill with small pans, known as &quot;coupelles&quot;, in which slices of raclette cheese are melted.

<doc id="143507" wikidata="Q55182" url="?curid=143507" title="Province of Huesca">
<text>Huesca (; ), officially Huesca/Uesca, is a province of northeastern Spain, in northern Aragon. The capital is Huesca.

Positioned just south of the central Pyrenees, Huesca borders France and the French departments of Haute-Garonne, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, and Hautes-Pyrénées. Within Spain, Huesca&#x27;s neighboring provinces are Navarre, Zaragoza, and Lleida.

==Geography==

Covering a primarily mountainous area of km², the province of Huesca has a total population of 219,345 in 2018, with almost a quarter of its people living in the capital city of Huesca. The low population density, 14.62/km², has meant that Huesca&#x27;s lush valleys, rivers, and lofty mountain ranges have remained relatively pristine and unspoiled by progress.

Home to majestic scenery, the tallest mountain in the Pyrenees, the Aneto; eternal glaciers, such as at Monte Perdido; and the National Park of Ordesa and Monte Perdido, rich in flora and protected fauna. Popular with mountaineers, spelunkers, paragliders, and white water rafters, it is also a popular snow skiing destination with notable resorts in Candanchú, Formigal, Astún, Panticosa, and Cerler.

==History==
The Romans colonised the province of Huesca, which formed the northern part of Hispania Tarraconensis, and continued to live there well into the 5th century until the arrival of the Visigoths. As a mountainous frontier region, it was difficult to dominate. The northern counties had at one time belonged to the Kingdom of Navarre but split off and managed to stem early Moorish invasions in the Middle Ages by forming alliances between themselves and with the Franks, to become Frankish feudal marches. The imperative of sovereignty, or independence, for the northern border counts, gave rise to the Kingdom of Aragon, which was the precursor to the Empire or Crown of Aragon, and ultimately the Kingdom of Spain.

==Administrative divisions==
The modern day province comprises 10 comarcas and 202 municipalities. 

The following comarcas having their capital in Huesca Province include municipal terms within Zaragoza Province:

* Bajo Cinca: Mequinenza.
* Hoya de Huesca: Murillo de Gállego and Santa Eulalia de Gállego.
* Jacetania: Artieda, Mianos, Salvatierra de Esca and Sigüés.
* Monegros: La Almolda, Bujaraloz, Farlete, Leciñena, Monegrillo and Perdiguera.

==Population==
The historical population is given in the following chart:
==Language==
Spanish is the primary language in the province. However, the local linguistic varieties in the center and north of the province (often called fabla) belong to the Aragonese language, which now survives mainly in the northernmost comarcas, such as the Aragon Valley in Jacetania, the Alto Gallego, Sobrarbe, and Ribagorza, where hitherto landlocked and isolated villages have helped the language to thrive into the 21st century.

In the easternmost areas of the province, varieties of the Catalan language are spoken, with a few transitional dialects difficult to classify as Aragonese or Catalan.

<text>Teruel (Catalan: &quot;Terol&quot; ) is a province of Aragon, in the northeast of Spain. The capital is Teruel.

It is bordered by the provinces of Tarragona, Castellón, Valencia (including its exclave Rincón de Ademuz), Cuenca, Guadalajara, and Zaragoza. The area of the province is 14,809 km². Its population is 134,572 (2018), of whom about a quarter live in the capital, and its population density is 9.36/km². It contains 236 municipalities, of which more than half are villages of under 200 people. Teruel is the second-least populated province of Spain, and also the second-lowest in population density, in both counts after the province of Soria.

The main language throughout the province is Spanish (with official status), although Catalan is spoken in a northeastern area bordering Catalonia.

==Geography==
This province is located in the mountainous Sistema Ibérico area. The main ranges in the province of Teruel are Sierra de la Virgen, Sierra de Santa Cruz, Sierra de Cucalón, Sierra de San Just, Sierra Carrascosa, Sierra Menera, Sierra Palomera, Sierra de Javalambre, Sierra de Gúdar, Sierra de Albarracín and the Montes Universales, among others.

==Depopulation and neglect==
Most of the Teruel Province has undergone massive depopulation since the middle of the 20th century. This situation is shared with other areas in Spain, particularly with those near the Iberian mountain range (much of the provinces of Soria, Guadalajara and Cuenca) and with other areas in Aragón.

The exodus from the rural mountain areas in Teruel rose after General Franco&#x27;s &quot;Plan de Estabilización&quot; in 1959. The population declined steeply as people migrated towards the industrial areas and the large cities in Spain, leaving behind their small villages where living conditions were often harsh, with cold winters and very basic facilities.

As a consequence there are many ghost towns in different parts of the province.

A great number of surviving towns in Teruel province have only a residual population, reviving somewhat during the summer when a few city-dwellers spend their holidays there. Other causes of the strong emigration have been the low productivity of traditional agricultural practices, like sheep and goat farming, the closing of mines, like the large Sierra Menera mine near Ojos Negros, as well as the lifestyle changes that swept over rural Spain during the second half of the 20th century.

The &quot;Teruel Exists&quot; () movement began at the turn of the 21st century. It is a platform of provincial authorities, institutions and sympathizers seeking to reverse the long-standing neglect of this province.

<text>Cuenca () is one of the five provinces of the autonomous community of Castilla-La Mancha. It is located in the eastern part of this autonomous community and covers 17,141 square km. It has a population of 203,841 inhabitants – the least populated of the five provinces. Its capital city is also called Cuenca.

==Geography==

The province is bordered by the provinces of Valencia (including its exclave Rincón de Ademuz), Albacete, Ciudad Real, Toledo, Madrid, Guadalajara, and Teruel. The northeastern side of the province is in the mountainous Sistema Ibérico area.

211,375 people (2007) live in the province. Its capital is Cuenca, where nearly a quarter of the population live, some 52,980 people. There are 238 municipalities in Cuenca.

Other populous towns and municipalities include Tarancón, San Clemente, Quintanar del Rey, Huete, Villanueva de la Jara, Motilla del Palancar, Mota del Cuervo, La Almarcha, and Las Pedroñeras.

==History==
In 1851, Cuenca lost Requena-Utiel to the neighbouring Valencia Province, with which it was developing commercial ties. Nevertheless, Requena-Utiel remained Spanish-speaking (rather than Catalan), while the loss of its most dynamic region left the province of Cuenca relatively underdeveloped economically.

<text>Albacete () is a province of central Spain, in the southern part of the autonomous community of Castile–La Mancha. As of 2012, Albacete had a population of 402,837 people. Its capital city, also called Albacete, is by road southeast of Madrid.

==History==
The territory occupied by the province of Albacete has been inhabited since ancient times, as evidenced by cave paintings in the Cueva del Niño and Cueva de la Vieja. In Roman times, the territory of the present province of Albacete was part of Carpetania and Celtiberia, Contestania, Bastetania and Oretania. The Romans built a significant settlement at Libisosa, and during the age of the Visigoths, Tolmo de Minateda grew in prominence.

During the Muslim era, territories of the province were under different zones of influence, and numerous farmhouses, castles and watchtowers developed to fight off invaders. A number of battles were held here in the Middle Ages, and on April 25, 1707, the Battle of Almansa was held in the vicinity of the town of Albacete, a major Spanish battle which culminated in the triumph of Philip V who ascended to the throne, establishing the monarchy for the House of Bourbon in Spain.

In 1822, the short-lived Province of Chinchilla was created, composed of municipalities in the provinces of La Mancha, Cuenca and the Kingdom of Murcia. Its capital at Chinchilla de Monte-Aragón, very close to the city of Albacete, would be the basis on which the province of Albacete was created in 1833 as dictated by Javier de Burgos. Following the adoption of the Constitution in 1978, the province of Albacete joined the Castile-La Mancha Region from the Murcia Region, and its Statute of Autonomy was approved in 1982.

==Geography==
Located in the southeast of the Central Plateau with an area of 14,926 km ², the province of Albacete is bordered by the provinces of Granada, Murcia, Alicante, Valencia, Cuenca, Ciudad Real and Jaén. The province is divided into 87 municipalities and seven judicial districts. Its seat of government is Albacete. Other important towns (with more than 10,000 inhabitants) are: Hellín, Villarrobledo, Almansa, La Roda and Caudete. The main river of the province is the Jucar river, which crosses the province in the northeast, renowned for its deep gorges and trees. The Lagunese de Ruidera flows in the west. Other rivers of note include the Cabriel on the far northeastern border, the Salobral, Navalcudi, and Tajo-Segura in the central part, the Corcoles in the northwest, and the Guadalmena, Mundo, Tus, Segura, and Taibilla rivers in the south. It is also home to seasonal rivers, including Abengibre Creek.

<text>The province of Ciudad Real () is a province in the southwestern part of the autonomous community of Castile-La Mancha, Spain. It is bordered by the provinces of Cuenca, Albacete, Jaén, Córdoba, Badajoz, and Toledo. It is partly located in the old natural region of La Mancha. Its capital is Ciudad Real. It is the third largest province by area in all of Spain, after Cáceres and Badajoz. The historic comarca Campo de Calatrava is located in the center of the province.

==History==
Ciudad Real was one of the 49 provinces in which Spain was divided in the territorial reorganization of 1833, taking its name from its largest city and capital. Its limits corresponded more or less to the historical province of La Mancha, which was part of the kingdom of Toledo.

The Spanish government created the autonomous community of Castilla-La Mancha on 15 November 1978, as one of several autonomous regions. The new, hyphenated name was chosen to join the historic Castilla region, which extended beyond the new autonomous region, and that of the smaller historic province of La Mancha. Initially a &quot;pre-autonomous&quot; region, the reorganization proposal finally took effect one week after the Statute of Autonomy of Castilla–La Mancha was approved on 10 August 1982. Under this new arrangement, Castilla-La Mancha was subdivided into five provinces, Albacete, Ciudad Real, Cuenca, Guadalajara, and Toledo, each named after its largest town and capital city.

==Geography==
The province of Ciudad Real is located in central Spain and is the third largest province in the country with an area of . To the north lies the Province of Toledo, to the northeast the Province of Cuenca, to the east the Province of Albacete, to the south lie the Provinces of Córdoba and Jaén, and to the west the Province of Badajoz. To the northwest of the province is a separate area, the exclave of Anchuras, which is sandwiched between the Province of Badajoz and the Province of Toledo. The provincial capital is Ciudad Real. Part of the province is part of the plateau of La Mancha, an elevated but fertile area averaging above sea level, the highest elevation being in the comarca of Campo de Montiel at . The main river, crossing the province from east to west, is the Guadiana, and its right bank tributary, the Cigüela.

Most of the province is an arid plain, cool in summer and very cold in winter with wide daily fluctuations. The area is agricultural, with wheat, barley, oats, sugar beet, grapes and olives being grown. Cattle are raised here and there are large flocks of sheep. In the valleys formed by the upper reaches of the Guadiana and Cigüela is a wetland area called La Mancha Húmeda. The lagoons and marshes have a resident population of wetland birds and are visited by migrating wildfowl in autumn and spring.

The largest towns in the province are Ciudad Real, with a population of 74,960 at the 2014 census, Puertollano with 50,608, Tomelloso with 38,080, Alcázar de San Juan with 31,650, and Valdepeñas with 30,705. Other larger municipalities with over ten thousand inhabitants are Manzanares, Daimiel, La Solana, Miguelturra, Campo de Criptana, Socuéllamos, Bolaños de Calatrava and Villarrubia de los Ojos.

The Tablas de Daimiel National Park is located in the province of Ciudad Real. It is a wetland area on the La Mancha plain, an otherwise mainly arid region. It has an area of about 2,000 hectares and is the smallest of Spain&#x27;s fifteen national parks. It is being expanded to include some of the neighbouring dryland farming areas. The Cabañeros National Park is shared with the neighbouring Province of Toledo. It has an area of and lies between the Estena and Bullaque rivers, extending into the Chorito and Miraflores mountain ranges. It contains remnants of the Iberian Mediterranean forest which used to clothe this part of Spain.

In the centre of the province is the Campo de Calatrava, the geology of which is volcanic. The Campo de Calatrava Volcanic Field covers an area of and has more than three hundred individual structures. It is composed of pyroclastic cones, lava domes and maars, and rises to . The last known eruption was around 3,600 BC.

==Population development==
The historical population is given in the following chart:
== Government and administration ==
==Communications==
The province has good communications with other parts of Spain and is on the main route between Toledo and Andalusia. The A-4 route passes from north to south between Puerto Lápice and Almuradiel on the way from Madrid to Andalusia. The capital, Puertollano, and other locations are linked to this road by the A-43 and A-41, and the Autovía de los Viñedos motorway passes through the northeastern part of the province. Railway communications are via the Madrid–Seville high-speed rail line which has stations in the towns of Ciudad Real and Puertollano. Air travel was enabled by the opening in 2008 of the Ciudad Real Central Airport, which started to have international flights in June 2010. However, the link to the high-speed railway line was never built and the airport had financial difficulties and went into administration in October of the same year. In September 2015, it was reported that a new owner had purchased the airport.

<text>East Dunbartonshire (; , ) is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland. It borders Glasgow City Council Area to the south, North Lanarkshire to the east, Stirling to the north, and West Dunbartonshire to the west. East Dunbartonshire contains many of the suburbs in the north of Greater Glasgow, including Bearsden, Milngavie, Bishopbriggs, Kirkintilloch, Lenzie, Twechar, Milton of Campsie, Balmore, and Torrance, as well as some other of Glasgow&#x27;s commuter towns and villages. The council area covers parts of the historic counties of Dunbartonshire, Lanarkshire, and Stirlingshire.

The council area was formed in 1996, as a result of the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, from the former Bearsden and Milngavie districts and most of the former Strathkelvin district, which had been part of the Strathclyde region.

==History==
East Dunbartonshire was created in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, which abolished the regions and districts which had been created in 1975, replacing them with unitary council areas. East Dunbartonshire covered the area of the abolished Bearsden and Milngavie and Strathkelvin districts (except the Chryston and Auchinloch area from the latter, which went to North Lanarkshire). Both former districts had been in the Strathclyde region.

Both of East Dunbartonshire&#x27;s predecessor districts had been created in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. The Bearsden and Milngavie district had been created covering Milngavie, Bearsden and adjoining areas from Dunbartonshire. The Strathkelvin district had been created covering Kirkintilloch and adjoining areas from Dunbartonshire, Bishopbriggs and adjoining areas from Lanarkshire, and the parishes of Baldernock and Campsie from Stirlingshire.

==Demographics==
East Dunbartonshire council area has low levels of deprivation, with relatively low unemployment and low levels of crime. The population is both declining and ageing.

In a 2007 Reader&#x27;s Digest poll, East Dunbartonshire was voted the best place in Britain to raise a family. The area has generally performed well in the Halifax Quality of Life survey; in 2010 it was ranked third in Scotland, and it was the only Scottish area in the British Top 20 in 2008. A Legatum Prosperity Index published by the Legatum Institute in October 2016 showed East Dunbartonshire as the most prosperous council area in Scotland and the ninth most prosperous in the United Kingdom.

==Communities==
The area is divided into thirteen community council areas, twelve of which have community councils as at 2023 (being those with asterisks in the list below):

*Baldernock*
*Bearsden East*
*Bearsden North*
*Bearsden West*
*Bishopbriggs*
*Campsie*
*Kirkintilloch*
*Lenzie*
*Milngavie*
*Milton of Campsie*
*Torrance*
*Twechar
*Waterside*
==Governance==
===Political control===
The first election to East Dunbartonshire Council was held in 1995, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new system came into force on 1 April 1996. Political control of the council since 1996 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The first leader of the council, Charles Kennedy, had been the last leader of the old Strathkelvin District Council. The leaders of East Dunbartonshire Council since 1996 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2022 election and subsequent changes of allegiance up to July 2024, the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in 2027.

===Premises===
Since 2012 the council has been based at 12 Strathkelvin Place in Kirkintilloch, which forms part of the Southbank Marina development adjoining the Forth and Clyde Canal. Prior to 2012 the council was based at Tom Johnston House at the junction of Lenzie Road and Civic Way in Kirkintilloch. Tom Johnston House had been built in 1985 as the headquarters for the old Strathkelvin District Council and was named after Tom Johnston (1881–1965), who was born in Kirkintilloch and had served as Secretary of State for Scotland during the Second World War. Tom Johnston House was demolished in 2015. The new council chamber at Strathkelvin Place is called Tom Johnston Chamber.

==Elections==

Since 2007 elections have been held every five years under the single transferable vote system, introduced by the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004. Election results since 1995 have been as follows:


===Wards===

Since 2007, the council (as with all others in Scotland) has been elected using multi-member wards, each returning three councillors using a single transferable vote system of proportional representation. Initially this retained the number of councillors at 24 following on from the same number of single-member wards in previous elections, divided equally across eight wards. However, a national boundary and population review prior to the 2017 Scottish local elections led to the number of East Dunbartonshire wards being reduced to seven and the number of councillors being reduced to 22. These current wards are:

<doc id="143516" wikidata="Q54925" url="?curid=143516" title="Province of Guadalajara">
<text>Guadalajara () is a province of Spain, belonging to the autonomous community of Castilla–La Mancha. As of 2019 it had a population of 258,890 people. The population of the province has grown in the last 10 years. It is located in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula.

==History==
===Prehistory===

The province has been inhabited since the Paleolithic as evidenced by stone tools found on the banks of the Henares and Linares rivers. There are also numerous prehistoric cave paintings in the Cueva de los Casares in Riba de Saelices while Megalithic tombs from the 4th millennium B.C. have been found at various sites in the province including Alcolea del Pinar. There are remains of several Bronze Age settlements along the river banks in the area, notably that in Loma del Lomo in Cogolludo as well as a late Bronze Age settlement in Mojares.

===Celtiberians and Romans===
The Celtiberians occupied the territory during the late Iron Age between the 6th and 3rd centuries B.C. in Sigüenza, Atienza, and Termancia in the north and further south around Molina. In addition to raising livestock and breeding horses, they created many fortified towns and villages as well as castles. Between 143 and 133 B.C., the Romans initiated their battles to conquer Spain which continued until 94 B.C. They brought agriculture, mining, and commerce to the region, facilitating communications with roads and bridges. The important Roman city was Segontia (Sigüenza), although they built a town wall around Luzaga and public buildings.

===Middle Ages===

The Visigoths, with their capital at Toledo, were dominant in the area around the 6th and 7th centuries A.D., bringing Christianity and Germanic law into the region. In 578, King Leovigild founded Recópolis on the River Tagus with a basilica and a palace. The Moors arrived in the area in c. 711, establishing Islamic rule for some four centuries until the early 13th century. Their most important contribution was founding of the current-day provincial capital, Madinat-al-Faray (Guadalajara, from Arabic &quot;wādi al-ħajāra&quot;, &quot;streambed/valley of stones&quot;), which was established by the Berber captain al-Faray, remembered for overcoming the Christians in the 9th century.

The territory now covered by the Province of Guadalajara was part of the Middle March of Al-Andalus. Generally sparsely populated, the most important towns were Atienza, Guadalajara, Jadraque, Hita and Sigüenza. Following the dismemberment of the Caliphate of Córdoba, Toledo gained independence in 1018, reaching its zenith under Yahya-al-Mamun who reigned from 1043 to 1075. Following his death, pressure from King Alfonso VI of León and Castile led to the beginning of Christian conquest of the region in 1085. By the early 12th century, Molina, La Serrania, Sigüenza and the Tagus Valley were retrieved leading to the establishment of the Bishopric of Sigüenza. Under Alfonso VII and Alfonso VIII, the region was repopulated with people from other parts of Castile. With the conquest of Cuenca and Alarcón at the end of the 12th century and the victory at Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, the entire territory of Guadalajara was again in the hands of the Castilian Christians.

===Modern age and Renaissance===

The modern age began with the Catholic Monarchs, Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon whose marriage in Valladolid in 1469 united the crowns of Castile and Aragón. They centralized the authority which had developed in the church, the military and the nobility ostensibly to earn income for fighting the infidels by reselling the territories they had gained. In the 16th century, this practice was reinforced by Charles I and Philip II. In Guadalajara, this was particularly the case with areas that had belonged to the military orders of Calatrava and Pastrana. The Mendozas who succeeded in acquiring substantial territories built a fortified palace in Pastrana and extended their influence over Sayatón, Escopete and Albalate.

Under the Mendozas, the city of Guadalajara prospered in the 15th and 16th centuries, attracting writers, historians and philosophers, bringing it the name &quot;la Atenas alcarreña&quot; (the Alcarrian Athens). Encouraged by the Renaissance, Íñigo López de Mendoza, 1st Marquis of Santillana, (1398–1458) not only built palaces, churches and monasteries but developed a large library of Greek and Latin volumes. In the 16th century, his namesake Íñigo López de Mendoza, 4th Duke of the Infantado, (1493–1566) went on to found an academy in the city, attracting additional writers. Pastrana also prospered during the Renaissance under the leadership of Ruy Gómez de Silva (1516–1573) with the establishment of Latin and choir schools. By the end of the 16th century, the town was famous for its tapestries and its Carmelite convents. With the death of Ruy&#x27;s widow, Ana de Mendoza in 1592, the nobility moved to Madrid, causing the province to lose the high status it had achieved. While the Spanish Golden Age developed in central Spain during the 17th century, Guadalajara experienced an extended period of decline as the Habsburgs brought about increased centralization.

===18th and 19th centuries===
In the early 18th century, under the War of the Spanish Succession, the city of Guadalajara and the province&#x27;s main towns all suffered considerable damage. In 1719, a royal textile factory was established in Guadalajara, bringing workers not only from across Spain but from the rest of Europe, especially the Netherlands. The factory prospered throughout the 18th century but was closed in the early 19th century as a result of the War of Spanish Independence. During the War of Independence, French troops caused extensive damage to towns in the province, especially Molina where over 600 buildings were destroyed by fire. When the city of Guadalajara was liberated in 1813, it was left in a devastated and poverty-stricken state. Conditions improved in 1840 with the establishment of the Academy of Military Engineering in the former textile factory. Further military installations followed, culminating at the end of the century in the establishment of the Airship Regiment which led to a range of early exploits and experiments.
The finding of silver in the mining district of Hiendelaencina in 1844 lead to a silver rush in the area.

===Recent history===

The military facilities continued to provide Guadalajara with financial relief during the first 30 years of the 20th century. The population increased slightly, while further improvements resulted from the influence of the wealthy landowner and politician Count of Romanones who was the representative for Guadalajara from 1886 to 1936. After fighting on the Republican side during the Spanish Civil War, the province was given little attention by the successive governments of Francisco Franco until the late 1950s when plans for moving industrial development out of Madrid began to favour Guadalajara and the Henares corridor. While new industries and improved communications brought prosperity to Guadalajara, Torrejón, Alcalá, Azuqueca and Yunquera de Henares, it also caused drastic decreases in population in rural areas.

From 16 to 20 July 2005 the province was devastated by a forest fire, known as the &quot;incendio de Guadalajara&quot;. Eleven firefighters died after a blowup. The fire was caused by hikers barbecuing.

==Geography and climate==


The Province of Guadalajara is located in eastern-central Spain, the northeast of the autonomous community of Castile-La Mancha, covering an area of , 3.42% of the area of Spain. It is bordered by the provinces of Cuenca, Madrid, Segovia, Soria, Zaragoza, and Teruel. Its capital is Guadalajara, where nearly 35% of the province&#x27;s population lives. There are 288 municipalities in Guadalajara, of which more than three-quarters are villages with populations less than 200.

Guadalajara is a mountainous region, the eastern side of the province is in the Sistema Ibérico area, while the Sistema Central rises in the western part. The Sistema Ibérico occupies the northeastern part, with the Sierras de Somosierra, Ayllón, Sierra del Ocejón, Alto Rey, Bodera Barahona, and Radona mountains in the vicinity. The mountains are mainly limestone, eroded by the gorges of the rivers, such as the Henares (with a basin area of 3,735 square kilometres), and Jarama (with a basin area of 782 square kilometres) rivers.

The Tagus (Tajo), one of Spain&#x27;s main rivers, is a major river of the eastern part of the province, forming a basin with an area of 4,686 square kilometres, part of the wider Madrid basin. Also of note is the Tajuña River with an area of 2,015 square kilometres, and the Ebro River, forming a basin area of 996 square kilometres. Other features of note are the Parque Natural del Alto Tajo, Hayedo de Tejera Negra, Lagunas de Puebla de Beleña, Cerros Margosos de Pastrana y Yebra, Cerros Volcánicos de La Miñosa and Prados Húmedos de Torremocha del Pinar.

===Climate===

The province, given its wide and varied geographical features, has a range of different weather conditions, although generally it may be classified as a typical Mediterranean Continental climate of the Central Plateau. Long, dry and hot summers, with equally long and harsh winters give way to milder weather conditions in spring and later in autumn. The climatic diversity produces a range of vegetation and ecosystems, and trees such as oaks, juniper, pine, beech, etc. can all be found in the province. The seasonal distribution of rainfall is influenced by the relief, the most rainfall occurring in the mountainous areas of the Sistema Ibérico with between 700 and 900 mm per year, and in the headwaters of the Jarama and Sorbe rivers in the Sierra de Ayllon, with more than 800 mm. The Henares and Tajuña valleys, and the northern area of moorland in Sigüenza have less than 600 mm annually on average, and in some areas such as the Molina moorlands, bordering the provinces of Zaragoza and Teruel, rainfall may be below 400 mm.

===Subdivisions===

The province contains the comarcas of La Alcarria, La Campiña, La Serranía and Señorío de Molina-Alto Tajo.

Landmarks of note include the castle and walls of Palazuelos, Palace of El Infantado, Ducal Palace of Pastrana, Palace of the Dukes of Medinaceli (Cogolludo), Sigüenza Cathedral, Cueva de los Casares in La Riba de Saelices and Castillo de Pioz. The Co-cathedral of Santa María de la Fuente la Mayor in the city of Guadalajara was declared a &quot;Bien de Interés Cultural&quot; site in 1941.

===Castles===
Standing high on a rock, Atienza Castle can be seen from miles around. It frequently changed hands between the Moors and the Christians until it was finally retaken by Alfonso VI in 1085. With foundations dating back to the 5th century, Sigüenza Castle was extended by the Moors and retaken for the Christians by Bernard of Agen in 1123. In the late 18th century, Bishop Juan Díaz de la Guerra changed the appearance of the fortress into that of an episcopal palace but during the War of Spanish Independence it was taken by the French who seriously damaged it. In the 1830s, it was devastated by fire and had to be abandoned. After being fully restored, the castle was opened as a Parador luxury hotel in 1976. Decorated with banners and suits of armour, the huge lounge is the castle&#x27;s original dining room.

The Castle of Molina de Aragón is located on a hill commanding the surrounding valley, and is formed by an external line of walls with four gates and six towers of which four are currently in good condition. Originally, the line of towers included a village. The castle originated as a Moorish fortress (10th-11th century), built over a pre-existing Celtiberian castle. The fortress was used as residence of the lords of the taifa of Molina. El Cid resided here when he was exiled from Castile. In 1129 it was conquered from the Moors by Alfonso I of Aragon.

The impressive Torija Castle was built in the 11th century by the Knights Templar. Constructed of Alcarria limestone, the rectangular structure has three round towers and a cylindrical keep. In 1445, it was taken by the Navarran captain Juan de Puelles and was subsequently owned by Cardinal Pedro González de Mendoza (1428–1495). In the 19th century, it was occupied by the French under General Hugo, the father of Victor Hugo, until it was taken and destroyed by El Empecinado. Its restoration was completed in 1962.

Jadraque Castle overlooking the River Henares, sometimes known as the Castle of El Cid, has four round towers and one rectangular tower. Today&#x27;s perfectly proportioned palatial structure was built by Juan Guas in the 15th century but it stands on the site of a fortress used for centuries by the Moors. The outer fabric has been substantially restored but the interior is still in a state of ruin.

<doc id="143517" wikidata="Q55288" url="?curid=143517" title="Province of Ávila">
<text>Ávila () is a province of central-western Spain, in the southern part of the autonomous community of Castile and León. It is bordered on the south by the provinces of Toledo and Cáceres, on the west by Salamanca, on the north by Valladolid, and on the east by Segovia and Madrid. Ávila has a population of 158,265 (2018) and is ranked 47th out of 50 of Spanish provinces in population. Its capital is Ávila.

==Geography==

Ávila is naturally divided into two sections, differing completely in soil and climate. The northern portion is generally level; the soil is of indifferent quality, strong and in a few places, but rocky in all the valleys of the Sierra de Ávila; and the climate alternates from severe cold in winter to extreme heat in summer. The population of this part is mainly agricultural. The southern division, however, is one mass of rugged granitic sierras, interspersed with sheltered and well-watered valleys, abounding with rich vegetation.

The winter, especially in the elevated region of the Paramera and the wastelands of Ávila, is long and severe, but the climate is not unhealthy.

The principal mountain chains are the Guadarrama, separating this province from Madrid; the Paramera and Sierra de Ávila, west of the Guadarrama; and the vast wall of the Sierra de Gredos along the southern frontier, where its outstanding peaks rise from around . Pico Almanzor is the highest point. The ridges which from the Paramera are covered with valuable forests of beeches, oaks and firs, presenting a striking contrast to the bare peaks of the Sierra de Gredos.

The main rivers stemming from the Sierra de Gredos are the Alberche, the Tiétar, and the Tormes. The first two belong to the Tagus basin, while the latter belongs to the Douro catchment area. Meanwhile, the Adaja, another Douro tributary whose source lies at the cut-off point of the Sierra de Ávila and La Serrota, carries little water in the Summer.

==History==

The first recorded inhabitants of Ávila were the Celts, who left behind a number of large stone statues of bulls called Verracos, with the largest number of surviving examples in Ávila. The area of the province was conquered by the Romans around 192 B.C. After the Roman Empire fell, the area became part of the Visigothic Kingdom, and it is from this period we have many of the earliest records of the towns of Ávila.

The population of the territory comprising the current-day province of Ávila greatly decreased since the late 16th century and the first half of the 17th century, taking over nearly two centuries to recover the late 16th century population.

<text>The West Highland Way () is a linear long-distance route in Scotland. It is long, running from Milngavie north of Glasgow to Fort William in the Scottish Highlands, with an element of hill walking in the route. The trail, which opened in 1980, was Scotland&#x27;s first officially designated Long Distance Route, and is now designated by NatureScot as one of Scotland&#x27;s Great Trails. It is primarily intended as a long distance walking route, and whilst many sections are suitable for mountain biking and horseriding there are obstacles and surfaces that will require these users to dismount in places.

It is managed by the West Highland Way Management Group (WHWMG) consisting of the local authorities for East Dunbartonshire, Stirling, Argyll and Bute and Highland, alongside the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park Authority and NatureScot. About 120,000 people use the path every year, of whom about 36,000 walk the entire route. The path is estimated to generate £5.5 million each year for the local economy. about 100,000 people walked part of the Way each year, with 36,000 completing the route.

Notable wildlife that may be seen includes feral goats (descendants of those left from the Highland Clearances), red deer, and around the peaks sometimes golden eagles.

== History ==
There were no trails of this kind in Scotland until the Way was opened. After the Second World War ex-RAF man Tom Hunter from Glasgow conceived of the idea of an official footpath, partly to protect the eastern shore of Loch Lomond from development. The route, with some challenging terrain, had to be worked out, and landowners negotiated with. Significant in the development of the Way was geographer Fiona Rose who surveyed the route over a year in the early 1970s, covering some 1,000 miles on foot.

The trail was approved for development in 1974, and after completion was opened on 6 October 1980 by Lord Mansfield so becoming the first officially designated long-distance footpath in Scotland.

In June 2010, the West Highland Way was co-designated as part of the International Appalachian Trail.

In 2020 plans to celebrate the Way&#x27;s 40th birthday were interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. A virtual exhibition was set up to showcase the history, memories and highlights of the first 40 years. A special video welcome was recorded by Jimmie Macgregor, whose radio and TV programmes helped popularise the Way in the 1980s.

== The route ==

The path uses many ancient roads, including ancient drovers&#x27; roads, military roads dating to the Jacobite uprisings and old coaching routes. It is usually walked from south to north, making it a journey from the Lowlands to the Highlands. The route is commonly walked in seven to eight days, although many fitter and more experienced walkers do it in five or six, staying overnight in villages along the Way. The route can be covered in considerably less time than this ( the record was ), but a less hurried progress is the choice of the majority of walkers, allowing for appreciation of the countryside along the Way. Due to the large number of walkers being constrained to a single track, some parts of the Way have become badly eroded. However, a considerable amount of work is undertaken to maintain the route.

A walk along the Way is often broken up into sections or stages, each of which will typically be walked in a day. One pattern of sections, travelling from south to north, is as follows:

===Milngavie to Drymen===
The path officially starts in the centre of Milngavie, a town on the northern fringe of the conurbation of Glasgow. A granite obelisk is located a short distance from Milngavie railway station. Heading north, the path passes Mugdock Castle and Mugdock Country Park before emerging into open countryside, and the Campsie Fells can be seen. By the west side of Craigallian loch the path passes a small monument to commemorate The Craigallian Fire, an important historical symbol for outdoor activities in Scotland. As the Way approaches the Campsies by the piece of ground known as Tinkers Loan, there is an opportunity to explore adjacent hills such as Dumgoyne (grid reference ; ) or the small but heavily wooded Dumgoyach (; ). Finally the Way reaches the village of Drymen.

This section is about long:

* Milngavie to Carbeth – 
* Carbeth to Drymen – 

===Drymen to Balmaha===
After leaving Drymen the path enters Garadhban Forest before reaching the first major summit of the route, the Conic Hill , a site of special scientific interest lying on the Highland Boundary Fault. The main route goes over the summit, but an alternative &quot;bad weather&quot; route via Milton of Buchanan allows walkers to avoid the ascent to the summit. The village of Balmaha on the eastern shore of Loch Lomond is the next settlement reached.

* Drymen to Balmaha – 

===Balmaha to Rowardennan===
The path heads north along the wooded eastern shore of Loch Lomond, to reach the village of Rowardennan, the furthest point north to which there is road access available from the south on the east shore of the loch. Camping along the shore of Loch Lomond is by permit only from 1 March to 30 September.

* Balmaha to Rowardennan – 

=== Rowardennan to Inverarnan ===
The path leaves Rowardennan and continues north, along the wooded eastern shore of Loch Lomond to Inverarnan. The route follows the lower slopes of Ben Lomond before returning to the waterside at Inversnaid, where there is road access from the east, via Aberfoyle. North of Inversnaid the route passes a cavern known as Rob Roy&#x27;s cave, before reaching Inverarnan. This section is regarded as the most difficult of the entire Way. Just north of Inversnaid the eastern shore is very steep, dominated by boulders which requires some scrambling over obstacles.

* Rowardennan to Inverarnan – 

===Inverarnan to Tyndrum===
The way skirts the hills just west of Crianlarich alongside Bogle Glen. At the deer gate an additional path leads to Crianlarich. Meanwhile, the route continues up through the dense woodland to one of the high points of the Way before descending to cross the A82 and pass through Auchtertyre Farm and gently up to Tyndrum.

* Inverarnan to Tyndrum – 

===Tyndrum to Glen Coe===
This is one of the more remote sections of the route, with little in the way of settlements. The route passes over the drovers&#x27; road between Bridge of Orchy and Inveroran with large panoramic views, and not much sign of civilisation. This section is about long:

* Tyndrum to Bridge of Orchy – 
* Bridge of Orchy to Inveroran Hotel – 
* Inveroran Hotel to Kingshouse – 

===Glen Coe to Kinlochleven===

Glen Coe () is often considered one of the most spectacular and beautiful places in Scotland, and is a part of the designated National Scenic Area of Ben Nevis and Glen Coe. The route climbs the Devil&#x27;s Staircase before a great descent to sea level at Kinlochleven.

* Kingshouse to Kinlochleven – 

===Kinlochleven to Fort William===

The final stage skirts the Mamore Mountains on an old military road and descends into Glen Nevis before finishing in Fort William. Starting with a steep climb out of Kinlochleven, the route follows the contour of the valley, until the forest is reached outside Fort William. The last stage passes the foot of Ben Nevis, before finally reaching the pavements leading into the traditional finish line in Fort William, where a statue depicting a man with sore feet marks the end of the path. Many walkers crown their achievement of walking the Way by climbing Ben Nevis, the highest mountain in the United Kingdom.

* Kinlochleven to Fort William – 

== Ultramarathons on the West Highland Way ==

There are several ultramarathons held on the West Highland Way. The Highland Fling Race is an annual race from Milngavie to Tyndrum. The Devil o&#x27; the Highlands Footrace is from Tyndrum to Fort William, along the northern section of the way. The West Highland Way Race is an annual race along the full south–north distance of the West Highland Way. The West Highland Way Challenge Race is a younger, alternative race which also covers the full route.

===West Highland Way Race===

The race has been run in its current form since 1991. The race starts at 1 am on the Saturday nearest to the summer solstice.

Bobby Shields (Clydesdale Harriers) and Duncan Watson (Lochaber) initiated the idea of racing over Scotland&#x27;s most popular long-distance footpath.

On 22 June 1985 the two set out from Milngavie. Their route differed in many ways from the route of today: it was shorter, at , and had more on tarmac, with around less of climbing. After around , as they started over Rannoch Moor, they decided to cease competing against each other and ran together. They set a time of 17 hours 48 minutes 30 seconds.

In 1986 Shields and Watson opened up an invitation to some fellow runners to race in the opposite direction, Fort William – Milngavie. 1987 saw a return to the established direction of running, South – North. Of eleven starters seven arrived in Fort William. Jim Stewart took over the organisation of the event in 1991, as the footpath was now complete, the course was changed, increasing the distance to with only on road and more climbing was introduced. With this increased difficulty runners were likely to be out longer and now a bigger percentage are out for a second night.

Dario Melaragni, who had completed the race himself three times, took over as race director in 1999. He developed the format of the race by involving local mountain rescue teams who provided emergency response during the event. He also inaugurated and developed the race website, which has become a prime source of information for runners wishing to attempt the race. The race has gained status in recent years and entries open in the November preceding each race – for the 2013 a ballot process was used for the first time to allow 250 entries.

In July 2009, whilst out running with friends, Melaragni suffered a suspected heart attack and died near the summit of Lochnagar in the Cairngorms. His funeral was attended by many people wearing West Highland Way Race clothing.

The race record holder is Rob Sinclair with a time of 13 h 41 m 8 s, set in June 2017. The female record holder is Lucy Colquhoun of Aviemore with a time of 17 h 16 m 20 s, set in 2007.

<doc id="143521" wikidata="Q207111" url="?curid=143521" title="North Lanarkshire">
<text>North Lanarkshire (; ) is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland. It borders the north-east of the Glasgow City council area and contains many of Glasgow&#x27;s suburbs, commuter towns, and villages. It also borders East Dunbartonshire, Falkirk, Stirling, South Lanarkshire, and West Lothian. The council area covers parts of the historic counties of Dunbartonshire, Lanarkshire, and Stirlingshire. The council is based in Motherwell.

The area was formed in 1996, covering the districts of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, Motherwell, and Monklands, plus the Chryston and Auchinloch areas from Strathkelvin district, all of which had been in the Strathclyde region between 1975 and 1996. As a new single-tier authority, North Lanarkshire became responsible for all functions previously performed by both the regional council and the district councils, which were abolished.

==History==
The largest part of North Lanarkshire, being the approximately two-thirds of the council area lying generally south of the Luggie Water, was in the historic county of Lanarkshire. Lanarkshire had existed as a shire from around the time of King David I, who ruled Scotland from 1124 to 1153. The county took its name from the original county town at Lanark, now in South Lanarkshire, which had been the site of the first Parliament of Scotland under Kenneth II in 978. The northern parts of what is now North Lanarkshire were in the counties of Dunbartonshire and Stirlingshire prior to 1975, with Cumbernauld and the area generally north of Luggie Water and south of the River Kelvin being in Dunbartonshire, and Kilsyth and the area north of the Kelvin being in Stirlingshire. Prior to the 1975 reforms there were five burghs in the area now covered by North Lanarkshire:
*Airdrie
*Coatbridge
*Cumbernauld (burgh status given in 1968 following growth of the new town)
*Kilsyth
*Motherwell and Wishaw (formerly two separate burghs prior to merging in 1920)

The population of the area which would become North Lanarkshire grew quickly during the Industrial Revolution. In the 18th century the area&#x27;s towns, including Motherwell, were active in textile production. The discovery of coal and iron ore deposits in the 19th century, as well as the building of the Glasgow to Edinburgh railway, transformed the region. The towns of Motherwell, Coatbridge and Wishaw became centres of the iron and steel industry.

These industries began to decline in the second half of the 20th century, while a growth occurred in the financial and technology sectors, as well as a growth in logistics services related to the heavy goods traffic in the area. The new town of Cumbernauld expanded rapidly after World War II, and is now the largest town in North Lanarkshire. The growth of the Greater Glasgow metropolitan area into the south-western part of North Lanarkshire has also led to a large number of residential areas for commuters.

The North Lanarkshire council area was established in 1996 as part of a reorganisation of local government in the United Kingdom. This was the latest in a series of reforms, notably including the creation of Lanarkshire County Council in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, and the abolition of the county councils and creation of Strathclyde Regional Council and lower-tier district councils in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. The 1996 reform abolished Strathclyde, and established North Lanarkshire as a merger of the districts of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, Monklands, Motherwell and the Chryston area from Strathkelvin district (the rest of which went to East Dunbartonshire).

For lieutenancy purposes, North Lanarkshire straddles the Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire lieutenancies, with the area generally north of Luggie Water (including Cumbernauld and Kilsyth) coming under the Dunbartonshire lieutenancy and the remainder coming under the Lanarkshire lieutenancy.

==Geography==
North Lanarkshire lies in the Central Valley of Scotland, to the east of Glasgow. It lies on the Scotland&#x27;s north–south watershed with the River Clyde flowing through the west of the county on its way to the Irish Sea, and the River Almond in the east emptying into the Firth of Forth near Edinburgh. The northern areas consist of forests as well as higher areas such as the Kilsyth Hills.

==Demographics==

The highest population density of North Lanarkshire is in the urbanised south-west, which is part of the Greater Glasgow metropolitan area. Northern and eastern areas are more rural in character, with agricultural activity such as dairy and meat farming.

<text>Renfrewshire () (; ) is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland. Renfrewshire is located in the west central Lowlands. It borders East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, Inverclyde, North Ayrshire and West Dunbartonshire, and lies on the southern bank of the River Clyde. The current council area of Renfrewshire was established in 1996. The town of Paisley is the area&#x27;s main settlement and centre of local government. The area also contains the historic county town of Renfrew.

The council area has the same name as the historic county of Renfrewshire, which had been abolished for local government purposes in 1975, but the modern council area only covers the central part of the historic county. The eastern part of the pre-1975 county is covered by the East Renfrewshire council area, and the western part by the Inverclyde council area.

The term Renfrewshire may also be used to refer to the larger historic county, which was established in the fifteenth century. The three council areas of Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, and East Renfrewshire together form the Renfrewshire lieutenancy area. The same area also has a joint valuation board area for electoral registration and local tax valuation purposes. The three council areas together are sometimes referred to as Greater Renfrewshire to distinguish them from the council area called Renfrewshire.

==Toponymy==
The name Renfrewshire derives from being the shire (the area controlled by a sheriff) administered from the royal burgh of Renfrew. The name Renfrew has been attested since the Roman occupation of Britain. The name is believed to originate from Common Brittonic/Cumbric, from ren, as in Scottish Gaelic: &quot;rinn&quot;, or as in Welsh: &quot;rhyn&quot; (a point or cape of land) and from frew, as in Welsh: &quot;fraw&quot;, or &quot;ffrau&quot; (flow of water). This suggests a point of land near the flow of water, such as at the confluence of the Cart and Clyde rivers.

==History==

The historic county of Renfrewshire was abolished for local government purposes in 1975. The county was divided to become three of the nineteen districts in the Strathclyde region, being Eastwood, Inverclyde, and Renfrew.

In the debates leading to the local government reforms of the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, the government initially proposed replacing these three districts with two council areas: &quot;West Renfrewshire&quot;, covering Inverclyde district and the western parts of Renfrew district (including Paisley, Johnstone, and Renfrew), and &quot;East Renfrewshire&quot;, covering Eastwood district and the eastern parts of Renfrew district (including Barrhead, Neilston and Ralston). The proposals were criticised, with West Renfrewshire having three times the population of East Renfrewshire; the accusation was made in parliament that the proposed changes constituted gerrymandering, with East Renfrewshire only being kept separate because it had more Conservative voters.

The proposals were not supported locally, with Inverclyde successfully campaigning to be allowed to form its own council area, and the Ralston area voting in a referendum not to be transferred to East Renfrewshire. When the government conceded to allow Inverclyde to continue as a separate authority, the name West Renfrewshire was dropped. The central district was instead named Renfrewshire, despite only covering the central part of the historic county of that name. The new Renfrewshire covered the former Renfrew district except for the Barrhead electoral division (which also included Neilston) which went instead to East Renfrewshire. The new council areas came into effect on 1 April 1996.

The Braehead shopping centre was built in 1999 straddling the boundary between Renfrewshire and Glasgow, leading to a dispute between the two councils. It was agreed that the boundary should be changed to place the whole centre in one council area, but both authorities wanted it. In 2002, the Local Government Boundary Commission eventually redrew the boundary to include all of the centre in Renfrewshire.

==Demographics==
==Culture==

Renfrewshire contains several places of interest. In the west of Renfrewshire, Castle Semple Loch at Lochwinnoch and the wider Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park are natural areas of interest, as is the Gleniffer Braes country park in the south.

Paisley contains several historic buildings and notable sites, including Paisley Abbey, Paisley Museum and Coats Observatory, Paisley Town Hall, Coats Memorial Church, Sma&#x27; Shot Cottages and St Mirren Park (home of St Mirren F.C.). Outside of Paisley, Elderslie, the claimed birthplace of Scottish knight William Wallace, contains a monument in his honour, while the Weaver&#x27;s Cottage at Kilbarchan is in the care of the National Trust for Scotland. The town of Johnstone is notable for Johnstone Castle, Johnstone High Parish Church and for containing a museum within a supermarket.

The Braehead Arena in Renfrewshire close to the boundary with Glasgow is home to leading professional basketball team, the Scottish Rocks, who compete in the British Basketball League. The arena was also host to the 2000 Ford World Curling Championships.

===UK Parliament===
The two parliamentary constituencies covering Renfrewshire are Paisley and Renfrewshire North and Paisley and Renfrewshire South, being represented by Labour Party politicians Alison Taylor and Johanna Baxter of the respectively. Created in 2005, both seats had held by the Labour Party, until they were won by Gavin Newlands and Mhairi Black with swings of over 26% in the SNP landslide at the 2015 general election. Both seats returned to Labour following the 2024 general election.

===Scottish Parliament===
Following the establishment of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, the Labour Party held the three seats covering Renfrewshire, although with lower majorities than their House of Commons equivalents.

Constituency boundaries were redrawn for the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, with the new constituencies of Renfrewshire North and West and Paisley being gained by Derek Mackay and George Adam, who became the first SNP parliamentarians in Renfrewshire. The remaining Labour seat, Renfrewshire South, was gained by the SNP&#x27;s Tom Arthur at the 2016 Scottish election. Arthur and Adam were re-elected in 2021 winning over half the vote in their respective seats, while Mackay was replaced by Renfrewshire Councillor Natalie Don.

Renfrewshire is also contained with the West Scotland which elects seven additional members.

===Referendum results===
A majority of Renfrewshire rejected independence in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, although with 55,466 (47.2%) votes cast in favour and 62,067 (52.8%) against, the &quot;Yes&quot; vote was higher than the national result. The turnout was 117,612 or 87.3%, the highest recorded in the democratic era.

With a turnout of 69.2% (88,197), Renfrewshire voted to remain in the 2016 European Union membership referendum with 64.8% (57,119) of votes cast in favour of remaining while 35.2% (31,010) were for leaving. This was the sixth highest vote for &quot;Remain&quot; out of Scotland&#x27;s 32 councils.

==Education==
Renfrewshire contains the University of the West of Scotland, a new university that was granted university status in 1992 as the University of Paisley. Prior to this, the Paisley Technical College and School of Art was a Central Institution or polytechnic. In 2007 the university merged with Bell College, a further education college in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire and the UWS name was adopted. The university today has sites across the west of Scotland, notably also in Ayr and a joint campus in Dumfries; the main campus remains in Paisley.
Further education is provided by Paisley Campus of West College Scotland in Paisley, which caters to around 20,000 students. The college also has sites in Inverclyde and West Dumbartonshire.

Renfrewshire contains eleven state secondary schools: Castlehead High School, Gleniffer High School, Gryffe High School, Johnstone High School, Linwood High School, Paisley Grammar School, Park Mains High School, Renfrew High School, St Andrew&#x27;s Academy, St Benedict&#x27;s High School, and Trinity High School. It also has 51 primary schools and three schools for children with additional support needs.

==Transport==

Renfrewshire is home to Scotland&#x27;s second busiest airport, Glasgow International Airport, at Abbotsinch between Paisley and Renfrew. The presence of the airport and the proximity to Glasgow means that Renfrewshire supports one of the busiest transport infrastructures in Scotland.

The airport is served by the M8 motorway, which terminates in the area, just east of Langbank, and is a major artery between northwest and southwest Scotland, via the Erskine Bridge.

Developments to ease traffic flow have included a lifting of tolls on the Erskine Bridge, original plans to extend the rail network to connect to the airport have been cancelled and the latest suggestion in 2019 is a metro line connecting Paisley to the airport then on to Glasgow via Braehead. Also the M74 extension was completed to handle traffic from Renfrewshire heading south, diverting it away from Glasgow city centre. Renfrewshire also has bus links provided by FirstGroup, McGill&#x27;s Bus Services and other smaller operators.

<text>West Lothian (; ) is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland, bordering (in a clockwise direction) the City of Edinburgh council area, Scottish Borders, South Lanarkshire, North Lanarkshire and Falkirk. The modern council area was formed in 1975 when the historic county of West Lothian, also known as Linlithgowshire, was reshaped substantially as part of local government reforms; some areas that had formerly been part of Midlothian were added to a new West Lothian District within the Region of Lothian, whilst some areas in the north-west were transferred to the Falkirk District and areas in the north-east were transferred to the City of Edinburgh District. In 1996 West Lothian became a unitary authority area, using the same name and territory as in 1975.

West Lothian lies on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth and is predominantly rural, though there were extensive coal, iron, and shale oil mining operations in the 19th and 20th centuries which created distinctive red-spoil heaps (locally known as &quot;bings&quot;) throughout the council area. The old county town was the royal burgh of Linlithgow, but the largest town (and the second-largest town in the Lothian region after Edinburgh) is now Livingston, where West Lothian Council has been based since 2009 having previously used facilities across three sites. Other large towns in the county include Bathgate (a town with medieval origins that developed extensively during the industrial revolution) and the historic mining settlements of Armadale, Fauldhouse, Whitburn, West Calder, Uphall, and Broxburn.

==History==

In 1975, as a result of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, the boundaries of West Lothian were adjusted: the 1973 Act abolished the traditional counties and burghs, instead creating a system of Regions and Districts. West Lothian was made a district of Lothian Region but lost the burgh of Bo&#x27;ness and the district of Bo&#x27;ness to Falkirk District of Central Region, and the burgh of Queensferry and the district of Kirkliston plus part of Winchburgh to the Edinburgh district of Lothian Region. It gained East Calder and West Calder districts from Midlothian. The two-tier system was abolished by the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, and the district of West Lothian was made into a unitary council area named West Lothian Council.

==Government and politics==
===Council===
West Lothian Council is the local authority for the West Lothian area and has 33 elected members. Councillors are generally elected every five years, with the next election falling in Spring 2027.

The current council composition is:

Following the abolition of West Lothian County Council in 1975, the new West Lothian District Council chose to use the former Burgh Chambers of Bathgate Town Council (built in 1966) as its headquarters, extending the building in 1976 and renaming it Lindsay House. The district council retained the county buildings in Linlithgow as additional office space. In November 2009, the new unitary authority, West Lothian Council, centralised its services at the new West Lothian Civic Centre in Livingston.

===Parliamentary representation===
West Lothian is represented in the Scottish Parliament by two constituency members and seven regional members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs).

In the Parliament of the United Kingdom West Lothian is represented by two members of Parliament. Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) Gregor Poynton represents the Livingston constituency. Kirsteen Sullivan represents the Bathgate and Linlithgow (UK Parliament constituency) Until 2024, the area included the Linlithgow and East Falkirk (UK Parliament constituency).

The West Lothian question, referring to whether Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish MPs should be allowed to vote on English laws, is so named because it was supposedly first raised by Tam Dalyell while he was MP for West Lothian.

==Settlements==
The creation of the modern council area in 1975 drastically altered West Lothian&#x27;s boundaries. Significant towns not included in the modern county are the coastal burghs of Bo&#x27;ness and Queensferry and the town of Kirkliston. Large parts of the southern urban area of Livingston which were historically within Midlothian were, however, transferred to West Lothian.

<doc id="143527" wikidata="Q27919292" url="?curid=143527" title="Politics of Edinburgh">
<text>The politics of Edinburgh are expressed in the deliberations and decisions of the City of Edinburgh Council, in elections to the council, the Scottish Parliament and the UK Parliament.

Also, as Scotland&#x27;s capital city, Edinburgh is host to the Scottish Parliament and the main offices of the Scottish Government.

The City of Edinburgh became a unitary council area in 1996, under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, with the boundaries of the post-1975 City of Edinburgh district of the Lothian region.

As one of the unitary local government areas of Scotland, the City of Edinburgh has a defined structure of governance, generally under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, with The City of Edinburgh Council governing on matters of local administration such as housing, planning, local transport, parks and local economic development and regeneration. For such purposes the City of Edinburgh is divided into 17 wards.

The next tier of government is that of the Scottish Parliament, which legislates on matters of Scottish &quot;national interest&quot;, such as healthcare, education, the environment and agriculture, devolved to it by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. For elections to the Scottish Parliament (at the Scottish Parliament Building, in the Holyrood area of Edinburgh), the city area is divided among six Scottish Parliament constituencies, each returning one Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP), and is within the Lothians electoral region.

The Parliament of the United Kingdom (at the Palace of Westminster) legislates on matters such as taxation, foreign policy, defence, employment and trade. For elections to the House of Commons of this parliament, the city area is divided among five United Kingdom Parliamentary constituencies, with each constituency returning one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

On 18 September 2014, Edinburgh voted &quot;No&quot; in the Independence referendum by 61.1% to 38.9% with an 84.4% turnout rate.

==The City of Edinburgh Council==
The current Lord Provost of Edinburgh is Robert Aldridge, who replaced Frank Ross in 2022. In Scotland, the Lord Provost fulfils many similar roles to that of a Mayor in some other countries. Cllr Aldridge has been on the Council since 1984, previously leading the Liberal Democrat group, and was elected unanimously. He was the first Lord Provost to welcome a new monarch (Charles III) to Edinburgh with the Ceremony of the Keys since 1952.

Elections to the Council are held every four/five years electing 63 councillors. The most recent elections took place in May 2022 and the next election will be in May 2027. Prior to May 2022, the Council was controlled by a Labour/Scottish National Party coalition. Following the 2022 election, a minority Labour administration took control, with Cammy Day as the new council leader, replacing former leader Adam McVey. 

As of 2013, the Council was the second-largest employer in Edinburgh, with a total of 18,617 employees.

===Council political composition===


==The Edinburgh Corporation and former local government==

Prior to the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 Edinburgh was administered by the single tier &quot;Edinburgh Corporation&quot;, which covered the &quot;City and Royal Burgh of Edinburgh&quot;. As such, the Edinburgh Corporation was responsible for local government services, such as the Edinburgh Corporation Transport Department (Edinburgh Corporation Tramways until 1928). The Edinburgh Corporation had the power to make &#x27;Burgess&#x27; (freemen) of the City of Edinburgh and to grant &quot;Seals of Cause&quot; to Guilds and trade organisations. The Edinburgh Corporation awarded Burgess Ticket through the Lord Dean of Guild, an office in the Corporation. Like the Corporation of the City of London, Burgess Tickets were often awarded along with a &#x27;Freedom Casket&#x27; – a container to hold the ticket. Bodies such as the Merchant Company of Edinburgh, the Incorporated Trades of Edinburgh and The High Constables of Edinburgh formed part of the corporation, contributing councilors and law enforcement officers. The Edinburgh Corporation had the power to institute these organisations via the granting of a &quot;Seal of Cause&quot;. This empowered the societies as &quot;a legal corporation with power to hold property, make its own by-laws and regulations&quot;. Other organisations to receive the &quot;Seal of Cause&quot; include The Royal Burgess Golfing Society of Edinburgh, who received their seal on 2 July 1800. The history of the corporation lives on elsewhere around the city, for example in the name of the members of Muirfield golf club, who were granted a charter by the corporation in 1800 becoming &quot;The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers&quot;. Many of Edinburgh&#x27;s ceremonies and traditions date back to the days of the Edinburgh Corporation, such as the Edinburgh Ceremony of the Keys, where the Lord Provost symbolically hands the keys to the City of Edinburgh to the monarch, who hands them back to the Lord Provost proclaiming &quot;that they cannot be placed in better hands than those of the Lord Provost and Councillors of my good City of Edinburgh&quot;.

In 1975, Edinburgh Corporation was abolished. The new two-tier system consisted of Lothian Regional Council (with responsibility for water, education, social work and transport) and the City of Edinburgh District Council (with responsibility for cleansing and libraries). The City of Edinburgh became a single-tier council area in 1996, under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, with the boundaries of the City of Edinburgh district of the Lothian region. The district had been created in 1975, under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, to include the former county of city of Edinburgh; the former burgh of Queensferry, the district of Kirkliston and part of Winchburgh formerly within the county of West Lothian; and the district of Currie and the parish of Cramond formerly within the county of Midlothian.

==Parliament of the United Kingdom==
For elections to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the city is divided among five constituencies, each of which elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. All five constituencies are entirely within the city area.

Prior to the 2005 United Kingdom general election, &quot;Edinburgh&quot; House of Commons constituencies had exactly the same names and boundaries as the Scottish Parliament constituencies listed above. However, in order to reduce Scotland&#x27;s historical over representation in the House of Commons, Scotland&#x27;s share of constituencies was reduced from 72 to 59, in accordance with proposals drawn up by the Boundary Commission for Scotland. The Scottish Parliament (Constituencies) Act 2004 enabled Scottish Parliament constituencies to remain unaltered despite new arrangements for House of Commons constituencies, which resulted in the loss of one &quot;Edinburgh&quot; constituency and redrawing of boundaries for the others. As a result of the boundary review:

*Edinburgh Central constituency was abolished and split between the original Edinburgh North and Leith and Edinburgh West constituencies and an entirely new constituency that was created – Edinburgh South West.
*Edinburgh East and Musselburgh took in parts of the Edinburgh North and Leith seat, with the town of Musselburgh being transferred into the East Lothian constituency, with the new seat renamed Edinburgh East.
*Edinburgh Pentlands constituency was also divided between the new Edinburgh South West seat and the existing Edinburgh South seat.
*Edinburgh North and Leith was increased in size by taking in parts of the old Edinburgh Central constituency.
*Edinburgh South was expanded in size taking in elements of the old Edinburgh Pentlands seat.
*Edinburgh South West was an entirely new constituency created for the 2005 UK general election taking in elements of the old Edinburgh Central seat, the original Edinburgh West seat and Edinburgh Pentlands seat.
*Edinburgh West was expanded to include some parts of the defunct Edinburgh Central seat.

Current political composition:

=== Constituencies since 1708 ===

&quot;Edinburgh&quot; has been used in ten different constituency names since 1708, the date of the first election to the Parliament of Great Britain (which was merged into the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1801). There have been up to six &quot;Edinburgh&quot; constituencies at any one time.

Two names, &quot;Edinburgh South&quot; and &quot;Edinburgh West&quot; have been in continuous use since 1885. One name, &quot;Edinburgh East&quot;, also first used in 1885, fell out of use in 1997 and returned to use in 2005.

Survival of a name does not in itself mean that a constituency&#x27;s boundaries have been unaltered.

Lists of constituencies:

==Scottish Parliament==

For elections to the Scottish Parliament, the city is divided among six of the nine constituencies in the Lothian electoral region. Each constituency elects one Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) by the first past the post system of election, and the region elects seven additional members (also called &quot;MSPs&quot;) to produce a form of proportional representation.

Until the 2005 United Kingdom general election, &quot;Edinburgh&quot; Scottish Parliament and Parliament of the United Kingdom constituencies were coterminous (shared the same geographical boundaries). The Scottish Parliament (Constituencies) Act 2004, a piece of United Kingdom Parliament legislation, had removed the link, to enable Scottish Parliament constituencies to retain established boundaries despite the introduction of new boundaries for United Kingdom Parliament constituencies.

In the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, the six &quot;Edinburgh&quot; constituencies elected 4 Scottish National Party MSPs, one Labour and one Liberal Democrat MSP:

The following additional members were elected to represent the Lothian electoral region:

==Scottish Independence referendum, 2014==
At the 2014 Scottish independence referendum voters in Edinburgh rejected independence by a margin of 61.1% No to 38.9% Yes. Turnout was 84.4%. Numerically, Edinburgh had the largest number of No votes out of all 32 council areas in Scotland with 194,638 No votes to 123,927 Yes votes. The difference between the number of Yes and No votes was largest in Edinburgh by comparison to any other council area in Scotland at 70,711. The results were in marked contrast to those in Glasgow, where each of the city&#x27;s constituencies voted Yes.

===Results by UK Parliament constituency===

==UK European Union membership referendum, 2016==

In 2016, Edinburgh voted in the European Union membership referendum. While the United Kingdom as a whole voted to leave the EU, Edinburgh overwhelmingly voted to Remain, giving the ninth highest Remain vote share of any counting area. Only Gibraltar and seven boroughs in London had higher vote shares for Remain.

<doc id="143532" wikidata="Q24771446" url="?curid=143532" title="Pardaxin">
<text>Pardaxin is a peptide produced by the Red Sea sole (P4, P5) and the Pacific Peacock sole (P1, P2, P3) that is used as a shark repellent. It causes lysis of mammalian and bacterial cells, similar to melittin.

==Synthesis==
In the lab, pardaxin is synthesized using an automated peptide synthesizer. Alternatively, the secretions of the Red Sea sole can be collected and purified.

==Functions==

===Antibacterial peptide===
Pardaxin has a helix-hinge-helix structure. This structure is common in peptides that act selectively on bacterial membranes and cytotoxic peptides that lyse mammalian and bacterial cells. Pardaxin shows a significantly lower hemolytic activity towards human red blood cells compared to melittin. The C-terminal tail of pardaxin is responsible for this non-selective activity against the erythrocytes and bacteria. The amphiphilic C-terminal helix is the ion-channel lining segment of the peptide. The N-terminal α-helix is important for the insertion of the peptide to the lipid bilayer of the cell.

The mechanism of pardaxin is dependent on the membrane composition. Pardaxin significantly disrupts lipid bilayers composed of zwitterionic lipids, especially those composed of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC). This suggests a carpet mechanism for cell lysis. The carpet mechanism is when a high density of peptides accumulates on the target membrane surface. The phospholipid displacement changes in fluidity, and the cellular contents leak out. The presence of anionic lipids or cholesterol was found to reduce the peptide&#x27;s ability to disrupt bilayers.

===Shark repellent===
&quot;P. marmoratas&quot; and &quot;P. pavoninus&quot; release pardaxin when threatened by sharks. Pardaxin targets the gills and pharyngeal cavity of the sharks. It results in severe struggling, mouth paralysis, and temporary increase of urea leakage in the gills. This distress is caused by the attack of the cellular membrane of the gills, which causes a large influx of salt ions. Research into creating a commercial shark repellent using pardaxin was discontinued because it dilutes in the water too quickly. It is only effective if sprayed almost directly into a shark&#x27;s mouth.

===Cancer treatment===
Pardaxin inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of human cancer cell lines. Its 33-amino acid structure contains many cationic and amphipathic amino acids. This makes it easier for it to interact with anionic membranes, such as those in tumor cells, which are inherently more acidic because of the acidic environment created by more glycolysis.

Pardaxin initiates caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptosis in human cervical carcinoma cells. Pardaxin triggers reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS production disrupts protein folding and induces the unfolded protein response (UPR). This causes stress on the endoplasmic reticulum, which releases calcium. This leads to an increase in mitochondrial calcium, dropping its membrane potential. The pore permeability changes, and Cytochrome c (Cyt c) is released. Cyt c activates the caspase chain that leads to apoptosis. ROS also activates the JNK pathway. JNK is phosphorylated, which leads to the phosphorylation of AP-1 (transcription factor consisting of cFOS and Cjun). This results in the activation of caspases as well. ROS also causes a caspase independent pathway that results in apoptosis. When the mitochondrial membrane potential changes, apoptosis-inducing factors (AIFs) are also released. These trigger apoptosis when they enter the nucleus, not needing to involve caspases.

<text>The green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a protein that exhibits green fluorescence when exposed to light in the blue to ultraviolet range. The label &quot;GFP&quot; traditionally refers to the protein first isolated from the jellyfish &quot;Aequorea victoria&quot; and is sometimes called &quot;avGFP&quot;. However, GFPs have been found in other organisms including corals, sea anemones, zoanithids, copepods and lancelets.

The GFP from &quot;A. victoria&quot; has a major excitation peak at a wavelength of 395 nm and a minor one at 475 nm. Its emission peak is at 509 nm, which is in the lower green portion of the visible spectrum. The fluorescence quantum yield (QY) of GFP is 0.79. The GFP from the sea pansy (&quot;Renilla reniformis&quot;) has a single major excitation peak at 498 nm. GFP makes for an excellent tool in many forms of biology due to its ability to form an internal chromophore without requiring any accessory cofactors, gene products, or enzymes / substrates other than molecular oxygen.

In cell and molecular biology, the GFP gene is frequently used as a reporter of expression. It has been used in modified forms to make biosensors, and many animals have been created that express GFP, which demonstrates a proof of concept that a gene can be expressed throughout a given organism, in selected organs, or in cells of interest. GFP can be introduced into animals or other species through transgenic techniques, and maintained in their genome and that of their offspring. GFP has been expressed in many species, including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, fish and mammals, including in human cells. Scientists Roger Y. Tsien, Osamu Shimomura, and Martin Chalfie were awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry on 10 October 2008 for their discovery and development of the green fluorescent protein.

Most commercially available genes for GFP and similar fluorescent proteins are around 730 base-pairs long. The natural protein has 238 amino acids. Its molecular mass is 27 kD. Therefore, fusing the GFP gene to the gene of a protein of interest can significantly increase the protein&#x27;s size and molecular mass, and can impair the protein&#x27;s natural function or change its location or trajectory of transport within the cell.

== Background ==


=== Wild-type GFP (wtGFP) ===

In the 1960s and 1970s, GFP, along with the separate luminescent protein aequorin (an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of luciferin, releasing light), was first purified from the jellyfish &quot;Aequorea victoria&quot; and its properties studied by Osamu Shimomura. In &quot;A. victoria&quot;, GFP fluorescence occurs when aequorin interacts with Ca2+ ions, inducing a blue glow. Some of this luminescent energy is transferred to the GFP, shifting the overall color towards green. However, its utility as a tool for molecular biologists did not begin to be realized until 1992 when Douglas Prasher reported the cloning and nucleotide sequence of wtGFP in &quot;Gene&quot;. The funding for this project had run out, so Prasher sent cDNA samples to several labs. The lab of Martin Chalfie expressed the coding sequence of wtGFP, with the first few amino acids deleted, in heterologous cells of &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;C. elegans&quot;, publishing the results in &quot;Science&quot; in 1994. Frederick Tsuji&#x27;s lab independently reported the expression of the recombinant protein one month later. Remarkably, the GFP molecule folded and was fluorescent at room temperature, without the need for exogenous cofactors specific to the jellyfish. Although this near-wtGFP was fluorescent, it had several drawbacks, including dual peaked excitation spectra, pH sensitivity, chloride sensitivity, poor fluorescence quantum yield, poor photostability and poor folding at .

The first reported crystal structure of a GFP was that of the S65T mutant by the Remington group in &quot;Science&quot; in 1996. One month later, the Phillips group independently reported the wild-type GFP structure in &quot;Nature Biotechnology&quot;. These crystal structures provided vital background on chromophore formation and neighboring residue interactions. Researchers have modified these residues by directed and random mutagenesis to produce the wide variety of GFP derivatives in use today. Further research into GFP has shown that it is resistant to detergents, proteases, guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) treatments, and drastic temperature changes.

=== GFP derivatives ===

Due to the potential for widespread usage and the evolving needs of researchers, many different mutants of GFP have been engineered. The first major improvement was a single point mutation (S65T) reported in 1995 in &quot;Nature&quot; by Roger Tsien. This mutation dramatically improved the spectral characteristics of GFP, resulting in increased fluorescence, photostability, and a shift of the major excitation peak to 488 nm, with the peak emission kept at 509 nm. This matched the spectral characteristics of commonly available FITC filter sets, increasing the practicality of use by the general researcher. A 37 °C folding efficiency (F64L) point mutant to this scaffold, yielding enhanced GFP (EGFP), was discovered in 1995 by the laboratories of Thastrup and Falkow. EGFP allowed the practical use of GFPs in mammalian cells. EGFP has an extinction coefficient (denoted ε) of 55,000 M−1cm−1. The fluorescence quantum yield (QY) of EGFP is 0.60. The relative brightness, expressed as ε•QY, is 33,000 M−1cm−1.

Superfolder GFP (sfGFP), a series of mutations that allow GFP to rapidly fold and mature even when fused to poorly folding peptides, was reported in 2006.

Many other mutations have been made, including color mutants; in particular, blue fluorescent protein (EBFP, EBFP2, Azurite, mKalama1), cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP, Cerulean, CyPet, mTurquoise2), and yellow fluorescent protein derivatives (YFP, Citrine, Venus, YPet). BFP derivatives (except mKalama1) contain the Y66H substitution. They exhibit a broad absorption band in the ultraviolet centered close to 380 nanometers and an emission maximum at 448 nanometers. A green fluorescent protein mutant (BFPms1) that preferentially binds Zn(II) and Cu(II) has been developed. BFPms1 have several important mutations including and the BFP chromophore (Y66H),Y145F for higher quantum yield, H148G for creating a hole into the beta-barrel and several other mutations that increase solubility. Zn(II) binding increases fluorescence intensity, while Cu(II) binding quenches fluorescence and shifts the absorbance maximum from 379 to 444 nm. Therefore, they can be used as Zn biosensor.
Chromophore binding. The critical mutation in cyan derivatives is the Y66W substitution, which causes the chromophore to form with an indole rather than phenol component. Several additional compensatory mutations in the surrounding barrel are required to restore brightness to this modified chromophore due to the increased bulk of the indole group. In ECFP and Cerulean, the N-terminal half of the seventh strand exhibits two conformations. These conformations both have a complex set of van der Waals interactions with the chromophore. The Y145A and H148D mutations in Cerulean stabilize these interactions and allow the chromophore to be more planar, better packed, and less prone to collisional quenching.

Additional site-directed random mutagenesis in combination with fluorescence lifetime based screening has further stabilized the seventh β-strand resulting in a bright variant, mTurquoise2, with a quantum yield (QY) of 0.93. The red-shifted wavelength of the YFP derivatives is accomplished by the T203Y mutation and is due to π-electron stacking interactions between the substituted tyrosine residue and the chromophore. These two classes of spectral variants are often employed for Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments. Genetically encoded FRET reporters sensitive to cell signaling molecules, such as calcium or glutamate, protein phosphorylation state, protein complementation, receptor dimerization, and other processes provide highly specific optical readouts of cell activity in real time.

Semirational mutagenesis of a number of residues led to pH-sensitive mutants known as pHluorins, and later super-ecliptic pHluorins. By exploiting the rapid change in pH upon synaptic vesicle fusion, pHluorins tagged to synaptobrevin have been used to visualize synaptic activity in neurons.

Redox sensitive GFP (roGFP) was engineered by introduction of cysteines into the beta barrel structure. The redox state of the cysteines determines the fluorescent properties of roGFP.

=== Nomenclature ===
The nomenclature of modified GFPs is often confusing due to overlapping mapping of several GFP versions onto a single name. For example, mGFP often refers to a GFP with an N-terminal palmitoylation that causes the GFP to bind to cell membranes. However, the same term is also used to refer to monomeric GFP, which is often achieved by the dimer interface breaking A206K mutation. Wild-type GFP has a weak dimerization tendency at concentrations above 5 mg/mL. mGFP also stands for &quot;modified GFP,&quot; which has been optimized through amino acid exchange for stable expression in plant cells.

== In nature ==
The purpose of both the (primary) bioluminescence (from aequorin&#x27;s action on luciferin) and the (secondary) fluorescence of GFP in jellyfish is unknown. GFP is co-expressed with aequorin in small granules around the rim of the jellyfish bell. The secondary excitation peak (480 nm) of GFP does absorb some of the blue emission of aequorin, giving the bioluminescence a more green hue. The serine 65 residue of the GFP chromophore is responsible for the dual-peaked excitation spectra of wild-type GFP. It is conserved in all three GFP isoforms originally cloned by Prasher. Nearly all mutations of this residue consolidate the excitation spectra to a single peak at either 395 nm or 480 nm. The precise mechanism of this sensitivity is complex, but, it seems, involves donation of a hydrogen from serine 65 to glutamate 222, which influences chromophore ionization. Since a single mutation can dramatically enhance the 480 nm excitation peak, making GFP a much more efficient partner of aequorin, &quot;A. victoria&quot; appears to evolutionarily prefer the less-efficient, dual-peaked excitation spectrum. Roger Tsien has speculated that varying hydrostatic pressure with depth may affect serine 65&#x27;s ability to donate a hydrogen to the chromophore and shift the ratio of the two excitation peaks. Thus, the jellyfish may change the color of its bioluminescence with depth. However, a collapse in the population of jellyfish in Friday Harbor, where GFP was originally discovered, has hampered further study of the role of GFP in the jellyfish&#x27;s natural environment.

Most species of lancelet are known to produce GFP in various regions of their body. Unlike &quot;A. victoria&quot;, lancelets do not produce their own blue light, and the origin of their endogenous GFP is still unknown. Some speculate that it attracts plankton towards the mouth of the lancelet, serving as a passive hunting mechanism. It may also serve as a photoprotective agent in the larvae, preventing damage caused by high-intensity blue light by converting it into lower-intensity green light. However, these theories have not been tested.

GFP-like proteins have been found in multiple species of marine copepods, particularly from the Pontellidae and Aetideidae families. GFP isolated from &quot;Pontella mimocerami&quot; has shown high levels of brightness with a quantum yield of 0.92, making them nearly two-fold brighter than the commonly used EGFP isolated from &quot;A. victoria.&quot;

== Other fluorescent proteins ==
There are many GFP-like proteins that, despite being in the same protein family as GFP, are not directly derived from &quot;Aequorea victoria&quot;. These include dsRed, eqFP611, Dronpa, TagRFPs, KFP, EosFP/IrisFP, Dendra, and so on. Having been developed from proteins in different organisms, these proteins can sometimes display unanticipated approaches to chromophore formation. Some of these, such as KFP, are developed from naturally non- or weakly-fluorescent proteins to be greatly improved upon by mutagenesis. When GFP-like barrels of different spectra characteristics are used, the excitation spectra of one chromophore can be used to power another chromophore (FRET), allowing for conversion between wavelengths of light.

FMN-binding fluorescent proteins (FbFPs) were developed in 2007 and are a class of small (11–16 kDa), oxygen-independent fluorescent proteins that are derived from blue-light receptors. They are intended especially for the use under anaerobic or hypoxic conditions, since the formation and binding of the Flavin chromophore does not require molecular oxygen, as it is the case with the synthesis of the GFP chromophore.

Fluorescent proteins with other chromophores, such as UnaG with bilirubin, can display unique properties like red-shifted emission above 600 nm or photoconversion from a green-emitting state to a red-emitting state. They can have excitation and emission wavelengths far enough apart to achieve conversion between red and green light.

A new class of fluorescent protein was evolved from a cyanobacterial (&quot;Trichodesmium erythraeum&quot;) phycobiliprotein, α-allophycocyanin, and named small ultra red fluorescent protein (smURFP) in 2016. smURFP autocatalytically self-incorporates the chromophore biliverdin without the need of an external protein, known as a lyase. Jellyfish- and coral-derived GFP-like proteins require oxygen and produce a stoichiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide upon chromophore formation. smURFP does not require oxygen or produce hydrogen peroxide and uses the chromophore, biliverdin. smURFP has a large extinction coefficient (180,000 M−1 cm−1) and has a modest quantum yield (0.20), which makes it comparable biophysical brightness to eGFP and ~2-fold brighter than most red or far-red fluorescent proteins derived from coral. smURFP spectral properties are similar to the organic dye Cy5.

Reviews on new classes of fluorescent proteins and applications can be found in the cited reviews.

== Structure ==
GFP has a beta barrel structure consisting of eleven β-strands with a pleated sheet arrangement, with an alpha helix containing the covalently bonded chromophore 4-(&quot;p&quot;-hydroxybenzylidene)imidazolidin-5-one (HBI) running through the center. Five shorter alpha helices form caps on the ends of the structure. The beta barrel structure is a nearly perfect cylinder, 42Å long and 24Å in diameter (some studies have reported a diameter of 30Å), creating what is referred to as a &quot;β-can&quot; formation, which is unique to the GFP-like family. HBI, the spontaneously modified form of the tripeptide Ser65–Tyr66–Gly67, is nonfluorescent in the absence of the properly folded GFP scaffold and exists mainly in the un-ionized phenol form in wtGFP. Inward-facing sidechains of the barrel induce specific cyclization reactions in Ser65–Tyr66–Gly67 that induce ionization of HBI to the phenolate form and chromophore formation. This process of post-translational modification is referred to as &quot;maturation&quot;. The hydrogen-bonding network and electron-stacking interactions with these sidechains influence the color, intensity and photostability of GFP and its numerous derivatives. The tightly packed nature of the barrel excludes solvent molecules, protecting the chromophore fluorescence from quenching by water. In addition to the auto-cyclization of the Ser65-Tyr66-Gly67, a 1,2-dehydrogenation reaction occurs at the Tyr66 residue. Besides the three residues that form the chromophore, residues such as Gln94, Arg96, His148, Thr203, and Glu222 all act as stabilizers. The residues of Gln94, Arg96, and His148 are able to stabilize by delocalizing the chromophore charge. Arg96 is the most important stabilizing residue due to the fact that it prompts the necessary structural realignments that are necessary from the HBI ring to occur. Any mutation to the Arg96 residue would result in a decrease in the development rate of the chromophore because proper electrostatic and steric interactions would be lost. Tyr66 is the recipient of hydrogen bonds and does not ionize in order to produce favorable electrostatics.


Blue fluorescent protein (BFP) is the blue variant of green fluorescent protein (GFP). BFP has a very similar structure to GFP. In the BFP structure, two substitution mutations in the amino acid sequence change its fluorescence from green to blue. The first mutation occurs inside the chromophore of GFP at position 66 which changes a tyrosine to a histidine. The other mutation in BFP is on the tyrosine at position 145 which mutates to phenylalanine. The autocatalytic cyclization and oxidation of the serine, tyrosine, and glycine form the GFP chromophore. These three residues at positions 65-67 make up the green fluorescent chromophore. When the tyrosine in the chromophore is substituted by a histidine, it changes the folding structure of the protein and emission spectra. The T145F mutation is also added to increase the stability of the protein and well as intensify the fluorescence. These mutations are what change GFP to BFP.

=== Autocatalytic formation of the chromophore in wtGFP ===

Mechanistically, the process involves base-mediated cyclization followed by dehydration and oxidation. In the reaction of 7a to 8 involves the formation of an enamine from the imine, while in the reaction of 7b to 9 a proton is abstracted. The formed HBI fluorophore is highlighted in green.

The reactions are catalyzed by residues Glu222 and Arg96. An analogous mechanism is also possible with threonine in place of Ser65.

== Applications ==

=== Reporter assays ===

Green fluorescent protein may be used as a reporter gene.

For example, GFP can be used as a reporter for environmental toxicity levels. This protein has been shown to be an effective way to measure the toxicity levels of various chemicals including ethanol, &quot;p&quot;-formaldehyde, phenol, triclosan, and paraben. GFP is great as a reporter protein because it has no effect on the host when introduced to the host&#x27;s cellular environment. Due to this ability, no external visualization stain, ATP, or cofactors are needed. With regards to pollutant levels, the fluorescence was measured in order to gauge the effect that the pollutants have on the host cell. The cellular density of the host cell was also measured. Results from the study conducted by Song, Kim, &amp; Seo (2016) showed that there was a decrease in both fluorescence and cellular density as pollutant levels increased. This was indicative of the fact that cellular activity had decreased. More research into this specific application in order to determine the mechanism by which GFP acts as a pollutant marker. Similar results have been observed in zebrafish because zebrafish that were injected with GFP were approximately twenty times more susceptible to recognize cellular stresses than zebrafish that were not injected with GFP.

==== Advantages ====

The biggest advantage of GFP is that it can be heritable, depending on how it was introduced, allowing for continued study of cells and tissues it is expressed in. Visualizing GFP is noninvasive, requiring only illumination with blue light. GFP alone does not interfere with biological processes, but when fused to proteins of interest, careful design of linkers is required to maintain the function of the protein of interest. Moreover, if used with a monomer it is able to diffuse readily throughout cells.

=== Fluorescence microscopy ===
The availability of GFP and its derivatives has thoroughly redefined fluorescence microscopy and the way it is used in cell biology and other biological disciplines. While most small fluorescent molecules such as FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) are strongly phototoxic when used in live cells, fluorescent proteins such as GFP are usually much less harmful when illuminated in living cells. This has triggered the development of highly automated live-cell fluorescence microscopy systems, which can be used to observe cells over time expressing one or more proteins tagged with fluorescent proteins.

There are many techniques to utilize GFP in a live cell imaging experiment. The most direct way of utilizing GFP is to directly attach it to a protein of interest. For example, GFP can be included in a plasmid expressing other genes to indicate a successful transfection of a gene of interest. Another method is to use a GFP that contains a mutation where the fluorescence will change from green to yellow over time, which is referred to as a fluorescent timer. With the fluorescent timer, researchers can study the state of protein production such as recently activated, continuously activated, or recently deactivated based on the color reported by the fluorescent protein. In yet another example, scientists have modified GFP to become active only after exposure to irradiation giving researchers a tool to selectively activate certain portions of a cell and observe where proteins tagged with the GFP move from the starting location. These are only two examples in a burgeoning field of fluorescent microcopy and a more complete review of biosensors utilizing GFP and other fluorescent proteins can be found here 

For example, GFP had been widely used in labelling the spermatozoa of various organisms for identification purposes as in &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, where expression of GFP can be used as a marker for a particular characteristic. GFP can also be expressed in different structures enabling morphological distinction. In such cases, the gene for the production of GFP is incorporated into the genome of the organism in the region of the DNA that codes for the target proteins and that is controlled by the same regulatory sequence; that is, the gene&#x27;s regulatory sequence now controls the production of GFP, in addition to the tagged protein(s). In cells where the gene is expressed, and the tagged proteins are produced, GFP is produced at the same time. Thus, only those cells in which the tagged gene is expressed, or the target proteins are produced, will fluoresce when observed under fluorescence microscopy. Analysis of such time lapse movies has redefined the understanding of many biological processes including protein folding, protein transport, and RNA dynamics, which in the past had been studied using fixed (i.e., dead) material. Obtained data are also used to calibrate mathematical models of intracellular systems and to estimate rates of gene expression. Similarly, GFP can be used as an indicator of protein expression in heterologous systems. In this scenario, fusion proteins containing GFP are introduced indirectly, using RNA of the construct, or directly, with the tagged protein itself. This method is useful for studying structural and functional characteristics of the tagged protein on a macromolecular or single-molecule scale with fluorescence microscopy.

The Vertico SMI microscope using the SPDM Phymod technology uses the so-called &quot;reversible photobleaching&quot; effect of fluorescent dyes like GFP and its derivatives to localize them as single molecules in an optical resolution of 10 nm. This can also be performed as a co-localization of two GFP derivatives (2CLM).

Another powerful use of GFP is to express the protein in small sets of specific cells. This allows researchers to optically detect specific types of cells &quot;in vitro&quot; (in a dish), or even &quot;in vivo&quot; (in the living organism). GFP is considered to be a reliable reporter of gene expression in eukaryotic cells when the fluorescence is measured by flow cytometry. Genetically combining several spectral variants of GFP is a useful trick for the analysis of brain circuitry (Brainbow). Other interesting uses of fluorescent proteins in the literature include using FPs as sensors of neuron membrane potential, tracking of AMPA receptors on cell membranes, viral entry and the infection of individual influenza viruses and lentiviral viruses, etc.

It has also been found that new lines of transgenic GFP rats can be relevant for gene therapy as well as regenerative medicine. By using &quot;high-expresser&quot; GFP, transgenic rats display high expression in most tissues, and many cells that have not been characterized or have been only poorly characterized in previous GFP-transgenic rats.

GFP has been shown to be useful in cryobiology as a viability assay. Correlation of viability as measured by trypan blue assays were 0.97. Another application is the use of GFP co-transfection as internal control for transfection efficiency in mammalian cells.

A novel possible use of GFP includes using it as a sensitive monitor of intracellular processes via an eGFP laser system made out of a human embryonic kidney cell line. The first engineered living laser is made by an eGFP expressing cell inside a reflective optical cavity and hitting it with pulses of blue light. At a certain pulse threshold, the eGFP&#x27;s optical output becomes brighter and completely uniform in color of pure green with a wavelength of 516 nm. Before being emitted as laser light, the light bounces back and forth within the resonator cavity and passes the cell numerous times. By studying the changes in optical activity, researchers may better understand cellular processes.

GFP is used widely in cancer research to label and track cancer cells. GFP-labelled cancer cells have been used to model metastasis, the process by which cancer cells spread to distant organs.

=== Split GFP ===
GFP can be used to analyse the colocalization of proteins. This is achieved by &quot;splitting&quot; the protein into two fragments which are able to self-assemble, and then fusing each of these to the two proteins of interest. Alone, these incomplete GFP fragments are unable to fluoresce. However, if the two proteins of interest colocalize, then the two GFP fragments assemble together to form a GFP-like structure which is able to fluoresce. Therefore, by measuring the level of fluorescence it is possible to determine whether the two proteins of interest colocalize.

=== Macro-photography ===
Macro-scale biological processes, such as the spread of virus infections, can be followed using GFP labeling. In the past, mutagenic ultra violet light (UV) has been used to illuminate living organisms (e.g., see) to detect and photograph the GFP expression. Recently, a technique using non-mutagenic LED lights have been developed for macro-photography. The technique uses an epifluorescence camera attachment based on the same principle used in the construction of epifluorescence microscopes.

=== Transgenic pets ===

Alba, a green-fluorescent rabbit, was created by a French laboratory commissioned by Eduardo Kac using GFP for purposes of art and social commentary. The US company Yorktown Technologies markets to aquarium shops green fluorescent zebrafish (GloFish) that were initially developed to detect pollution in waterways. NeonPets, a US-based company has marketed green fluorescent mice to the pet industry as NeonMice. Green fluorescent pigs, known as Noels, were bred by a group of researchers led by Wu Shinn-Chih at the Department of Animal Science and Technology at National Taiwan University. A Japanese-American Team created green-fluorescent cats as proof of concept to use them potentially as model organisms for diseases, particularly HIV. In 2009 a South Korean team from Seoul National University bred the first transgenic beagles with fibroblast cells from sea anemones. The dogs give off a red fluorescent light, and they are meant to allow scientists to study the genes that cause human diseases like narcolepsy and blindness.

=== Art ===

Julian Voss-Andreae, a German-born artist specializing in &quot;protein sculptures,&quot; created sculptures based on the structure of GFP, including the tall &quot;Green Fluorescent Protein&quot; (2004) and the tall &quot;Steel Jellyfish&quot; (2006). The latter sculpture is located at the place of GFP&#x27;s discovery by Shimomura in 1962, the University of Washington&#x27;s Friday Harbor Laboratories.

== Episodes ==
==Production==
The series was first announced by DualStar and the then-Disney-owned DIC Entertainment in March 1999. Initially, the series was going to be based on the Trenchcoat Twins personas.

By 2000, the series had become a co-production of DIC and Canal J, under the tentative title Action Girls. 52 episodes were tentatively planned for the series.

After its premiere on ABC in the United States, in November 2001, DIC pre-sold the series internationally to CITV (and later Nickelodeon as well) in the UK, Canal J in France, Mediaset in Italy, YTV in Canada and Fox Kids Latin America.

In April 2002, Televisa in Mexico and RTÉ in Ireland purchased broadcast rights to the series in their respective countries.

==Broadcast==
From September 2002 – 2003, following the channel&#x27;s rebrand, Toon Disney reaired the series alongside other ex-One Saturday Morning shows.

In April 2015, Nickelodeon acquired several US broadcast rights to DualStar&#x27;s content library, including this series, although it was never re-ran on the channel.

== DVD releases ==
In June 2005, Warner Home Video released a single-disc volume called &quot;Misty and Amber vs. Renee la Rouge&quot;, featuring 5 episodes of the series focusing on the villain Renee la Rouge. The episodes come with English, Spanish and French audio tracks, as well as featuring a Trivia Challenge and a Villain Bio as bonus features.

In 2016, the series was released to iTunes, but it contained the same episodes only available on the Volume 1 DVD.

== Books ==
The series spun-off a series of books published by Dualstar Books and HarperEntertainment in 2002. In the books, the twins are special agents assigned to solve different mysteries around the fashion and sports world, and have to travel to such cities as New York City, Paris, and Rome to do it.

The series includes:
* Book number 1: &quot;Makeup Shakeup&quot;. Setting: New York and Paris.
* Book number 2: &quot;The Dream Team&quot;. Setting: Rome.
* Book number 3: &quot;Fubble Bubble Trouble&quot;. Setting: &quot;The Mall of Malls&quot;, a fictional mall that appears to be based on the Mall of America
* Book number 4: &quot;Operation Evaporation&quot;. Setting: Bermuda.
* Book number 5: &quot;Dog Gone Mess&quot;: Setting: Germany.
* Book number 6: &quot;The Music Meltdown&quot;. Setting: Washington, D.C.
* Book number 7: &quot;Password: Red Hot&quot; Setting: England.
* Book number 8: &quot;Fast Food Fight&quot; Setting: Anytown, USA

<text>The poinsettia (; &quot;Euphorbia pulcherrima&quot;) is a commercially important flowering plant species of the diverse spurge family Euphorbiaceae. Indigenous to Mexico and Central America, the poinsettia was first described by Europeans in 1834. It is particularly well known for its red and green foliage and is widely used in Christmas floral displays. It derives its common English name from Joel Roberts Poinsett, the first United States minister to Mexico, who is credited with introducing the plant to the US in the 1820s. Poinsettias are shrubs or small trees, with heights of . Though often stated to be highly toxic, the poinsettia is not dangerous to pets or children. Exposure to the plant, even consumption, most often results in no effect, though it can cause nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

Wild poinsettias occur from Mexico to southern Guatemala, growing on mid-elevation, Pacific-facing slopes. One population in the Mexican state of Guerrero is much further inland, however, and is thought to be the ancestor of most cultivated populations. Wild poinsettia populations are highly fragmented, as their habitat is experiencing largely unregulated deforestation. They were cultivated by the Aztecs for use in traditional medicine. They became associated with the Christmas holiday and are popular seasonal decorations. Every year in the United States, approximately 70 million poinsettias of many cultivated varieties are sold in a six-week period. Many of these poinsettias are grown by Paul Ecke Ranch, which serves half the worldwide market and 70 percent of the US market.

==Taxonomy==
The poinsettia was described as a new species in 1834 by the German scientist Johann Friedrich Klotzsch. Klotzsch credited Carl Ludwig Willdenow with the species name &quot;pulcherrima&quot;, and the authority is given as Willd. ex Klotzsch. The holotype had been collected in Mexico during an 1803–1804 expedition by Alexander von Humboldt and Aimé Bonpland.

It was known by the common name &quot;poinsettia&quot; as early as 1836, derived from Joel Roberts Poinsett, a botanist and the first US Minister to Mexico. Possibly as early as 1826, Poinsett began sending poinsettias from Mexico back to his greenhouses in South Carolina. Prior to poinsettia, it was known as &quot;Mexican flame flower&quot; or &quot;painted leaf&quot;.

== Description ==
&quot;Euphorbia pulcherrima&quot; is a shrub or small tree, typically reaching a height of . The plant bears dark green dentate leaves that measure in length. The colored bracts—which are normally flaming red, with cultivars being orange, pale green, cream, pink, white, or marbled—are often mistaken for flower petals because of their groupings and colors, but are actually leaves. The colors of the bracts are created through photoperiodism, meaning that they require darkness (at least fourteen hours at a time for 6–8 weeks in a row) to change color. The plants also require abundant light during the day for the brightest color. Semi-evergreen, they generally lose most of their leaves during winter.

The flowers of the poinsettia are unassuming. They are grouped within the cyathia (small yellow structures found in the center of each leaf bunch, or false flowers). Nothing is known about pollination in wild poinsettias, though wasps are noted to occasionally visit the cyathia. All flowers in the Euphorbiaceae are unisexual (either male or female only), and they are often very small in size. In &quot;Euphorbia&quot;, the flowers are reduced even more and then aggregated into an inflorescence or cluster of flowers.

==Toxicity==

Poinsettias are popularly, though incorrectly, said to be toxic to humans and other animals. This misconception was spread by a 1919 urban legend of a two-year-old child dying after consuming a poinsettia leaf. In 1944, the plant was included in H. R. Arnold&#x27;s book &quot;Poisonous Plants of Hawaii&quot; on this premise. Though Arnold later admitted that the story was hearsay and that poinsettias were not proven to be poisonous, the plant was thus thought deadly. In 1970 the US Food and Drug Administration published a newsletter stating erroneously that &quot;one poinsettia leaf can kill a child&quot;, and in 1980 they were prohibited from nursing homes in a county in North Carolina due to this supposed toxicity.

An attempt to determine a poisonous dose of poinsettia to rats failed, even after reaching experimental doses equivalent to consuming 500 leaves, or nearly of sap. Contact with any part of the plant by children or pets often has no effect, though it may cause nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting if swallowed. External exposure to the plant may result in a skin rash for some. A survey of more than 20,000 calls to the American Association of Poison Control Centers from 1985–1992 related to poinsettia exposure showed no fatalities. In 92.4% of calls, there was no effect from exposure, and in 3.4% of calls there were minor effects, defined as &quot;minimally bothersome&quot;. Similarly, a cat or dog&#x27;s exposure to poinsettias rarely necessitates medical treatment. If ingested, mild drooling or vomiting can occur, or rarely, diarrhea. In rare cases, exposure to the eye may result in eye irritation. Skin exposure to the sap may cause itchiness, redness, or swelling. It can induce asthma and allergic rhinitis in certain groups of people.

==Chemical composition==
Pulcherrol and pulcherryl acetate are among the components of its latex. Triterpenes are found in aerial parts of the plant, including its latex and leaves. One such triterpenoid skeleton is being investigated for its anti-Alzheimer&#x27;s disease bioactivity.

==Range and habitat==
The poinsettia occurs in North and Central America, from Mexico to southern Guatemala. Its range is about long, encompassing mid-elevation tropical dry forests. Most wild populations are on Pacific-facing slopes in steep canyons. Populations were once found in rolling hill areas, though many have gone extinct. It has been hypothesized that the inaccessibility of the canyons may protect the wild populations from human disturbance. There is a somewhat anomalous population of wild poinsettias in the northern part of the Mexican state of Guerrero and Oaxaca, which is much further inland in the hot and seasonally dry forests than the rest of the species&#x27; range. Genetic analyses showed that the wild populations in northern Guerrero are the likely ancestors of most cultivated poinsettias.

==Conservation==
The tropical dry forests where wild poinsettias grow experience largely unregulated deforestation, resulting in habitat loss. Its natural habitat is thus highly fragmented, particularly near metropolitan areas such as Taxco. Population sizes are frequently very small, with as few as a dozen individuals. Populations can be up to several hundred individuals, but this is not typical. A conservation risk typical for species with wild and cultivated populations is the contamination of the wild gene pool by hybridization with cultivated individuals. This has not been documented in wild poinsettias, though, as cultivars seldom flower and do not produce fruits. As of 2012, wild poinsettias were not protected by Mexican law.

==In culture==
Aztec people use the plant to produce red dye and as an antipyretic medication. In Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, the plant is called , meaning &quot;flower that grows in residues or soil&quot;, or, literally, &quot;excrement flower&quot;, because: &quot;Birds would eat the seeds and deposit them somewhere, and so it seemed that the seeds would germinate and grow from bird droppings.&quot; Today it is known in Mexico and Guatemala as or simply , meaning &quot;Christmas Eve flower&quot;. In Spain it is known as or , meaning &quot;Easter flower&quot;. In Chile and Peru, the plant became known as the &quot;crown of the Andes&quot;.

From the 17th century, friars of the Franciscan Christian religious order in Mexico included the plants in their Christmas celebrations. The star-shaped leaf pattern is said to symbolize the Star of Bethlehem, the red color represents the blood shed during the sacrifice of Jesus&#x27; crucifixion, and the white leaves represent the purity of Jesus. The use of the poinsetta during Christmastide is additionally related to a Christian folk story in Mexico about a poor girl named Pepita:

Poinsettias are popular Christmas decorations in homes, churches, offices, and elsewhere across North America, as a result of an extensive marketing campaign by the Ecke family that began by shipping free poinsettias to television stations for use on-air. In the US, December 12 is National Poinsettia Day, marking the anniversary of Joel Roberts Poinsett&#x27;s death.

==Cultivation==

The Aztecs were the first to cultivate poinsettias. Cultivation in the US began when diplomat Joel Roberts Poinsett sent some of the plants back to his greenhouses in South Carolina in the 1820s. Specific details about its spread from there are largely unverifiable, but it was exhibited at the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society&#x27;s 1829 Philadelphia Flower Show by Colonel Robert Carr. Carr described it as &quot;a new &quot;Euphorbia&quot; with bright scarlet bracts or floral leaves, presented to the Bartram Collection by Mr. Poinsett, United States Minister of Mexico.&quot;

The poinsettia is the world&#x27;s most economically important potted plant. Each year in the US, approximately 70 million poinsettias are sold in a period of six weeks, at a value of US$250 million. In Puerto Rico, where poinsettias are grown extensively in greenhouses, the industry is valued at $5 million annually. There are over 100 cultivated varieties of poinsettia that have been patented in the US.

To produce extra axillary buds that are necessary for plants containing multiple flowers, a phytoplasma infection—whose symptoms include the proliferation of axillary buds—is used. The discovery of the role phytoplasmas play in the growth of axillary buds is credited to Ing-Ming Lee of the USDA Agricultural Research Service.

===American industry===
Albert Ecke emigrated from Germany to Los Angeles in 1900, opening a dairy and orchard in the Eagle Rock area. He became intrigued by the plant and sold them from street stands. His son, Paul Ecke, developed the grafting technique, but it was the third generation of Eckes, Paul Ecke Jr., who was responsible for advancing the association between the plant and Christmas.

Besides changing the market from mature plants shipped by rail to cuttings sent by air, he sent free plants to television stations for them to display on air from Thanksgiving to Christmas. He also appeared on television programs like &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and Bob Hope&#x27;s Christmas specials to promote the plants.

Until the 1990s, the Ecke family, who had moved their operation to Encinitas, California, in 1923, had a virtual monopoly on poinsettias owing to a technique that made their plants much more attractive. They produced a fuller, more compact plant by grafting two varieties of poinsettia together. A poinsettia left to grow on its own will naturally take an open, somewhat weedy look. The Eckes&#x27; technique made it possible to get every seedling to branch, resulting in a bushier plant.

In the late 1980s, university researcher John Dole discovered the grafting method (grafting rarer densely-branched cultivars onto more common sparsely-branched cultivars) – previously known only to the Eckes – and published it. This allowed competitors to flourish, particularly those using low-cost labor in Latin America. The Ecke family&#x27;s business, now led by Paul Ecke III, decided to stop producing plants in the US, but as of 2008, they still served about 70 percent of the domestic market and 50 percent of the worldwide market.

===Diseases===

Poinsettias are susceptible to several diseases, mostly fungal, but also bacterial and parasitic. Conditions that promote poinsettia propagation also favor certain diseases. Fungal diseases affecting greenhouse poinsettia operations include &quot;Pythium&quot; root rot, &quot;Rhizoctonia&quot; root and stem rot, black root rot, scab, powdery mildew, and &quot;Botrytis&quot; blight. Bacterial diseases include bacterial soft rot and bacterial canker, while a viral disease is &quot;Poinsettia mosaic virus&quot;. Infection by poinsettia branch-inducing phytoplasma is actually desirable, as it keeps the plants shorter with more flowers. It is the first known phytoplasma that has economically advantageous effects.

<text>The Whiskey Rebellion (also known as the Whiskey Insurrection) was a violent tax protest in the United States beginning in 1791 and ending in 1794 during the presidency of George Washington. The so-called &quot;whiskey tax&quot; was the first tax imposed on a domestic product by the newly formed federal government. The &quot;whiskey tax&quot; became law in 1791, and was intended to generate revenue to pay the war debt incurred during the American Revolutionary War. Farmers of the western frontier were accustomed to distilling their surplus rye, barley, wheat, corn, or fermented grain mixtures to make whiskey. These farmers resisted the tax.

Throughout western Pennsylvania counties, protesters used violence and intimidation to prevent federal officials from collecting the tax. Resistance came to a climax in July 1794, when a US marshal arrived in western Pennsylvania to serve writs to distillers who had not paid the excise. The alarm was raised, and more than 500 armed men attacked the fortified home of tax inspector John Neville. Washington responded by sending peace commissioners to western Pennsylvania to negotiate with the rebels, while at the same time calling on governors to send a militia force to enforce the tax. Washington himself rode at the head of an army to suppress the insurgency, with 13,000 militiamen provided by the governors of Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The leaders of the rebels all fled before the arrival of the army, and there was no confrontation. About 150 men were arrested, but only 20 held for trial in Philadelphia, and only two were convicted (eventually pardoned).

The Whiskey Rebellion demonstrated that the new national government had the will and ability to suppress violent resistance to its laws, though the whiskey excise remained difficult to collect. The events contributed to the formation of political parties in the United States, a process already under way. The whiskey tax was repealed in the early 1800s during the Jefferson administration.

== Whiskey tax ==
A new U.S. federal government began operating in 1789, following the ratification of the United States Constitution. The previous central government under the Articles of Confederation had been unable to levy taxes; it had borrowed money to meet expenses and fund the Revolutionary War, accumulating $54 million in debt. The state governments had amassed an additional $25 million in debt. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton sought to use this debt to create a financial system that would promote American prosperity and national unity. In his &quot;Report on Public Credit&quot;, he urged Congress to consolidate the state and national debts into a single debt that would be funded by the federal government. Congress approved these measures in June and July 1790.

A source of government revenue was needed to pay the respectable amount due to the previous bondholders to whom the debt was owed. By December 1790, Hamilton believed that import duties, which were the government&#x27;s primary source of revenue, had been raised as high as feasible. He therefore promoted passage of an excise tax on domestically produced distilled spirits. This was to be the first tax levied by the national government on a domestic product. The transportation costs per gallon were higher for farmers removed from eastern urban centers, so the per-gallon profit was reduced disproportionately by the per-gallon tax on distillation of domestic alcohol such as whiskey. The tax applied to all distilled spirits, but consumption of American whiskey was rapidly expanding in the late 18th century, so the excise became widely known as a &quot;whiskey tax&quot;. Taxes were politically unpopular, and Hamilton believed that the whiskey excise was a luxury tax and would be the least objectionable tax that the government could levy. In this, he had the support of some social reformers, who hoped that a &quot;sin tax&quot; would raise public awareness about the harmful effects of alcohol. The whiskey excise act, sometimes known as the &quot;Whiskey Act&quot;, became law in March 1791. George Washington defined the revenue districts, appointed the revenue supervisors and inspectors, and set their pay in November 1791.

== Western grievances ==

The population of Western Pennsylvania was 75,000 in 1790. Among the farmers in the region, the whiskey excise was immediately controversial, with many people on the frontier arguing that it unfairly targeted westerners. Whiskey was a popular drink, and farmers often supplemented their incomes by operating small stills. Farmers living west of the Appalachian Mountains distilled their excess grain into whiskey, which was easier and more profitable to transport over the mountains than the more cumbersome grain. A whiskey tax would make western farmers less competitive with eastern grain producers. Additionally, cash, which at this time consisted of specie (gold and silver coins), was always in short supply on the frontier, nevertheless the law explicitly stipulated the tax could only be paid in specie. In lieu of specie, whiskey often served as a medium of exchange, which for poorer people who were paid in whiskey meant the excise was essentially an income tax that wealthier easterners did not have to pay.
Many of the resisters were war veterans who believed that they were fighting for the principles of the American Revolution, in particular against taxation without local representation, while the federal government maintained that the taxes were the legal expression of Congressional taxation powers.

Small-scale farmers also protested that Hamilton&#x27;s excise effectively gave unfair tax breaks to large distillers, most of whom were based in the east. There were two methods of paying the whiskey excise: paying a flat fee (per still) or paying by the gallon. Large distilleries produced whiskey in volume and could afford the flat fee. The more efficient they became, the less tax per gallon they would pay (as low as 6 cents, according to Hamilton). Western farmers who owned small stills did not typically have either enough time nor enough surplus grain to operate them year-round at full capacity, so they ended up paying a higher tax per gallon (9 cents), which made them less competitive. The regressive nature of the tax was further compounded by an additional factor: whiskey sold for considerably less on the cash-poor Western frontier than in the wealthier and more populous East. This meant that, even if all distillers had been required to pay the same amount of tax per gallon, the small-scale frontier distillers would still have to remit a considerably larger proportion of their product&#x27;s value than larger Eastern distillers. Less-educated farmers, who in this era were often illiterate, also feared they would be cheated by corrupt tax collectors. Small-scale distillers believed that Hamilton deliberately designed the tax to ruin them and promote big business, a view endorsed by some historians. However, historian Thomas Slaughter argued that a &quot;conspiracy of this sort is difficult to document&quot;. Whether by design or not, large distillers recognized the advantage that the excise gave them and they supported it.

Other aspects of the excise law also caused concern. The law required all stills to be registered, and those cited for failure to pay the tax had to appear in distant federal courts, rather than local courts. The only federal courthouse was in Philadelphia, some away from the small frontier settlement of Pittsburgh. From the beginning, the federal government had little success in collecting the whiskey tax along the frontier. Many small western distillers simply refused to pay the tax. Federal revenue officers and local residents who assisted them bore the brunt of the protesters&#x27; ire. Tax rebels harassed several whiskey tax collectors and threatened or beat those who offered them office space or housing. As a result, many western counties never had a resident federal tax official.

In addition to the whiskey tax, westerners had a number of other grievances with the national government, chief among which was the perception that the government was not adequately protecting the residents living in the western frontier. The Northwest Indian War was going badly for the United States, with major losses in 1791. Furthermore, westerners were prohibited by Spain (which then owned Louisiana) from using the Mississippi River for commercial navigation. Until these issues were addressed, westerners felt that the government was ignoring their security and economic welfare. Adding the whiskey excise to these existing grievances only increased tensions on the frontier.

== Resistance ==
Many residents of the western frontier petitioned against passage of the whiskey excise. When that failed, some western Pennsylvanians organized extralegal conventions to advocate repeal of the law. Opposition to the tax was particularly prevalent in four southwestern counties: Allegheny, Fayette, Washington, and Westmoreland. A preliminary meeting held on July 27, 1791, at Redstone Old Fort in Fayette County called for the selection of delegates to a more formal assembly, which convened in Pittsburgh in early September 1791. The Pittsburgh convention was dominated by moderates such as Hugh Henry Brackenridge, who hoped to prevent the outbreak of violence. The convention sent a petition for redress of grievances to the Pennsylvania Assembly and the U.S. House of Representatives, both located in Philadelphia. As a result of this and other petitions, the excise law was modified in May 1792. Changes included a 1-cent reduction in the tax that was advocated by William Findley, a congressman from western Pennsylvania, but the new excise law was still unsatisfactory to many westerners.

Appeals to nonviolent resistance were unsuccessful. On September 11, 1791, a recently appointed tax collector named Robert Johnson was tarred and feathered by a disguised gang in Washington County. A man sent by officials to serve court warrants to Johnson&#x27;s attackers was whipped, tarred, and feathered. Because of these and other violent attacks, the tax went uncollected in 1791 and early 1792. The attackers modeled their actions on the protests of the American Revolution. Supporters of the excise argued that there was a difference between taxation without representation in colonial America, and a tax laid by the elected representatives of the American people.

Older accounts of the Whiskey Rebellion portrayed it as being confined to western Pennsylvania, yet there was opposition to the whiskey tax in the western counties of every other state in Appalachia (Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia). The whiskey tax went uncollected throughout the frontier state of Kentucky, where no one could be convinced to enforce the law or prosecute evaders. In 1792, Hamilton advocated military action to suppress violent resistance in western North Carolina, but Attorney General Edmund Randolph argued that there was insufficient evidence to legally justify such a reaction.

In August 1792, a second convention was held in Pittsburgh to discuss resistance to the whiskey tax. This meeting was more radical than the first convention; moderates such as Brackenridge and Findley were not in attendance. Future Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin was one moderate who did attend, to his later regret. A militant group known as the Mingo Creek Association dominated the convention and issued radical demands. As some of them had done in the American Revolution, they raised liberty poles, formed committees of correspondence, and took control of the local militia. They created an extralegal court and discouraged lawsuits for debt collection and foreclosures.

Hamilton regarded the second Pittsburgh convention as a serious threat to the operation of the laws of the federal government. In September 1792, he sent Pennsylvania tax official George Clymer to western Pennsylvania to investigate. Clymer only increased tensions with a clumsy attempt at traveling in disguise and attempting to intimidate local officials. His somewhat exaggerated report greatly influenced the decisions made by the Washington administration. Washington and Hamilton viewed resistance to federal laws in Pennsylvania as particularly embarrassing, since the national capital was then located in the same state. On his own initiative, Hamilton drafted a presidential proclamation denouncing resistance to the excise laws and submitted it to Attorney General Randolph, who toned down some of the language. Washington signed the proclamation on September 15, 1792, and it was published as a broadsheet and printed in many newspapers.

Federal tax inspector for western Pennsylvania General John Neville was determined to enforce the excise law. He was a prominent politician and wealthy planter—and also a large-scale distiller. He had initially opposed the whiskey tax, but subsequently changed his mind, a reversal that angered some western Pennsylvanians. In August 1792, Neville rented a room in Pittsburgh for his tax office, but the landlord turned him out after being threatened with violence by the Mingo Creek Association. From this point on, tax collectors were not the only people targeted in Pennsylvania; those who cooperated with federal tax officials also faced harassment. Anonymous notes and newspaper articles signed by &quot;Tom the &quot; threatened those who complied with the whiskey tax. Those who failed to heed the warnings might have their barns burned or their stills destroyed.

Resistance to the excise tax continued through 1793 in the frontier counties of Appalachia. Opposition remained especially strident in western Pennsylvania. In June, Neville was burned in effigy by a crowd of about 100 people in Washington County. On the night of November 22, 1793, men broke into the home of tax collector Benjamin Wells in Fayette County. Wells was, like Neville, one of the wealthier men in the region. At gunpoint, the intruders forced him to surrender his commission. President Washington offered a reward for the arrest of the assailants, to no avail.

In addition to the unrest in Fayette county, on August 9, 1794, 30 men surrounded the house of William McCleery, the local tax collector in Morgantown, Virginia, as retaliation for the new whiskey taxes. McCleery felt threatened enough by the angry mob to disguise himself as a slave, flee from his home and swim across the river to safety. The subsequent three-day siege of Morgantown by outsiders and townspeople led state authorities to fear that the events would influence other frontier counties to join the anti-tax movement.

== Insurrection ==
The resistance came to a climax in 1794. In May of that year, federal district attorney William Rawle issued subpoenas for more than 60 distillers in Pennsylvania who had not paid the excise tax. Under the law then in effect, distillers who received these writs would be obligated to travel to Philadelphia to appear in federal court. For farmers on the western frontier, such a journey was expensive, time-consuming, and beyond their means. At the urging of William Findley, Congress modified this law on June 5, 1794, allowing excise trials to be held in local state courts. But by that time, U.S. marshal David Lenox had already been sent to serve the writs summoning delinquent distillers to Philadelphia. Attorney General William Bradford later maintained that the writs were meant to compel compliance with the law, and that the government did not actually intend to hold trials in Philadelphia.

The timing of these events later proved to be controversial. Findley was a bitter political foe of Hamilton, and he maintained in his book on the insurrection that the treasury secretary had deliberately provoked the uprising by issuing the subpoenas just before the law was made less onerous. In 1963, historian Jacob Cooke, an editor of Hamilton&#x27;s papers, regarded this charge as &quot;preposterous&quot;, calling it a &quot;conspiracy thesis&quot; that overstated Hamilton&#x27;s control of the federal government. In 1986, historian Thomas Slaughter argued that the outbreak of the insurrection at this moment was due to &quot;a string of ironic coincidences&quot;, although &quot;the question about motives must always remain&quot;. In 2006, William Hogeland, who is generally critical of Hamilton&#x27;s role in American history, argued that Hamilton, Bradford, and Rawle intentionally pursued a course of action that would provoke &quot;the kind of violence that would justify federal military suppression&quot;. Hogeland claimed that Hamilton had been working towards this moment since the Newburgh Crisis in 1783, where he conceived of using military force to crush popular resistance to direct taxation in the same vein as the Whiskey Rebellion. Historian S. E. Morison believed that Hamilton, in general, wished to enforce the excise law &quot;more as a measure of social discipline than as a source of revenue&quot;.

=== Battle of Bower Hill ===
Federal Marshal Lenox delivered most of the writs without incident. On July 15, he was joined on his rounds by General Neville, who had offered to act as his guide in Allegheny County. That evening, warning shots were fired at the men at the Miller farm, about south of Pittsburgh. Neville returned home while Lenox retreated to Pittsburgh.

On July 16, at least 30 Mingo Creek militiamen surrounded Neville&#x27;s fortified home of Bower Hill. They demanded the surrender of the federal marshal, whom they believed to be inside. Neville responded by firing a gunshot that mortally wounded Oliver Miller, one of the rebels. The rebels opened fire but were unable to dislodge Neville, who had his slaves&#x27; help to defend the house. The rebels retreated to nearby Couch&#x27;s Fort to gather reinforcements.

The next day, the rebels returned to Bower Hill. Their force had swelled to nearly 600 men, now commanded by Major James McFarlane, a veteran of the Revolutionary War. Neville had also received reinforcements: 10 U.S. Army soldiers from Pittsburgh under the command of Major Abraham Kirkpatrick, Neville&#x27;s brother-in-law. Before the rebel force arrived, Kirkpatrick had Neville leave the house and hide in a nearby ravine. David Lenox and General Neville&#x27;s son Presley Neville also returned to the area, though they could not get into the house and were captured by the rebels.

Following some fruitless negotiations, the women and children were allowed to leave the house, and then both sides began firing. After about an hour, McFarlane called a ceasefire; according to some, a white flag had been waved in the house. As McFarlane stepped into the open, a shot rang out from the house, and he fell mortally wounded. The enraged rebels then set fire to the house, including the slave quarters, and Kirkpatrick surrendered. The number of casualties at Bower Hill is unclear; McFarlane and one or two other militiamen were killed; one U.S. soldier may have died from wounds received in the fight. The rebels sent the U.S. soldiers away. Kirkpatrick, Lenox, and Presley Neville were kept as prisoners, but they later escaped.

=== March on Pittsburgh ===

McFarlane was given a hero&#x27;s funeral on July 18. His &quot;murder&quot;, as the rebels saw it, further radicalized the countryside. Moderates such as Brackenridge were hard-pressed to restrain the populace. Radical leaders emerged, such as David Bradford, urging violent resistance. On July 26, a group headed by Bradford robbed the U.S. mail as it left Pittsburgh, hoping to discover who in that town opposed them and finding several letters that condemned the rebels. Bradford and his band called for a military assembly to meet at Braddock&#x27;s Field, about east of Pittsburgh.

On August 1, about 7,000 people gathered at Braddock&#x27;s Field. The crowd consisted primarily of poor people who owned no land, and most did not own whiskey stills. The furor over the whiskey excise had unleashed anger about other economic grievances. By this time, the victims of violence were often wealthy property owners who had no connection to the whiskey tax. Some of the most radical protesters wanted to march on Pittsburgh, which they called &quot;Sodom&quot;, loot the homes of the wealthy, and then burn the town to the ground. Others wanted to attack Fort Fayette. There was praise for the French Revolution and calls for bringing the guillotine to America. David Bradford, it was said, was comparing himself to Robespierre, a leader of the French Reign of Terror.

At Braddock&#x27;s Field, there was talk of declaring independence from the United States and of joining with Spain or Great Britain. Radicals flew a specially designed flag that proclaimed their independence. The flag had six stripes, one for each county represented at the gathering: the Pennsylvania counties of Allegheny, Bedford, Fayette, Washington, and Westmoreland, and Virginia&#x27;s Ohio County.

Pittsburgh citizens helped to defuse the threat by banishing three men whose intercepted letters had given offense to the rebels, and by sending a delegation to Braddock&#x27;s Field that expressed support for the gathering. Brackenridge prevailed upon the crowd to limit the protest to a defiant march through the town. In Pittsburgh, Major Kirkpatrick&#x27;s barns were burned, but nothing else.

=== Meeting at Whiskey Point ===
A convention was held on August 14, 226 whiskey rebels from the six counties, held at Parkinson&#x27;s Ferry (now known as Whiskey Point) in present-day Monongahela. The convention considered resolutions that were drafted by Brackenridge, Gallatin, David Bradford, and an eccentric preacher named Herman Husband, a delegate from Bedford County. Husband was a well-known local figure and a radical champion of democracy who had taken part in the Regulator movement in North Carolina 25 years earlier. The Parkinson&#x27;s Ferry convention also appointed a committee to meet with the peace commissioners who had been sent west by President Washington. There, Gallatin presented an eloquent speech in favor of peace and against proposals from Bradford to further revolt.

=== Federal response ===
President Washington was confronted with what appeared to be an armed insurrection in western Pennsylvania, and he proceeded cautiously while determined to maintain governmental authority. He did not want to alienate public opinion, so he asked his cabinet for written opinions about how to deal with the crisis. The cabinet recommended the use of force, except for Secretary of State Edmund Randolph who urged reconciliation. Washington did both: he sent commissioners to meet with the rebels while raising a militia army. Washington privately doubted that the commissioners could accomplish anything, and believed that a military expedition would be needed to suppress further violence. For this reason, historians have sometimes charged that the peace commission was sent only for the sake of appearances, and that the use of force was never in doubt. Historians Stanley Elkins and Eric McKitrick argued that the military expedition was &quot;itself a part of the reconciliation process&quot;, since a show of overwhelming force would make further violence less likely.

Meanwhile, Hamilton began publishing essays under the name of &quot;Tully&quot; in Philadelphia newspapers, denouncing mob violence in western Pennsylvania and advocating military action. Democratic-Republican Societies had been formed throughout the country, and Washington and Hamilton believed that they were the source of civic unrest. &quot;Historians are not yet agreed on the exact role of the societies&quot; in the Whiskey Rebellion, wrote historian Mark Spencer in 2003, &quot;but there was a degree of overlap between society membership and the Whiskey Rebels&quot;.

Before troops could be raised, the Militia Act of 1792 required a justice of the United States Supreme Court to certify that law enforcement was beyond the control of local authorities. On August 4, 1794, Justice James Wilson delivered his opinion that western Pennsylvania was in a state of rebellion. On August 7, Washington issued a presidential proclamation announcing, with &quot;the deepest regret&quot;, that the militia would be called out to suppress the rebellion. He commanded insurgents in western Pennsylvania to disperse by September 1.

==== Negotiations ====
In early August 1794, Washington dispatched three commissioners to the west, all of them Pennsylvanians: Attorney General William Bradford, Justice Jasper Yeates of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and Senator James Ross. Beginning on August 21, the commissioners met with a committee of westerners that included Brackenridge and Gallatin. The government commissioners told the committee that it must unanimously agree to renounce violence and submit to U.S. laws and that a popular referendum must be held to determine if the local people supported the decision. Those who agreed to these terms would be given amnesty from further prosecution.

The committee was divided between radicals and moderates, and narrowly passed a resolution agreeing to submit to the government&#x27;s terms. The popular referendum was held on September 11 and also produced mixed results. Some townships overwhelmingly supported submitting to U.S. law, but opposition to the government remained strong in areas where poor and landless people predominated. On September 24, 1794, Washington received a recommendation from the commissioners that in their judgment, &quot;(it was) ... necessary that the civil authority should be aided by a military force in order to secure a due execution of the laws...&quot; On September 25, Washington issued a proclamation summoning the New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia militias into service and warned that anyone who aided the insurgents did so at their own peril. The trend was towards submission, however, and westerners dispatched representatives William Findley and David Redick to meet with Washington and to halt the progress of the oncoming army. Washington and Hamilton declined, arguing that violence was likely to re-emerge if the army turned back.

==== Militia expedition ====
Under the authority of the recently passed federal militia law, the state militias were called up by the governors of New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. The federalized militia force of 12,950 men was a large army by American standards of the time, comparable to Washington&#x27;s armies during the Revolution. Relatively few men volunteered for militia service, so a draft was used to fill out the ranks. Draft evasion was widespread, and conscription efforts resulted in protests and riots, even in eastern areas. Three counties in eastern Virginia were the scenes of armed draft resistance. In Maryland, Governor Thomas Sim Lee sent 800 men to quash an anti-draft riot in Hagerstown; about 150 people were arrested.

Liberty poles were raised in various places as the militia was recruited, worrying federal officials. A liberty pole was raised in Carlisle, Pennsylvania on September 11, 1794. The federalized militia arrived in that town later that month and rounded up suspected pole-raisers. Two civilians were killed in these operations. On September 29, an unarmed boy was shot by an officer whose pistol accidentally fired. Two days later, an &quot;Itinerant Person&quot; was &quot;Bayoneted&quot; to death by a soldier while resisting arrest (the man had tried to wrest the rifle from the soldier he confronted; it is possible he had been a member of a 500-strong Irish work crew nearby who were &quot;digging, a canal into the Sculkill&quot; ; at least one of that work gang&#x27;s members protested the killing so vigorously that he was &quot;put under guard&quot;). President Washington ordered the arrest of the two soldiers and had them turned over to civilian authorities. A state judge determined that the deaths had been accidental, and the soldiers were released.

Washington left Philadelphia (which at that time was the capital of the United States) on September 30 to review the progress of the military expedition. According to historian Joseph Ellis, this was &quot;the first and only time a sitting American president led troops in the field&quot;.

Along the way he traveled to Reading, Pennsylvania on his way to meet up with the rest of the militia he ordered mobilized at Carlisle. On the second of October, Washington left Reading, Pennsylvania heading west to Womelsdorf in order to &quot;view the (Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company) canal...&quot;. Revolutionary war and Siege of Yorktown veteran, Colonel Jonathan Forman (1755–1809) led the Third Infantry Regiment of New Jersey troops against the Whiskey Rebellion and wrote about his encounter with Washington:

Washington met with the western representatives in Bedford, Pennsylvania on October 9 before going to Fort Cumberland in Maryland to review the southern wing of the army. He was convinced that the federalized militia would meet little resistance, and he placed the army under the command of the Virginia Governor Henry &quot;Lighthorse Harry&quot; Lee, a hero of the Revolutionary War. Washington returned to Philadelphia; Hamilton remained with the army as civilian adviser.

Daniel Morgan, the victor of the Battle of Cowpens during the American Revolution, was called up to lead a force to suppress the protest. It was at this time (1794) that Morgan was promoted to Major General. Serving under General &quot;Light-Horse Harry&quot; Lee, Morgan led one wing of the militia army into Western Pennsylvania. The massive show of force brought an end to the protests without a shot being fired. After the uprising had been suppressed, Morgan commanded the remnant of the army that remained until 1795 in Pennsylvania, some 1,200 militiamen, one of whom was Meriwether Lewis.

=== Aftermath ===
The insurrection collapsed as the federal army marched west into western Pennsylvania in October 1794. The army encountered no resistance.

Upon arriving in Western Pennsylvania, Lee prepared to arrest rebel leaders. With little regard for due process, troops carried out raids on the night of November 13, breaking into houses and rousing suspects from their beds. No distinction was made between rebels and witnesses. Captives were driven, in their nightclothes and barefoot, over muddy roads and streams, to be held in floorless animal pens and basements. Some had their health ruined, and at least one died. The night was remembered locally as &quot;the Dreadful Night&quot; for years. About 150 persons were arrested.

Immediately before the arrests &quot;...as many as 2,000 of [the rebels]...had fled into the mountains, beyond the reach of the militia. It was a great disappointment to Hamilton, who had hoped to bring rebel leaders such as David Bradford to trial in Philadelphia...and possibly see them hanged for treason. Instead, when the militia at last turned back, out of all the suspects they had seized a mere twenty were selected to serve as examples, They were at worst bit players in the uprising, but they were better than nothing.&quot;

The captured participants and the Federal militia arrived in Philadelphia on Christmas Day. Some artillery was fired and church bells were heard as &quot;... a huge throng lined Broad Street to cheer the troops and mock the rebels ... [Presley] Neville said he &#x27;could not help feeling sorry for them. The captured rebels were paraded down Broad Street being &#x27;humiliated, bedraggled, [and] half-starved ...&#x27; &quot;

Other accounts describe the indictment of 24 men for high treason. Most of the accused had eluded capture, so only ten men stood trial for treason in federal court. Of these, only Philip Wigle and John Mitchell were convicted. Wigle had beaten up a tax collector and burned his house; Mitchell was a simpleton who had been convinced by David Bradford to rob the U.S. mail. These, the only two convicted of treason and sentenced to death by hanging, were later pardoned by President Washington. Pennsylvania state courts were more successful in prosecuting lawbreakers, securing numerous convictions for assault and rioting.

In his seventh State of the Union Address, Washington explained his decision to pardon Mitchell and Wigle. Hamilton and John Jay drafted the address, as they had others, before Washington made the final edit:-

&quot;The misled have abandoned their errors,&quot; he stated. &quot;For though I shall always think it a sacred duty to exercise with firmness and energy the constitutional powers with which I am vested, yet it appears to me no less consistent with the public good than it is with my personal feelings to mingle in the operations of Government every degree of moderation and tenderness which the national justice, dignity, and safety may permit.&quot;

While violent opposition to the whiskey tax ended, opposition to the tax continued. Most distillers in nearby Kentucky were found to be all but impossible to tax—in the next six years, over 175 distillers from Kentucky were convicted of violating the tax law. Numerous examples of resistance are recorded in court documents and newspaper accounts. Opponents of internal taxes rallied around the candidacy of Thomas Jefferson and helped him defeat President John Adams in the election of 1800. By 1802, Congress repealed the distilled spirits excise tax and all other internal Federal taxes. Until the War of 1812, the Federal government would rely solely on import tariffs for revenue, which quickly grew with the Nation&#x27;s expanding foreign trade.

== Legacy ==

The Washington administration&#x27;s suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion met with widespread popular approval. The episode demonstrated that the new national government had the willingness and ability to suppress violent resistance to its laws. It was, therefore, viewed by the Washington administration as a success, a view that has generally been endorsed by historians. The Washington administration and its supporters usually failed to mention, however, that the whiskey excise remained difficult to collect, and that many westerners continued to refuse to pay the tax. The events contributed to the formation of political parties in the United States, a process already underway. The whiskey tax was repealed after Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Republican Party came to power in 1801, which opposed the Federalist Party of Hamilton and Washington.

The Rebellion raised the question of what kinds of protests were permissible under the new Constitution. Legal historian Christian G. Fritz argued that there was not yet a consensus about sovereignty in the United States, even after ratification of the Constitution. Federalists believed that the government was sovereign because it had been established by the people; radical protest actions were permissible during the American Revolution but were no longer legitimate, in their thinking. But the Whiskey Rebels and their defenders believed that the Revolution had established the people as a &quot;collective sovereign&quot;, and the people had the collective right to change or challenge the government through extra-constitutional means.

Historian Steven Boyd argued that the suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion prompted anti-Federalist westerners to finally accept the Constitution and to seek change by voting for Republicans rather than resisting the government. Federalists, for their part, came to accept the public&#x27;s role in governance and no longer challenged the freedom of assembly and the right to petition. Historian Carol Berkin argues that the episode, in the long run, strengthened US nationalism because the people appreciated how well Washington handled the rebels without resorting to tyranny.

=== In popular culture ===
Soon after the Whiskey Rebellion, actress-playwright Susanna Rowson wrote a stage musical about the insurrection entitled &quot;The Volunteers&quot;, with music by composer Alexander Reinagle. The play is now lost, but the songs survive and suggest that Rowson&#x27;s interpretation was pro-Federalist. The musical celebrates as American heroes the militiamen who put down the rebellion, the &quot;volunteers&quot; of the title. President Washington and Martha Washington attended a performance of the play in Philadelphia in January 1795.

W. C. Fields recorded a comedy track in Les Paul&#x27;s studio in 1946, shortly before his death, entitled &quot;The Temperance Lecture&quot; for the album &quot;W. C. Fields ... His Only Recording Plus 8 Songs by Mae West&quot;. The bit discussed Washington and his role in putting down the Whiskey Rebellion, and Fields wondered aloud whether &quot;George put down a little of the vile stuff too.&quot;

L. Neil Smith wrote the alternate history novel &quot;The Probability Broach&quot; in 1980 as part of his North American Confederacy Series. In it, Albert Gallatin joins the rebellion in 1794 to benefit the farmers, rather than the fledgling US government as he did in reality. This results in the rebellion becoming a Second American Revolution. This eventually leads to George Washington being overthrown and executed for treason, the abrogation of the Constitution, and Gallatin being proclaimed the second president and serving as president until 1812.

David Liss&#x27; 2008 novel &quot;The Whiskey Rebels&quot; covers many of the circumstances during 1788–92 that led to the 1794 Rebellion. The fictional protagonists are cast against an array of historical persons, including Alexander Hamilton, William Duer, Anne Bingham, Hugh Henry Brackenridge, Aaron Burr, and Philip Freneau.

In 2011, the Whiskey Rebellion Festival was started in Washington, Pennsylvania. This annual event is held in July and includes live music, food, and historic reenactments, featuring the &quot;tar and feathering&quot; of the tax collector.

A purported flag of the rebels, a blue banner with 13 white stars and an eagle holding a red and white ribbon, has become popular in Libertarian circles, and with those dissatisfied with the federal government in general. However, due to the design of the flag, having 13 stars when there were 15 states, and the lack of primary sources with an account of the flag&#x27;s use, has led historians to speculate the flag might have either never have existed, was made in 1894 for the 100th anniversary, or was used by Federal forces.

<text>Glasgow City Council (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Comhairle Baile Ghlaschu&quot;) is the local government authority for Glasgow City council area, Scotland. In its modern form it was created in 1996. Glasgow was formerly governed by a corporation, also known as the town council, from the granting of its first burgh charter in the 1170s until 1975. From 1975 until 1996 the city was governed by City of Glasgow District Council, a lower-tier authority within the Strathclyde region.

Glasgow City Council has been under no overall control since 2017, being led by a Scottish National Party minority administration. The council has its headquarters at Glasgow City Chambers in George Square, completed in 1889.

==History==
===Glasgow Corporation===
Glasgow was given its first burgh charter sometime between 1175 and 1178 by William the Lion. It was then run by &quot;Glasgow Town Council&quot;, also known as &quot;Glasgow Corporation&quot;, until 1975. The city was part of Lanarkshire until 1893, but the functions which operated at county level were relatively few, largely being limited to lieutenancy and sheriffdom. When elected county councils were created in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, Glasgow Corporation was deemed capable of running its own affairs and so the city was excluded from the area controlled by Lanarkshire County Council, although the county council nevertheless chose to meet in Glasgow as a conveniently accessible location. In 1893, Glasgow became its own county for lieutenancy and sheriffdom purposes too, being made a county of itself.

The boundaries of the burgh were extended several times to incorporate areas where the urban zone outgrew the previous boundaries or where there were plans for development. These significant expansions comprise:
*1830 - Blythswood
*1846 - Anderston, Calton, and Gorbals
*1891 - Crosshill, Govanhill, Pollokshields, Pollokshields East, Hillhead, and Maryhill
*1905 - Kinning Park
*1912 - Govan, Partick, and Pollokshaws
*1926 - Cardonald, Crookston, Lambhill, Mansewood, Millerston, Nitshill, Scotstounhill, and Yoker
*1938 - Castlemilk, Darnley, Drumchapel, and Easterhouse

===City of Glasgow District Council===
Local government across Scotland was reorganised in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which replaced the counties and burghs with a two-tier structure of upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Glasgow became a district within the Strathclyde region. The local authority was therefore renamed the &quot;City of Glasgow District Council&quot;. The Glasgow district covered a larger area than the pre-1975 city, gaining Baillieston, Cambuslang, Carmunnock, Carmyle, Garrowhill, Mount Vernon, Rutherglen, and Springboig.

===Glasgow City Council===
Local government was reorganised again in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, which abolished the regions and districts created in 1975 and established 32 single-tier council areas across Scotland, one being the city of Glasgow. The council adopted its modern name of &quot;Glasgow City Council&quot; following these reforms. The council area created in 1996 was smaller than the district which had existed between 1975 and 1996, with the Rutherglen and Cambuslang area being transferred instead to the new South Lanarkshire council area following a local referendum.

==Political control==

The first election to the City of Glasgow District Council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing corporation until the new system came into force on 16 May 1975. A shadow authority was again elected in 1995 ahead of the reforms which came into force on 1 April 1996. Political control of the council since 1975 has been as follows:

City of Glasgow District Council
Glasgow City Council
===Leadership===
&quot;For leaders before 1996 see Politics of Glasgow&quot;

The council is ceremonially headed by the Lord Provost of Glasgow, who convenes meetings of the council and performs associated tasks as a general civic leader. The role dates from the 15th century. Since 1893, when the city was made a county of itself, the Lord Provost has also acted as Lord Lieutenant of the city. The current Lord Provost, elected in May 2022 after that month&#x27;s election, is Jacqueline McLaren.

Political leadership is provided by the leader of the council. The council changed from an executive-led governance system to a committee-led system in September 2017, with the leader of the council since then chairing the City Administration Committee. The leaders since 1996 have been:

=== Composition ===
Following the 2022 election and subsequent by-elections and changes of allegiance up to January 2025, the composition of the council was:


The next election is due in 2027.

==Elections==

The council consists of 85 councillors elected for a five-year term from 23 wards. Since 2007 elections have been held every five years under the single transferable vote system, introduced by the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004 to replace the first-past-the-post system.

The most recent full council election took place on 5 May 2022, in which no party held a majority of the seats, as had also been the case in the preceding 2017 election. The Scottish National Party remained the largest party, winning 37 seats, whilst Labour won 36 seats, an increase relative to its 2017 result. The Greens won ten seats, also improving on their position in 2017, whilst the Conservatives lost all but two councillors.

The next election is due to take place on 6 May 2027. Election results since 1995 have been as follows:


==Premises==
The council has its meeting place and main offices at Glasgow City Chambers in George Square.

Glasgow Corporation was based at the Tolbooth at Glasgow Cross from at least the fifteenth century, which was rebuilt several times. The last Tolbooth on the site was built in 1626. Most of that building was demolished in 1921, leaving only the steeple standing as a clock tower.
In 1814 the corporation vacated the Tolbooth and moved to the new Justiciary Buildings on Saltmarket, overlooking Glasgow Green. The building served both as council chamber and offices for the corporation and as the courthouse for the Lower Ward of Lanarkshire. In 1844 the corporation and sheriff court moved to the new Sheriff Court on Wilson Street. The Justiciary Buildings on Saltmarket thereafter served solely as a courthouse.

In 1889 the council moved to its own purpose-built headquarters at the City Chambers in George Square.

==Wards==
The current multi-member ward system (23 wards, 85 seats) was introduced for the 2017 council election, replacing a similar model (21 wards, 79 seats) in place between 2007 and 2017:

<doc id="143548" wikidata="Q207679" url="?curid=143548" title="Perth and Kinross">
<text>Perth and Kinross (; ) is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland, and a lieutenancy area. It is bordered by Highland and Aberdeenshire to the north, Angus, Dundee, and Fife to the east, Clackmannanshire to the south, and Stirling and Argyll and Bute to the west.

Geographically the area is split by the Highland Boundary Fault into a more mountainous northern part and a flatter southern part. The northern area is a popular tourist spot, while agriculture makes an important contribution to the southern part of the area.

The area is run by Perth and Kinross Council, which is based in Perth.

==History==
The area takes its name from the two historical shires of Perthshire and Kinross-shire. Each was administered by a sheriff from medieval times, supplemented by commissioners of supply from 1667 and then by a county council from 1890.
Perthshire was one of the largest counties, whereas Kinross-shire was one of the smallest; it was the least populous Scottish county in the 1921 census. In 1930 the county councils for Perthshire and Kinross-shire were combined for most purposes. The two councils continued to be elected as separate bodies, but operated together as the &#x27;Perth and Kinross Joint County Council&#x27;, serving the combined area of the two counties.

Local government was reformed in Scotland in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. Mainland Scotland&#x27;s counties, burghs and landward districts were replaced with a two-tier structure of upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Perth and Kinross was created as one of the districts within the Tayside region. As established in 1975, Perth and Kinross covered the whole of Kinross-shire, and the majority of the pre-1975 Perthshire, with three exceptions: a large area in the south-west of the county which went to the new Stirling district, Muckhart which went to Clackmannan district, and Longforgan which went to the city of Dundee. Perth and Kinross also included the parish of Kettins from Angus. A lieutenancy area covering the same area as the new district was created at the same time.

In 1996, local government in Scotland was reformed again under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994. The regions and districts were abolished and replaced by unitary council areas. One such area was named by the 1994 Act as &#x27;Perthshire and Kinross&#x27;, covering the area of the 1975–1996 district of Perth and Kinross, plus an area transferred from Dundee roughly matching the pre-1975 parish of Longforgan. The shadow authority elected in 1995 to oversee the transition requested a change of name from &#x27;Perthshire and Kinross&#x27; to &#x27;Perth and Kinross&#x27; in December 1995, which was agreed by the government before the new council area came into force on 1 April 1996. The Perth and Kinross lieutenancy area was adjusted to match the new council area in 1996.

==Geography==

The Highland Boundary Fault runs across the region from the northeast to the southwest. This roughly divides the area between highland Perthshire, including part of the Grampian Mountains, to the north, and lowland Perthshire and Kinross to the south. The highland area is intersected with glacial valleys, often containing ribbon lakes, including Loch Tay and Loch Earn. The lowland area is a fertile region lying within the Central Lowlands.

River Tay, the longest river in Scotland, flows through the mountainous terrains of Perthshire and Kinross. Emerging from Loch Tay, it flows eastward and, after joining the River Isla, it turns south and runs through Perth, before entering the Firth of Tay.
==Economy==
In the southern part of Perth and Kinross agriculture plays an important part of the local economy. This includes the cultivation of fruits, fodder, wheat and seed potatoes.

The scenic nature of the northern part of Perth and Kinross makes tourism an important part of the economy. The Forestry Commission controls large parts of the area, which is also home to a number of hydroelectric dams.

==Politics and governance==
===Local government===
The local authority is Perth and Kinross Council, which meets at 2 High Street, Perth.

===Scottish Parliament===
Perth and Kinross is covered by two Scottish Parliament constituencies and one electoral region. Following the 2021 Scottish Parliament election these two constituencies—Perthshire South and Kinross-shire and Perthshire North—are held respectively by Jim Fairlie and John Swinney, both members of the Scottish National Party. Following the same election the electoral region—Mid Scotland and Fife—is represented by four members of the Scottish Conservatives, two members of Scottish Labour, and one member of the Scottish Greens.

===UK Parliament===
Perth and Kinross is covered by three United Kingdom Parliament constituencies; Perth and Kinross-shire, Angus and Perthshire Glens and Stirling and Strathallan. Following the 2024 UK Parliamentary General Election these seats are respectively held by Pete Wishart (Scottish National Party), Dave Doogan (Scottish National Party) and Chris Kane (Labour Party).

===Referendums===
On 18 September 2014, Perth and Kinross voted strongly &quot;No&quot; in the Scottish Independence Referendum, with a majority of 60.2% on a record turnout of 86.9%.

On 23 June 2016, Perth and Kinross voted in favour of remain in the Brexit referendum, with a majority of 61.1% on a turnout of 73.7%.

<text>Henry Baker (8 May 1698 – 25 November 1774) was a British naturalist.

==Life==
He was born in Chancery Lane, London, 8 May 1698, the son of William Baker, a clerk in chancery. When he was 15, he was apprenticed to John Parker, a bookseller. At the close of his indentures in 1720, Baker went on a visit to John Forster, a relative, who had a deaf-mute daughter, then eight years old. As a successful therapist of deaf people, he went on to make money, by a system that he kept secret. His work as therapist caught the attention of Daniel Defoe, whose youngest daughter Sophia he married on 30 April 1729.

In 1740, he was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and of the Royal Society. In 1744, he received the Copley gold medal for microscopical observations on the crystallization of saline particles.

He was one of the founders of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce in 1754 (later the Society of Arts), and for some time acted as its secretary. He died in London, and was buried at St Mary le Strand.

==&quot;Universal Spectator&quot;==
Under the name of Henry Stonecastle, Baker was associated with Daniel Defoe in starting the &quot;Universal Spectator and Weekly Journal&quot; in 1728. Defoe in fact did little except at the launch of the publication, intended as an essay-sheet rather than a newspaper. It appeared until 1746, running to 907 issues. Baker&#x27;s involvement as editor continued until 1733. Among the major early contributors was the journalist John Kelly.

==Works==
He contributed many memoirs to the &quot;Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;. Among his publications were &quot;A Short History of Speech&quot; (1723), &quot;The Microscope made Easy&quot; (1743), &quot;Employment for the Microscope&quot; (1753), where he noted down the presence of dinoflagellates for the first time as &quot;Animalcules which cause the Sparkling Light in Sea Water&quot;, and several volumes of verse, original and translated, including &quot;The Universe, a Poem intended to restrain the Pride of Man&quot; (1727).

==Legacy==
His name is perpetuated by the Bakerian Lecture of the Royal Society, for the foundation of which he left by will the sum of £100.

<doc id="143554" wikidata="Q1248938" url="?curid=143554" title="The Larry Sanders Show">
<text>The Larry Sanders Show is an American television sitcom set in the office and studio of a fictional late-night talk show. Created by Garry Shandling and Dennis Klein, the show ran for six seasons and 90 episodes on the HBO cable television network from August 15, 1992, to May 31, 1998.

The show stars Shandling, Jeffrey Tambor, and Rip Torn and features celebrities playing exaggerated, parodic versions of themselves. The show has its roots in Shandling&#x27;s stand-up comedy background, his experience as a guest host on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and his earlier sitcom, &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot;. The program has had a marked and long-lasting influence on HBO as well as on television shows in the United States and United Kingdom such as &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; (which also aired on the same network), &quot;30 Rock&quot;, and &quot;The Office&quot;. The supporting cast includes Janeane Garofalo, Wallace Langham, Penny Johnson, Linda Doucett, Scott Thompson, and Jeremy Piven.

The show received universal critical acclaim and is often regarded as an influential and landmark series. It ranked 38 on TV Guide&#x27;s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time, the only HBO comedy to make the list, and was also included in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Best TV Shows of All Time&quot;. The show won 24 major awards, including three Primetime Emmy Awards, five CableACE Awards, four American Comedy Awards, two British Comedy Awards, two Peabody Awards, a BAFTA Award and a Satellite Award. It also received 86 nominations, including 56 Primetime Emmy Awards nominations, five Directors Guild of America nominations, six Writers Guild of America nominations, six American Comedy Awards nominations, three Golden Globe nominations, three Satellite Awards nominations and a GLAAD Award nomination.

== Premise ==

=== Origins ===
From the mid-1980s to the late 1990s, a stream of American stand-up comedians found success in sitcoms on broadcast network television, including Bill Cosby, Roseanne Barr, Richard Lewis, Jerry Seinfeld, Tim Allen, Paul Reiser, Tom Arnold, Brett Butler, Ellen DeGeneres, Drew Carey, Kevin Brennan and Ray Romano. Garry Shandling took a slightly different path with the cable network sitcoms &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; and its forerunner &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot;.

In &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot;, Shandling makes use of the George Burns technique of directly addressing the audience. He speaks to the studio and home audiences as well as the other actors, often in quick succession. In both shows celebrity guests appear as themselves and Shandling essentially plays himself: a star of a television show and stand-up comedian with a distinctive &quot;comic persona and rhythm&quot;. Shandling said, in an interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;the idea for doing something about a talk show host actually came out of an &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot; episode in which I was the guest on an LA morning show ... I thought I could make the talk show look very real so the audience would buy that part and then slowly suck them into the realities of life once Larry goes behind the curtain.&quot;

In 1981, Shandling performed a stand-up routine on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and subsequently became a regular guest, particularly on short notice. He also began appearing as a guest host and, in 1986, replaced Joan Rivers as &quot;permanent guest host.&quot; He was considered to be a possible, although unlikely, successor to Johnny Carson. After Jay Leno replaced Carson in 1992, Shandling was offered his own late-night (1 a.m.) talk show but preferred instead to create &quot;a show about a talk-show&quot;, &quot;The Larry Sanders Show.&quot; The series has similarities to &quot;The Player&quot;, &quot;The King of Comedy&quot; and classic Hollywood back-stage musicals with their &quot;let&#x27;s put on a show&quot; theme, but the links to &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; are so strong it verges on parody. Alex Pareene commented &quot;Shandling turned down hosting a network late night show to do a brilliant cult hit sitcom about a version of himself who took the deal.&quot;

=== Plot ===
The show follows the production of a fictional late-night talk show &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;. It chronicles the daily life of host Larry (Garry Shandling), producer Arthur &quot;Artie&quot; (Rip Torn), sidekick Hank Kingsley (Jeffrey Tambor) and their interaction with celebrity guests, the network and others. Episodes focus on the professional and personal lives of the principal characters, with most focusing on Larry. Ancillary characters are also featured, among them the writers Phil (Wallace Langham) and Jerry (Jeremy Piven), talent bookers Paula (Janeane Garofalo) and Mary Lou (Mary Lynn Rajskub) and the personal assistants Beverly, Darlene, and Brian. Larry&#x27;s wife, ex-wife, and girlfriends are frequent sources of conflict, and his home is a secondary location for the show.

Episodes often focus on power dynamics. Supporting characters commonly struggle for status or power, both within the structure of the show&#x27;s staff as well as within the broader Hollywood community. These struggles almost always end with the character receiving their comeuppance from Larry, Artie, or one of the episode&#x27;s guest stars.

A typical early episode opens to the titles with the sound of Hank&#x27;s audience warm-up routine in the background. This is followed by the talk show&#x27;s titles and an excerpt from Larry&#x27;s monologue. Episodes vary after this, sometimes continuing with the studio recording, but often cutting to a back-stage shot or to the production offices.

=== Writing and production ===
&quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; is a satire on show business that mixes fact with fiction. It featured real-life celebrity guests as they performed on the talk show and as they appeared behind the scenes. For example, in the final episode Larry interviews Sean Penn who, once they cut to a commercial break, gossips freely about Shandling&#x27;s acting, insecurity, and behavior towards Penn&#x27;s wife (Robin Wright) on the set of &quot;Hurlyburly&quot;, in which all three appear. The scripts often shocked by appearing to show the guest&#x27;s malice, or the difference between their public and private personas.

Profanities are used on the show, although not gratuitously, with the writers taking advantage of the freedom allowed by HBO as a subscription cable service. It paved the way for subsequent HBO shows such as &quot;Oz&quot;, &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, and &quot;Deadwood&quot;. According to Peter Tolan, early episodes were also recorded with language suitable for broadcast syndication until midway through the second season, when the actors resisted shooting the extra takes.

The show used both videotape and film. The behind the scenes footage was shot on film, often using hand-held cameras, in a documentary style. Four video cameras recorded the show-within-a-show which gives a brighter, less grainy picture and helps distinguish the talk show from the back-stage scenes. The talk show was staged with realistic music, lighting and set design. It was recorded in front of an actual live studio audience during the first season and then occasionally during later episodes.

The show had a few catchphrases used throughout its entire run. The most common was &quot;Hey now,&quot; a phrase Hank repeats in the opening credits of the fictional talk show and whenever he greets someone (though it was intellectual property of the network; season 3, episode 1, &quot;Montana&quot;). It mirrors the &quot;Hi-yo&quot; catchphrase used by Ed McMahon (sidekick on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;), upon whom Hank Kingsley was based. In season 1 episode 10, &quot;The Party&quot;, Hank says: &quot;No, no, no. You see, when I was a kid, I used to say &#x27;hey,&#x27; and then later I said &#x27;now,&#x27; but I never put them together until much later.&quot; In 2007, Nickelodeon&#x27;s TV Land ranked &quot;Hey Now&quot; as the 87th Best Television catchphrase. &quot;No flipping&quot; is a phrase Larry uses to go to commercial breaks, encouraging the viewer audience not to change to another channel (which was considered public domain; season 3, episode 1, &quot;Montana&quot;). At the end of the season 2, (episode 17, &quot;New York or LA&quot;): Larry says: &quot;You may feel free to flip&quot; upon deciding at the end of a talk show scene to retire and relocate to Montana. During the series finale, the last thing Larry says on his talk show is, &quot;You may now flip.&quot;

== Episodes ==

=== Season 1 ===
The first season premiered on August 15, 1992, and ended on November 7, 1992, and was an immediate success. Story arcs include the breakdown of Larry&#x27;s relationship with his second wife Jeannie (Megan Gallagher) and his abuse of Excedrin tablets.

=== Season 2 ===
The second season premiered on June 2, 1993, and ended on September 29, 1993. The story arcs include Larry beginning a new relationship with his ex-wife Francine (Kathryn Harrold) and Hank investing all his money in a street-level revolving restaurant.

Jeremy Piven grew tired of playing the character Jerry, head writer of the fictional talk show, because his character was not given much of a background. He was written out during the episode &quot;Larry&#x27;s Birthday&quot;, where Artie fired Jerry because of his behavior. Eventually, Wallace Langham (Phil) replaced him as the talk show&#x27;s head writer.
Some popular episodes of the season were: &quot;Larry&#x27;s Agent&quot;, in which Larry tries to fire his agent; &quot;Broadcast Nudes&quot;, in which Hank wants Darlene (Linda Doucett) to pose nude in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine (Doucett actually appeared in the September 1993 edition of the magazine); &quot;Larry&#x27;s Birthday&quot; in which Larry doesn&#x27;t want anyone throwing a party for his birthday; &quot;The Grand Opening&quot;, in which Hank tries to promote his new restaurant; &quot;Off Camera&quot;, in which Larry has to deal with all the stress that Artie suffers every show and the season finale &quot;L.A. or N.Y?&quot;, in which Larry leaves the talk show and moves to Montana, to protest the network&#x27;s desire to shift the talk show&#x27;s base from L.A. to New York.

=== Season 3 ===
The season premiered on July 22, 1994, and ended on October 12, 1994. Some of the most popular episodes of the season were: &quot;Montana&quot;, in which the talk show gets back on the air after Larry discovers that life in Montana is not to his liking; &quot;You&#x27;re Having My Baby&quot;, in which a woman claims that she is having Larry&#x27;s baby; &quot;Hank&#x27;s Night in the Sun&quot;, in which Hank fulfills his dream of becoming guest host; &quot;The Mr. Sharon Stone Show&quot;, which Larry dates Sharon Stone and finds out what it means to be the less famous member of a show business couple; and the season finale &quot;End of the Season&quot; in which Larry gets engaged to Roseanne Barr.

=== Season 4 ===
The season premiered on July 19, 1995, and ended on November 22, 1995. Linda Doucett (Darlene) left the show at the end of season three. She had been in a six-year relationship with Shandling, but the couple became estranged between seasons and she was written out of the show. Doucett filed a lawsuit against Shandling and producer Brad Grey&#x27;s company for sexual harassment and wrongful termination, which was settled out of court for $1 million. She was replaced as Hank&#x27;s assistant by Scott Thompson (Brian). Some of the most popular episodes of the season included: &quot;Roseanne&#x27;s Return&quot;, in which Larry has to face Roseanne Barr after their engagement broke off; &quot;Arthur After Hours&quot;, in which it is revealed what Artie does after an unsuccessful broadcast; &quot;Jeannie&#x27;s Visit&quot;, in which Larry&#x27;s ex-wife visits the talk show; &quot;Hank&#x27;s Sex Tape&quot;, in which Hank becomes incensed when Phil circulates a tape of him having sex with two women; and the season finale &quot;Larry&#x27;s On Vacation&quot;, in which Sandra Bernhard tries to take over the talk show.

=== Season 5 ===
The season premiered November 13, 1996, and ended on February 26, 1997. Janeane Garofalo decided to leave due to decreasing screen time for her character Paula, the talk show&#x27;s talent booker. Mary Lynn Rajskub (Mary Lou, Paula&#x27;s assistant) replaced her as booker. Jon Stewart became a frequent guest who threatened to replace Larry on the talk show. Some of the most famous episodes of the series were made in this season: &quot;Everybody Loves Larry&quot;, in which Larry starts suspecting that David Duchovny has sexual feelings for him; &quot;My Name is Asher Kingsley&quot;, in which Hank explores his Jewish roots; &quot;Ellen, or Isn&#x27;t She?&quot;, in which Larry and Artie try to find out if Ellen DeGeneres is really a lesbian; &quot;The New Writer&quot;, in which Wendy (Sarah Silverman) begins working as a writer, much to Phil&#x27;s dismay; &quot;The Book&quot;, in which Larry writes an autobiography; &quot;Pain Equals Funny&quot;, in which Paula leaves the show; and the season finale, &quot;Larry&#x27;s New Love&quot;, in which Hank is afraid the network is trying to replace him.

=== Season 6 ===
The season premiered on March 15, 1998, and ended on May 31, 1998. Shandling decided to make this the final season in part because of his high workload on the show. The main story arc is the increasing pressure from the network to aim for a younger audience that results in Larry deciding to leave the talk show.

Most of the changes to the show occurred offscreen this season. All of the show&#x27;s writers left except Shandling, Tolan, and Apatow, and a new writing staff was hired. Shandling&#x27;s relationship with his manager, Brad Grey, had broken down and in January 1998, Shandling filed a lawsuit for $100 million against Grey. In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Shandling said &quot;We had a situation in which the writers were leaving the show for other Brillstein-Grey shows, which became part of the issue of a lawsuit&quot;. (The suit was settled out of court for $10 million.) Todd Holland, who directed more than 48 episodes of the show, only directed two of the sixth season. This season was also markedly less comedic than earlier ones. Sid, the cue card guy at the talk show, commits suicide in the episode &quot;I Buried Sid&quot;.

Some of the most popular episodes of the season were: &quot;Another List&quot;, in which the network threatens to replace Larry with Jon Stewart unless he makes some changes; &quot;The Beginning of the End&quot;, in which the talk show gets a new creative consultant who wants to make big changes; &quot;Adolf Hankler&quot;, in which Hank has to play Adolf Hitler, while Larry is on vacation and Jon Stewart guest hosts; &quot;Beverly&#x27;s Secret&quot;, in which Beverly (Penny Johnson) tries to tell the father that she&#x27;s pregnant; &quot;Putting the &#x27;Gay&#x27; Back in Litigation&quot;, in which Brian sues Phil and the talk show for sexual harassment; and the series finale &quot;Flip&quot;, in which the cast gets ready for their final broadcast and Larry and Artie deal with Hank and the emotions of the crew.

The finale was written by Shandling and Tolan. It was directed by Holland with a running time of 53 minutes. It aired on May 31, 16 days after the finale of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, and was watched by 2.5 million viewers, which was a significant number for HBO. The finale got very positive reviews from critics, especially in comparison to &quot;Seinfeld&quot;&#x27;s series finale. Coincidentally, Jerry Seinfeld appears as himself in the &quot;Larry Sanders&quot; finale. Other guests in the finale included Warren Beatty, Jim Carrey and Sean Penn.

In a commentary on the season one DVD, Shandling says the guests were invariably happy to parody their media images and generally shared the same sense of humor as himself and the other writers.

== Crew ==

=== Directors ===
The show had a total of thirteen directors. Ken Kwapis directed most of the first season, including the pilot, and contributed to the visual style of the show. (He later went on to direct episodes of &quot;The Office&quot;, also including the pilot, using a &quot;mockumentary&quot; approach.) Todd Holland directed 51 episodes spanning all six seasons. Shandling directed three episodes of the final season. Acting coach Roy London directed two episodes and received a &quot;Special Thanks&quot; credit at the end of every episode for his influence on the show. The show received one Emmy Award for directing. It went to Holland for the series finale &quot;Flip&quot;.

=== Writers ===
More than 40 writers wrote episodes of the show. Shandling and Tolan were the head writers for the entire six-season run. Shandling and Dennis Klein wrote the pilot episode of the show. Shandling wrote 38, while Tolan wrote 23 episodes. Shandling and Tolan received an Emmy Award for writing the series finale &quot;Flip&quot;. Other writers on the show were Maya Forbes, Paul Simms, Judd Apatow, John Markus, John Riggi, Jon Vitti, Chris Thompson, Drake Sather, Molly Newman, Lester Lewis, Steven Levitan, Becky Hartman Edwards and Jeff Cesario.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reaction ===
After the show ended, the &quot;New York Post&quot; called it &quot;one of the greatest achievements in television.&quot; &quot;LA Weekly&quot; deemed it &quot;very funny.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; said it was &quot;the closest sitcom ever came to perfect pitch.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the show &quot;brutally and blatantly hilarious&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot; gave it four stars.

Many critics called it one of the greatest television shows of all time. Metacritic, which uses an weighted average, gives the show a score of 95 out of 100 based on 69 critic reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Doug Elfman from the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; said &quot;It is simply one of the best sitcoms ever.&quot; Ivan Morales calls it &quot;the greatest HBO sitcom of all time.&quot; Brooke Allen in the &quot;New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a comedy series so funny and risque as to make &quot;Seinfeld&quot; look positively bland&quot;. Mark Monahan in &quot;The Telegraph&quot; called it &quot;very close indeed to comic perfection.&quot;

=== Influence ===
Despite drawing small audiences, &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; has been influential. It helped establish HBO&#x27;s reputation for quality shows, leading to &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, &quot;The Wire&quot; and &quot;Deadwood&quot;. The show influenced subsequent series with satirical backstage show business and celebrity culture themes, such as &quot;30 Rock&quot;, &quot;Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List&quot;, &quot;The Showbiz Show with David Spade&quot;, &quot;Extras&quot;, &quot;Action&quot;, and &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;.

The show&#x27;s most significant innovation is in celebrities playing themselves. It was followed in its use of celebrity guests, its lack of laugh track, and its comedy of embarrassment by &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, &quot;The Office&quot; and &quot;Arrested Development&quot;. Shandling&#x27;s performance is a precursor to Larry David&#x27;s in &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; and Ricky Gervais (&quot;The Office&quot;, &quot;Extras&quot;) as David Brent. Gervais said in &quot;Variety&quot; that he was heavily influenced by the show and that &quot;It taught me that flawed characters can be compulsive viewing – seeing them squirm and get their comeuppance.&quot; Armando Iannucci said that his political satire &quot;The Thick of It&quot; strove to mix comedy and authenticity in a similar manner to &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;.

Matt Zoller Seitz wrote in &quot;Time Out Los Angeles&quot; that it introduced to television the cinematic technique of &quot;walk and talk&quot; where the camera follows the actors as they move around the offices in conversation. This later became an important part of the style of &quot;The West Wing&quot; and &quot;ER&quot;. The show can also be seen as a distorted example of reality television because the portrayal of the talk show production is so convincing. According to Andrew Pulver in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;This is where it all began. The whole postmodernist, self-reflexive fact-fiction sitcom thing.&quot;

<text>The Finnish sauna (, ) is a substantial part of Finnish and Estonian culture.

It was inscribed on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists at the 17 December 2020 meeting of the UNESCO Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage. As authorized by the state, the Finnish Heritage Agency commits, together with Finnish sauna communities and promoters of the sauna culture, to safeguard the vitality of the sauna tradition and to highlight its importance as part of customs and wellbeing. In the case of Estonia UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists smoke sauna tradition since 2014.

The word &quot;sauna&quot; itself is of Finnish origin. In the Estonian language it is .

== History ==
The sauna in Finland is an old phenomenon and its roots are difficult to trace, but its earliest versions are believed to be from 7000 BC. Bath houses were recorded in Europe during the same time period, but Finnish bathing habits were poorly documented for most of history.

During the Reformation in Scandinavia the popularity of saunas expanded to other countries because the European bath houses were being destroyed due to syphilis among other things being endemic.

One reason the sauna culture has always flourished in Finland has been because of the versatility of the sauna. When people were moving, the first thing they did was to build a sauna. Finns have used the sauna to live in, eat, address matters of hygiene, and, most importantly, give birth in an almost sterile environment. Unlike many other, more densely populated places in Europe, the availability of wood needed to build and warm the sauna has never been an issue. Another reason for its popularity is that in such a cold climate, the sauna allows people warmth for at least a short period of time. However, it is just as popular in the summer as in the winter.

== Customs ==

Saunas are an integral part of the way of life in Finland. They are found on the shores of Finland&#x27;s numerous lakes, in private apartments, corporate headquarters, at the Parliament House and even at the depth of in Pyhäsalmi Mine. The sauna is an important part of the national identity and those who have the opportunity usually take a sauna at least once a week. The traditional sauna day is Saturday.

The sauna tradition is so strong that whenever Finns go abroad, they relish the chance to have a good sauna: even the Finnish Church in Rotherhithe, London, has its own sauna. Finnish soldiers on peacekeeping missions are famous for their saunas; even on the UNMEE mission in Eritrea, a sauna was one of the first buildings to be erected. A Second World War-era Finnish military field manual states that a break of eight hours is all that is required for a battalion to build saunas, warm them and bathe in them. Saunas, even in the military, are strictly egalitarian places: no titles or hierarchies are used in the sauna.

Taking a sauna begins with having a wash (usually a shower), followed by a sit in the sauna room, the room being typically warmed to . Water is thrown on the hot stones topping the , a special stove used to warm up the sauna. This produces great amounts of steam, known as , increasing the moisture and the apparent temperature within the sauna. Only the word is used for this particular type of steam; the Finnish word (&#x27;steam, vapour&#x27;) is never used for it except in a scientific sense. Equivalents for can be found in the Finnic languages such as the Karelian , the Estonian , the Votic &quot;leülü&quot;, the Veps &quot;l&#x27;öl&quot;&#x27; and the Livonian &quot;löul&quot;. Its original sense signified &#x27;spirit, breath, soul&#x27; and this is still seen in the Uralic languages--for example, the Udmurt &quot;lul&quot;, the Komi &quot;lol&quot;, the Mansi &quot;läl&quot; (&#x27;life&#x27;), the Khanty &quot;lil&quot; and the Hungarian .
Occasionally one uses a bunch of leafy, fragrant silver birch called a ( in Western Finland) to gently beat oneself. This supposedly has a relaxing effect on the muscles and also helps to soothe the irritation from mosquito bites. When the heat begins to feel uncomfortable it is customary to jump into a lake, sea, or a swimming pool, or to have a shower. In the winter, rolling in the snow or even swimming in a hole cut in lake ice, an , is sometimes used as a substitute. Often after the sauna it is a custom to sit down in the dressing room or on the porch of the sauna to enjoy a sausage, along with beer or soft drinks.

After cooling down from the first bath, one goes back into the hot room and begins the cycle again. The number and duration of hot room-cooling down cycles varies from person to person based on personal preference. Usually one takes at least two or three cycles, lasting between 30 minutes to two hours. In Finland&#x27;s numerous summer cottages bathing might go on well into the night. This is especially true in the summer when there&#x27;s virtually no darkness at night. The sauna session itself is finished off with a thorough wash.

For someone brought up in Finland, the rules are instinctive but they are difficult to put into words. Depending on the size, composition, relationships, and the age structure of the group three basic patterns can emerge: Everyone can go to the sauna at the same time, men and women may take a sauna separately, or each family can go to sauna separately. Mixed saunas with non-family members are most common with younger adults, and are quite rare for older people or on more formal occasions. It is common for teenagers to stop going to sauna with their parents at some point. 

In the sauna it is a to wear clothing in the hot room, although it is acceptable to sit on a small towel or , a disposable tissue designed to endure heat and humidity (it can be mandatory in a public sauna, such as at a public swimming pool). While cooling off it is common to wrap a towel around the body. For a typical Finn the sauna is, with few exceptions, a strictly non-sexual place; nudity in the sauna is a very normal state of affairs among Finns without any connection with sexual intercourse. In Finland, a &quot;sauna&quot; means only a sauna, not a brothel, sex club, or such. In public saunas, swimsuits are banned from the hot room for health reasons: in many indoor swimming pools, chlorine is added to the water for hygiene reasons; if swimwear used in such water is brought to the hot room, the chlorine will vaporize and cause breathing problems for people with asthma or allergies.

In private homes or summer residences, the sauna is usually warmed to honor the guest and refusal may be more difficult. However, Finns will not typically be very offended if their guest declines. This is particularly common if going to sauna would require a lot of effort from the guest (such as re-applying complex make-up afterwards), socially inconvenient (feeling uncomfortable about nudity or a mixed-sex sauna), or otherwise inconvenient (should the guest not have a change of clothes or if the sauna would take place late at night, et cetera).

== Types ==
Many different types of sauna can be found in Finland and Estonia. They can be classified either by the sauna building itself or by what kind of stove it uses.

The main division of saunas is between once warmed and continuously warmed stoves. All smoke saunas are once warmed, but there are also other type of ovens that are once warmed.

Once warmed stoves have larger amount of stones that are warmed up before the bathing. This can be done by burning wood, with or without a chimney, oil, wood pellets, or natural gas. Continuously warmed stoves have lower amount of stones that are heated during the bathing. The warming can be done burning wood, oil or natural gas, or electrically.

The temperature in Finnish saunas is , usually , and is kept clearly above the dewpoint despite the vaporization of water, so that visible condensation of steam does not occur as in a Turkish sauna.

=== Smoke sauna ===

The (smoke sauna) does not have a chimney and thus as wood is burned smoke fills the room. After the sauna reaches the appropriate temperature, the fire is extinguished and the room is ventilated. Given the construction of the room, the sauna retains sufficient heat for the duration of use. Although smoke saunas are considered a more traditional type, there has been a significant increase in construction in recent years. However, due to the amount of effort and time required to operate them – heating can take most of a day – they are not likely to replace most regular saunas.

Smoke saunas are still extant not only in Finland but also in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. They are considered to be cheap, simple to build, and durable (if measures of fire prevention are taken while building the sauna). The longevity is warranted by disinfectant features of smoke.

One specific and rarely seen curiosity is use of a wood pellet burner to heat a smoke sauna stove (), typically the actual burner installed into a room adjacent to the actual sauna room and the . A wood pellet burner, quite similar to an oil burner, is then used to heat a smoke sauna stove - practically a big pile of rocks. As the burning process is much cleaner than with a conventional smoke stove the smoke aroma is much less pungent and sooty, while the moisture produced by burning the pellets makes the air more pleasant than with continuously warmed stoves.

=== Wood stove sauna ===

The wood stove sauna is more common in rural areas, whereas the electric sauna is more common in urban areas. The metal stove with stones on top () is heated with birch wood fire, and this heats the sauna room to the required temperature. If birch wood is not available any other wood will do, but well dried birch wood is preferred because of its good quality and smell, and long lasting burn. The important thing is to have a good , that is when the stones are hot enough to evaporate the water thrown on them into steam that rises to the bathers. The bather in every type of sauna sits on a high bench near the ceiling where the hot steam reaches them quickly.

=== Electric sauna ===

In city apartments, and in most public saunas, an electric sauna stove () is used, as it does not require open fire and offers additional features like time delay settings, thermostat and temperature limiter. Electric saunas usually do have stones piled over or around the heating element to allow thrown onto them; either as an open, air circulating set-up or as a closed and insulated heat-storing one. Electric saunas often allow the property manager to control the sauna independently from occupants and can limit the sauna&#x27;s electricity use. The controls can be wireless and can offer additional settings for sauna lighting, ventilation and steam generating devices. An apartment buildings&#x27; sauna is typically offered a few times a week to occupants with dedicated hours for communal men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sauna, and special hours for those who have requested apartment specific hours. People might prefer the more atmospheric wood stove sauna over an electric sauna, but for those living in urban apartment blocks that is rarely an option, and electric stoves are easier to use, more fire-safe, and do not produce wood litter. Optimal bathing conditions in electric saunas can be however reached with an aid of correctly positioned ventilation.

=== Mobile saunas ===
Scouts and various other youth organizations often have portable tent saunas. Saunas have been built into cars, buses, car trailers, tractor trailers or even bicycles and boats. In Finland, there are companies that rent mobile saunas, and an annual mobile sauna event in Teuva.

<text>The 1952 Winter Olympics, officially known as the VI Olympic Winter Games (; ) and commonly known as Oslo 1952, were a winter multi-sport event held from 14 to 25 February 1952 in Oslo, the capital of Norway.

Discussions about Oslo hosting the Winter Olympic Games began as early as 1935; the city was keen to host the 1948 Winter Olympics, but that was made impossible by World War II. Instead, Oslo won the right to host the 1952 Games in a contest that included Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo in Italy and Lake Placid in the United States. All of the Olympic venues were in Oslo&#x27;s metropolitan area, except for the alpine skiing events, which were held at Norefjell, from the capital. A new hotel was built for the press and dignitaries, along with three dormitories to house athletes and coaches, creating the first modern athlete&#x27;s village. Oslo bore the financial burden of hosting the Games in return for the revenue they generated. The 1952 Winter Olympics was the first of the two consecutive Olympics to be held in Northern Europe, preceding the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland.

The 1952 Winter Games attracted 694 athletes representing 30 countries, who participated in four sports and 22 events. Japan and Germany made their returns to Winter Olympic competition after being forced to miss the 1948 Games in the aftermath of World War II. Germany was represented solely by West German athletes after East Germany declined to compete as a unified team. Portugal and New Zealand made their Winter Olympic debuts, and women were allowed to compete in cross-country skiing for the first time.

Norwegian truck driver Hjalmar Andersen won three out of four speed skating events to become the most decorated athlete of the 1952 Winter Olympics. Germany resumed its former prominence in bobsleigh, with wins in the four- and two-man events. Dick Button of the United States performed the first triple jump in international competition to claim his second consecutive men&#x27;s figure skating Olympic title. The popular Nordic sport bandy featured as a demonstration sport, but only three Nordic countries competed in the tournament. Norway dominated the overall medal count with 16 medals, including seven golds. The Games closed with the presentation of a flag that would be passed to the host city of the next Winter Olympics. The flag, which became known as the &quot;Oslo flag&quot;, has been displayed in the host city during subsequent Winter Games.

==Host city selection==

Oslo had unsuccessfully bid to host the 1936 Winter Olympics, losing to Germany, which had hosted the 1936 Summer Olympics. At that time, the nation that hosted the Summer Olympics also hosted the Winter Olympics. After the 1936 Games, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to award the Winter and Summer Games to different countries, but the Games were suspended during World War II. London hosted the first post-war Games, the 1948 Summer Olympics, and recommended Oslo as the host city for the 1948 Winter Games, but the city council declined. Instead, the 1948 Winter Olympics were held in St. Moritz, Switzerland.

Norwegians were undecided about hosting a Winter Olympics. Culturally, they were opposed to competitive winter sports, particularly skiing events, despite the success of Norwegian athletes at previous Winter Games. But the organizers believed the 1952 Games could be an opportunity to promote national unity and to show the world that Norway had recovered from the war. Vying with Oslo for the right to host the Games were Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, Italy, and Lake Placid, New York, United States. The IOC voted to award the 1952 Winter Games to Oslo on 21 June 1947 at the 40th IOC Session in Stockholm, Sweden. Later, Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo was awarded the 1956 Games, and Lake Placid—which had hosted the 1932 Winter Olympics—was chosen to host the 1980 Winter Games. Norway became the first Scandinavian country to host a Winter Olympics, and the 1952 Winter Games were the first to be held in a nation&#x27;s capital.

===Results===
==Organization==
A special committee was assigned to organize the 1952 Games, which consisted of four Norwegian sports officials and four representatives from the municipality of Oslo, including mayor Brynjulf Bull. The committee was in place by December 1947. The city of Oslo funded the Games entirely, in exchange for keeping all the revenue generated. To accommodate the influx of athletes and coaches, quarters for competitors and support staff were designed and constructed, with three new facilities (forerunners of the athlete&#x27;s villages of later Games) built. The city of Oslo paid to have a new hotel constructed, the Viking, used for IOC delegates, out-of-town dignitaries, and as the communication hub of the Games. For the first time in a Winter Games, an indoor ice hockey arena was constructed, which hosted the eight-team tournament. Oslo&#x27;s existing central arena, Bislett Stadium, was used for the opening and closing ceremonies, and for speed skating events. Improvements to the arena included better sound and lighting systems, remodeled club house and press rooms, and the addition of a medical center.

==Politics==
In the aftermath of the German occupation of Norway during World War II, anti-German sentiment began to affect preparations for the 1952 Olympics. Discussions were held to consider whether Germany should be allowed to participate in the Games. When in 1950, the West German Olympic Committee requested recognition by the IOC, it raised the question of whether their participation would cause political boycotts in the upcoming Games. Once the IOC recognized the West German Olympic Committee, West Germany was then formally invited to compete at the 1952 Winter Games. East Germany was invited to participate with West Germany, as a unified team, but they declined.

At first Norway was reluctant to welcome German athletes and others considered Nazi sympathizers. For example, Norwegian speed skater Finn Hodt was not allowed to compete in the Norwegian speed skating team because he collaborated with the Nazis during the war. Eventually, despite the concern, Norway agreed to allow German and Japanese athletes to compete. The Soviet Union sent no athletes to Oslo, despite being recognized by the IOC, sending observers instead.

==Events==
Medals were awarded in 22 events contested in four sports (eight disciplines).

===Opening ceremonies===
The opening ceremonies were held in Bislett Stadium on 15 February. King George VI of Great Britain had died on 6 February 1952 with his daughter Elizabeth II taking the throne as Queen, eight days before the start of the Games. As a result, all national flags were flown at half-mast, and Princess Ragnhild opened the Games in place of her grandfather, King Haakon VII, who was in London attending the state funeral. This was the first time an Olympic Games had been declared open by a female official. The parade of nations was held according to tradition, with Greece first and the rest of the nations proceeding by alphabetical order in the Norwegian language, with the host nation last. The British, Australian, Canadian and New Zealand teams all wore black arm bands at the opening ceremonies in memory of their monarch. Following the parade of nations, the Olympic flame was lit. On 13 February, at the start of the inaugural Winter Olympics torch relay, the torch was lit in the hearth of the Morgedal House, birthplace of skiing pioneer Sondre Norheim. The torch relay lasted two days and was conducted entirely on skis. At the opening ceremonies the final torch bearer, Eigil Nansen, received the Olympic torch and skied to a flight of stairs where he removed his skis, ascended, and ignited the flame.

The bobsleigh and alpine skiing events were held the day before the opening ceremonies. Competitors in these events were unable to attend the festivities in Oslo; consequently simple opening ceremonies were held at Frognerseteren, site of the bobsleigh events, and Norefjell, site of the alpine skiing events.

===Bobsleigh===
After a 16-year hiatus from the Olympics, Germany made a triumphant return to the bobsleigh competition, winning the two- and four-man events. The results for both bobsleigh events were the same, with the United States and Switzerland taking silver and bronze respectively. Fritz Feierabend from Switzerland competed in both the two- and four-man competitions. His two bronze medals were the fourth and fifth in an Olympic career that spanned 16 years and three Olympics. There were no weight restrictions on the bobsleigh athletes, and the average weight for each member of the winning German four-man team was , which was more than the Olympic heavyweight boxing champion in 1952. Seeing the undue advantage overweight athletes brought to their teams, the International Federation for Bobsleigh and Toboganning instituted a weight limit for future Olympics.

===Speed skating===
All of the speed skating events were held at Bislett Stadium. Americans Ken Henry and Don McDermott placed first and second in the 500-meter race, but Norwegian truck driver Hjalmar Andersen electrified the partisan crowd by winning the 1,500, 5,000 and 10,000-meter events; his margins of victory were the largest in Olympic history. Dutchman Wim van der Voort placed second in the 1,500 meters and his countryman Kees Broekman placed second to Andersen in the 5,000 and 10,000-meter races, becoming the first Olympic speed skating medalists from the Netherlands. Absent from the competition was former world champion Kornél Pajor. The Hungarian-born speed skater had won both long-distance races at the World Championships held in Oslo in 1949 and then defected to Sweden, but was unable to obtain Swedish citizenship in time to compete in 1952.

===Alpine skiing===

There were three alpine skiing events on the Olympic program: the slalom, giant slalom and downhill. Both men and women competed in all three events, held at Norefjell and Rødkleiva. The giant slalom made its Olympic debut at the 1952 Games. Austrian skiers dominated the competition, winning seven out of a possible 18 medals, including Othmar Schneider who won gold and silver in the men&#x27;s slalom and downhill. Norwegian Stein Eriksen won gold in the men&#x27;s giant slalom and silver in the slalom. Greek slalom skier Antoin Miliordos fell 18 times on his run and crossed the finish line backwards. American skier Andrea Mead Lawrence was the only double gold medalist, winning the giant slalom and the slalom. She was the first skier from the United States to win two alpine skiing gold medals.

===Cross-country skiing===

All the cross-country events were held next to the ski jump hill at Holmenkollbakken. As had been the case in 1948 there were three men&#x27;s events: 18 kilometers, 50 kilometers, and a relay. Added to the Olympic program for the first time was a ten-kilometer race for women. All the cross-country medals were won by Nordic countries, and Finnish skiers won eight of the twelve possible. Lydia Wideman of Finland became the first female Olympic champion in cross-country skiing; her teammates Mirja Hietamies and Siiri Rantanen won silver and bronze respectively. Veikko Hakulinen won the 50-kilometer men&#x27;s race to begin an Olympic career that would culminate in seven medals, three of them gold. Hallgeir Brenden won the 18-kilometer race and helped Norway take the silver in the 4 × 10-kilometer relay. Brenden went on to win another gold in the men&#x27;s 15-kilometer race in 1956, and a silver in the relay in 1960.

===Nordic combined===
The nordic combined event was held at the cross-country and ski jump venues. For the first time, the ski jump part took place first with competitors taking three jumps from the Holmenkollbakken. The 18-km cross country skiing event took place the next day. Results were tallied by the best two marks were scored, along with the results of the cross-country race, to determine a winner. Norwegians Simon Slåttvik and Sverre Stenersen won the gold and bronze respectively. Stenersen went on to win the gold at the 1956 Games in the same event. Heikki Hasu from Finland won the silver, preventing a Norwegian sweep of the medals.

===Ski jumping===
Crowds in excess of 100,000 greeted the ski jumpers as they competed at Holmenkollbakken. In 1952 there was only one event, the men&#x27;s normal hill, which was held on 24 February. The King, Prince Harald, and Princess Ragnhild were in attendance. The Norwegian athletes did not disappoint the crowd, as Arnfinn Bergmann and Torbjørn Falkanger placed first and second; Swedish jumper Karl Holmström took the bronze. Norwegian athletes won the ski jumping gold medal in every Winter Olympics from 1924 to 1952.

===Figure skating===
There were three events in the Olympic figure skating competition: men&#x27;s singles, women&#x27;s singles and mixed pairs. The events were held at Bislett Stadium on a rink constructed inside the speed skating track.

Dick Button of the United States won the men&#x27;s singles event. Helmut Seibt of Austria took silver and James Grogan of the United States won bronze. Button became the first figure-skater to land a triple jump in competition when he performed the triple loop in the men&#x27;s free skate. British skater Jeannette Altwegg won the gold medal in the women&#x27;s singles, the silver was won by American Tenley Albright, who went on to win gold at the 1956 Winter Games in Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, and Jacqueline du Bief of France won the bronze. The German husband and wife pair of Ria and Paul Falk won the mixed pairs competition. They defeated Americans Karol and Peter Kennedy, who placed second, and Hungarian siblings Marianna and László Nagy, who won the bronze medal.

===Ice hockey===
A majority of the ice hockey matches took place at Jordal Amfi, a new hockey stadium built for the Olympics. Nine teams played in the tournament and Canada again won the gold medal. Canada had won all but one Olympic hockey tournament thus far, but in 1956 the Soviet team began to compete and ended Canadian dominance. Canada was represented by the Edmonton Mercurys, an amateur hockey team sponsored by the owner of a Mercury automobile dealership. Canada played the United States to a three all tie on the final day to clinch the gold, and the Americans won silver. The official report of the USOC for the 1952 Olympics covers the game in great detail. According to the report, by the end of the game against Canada, the Americans were mentally and physically exhausted and after scoring the third goal and tying the game they decided to focus on defense in order not to lose silver. It is important to note that Canadians at the time were considered unbeatable and even tying that team was almost impossible. Sweden and Czechoslovakia ended up tied for third (Czechoslovakia defeated the Swedes in the head-to-head game, but according to the rules at the time they had to play a tiebreaker game because they were tied in points). Sweden won that game and avenged the loss in the round-robin. The Czechs believed they had already won the bronze when they defeated the Swedes in the round-robin, calling the decision to play a tie-breaking game a &quot;plot of the capitalist countries&quot;. Canadian team was criticized for its rough play; although body checking was legal, it was not often used by European teams, and opponents and spectators alike took a dim view of that style of play.

===Bandy===
The IOC lobbied the organizing committee to host either military patrol or curling as a demonstration sport. The committee instead selected bandy, which had never been included in the Winter Games. Popular in Nordic countries, bandy is played by teams of eleven on an outdoor soccer field-sized ice rink, using a small ball and sticks about long. As it was a demonstration sport, the players were ineligible for medals. Three nations participated: Finland, Norway and Sweden. Each of the three teams won one game and lost one game; with Sweden winning the competition based on number of goals scored, followed by Norway in second place, and Finland in third place. Two of the games were played at Dæhlenenga Stadium and one at Bislett Stadium.

===Closing ceremonies===

At the 1952 Winter Games, the closing ceremonies were a distinct program listing, unlike previous Winter Games when the closing ceremonies were held directly after the final event. The closing ceremonies were held in Bislett Stadium, on Monday evening, 25 February. The flag bearers entered the stadium in the same order they followed for the opening ceremonies. That evening four medal ceremonies were also held for the women&#x27;s cross-country race, the men&#x27;s cross-country relay, the ski jumping competition, and the ice hockey tournament.

Since 1920, the &quot;Antwerp flag&quot; has been passed from host city to host city during closing ceremonies for the Summer Games. The city of Oslo gave an Olympic flag to establish the same tradition for the Winter Games. Brynjulf Bull, Oslo&#x27;s mayor, passed the flag to the president of the IOC, Sigfrid Edström, who declared the flag was to pass from host city to host city for future Winter Games. The flag, which came to be known as the &quot;Oslo Flag&quot;, has since been preserved in a display case, with the name of every Winter Olympics host city engraved on brass plaques, and is brought to each Winter Games to be displayed. A replica is used during the closing ceremonies.

After the flag ceremony the Olympic flame was extinguished, a special speed skating race was held, and the figure skating competitors gave an exhibition, followed by 40 children dressed in national costumes performing an ice dance. For a finale, to the close the Games, the lights were extinguished and a 20-minute fireworks display lit up the night sky.

==Venues==

With a seating capacity of 29,000, Bislett Stadium became the centrepiece of the Games. It was the venue for the speed skating events and the figure skating competition. Bislett was large enough for a speed skating track, and a figure skating ice-rink of ; a snow bank separated the track and the rink. Because Bislett was an outdoor arena, the organizing committee chose Tryvann Stadion and Hamar Stadion as secondary alternative skating venues to be used the case of bad weather. In 1994 Hamar became the venue for the speed skating events at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer.

The Oslo Winter Games were the first to feature an Olympic ice hockey tournament held on artificial ice. A new stadium was built for the hockey tournament in a residential area of eastern Oslo, called Jordal Amfi, which accommodated 10,000 spectators in stands rising steeply from the rink. 23 of the 36 hockey matches were played at Jordal Amfi, with the remaining matches played at Kadettangen, Dælenenga idrettspark, Lillestrøm Stadion and Marienlyst Stadion.

The cross-country races and ski-jump competition were held at Holmenkollbakken, located roughly from the center of Oslo. The expected number of spectators caused concerns about traffic, so a new road was constructed and the existing thoroughfare widened. Holmenkollbakken was built in 1892 and improvements were needed to meet international standards. The original wood ski-jump was replaced with a concrete tower and jump that was long. New stands were built to seat 13,000 people, and an area was added at the base of the hill to accommodate 130,000 spectators.

The hills and terrain in the surrounding area met the competitive demands for an elite cross-country ski event. A notice board was posted at the start and finish lines to help spectators monitor the progress of the competitors. The cross-country and Nordic combined races began and ended at the base of the ski jump hill. The stands for the ski jump competition had to be removed during the cross-country races; spectators had only a small area from which to watch the races but were allowed on the course to cheer on the competitors.

The alpine skiing events were split between Norefjell and Rødkleiva. The slalom courses were at Rødkleiva, located on the same mountain as Holmenkollen and Frognerseteren. The course had an elevation difference, from start to finish, of and was in length. A rope tow had to be built to bring the skiers from the bottom to the top of the hill. The downhill race and the giant slalom—which made its Olympic debut in 1952—were held at Norefjell, which was from Oslo and the only venue located away from the capital city. Work had to be done to make the area suitable for Olympic competition. A bridge across Lake Krøderen was built to help alleviate transportation congestion. A new hotel, two ski lifts, and a new road were also constructed.

There was no permanent bobsleigh run in Norway. Instead the organizers built a temporary course out of snow and ice. This is often wrongly assumed to have been built at Korketrekkeren. From Frognerseteren a separate long, 13-turn course was designed and built. The bobsleigh run was first constructed and tested in 1951, then rebuilt for the Games in 1952. A car was used to return the bobsleighs to the start of the track.

==Participating nations==
Thirty nations sent competitors, which was the highest number of participants at a Winter Games. New Zealand and Portugal took part in the Winter Olympic Games for the first time. Australia, Germany, and Japan returned after a 16-year absence. South Korea, Liechtenstein, and Turkey competed in 1948 but did not participate in the 1952 Games.

===Number of athletes by National Olympic Committees===

==Calendar==

<doc id="143563" wikidata="Q6453423" url="?curid=143563" title="Isle of Lewis">
<text>The Isle of Lewis () or simply Lewis () is the northern part of Lewis and Harris, the largest island of the Western Isles or Outer Hebrides archipelago in Scotland. The two parts are frequently referred to as if they were separate islands. The total area of Lewis is .

Lewis is, in general, the lower-lying part of the island: the other part, Harris, is more mountainous. Due to its larger area and flatter, more fertile land, Lewis contains three-quarters of the population of the Western Isles, and the largest settlement, Stornoway. The island&#x27;s diverse habitats are home to an assortment of flora and fauna, such as the golden eagle, red deer and seal, and are recognised in a number of conservation areas.

Lewis has a Presbyterian tradition and a rich history. It was once part of the Norse Kingdom of the Isles. Today, life is very different from elsewhere in Scotland, with Sabbath observance, the Scottish Gaelic language and peat cutting retaining more importance than elsewhere. Lewis has a rich cultural heritage as can be seen from its myths and legends as well as the local literary and musical traditions.

==Name==

The Scottish Gaelic name may be derived from Norse (&#x27;song house&#x27;), although other origins have been suggested – most notably the Gaelic (&#x27;marshy&#x27;). It is probably the place referred to as by Ptolemy, which also means &#x27;marshy&#x27;. It is also known as the &quot;Isle of Lewis&quot; (Gaelic: ). Another name usually used in a cultural or poetic context is (&#x27;Heather Isle&#x27;), although this refers to the whole of the island of Lewis and Harris.

== History ==

The earliest evidence of human habitation on Lewis is found in peat samples which indicate that about 8,000 years ago much of the native woodland was torched to make way for browse plants to allow deer to browse. The earliest archaeological remains date from about 5,000 years ago. At that time, people began to settle in permanent farms rather than following their herds. The small houses of these people have been found throughout the Western Isles; in particular, at Dail Mòr, Carloway. The more striking great monuments of this period are the temples and communal burial cairns at places like Calanais (English: Callanish).
About 500 BC, island society moved into the Iron Age. The buildings became larger and more prominent, culminating in the brochs – circular, dry-stone towers belonging to the local chieftains – which testify to the uncertain nature of life then. The best remaining example of a broch in Lewis is at Dùn Chàrlabhaigh (English: Dun Carloway). The Scots arrived during the first centuries AD, bringing the Scottish Gaelic language with them. As Christianity began to spread through the islands in the 6th and later centuries, following Columban missionaries, Lewis was inhabited by the Picts.

In the 9th century AD, the Vikings began to settle on Lewis, after years of raiding from the sea. The Norse invaders intermarried with local people and abandoned their pagan beliefs. At that time, rectangular buildings began to supersede round ones, following the Scandinavian style. Lewis became part of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles, an offshoot of Norway. The Lewis chessmen, found on the island in 1831, date from the time of Viking rule. The people were called the Norse Gaels or Gall-Ghàidheil (lit. &quot;Foreigner Gaels&quot;), reflecting their mixed Scandinavian/Gaelic background, and probably their bilingual speech. The Norse language persists in many island placenames and some personal names to this day, although the latter are fairly evenly spread across the Gàidhealtachd.

Lewis (and the rest of the Western Isles) became part of Scotland once more in 1266: under the Treaty of Perth it was ceded by the Kingdom of Norway. Under Scottish rule, the Lordship of the Isles emerged as the most important power in north-western Scotland by the 14th century. The Lords of the Isles were based on Islay, but controlled all of the Hebrides. They were descended from Somerled (Somhairle) Mac Gillibride, a Gall-Ghàidheil lord who had held the Hebrides and West Coast two hundred years earlier. Control of Lewis itself was initially exercised by the Macleod clan, but after years of feuding and open warfare between and even within local clans, the lands of Clan MacLeod were forfeited to the Scottish Crown in 1597 and were awarded by King James VI to a group of Lowland colonists known as the Fife adventurers in an attempt to anglicise the islands. However the adventurers were unsuccessful, and possession passed to the Mackenzies of Kintail in 1609, when Coinneach, Lord MacKenzie, bought out the lowlanders.

Following the 1745 rebellion, and Prince Charles Edward Stewart&#x27;s flight to France, the use of Scottish Gaelic was discouraged, rents were demanded in cash rather than kind, and the wearing of folk dress was made illegal. Emigration to the New World increasingly became an escape for those who could afford it during the latter half of the century. In 1844 Lewis was bought by Sir James Matheson, co-founder of Jardine Matheson, but subsequent famine and changing land use forced vast numbers off their lands and increased the flood of emigrants again. Paradoxically, those who remained became ever more congested and impoverished, as large tracts of arable land were set aside for sheep, deerstalking or grouse shooting. Agitation for land resettlement became acute on Lewis during the economic slump of the 1880s, with several land raids (in common with Skye, Uist and Tiree); this quietened down as the island economy recovered.

During the First World War, thousands of islanders served in the forces, many losing their lives, including 208 naval reservists from the island who were returning home after the war when the Admiralty yacht sank within sight of Stornoway harbour. Many servicemen from Lewis served in the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy during the Second World War, and again many people died. Afterwards, many more inhabitants emigrated to the Americas and mainland Scotland.

In May 1918 the Isle of Lewis was purchased by the soap magnate Lord Leverhulme, who intended to make Stornoway an industrial town and build a fish cannery. His plans were initially popular, but his opposition to land resettlement led to further land raids, especially around the farms of Coll, Gress and Tong. These raids, commemorated in monuments in several villages, were ultimately successful, as the government was prepared to take legal action in support of land resettlement. Faced with this, Leverhulme gave up on his plans for Lewis and concentrated his efforts on Harris, where the town of Leverburgh takes his name.

== Geography and geology ==

Much of Lewis consists of mostly sandy beaches backed by dunes and machair on the Atlantic west coast, giving way to an expansive peat-covered plateau in the centre of the island. The eastern coastline is markedly more rugged and is mostly rocky cliffs broken by small coves and beaches. The more fertile nature of the eastern side led to the majority of the population settling there, including the largest settlement and only town, Stornoway. Aside from the village of Achmore in the centre of the island, all settlements are on the coast.

Compared with Harris, Lewis is relatively flat, except in the south-west, where Mealaisbhal, , is the highest point, and in the south-east, where Beinn Mhor reaches ; but there are 16 high points exceeding in height. Southern Lewis also has a large number of freshwater lochs compared to the north of the island.

South Lewis, Harris and North Uist together comprise a National Scenic Area. There are four geographical Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) on Lewis – Glen Valtos, Cnoc a&#x27; Chapuill, Port of Ness and Tolsta Head.

The coastline is severely indented, creating a number of large sea lochs, such as Lochs Resort and Seaforth, which form part of the border with Harris, Loch Roag, which surrounds the island of Great Bernera, and Loch Erisort. The principal capes are the Butt of Lewis, in the extreme north, with hundred foot (30 m) cliffs (the high point is high) and crowned with a lighthouse, the light of which is visible for ; Tolsta Head, Tiumpan Head and Cabag Head, on the east; Renish Point, in the extreme south; and, on the west, Toe Head and Gallon Head. The largest island associated with Lewis is Bernera or Great Bernera in the district of Uig and is linked to the mainland of Lewis by a bridge opened in 1953.

=== Geology ===

The geology of Lewis is dominated by the metamorphic gneisses of the eponymous Lewisian complex. Exceptions are a patch of granite near Carloway, small bands of intrusive basalt at Gress and in Eye Peninsula and some sandstone at Stornoway, Tong, Vatisker and Carloway, which was originally thought to be Torridonian, but is now considered more likely to be Permo-Triassic in age.

== Climate ==
Exposure to the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream lead to a cool, moist climate on Lewis. There is relatively little temperature difference between summer and winter, both of which are moderately cloudy (although cloud and wet weather often blows over quickly in summer). Both seasons also have significant rainfall and frequent high winds, particularly during the autumn equinox. These winds have led to Lewis being designated a potential site for a significant wind-farm, which has caused much controversy amongst the population.
== Nature ==

There are 15 Sites of Special Scientific Interest on Lewis in the biology category, spread across the island. Additionally, the Lewis Peatlands are recognised by Scottish Natural Heritage as a Special Protection Area, Special Area of Conservation and a Ramsar site, showing their importance as a wetland habitat for migratory and resident bird life.

=== Birds ===
Many species of seabirds inhabit the coastal areas of Lewis, including shag, gannet, fulmar, kittiwake, guillemot, and gulls. Red grouse and woodcock are found in the interior.

In the Uig hills, it is possible to spot both golden and white-tailed eagles. In the Pairc area, oystercatchers and curlews can be seen. A few pairs of peregrine falcons inhabit the coastal cliffs and merlin and buzzard are common everywhere on hill and moor. An important feature of the winter bird life is the great diversity of wildfowl. Several species of waterfowl, including eider and long-tailed duck, are found in the shallow water around Lewis.

=== Marine life ===
Salmon frequent several Lewis rivers after crossing the Atlantic. Many of the fresh-water lochs are home to fish such as trout. Other freshwater fish present include Arctic char, European eel, 3 and 9 spined sticklebacks, thick-lipped mullet and flounder.

Offshore, it is common to see grey seals, particularly in Stornoway harbour, and with luck, dolphins, harbour porpoises, sharks and even the occasional whale can be encountered.

=== Land mammals ===
There are only two native land mammals in the Western Isles: red deer and otter. The rabbit, mountain hare, hedgehog, feral cat, polecat and both brown and black rats were introduced. The origin of mice and voles is uncertain.

American mink, another introduced species (escapees from fur farms), cause problems for native ground-nesting birds, the local fishing industry and poultry farmers. Mink have been successfully eradicated from the Uists and Barra. The second and ongoing phase of the Hebridean Mink Project aims to rid Lewis and Harris of mink in similar fashion.

There are claims that the Stornoway castle grounds are home to bats. In addition, some residents keep farm animals such as Hebridean sheep, Highland cattle or kyloe and a few pigs.

=== Reptiles and amphibians ===
In common with Ireland, no snakes inhabit Lewis, only the slowworm which is merely mistaken for a snake. Actually, a legless lizard, it is the sole member of its order present. The common frog may be found in the centre of the island though it, along with any newts or toads present are introduced species.

=== Insects ===
The island&#x27;s most famous insect resident is the Scottish midge which is ever-present near water at certain times of the year.

During the summer months, several species of butterflies and dragonflies can be found, especially around Stornoway.

The richness of insect life in Lewis is evident from the abundance of carnivorous plants that thrive in parts of the island.

===Flora===
The machair is noted for different species of orchid and associated vegetation such as various grasses. Three heathers; ling, bell heather and cross-leaved heath are predominant in the large areas of moorland vegetation which also holds large numbers of insectivorous plants such as sundews. The expanse of heather-covered moorland explains the name &quot;Eilean an Fhraoich&quot;, Scottish Gaelic for &quot;The Heather Isle&quot;.

Lewis was once covered by woodland, but the only natural woods remaining are in small pockets on inland cliffs and on islands within lochs, away from fire and sheep. In recent years, Forestry Commission plantations of spruce and pine were planted, although most of the pines were destroyed by moth infestation. The most important mixed woods are those planted around Lews Castle in Stornoway, dating from the mid-19th century.

== Politics and government ==
Historically, while Harris was part of Inverness-shire, Lewis was part of Ross-shire or Ross and Cromarty. The Western Isles Islands Council was established in 1975. Now called Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, its remit covers the whole of the Outer Hebrides and its headquarters are in Stornoway.

Lewis is home to the majority of the Western Isles&#x27; electorate and six of the nine multi-member council wards are within Lewis and one is shared with Harris. 22 councillors are effectively elected by Lewis residents using the Single Transferable Vote system, and following the 2007 elections 19 are independents, one has Labour and two SNP party affiliation.

The Isle of Lewis is in the Highlands electoral region and is part of the identical Na h-Eileanan an Iar Scottish Parliamentary and Na h-Eileanan an Iar Westminster constituencies, currently represented by a member of the Scottish National Party (SNP) and by a member of the Labour Party after the last election.

=== Current representatives ===
* UK Parliament: Torcuil Crichton MP (Labour Party), first elected in 2024
* Scottish Parliament: Alasdair Allan MSP (SNP), first elected in 2007

== Demographics ==
Lewis&#x27; main settlement, the only burgh on the Outer Hebrides, is Stornoway (Scottish Gaelic: Steòrnabhagh), from which ferries sail to Ullapool on the Scottish mainland. In the 2011 census Lewis had a population of 19,658.

The island&#x27;s settlements are on or near the coasts or sea lochs, being particularly concentrated on the north east coast. The interior of the island is a large area of moorland from which peat was traditionally cut as fuel, although this practice has become less common. The southern part of the island, adjoining Harris, is more mountainous with inland lochs.

=== Parishes and districts of Lewis ===
* There are four parishes: Barvas (&quot;Barabhas&quot;), Lochs (&quot;Na Lochan&quot;), Stornoway (&quot;Steòrnabhagh&quot;), and Uig on which the original civil registration districts were based. The district of Carloway (after the village of that name) which hitherto had fallen partly within the parishes of Lochs and Uig, became a separate civil registration district in 1859.
* The districts of Lewis are Ness (&quot;Nis&quot;), Carloway (&quot;Càrlabhagh&quot;), Back, Lochs (&quot;Na Lochan&quot;), Park (&#x27;), Point (&#x27;), Stornoway, West Side, Bernera and Uig. These designations are traditional and in use by the entire population.
* For civil registration purposes Lochs (&#x27;) is nowadays split into North Lochs (&#x27;) and South Lochs (&quot;).
* The West Side is a generic designation for the area covering the villages from Borve to Dalbeg (&quot;).

It is claimed that the site of the Stornoway War Memorial was chosen as it would be visible from at least one location in each of the four parishes; therefore, it may be possible to see all four parishes of Lewis from the top of the monument.
=== Settlements ===
While Lewis has only one town, Stornoway, with a population of approx 8,000, there are also several large villages and groupings of villages on Lewis, such as North Tolsta, Carloway and Leurbost with significant populations. Near Stornoway, Laxdale, Sandwick and Holm, although still de facto villages, have now become quasi-suburbs of Stornoway. The population of the greater-Stornoway area including these (and other) villages would be nearer 12,000.
The island of Great Bernera contains the first planned crofting township created in the Outer Hebrides, Kirkibost created in 1805. This village was subsequently &#x27;cleared&#x27; in 1823 and re-settled in 1878 using the exact land lotting divisions from 1805.

== Economy ==

Traditional industries on Lewis are crofting, fishing and weaving. Though historically important, they are currently in decline and crofting in particular is little more than a subsistence venture today. Over 40% of the working population is employed by the public sector (chiefly Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, the local authority; and NHS Western Isles). Tourism is the only growing commercial industry.

According to the Scottish Government, &quot;tourism is by far and away the mainstay industry&quot; of the Outer Hebrides, &quot;generating £65m in economic value for the islands, sustaining around 1000 jobs&quot;. The report adds that the &quot;islands receive 219,000 visitors per year&quot;. The Outer Hebrides tourism bureau states that 10–15% of economic activity on the islands was made up of tourism in 2017. The agency states that the &quot;exact split between islands is not possible&quot; when calculating the number of visits, but &quot;the approximate split is Lewis (45%), Uist (25%), Harris (20%), Barra (10%)&quot;.

Despite the name, the Harris tweed industry is today focused in Lewis, with the major finishing mills in Shawbost and Stornoway. Every length of cloth produced is stamped with the official Orb symbol, trademarked by the Harris Tweed Association in 1909, when Harris Tweed was defined as &quot;hand-spun, hand-woven and dyed by the crofters and cottars in the Outer Hebrides&quot;; Machine-spinning and vat dyeing have since replaced hand methods, and only weaving is now conducted in the home, under the governance of the Harris Tweed Authority, established by an Act of Parliament in 1993. Harris Tweed is now defined as &quot;hand woven by the islanders at their homes in the Outer Hebrides, finished in the islands of Harris, Lewis, North Uist, Benbecula, South Uist and Barra and their several purtenances (The Outer Hebrides) and made from pure virgin wool dyed and spun in the Outer Hebrides.&quot;

Aside from the concentration of industry and services in the Stornoway area, many of the historical sites have associated visitor centres, shops or cafes. There is a pharmaceutical plant near Breasclete which specialises in fatty acid research.

The main fishing fleet (and associated shoreside services) in Stornoway is somewhat reduced from its heyday, but many smaller boats perform inshore creel fishing and operate from smaller, local harbours right around Lewis. There are fish farms in many of the sea lochs, and along with the onshore processing and transportation required the industry as a whole is a major employer.

=== Commerce ===
Stornoway is the commercial centre of Lewis; there are several national chains with shops in the town, two national supermarket chains as well as numerous local businesses. Outwith Stornoway, many villages have an all-purpose shop (often combined with a post office). Some villages have more than one, with these usually being specialist stores such as pharmacies or petrol stations. There are almost no rural public houses (for the sale of alcohol); instead, local hotels or inns function as meeting, eating and drinking places, often with accommodation provided. Recently, Abhainn Dearg distillery at Carnish, Uig, on the Isle of Lewis is producing Scotch whisky, the first legal whisky in over 200 years.

Itinerant, travelling shops also tour the island visiting some of the more remote locations. The ease of transport to Stornoway and the advent of the internet have led to many of the village shops closing in recent times. Mobile banking services are provided to remote villages by the Royal Bank of Scotland&#x27;s travelling bank.

=== Transport ===
 A daily Caledonian MacBrayne ferry (MV &quot;Loch Seaforth&quot;) sails from Stornoway to Ullapool on the Scottish mainland, taking 2 hours 30 minutes connecting Lewis with the mainland. There are two return crossings a day, with one on a Sunday in the winter. Other ferries sailing from Harris are easily accessible by road, enabling transport to Skye and Uist.

Suggestions for the possibility of an undersea tunnel linking Lewis to the Scottish mainland were raised in early 2007. One of the possible routes, between Stornoway and Ullapool, would be over long and hence the longest road tunnel in the world; however, shorter routes would be possible.

Stornoway is the public transport hub of Lewis, with bus services to Point, Ness, Back and Tolsta, Uig, the West Side, Lochs and Tarbert, Harris. These services are provided by the local authority and several private operators as well as some community-run organisations.

Stornoway Airport is away from the town itself and is located next to the village of Melbost. Loganair operate services to Edinburgh, Inverness and Glasgow. Hebridean Air Services operate a service to Benbecula. Eastern Airways flights to Aberdeen ended in November 2018. The airport is the base of a HM Coastguard Search &amp; Rescue Sikorsky S-92 helicopter and was previously home to RAF Stornoway.

=== Peats ===
 Peat is still cut as a fuel in many areas of Lewis. Peat is usually cut in late spring with a tool called a &quot;tairsgeir&quot; (that is, a peat iron, peat spade, peat knife or tosg; sometimes &quot;toirsgian&quot;) which has a long wooden handle with an angled blade on one end. The peat bank is first cleared of heather turfs. The peat, now exposed, is cut using the &quot;tairsgeir&quot; and the peats thrown out on the bank to dry. A good peat cutter can cut 1000 peats in a day.

Once dried, the peats are carted to the croft and built into a large stack. These often resembled the shape of the croft house – broad, curved at each end and tapered to a point about 2 metres high. They varied in length from about 4 to 14 metres. Peat stacking also follows local customs and a well-built peat stack can be a work of art. Peat stacks provide additional shelter to houses. A croft can burn as many as 15,000–18,000 peats in a year.

The odour of the peat-smoke, especially in wintertime, can add to the general atmosphere of the island. While peat burning still goes on, there has been a significant decline in recent years as people move to other, less labour-intensive forms of heating; however, it remains an important symbol of island life. In 2008, with the large increase in the price (and theft) of liquefied petroleum gas and heating oil, there were signs that there may be a return to peat cutting.

== Religion ==
Religion is important in Lewis, with much of the population belonging to the Free Church or the Church of Scotland (both Presbyterian in tradition). The Sabbath is generally observed, with most shops and licensed premises closed on that day, although there has been a scheduled air service to mainland Scotland as well as a scheduled ferry service since 19 July 2009.

While Presbyterianism dominates Lewis, other denominations and other religions have a presence, with a Catholic church, a Scottish Episcopal Church (part of the Anglican Communion); there is also a Catholic priest of the Anglican Ordinariate in Stornoway, a Salvation Army corps, a Pentecostal church (New Wine Church), a Plymouth Brethren church, a Baptist church, a meetinghouse of the LDS Church and a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness Kingdom Hall all present in Stornoway. The island&#x27;s first mosque opened in Stornoway in May 2018.

Some churches in Lewis practise precenting the line, a distinctive, heterophonic style of congregational psalm singing in Scottish Gaelic.

== Education ==

School education in Lewis is under the remit of Comhairle nan Eilean Siar. There are a total of 15 schools covering the 5–18 age range. Unusual features are the prevalence of Scottish Gaelic medium education (offered in 12 of 14 primary schools) and the Nicolson Institute, the only secondary school on the island. The large number of village schools led to necessarily small rolls, and falls in pupil numbers led to the closures of all of the rural secondary departments and some of the primary schools.

Stornoway is home to a small campus of the University of Stirling, teaching nursing, which is based in &quot;Ospadal nan Eilean&quot; (Western Isles Hospital). There is also a further education college, Lews Castle College, which is part of the UHI Millennium Institute. The college is the umbrella organisation for other vocational and community education, offered in several rural learning centres as well as on the main campus and covering subjects such as basic computer skills, Scottish Gaelic language classes and maritime qualifications.

== Culture and sport ==

=== Language ===

Lewis has a linguistic heritage rooted in Scottish Gaelic and Old Norse, which both continue to influence life in Lewis. Today, both Scottish Gaelic and English are spoken in Lewis, but in day-to-day life, a hybrid of English and Scottish Gaelic is very common. As a result of the Scottish Gaelic influence, the Lewis accent of Highland English is frequently considered to sound more Irish or Welsh than stereotypically Scottish in some quarters. The Scottish Gaelic culture in the Western Isles is more prominent than in any other part of Scotland. Scottish Gaelic is the language of choice amongst many islanders and around 60% of islanders speak Scottish Gaelic as a daily language, whilst 70% of the resident population have some knowledge of Scottish Gaelic (including reading, writing, speaking or a combination of the three). The Gaelic Language is considered to be unstable in the Western Isles, though there are some efforts to stabilise, including Gaelic medium education and the Gaelic cultural centre and community café, An Taigh Cèilidh, in Stornoway. 

Most of the place names in Lewis and Harris come from Old Norse. The name &quot;Lewis&quot; is the English spelling of the Scottish Gaelic &quot;Leòdhas&quot; which comes from the Old Norse &quot;Ljóðhús&quot;, as Lewis is named in medieval Norwegian maps of the island. Various suggestions have been made as to a Norse meaning such as &quot;song house&quot;. The name is not of Gaelic origin, the Norse credentials are questionable and it may have a pre-Celtic root.

=== Media and the arts ===
As well as regularly playing host to the Royal National Mòd, there are annual local mòds. Stornoway Castle Green hosts the annual 3-day Hebridean Celtic Festival in July, attracting over 10,000 visitors. The festival includes events such as cèilidhs, dances and special concerts featuring storytelling, song and music with performers from all round the Isles and beyond. &quot;Sad Day We Left the Croft&quot; is a 2007 compilation album of punk bands from Lewis.

The radio station Isles FM is based in Stornoway and broadcasts on 103FM, featuring a mixture of Scottish Gaelic and English programming. The town is also home to a studio operated by BBC Radio nan Gàidheal, and Studio Alba, an independent television studio from where the Scottish Gaelic TV channel TeleG was broadcast.

The &quot;Stornoway Gazette&quot; is the main local paper, covering Lewis and beyond and is published weekly. &quot;The Hebridean&quot; is a sister paper of the Gazette and also provides local coverage. Some community organisations in the rural districts have their own publications with news and features for these particular areas, such as the &quot;Rudhach&quot; for the Point district.

Lewis has been home to, or inspired, many writers, including bestselling contemporary author Kevin MacNeil, whose cult novel &quot;The Stornoway Way&quot; was set in the island&#x27;s capital. In April 2020, the Isle of Lewis Distillery published a list of 10 recommended books that feature the Outer Hebrides. Parts of the crime/mystery series by author GR Jordan are also set in this area, with the action in &quot;Water&#x27;s Edge&quot; and &quot;Horror Weekend&quot; taking place primarily on the Isle. 
=== Sport ===
There is a good provision of sporting grounds and sports centres in Lewis. Sports such as football, rugby union and golf are popular:

* Football, which grew in popularity after the first World War, is the most popular amateur sport in Lewis with Goathill Park in Stornoway hosting special matches involving select teams and visiting clubs and other organisations. Local teams currently participate in the Lewis and Harris Football League.
* Shinty which was traditionally played in the island as in the rest of the Scottish Gaelic-speaking areas of Scotland, died out by the mid-20th century at the latest. However, it was revived in the 1990s and there is now a strong local club known as Lewis Camanachd which competes in national competition.
* The village of Tong about from Stornoway plays host to the Highland Games and the Western Isles Strongest man competition each summer.
* Attached to the Nicolson Institute School is the Ionad Spors Leòdhais (Lewis Sports Centre), an all-weather pitch and running track.
* The Lews Castle Grounds is the home of Stornoway Golf Club (the only 18-hole golf course in the Outer Hebrides).
* Angling is a very popular pastime in Lewis as there are several good lochs and rivers for fishing.
* As Lewis is an island, various water sports, such as surfing are popular activities.
* Lewis has a terrain very suited to hillwalking, particularly in Uig and near the &quot;border&quot; with Harris.

=== Myths and legends ===

The Isle of Lewis has a rich folklore, including &quot;Seonaidh&quot; – a water-spirit who had to be offered ale in the area of Teampull Mholuaidh in Ness – and &quot;The Blue Men&quot; who inhabited the Minch, between Lewis and the Shiants.

=== Gastronomy ===

* Each year, men from Ness go out to the island of Sula Sgeir in late August for two weeks to harvest young gannets known locally as Guga, which are a local delicacy.

<doc id="143565" wikidata="Q1122196" url="?curid=143565" title="Harris, Outer Hebrides">
<text>Harris (, ) is the southern and more mountainous part of Lewis and Harris, the largest island in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. Although not an island itself, Harris is often referred to in opposition to the &quot;Isle of Lewis&quot; as the Isle of Harris, which is the former postal county and the current post town for Royal Mail postcodes starting HS3 or HS5.

The civil parish of Harris is considered to include St Kilda, a now uninhabited archipelago west-northwest of North Uist, and the uninhabited islet Rockall, which is west of North Uist.

==Etymology==
The Vikings arrived in the British Isles from the late 700s, and in the Northern Isles and Western Isles of Scotland they named places as part of their conquest. Documents from several centuries ago show the Isle of Harris being referred to as Haray or Harray, Here or Herre, Herrie, and the plural Harreis; as well as possibly related place names such as Harris on the isle of Rum; Herries in Dumfries; Harray on Orkney; and Harrastadhir (Harrastaðir) in Iceland. The place-name &quot;Harris&quot; has been suggested to be based on Old Norse &quot;hærri&quot;, meaning &#x27;higher&#x27;, a reference to the high hills, especially in comparison with the much flatter Lewis lying to the north.

The name of this island in Gaelic is &quot;Na h-Earradh&quot;. The isles of the Hebrides once had Gaelic names, however the Norsemen renamed them.

The Gaelic name &quot;Na Hearadh&quot; was also an earlier term for the Rinns of Islay.

Most of the place names on Harris are Gaelicized Old Norse.

Harris is most likely to be the island referred to as &quot;Adru&quot; (meaning &#x27;thick, stout or bulky&#x27;) on Ptolemy&#x27;s map of the British Isles.

==Gaelic==
, there were 1,212 Gaelic speakers in Harris, corresponding to roughly 60% of the population.

==Geography==

The boundary between Lewis and Harris is approximately a line from the head of Loch Resort on the west coast to the closest point of Loch Seaforth on the east coast. Harris itself divides naturally into northern and southern parts which are separated by West and East Loch Tarbert. These halves are joined by a narrow isthmus at the main settlement of Tarbert (&quot;An Tairbeart&quot; or &quot;Tairbeart na Hearadh&quot;).

The bedrock of Harris is largely Lewisian gneisses, which were laid down in the Precambrian period, interspersed with igneous intrusions. One of these intrusions forms the summit plateau of the mountain Roinebhal. The rock here is anorthosite, and is similar in composition to rocks found in the mountains of the Moon.

Harris is a part of historic Inverness-shire, and was administered as such under older administrative divisions. In the 2001 census, Harris had a usually resident population of 1,916. It is part of the South Lewis, Harris and North Uist National Scenic Area, one of 40 in Scotland.

===North Harris===

North Harris, adjoining Lewis, contains Clisham (&quot;An Cliseam&quot;), the highest mountain in the Outer Hebrides at . The area is sparsely populated. Beyond Tarbert, the furthest settlement is Hushinish (&quot;Hùisinis&quot;) on the west coast. A bridge from the east coast links Harris to the island of Scalpay (&quot;Sgalpaigh na Hearadh&quot;).

In March 2003 the North Harris Estate was purchased by the North Harris Trust, a development trust, on behalf of the local community. In April 2006 the Trust hosted the Highlands and Islands Community Energy Company conference &quot;Community Energy: Leading from the Edge&quot; in Tarbert. In early 2008 the Trust received planning consent for three 86 metre (282 ft) wind turbines to be located at Monan. In 2008 Mike Russell, the Scottish environment minister announced that the North Harris Trust had begun canvassing local opinion about a proposal to create Scotland&#x27;s third national park in the area.

===South Harris===

The southern part of Harris is less mountainous, with numerous unspoilt, white sandy beaches on the west coast. Its main settlements are Rodel (&quot;Roghadal&quot;), known for its medieval kirk of St. Clement (&quot;Eaglais Chliamhain&quot;), the most elaborate surviving medieval church in the Hebrides after Iona Abbey, and Leverburgh (&quot;An Tòb na Hearadh&quot; or &quot;An t-Òb na Hearadh&quot;). A ferry sails from the latter to Berneray (&quot;Beàrnaraigh na Hearadh&quot;), an island off the coast of North Uist (&quot;Uibhist a Tuath&quot;), to which it is joined by a causeway.

The east coast of south Harris is known as the Bays. The best known section called the &quot;Golden Road&quot; as it cost so much money to build, when it was built in 1897. It runs from Miavaig via Drinishader, Grosebay, Scadabay and Cluer to Stockinish. From Stockinish the road is the Bays and meanders through the coastal townships of Lickisto (&quot;Liceasto&quot;), Geocrab (&quot;Geòcrab&quot;), Manish (&quot;Mànais&quot;), Flodabay (&quot;Fleòideabhagh&quot;), Quidinish (&quot;Cuidhtinis&quot;), Finsbay (&quot;Fionnsbhagh&quot;) and Lingerbay (&quot;Lingreabhagh&quot;).

The beaches of Luskentyre and Scarista are amongst the most spectacular. From the former the island of Taransay, where the BBC Television series Castaway 2000 was recorded, is seen most clearly from Harris. At Scarista the beach is a venue for surfing and kite buggying. Nearby the Harris Golf Club offers well kept greens and views of the hills, but there is no play on Sundays. Scarista is the birthplace of the author Finlay J. MacDonald, who wrote about growing up on Harris in the 1930s. His books: &quot;Crowdie and Cream&quot;, &quot;Crotal and White&quot; and &quot;The Corncrake and the Lysander&quot; paint a vivid and humorous picture of Hebridean life.

===Tarbert===

Tarbert is the main port and main settlement of Harris, with a population of about 550. The name Tarbert comes from the Norse &quot;tairbeart&quot; meaning &quot;portage&quot; or &quot;isthmus&quot;. It is located on an isthmus between Loch Tarbert and West Loch Tarbert. The village has a ferry terminal, local tourist information and some small shops, including a Harris Tweed shop overlooking the main access road to the CalMac ferry terminal and a general grocery store. It is also home to the Harris Distillery.

===Scalpay===

The island of Scalpay is located at the mouth of East Loch Tarbert. It was known historically for its fishing industry, though little of that remains. The island was linked to Harris when the Scalpay Bridge was opened in 1997, connecting Scalpay to the settlement of Kyles on Harris.

Media attention has recently been drawn to angling on Harris, and Tarbert in particular. Local fishermen have been targeting large Common Skate in the area and have had prolific catches, mainly from West Loch Tarbert, in autumn and winter. There is an application for the Scottish shore record of although a fish estimated at was later landed. These catches have attracted the attention of the local and national press and sea angling&#x27;s leading magazines.

==Economy and transport==

In common with many parts of the Highlands and Islands, Harris has numerous single-track roads with passing places at intervals. Ferries sail from Tarbert to Uig in Skye.

According to the Scottish Government, &quot;tourism is by far and away the mainstay industry&quot; of the Outer Hebrides, &quot;generating £65m in economic value for the islands, sustaining around 1000 jobs&quot; The report adds that the &quot;islands receive 219,000 visitors per year&quot;. The Outer Hebrides tourism bureau states that 10–15% of economic activity on the islands was made up of tourism in 2017. The agency states that the &quot;exact split between islands is not possible&quot; when calculating the number of visits, but &quot;the approximate split is Lewis (45%), Uist (25%), Harris (20%), Barra (10%)&quot;.

Harris is known for Harris Tweed, although this textile is mostly made in Lewis, with the major finishing mills in Shawbost and Stornoway. Every length of cloth produced is stamped with the official Orb symbol, trademarked by the Harris Tweed Association in 1909. Harris Tweed is defined as &quot;hand woven by the islanders at their homes in the Outer Hebrides, finished in the islands of Harris, Lewis, North Uist, Benbecula, South Uist and Barra and their several purtenances (The Outer Hebrides) and made from pure virgin wool dyed and spun in the Outer Hebrides.&quot;

Tarbert is home to the Harris distillery, which has former Monsanto CEO, Hugh Grant among its directors. In 2018, the distillery was named Scottish Gin Distillery of the year at the annual Scottish Gin Awards, and in 2020, Harris Gin was voted favourite Scottish gin in the Scottish Gin Society Consumer Choice Awards for the third year in a row.

As of 2021, the company was marketing only gin, but had started production of Hearach&#x27; single malt Scotch whisky; it would be some years before that product would be available for sale.

==Education==
The Sir E. Scott secondary school in Tarbert serves the whole of the Isle of Harris and Scalpay. This school has a primary and secondary department and can educate up to sixth year. The school has a 21 kW photovoltaic system installed. There is also a Primary School, Leverhulme Memorial School, in Leverburgh.

==Religion==

Harris has a largely Presbyterian population that practises sabbatarianism: all retail outlets are shut on Sunday. This area has been described as the last bastion of Reformed fundamentalism in the UK, and there was controversy in 2006 when Caledonian MacBrayne started a Sunday ferry service. However, a Sunday ferry service between Berneray (North Uist) and Leverburgh (An t-Òb) in the south of Harris has been introduced with relatively little controversy and now operates all year round. This allowed travel to Lewis and Harris by ferry on a Sunday before the Sunday ferries to Stornoway started in 2009. The North Uist end of the connection can be reached by other ferry routes that also operate on Sundays (Uig-Lochmaddy and Oban-Lochboisdale).

== Media and the arts ==
Tinted shots of parts of the island were used by Stanley Kubrick as an alien landscape in the film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;.

In his 1962 novel &quot;Atlantic Fury&quot; Hammond Innes put a fictional Joint Services Guided Weapons Establishment in Northton, South Harris, where some of the action takes place.

The nearby island of Taransay became well known following the BBC show &quot;Castaway&quot; broadcast in 2000 and various scenes were shot on Harris itself. The film &quot;The Rocket Post&quot; was also filmed on Taransay in 2004. The film is based on the story of Gerhard Zucker, the German rocket scientist who in 1934 used the Isle of Scarp as his base for experimenting with sending mail over long distances by rocket.

The local newspaper is the &quot;Stornoway Gazette&quot;; there is also a community newspaper published fortnightly, called &quot;Dè Tha Dol&quot;?

== District tartan ==

A group of sixth-year pupils at the Sir E. Scott secondary school in Tarbert won the 2003 Young Enterprise UK Award for their design, marketing, and selling of the Isle of Harris district tartan. The tartan is officially registered with the Scottish Tartans Authority (under number 6198) and with the Scottish Tartans World Register (under #2981). Its symmetrical threadcount is listed as &quot;WW/8 B80 K8 LG16 K16 LB/24&quot;, with a colour palette of:

 pelorous blue #2888C4,&lt;br&gt; forest green #289C18,&lt;br&gt; dark grey #101010,&lt;br&gt; wilson white #FCFCFC, and&lt;br&gt; Windsor blue #2C2C80.

<text>North Uist (; ) is an island and community in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland.

==Etymology==
In Donald Munro&#x27;s &quot;A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland Called Hybrides&quot; of 1549, North Uist, Benbecula and South Uist are described as one island of &quot;Ywst&quot; (Uist). Starting in the south of this &#x27;island&#x27;, he described the division between South Uist and Benbecula where &quot;the end heirof the sea enters, and cuts the countrey be ebbing and flowing through it&quot;. Further north of Benbecula he described North Uist as &quot;this countrey is called Kenehnache of Ywst, that is in Englishe, the north head of Ywst&quot;.

Some have taken the etymology of Uist from Old Norse, meaning &quot;west&quot;, much like Westray in Orkney. Another speculated derivation of Uist from Old Norse is &#x27;, derived from &#x27; meaning &quot;an abode, dwelling, domicile&quot;.

A Gaelic etymology is also possible, with &#x27; meaning &quot;Crossings-island&quot; or &quot;Fords-island&quot;, derived from &#x27; meaning &quot;island&quot; and &#x27; meaning &quot;estuary, sand-bank, passage across at ebb-tide&quot;. Place-names derived from &#x27; include Fersit, and Belfast. (2003) suggests that a Gaelic derivation of &quot;Uist&quot; may be &quot;corn island&quot;. However, whilst noting that the &quot;&quot; ending would have been familiar to speakers of Old Norse as meaning &quot;dwelling&quot;, Gammeltoft (2007) says the word is &quot;of non-Gaelic origin&quot; and that it reveals itself as one of a number of &quot;foreign place-names having undergone adaptation in Old Norse&quot;. In contrast, Clancy (2018) has argued that &quot;Ívist&quot; itself is an Old Norse calque on an earlier Gaelic name, &quot;Ibuid&quot; or &quot;Ibdaig&quot;, which corresponds to Ptolemy’s &quot;Eboudai&quot;.

Coates (2006) linked the names &quot;Uist&quot; and &quot;Ibiza&quot;, an island in the Mediterranean, arguing for an origin in Semitic &quot;*bšm&quot; (&quot;balsam&quot;) with the island-naming prefix &quot;*’y&quot;, acknowledging the possibility of a name transfer and the name being subject to the influence of Norse &quot;ívist&quot;.

==History==
===Early history===
A number of standing stones from the Neolithic period are scattered throughout the island, including a stone circle at Pobull Fhinn. In addition to these, a large burial cairn, in almost pristine condition, is located at Barpa Langass. The island remained inhabited for at least part of the Bronze Age; a burial from this period was found on the Udal peninsula (near Sollas). For the Iron Age, in addition to the wheelhouses typical of the Outer Hebrides, the remains of a broch(fort), from the late Iron Age, can be found at Dun an Sticir; there was formerly another broch near Scolpaig, but it was replaced by Scolpaig Tower in the 19th century. In the 3rd century, stone houses came into use which were shaped like Jelly Babies.

===Kingdom of the Isles===

Whoever the occupants of &quot;Jelly Baby&quot; houses were, they were followed in the 9th century by Viking settlers, who established the Kingdom of the Isles throughout the Hebrides. Initially, Vikings built turf-based buildings; however, on the shore, the environmental and chemical composition of machair causes these buildings to rapidly degrade and turn mauve. Following Norwegian unification, the Kingdom of the Isles became a crown dependency of the Norwegian king; to the Norwegians it was &quot;Suðreyjar&quot; (meaning &quot;southern isles&quot;). Malcolm III of Scotland acknowledged in writing that Suðreyjar was not Scottish, and King Edgar quitclaimed any residual doubts.

However, in the mid-12th century, Somerled, a Norse-Gael of uncertain origin, launched a coup, which made Suðreyjar entirely independent. Following his death, Norwegian authority was nominally restored, but in practice, the kingdom was divided between Somerled&#x27;s heirs (Clann Somhairle), and the dynasty that Somerled had deposed (the Crovan dynasty). The MacRory, a branch of Somerled&#x27;s heirs, ruled Uist, as well as Barra, Eigg, Rùm, the Rough Bounds, Bute, Arran, and northern Jura.

In the 13th century, despite Edgar&#x27;s quitclaim, Scottish forces attempted to conquer parts of Suðreyjar, culminating in the indecisive Battle of Largs.

In 1266, the matter was settled by the Treaty of Perth, which transferred the whole of Suðreyjar to Scotland, in exchange for a very large sum of money. The treaty expressly preserved the status of the rulers of Suðreyjar; the MacRory lands, excepting Bute, Arran, and Jura, became the Lordship of Garmoran, a quasi-independent crown dependency, rather than an intrinsic part of Scotland.

===Lordship of Garmoran===
At the turn of the century, William I had created the position of Sheriff of Inverness, to be responsible for the Scottish highlands, which theoretically now extended to Garmoran. In 1293, however, King John Balliol established the Sheriffdom of Skye, which included the Outer Hebrides. Nevertheless, following his usurpation, the Skye sheriffdom ceased to be mentioned, and the Garmoran lordship (including Uist) was confirmed to the MacRory leader. In 1343, King David II issued a further charter for this to the latter&#x27;s son.

In 1346, just three years later, the sole surviving MacRory heir was Amy of Garmoran. The southern parts of the Kingdom of the Isles had become the Lordship of the Isles, ruled by the MacDonalds (another group of Somerled&#x27;s descendants). Amy married the MacDonald leader, John of Islay, but a decade later he divorced her, and married the king&#x27;s niece instead (in return for a substantial dowry). As part of the divorce, John deprived his eldest son, Ranald, of the ability to inherit the Lordship of the Isles, in favour of a son by his new wife. As compensation, John granted Lordship of the Uists to Ranald&#x27;s younger brother Godfrey, and made Ranald Lord of the remainder of Garmoran.

However, on Ranald&#x27;s death, his sons were still children, and Godfrey took the opportunity to seize the Lordship of Garmoran. Furthermore, Godfrey had a younger brother, Murdoch, whose heirs (the Siol Murdoch) now claimed to own part of North Uist. This led to a great deal of violent conflict involving Godfrey&#x27;s family (the Siol Gorrie) and those of his brothers. Surviving records do not describe this in detail, but traditional accounts report an incident where the Siol Gorrie dug away the embankment of a Loch, causing it to flood a nearby village in which the Siol Murdoch lived (and hence drown them); the accounts claim that the floodwater formed Loch Hosta.

In 1427, frustrated with the level of violence generally in the highlands, together with the insurrection caused by his own cousin, King James I demanded that highland magnates should attend a meeting at Inverness. On arrival, many of the leaders were seized and imprisoned. Alexander MacGorrie, son of Godfrey, was considered to be one of the two most reprehensible, and after a quick show trial, was immediately executed. As Alexander had by now inherited Godfrey&#x27;s de facto position as Lord of Garmoran, and in view of Ranald&#x27;s heirs being no less responsible for the violence, King James declared the Lordship forfeit.

===Early lairds===

====Hugh of Sleat and his sons====

Following the forfeiture, most of Garmoran (including North Uist) remained with the Scottish crown until 1469, when James III granted Lairdship of it to John of Ross, the Lord of the Isles. In turn, John passed it to his own half-brother, Hugh of Sleat; the grant to Hugh was confirmed by the king – James IV – in a 1493 charter, but Ranald&#x27;s heirs (Clan Ranald) disputed the charter.

Hugh died a few years later, and in 1505 his eldest son, John, granted North Uist (and Sleat) to Ranald Bane, the Captain of Clanranald; the reasons John had for this are not reported by surviving records. Nevertheless, Hugh&#x27;s second son, Donald &quot;Gallach&quot;, opposed Clan Ranald and established his own de facto control of North Uist and Sleat. In the following year (1506), Donald was stabbed to death by his own younger brother – Black Archibald. The king authorised Ranald Bane to take the lands by force; according to traditional accounts, Ranald Bane&#x27;s success led to Black Archibald resorting to piracy.
Three years later, however, Black Archibald returned. Traditional accounts relate that while he had been away, Angus Collach (Archibald&#x27;s other brother) attempted to rape a woman on North Uist; outraged by this, an armed party made up of men from the Siol Gorrie (to which the woman belonged) and Clan Ranald (to which her husband belonged) captured Angus and drowned him at sea. According to these accounts, Black Archibald now took revenge, killing large numbers of Siol Gorrie. Despite his behaviour, Black Archibald managed to ingratiate himself with James IV, by capturing and handing over two pirates – distant relations from Clan MacAlister; in 1511, the king rewarded Black Archibald by pardoning him for his crimes, and confirming his possession of Sleat and North Uist.

====The Hunchback====

At some point before 1520, Black Archibald was murdered by Donald Gallach&#x27;s son, Donald Gruamach. Consequently, in 1520, James IV issued a charter awarding lairdship of Sleat and North Uist to Alasdair Crotach MacLeod, the leader of the Sìol Tormoid, who possessed the neighbouring lands, and had been loyal to James during Donald Dubh&#x27;s rebellion.

In 1539, Donald Gruamach&#x27;s son – Donald Gorm – invaded the Siol Tormoid lands on Skye, in an attempt to take back Sleat and North Uist. However, that same year, Donald Gorm was hit by an arrow while besieging Eilean Donan castle; in the process of removing it, he severed an artery, and died. In 1542, king James V issued a charter confirming Alastair Crotach as laird of Sleat and North Uist.

====Mary MacLeod====

After the deaths of Alastair Crotach and his son William in quick succession (1547, and 1553, respectively), Alastair&#x27;s heir was his young granddaughter, Mary MacLeod. Donald Gormson, Donald Gorm&#x27;s son, took the opportunity to seize Sleat and North Uist. The Earl of Arran, regent to Mary, Queen of Scots, assigned nominal feudal wardship of her to the Earl of Huntly, who himself proposed to sell it to the Earl of Argyll. Following Arran&#x27;s death in 1554, Mary of Guise was appointed regent for her daughter and issued Argyll and Huntly with a &quot;commission of fire and sword&quot; against Donald Gormson and Clan Ranald, instructing the earls to pursue their &quot;utter extermination&quot;.

However, the forces of the Earl of Huntly had previously been defeated by Clan Ranald at the Battle of the Shirts, which made them reluctant to enter Clan Ranald territory; the Earl abandoned the pursuit, but was promptly imprisoned by Mary of Guise for doing so. Three years later, the Lords of the Congregation, the Earl of Argyll among them, emerged as an organised resistance to the Queen Regent. By 1562, the Earl of Huntly, now released, was in outright opposition to Queen Mary, and died opposing her at the Battle of Corrichel. In 1565 the tables turned when Donald Gormson took the queen&#x27;s side during the Chaseabout Raid and was consequently back in royal favour.

On 4 March 1567 Donald Gormson and the Earl of Argyll drew up a contract, according to which:
*Donald Gormson would enter a bond of manrent to the Earl of Argyll
*Donald Gormson would provide military aid to Mary MacLeod&#x27;s uncle, on demand from the Earl of Argyll
*Mary MacLeod would quitclaim her rights to Sleat and North Uist in return for 500 marks, to be paid by Donald Gormson
*The Earl of Argyll would persuade Queen Mary to grant him a charter for those lands, and subinfeudate them to Donald Gormson, in return for 1000 marks

====Old Blue-eyes====
In 1594, as an opponent of The Reformation, Donald Gorm Mor – Donald Gormson&#x27;s grandson – sent troops to Gaelic Ireland to assist Aodh Mór Ó Néill and Red Hugh O&#x27;Donnell during the Rising of the Northern Clans against Queen Elizabeth I of England. In 1596, concerned by this, and similar action by other Scottish clan chiefs, King James VI of Scotland (Elizabeth&#x27;s heir) demanded that highland leaders send well-armed men, as well as attending themselves, to meet him at Dumbarton on 1 August. Donald Gorm Mor obeyed the summons, and was consequently pardoned for previous offences, and granted a charter which acknowledged him as rightful heir of Hugh of Sleat, and confirmed him as laird of Sleat and North Uist.

In an attempt to solidify peaceful relations with the Siol Tormoid, Donald Gorm Mor married the daughter of the then Siol Tormoid leader, Rory Mor. Unfortunately, the marriage failed catastrophically, leading to the War of the One-Eyed Woman. A series of initial skirmishes led to the Battle of Carinish in North Uist, the last battle in Scotland that involved bows and arrows. It led to the Battle of Coire Na Creiche, where Donald Gorm Mor won a more decisive victory, at which point the privy council intervened, and imposed a lasting peace. Donald was succeeded by his nephew, Donald Gorm Og, whose loyalty to the king resulted in him being made the first Baronet of Sleat.

===Post-union===

====The Papists Act====

A century later, Sir Donald MacDonald, the 4th Baronet of Sleat, was living comfortably in Glasgow. In 1715, he supported the Jacobite rebellion and attacked the Earl of Sutherland, but fell ill and fled to Skye. He was pursued and forced to flee to North Uist. When the Papists Act was passed the following year, requiring his attendance at Inverlochy, he argued that he was too ill to travel, but magistrates could visit him instead. Under the terms of the act, this made him a recusant, and his lairdships were accordingly forfeited, under the terms of the Forfeited Estates Act of the previous year.

The Commissioners of Forfeited Estates surveyed the land and found that it was in very poor condition; in North Uist, the local population had recently lost 745 cows, 573 horses, and 820 sheep to plague, and the sea had overflowed the land and destroyed many houses. On his succession in 1723, the 7th baronet arranged for a middleman, Kenneth MacKenzie, to buy back Sleat and North Uist from the Commissioners and pass them on to him. In 1727, the 7th baronet was granted a royal charter formally acknowledging his position as laird of the Sleat and North Uist.

According to historian John Lorne Campbell, Sir Alexander MacDonald of Sleat and his clan took no part in the Jacobite Uprising of 1745, but they were included in the repression of Highland dress and culture that followed the Battle of Culloden. However, North Uist bard Iain Mac Fhearchair (John MacCodrum), the official poet to the chief, wrote the satirical poem &quot;Òran an Aghaidh an Eididh Ghallda&quot; (&quot;A Song Against the Lowland Garb&quot;), which &quot;shows clearly where his own sympathies lay&quot;.

MacCodrum also composed poetry criticizing both the Scottish clan chiefs and the Anglo-Scottish landlords of the Highlands and Islands for the often brutal mass evictions of the Scottish Gaels that followed the Battle of Culloden and on mundane topics such as old age and whiskey.

Among MacCodrum&#x27;s most popular anti-landlord poems mocks Aonghus MacDhòmhnaill, the post-Culloden tacksman of Griminish. It is believed to date from between 1769 and 1773, when overwhelming numbers of Sir Alexander MacDonald&#x27;s tenants on the isles of North Uist and Skye were reacting to his rackrenting and other harsh treatments by immigrating to the region surrounding the Cape Fear River in North Carolina. The song is known in the oral tradition of North Uist as &quot;Òran Fir Ghriminis&quot; (&quot;A Song of the Tacksman of Griminish&quot;). The song is equally popular among speakers of Canadian Gaelic in Nova Scotia, where it is known under the differing title, &quot;Òran Aimereaga&quot; (&quot;The Song of America&quot;).

====Kelp====

During the French Revolutionary Wars, the scarcity of external supplies of minerals to the United Kingdom led to a boom in the kelp industry, which became North Uist&#x27;s main source of income. When the war ended, the availability of foreign mineral supplies led to an abrupt collapse in the demand for kelp-based products. The burning of kelp had also damaged the fertility of the land. As a result, the crofters of North Uist could no longer afford the rents. Even though the landlords reduced the rents (e.g. in 1827 the rents were reduced by 20%) many crofters resorted to emigration.

In 1826 the villages of Kyles Berneray, Baile Mhic Coinein, and Baile Mhic Phàil, at the north-east corner of North Uist, were abandoned by their inhabitants. Although some moved further south-east to Loch Portain, most of those affected moved to Cape Breton, in Nova Scotia. As the economic conditions worsened, and with reports of islanders having success overseas, the numbers of families emigrating from Scotland to North America greatly increased. By 1838, the number of people having left North Uist was reported as 1,300; before the 1820s, the population of North Uist had been almost 5,000, but by 1841 it had fallen to 3,870.

====The Highland Clearances====

The 7th baronet&#x27;s heir, Godfrey MacDonald (the 4th Baron of Slate) ran sheep on the abandoned crofts. The land was poor for farming but sufficient to sustain sheep, bringing the baron a better profit. As a result, he orchestrated one of the most notable mass evictions of the Highland Clearances. In 1849, an attempt to evict 603 crofters from Sollas caused rioting. Rocks were reportedly thrown at the police officers sent from Glasgow to quell the riot. In the convictions that followed, the jury added the following written comments:
In 1855, Sir Godfrey decided to sell North Uist to Sir John Powlett Orde.

According to Bill Lawson, &quot;The MacDonalds of Sleat possessed the island from 1469 until 1855, though the later proprietors took little interest in their estate except as a source of income. In 1855 the Lord MacDonald of the day sold the island to Sir John Powlett Orde, who had gained the reputation of being the worst type of landlord, utterly opposed to any attempt to improve the lot of his tenants, though it is only fair to point out that every one of the major evictions on the island was in fact carried out by the MacDonalds; they, being of a local source, are forgiven, and the blame is reserved for the incoming Sir John. He, in turn, sold parts of the island to his son Sir Arthur Campbell-Orde, mainly in order to frustrate the terms of the Crofter&#x27;s Acts, which could have allowed crofters to apply for more land, but only on land with the same ownership. Sir Arthur eventually inherited the whole estate; he seems to have been a very different type of landlord, and was involved in the re-crofting of Sollas and other areas.&quot;

The pre-clearance population of North Uist was about 5,000. Families particularly depleted during the clearances were the MacAulays, Morrisons, MacCodrums, MacCuishs, and MacDonalds.

===Modern times===

In 1889, counties were formally created in Scotland, on shrieval boundaries, by a dedicated Local Government Act; North Uist, therefore, became part of the new county of Inverness. Following late 20th century reforms, it became part of the Highland Region.

In 1944, the Campbell-Orde family sold North Uist to Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 14th Duke of Hamilton, who in 1960 sold it in turn to the 5th Earl Granville, and the current laird is Fergus Leveson-Gower, 6th Earl Granville, who lives on the island. The Granville family administers the island through a trust fund called the North Uist Trust.

Some of the machair townships, however, were taken over by the Board of Agriculture and its successors.

The population of North Uist has dwindled to around 1,300.

== Geology ==
In common with the rest of the Western Isles, North Uist is formed from the oldest rocks in Britain, the Lewisian gneiss which dates from the Archaean eon. A zone running west from Lochmaddy to Baleshare has abundant metasediments and metavolcanics. The direction of inclination of layered textures or foliation in this metamorphic rock is typically to the north but varies widely across the island. Pockets of metabasic rocks equivalent to the Scourie dyke suite are developed in certain areas, particularly in the north. Banded metabasic rocks and Archaean granites are found in the northwest around Loch Phaibeil. A band of pseudotachylyte curves north the northwest through the centre of the island.
The island is traversed by numerous normal faults many of which run broadly NW-SE though ranging from E-W to NNW-SSE. Loch Eport is developed along one such fault. The Outer Hebrides Thrust Zone runs along the eastern coast of the island and brings distinctive gneisses which form the rough hilly terrain along that coast. More recent geological deposits include blown sand along the northern and western coasts and peat inland.

==Geography==
North Uist is the tenth-largest Scottish island and the thirteenth-largest island surrounding Great Britain. It has an area of , slightly smaller than South Uist. North Uist is connected by causeways to Benbecula via Grimsay, to Berneray, and to Baleshare. With the exception of the south east, the island is very flat, and covered with a patchwork of peat bogs, low hills and lochans, with more than half the land being covered by water. Some of the lochs contain a mixture of fresh and tidal salt water, giving rise to some complex and unusual habitats. Loch Sgadabhagh, about which it has been said &quot;there is probably no other loch in Britain which approaches Loch Scadavay in irregularity and complexity of outline&quot;, is the largest loch by area on North Uist although Loch Obisary has about twice the volume of water. The northern part of the island is part of the South Lewis, Harris and North Uist National Scenic Area, one of 40 in Scotland.

===Settlements===

The main settlement on the island is Lochmaddy, a fishing port and home to a museum, an arts centre and a . Caledonian MacBrayne ferries sail from the village to Uig on Skye, as well as from the island of Berneray (which is connected to North Uist by road causeway), to Leverburgh in Harris. Lochmaddy also has the Taigh Chearsabhagh — a museum and arts centre with a cafe, small shop and post office service. Nearby is the Uist Outdoor Centre.

The island&#x27;s main villages are Sollas, Hosta, Tigharry, Hougharry, Paible, Grimsay and Cladach Kirkibost. Other settlements include Clachan Carinish, Knockquien, Port nan Long, Greinetobht and Scolpaig, home to the nineteenth-century Scolpaig Tower folly. Loch Portain is a small hamlet on the east coast — some from Lochmaddy, with sub areas of Cheesebay and Hoebeg.

According to the 2011 census North Uist had a population of 1,254.

==Places of interest==
North Uist has many prehistoric structures, including the Barpa Langass chambered cairn, the Pobull Fhinn stone circle, Dun an Sticir, the Fir Bhreige standing stones, Eilean Dòmhnuill (which may be the earliest crannog site in Scotland), and the Baile Sear roundhouses, which were exposed by storms in January 2005.

The Vikings arrived in the Hebrides in AD 800 and developed large settlements.

Newer sites of interest are the Uist sculpture trail with two art installations in Lochmaddy. Close by is the Hut of Shadows, a camera obscura. 

On the Northern and western side of the island are several white sandy beaches such as Clachan Sands.

The island is known for its bird life, including corncrakes, Arctic terns, gannets, corn buntings and Manx shearwaters. The RSPB has a nature reserve at Balranald.

==Population==
In the 18th century, the total population of the combined Uists rose dramatically, before the population crash of the Highland Clearances. In 1755, the Uists&#x27; estimated combined population was 4,118; by 1794 it rose to 6,668; and in 1821 to 11,009.


==Gaelic==

* Iain Mac Fhearchair (alias John MacCodrum) (1693-1779) was a Scottish Gaelic poet who spent his life as the &quot;family bard to Sir James MacDonald of Sleat&quot;. One of his most popular songs is &quot;Smeòrach Chlann Dòmhnaill&quot; (&quot;The Mavis of Clan Donald&quot;), in which the bard &quot;praises the isle of his birth&quot;. The song was recorded by fellow North Uist native Julie Fowlis on her 2014 album &quot;Gach sgeul – Every story&quot;.
* The war poet Dòmhnall Ruadh Chorùna (1887–1967), a major figure in 20th-century Scottish Gaelic literature, was born on North Uist and lived his life there. Due to his vivid descriptions of his combat experiences during the First World War, he is often referred to as &quot;The Voice of the Trenches&quot;.

The penultimate segment of &quot;Lochdown&quot;, the 41st episode (3rd episode of 4th season) of the popular motoring television series The Grand Tour, was filmed on a narrow strait close to Griminish, at the northwest corner of the island, with the presenters building a floating bridge to drive their cars across to the island of Vallay (unlike suggested in the episode, the last segment was filmed in Swindon, not on Vallay).

<doc id="143569" wikidata="Q841059" url="?curid=143569" title="South Uist">
<text>South Uist (, ; ) is the second-largest island of the Outer Hebrides in Scotland. At the 2011 census, it had a usually resident population of 1,754: a decrease of 64 since 2001. The island, in common with the rest of the Hebrides, is one of the last remaining strongholds of the Gaelic language in Scotland. South Uist&#x27;s inhabitants are known in Gaelic as &quot;Deasaich&quot; (Southerners). The population is about 90% Roman Catholic.

The island is home to a nature reserve and a number of sites of archaeological interest, including the only location in the British Isles where prehistoric mummies have been found. In the northwest, there is a missile testing range. In 2006 South Uist, together with neighbouring Benbecula and Eriskay, was involved in Scotland&#x27;s biggest-ever community land buyout by Stòras Uibhist. The group also owns the &quot;biggest community wind farm in Scotland&quot;, Lochcarnan, on South Uist which opened in 2013.

== Geology ==
In common with the rest of the Western Isles, South Uist is formed from the oldest rocks in Britain, Lewisian gneiss brought to the surface by old tectonic movements. They bear the scars of the last glaciation which has exposed many of them. The rocks had high-grade regional metamorphism around 2,900 million years ago: in the Archaean eon. Some show granulite facies metamorphism, but most have slightly cooler amphibolite facies. A number of metabasic bodies and metasediments occur locally in the gneiss.

On the east side of the island between Lochboisdale and Ornish – part of the Outer Hebrides Thrust Zone – is the Corodale gneiss, dominated by garnet-pyroxene rock. A narrow zone of pseudotachylyte occurs along its western margin with the regular gneiss. The Usinish peninsula is formed from ‘mashed gneiss’, within which the banding has mainly been destroyed. Between these two gneisses is a band of mylonite (as offshore on Stuley). Mashed gneiss occurs again in the extreme southeast. Small occurrences of Archaean granites are found in the centre of the island.

The island is traversed by many normal faults: E to W, to NNW to SSE, many being NW to SE. Numerous NW to SE dykes cut through the island: quartz-dolerite, camptonite and monchiquite dykes of Permo-Carboniferous age and later Palaeogene tholeiitic dykes. More recent geological deposits include blown sand along the northern and western coasts and peat inland along with some (glacial) till.

== Geography ==
The west is machair (fertile low-lying coastal plain) with a continuous sandy beach, whilst the east coast is mountainous with the peaks of Beinn Mhòr (Gèideabhal) at and Hecla at . The island is linked to Eriskay and Benbecula by causeways.

The landscape is characterised by numerous lochs and lochans, the largest of which is Loch Bì.

The main village on the island is Lochboisdale (&quot;Loch Baghasdail&quot;), from which Caledonian MacBrayne operates ferries to Mallaig (&quot;Malaig)&quot; on the Scottish mainland (some sailings to Oban in winter when the only large vessel able to dock at Mallaig, MV Lord of the Isles, is covering elsewhere on the Calmac network for vessels in drydock, or in drydock herself). The company previously operated services to Castlebay (&quot;Bàgh a&#x27; Chaisteil&quot;) on Barra, however as of the 2016 fleet reshuffle these have been removed. There is a separate service to Ardmhòr (Barra) operating from Eriskay numerous times a day. (Smaller settlements include Daliburgh (&quot;Dalabrog&quot;), Howmore (&quot;Tobha Mòr&quot;) and Ludag (&quot;An Lùdag&quot;).

==Climate==
South Uist has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;).

==Etymology==
Mac an Tàilleir (2003) suggests that the derivation of &quot;Uist&quot; may be &quot;corn island&quot;. However, whilst noting that the &quot;vist&quot; ending would have been familiar to speakers of Old Norse as meaning &quot;dwelling&quot;, Gammeltoft (2007) says that the word is &quot;of non-Gaelic origin&quot; and that it reveals itself as one of a number of &quot;foreign place-names having undergone adaptation in Old Norse&quot;. In contrast, Clancy (2018) has argued that &quot;Ívist&quot; itself is an Old Norse calque on an earlier Gaelic name, &quot;*Ibuid&quot; or &quot;Ibdaig&quot;, which corresponds to Ptolemy’s &quot;Eboudai&quot;. Coates (2006) linked the names &quot;Uist&quot; and &quot;Ibiza&quot;, an island in the Mediterranean, arguing for an origin in Semitic &quot;*bšm&quot; (&quot;balsam&quot;) with the island-naming prefix &quot;*’y&quot;, acknowledging the possibility of a name transfer and the name being subject to the influence of Norse &quot;ívist&quot;.

==History==
=== Early history ===
South Uist was clearly home to a thriving Neolithic community. The island is covered in several neolithic remains, such as burial cairns, and a small number of standing stones, of which the largest—standing tall—is in the centre of the island, at the northern edge of Beinn A&#x27; Charra. Occupation continued into the Chalcolithic, as evidenced by a number of Beaker finds throughout the island.
Later in the Bronze Age, a man was mummified, and placed on display at Cladh Hallan, parts occasionally being replaced over the centuries; he was joined by a woman three hundred years later. Together they are the only known prehistoric mummies in the British Isles. Towards the end of the Bronze Age, the mummies were buried, and a row of roundhouses built on top of them.

Burials underneath buildings during this time are seen elsewhere on South Uist. At Hornish Point (&quot;Cnoc Mòr&quot;) a burial was found under a roundhouse, consisting of an individual, likely male and aged 12. The skeleton had been dismembered, probably some time after death when the body was partly decomposed. Cannibalism was ruled out as there were none of the marks of skinning, filleting and butchering which would be expected if it was cannibalism.
Cladh Hallan was not abandoned until the late Iron Age. At around that time, in the 2nd century BC, a broch was built at Dun Vulan; archeological investigation suggests the inhabitants often ate pork. After the 2nd century AD, the Dun Vulan broch was converted into a three-roomed house. At a similar time, a wheelhouse was constructed at Kilpheder; within a cupboard (in the wheelhouse) was found an enameled bronze brooch, of a style fashionable in the Roman Britain of 150 AD.

=== Kingdom of the Isles ===

In the 9th century, Vikings invaded South Uist, along with the rest of the Hebrides, and the gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata to the south, and established the Kingdom of the Isles throughout these lands. A short Ogham inscription has been found in Bornish, inscribed on a piece of animal bone, dating from this era; it is thought that the Vikings used it as a gaming token, or perhaps for sortilege.

Following Norwegian unification under King Harold Fairhair, the Kingdom of the Isles was declared a crown dependency by the Norwegian king; to the Norwegians it was &quot;Suðreyjar&quot; (meaning &quot;southern isles&quot;). Malcolm III of Scotland acknowledged in writing that Suðreyjar was under Norwegian control , and laterKing Edgar was forced toquitclaim in favour of the invaders. At Kilpheder, the roundhouses were abandoned in favour of Norse longhouses; at Bornish, a few miles to the north, a more substantial Norse settlement was built. As indicated by archaeological finds, residents had access to a wide trading network, stretching throughout the Norwegian empire, as well as adjacent lands like Ireland.
However, in the mid-12th century, Somerled, a Norse-Gael of uncertain origin, launched a coup, which made Suðreyjar independent of Norwegian domination. Following his death, Norwegian authority was nominally restored, but in practice the kingdom was divided between Somerled&#x27;s heirs (), and the dynasty that Somerled had deposed (the Crovan dynasty). The final return of Scotland&#x27;s territory was to follow. The MacRory, a branch of Somerled&#x27;s heirs, ruled Uist, as well as Barra, Eigg, Rùm, the Rough Bounds, Bute, Arran and northern Jura. A small monastery was established at Howmore.

=== Lordships ===
In the 13th century, despite Edgar&#x27;s quitclaim, Scottish forces attempted to restore parts of Suðreyjar to Scotland, culminating in the Battle of Largs. In 1266, the matter was settled by the Treaty of Perth, which acknowledged the whole of Suðreyjar to Scotland, in exchange for a compensatory sum of money. The Treaty expressly preserved the status of the rulers of Suðreyjar; the MacRory lands, excepting Bute, Arran, and Jura, became the &quot;Lordship of Garmoran&quot;, a quasi-independent crown dependency. Following this, the Norse longhouses were gradually abandoned, in favour of new Blackhouses and a new parish church was built at Howmore for South Uist.

At the turn of the century, William I had created the position of Sheriff of Inverness, to be responsible for the Scottish highlands, which now extended to Garmoran. In 1293, however, king John Balliol established the Sheriffdom of Skye, which included the Outer Hebrides. Nevertheless, following his usurpation, the Skye sheriffdom ceased to be mentioned, and the Garmoran lordship (including Uist) was confirmed to the MacRory leader. In 1343, King David II issued a further charter for this to the latter&#x27;s son.
Just three years later the sole surviving MacRory heir was Amy of Garmoran. The southern parts of the Kingdom of the Isles had become the &quot;Lordship of the Isles&quot;, ruled by the MacDonalds (another group of Somerled&#x27;s descendants). Amy married the MacDonald leader, John of Islay, but a decade later he divorced her, and married the king&#x27;s niece instead (in return for a substantial dowry). As part of the divorce, John deprived his eldest son, Ranald, of the ability to inherit the Lordship of the Isles, in favour of a son by his new wife. As compensation, John granted Lordship of Uist to Ranald&#x27;s younger brother Godfrey, while making Ranald Lord of the remainder of Garmoran.

However, on Ranald&#x27;s death, disputes between Godfrey and his nephews (the elder of whom founded Clan Ranald) led to an enormous amount of violent feuding. In 1427, frustrated with the level of violence in the Highlands, King James I demanded that Highland leaders should attend a meeting at Inverness. On arrival, many of the leaders were seized and imprisoned; Alexander MacGorrie, son of Godfrey, was considered to be one of the two most reprehensible, and after a quick show trial, was immediately executed. King James declared the Lordship of Uist forfeit.

===Fracture===
Following the forfeiture, and in that same year, the Lord of the Isles granted Lairdship of the southern third of South Uist (traditionally called &quot;Lochboisdale&quot;), together with Barra, to Giolla Adhamhnáin mac Néill, leader of the MacNeils. At around this time Calvay Castle was built, guarding Lochboisdale.
The remainder of South Uist remained with the Scottish crown until 1469, when James III granted Lairdship of it to John of Ross, the Lord of the Isles; in turn, John passed it to his own half-brother, Hugh of Sleat (the grant to Hugh was later confirmed by the king—James IV—in a 1493 charter). Hugh died a few years later, in 1498, and for reasons that are not remotely clear, his son—John of Sleat—immediately resigned, transferring all authority to the king.

On 3 August that same year, king James IV awarded the central third of South Uist (traditionally known as &quot;Kilpheder&quot;), by charter to Ranald Bane, leader of Clan Ranald. Two days later, the king gave Ranald Bane a charter for the northern third (traditionally known as &quot;Skirhough&quot;) as well. Ranald Bane, or his heirs, built Casteal Bheagram, on Loch an Eilean in Skirhough, as their local stronghold.

===John Moidartach and his sons===

Some time after Ranald Bane&#x27;s nephew, John Moidartach, succeeded as laird, he fell out of favour with King James V. By 1538, James had transferred lairdship of Kilpheder to John&#x27;s younger half-brother, Farquhar; the king gave him Skirhough shortly afterwards. In 1563, Farquhar sold his portion of South Uist to a distant relation, James MacDonald (heir of the second son of John of Islay); that same year, Mary, Queen of Scots, issued a charter confirming James MacDonald as laird of these lands.
In the following year, Farquhar was murdered by John Moidartach&#x27;s sons. The year after that, as opponents of the Scottish reformation, Moidartach and his family took the side of the Queen during the Chaseabout Raid, and were consequently back in royal favour; the Queen prohibited them from being punished for Farquhar&#x27;s murder. By the last decades of the century, John Moidartach had obtained a practical hold on Farquhar&#x27;s former lands, though seemingly as a tenant of James MacDonald&#x27;s heirs. In 1584 John died, and was buried at Howmore; a decorated stone from the site (the &quot;Clanranald Stone&quot;) is thought to have been his headstone.

In 1596, concerned by the active involvement of highland leaders in Irish rebellions against Queen Elizabeth of England, king James VI of Scotland (Elizabeth&#x27;s heir) demanded that they send well-armed men, as well as attending themselves, to meet him at Dumbarton on 1 August, and produce the charters for their land. As neither John Moidartach&#x27;s heirs, nor those of James MacDonald, did so, Skirhough and Kilpheder became forfeit, by the corresponding Act of Parliament. Consequently, the king awarded them to Donald Gorm Mòr, the heir of Hugh of Sleat, as a reward; he had been one of the few Highland leaders who obeyed the king&#x27;s summons. Donald Gorm Mòr subinfeudated Skirhough and Kilpheder back to Clan Ranald, for £46 per annum.

===Reunification===
The leader of the MacNeils did not submit to the 1609 Statutes of Iona. Using this as justification, Clan Ranald drove the MacNeils out of Lochboisdale, and were subsequently awarded a charter for it, in 1610. In 1622, Donald Gorm Mòr&#x27;s successor, Donald Gorm Òg, is found requesting that the Privy Council physically punish the Clan Ranald leadership for not removing their families and tenants from Skirhough; presumably they hadn&#x27;t been paying the rent. By way of settlement of the dispute, Donald Gorm Og was granted lairdship over Lochboisdale as well; thus Donald Gorm Og became laird of the whole of South Uist, while Clan Ranald held it as his feudal vassals.

In 1633, Donald Gorm Òg decided to simply sell lairdship of South Uist to the Earl of Argyll; in January 1634, this arrangement was confirmed by a crown charter. In 1661, as a leading opponent of king Charles I, the Earl&#x27;s son — the Marquess of Argyll — was convicted of high treason, and his lands became forfeit. Thus, in 1673, it was the king demanding that Clan Ranald pay their outstanding rent for South Uist.

===Debt, poverty and loss===
In 1701, Ailean Dearg MacDonald, the Chief of Clan MacDonald of Clanranald, built Ormaclete Castle as his new main residence in South Uist. According to local &quot;Seanchaidh&quot; Angus MacLellan, Ailean Dearg is said to have gone into considerable debt in order to build the castle and, according to the oral tradition, once played a prank that terrified his many creditors when they visited South Uist, which resulted in his debts all being cancelled and his credit restored.

In 1715, some venison caught fire in the kitchen, which led to the whole castle burning down. At the time, like many of the other Clan Donald leaders, Ailean Dearg was away fighting in the Jacobite rising of 1715. A few days after the fire, Ailean Dearg was fighting on the right wing of the Jacobite Army at the Battle of Sheriffmuir when he fell mortally wounded. Ailean Dearg was, according to John Lorne Campbell, &quot;killed, it was popularly said, by a silver bullet that negatived the charm he used to wear&quot;. Alasdair Dubh, 11th Chief of Clan MacDonald of Glengarry then managed to rally the faltering warriors of Clan Donald by throwing up his blue bonnet and crying () (&quot;Blows today, mourning tomorrow!&quot;). After these events, the Chiefs of Clan Ranald moved their main residence back to Benbecula.

During the time when the Chiefs of Clanranald were absentee landlords, the estate Factor lived, according to Angus MacLellan, in a house at Loch Eynort on a site still known as (), or &quot;The Rent House Point.&quot;

During the Jacobite rising of 1745, Ranald MacDonald, the son of the Clan Ranald leader, amassed large amounts of debt by funding the Jacobite army. In the following year, Bonnie Prince Charlie was able to hide at Calvay Castle, after fleeing from the Battle of Culloden, until he was able to escape with the aid of Flora MacDonald. Though an act of attainder (and forfeit) was subsequently passed against Ranald, it had no effect, due to accidentally naming him as &quot;Donald&quot; MacDonald.
Ranald&#x27;s debts proved burdensome for his family, but his grandson, Ranald George MacDonald, was able to keep them at bay thanks to the Napoleonic Wars; the wars had restricted the supply of certain minerals, turning the production of soda ash by burning kelp into a highly profitable activity. Kelp harvesting (and burning) became one of the principle economic activities of the population of South Uist, but when the wars ended, competition from imported barilla resulted in the kelp price collapsing. In 1837, facing bankruptcy, Ranald sold South Uist to Lt. Colonel John Gordon of Cluny.

Already accustomed to treating people as slaves, and seeing the financial advantages to livestock farming, Gordon was ruthless, evicting the population with short notice. On 11 August 1851, he demanded that everyone in South Uist attend a public meeting at Lochboisdale; according to an eyewitness, he dragged the attendees from the meeting, sometimes in handcuffs, and threw then onto waiting ships, like cattle. Having &quot;cleared&quot; much of the land, he replaced the population with flocks of Blackface sheep, bringing in Lowland farmers to care for them. The former population largely moved to Canada; the remaining populace of South Uist represented less than half of the 1841 total.

Meanwhile, as both Col. Gordon and his Factors considered the nearby island of Eriskay &quot;agriculturally worthless&quot;, accordingly used the island as a dumping ground for evicted tenants from his many other island estates throughout the southern Outer Hebrides. For the most part, however, the newly arrived islanders of Eriskay, which drastically multiplied the island&#x27;s population, belonged overwhelmingly to the once strictly illegal Catholic Church in Scotland and had their family roots across the Sound of Barra in South Uist.

=== Later history ===

Lochboisdale became a major herring port later in the 19th century. In 1889, counties were formally created in Scotland, on shrieval boundaries, by a dedicated Local Government Act; South Uist therefore became part of the new county of Inverness. Following late 20th-century reforms, South Uist became part of the Highland Region. The population level remained steady after the 19th-century clearances (in 2004 it was 2,285). Following a series of different landowners, South Uist was owned by South Uist Estates Ltd from 1960. In 2006, the local community bought all of the company&#x27;s shares, via the special purpose vehicle &quot;Sealladh na Beinne Mòire&quot;.

===MOD Hebrides===

In the north west of the island at (), a missile testing range was built in 1957–58 to launch the MGM-5 Corporal missile, Britain and America&#x27;s first guided nuclear weapon. This development went ahead despite significant protests, some locals expressing concern that the Scottish Gaelic language would not survive the influx of English-speaking Army personnel. The British Government claimed that there was an &#x27;overriding national interest&#x27; in establishing a training range for their newly purchased Corporal, a weapon that was to be at the front line of Cold War defence. The Corporal missile was tested from 1959 to 1963, before giving way to MGM-29 Sergeant and MGM-52 Lance tactical nuclear missiles. The &#x27;rocket range&#x27; as it is known locally has also been used to test high-altitude research rockets, Skua and Petrel. Local opposition to the range inspired the 1957 novel &quot;Rockets Galore&quot; by Compton Mackenzie, which was made into the film &quot;Rockets Galore!&quot;.

MOD Hebrides is still owned by the MoD operated by QinetiQ as a testing facility for missile systems such as the surface-to-air Rapier missile and unmanned aerial vehicles.

==Ownership of South Uist==
After a protracted campaign, South Uist residents took control of the island on 30 November 2006 in Scotland&#x27;s biggest community land buyout to date. The previous landowners, a sporting syndicate, sold the assets of the estate for £4.5 million to a Community Company known as &quot;Stòras Uibhist&quot;, which was set up to purchase the land and to manage it. The buyout resulted in most of South Uist, and neighbouring Benbecula, and all of Eriskay coming under community control. The proposal for community ownership received the overwhelming support of the people of the islands, who &quot;look forward to regenerating the local economy, reversing decline and depopulation, and reducing dependency, while remaining aware of the environmental needs, culture and history of the islands&quot;. The company claims its name—&quot;Stòras Uibhist&quot; (meaning &#x27;Uist Resource&#x27;)—symbolises hope for the future wealth and prosperity of the islands. The organisation&#x27;s website states that &quot;Stòras Uibhist&quot; comprises South Uist Estates Ltd, South Uist Renewable Energy (the wind farm) and Lochboisdale Development Limited (&quot;which is responsible for the newly built Marina in the port of Lochboisdale&quot;).

==Economy==

Tourism is important to the island&#x27;s economy and attractions include the Kildonan Museum, housing the 16th-century Clanranald Stone, and the ruins of the house where Flora MacDonald was born.

South Uist is home to the Askernish Golf Course. The oldest course in the Outer Hebrides, Askernish was designed by Old Tom Morris, who also worked on the Old Course at St Andrews. Morris was commissioned by Lady Gordon Cathcart in 1891. The Askernish course existed intact until the 1930s, but was partly destroyed to make way for an aircraft runway, then abandoned, and ultimately lost. Its identity remained hidden for many years before its apparent discovery, a claim disputed by some locals.
Restoration of the course to Morris&#x27;s original design was held up by disagreements with local crofters, but after legal challenges were resolved in the courts, the course opened in August 2008. The summer music school, Ceòlas, takes place every year from the first Sunday of July in Daliburgh School on the island. In 2019, it was estimated that the school contributed around £210,000 to the local economy. It is then followed by the local children&#x27;s summer school, Fèis Tir a&#x27;Mhurain.

The Explore South Uist Web site discusses attractions to tourists: Loch Druidibeg a National Nature Reserve, the Cladh Hallan Roundhouses archaeological site, Ormacleit Castle
(completed in 1708 and destroyed by fire in 1715), Uist Sculpture Trail &quot;of seven commissioned works by artists&quot;, the Statue of Our Lady of the Isles, the Askernish Golf Course, Flora MacDonald&#x27;s Monument, Kildonan Museum and Crafts and some Standing Stones. The community group owner of South Uist, the Stòras Uibhist, owns the Lochcarnan 6.9MW wind farm project which began operation in 2013. It is composed of three Enercon E-70 2.3MW turbines. In 2019, the operation required re-financing which was easily obtained. A spokesperson for Stòras Uibhist said that the wind farm is important because it &quot;generates income we can reinvest back into the communities ... to boost the economy, protect local crofting practices and generate employment opportunities&quot;.

==Wildlife and conservation==
The west coast of South Uist is home to the most extensive cultivated machair system in Scotland, which is protected as protected a both a Special Area of Conservation and a Special Protection Area under the Natura 2000 programme. Over 200 species of flowering plants have been recorded on the reserve, some of which are nationally scarce. South Uist is considered the best place in the UK for the aquatic plant Slender Naiad &quot;(Najas flexilis)&quot;, which is a European Protected Species. Nationally important populations of breeding waders are also present, including redshank, dunlin, lapwing and ringed plover. The island is also home to greylag geese on the lochs, and in summer corncrakes on the machair. Otters and hen harriers are also seen.

Loch Druidibeg in the north of the island was formerly (until 2012) a national nature reserve owned and managed by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH). The area, which is now protected as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, covers 1,675 hectares of machair, bog, freshwater lochs, estuary, heather moorland and hill. Ownership of the SSSI was transferred from SNH to the local community-owned company Stòras Uibhist.

An area of the south west coast of the island is designated as the &quot;South Uist Machair National Scenic Area&quot;, one of 40 such areas in Scotland which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and ensure its protection from inappropriate development. The designated area covers 13,314 ha in total, of which 6,289 ha is on land, with a further 7,025 ha being marine (i.e. below low tide level).

There has been considerable controversy over hedgehogs on South Uist. The animals are not native to the islands, having been introduced in the 1970s to reduce garden pests. It is claimed that they pose a threat to the eggs of ground-nesting wading birds on the island. In 2003 the Uist Wader Project — headed by Scottish Natural Heritage — began a cull of hedgehogs in the area. Following a campaign and concerns over animal welfare, this cull was called off in 2007; instead, hedgehogs are being captured and moved to mainland Scotland.

Along with the island&#x27;s situation on the North Atlantic Ocean, its machair is considered to be one of the most vulnerable coasts in Scotland due to relative sea level rise and the potential effects of climate change. Specifically, research has shown that the most vulnerable areas include Ìochdar, Stoneybridge, Cille Pheadair, and Orasay.

==Gaelic==
At the 2011 Census it was found that 1,888 Gaelic speakers live on South Uist and Benbecula, this being 60% of the two islands&#x27; population. &#x27;Na Meadhoinean&#x27;, Middle District in South Uist, is the strongest Gaelic-speaking community in the world, at 82%.

A local Gaelic folktale tells of how a seal came out of the sea to settle a boundary dispute between the communities of Lochboisdale and Kilpheder by showing the antagonists where the boundary line should lie.

==In Popular Culture==
The 1962 television series, The Dark Island, was filmed in South Uist.

<text>The WOMBLES (White Overalls Movement Building Libertarian Effective Struggles) were a loosely aligned anarchist and anti-capitalist group based in London. They gained prominence in the early 2000s for wearing white overalls with padding and helmets at May Day protests, mimicking the Italian group Tute Bianche.

== Beginnings ==
The WOMBLES formed as a group in the early 2000s in London. The name stood for White Overalls Movement Building Libertarian Effective Struggles. Activists who had witnessed first hand the tactics of the Tute Bianche in Italy decided to use similar methods of protest in London. Tute Bianche (&#x27;White Overalls&#x27;) had formed in 1994 and were known for storming barricades whilst dressed in comical padded outfits and helmets to protect themselves from police violence, as for example at the 27th G8 summit in Genoa.

The preferred tactic of the London anarchist group was to steal an estate agents &#x27;For Sale&#x27; sign, fold it up and wear it under the trademark white overalls. The WOMBLES were involved in protests during several May Day events in the early 2000s, including the protests in 2004 in Dublin.

== Social centres ==

The WOMBLES were also inspired by self-managed social centres in Italy and therefore began a series of social centres in London. Firstly, they squatted the Radical Dairy on Kynaston Road in Stoke Newington. This lasted from 2001 until 2003. The aim was to build long-term relationships with local people and to avoid capitalist property relations. From this centre, participants were then involved with other projects such as the Ex-Grand Banks, RampART, the Institute for Autonomy and The Square. The Button Factory squat in southeast London was evicted by police and partially demolished by the owner before the 2001 May Day demonstrations. The Ex-Grand Banks at 156-158 Fortess Road, in Tufnell Park, north London was opened on 4 March 2004. It became an activist hub before being evicted in August.

As well as organising in physical spaces, the WOMBLES used the internet to reach a wider audience, enabling solidarity networks.

The third European Social Forum (ESF) was held in London in 2004. The WOMBLES organised a countersummit held at Middlesex University called &#x27;Beyond ESF&#x27; which provided a space for European radical social movements to meet and engage, focusing primarily on the issue of precarity.

== In the media ==
The WOMBLES quickly became a personification of the anti-capitalist and anti-globalisation movements for the mainstream media of the United Kingdom. The &quot;Evening Standard&quot; decided to &#x27;infiltrate&#x27; the WOMBLES before the 2001, 2002 and 2003 Mayday protests in London. Individuals were identified as leaders and followed around by police and journalists at demonstrations.

Even after the WOMBLES had ceased to organise large scale demonstrations, the media continued to use their name as shorthand for a notorious group of anarchists. The WOMBLES were said to be organising against the G20 in 2009 according to the &quot;Mirror&quot;.

== In popular culture ==

The song Time for Heroes by the band Libertines reference the WOMBLES:

== Police infiltration ==

Between 1999 and 2010, the WOMBLES were infiltrated by at least three British police officers, namely Mark Kennedy, Rod Richardson and Jaqueline Anderson. Kennedy later apologised for his actions, saying &quot;I hate myself so much. I betrayed so many people. I owe it to a lot of good people to do something right for a change... I&#x27;m really sorry. If I can help in any way then I&#x27;d like to.&quot; Anderson was involved with the Radical Dairy and was known then as &#x27;Massage Jacky&#x27; since she offered massage sessions. She told other activists she lived in a flat with Carlo Neri, who was also later exposed as a police spy.

<text>Benbecula ( ; or ) is an island of the Outer Hebrides in the Atlantic Ocean off the west coast of Scotland. In the 2011 census, it had a resident population of 1,283 with a sizable percentage of Roman Catholics. It is in a zone administered by or the Western Isles Council. The island is about from west to east and a similar distance from north to south. It lies between the islands of North Uist and South Uist and is connected to both by road causeways. Benbecula&#x27;s main settlement and administrative centre is Balivanich (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Baile a&#x27; Mhanaich&quot;, meaning &quot;Town of the Monk&quot;).

In 1746, Bonnie Prince Charlie was caught in a storm and forced to land on Benbecula. The population of Benbecula were sympathetic to the Jacobite cause, and smuggled him off the island to safety, as the song has it: &quot;over the sea to Skye&quot;.

In 2006, local residents took control of parts of the island in a community buy-out. The previous landowners, a sporting syndicate, sold their estate, which included Benbecula, South Uist and Eriskay for £4.5 million to a community-owned organisation known as Stòras Uibhist, which now manages the land in perpetuity.

==Language==
===Etymology===
The first written record of the name is as &quot;Beanbeacla&quot; in 1449. The names and are used in Scottish Gaelic today. All these names are assumed to derive from &quot;Peighinn nam Fadhla&quot; (pronounced ) &quot;pennyland of the fords&quot; as the island is low-lying. &quot;Peighinn&quot; is very similar phonetically to the unstressed form of &quot;Beinn&quot; ( &quot;mountain&quot;, and appears to have been subject to folk etymology or re-analysis, leading to the modern forms containing &quot;Beinn&quot; rather than &quot;Peighinn&quot;. Through a process of language assimilation, the sequence has resulted in the modern pronunciation of . The spelling variations &quot;faola&quot; and &quot;fadhla&quot; are due to phonetic merger of with in certain Gaelic dialects. Spelling variants include: &quot;Beinn a&#x27; Bhaoghla&quot;, &quot;Beinn na bhFadhla&quot; and &quot;Beinn nam Faola&quot;.

The second element is a loan from Norse &quot;vaðil(l)&quot; &quot;ford&quot; which was borrowed as Gaelic &quot;fadhail&quot; (genitive &quot;fadhla&quot;). Through the process of reverse lenition &quot;fadhla&quot;, with the ethnonymic suffix &quot;-ach&quot; has led to the formation of &quot;Badhlach&quot; &quot;a person from Benbecula&quot;.

Other interpretations that have been suggested over the years are &quot;Beinn Bheag a&#x27; bhFaodhla&quot;, supposedly meaning the &quot;little mountain of the ford&quot;, &quot;Beinn a&#x27; Bhuachaille&quot;, meaning &quot;the herdsman&#x27;s mountain&quot; and from , meaning &quot;bare hill&quot;.

The island is also known in Gaelic poetry as &quot;An t-Eilean Dorcha&quot; &quot;the dark island&quot;.
===Current language use===
Benbecula has historically been a very strong Gaelic-speaking area. In both the 1901 and the 1921 censuses, all parishes were reported to be over 75% Gaelic-speaking. By 1971, Benbecula and South Uist were classed as 50–74% Gaelic-speaking.

It remains a relatively strong Gaelic-speaking area in spite of a continued decline. In the 2001 census, Benbecula overall had 56% Gaelic speakers. The weakest Gaelic-speaking area is Balivanich, with only 37%. All other areas on Benbecula range between 74% (Lionacleit) and 62% (Gramsdale and Uachdar).

== Geology ==
In common with the rest of the Western Isles, Benbecula is formed from the oldest rocks in Britain, the Lewisian gneiss which dates from the Archaean eon. Some around Ruabhal is described as Scourian gneiss of ortho-amphibolite composition. The direction of inclination of layered textures or foliation in this metamorphic rock varies across the island. Pseudotachylites are developed in certain areas whilst dykes and metasediments are noted at various localities.
The island is traversed by numerous normal faults most of which run broadly NW-SE though others run NNW-SSE. The Outer Hebrides Thrust, a legacy of the Caledonian orogeny, lies just off the eastern coast of the island and is seen on neighbouring Wiay and Marigaidh. Recent geological deposits include blown sand which is found around Balivanich and the airport and peat which though widespread in pockets, is found in larger quantities in the centre of the island.

==Geography==
The island is about from west to east and a similar distance from north to south. It lies between the islands of North Uist and South Uist; it is connected to both by road causeways. Travel to any of the other Hebridean islands, or to the British mainland, is by air or sea. Benbecula Airport on the island has daily flights to Glasgow, Stornoway and Barra. A direct service to Inverness was introduced in 2006 but discontinued in May 2007. There are no direct ferry services from Benbecula to the mainland, but a service operated by Caledonian MacBrayne from Lochboisdale on South Uist provides a five-hour crossing to Oban on the mainland, whilst another service from Lochmaddy on North Uist provides a two-hour crossing to Uig on the Inner Hebridean island of Skye, and hence to the mainland via the Skye Bridge. Ferry services from the islands of Berneray (linked by causeway to North Uist) and Eriskay (linked to South Uist) connect to the other Outer Hebridean islands of Harris and Barra respectively.

There is a dense cluster of lochs across almost the entire island, and almost the whole island is below in elevation.

===Climate===
Benbecula has an extremely moderated temperate oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb &quot;), due to its island location. The nearest station to Benbecula is now South Uist, away. However, a long-standing weather station used to report directly from Benbecula, where the highest temperature ever reported in the Western Isles was recorded at on 30 July 1948.
===Settlements===
Benbecula&#x27;s main settlement is Balivanich (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Baile a&#x27; Mhanaich&quot;, meaning &quot;Town of the Monk&quot;) in the northwest. It is the main administrative centre for Benbecula, North Uist, South Uist and nearby islands, and has the council offices and the administrative centre for MOD Hebrides on South Uist, which is managed by QinetiQ. The village is also home to the airport and the island&#x27;s bank.

Other settlements include Craigstrome, a tiny hamlet in the south-east of Benbecula. In contrast to the cultivated west coast of the island, the eastern half is a mixture of freshwater lochs, moorland, bog and deeply indenting sea lochs. Craigstrome is near Ruabhal, Benbecula&#x27;s highest hill at .

The township of Lionacleit houses the island&#x27;s main secondary school, which also doubles as a community centre, with a swimming pool, cafeteria, sports facilities, a small museum and a library. Next door to this is the Lionacleit campus of Lews Castle College. Lionacleit lies on the west coast road, about from its junction with the north–south spinal road near Creagorry.

Creagorry is in the south of the island, near the causeway to South Uist. The Co-op here is the main supermarket for the south of the island and for the north of South Uist. Borve Castle is near Lionacleit.

The RAF radar station RRH Benbecula monitors the northern Atlantic, but is located on the west coast of North Uist.

===Nearby islands===

In addition to South and North Uist, there are numerous islands off the north, east and south coasts. To the north of Balivanich is Baleshare, and further east is Flodaigh, which is connected to Benbecula by another causeway. Beyond Flodaigh are Grimsay and Ronay. Off the east coast there are numerous small islands in Loch Uisgebhagh and beyond, including Bearran and Orasaigh Uisgeabhagh. Eileanan Chearabhaigh in the south east have a total area of spread over several islands, the largest of which is about in extent. Further south is the larger Wiay and west from there a profusion of skerries and small islands lie to the north of Bagh nam Faoileann. These include Fraoch-eilean, a second Grimsay, Fodragaigh, Eilean na Cille and Triallabreac.

==History==
===Early history===
A number of standing stones from the Neolithic period are scattered throughout the island, including the remains of a stone circle at Rubha Bhidein, adjacent to the traditional ford to Grimsay. In addition to these, the remains of two chambered cairns lie between Loch Ba Una, and Loch nan Clachan. A Beaker site has been identified a Rossinish.
The island is rich in built remains from the Iron Age, though they are generally in poor condition. A number of small island forts can be found throughout Benbecula, particularly on Loch Olabhat, but the most substantial is Dun Buidhe, near Balivanich, which has a series of causeways linking it to the loch shore, via Eilean Dubh (&quot;Black Island&quot;); a wheelhouse was also present nearby (a better preserved wheelhouse survives on the adjacent island of Grimsay), at which Iron Age pottery was found.

At the shore near Dun Buidhne was found a Class 1 Pictish symbol stone, inscribed with two basic symbols one of the only indications anywhere in the Outer Hebrides that Picts had been present. Traditional accounts claim that Ternan, an Irish missionary of the late 5th/early 6th century, established a chapel to the south of Dun Buidhe, from which he sought to convert the Picts to Christianity; Balivanich takes its name from this supposed establishment.

===Kingdom===

In the 9th century viking settlers established the Kingdom of the Isles throughout the Hebrides. Nevertheless, although evidence of viking settlement has been found in both North and South Uist, there has not yet been found any sign of viking settlement on Benbecula itself. Following Norwegian unification, the Kingdom of the Isles became a crown dependency of the Norwegian king; to the Norwegians the Kingdom was &quot;Suðreyjar&quot; (meaning &quot;southern isles&quot;). Malcolm III of Scotland acknowledged in writing that Suðreyjar was not Scottish, and king Edgar quitclaimed any residual doubts.

However, in the mid 12th century, Somerled, a Norse-Gael of uncertain origin, launched a coup, which made Suðreyjar entirely independent. Following his death, Norwegian authority was nominally restored, but in practice the kingdom was divided between Somerled&#x27;s heirs (), and the dynasty that Somerled had deposed (the Crovan dynasty). The MacRory, a branch of Somerled&#x27;s heirs, ruled Benbecula, as well as Uist, Barra, Eigg, Rùm, the Rough Bounds, Bute, Arran, and northern Jura.

In the 13th century, despite Edgar&#x27;s quitclaim, Scottish forces attempted to conquer parts of Suðreyjar, culminating in the indecisive Battle of Largs. In 1266, the matter was settled by the Treaty of Perth, which transferred the whole of Suðreyjar to Scotland, in exchange for a very large sum of money. The treaty expressly preserved the status of the rulers of Suðreyjar; the MacRory lands, excepting Bute, Arran, and Jura, became the &quot;Lordship of Garmoran&quot;, a quasi-independent crown dependency, rather than an intrinsic part of Scotland.

===Lordship===
At the turn of the century, William I had created the position of Sheriff of Inverness, to be responsible for the Scottish highlands, which theoretically now extended to Garmoran. In 1293, however, king John Balliol established the Sheriffdom of Skye, which included the Outer Hebrides. Nevertheless, following his usurpation, the Skye sheriffdom ceased to be mentioned, and the Garmoran lordship (including Uist) was confirmed to the MacRury leader. In 1343, King David II issued a further charter for this to the latter&#x27;s son.
Just three years later the sole surviving MacRury heir was Amy of Garmoran. According to MacGibbon and Ross, Borve Castle (which they date to between 1344 and 1363) was built by Amy; it became the main power seat of power in Benbecula and surrounding islands of North and South Uist. Amy is also reported to have built &quot;the parish church of St. Columba on Benbecula&quot;; the eastern side of Teampul Chalumchille, an ancient chapel dedicated to St Columba, dates to her lifetime.

The southern parts of the Kingdom of the Isles had become the &quot;Lordship of the Isles&quot;, ruled by the MacDonalds (another group of Somerled&#x27;s descendants). Amy married the MacDonald leader, John of Islay, but a decade later he divorced her, and married the king&#x27;s niece instead (in return for a substantial dowry). As part of the divorce, John deprived his eldest son, Ranald, of the ability to inherit the Lordship of the Isles, in favour of a son by his new wife. As compensation, John granted Lordship of North Uist and South Uist (presumably including Benbecula) to Ranald&#x27;s younger brother Godfrey, and made Ranald Lord of the remainder of Garmoran.

However, on Ranald&#x27;s death, his sons were still children, and Godfrey took the opportunity to seize the Lordship of Garmoran. This led to a great deal of violent conflict involving Godfrey&#x27;s family (the Siol Gorrie) and the heirs of Ranald (Clan Ranald) and his other brother Murdoch (the Siol Murdoch). In 1427, frustrated with the level of violence generally in the highlands, King James I demanded that highland magnates should attend a meeting at Inverness. On arrival, many of the leaders were seized and imprisoned. Alexander MacGorrie, son of Godfrey, was considered to be one of the two most reprehensible, and after a quick showtrial, was immediately executed. As Alexander had by now inherited Godfrey&#x27;s de facto position as Lord of Garmoran, and in view of Ranald&#x27;s heirs being no less responsible for the violence, King James declared the Lordship forfeit.

===Lairdship===

Following the forfeiture, most of Garmoran (including Benbecula) remained with the Scottish crown until 1469, when James III granted Lairdship of it to John of Ross, the Lord of the Isles. In turn, John passed it to his own half-brother, Hugh of Sleat; the grant to Hugh was confirmed by the king – James IV – in a 1493 charter.

Hugh died a few years later, in 1498, and for reasons that are not remotely clear, his son John of Sleat immediately resigned, transferring all authority to the king. That same year, king James IV awarded Benbecula to Angus &quot;Reochson&quot;, son of Ranald&#x27;s penultimate son, Angus &quot;Riabhach&quot;. Angus&#x27; son, Angus &quot;MacAngus Rewing&quot;, became a friar at Iona, and was succeeded by his son John. John died in 1538, without any lawful children; under the charter, this demise of Angus Riabhach&#x27;s line meant that ownership of Benbecula returned to the King.

In 1538, therefore, the king granted lairdship of Benbecula to Allan and Lachlan MacDonald (jointly), the grandsons of Ranald Bane. Ordinarily, Allan would have been the head of Clan Ranald, but the extreme cruelty of his father, Dougall, led to Ranald Bane&#x27;s descendants being officially barred from the succession; instead leadership of the Clan now rested with Ranald Bane&#x27;s nephew, John Moidartach.

In 1549, Donald Monro, Dean of the Isles wrote of the &quot;south part of Ywst&quot; and went on:
and in the north syde of this there is ane parochin callit Buchagla, perteining to the said Clandonald. At the north end thereof the sea cuts the countrey againe, and that cutting of the sea is called Careynesse, and benorth this countrey is called Kenehnache of Ywst, that is in Englishe, the north head of Ywst.
===Tenancy===
In 1596, concerned by the active involvement of Highland leaders in Irish rebellions against Queen Elizabeth of England, King James VI of Scotland (Elizabeth&#x27;s heir) demanded that Highland leaders send well-armed men, as well as attending themselves, to meet him at Dumbarton on 1 August, and produce the charters for their land. As Allan&#x27;s heirs did not do so, Benbecula became forfeit, by Act of Parliament. The king then awarded Benbecula to Donald Gorm Mor, the heir of Hugh of Sleat, as a reward for being one of the few Highland leaders who had obeyed the king&#x27;s summons.

Donald Gorm Mor subinfeudated Benbecula to Clan Ranald for £46 per annum. In 1622, however, his successor, Donald Gorm Og, is found requesting that the Privy Council physically punish the Clan Ranald leadership for not removing their families and tenants from Benbecula; presumably they had not been paying the rent.

In 1633, Donald Gorm Og decided to sell the lairdship of Benbecula to the Earl of Argyll; in January 1634, this arrangement was confirmed by a Crown charter. In 1661, as a leading opponent of king Charles I, the Earl&#x27;s son – the Marquess of Argyll – was convicted of high treason, and his lands became forfeit. Thus, in 1673, it was the king demanding that Clan Ranald pay their outstanding rent for Benbecula.
===Refuge===
In 1746, Flora MacDonald was the chief of Clan Ranald during the feudal wards. She was a distant relative of two of the companions of Bonnie Prince Charlie (Prince Charles Edward Stuart), who had recently fled in the aftermath of the Battle of Culloden. During his voyage, the Prince&#x27;s boat was caught in a storm, and he was forced to land on Benbecula. Despite mainly being Presbyterian, Flora and the population of Benbecula were sympathetic to the Jacobite cause, and the Prince and his companions received hospitable treatment. Nevertheless, the Prince was a fugitive with a price on his head, and his companions therefore sought out Flora. She disguised him as an Irish spinning maid, &quot;Betty Burke&quot;, and by this means smuggled him off the island, on 27 June, and took him &quot;over the sea to Skye&quot;. Flora was arrested upon her return to Scotland, but was released following the Indemnity Act 1747. Later, she explained in person to the King&#x27;s son, Prince Frederick, that she had only acted out of charity, and would have done the same for either side.

===Eviction===

In the early 19th century, the leader of Clan Ranald, Ranald George MacDonald, got into severe financial difficulties. The family trust forbade him from even visiting Benbecula. His difficulties were compounded by the enormous debts which had been amassed by his grandfather, in support of Jacobite armies. In 1838, forced to sell his lands, Ranald sold them to Colonel John Gorden of Cluny.

Already accustomed to treating people as slaves, and seeing the financial advantages to livestock farming, Gordon was ruthless, evicting the population with short notice, sometimes even resorting to dragging them to the shore in handcuffs, wearing little more than their undergarments. He replaced the residents with sheep. Despite his behaviour causing a national outcry, it was continued by the widow of his son, well into the early 20th century.

==Modern island life==

In 2001 the census recorded a population of 1,219 the 2011 total of 1,303 being an increase of 7% against an average of 3% for all Scottish islands.

A contributor to the economy is RRH Benbecula. The site near Balvanich also includes Benbecula Airport, with regular flights to Glasgow, Inverness, and Stornoway.

===Community buy-out===
After a protracted campaign, local residents took control of parts of the island on 30 November 2006 in a community buy-out. The previous landowners, a sporting syndicate, sold the assets of the estate including Benbecula, South Uist and Eriskay for £4.5 million to a community-owned organisation known as Stòras Uibhist which was set up to purchase the land and to manage it in perpetuity.

==Mythology==

A local myth states that a mermaid, discovered in 1830, is reportedly buried near the sea on Benbecula.

<doc id="143573" wikidata="Q5643091" url="?curid=143573" title="Halloween 2002 anti-war protest">
<text>On the 31 October 2002 a series of anti-war and anti-capitalist protests, generally focusing on the planned war on Iraq took place across the UK and the United States.

There is some dispute over who called and built the UK protests, the Stop the War Coalition attempted to co-opt the protests which were actually the results of work by various activists from differing socialist and anarchist strains and not just one campaign.

==United Kingdom==
The first of the protests took place during the morning rush hour at the Menai Suspension Bridge between Anglesey and Wales blocking the traffic.

In London people dressed as ghosts marched on the Parliament of the United Kingdom and succeeded in projecting &quot;No war on Iraq&quot; on the Palace of Westminster, and took part in &quot;direct action&quot; against those corporations whom they perceived as likely to benefit from the war in Iraq.

According to the UK Independent Media Centre, &quot;[a]round 150 different events included critical mass bike rides, occupations, and mass demonstrations in Brighton, Manchester, Glasgow and London and many other places.&quot; and &quot; University occupations also took place at Manchester, Sheffield, Cambridge, Colchester Sixth Form, Brighton, SOAS and UCL and the LSE in London.&quot;

==United States==
Protests in the US were against both the planned invasion of Iraq issue and the Free Trade Area of the Americas agreement then under negotiation.

==Disobedients==
Disobedients was a network set up to protest the upcoming War on Iraq during 2002 and early 2003. It was a loose knit group of grass roots activists adopting the PGA hallmarks.

Protests it organised included the Halloween 2002 anti-war protest in London, and the Old Street Roundabout protest that occurred the day after the War in Iraq started.

<text>Barra (; or ; ) is an island in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland, and the second southernmost inhabited island there, after the adjacent island of Vatersay to which it is connected by the Vatersay Causeway.

In 2011, the population was 1,174. English and Gaelic are widely spoken, and at the 2011 Census, there were 761 Gaelic speakers (62% of the population, falling from 76% in the 1991 census).

== Geology ==
In common with the rest of the Western Isles, Barra is formed from the oldest rocks in Britain, the Lewisian gneiss, which dates from the Archaean eon. Some of the gneiss in the east of the island is noted as being pyroxene-bearing. Layered textures or foliation in this metamorphic rock is typically around 30° to the east or northeast. Palaeoproterozoic age metadiorites and metatonalites forming a part of the East Barra Meta-igneous Complex occur around Castlebay as they do on the neighbouring islands of Vatersay and Flodday. A few metabasic dykes intrude the gneiss in the east.
The island is traversed by a handful of normal faults running WNW-ESE and by west-facing thrust faults bringing nappes of gneiss from the east. Blown sand masks the bedrock around Borve and Allisdale as it does west of Barra airport. Peat deposits are mapped across Beinn Chliaid and Beinn Sgurabhal in the north of the island.

== History ==
===Early history===
Human presence on Barra since the Neolithic era was established by the discovery of a near-complete pottery beaker dating from 2500 BC during the construction of a road in the 1990s. A number of stone remains were also found, including a neolithic &quot;work platform&quot;, which complement the several standing stones scattered around the island. In the hills to the north of Borve, there is a large chambered cairn, sited in a prominent position.

Beyond the main island, a Bronze Age cemetery is located on Vatersay, as well as an Iron Age broch; the remains of a similarly aged broch is located on the east of Barra itself. Remains of Bronze Age burials and Iron Age roundhouses were also discovered in sand dunes, near the hamlet of Allasdale, following storms in 2007. Occupation of Barra continued during the later Iron Age, as evidenced by the discovery of a wheelhouse from the end of the period, which was later re-occupied between the 3rd and 4th centuries, and again in the 7th and 8th centuries.

These occupations were followed in the 9th century by Viking settlers, who gave the island the Old Norse &#x27; (&quot;island&quot;) part of its name. Various origins of &quot;Barr&quot; have been suggested, including the Gaelic personal name &#x27;, the Old Norse elements &#x27; or &#x27; (&quot;bare&quot; or &quot;rough&quot;), and the Celtic element *&quot;barr&quot; (&quot;top&quot; or &quot;peak&quot;). According to the ancient Grettis saga, the first viking to arrive was named &quot;Omund the Wooden-Leg&quot;.

===Kingdom of the Isles===
The Vikings established the Kingdom of the Isles throughout the Hebrides, including Barra. Following Norwegian unification, the Kingdom of the Isles became a crown dependency of the Norwegian king; to the Norwegians, it was &quot;Suðreyjar&quot; (meaning &quot;southern isles&quot;). Malcolm III of Scotland acknowledged in writing that they were not Scottish, and King Edgar quitclaimed any residual doubts. In the north of Barra, from this period survived a gravestone, on which a Celtic cross is present on one side, and runic inscriptions on the other.

In the mid 12th century, Somerled, a Norse-Gael of uncertain origin, launched a coup, which made Suðreyjar entirely independent. Following his death, Norwegian authority was nominally restored, but in practice, the kingdom was divided between Somerled&#x27;s heirs (), and the dynasty that Somerled had deposed (the Crovan dynasty). , a branch of Somerled&#x27;s heirs, ruled Barra, as well as Uist, Eigg, Rùm, the Rough Bounds, Bute, Arran, and northern Jura.

In the 13th century, despite Edgar&#x27;s quitclaim, Scottish forces attempted to conquer parts of Suðreyjar, culminating in the indecisive Battle of Largs. In 1266, the matter was settled by the Treaty of Perth, which transferred the whole of Suðreyjar to Scotland, in exchange for a very large sum of money. The Treaty expressly preserved the status of the rulers of Suðreyjar; the Clann Ruaidhri lands, excepting Bute, Arran, and Jura, became the &quot;Lordship of Garmoran&quot;, a quasi-independent crown dependency, rather than an intrinsic part of Scotland.

===Lordship of Garmoran===

In 1293, King John Balliol established the Sheriffdom of Skye, which included the Outer Hebrides. Following his usurpation, the sheriffdom ceased to be mentioned, and the Garmoran lordship (including Barra) was confirmed to , the head of Clann Ruaidhri. In 1343, King David II issued a further charter to Ruaidhrí&#x27;s son, Raghnall, but Raghnall&#x27;s assassination, just three years later, left Garmoran in the hands of Amy of Garmoran.

The southern parts of the Kingdom of the Isles had become the &quot;Lordship of the Isles&quot;, ruled by the MacDonalds (another group of Somerled&#x27;s descendants). Amy married the MacDonald leader, John of Islay, but a decade later he divorced her, and married the king&#x27;s niece instead (in return for a substantial dowry). As part of the divorce, John deprived his eldest son, Ranald, of the ability to inherit the Lordship of the Isles, in favour of a son by his new wife. As compensation, John granted Lordship of the Uists to Ranald&#x27;s younger brother Godfrey and made Ranald Lord of the remainder of Garmoran.

On Ranald&#x27;s death, disputes between Godfrey and his nephews led to an enormous amount of violence. In 1427, frustrated with the level of violence generally in the highlands, King James I demanded that highland leaders should attend a meeting at Inverness. On arrival, many of the leaders were seized and imprisoned; Alexander MacGorrie, son of Godfrey, was considered to be one of the two most reprehensible, and after a quick showtrial, was immediately executed. As Alexander had by now inherited Godfrey&#x27;s de facto position as Lord of Garmoran, and in view of Ranald&#x27;s heirs being no less responsible for the violence, King James declared the Lordship of Garmoran forfeit.

===Lairds and pirates===

Following the forfeiture, and in that same year, the Lord of the Isles granted Lairdship of Barra (and half of South Uist) to Giolla Adhamhnáin Mac Néill, Chief of Clan MacNeil.

Headquartering themselves at Kisimul Castle and making use of Birlinns, the MacNeils became famed for piracy after attacking English ships during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. They were summoned by King James VI – King of Scotland – to answer for their behaviour. The Chief, Roderick MacNeil (&quot;Rory the Turbulent&quot;), argued that he thought King James would be pleased, since Queen Elizabeth had beheaded his mother Mary, Queen of Scots. Pleased, King James released him. 

The mainly Catholic population of the island was under serious threat during the Jacobite Uprising of 1745. According to Bishop John Geddes, &quot;Early in the spring of 1746, some ships of war came to the coast of the isle of Barra and landed some men, who threatened they would lay desolate the whole island if the priest was not delivered up to them. Father 
James Grant, who was missionary then, and afterward Bishop, being informed of the threats in a safe retreat in which he was in a little island, surrendered himself, and was carried prisoner to Mingarry Castle on the Western coast (i.e. Ardnamurchan) where he was detained for some weeks.&quot;

After long imprisonment at Inverness and in a prison hulk in the River Thames, Father Grant was deported to the Netherlands and warned never to return to the British Isles. Like the other priests imprisoned with him, Father Grant did so almost immediately.
The descendants of the Clan Chiefs held on to Barra until 1838, when the island was sold to Colonel John Gordon of Cluny (for the sum of £38,050). Roderick MacNeil, Chief of the MacNeils, had already abandoned Kisimul Castle, and built a mansion in the north of Barra; the ensuing debt was one of the reasons he sold the island.

In common with many of the new Anglo-Scottish landlords, Colonel Gordon evicted most of the islanders to make way for sheep farming. Some of the displaced islanders variously went to the Scottish mainland. Others joined the Scottish diaspora in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Canada.

Gaelic traditional singer and Barra native Flora MacNeil later recalled one the best sources of the Gaelic songs she learned at local ceilidhs was her mother&#x27;s cousin, Mary Johnstone. Johnstone&#x27;s parents had moved to Mingulay after being evicted by Colonel Gordon&#x27;s factors and she returned to her ancestral island after Mingulay was abandoned in 1912. In later years, Johnstone would regularly visit the MacNeil family&#x27;s croft near Castlebay and sing at the ceilidhs.

By far the worst mass evictions took place, according to Barra &quot;seanchaidh&quot; (historian) John &quot;The Coddy&quot; MacPherson, during the Highland Potato Famine of the 1840s. Many residents of Barra were unwillingly rounded up and forced by Colonel Gordon&#x27;s factors to board the &quot;Admiral&quot;, an immigrant ship anchored at Lochboisdale, South Uist, and which then set sail for Canada.

MacPherson later said of those who were evicted, &quot;Now they were aboard, and they sailed away and it took them six months, I think, to get across from Lochboisdale to Quebec - or the St. Lawrence somewhere anyway. After that, there was nothing for them but trees and poverty, and those wretched fellows had to back it for life. Going through the hardships of the emigrants who went across the Atlantic in the &quot;Admiral&quot;, not many people would credit them today.&quot;

The MacNeil Chiefs were also among the migrants, settling at first in Canada, but moving to the United States by the 20th century. Barra was restored to MacNeil ownership in 1937 when the Barra estate, which encompassed most of the island, was bought by Robert Lister Macneil, an American. In 2000, his heir, Ian Roderick Macneil (another American), let Kisimul Castle to Historic Scotland, on a 1000-year lease (for a rental of £1 and a bottle of whisky, per annum). In 2003, he transferred ownership of the Barra Estate to the Scottish Government;. Under Scottish law, the inhabitants have the right to take possession of the estate themselves, if they so wish.

Having been flown unofficially for at least a decade, the island&#x27;s flag received official recognition from the Lyon Court and the Flag Institute in November 2017. The design is a white Nordic cross on a green background.

==Places of interest==
The main village is Castlebay (&quot;&quot;) in a sheltered bay, where Kisimul Castle sits on a small islet not far from shore; giving the village its name. This is the main harbour.

A smaller medieval tower house, , is in the middle of Loch St Clare on the west side of the island at Tangasdale.

The highest elevation on the island is Heaval, near the top of which is a prominent white marble statue of the Madonna and Child, called &quot;Our Lady of the Sea&quot;, which was erected during the Marian year of 1954. The predominant faith on the island is Catholicism and the Catholic church dedicated to Our Lady of the Sea is apparent to those arriving at Castlebay.

== Economy ==
Tourism provides the main income for the majority of islanders; the high season lasts from May to September. Thousands of people visit the island every year, the busiest times being during &amp; BarraFest in July. The Heritage and Cultural Centre is located in Castlebay, next to Castlebay Community School. It has various exhibitions each year and is open throughout the year. In April 2020, Condé Nast Traveller summed up Barra as &quot;a delightful little island with its own castle and beach airport&quot; and recommended visiting the &quot;high cliffs in the east and lovely beaches and bays in the west&quot;.

The Outer Hebrides Web site particularly recommended visits to sites &quot;the iconic Kisimul Castle at Castlebay&quot; and stopping to see the Barra seals at Seal Bay. The Explore Scotland tourism Web site also discusses the Barra Golf Club, Kisimul Castle, Barra Heritage and Cultural Centre, Heaval for exceptional views, Church of Our Lady Star of the Sea and Cille Bharra, the ancient graveyard.

According to the Scottish Government, &quot;tourism is by far and away the mainstay industry&quot; of the Outer Hebrides, &quot;generating £65m in economic value for the islands, sustaining around 1000 jobs&quot; The report adds that the &quot;islands receive 219,000 visitors per year&quot;. The Outer Hebrides tourism bureau states that 10–15% of economic activity on the islands was made up of tourism in 2017. The agency states that the &quot;exact split between islands is not possible&quot; when calculating the number of visits, but &quot;the approximate split is Lewis (45%), Uist (25%), Harris (20%), Barra (10%)&quot;.

Castlebay is the primary base for tourists, with a few hotels, a supermarket, bank and petrol station. Explore Scotland stated in 2020 that the island was &quot;also an ideal starting point for visiting and exploring the Uists and Benbecula&quot;.

In 2010, camping on the machair at the airport was banned due to erosion; this prompted crofters to provide areas on their crofts for visiting tourists. Boat trips to the neighbouring island of Mingulay are available during the summer season, and island-hopping plane trips are also available.

The Barratlantic factory, in Northbay is a fish and shellfish processing company. As of 2020, its main products were king scallops and langoustines but it was selling most types of white fish from the quayside. Their Web site indicated that the stock included &quot;cod; haddock; skate; witches; megrims; turbot; Dover sole and monkfish which you can buy direct from the factory&quot;. The Hebridean Toffee Factory in Castlebay is one of the few manufacturers on Barra and it makes the products locally. According to Visit Scotland, the toffee can be ordered from anywhere in the world; &quot;it is made to order and is usually shipped within 24 hours&quot;.

Isle of Barra Distillers was founded by Michael and Katie Morrison in 2016; their Barra Atlantic Gin was first sold in August 2017 and the company has expanded since then. As of early 2021, the distillery continued marketing gin, with great success. The plan for whisky was stated on its Web site as: &quot;It is our goal to open the Islands first Single Malt Whisky Distillery within the next 2-3 years&quot;.

The Isle of Barra distillery was founded in 2003 as Uisge Beatha nan Eilean Ltd and became a Community Benefit Society in 2018 under the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014. In December 2012, four 6 kW wind turbines made by Proven (Proven were bought by Kingspan Group in 2011) were erected next to the reservoir Loch Uisge, which originally supplied the mains water to Castlebay. It is proposed that as much as possible of the raw materials, supply chain and labor to produce the whisky should remain as local as possible to minimise imports and maximise the benefit to the island&#x27;s economy.

== Media ==
The island has featured in a variety of .

===Film and TV===
Barra is home to a TV production company, Little Day Productions, who produced the documentary &quot;Barra to Barcelona&quot;, which was broadcast on BBC Alba in 2022 and 2023. Much of their work features Barra and Vatersay.

Besides being regularly featured in various television programmes on the Scottish Gaelic channel BBC Alba since it began broadcasting in 2008, Barra has also been part of:

The 1949 Ealing Studios comedy &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot; was filmed on Barra. The film is based on the novel &quot;Whisky Galore&quot; by Sir Compton Mackenzie, itself a fictionalised telling of the story of the SS &quot;Politician&quot;, which ran aground with a cargo of some 50,000 cases of whisky on board in 1941. Mackenzie, who lived near the airport and died in 1972, is buried in a grave marked by a simple cross at cemetery, which is situated a little way up the hillside overlooking Eoligarry jetty. The sequel &quot;Rockets Galore!&quot; was also filmed in and around the island.

The sitcom &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, broadcast from 1968 to 1977, Private Frazer claims to be from Barra, which he often describes as &quot;a wild and lonely place&quot;.

Barra was featured on &quot;Time Team&quot;, in which archeologists excavated several Iron Age sites.

Barra was also featured in the 2006 Channel 5 documentary &quot;Extraordinary People: The Boy Who Lived Before&quot;, where a young boy named Cameron, who lived in Glasgow, claimed to have memories of past life on the island.

The island was the location for the fifth (2011) and sixth series (2012) of the BBC Two documentary &quot;An Island Parish&quot; documenting the arrival and subsequent experiences of a new Catholic priest on the island – Father John Paul.

===Books===
The Franciscan priest, specialist in mystical theology and author Rayner Torkington wrote a book describing how he was influenced after a chance encounter on Barra by meeting a hermit called Peter Calvay who had lived on the island of Hellisay for a number of years in the first half of the twentieth century. The book, titled &quot;Peter Calvay, Hermit: A Personal Rediscovery of Prayer&quot;, was first published in 1977 and has had at least eleven reprintings.

Torkington&#x27;s book &quot;Wisdom from the Western Isles: The Making of a Mystic&quot;, published in 2008, also describes the author&#x27;s meetings with Peter Calvay whilst he was staying on Barra.

===Other===
In 2008 the Barra RNLI Life Boat, &quot;Edna Windsor&quot;, was featured on a series of stamps. The first class stamp shows the Severn class lifeboat in action in the Sound of Berneray southwest of Barra in swell with of wind.

== Transport ==
===Air===
Barra&#x27;s airport, near Northbay, uses the cockle shell beach of Traigh Mhor, (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;The Great Beach&quot;) as a runway. Planes can land and take off only at low tide, so the timetable varies. Voted the world&#x27;s most scenic landing location using a scheduled flight, Barra&#x27;s airport is claimed to be the only airport in the world to have regular scheduled flights landing on a beach. 
 (Barra and Vatersay Community) Ltd is a community-owned company whose aim is to support community development on Barra and Vatersay. The company is managed by a volunteer board of directors drawn from the membership. Membership is open to residents of the two islands whose names appear on the voting register.

The company&#x27;s latest project is a 900 kW Enercon E-44 wind turbine installed at , at the most northwesterly point of the island. At the time of construction, it was anticipated that the wind resource would make this one of the most productive 900 kW turbines in Western Europe.

== Climate ==
Barra has an oceanic climate, with mild temperatures year-round.

<doc id="143577" wikidata="Q489666" url="?curid=143577" title="The Wombles">
<text>The Wombles are fictional pointy-nosed, furry creatures created by Elisabeth Beresford and originally appearing in a series of children&#x27;s novels from 1968. They live in burrows, where they aim to help the environment by collecting and recycling rubbish in creative ways. Although Wombles supposedly live in every country in the world, Beresford&#x27;s stories are primarily concerned with the lives of the inhabitants of the burrow on Wimbledon Common in London, England.

The characters gained a higher national profile in the UK in the mid-1970s as a result of the popularity of a BBC-commissioned children&#x27;s television show which used stop-motion animation. A number of spin-off novelty songs also became hits in the British music charts. The Wombles pop group was the idea of British singer and composer Mike Batt.

The Womble motto is &quot;Make Good Use of Bad Rubbish&quot;. This environmentally friendly message was a reflection of the growing environmental movement of the 1970s.

==Background==
Elisabeth Beresford took her young children for a Boxing Day walk on Wimbledon Common, where her daughter Kate repeatedly mispronounced it as &quot;Wombledon Common&quot;, sparking the idea of the Wombles in her mother&#x27;s mind. On getting home, Beresford wrote down the idea and started developing the characters and storylines. She developed most of her Womble characters around members of her family, and named them after places the family had associations with.

== Plot aspects ==
=== Physical characteristics ===
Wombles are essentially burrowing animals. Beresford&#x27;s original book describes them as &quot;a bit like teddy bears to look at but they have real claws and live beneath Wimbledon Common&quot;. As they mostly live in long-established burrows, they rarely use their claws, even for digging. Their size and physical appearance has changed somewhat over the years: in the original editions of the books, Wombles are pictured as bear-like and between 3 and 5 feet (about 1–1.5 metres) in height, making them only slightly smaller than adult humans. This changed with the TV series, in which they were portrayed as being about knee-high to humans, with pointy snouts like those of hedgehogs. In the book and film &quot;Wombling Free&quot;, they are described as &quot;short, fat, and furry&quot;, roughly between three or four feet (about 1 metre) in height.

Wombles are herbivores and are very fond of mushrooms. They eat a variety of plants, fungi, and tree products that human beings cannot (or will not) eat, so daisy buns, moss pie, acorn juice, fir-cone soufflé, elm bark casserole, and grass bread sandwiches are part of the Womble menu – augmented by any food left behind on the Common by human beings. All Wombles are strong swimmers and can even survive for long periods in ice-cold water. Several sub-species of Womble are revealed throughout the books: the &quot;Loch Ness Monster&quot; is actually part of a clan of water Wombles and the yeti of the Himalayas are giant snow-white Wombles. Wombles have a sixth sense that allows them to sense green spaces and wildlife: this is first mentioned in the &quot;Wandering Wombles&quot; but developed to a keen long-range telepathic sense by Dalai Gartok Womble in &quot;The Wombles Go Round The World&quot;.

=== Culture and society ===
Though it is stated that Wombles live all around the world, Beresford&#x27;s collection of stories, as well as the television series and the music, focus on a group living in Wimbledon Common in London, England, with the sole exception of &quot;The Wombles Go Round The World&quot;.

Wombles care for and educate their young at a communal level. As with human children, immature Wombles are taught reading, writing and athletic skills, which they learn by playing a game called &quot;Wombles and Ladders&quot;. Some older Wombles play this game too, though most regard it as childish. Below a certain (unspecified) age, all Wombles are nameless; upon being deemed to be of working age, a Womble chooses his or her name by looking through Great Uncle Bulgaria&#x27;s large atlas until they find a name that suits them. Some, Bungo for example, &quot;merely shut their eyes tight and point and hope for the best&quot;. They then leave Miss Adelaide&#x27;s &quot;Womblegarten&quot; and join in the communal work of the burrow, which is mostly clearing up and recycling human refuse.

Wombles are very careful to keep their existence secret from human beings – at least in the books and TV series – fearing that discovery of their existence will lead to the Great Womble Hunt. For the most part, adult human beings rarely take notice of them, or fail to distinguish them from humans. In the film &quot;Wombling Free&quot; this is reversed as the Wombles seek to get humans to listen to their pleas to &quot;make good use of bad rubbish&quot;.

Wombles generally have a low opinion of other animal species, though they are never unkind to them. They have a poor opinion of humans in general, though there are exceptions, such 
as royalty, especially the Queen. They also have a respect for human literature; the Wimbledon Wombles maintain a large library of books left by humans on the Common, and Great Uncle Bulgaria is fond of reading &quot;The Times&quot;.

== Production ==
=== Children&#x27;s novels ===

There were five novels and a short story collection:
# &quot;The Wombles&quot; (1968)
# &quot;The Wandering Wombles&quot; (1970)
# &quot;The Wombles at Work&quot; (1973)
# &quot;The Invisible Womble and Other Stories&quot; (1973)
# &quot;The Wombles to the Rescue&quot; (1974)
# &quot;The Wombles Go Round the World&quot; (1976)

All of these were out of print for many years until they were republished by Bloomsbury, from 2010 to 2011, along with the 1973 short-story collection &quot;The Invisible Womble&quot;, with all-new illustrations by Nick Price. In &quot;The Wandering Wombles&quot;, the setting moved from Wimbledon Common to Hyde Park in central London, but &quot;The Wombles to the Rescue&quot; saw them return to Wimbledon Common.

Four of the books were illustrated by Margaret Gordon. &quot;The Wombles at Work&quot; (1973) was illustrated by Barry Leith, who worked on set design for the original FilmFair series. &quot;The Wandering Wombles&quot; (1970) was illustrated by Oliver Chadwick. The appearance of the Wombles in the books followed the design of the Ivor Wood TV puppets, with the exception of original editions of &quot;The Wombles&quot; (1968) and first printings of &quot;The Wandering Wombles&quot;, which preceded the TV series and depicted the Wombles as teddy bear-like creatures. When the 1973 animated Wombles series was in pre-production, a decision was made to change the design of the characters so that they did not resemble teddy bears, as it was felt that there were too many children&#x27;s shows with teddy bear characters. There is a reference in the first book to dark brown being the colour of their fur (with the exception of the oldest Wombles whose fur turns white) but this was changed to silvery grey, save for the neck, which is black. Some of the toys and book illustrations do not show the black fur on the neck.

There is an audiobook of &quot;The Wombles&quot;, narrated by Bernard Cribbins.

Beresford wrote a collection of short stories entitled &quot;The Invisible Womble and Other Stories&quot; (1973); these stories were based on episodes from the TV series, although they occasionally refer to events in the novels.

In addition to these books, many annuals, picture books and children&#x27;s early readers have been published over the years, some of which were also written by Beresford.

=== Television ===
A stop-motion animated series of five-minute episodes was made between 1973 and 1975, along with two half-hour specials. Narration and all Womble voices for these were provided by Bernard Cribbins.

Further animated episodes, using new animation models and sets, were made by Cinar/Filmfair in 1998–1999. These were ten minutes long and had several Canadian actors provide the voices. Background music was adapted from the Wombles&#x27; records along with new compositions.

A CGI animated series of 52 episodes, under the guidance of Mike Batt&#x27;s Dramatico Productions, who bought the rights to The Wombles for Channel 5&#x27;s preschool slot &quot;Milkshake!&quot;, was intended for airing in 2015. Ray Winstone and Cribbins were confirmed as the voices of this new series. Only two of the planned episodes were screened, however, at the Cambridge Film Festival in November 2016. Batt filed for bankruptcy the following year in September, and resigned as director of Dramatico Productions.

=== Music ===

Songwriter and producer Mike Batt wrote the series&#x27; theme tune, but negotiated the musical rights to the characters in place of the traditional composer&#x27;s fee. In an effort to promote the Wombles&#x27; first single, he had his mother make him a Womble costume, which he wore for most of the working week. After the Wombles&#x27; first chart hit, he went on to perform and produce a number of successful novelty singles as The Wombles in the 1970s. They amassed eight Top 40 singles in the UK and reached No. 55 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart with 1974&#x27;s, &quot;Wombling Summer Party&quot; single on Columbia Records. They were awarded the &quot;Music Week&quot; Award for Top Singles Band of 1974. Reissues of the Wombles&#x27; music in the late 1990s and early 2000s also charted, extending their number of UK chart hits to thirteen.

=== Merchandise ===
Stop-motion animation is an expensive means of making a programme, due to the amount of time required. Animation production houses used to rely on international sales of their productions to cover costs, and merchandising was once considered a welcome bonus. Rising labour and production costs, however, have made merchandising a necessary revenue stream for any new programme. &quot;The Wombles&quot; TV series had originally been commissioned because of the popularity of the stories on UK children&#x27;s TV programme &quot;Jackanory&quot;, with little thought given to merchandising, so the Wombles&#x27; initial merchandising was conducted in a haphazard way. Following the overwhelming success of merchandising for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, merchandising became the prime driver of and precursor to new productions. Prior to &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the story had come first and its popularity led to the commissioning of a TV series, followed by merchandise. After &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the situation reversed itself, and toy design came first. Demand for Wombles merchandise in the UK was driven by the popularity of the TV programme and books, but there were restrictions on toy advertising in the UK that kept TV merchandising in check.

The Wombles were merchandised in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand. Products include stuffed toys along with stationery, stickers, small figurines, bath soap, night lights, lamp shades, chocolate bars, gelatin pudding kits, posters, games, shirts, badges (buttons), cloth patches, and other items. The revival of the series in the late 1990s brought with it another wave of merchandise which included lunch boxes, umbrellas, flannels (face cloths), hot water bottle covers, slippers, a Steiff doll, and a set of postage stamps for Alderney, a Channel Island that served as the name for one of the Wombles and the home of Beresford until her death. More recently, the Wombles were part of a set of UK postage stamps honouring classic British children&#x27;s TV programmes. In 2013, Mike Batt and Elisabeth Beresford&#x27;s two children consolidated the merchandising copyrights to the Wombles in a new company, Wombles Copyright Holdings, of which Batt became the principal shareholder with creative control held by Beresford&#x27;s heirs. This included the purchase of the &quot;Wombles&quot; TV series from DHX Media, who had acquired it with their purchase of Cookie Jar Entertainment in 2012.

=== Film ===

A feature-length live-action movie &quot;Wombling Free&quot; was released in 1977, written and directed by Lionel Jeffries and starring The Wombles, David Tomlinson, Frances de la Tour and Bonnie Langford. A soundtrack album was released in 1978. A region 2 DVD of the film was released by Network in 2006, containing the film in its theatrical aspect ratio, the original theatrical trailer, and archive interviews with Jeffries, Tomlinson and Langford.

=== Other appearances ===
A feral pack of Wombles appeared in BBC comedy series &quot;The Goodies&quot; in the episode &quot;The Goodies Rule – O.K.?&quot;, engaging in a fierce wrestling match with Bill Oddie.

In 2011, The Wombles performed live at Glastonbury.

The Wombles were the interval entertainment at Eurovision Song Contest 1974.

=== Sport ===

Due to the Wombles&#x27; association with the area, some local sporting teams representing Wimbledon are sometimes affectionately nicknamed &quot;the Wombles&quot;. These teams include the Ladies side of Wimbledon RFC, whose mascot is &quot;Alderney&quot;, the Wimbledon Volleyball Club, and the Wombles Netball Club.

From 2000 to June 2003, Wimbledon F.C. used a Womble named &quot;Wandle&quot; as a club mascot, named after the local River Wandle. After the 2002 relocation of the club to Milton Keynes, the licence to use the character was not renewed beyond June 2003. In 2006, the club&#x27;s Wimbledon successor, AFC Wimbledon, made a licensing deal with Beresford and launched its own Womble mascot. After a naming competition in which the final name was chosen by Elisabeth Beresford herself, AFC Wimbledon announced that the new Womble would be known as &quot;Haydon&quot;, after Haydons Road, the nearest railway station to Wimbledon&#x27;s original home ground, Plough Lane. Twelve years later, the club announced plans to return to their original neighbourhood; Haydons Road is also the closest station to their new ground.

Beresford also gave permission for a team of Wombles to run the London Marathon.

===Reboot===
Altitude Television is working on a reboot with Will Davies writing a script for it.

== Characters ==

* Great Uncle Bulgaria Coburg – the oldest and wisest of the Wimbledon Wombles and their leader. He is based on Beresford&#x27;s father-in-law and named after the country and the German city, respectively. He occasionally frightens the younger Wombles with his stern demeanour (and particularly his habit of glaring at them through two pairs of spectacles) but is actually very kind. He is over 300 years old by the final book.
* Tobermory – an engineer, based on Beresford&#x27;s brother, a skilled inventor, and named after the capital of the Isle of Mull, in the Scottish Inner Hebrides. He has a gruff and surly manner but like Bulgaria (with whom he has been friends for many years) he has a very kindly heart. 
* Orinoco – a shirker who loves sleep and food, styled on Beresford&#x27;s teenage son and named after the river in South America. Though lazy and slothful by nature, Orinoco is resourceful and always means well, and is capable of some surprising acts of moral and physical courage.
* Bungo – over-enthusiastic and bossy, named after the province of Bungo in Japan. He is Orinoco&#x27;s best friend and based on Beresford&#x27;s daughter.
* Tomsk – an athletic but rather dim Womble, named after the city of Tomsk in Russia. He acts as the official &quot;Nightwatch Womble&quot; (and Daywatch Womble on occasion). He is an extremely keen golf player, and plays on the Wimbledon Common Golf Club course situated on the common, where human visitors have occasionally noted his talent for the sport. He is the largest and strongest of the Wimbledon Wombles.
* Wellington – scientifically inclined, but very insecure and absent-minded. Named after Beresford&#x27;s nephew&#x27;s school, Wellington School, Somerset, though Wellington himself later states that he chose his name from the city of Wellington in New Zealand.
* Madame Cholet – a very kind-hearted but short-tempered female Womble, and the cook of the Wimbledon burrow, styled on Beresford&#x27;s mother and named after the town of Cholet in France. She affects a French accent, though she is actually no more French than any other Wimbledon Womble and simply likes to think of herself as French. 
* Alderney – Madame Cholet&#x27;s assistant, named after Alderney in the Channel Islands where Beresford lived towards the end of her life. She appeared in the early books, but was not in the first TV series. Her character was revived in the second TV series. She is a precocious young Womble with a slight disregard for the rules.

Later character names for the film &quot;Wombling Free&quot; and second Wombles TV series were developed in the same manner:

* Cousin Cairngorm McWomble the Terrible – named after the Cairngorms, a mountain range in Scotland. He was introduced in the second book (&quot;The Wandering Wombles&quot;) as an incredibly fierce Highland Womble clan chief. As his name suggests, he considers himself very formidable, but it is later proved that &quot;his talk is worse than his claws&quot;. He appeared in the TV series when he visited the Wimbledon burrow. 
* Shansi – named after the province of Shansi in China, she came to the Wimbledon burrow on an exchange from China, and is often paired with Alderney, as Bungo was with Orinoco. She is a shy and quiet womble who is much happier with Miss Adelaide in the Womblegarten than anywhere else, and has a decided talent for art.
* Stepney – an East Ender with dreadlocks, who got his name from the part of London that he came from. Created for television.
* Obidos – named after the town of Óbidos in Brazil. Created for television.

Some other characters were detailed in the books but never appeared in the television series:

* Miss Adelaide – the burrow&#x27;s schoolmistress and head of the Womblegarten and a great friend of Madame Cholet, named after the city of Adelaide in Australia. A very strict but fair Womble, she has the ability to make even Great Uncle Bulgaria feel silly.
* Cousin Yellowstone Boston – named after Yellowstone National Park and Boston. Cousin Yellowstone originally appeared in the first book when he visited the Wimbledon Wombles, where he grew up, and was subsequently revealed to be one of the only Wombles noticed by a human, resulting in what became known as &quot;The Great Kidnapping of 1915&quot;, when Yellowstone boarded a boat from Britain after being chased by police, and travelled through most of the world, meeting other Womble tribes and nearly starving to death in Canada before finally arriving in America. He says that he always meant to return to Wimbledon, but ended up settling into his life in America more than he had imagined, later becoming the patriarch of the tribe of American Wombles in Yellowstone Park. He is roughly the same age as Tobermory, and introduced the Wimbledon Wombles to American novelties such as a deep freeze. Though he still loves his original home, he considers the States &quot;a great country if you&#x27;re a Womble&quot;. 
* Cousin Botany – named after Botany Bay in Australia. He does not make an appearance until the fifth book (&quot;The Wombles to the Rescue&quot;), and at first was a quiet and surly Womble who has been living alone in the Wimbledon burrow before the Wombles&#x27; return to it. He does not have an active role until Tomsk and Wellington attempt to draw out oil from the bottom of Queen&#x27;s Mere, when it is discovered that he had been attempting to grow water-plants there as a sustainable food source for the burrow. He is furious with them for destroying his plants until an alternative is offered, and he spent the rest of the books tending to his water-plants in new specialised tanks in the back of the burrow.
* Great-Great-Great Uncle Hapsburg von Hohenzollern – named after two German royal houses. He is the leader of the Black Forest Wombles, and is arguably the most famous Womble in the world, though he likes to keep himself and his Womble clan to themselves. He is also one of the oldest Wombles alive, referring to Great Uncle Bulgaria as &quot;Young Bulgaria&quot;. His Wombles are noted to be some of the most skilled with their rubbish, as he has more beautiful furniture in his burrow than almost any other and his cook, Frau Heidelberg, is said to rival even Madame Cholet.
* Great Aunt Thessaly (sometimes Great-Great Aunt Thessaly) – named after the province of Thessaly in Greece. The former leader of the Wombles before Great Uncle Bulgaria, she was noted to be &#x27;very old and very wise&#x27;, and is known to have taken a young Bulgaria to see the guards of Queen Victoria, and a young Cousin Yellowstone to Wimbledon Tennis Tournament. Her name was occasionally spelt &quot;Thessally&quot; in earlier editions of the first book.

Other characters:
* Nessie – a &quot;Water-Womble&quot;, named after the famous Loch Ness in Scotland. Nessie is part of a declining sub-species of aquatic Wombles, a larger breed with webbed paws who prioritise the cleaning of their body of water. In the Womble world, Water-Wombles, specifically Nessie, are the basis for the legend of the Loch Ness Monster, and due to Wombles being a self-contained species, Nessie dislikes the attention surrounding the legend and wishes she were as unknown as the &quot;Land Wombles&quot;. Nessie also has two young Water-Womble charges named Ross and Cromarty. All of them are under the protection of the McWomble, and Nessie refers to him as her &quot;best friend&quot;.
* Omsk – a Russian womble who came to the Hyde Park burrow via the Russian embassy near Kensington Gardens. He later takes over the burrow in Hyde Park. He is named after the city of Omsk in Russia. 
* Cousin Idaho – Yellowstone&#x27;s Native American assistant, named after the American state of Idaho.
* Ms Atlanta – the cook of the American burrow, named after the city of Atlanta, Georgia. She holds great respect for Madame Cholet.
* Dalai Gartok – the leader of the &quot;Great White Wombles&quot; of the Himalayas, named after the Tibetan town of Gartok. He and his Wombles inspired the legends of the Yeti. Dalai Gartok is also one of the oldest known Wombles, and has honed his Womble senses to the extent that he has considerable telepathic ability.
* Great-Great Aunt Matilda Murrumbidgee – the leader of the New South Wales Wombles, named after Murrumbidgee River in Australia. She is very fierce and irritable, though Tomsk manages to stand up to her.
** Cairns and Perth – named after the respective cities in Australia and inhabitants of the Australian Burrow.
** Eucula – &quot;cook-in-chief&quot; of the Australian burrow, named after a misspelling of the easternmost town in Western Australia.
* Honourable Cousin Tokyo – the quiet and dignified leader of the Japanese Wombles, named after the capital of Japan.
** Hirado – the &quot;Workshop Master&quot; of the Japanese burrow, named after the city of Hirado, Nagasaki.
* Quetta – a womble whom Yellowstone met while travelling the world, who comes from a burrow on the Khyber Pass. Quetta is named after the capital of Balochistan. 
* Chieftain Fashven – the oldest of the Womble clan leaders in Scotland, and the last to be able to speak Womble Gaelic. The character is named after Fashven Hill in the far north of Scotland.
* Nanking – a Womble in a secretive Chinese community in San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown, named after the city in China.
* Tante Lille – the leader of &quot;Les Wombleaux of Boulogne&quot;, named after the northern French town of Lille.
* Cousin Van Amsterdam – the leader of a group of Dutch Wombles, named after the capital of Holland.
* Onkel Bonn – the leader of a group of German Wombles, named after Bonn.
* Uncle Dunedin – the leader of the New Zealand Wombles, named after Dunedin.

In the first book, Bungo is the youngest and least experienced of the team, and the story is mostly viewed through his eyes. Later Wellington (who was not introduced until the second book) took over the role of &quot;new boy&quot;, and even later on, Shansi takes Bungo&#x27;s place as the youngest working Womble. Alderney and Miss Adelaide appeared in the earlier books but were not included in the original 1970s TV series. Alderney was re-introduced in the later TV shows produced in the 1990s (the Channel Island of Alderney was actually Elisabeth Beresford&#x27;s home at the time), along with Stepney (who appeared in none of the earlier versions).

== Parodies ==
The Wombles are parodied (as Rumbles - haughty, rat-like creatures that can&#x27;t pronounce their &#x27;R&#x27;s) in Michael de Larrabeiti&#x27;s novel The Borribles.

<text>The Inner Hebrides ( ; ) is an archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland, to the south east of the Outer Hebrides. Together these two island chains form the Hebrides, which experience a mild oceanic climate. The Inner Hebrides comprise 35 inhabited islands as well as 44 uninhabited islands with an area greater than . Skye, Mull, and Islay are the three largest, and also have the highest populations. The main commercial activities are tourism, crofting, fishing and whisky distilling. In modern times the Inner Hebrides have formed part of two separate local government jurisdictions, one to the north and the other to the south. Together, the islands have an area of about , and had a population of 18,948 in 2011. The population density is therefore about .

There are various important prehistoric structures, many of which pre-date the first written references to the islands by Roman and Greek authors. In the historic period the earliest known settlers were Picts to the north and Gaels in the southern kingdom of Dál Riada prior to the islands becoming part of the &quot;Suðreyjar&quot; kingdom of the Norse, who ruled for over 400 years until sovereignty was transferred to Scotland by the Treaty of Perth in 1266. Control of the islands was then held by various clan chiefs, principally the MacLeans, MacLeods and MacDonalds. The Highland Clearances of the 19th century had a devastating effect on many communities and it is only in recent years that population levels have ceased to decline.

Sea transport is crucial and a variety of ferry services operate to mainland Scotland and between the islands. The Gaelic language remains strong in some areas; the landscapes have inspired a variety of artists; and there is a diversity of wildlife.


==Geography==

The islands form a disparate archipelago. The largest islands are, from south to north, Islay, Jura, Mull, Rùm and Skye. Skye is the largest and most populous of all with an area of and a population of just over 10,000.

The southern group are in Argyll, an area roughly corresponding with the heartlands of the ancient kingdom of Dál Riata and incorporated into the modern unitary council area of Argyll and Bute. The northern islands were part of the county of Inverness-shire and are now in the Highland Council area.

===Physical===

The ten largest islands are as follows.

The geology and geomorphology of the islands is varied. Some, such as Skye and Mull, are mountainous, whilst others like Tiree are relatively low-lying. The highest mountains are the Cuillins of Skye, although peaks over are common elsewhere. Much of the coastline is machair, a fertile low-lying dune pastureland. Many of the islands are swept by strong tides, and the Corryvreckan tide race between Scarba and Jura is one of the largest whirlpools in the world.

There are various smaller archipelagoes including the Ascrib Islands, Crowlin Islands, Slate Islands, Small Isles, Summer Isles and Treshnish Islands.

The islands are shown to be important as a region of tidal mixing of coastal water.

===Human===
The inhabited islands of the Inner Hebrides had a population of 18,257 at the 2001 census, and this grew to 18,948 in 2011. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.
There are a further 44 uninhabited Inner Hebrides with an area greater than . Records for the last date of settlement for the smaller islands are incomplete, but most of them were inhabited at some point during the Neolithic, Iron Age, Early Historic or Norse periods. In common with the other main island chains of Scotland, many of the smaller and more remote islands were abandoned during the 19th and 20th centuries, in some cases after continuous habitation since prehistoric times. These islands had been perceived as relatively self-sufficient agricultural economies, but a view developed among both islanders and outsiders that the more remote islands lacked the essential services of a modern industrial economy. However, the populations of the larger islands grew overall by more than 12% from 1981 to 2001.

The main commercial activities are tourism, crofting, fishing and whisky distilling (centred on Islay but also including Talisker in Skye, Isle of Jura Single Malt and Tobermory and Ledaig in Mull). Overall, the area is relatively reliant on primary industries and the public sector; there is a dependence on self-employment and micro-business, and most parts are defined by Highlands and Islands Enterprise as economically &quot;Fragile Areas&quot;. However, the islands are well placed to exploit renewable energy, particularly onshore and offshore wind; and the Sleat peninsula of Skye is an example of a more economically robust area. Some of the islands have development trusts that support the local economy.

===Climate===
The influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the North Atlantic Current creates a mild oceanic climate. Temperatures are generally cool, averaging 6.5 °C (44 °F) in January and 15.4 °C (60 °F) in July at Duntulm on the Trotternish peninsula of Skye. Snow seldom lies at sea level and frosts are fewer than on the mainland. Winds are a limiting factor for vegetation: a speed of 128 km/h (80 mph) has been recorded; south-westerlies are the most common. Rainfall is generally high at between per annum, and the mountains and hills are wetter still. Tiree is one of the sunniest places in the country and had 300 days of sunshine in 1975. Trotternish typically has 200 hours of bright sunshine in May, the sunniest month.

==Prehistory==

The Hebrides were originally settled in the Mesolithic era and have a diversity of prehistoric sites. A flint arrowhead found in a field near Bridgend, Islay has been dated to 10,800 BCE. This find may indicate the presence of a summer hunting party rather than permanent settlement. Burnt hazelnut shells and microscopic charcoal found at Farm Fields, Kinloch on Rùm indicate a settlement of some kind and this is amongst the oldest evidence of occupation in Scotland.

Evidence of large-scale Mesolithic nut processing, radiocarbon dated to circa 7000 BCE, has been found in a midden pit at Staosnaig on Colonsay. The dig discovered the remains of hundreds of thousands of burned hazelnut shells and gives an insight into communal activity and forward planning in the period. The nuts were harvested in a single year and pollen analysis suggests that the hazel trees were all cut down at the same time. The scale of the activity, unparalleled elsewhere in Scotland, and the lack of large game on the island, suggests the possibility that Colonsay contained a community with a largely vegetarian diet for the time they spent on the island.

Three stone hearths and traces of red ochre found on Jura and dated to 6000 BCE are the earliest stone-built structures found so far in Scotland. However, in general the Neolithic sites in the Inner Hebrides lack the scale and drama of those found in Orkney and the Western Isles. There are numerous Iron Age sites including the remains of Dun Ringill fort on Skye, which are similar in layout to that of both a broch and a complex Atlantic roundhouse.

==Etymology==

The earliest extant written reference to these islands appears in Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;, where he states that there are 30 &quot;Hebudes&quot;. Ptolemy, writing about 80 years later, around AD 140-150 and drawing on the earlier naval expedition of Agricola, refers to the Ἐβοῦδαι (&quot;Eboudai&quot;) (&quot;Ebudes&quot; or &quot;Ebudae&quot; in Latin translation) of which he writes that there were only five, thus possibly specifically meaning the Inner Hebrides. Pliny probably took his information from Pytheas of Massilia who visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285 BCE. It is possible that Ptolemy did so also, as Agricola&#x27;s information about the west coast of Scotland was of poor quality.

Watson (1926) states that the meaning of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Eboudai&quot; is unknown and that the root may be pre-Celtic. Other early written references include the flight of the Nemed people from Ireland to &quot;Domon and to Erdomon in the north of Alba&quot;, which is mentioned in the 12th century &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;. Domon, meaning the &quot;deep sea isle&quot; refers to the Outer Hebrides and Erdomon, meaning &quot;east of, on or near Domon&quot; is thus the Inner Hebrides.

The individual island and place names in the Outer Hebrides have mixed Gaelic and Norse origins.

==History==

===Dál Riata===

Although Ptolemy&#x27;s map identifies various tribes such as the &quot;Creones&quot; that might conceivably have lived in the Inner Hebrides in the Roman era,
the first written records of life begin in the 6th century CE when the founding of the kingdom of Dál Riata is recorded. This encompassed roughly what is now Argyll and Bute and Lochaber in Scotland and County Antrim in Ireland.

In Argyll it consisted initially of three main kindreds: Cenél Loairn in north and mid-Argyll, Cenél nÓengusa based on Islay and Cenél nGabráin based in Kintyre. By the end of the 7th century a fourth kindred, Cenél Comgaill had emerged, based in eastern Argyll.

The figure of Columba looms large in any history of Dál Riata and his founding of a monastery on Iona ensured that Dál Riata would be of great importance in the spread of Christianity in northern Britain. However, Iona was far from unique. Lismore in the territory of the Cenél Loairn, was sufficiently important for the death of its abbots to be recorded with some frequency and many smaller sites, such as on Eigg, Hinba and Tiree, are known from the annals. The kingdom&#x27;s independent existence ended in the Viking Age, and it eventually merged with the lands of the Picts to form the Kingdom of Alba.

North of Dál Riata the Inner Hebrides were nominally under Pictish control although the historical record is sparse.

===Norse rule===
According to Ó Corráin (1998) &quot;when and how the Vikings conquered and occupied the Isles is unknown, perhaps unknowable&quot; although from 793 onwards repeated raids by Vikings on the British Isles are recorded. &quot;All the islands of Britain&quot; were devastated in 794 with Iona being sacked in 802 and 806. In 870 Dumbarton was besieged by Amlaíb Conung and Ímar, &quot;the two kings of the Northmen&quot;. It is therefore likely that Scandinavian hegemony was already significant on the western coasts of Scotland by then. In the 9th century the first references to the &quot;Gallgáedil&quot; (i.e. &quot;foreign Gaels&quot;) appear. This term was variously used in succeeding centuries to refer to individuals of mixed Scandinavian-Celtic descent and/or culture who became dominant in south-west Scotland, parts of Northern England and the isles.

The early 10th century are an obscure period so far as the Hebrides are concerned but Aulaf mac Sitric, who fought at the Battle of Brunanburh in 937 is recorded as a King of the Isles from c. 941 to 980.

It is difficult to reconcile the records of the Irish annals with Norse sources such as the &quot;Orkneyinga Saga&quot; but it is likely that Norwegian and &quot;Gallgáedil&quot; Uí Ímair warlords fought for control for much of period from the 9th to the 12th centuries. In 990 Sigurd the Stout, Earl of Orkney took command of the Hebrides, a position he retained for most of the period until he was killed at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. There is then a period of uncertainty but it is possible that Sigurd&#x27;s son Thorfinn the Mighty became ruler circa 1035 until his own death some two decades later.

By the late 12th century Irish influence became a significant feature of island life and Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, the High King of Ireland took possession of Mann and the Isles until 1072. The records for the rulers of the Hebrides are obscured again until the arrival of Godred Crovan as King of Dublin and the Isles. The ancestor of many of the succeeding rulers of Mann and the Isles, he was eventually ousted by Muirchertach Ua Briain and fled to Islay, where he died in the plague of 1095. It is not clear the extent to which Ui Briain dominance was now asserted in the islands north of Man, but growing Irish influence in these seas brought a rapid and decisive response from Norway.

Magnus Barelegs had re-established direct Norwegian overlordship by 1098.
A second expedition in 1102 saw incursions into Ireland but in August 1103 he was killed fighting in Ulster. The next king of the isles was Lagmann Godredsson and there followed a succession of Godred Crovan&#x27;s descendants who, (as vassals of the kings of Norway) ruled the Hebrides north of Ardnamurchan for the next 160 years. However, their control of the southern Inner Hebrides was lost with the emergence of Somerled, the self-styled Lord of Argyle.

For a while Somerled took control of Mann and the Hebrides &quot;in toto&quot;, but he met his death in 1164 during an invasion of the Scottish mainland. At this point Godred the Black, grandson of Godred Crovan re-took possession of the northern Hebrides and the southern isles were distributed amongst Somerled&#x27;s sons, his descendants eventually becoming known as the Lords of the Isles, and giving rise to Clan MacDougall, Clan Donald and Clan Macruari. However, both during and after Somerled&#x27;s life the Scottish monarchs sought to take a control of the islands he and his descendants held. This strategy eventually led to an invasion by Haakon Haakonarson, King of Norway. After the stalemate of the Battle of Largs, Haakon retreated to Orkney, where he died in 1263. Following this expedition, the Hebrides and Mann and all rights that the Norwegian crown &quot;had of old therein&quot; were yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland as a result of the 1266 Treaty of Perth.

===Clans and Scottish rule===
The Lords of the Isles, a phrase first recorded in 1336, but which title may have been used earlier, would continue to rule the Inner Hebrides as well as part of the Western Highlands as subjects of the King of Scots until John MacDonald, fourth Lord of the Isles, squandered the family&#x27;s powerful position. Through a secret treaty with Edward IV of England, negotiated at Ardtornish Castle and signed in 1462, he made himself a servant of the English crown. When James III of Scotland found out about the treaty in 1476, he issued a sentence of forfeiture for MacDonald&#x27;s lands. Some were restored for a promise of good behaviour, but MacDonald was unable to control his son Aonghas Óg, who defeated him at the Battle of Bloody Bay, fought off the coast of Mull near Tobermory in 1481. A further rebellion by his nephew, Alexander of Lochalsh, provoked an exasperated James IV to forfeit the lands for the last time in 1493.

The most powerful clans on Skye in the post-Norse period were Clan MacLeod, originally based in Trotternish, and Clan MacDonald of Sleat. Following the disintegration of the Lordship of the Isles, the Mackinnons also emerged as an independent clan, whose substantial landholdings in Skye were centred on Strathaird. The MacDonalds of South Uist were bitter rivals of the MacLeods, and an attempt by the former to murder church-goers at Trumpan in retaliation for a previous massacre on Eigg, resulted in the Battle of the Spoiling Dyke of 1578.

After the failure of the Jacobite rebellion of 1745, Flora MacDonald became famous for rescuing Prince Charles Edward Stuart from the Hanoverian troops. Her story is strongly associated with their escape via Skye and she is buried at Kilmuir. She was visited by Samuel Johnson and James Boswell during their 1773 &quot;Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland&quot; and written on her gravestone are Johnson&#x27;s words that hers was &quot;A name that will be mentioned in history, and if courage and fidelity be virtues, mentioned with honour&quot;. In the wake of the rebellion the clan system was broken up and islands of the Hebrides became a series of landed estates.

===British era===

With the implementation of the Treaty of Union in 1707 the Hebrides became part of the new Kingdom of Great Britain, but the clans&#x27; loyalties to a distant monarch were not strong. A considerable number of islesmen &quot;came out&quot; in support of the Jacobite Earl of Mar in the &quot;15&quot; and again in the 1745 rising including Macleod of Dunvegan and MacLea of Lismore. The aftermath of the decisive Battle of Culloden, which effectively ended Jacobite hopes of a Stuart restoration, was widely felt. The British government&#x27;s strategy was to estrange the clan chiefs from their kinsmen and turn their descendants into English-speaking landlords whose main concern was the revenues their estates brought rather than the welfare of those who lived on them. This may have brought peace to the islands, but in the following century it came at a terrible price.

The early 19th century was a time of improvement and population growth. Roads and quays were built, the slate industry became a significant employer on Easdale and surrounding islands, and the construction of the Crinan and Caledonian canals and other engineering works such as Telford&#x27;s &quot;Bridge across the Atlantic&quot; improved transport and access. However, in the mid-19th century, the inhabitants of many parts of the Hebrides were devastated by the clearances, which destroyed communities throughout the Highlands and Islands as the human populations were evicted and replaced with sheep farms. The position was exacerbated by the failure of the islands&#x27; kelp industry that thrived from the 18th century until the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 and large scale emigration became endemic. The &quot;Battle of the Braes&quot; involved a demonstration against lack of access to land and the serving of eviction notices. This event was instrumental in the creation of the Napier Commission, which reported in 1884 on the situation in the Highlands. Disturbances continued until the passing of the 1886 Crofters&#x27; Act and on one occasion 400 marines were deployed on Skye to maintain order.

For those who remained new economic opportunities emerged through the export of cattle, commercial fishing and tourism. Nonetheless emigration and military service became the choice of many and the archipelago&#x27;s populations continued to dwindle throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries. Jura&#x27;s population fell from 1300 in 1831 to less than 250 by 1961 and Mull&#x27;s from 10,600 in 1821 to less than 3,000 in 1931. Lengthy periods of continuous occupation notwithstanding, some of the smaller islands were abandoned – the Treshnish Isles in 1934, Handa in 1948, and Eilean Macaskin in the 1880s among them.

Nonetheless, there were continuing gradual economic improvements, among the most visible of which was the replacement of the traditional thatched blackhouse with accommodation of a more modern design and in recent years, with the assistance of Highlands and Islands Enterprise many of the island&#x27;s populations have begun to increase after decades of decline.

==Transport==

Scheduled ferry services between the Inner Hebrides and the Scottish mainland operate on various routes including: Tayinloan, Kintyre to Gigha; Kennacraig, Kintyre to Islay; Oban to Mull, Coll and Tiree and Colonsay; Mallaig to Armadale, Skye and Eigg, Muck, Rùm &amp; Canna; and Glenelg to Kyle Rhea on the Sleat peninsula, Skye.

Some ferries reach the Inner Hebrides from other islands such as the Seil to Luing route, Fionnphort on the Ross of Mull to Iona, Sconser to Raasay and Port Askaig to Feolin, Jura. There is also a service to and from the Outer Hebrides from Tarbert, Harris and Lochmaddy on North Uist to Uig, Skye and from Castlebay, Barra to Tiree.

National Rail services are available for onward journeys, from stations at Oban, which has direct services to Glasgow and from Kyle of Lochalsh to Inverness. There are scheduled flights from Colonsay Airport, Islay Airport near Port Ellen and Tiree Airport.

The archipelago is exposed to wind and tide, and there are numerous sites of wrecked ships. Lighthouses are sited as an aid to navigation at various locations.
Dubh Artach lighthouse is located on a remote rock and warns seafarers away from the area itself and the nearby Torran Rocks. Originally it was considered to be an impossible site for a light, but the loss of the steamer &quot;Bussorah&quot; with all thirty-three hands on her maiden voyage in 1863 and of an astonishing 24 vessels in the area in a storm on 30–31 December 1865 encouraged positive action. Skerryvore is another remote lighthouse in the vicinity and at a height of it is the tallest in Scotland.

==Gaelic language==
There are about 4,000 Gaelic speakers in the Inner Hebrides, equal to 20% of the population of the archipelago.

There have been speakers of Goidelic languages in the Inner Hebrides since the time of Columba or before, and the modern variant of Scottish Gaelic (&quot;Gàidhlig&quot;) remains strong in some parts. However, the Education (Scotland) Act 1872 led to generations of Gaels being forbidden to speak their native language in the classroom, and is now recognised as having dealt a major blow to the language. Children were being beaten for speaking Gaelic in school as late as the 1930s. More recently the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act was enacted by the Scottish Parliament in 2005 in order to provide continuing support for the language.

By the time of the 2001 census Kilmuir parish in Skye had 47% Gaelic speakers, with Skye overall having an unevenly distributed 31%. At that time Tiree had 48% of the population Gaelic-speaking, Lismore 29%, Islay 24%, Coll 12%, Jura 11%, Mull 13% and Iona 5%. Students of Scottish Gaelic travel from all over the world to attend Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, a Scottish Gaelic college based on Skye.

==The arts==

Hebridean landscapes have inspired a variety of musicians, writers and artists. &quot;The Hebrides&quot;, also known as &quot;Fingal&#x27;s Cave&quot;, is a famous overture written by Felix Mendelssohn inspired by his visit to Staffa. Marie Dare&#x27;s &quot;Hebridean Suite&quot; for cello and piano was composed in 1947. Contemporary musicians associated with the islands include Ian Anderson, Donovan, Chris Rainbow and Runrig. Enya&#x27;s song &quot;Ebudæ&quot; from &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot; is based on a traditional waulking song.

The poet Sorley MacLean was born on Raasay, the setting for his best known poem, &quot;Hallaig&quot;. George Orwell wrote much of the novel &quot;1984&quot; whilst living at Barnhill on Jura and J.M. Barrie wrote a screenplay for the 1924 film adaptation of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; whilst on Eilean Shona. Cressida Cowell, the author of &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot;, spent childhood summers in the Inner Hebrides and has stated that they are &quot;one of the most beautiful places on Earth&quot; and &quot;the kind of place where you expect to see dragons overhead&quot;.
==Wildlife==

In some respects the Hebrides generally lack biodiversity in comparison to mainland Britain, with for example only half the number of mammalian species the latter has. However, these islands have much to offer the naturalist. Observing the local abundance found on Skye in the 18th century Samuel Johnson noted that:

In the modern era avian life includes the corncrake, red-throated diver, rock dove, kittiwake, tystie, Atlantic puffin, goldeneye, golden eagle and white-tailed sea eagle. The last named was re-introduced to Rùm in 1975 and has successfully spread to various neighbouring islands, including Mull. There is a small population of red-billed chough concentrated on the islands of Islay and Colonsay.

Mountain hare (apparently absent from Skye in the 18th century) and rabbit are now abundant and predated on by Scottish wildcat and pine marten. Red deer are common on the hills and the grey seal and common seal are present around the coasts of Scotland in internationally important numbers, with colonies of the former found on Oronsay and the Treshnish Isles and the latter most abundant in the Firth of Lorn. The rich fresh water streams contain brown trout, Atlantic salmon and water shrew. Offshore minke whales, killer whales, basking sharks, porpoises and dolphins are among the sea life that can be seen and edible crab and oyster are also found, in for example, the Sound of Scalpay. There are nationally important horse mussel and brittlestar beds in the sea lochs.

Heather moor containing ling, bell heather, cross-leaved heath, bog myrtle and fescues is abundant and there is a diversity of arctic and alpine plants including alpine pearlwort and mossy cyphal.

<text>Sir Benjamin Baker (31 March 1840 – 19 May 1907) was an English civil engineer who worked in mid to late Victorian era. He helped develop the early underground railways in London with Sir John Fowler, but he is best known for his work on the Forth Bridge. He made many other notable contributions to civil engineering, including his work as an expert witness at the public inquiry into the Tay Bridge disaster. Later, he helped design and build the first Aswan dam.

==Early life and career==
He was born in Keyford, which is now part of Frome, Somerset in 1840, the son of Benjamin Baker, principal assistant at Tondu Ironworks, and Sarah Hollis. There is a plaque on their house in Butts Hill. He was educated at Cheltenham Grammar School and, at the age of 16, became an apprentice at Messrs Price and Fox at the Neath Abbey Iron Works. After his apprenticeship he spent two years as an assistant to Mr. W.H. Wilson. Later, he became associated with Sir John Fowler in London. He took part in the construction of the Metropolitan Railway (London). He was also a key expert witness in the Tay Bridge disaster of 1879.

He designed the cylindrical vessel in which Cleopatra&#x27;s Needle, now standing on the Thames Embankment, London, was brought over from Egypt to England in 1877–1878.

He obtained an extremely large professional practice, ranging over almost every branch of civil engineering, and was more or less directly concerned with most of the great engineering achievements of his day.

==Bridges==

He published a timely book on Long Railway Bridges in the 1870s which advocated the introduction of steel, and showed that much longer spans were possible using this material. The book is remarkably prescient for the way the properties of steel could be exploited in structures.

===Tay bridge disaster===

In 1880, Baker was called as an expert witness to the inquiry into the Tay Bridge disaster, in which part of the bridge failed and collapsed into the water. Although he was acting on behalf of Thomas Bouch, the builder of the first railway bridge across the Tay, he performed his role with independence and tenacity. His testified against the theory that the bridge was blown over by the wind that night. He made a meticulous survey of structures at or near the bridge, and concluded that wind speeds were not excessive on the night of the disaster. The official analysis of the failure suggested that a wind pressure of over 30 pounds per square foot was needed to cause toppling of the structure. Baker examined smaller structures in the vicinity of the bridge and concluded that the pressure could not have exceeded 15 pounds per square foot on the night of the bridge failure. Such smaller structures included walls, ballast on the track on the bridge, and both signal boxes either on or very near the bridge.
Baker said in his statement to the court that he had built over of railway viaduct, referring to his design of the elevated railroad in New York City in 1868, some of which still survives in Manhattan (unused). 

By this time he had already become established as an authority on bridge construction. Shortly afterwards he was engaged on the work which made his reputation with the general public: the design and erection of the Forth Bridge (1890) in collaboration with Sir John Fowler and William Arrol. It was an almost unique design as a large cantilever bridge, and was built entirely in steel, another unprecedented development in bridge engineering. Stiffness was provided by hollow tubes which were riveted together so as to make sound joints. Baker promoted his design in numerous public lectures, and arranged demonstrations of the stability of the cantilever by using his assistants as stage props.

===Forth Bridge===
With Sir John Fowler, he designed and engineered the Forth Bridge after the Tay bridge collapse. It was a cantilever bridge and Baker gave numerous lectures on the principles which lay behind his design. Thomas Bouch had originally been awarded the contract but he lost it after the Tay Bridge Inquiry reported in June 1880. The bridge was built entirely in steel, much stronger than cast iron. He used hollow steel tubes to create the cantilever, and it was then the largest bridge of its kind in the world. The bridge is regarded as an engineering marvel. It is in length, and the double track is elevated above high tide. It consists of two main spans of , two side spans of , 15 approach spans of and five of ).[3] Each main span comprises two 680 ft (210 m) cantilever arms supporting a central 350 ft (110 m) span girder bridge. The three great four-tower cantilever structures are 340 ft (104 m) tall, each 70 ft (21 m) diameter foot resting on a separate foundation. The southern group of foundations had to be constructed as caissons under compressed air, to a depth of 90 ft (27 m). At its peak, approximately 4,600 workers were employed in its construction. Initially, it was recorded that 57 lives were lost however after extensive research by local historians, the figure has been revised upwards to 98. Eight men who fell from the bridge were saved by boats positioned in the river under work areas. More than 55,000 tons of steel were used, as well as 18,122 m³ of granite and over eight million rivets. The bridge was opened on 4 March 1890 by the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, who drove home the last rivet, which was gold plated and suitably inscribed. A contemporary materials analysis of the bridge, c. 2002, found that the steel in the bridge is of good quality, with little variation.

The use of a cantilever in bridge design was not a new idea, but the scale of Baker&#x27;s undertaking was a pioneering effort, later followed in different parts of the world. Much of the work done was without precedent, including calculations for incidence of erection stresses, provisions made for reducing future maintenance costs, calculations for wind pressures made evident by the Tay Bridge disaster, the effect of temperature stresses on the structure, and so on.

Where possible, the bridge used natural features such as Inchgarvie, an island, the promontories on either side of the firth at this point, and also the high banks on either side. The remains of Thomas Bouch&#x27;s first attempts at his bridge can also be seen on the island.

The bridge has a speed limit of 50 mph (80 km/h) for passenger trains and 20 mph (32 km/h) for freight trains. The weight limit for any train on the bridge is 1,422 tonnes (1,442,000 kg) although this is waived for the frequent coal trains, provided two such trains do not simultaneously occupy the bridge. The route availability code is RA8, meaning any current UK locomotive can use the bridge, which was designed to accommodate heavier steam locomotives. Up to 190–200 trains per day crossed the bridge in 2006. A structure like the Forth Bridge needs constant maintenance and the ancillary works for the bridge included not only a maintenance workshop and yard but a railway &quot;colony&quot; of some fifty houses at Dalmeny Station.

&quot;Painting the Forth Bridge&quot; is a colloquial term for a never-ending task (a modern rendering of the myth of Sisyphus), coined on the erroneous belief that, at one time in the history of the bridge, repainting was required and commenced immediately upon completion of the previous repaint. According to a 2004 &quot;New Civil Engineer&quot; report on contemporary maintenance, such a practice never existed, although under British Rail management, and before, the bridge had a permanent maintenance crew.

A contemporary repainting of the bridge commenced with a contract award in 2002, for a schedule of work expected to continue until March 2009, involving the application of 20,000 m2 of paint at an estimated cost of £13M a year. This new coat of paint is expected to have a life of at least 25 years. In 2008 the total cost was revised upwards to £180M, and projections for finishing the job to 2012. In a report produced by JE Jacobs, Grant Thornton and Faber Maunsell in 2007 which reviewed the alternative options for a second road crossing, it was stated that the estimated working life of the Forth Bridge was in excess of 100 years.

==Honours and Old Aswan Dam==

On the completion of this undertaking in 1890 he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG), and in the same year the Royal Society recognised his scientific attainments by electing him one of its fellows. In 1892 the French Academy of Sciences recognised the work of Fowler and Baker by the joint award of the Poncelet Prize; Baker received 2000 francs because the prize money was doubled. Ten years later at the formal opening of the first Aswan Dam, for which he was consulting engineer, he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB). He served as president of the Institution of Civil Engineers between May 1895 and June 1896. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1899 and an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1902.

==Underground railways==
Baker also played a large part in the introduction of the system widely adopted in London of constructing underground railways in deep tubular tunnels built up of cast iron segments. He was also involved in an unsuccessful scheme in 1899 proposed by the North West London Railway to build a tube line in north-west London.

==Writing==
Baker was also the author of many papers on engineering subjects. In 1872 Baker wrote a series of articles titled, &quot;The Strength of Brickwork.&quot; In these articles Baker argued that the tensile strength of cement should not be neglected in calculating the strength of brickwork. He wrote that if the cement was neglected then several structures of his time should have collapsed.

==Death==
He died at his home, Bowden Green, in Pangbourne, Berkshire where he lived in his later years and was buried in the village of Idbury in Oxfordshire, next to his mother. He is commemorated in a stained glass window on the northside of the nave at Westminster Abbey.

<text>Thomas Baker (14 September 1656 in Lanchester, Durham – 2 July 1740) was an English antiquarian.

==Life==
He was the grandson of Colonel Baker of Crook, Durham, who won fame in the English Civil War by his defence of Newcastle upon Tyne against the Scots. Thomas was educated at the free school at Durham, and went on to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he later obtained a fellowship. Lord Crew, bishop of Durham, collated him to the rectory of Long Newton in his diocese in 1687, and intended to give him that of Sedgefield with a prebend had not Baker incurred his displeasure by refusing to read James II&#x27;s Declaration of Indulgence. The bishop who himself was afterwards specially excepted from William III&#x27;s Act of Indemnity.

Baker, though he had opposed James, refused to take the oaths to William; he resigned Long Newton on 1 August 1690, and retired to St John&#x27;s, in which he was protected till 20 January 1716/1717, when he and twenty-one others were deprived of their fellowships. After the passing of the Registering Act in 1723, he could not be made to comply with its requirements by registering his annuity of £40, although that annuity, together with £20 per annum from his elder brother&#x27;s collieries, was now his only income. Resentful of the injuries he had suffered, he inscribed himself in all his own books, as well as in those which he gave to the college library, &quot;socius ejectus&quot;, and in some &quot;rector ejectus&quot;. He continued to live in the college as commoner-master till his sudden death from apoplexy. He accumulated a significant library, of books and manuscripts, which was drawn on by contemporary scholars; after his death, it was largely dispersed, though a quantity of books were given to St John&#x27;s.

==Works==
The only works he published were &quot;Reflections on Learning, showing the Insufficiency thereof in its several particulars, in order to evince the usefulness and necessity of Revelation&quot; (London, 1709–1710) and the preface to Bishop Fisher&#x27;s &quot;Funeral Sermon for Margaret, Countess of Richmond and Derby&quot; (1708)—both without his name. His manuscript collections on the history and antiquities of the university of Cambridge, amounting to 39 volumes in folio and three in quarto, were divided between the British Museum and the public library at Cambridge—the former getting twenty-three volumes, the latter sixteen in folio and three in quarto.

The life of Baker was written by Robert Masters (Cambridge 1784), and by Horace Walpole in the quarto edition of his works.

<text>Valentine Baker (1 April 1827 – 17 November 1887), also known as Baker Pasha, was a British general and the younger brother of Sir Samuel Baker. He was most notable for his participation in the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) on the side of the Ottoman Empire.

==Biography==
Baker was educated in Gloucester and in Ceylon, and in 1848 entered the Ceylon Rifles as an ensign. He soon transferred to the 12th Lancers, and saw active service with that regiment in the 8th Cape Frontier War of 1852–1853. In the Crimean War, Baker was present at the Battle of Chernaya River and at the fall of Sevastopol, and in 1859 he became major in the 10th Hussars, succeeding only a year later to the command. This position he held for 13 years, during which period the highest efficiency of his men was reached, and outside the regiment he did good service to his arm by his writings.

He went through the wars of 1866 and 1870 as a spectator with the German armies, and in 1873 he started upon a famous journey through Khorasan with his friend Fred Burnaby. Although he was unable to reach the Khanate of Khiva the results of the journey afforded a great deal of political, geographical and military information, especially as to the advance of Russia in Central Asia.

In 1874, he was back in England and took up a staff appointment at Aldershot.

The following year, Baker&#x27;s career in the British army was ended by a scandal. He was arrested on a charge of indecent assault upon a young woman in a railway carriage. The woman, Rebecca Kate Dickinson, ended up clinging to the outside of the carriage to escape him. The matter went to trial and there was much public interest. Baker offered no defence, and was sentenced to a year&#x27;s imprisonment and a fine of £500. He was then dismissed from the service.

Two years later, having left England, he entered the service of the Ottoman Army in the war with Russia. At first in a high position in the Ottoman Gendarmerie he was soon transferred to Mehmed Ali Pasha&#x27;s staff, and thence took command of a division of infantry. With this division, Baker sustained the rearguard action of Tashkessen against the troops of Iosif Gurko. Promoted Ferik (lieutenant-general) for this feat, he continued to command Suleiman&#x27;s rearguard. After the peace he was employed in an administrative post in Ottoman Armenia, where he remained until 1882. In this year he was offered the command of the newly formed Egyptian Army, which he accepted. On his arrival at Cairo, however, the offer was withdrawn and he obtained command only of the Egyptian police. In this post he devoted by far the greater amount of his energy to the training of the gendarmerie, which he realised would be the reserve of the purely military forces.

When the war in Sudan broke out, Baker, hastening with 3500 men to relieve Tokar, encountered the enemy under Osman Digna at El Teb. His men becoming panic-stricken at the first rush were slaughtered. Baker himself with a few of his officers succeeded by hard fighting in cutting a way out, but his force was annihilated. British troops soon afterwards arrived at Suakin, and Sir Gerald Graham took the offensive. Baker Pasha accompanied the British force, guiding it on its march to the scene of his defeat, and at the desperately fought second battle of El Teb he was wounded.

He remained in command of the Egyptian police until his death in 1887.

==Works==
Among the books he wrote are &quot;Our National Defences&quot; (1860), &quot;War in Bulgaria, a Narrative of Personal Experience&quot; (London, 1879), &quot;Clouds in the East&quot; (London, 1876).

==Family==
He married, on 13 December 1865, Fanny, only child of Frank Wormald of Potterton Hall, Aberford, by which marriage there were two daughters, the younger of whom only survived her father and married Sir John Carden, 5th Baronet.

<text>Tamás Bakócz (, Erdőd, Esztergom) was a Hungarian archbishop, cardinal and statesman. He was a serious candidate in the 1513 papal conclave.

==Life==
Born in Szatmár County, Bakócz was the son of a wagoner and was adopted by his uncle, who trained him for the priesthood and whom he succeeded as rector of Tétel (1480). Through the generosity of his same brother Valentine, he was able to pursue a thorough course of studies first in the town of Szatmár-Németi, then in Cracow, Poland, and finally in the Italian cities of Ferrara and Padua. 

He returned to his native country about the year 1470, with the doctor&#x27;s degree. Bakócz was introduced to the king about the year 1474. Shortly afterwards he became one of the secretaries of King Matthias Corvinus, who made him bishop of Győr and a member of the royal council (1490). Under Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary (1490–1516) he became successively bishop of Eger, the richest of the Hungarian sees, archbishop of Esztergom (1497), cardinal (1500), and titular Latin Patriarch of Constantinople (1510).

From 1490 to his death in 1521 he was the leading statesman of Hungary and mainly responsible for foreign policy. It was solely through his efforts that Hungary did not accede to the league of Cambrai, was consistently friendly with Venice, and formed a family compact with the Habsburgs. He was also the only Magyar prelate who seriously aspired to the papal throne. In 1513, on the death of Julius II, he went to Rome for the express purpose of bringing about his own election as pope. He was received with more than princely pomp, and all but succeeded in his design, thanks to his extraordinary adroitness and the command of an almost unlimited bribing-fund. But Venice and the emperor played him false, and he failed.

He returned to Hungary as papal legate, bringing with him the bull of Leo X proclaiming a fresh crusade against the Turks. But the crusade degenerated into a jacquerie which ravaged the whole kingdom, and much discredited Bakócz. He lost some of his influence at first after the death of Wladislaus, but continued to be the guiding spirit at court, till age and infirmity confined him almost entirely to his house in the last three years of his life. He left a fortune of many millions.

He and his family are buried in a separate chapel of the Esztergom Basilica, the most precious artwork of the Hungarian Renaissance.
