<text>Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE) is a publishing company that has produced role playing, board, miniature, and collectible card games since 1980. Many of ICE&#x27;s better-known products were related to J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s world of Middle-earth, but the &quot;Rolemaster&quot; rules system, and its science-fiction equivalent, &quot;Space Master&quot;, have been the foundation of ICE&#x27;s business.

==History==
===Early years and &quot;Rolemaster&quot;===
Pete Fenlon was running a six-year &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign set in Middle-earth while he was attending college in the late 1970s, when he started developing unique house rules with S. Coleman Charlton and Kurt Fischer. When most of them graduated from the University of Virginia in 1980, they wanted to make a business out of their special game rules, so they founded Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE), named after a regalia from Middle-earth. Aside from Fenlon and Charlton, ICE originally included Richard H. Britton, Terry K. Amthor, Bruce Shelley, Bruce Neidlinger, Kurt Fischer, Heike Kubasch, Olivia Johnston, among others. The company originally only had a few full-time staff, relying on volunteer work from the other founders. But as income increased, it brought more on as employees.

ICE soon published its first three game products: &quot;Arms Law&quot; (1980), &quot;The Iron Wind&quot; (1980), and &quot;&quot; (1981). &quot;Arms Law&quot; was the first release including the house rules from the University of Virginia days, which began &quot;Rolemaster&quot; as an alternate system for combat in &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; rather than a standalone role-playing game. &quot;The Iron Wind&quot; was a campaign for any fantasy role-playing game taking place on a fantastic island, and although it did not receive supplements for years it would come to be considered the first release from ICE in their &quot;Loremaster&quot; campaign setting. &quot;Manassas&quot; by Rick Britton was a wargame set during the American Civil War in the ICE home state of Virginia.

ICE&#x27;s series of rules supplements, beginning with &quot;Arms Law&quot;, were intended to serve as modular add-ons to other RPG systems offering greater detail. &quot;Arms Law&quot; was followed by &quot;Spell Law&quot; (1982), &quot;Character Law&quot; (1982), and &quot;Campaign Law&quot; (1984). In time, these supplements were tied together to form an RPG system of their own, &quot;Rolemaster&quot;. Concurrent with the rules supplements, ICE began releasing world campaign content materials in what was originally called the &quot;Loremaster&quot; series, beginning with &quot;The Iron Wind&quot;.

===&quot;Middle-earth&quot; RPG line and expansion===
&quot;Rolemaster&quot; had originated from a game set in Middle-earth, so ICE sought a license from Tolkien Enterprises to &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, which was granted because no had ever asked them for such a license before. Tolkien Enterprises granted an exclusive, worldwide license to ICE in 1982, and ICE began the Middle-earth line by publishing the sourcebook &quot;A Campaign and Adventure Guidebook for Middle-earth&quot; (1982) which could be used with any fantasy role-playing game. According to some interpretations, at the time of its publication ICE&#x27;s &quot;Middle-earth Role Playing&quot; was the second best selling fantasy RPG after TSR&#x27;s &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.

ICE then added the science fiction RPGs &quot;Spacemaster&quot; (1985) and &quot;Cyberspace&quot; (1989) to its line. ICE also published a moderately successful space miniatures battle game called &quot;Silent Death&quot; (1990), based on &quot;Spacemaster&quot; but with simpler mechanics. &quot;Silent Death&quot; was released in two major editions, with supplemental books and a fair number of paintable lead miniatures. ICE also expanded its original &quot;Loremaster&quot; supplements into a full-blown fantasy world to support &quot;Rolemaster&quot;, called the &quot;Shadow World&quot;, supported by dozens of adventures and sourcebooks. In 1986, ICE signed a publication contract to take over Hero Games&#x27; production and distribution. Later, with Hero Games staff leaving for other jobs, ICE took over the creative reins of Hero&#x27;s products.

Iron Crown branched out into the solo gaming books under the &quot;Tolkien Quest&quot; (later called &quot;Middle-earth Quest&quot;, 1985), &quot;Sherlock Holmes Solo Mysteries&quot; (1987) and &quot;Narnia Solo Games&quot; (1988) book lines. Unknown to ICE at the time, the &quot;Middle-earth Quest&quot; books violated ICE and Tolkien Enterprises&#x27; contract with Tolkien&#x27;s book publishing licensee, George Allen &amp; Unwin. ICE and TE considered the books to be games and under their license, but the format came too close to being literary books. ICE was forced to recall and destroy the whole line of books, at devastating cost. Meanwhile, ICE sued the Narnia licensor as they turned out to not have the necessary rights to license Narnia to ICE. That company went bankrupt from the legal settlement and was unable to pay ICE their damages. ICE reached terms in 1988 for a gamebook license with the estate of J.R.R. Tolkien and George Allen &amp; Unwin for four new Middle-earth Quest books, beginning with &quot;A Spy in Isengard&quot;. However, the solo game book market was going soft by this time. ICE canceled all solo game book lines, with dozens of books still in development. Returns were high on the &quot;Sherlock Holmes Solo Mysteries&quot; line. All this brought ICE to near bankruptcy in a &quot;voluntary-type of receivership&quot;.

===&quot;Middle-earth CCG&quot; and demise===
With the rise of collectible card games, ICE released &quot;Middle-earth Collectible Card Game&quot; (1995) and &quot;Warlords&quot; CCG (1997). In 1997, ICE bailed out Mayfair Games, a publisher well known for the &quot;Settlers of Catan&quot; board game.

Despite ICE&#x27;s many successes and overcoming many setbacks over 17 years, in 1997 ICE suffered financial difficulties from a rapid decline in its distribution net; nearly 70% of ICE&#x27;s distributors either went bankrupt or became moribund. There has been some debate over whether Tolkien Enterprises forced ICE into bankruptcy in order to get the gaming license in anticipation of the upcoming new movie franchise.

The company entered bankruptcy and filed for Chapter 7 in October, 2000. This bankruptcy cost ICE the Middle-earth license, ending both the &quot;MERP&quot; and &quot;MECCG&quot; lines. Many of the authors and illustrators were not paid for substantial amounts of work.

===Aurigas Aldebaron===

In December, 2001, ICE&#x27;s assets were purchased by Aurigas Aldebaron LLLC, an intellectual property ownership company backed by several wealthy individuals. The new owners licensed the Iron Crown Enterprise name and other assets to Mjolnir LLC until 2011. Starting in January, 2011, licensing was transferred to Guild Companion Publications Ltd.

In 2016, Aurigas Alderbaron merged with Guild Companion Publications Ltd to create a single company: Guild Companion Publications. This company both holds the Iron Crown Enterprises intellectual property and produces and sells Iron Crown products.

On January 9, 2017, Guild Companion Publications Limited officially changed its name to Iron Crown Enterprises Ltd.

===Iron Crown Enterprises Ltd===
Iron Crown Enterprises continues to produce products for its &quot;Rolemaster&quot; and &quot;High Adventure Role Playing (HARP)&quot; line, including products set in the Shadow World.

<text>The Peoples Temple of the Disciples of Christ, originally Peoples Temple Full Gospel Church and commonly shortened to Peoples Temple, was an American cult which existed between 1954 and 1978 and was affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Founded by Jim Jones in Indianapolis, Indiana, the Peoples Temple spread a message that combined elements of Christianity with communist and socialist ideology, with an emphasis on racial equality. After Jones moved the group to California in the 1960s and established several locations throughout the state, including its headquarters in San Francisco, the Temple forged ties with many left-wing political figures and claimed to have 20,000 members (though 3,000–5,000 is more likely).

The Temple is best known for the events of November 18, 1978, in Guyana, when 909 people died in a mass suicide and mass murder at its remote settlement, named &quot;Jonestown&quot;, as well as the murders of U.S. Congressman Leo Ryan and members of his visiting delegation at the nearby Port Kaituma airstrip. The incident at Jonestown resulted in the greatest single loss of American civilian life in a deliberate act prior to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Because of the killings in Guyana, the Temple is regarded by scholars and by popular view as a destructive cult.

==Before California==
===Indiana formation===

Before he founded his church, Jim Jones had become interested in communism and frustrated by the targeting of communists in the U.S. during the Red Scare. This, among other things, provided a clerical inspiration for Jones; as he himself described it in a biographical recording:
Although Jones feared that he would end up being the victim of a backlash for being a communist, he was surprised when a Methodist superintendent helped him enter the church, despite his knowledge that Jones was a communist. In 1952, Jones became a student pastor in Sommerset Southside Methodist Church in Indianapolis, Indiana, but left that church because it barred him from integrating African-Americans into his congregation. In 1954, Jones founded his own church in a rented space in Indianapolis, at first, he named it the Community Unity Church.

Jones had previously observed a faith healing service at the Seventh Day Baptist Church, which led him to conclude that such healings could attract people, and generate income, which he could use to accomplish his social goals. Jones and the Temple&#x27;s members knowingly faked healings because they found that the healings increased people&#x27;s faith and generated financial resources which they could use to help the poor and finance the church. These &quot;healings&quot; involved the use of chicken livers and other animal tissue, which Jones (and confederate Temple members) claimed were cancerous tissues which had been removed from the bodies of the people who had been healed.

In 1955, Jones bought his first church building, located in a racially mixed Indianapolis neighborhood. He first named his church Wings of Deliverance, and later that year, he renamed it the Peoples Temple Full Gospel Church, the first time he used the phrase &quot;Peoples Temple&quot;. Jones&#x27;s healings and purported clairvoyant revelations attracted spiritualists.

===Latter Rain Movement===
Jones began closely associating with the Independent Assemblies of God (IAoG), an international group of churches who embraced the Latter Rain movement. The IAoG had few requirements for ordaining ministers and were accepting of divine healing practices. In June 1955, Jones held his first joint meetings with William Branham, a healing evangelist and Pentecostal leader in the global Healing Revival.

In 1956, Jones was ordained as an IAoG minister by Joseph Mattsson-Boze, a leader in the Latter Rain movement and the IAoG. Jones quickly rose to prominence in the group. Working with the IAoG, Jones organized and hosted a healing convention to take place from June 11 to June 15, 1956, in Indianapolis&#x27;s Cadle Tabernacle. Needing a well-known figure to draw crowds, he arranged to share the pulpit again with Reverend Branham.

Branham was known to tell supplicants their name, address, and why they came for prayer, before pronouncing them healed. Jones was intrigued by Branham&#x27;s methods and began performing the same feats. Jones and Branham&#x27;s meetings were very successful and attracted an audience of 11,000 at their first joint campaign. At the convention, Branham issued a prophetic endorsement of Jones and his ministry, saying that God used the convention to send forth a new great ministry.

Many attendees in the campaign believed Jones&#x27;s performance indicated that he possessed a supernatural gift, and coupled with Branham&#x27;s endorsement, it led to rapid growth of Peoples Temple. Jones was particularly effective at recruitment among the African American attendees at the conventions. According to a newspaper report, regular attendance at Peoples Temple swelled to 1,000 thanks to the publicity Branham provided to Jones and Peoples Temple.

Following the convention, Jones renamed his church the &quot;Peoples Temple Christian Church Full Gospel&quot; to associate it with Full Gospel Pentecostalism; the name was later shortened to the Peoples Temple. Jones participated in a series of multi-state revival campaigns with Branham and Mattsson-Boze in the second half of the 1950s, making multiple joint appearances with them. Jones claimed to be a follower and promoter of Branham&#x27;s &quot;Message&quot; during the period. Peoples Temple hosted a second international Pentecostal convention in 1957 which was again headlined by Branham. Through the conventions and with the support of Branham and Mattsson-Boze, Jones secured connections throughout the Latter Rain movement.

===Indianapolis expansion===
Jones used the convention meetings with other Pentecostal speakers to gain wide publicity, and Jim Jones continued to disguise the fact that he was using religion to further his political ideology. Those conventions drew as many as 11,000 attendees, as James Warren Jones and the other preachers conducted &quot;healings&quot; and impressed attendees by revealing private information—usually addresses, phone numbers, or Social Security numbers, which private detectives could easily discover beforehand. Jones and Temple members also drove through various cities in Indiana and Ohio on recruiting and fundraising efforts.

The Temple stressed egalitarian ideals, asking members to attend in casual clothes so poor members would not feel out of place, and providing shelter for the needy. While the Temple had increased its African-American membership from 15% to nearly 50%, in order to attempt further gains the Temple hired African-American preacher Archie Ijames (who had earlier given up organized religion). Pastor Ijames was one of the first to commit to Jones&#x27;s socialist collective program. In 1959, the church joined the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), and was renamed the Peoples Temple Christian Church Full Gospel. This affiliation was a successful attempt to both raise the dwindling membership and restore the reputation of the organization.

In February 1960, the Temple opened a soup kitchen for the poor and expanded their social services to include rent assistance, job placement services, free canned goods, clothing, and coal for winter heating. Jones and his wife Marceline helped to increase the Temple&#x27;s soup kitchen service to an average of about 2,800 meals per month. The Temple&#x27;s public profile was further elevated when Jones was appointed to the Indianapolis Human Rights Commission. He engaged in public attempts to integrate businesses and was the subject of much local media coverage.

===Changes and &quot;religious communalism&quot;===
Jones had read extensively about Father Divine, the founder of the International Peace Mission movement. Jones and members of the Temple visited Divine several times, while Jones studied his writings and tape recordings of his sermons. The Temple printed Divine&#x27;s texts for its members and began to preach that members should abstain from sex and only adopt children.

In 1959, Jones tested the new fiery rhetorical style that Divine had used in a sermon. His speech captivated members with lulls and crescendos, as Jones challenged individual members in front of the group. The speech also marked the beginning of the Temple&#x27;s underlying &quot;us versus them&quot; message. Jones carefully wove in that the Temple&#x27;s home for senior citizens was established on the basis &quot;From each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot;, quoting Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;Critique of the Gotha Program&quot;. He did so knowing that his Christian audience would recognize the similarities with text from the Acts of the Apostles (4:34–35) which stated: &quot;distribution was made to each as any had need.&quot; Jones would repeatedly cite that passage to paint Jesus as a communist, while at the same time attacking much of the text of the Bible.

The Temple began tightening control over its organization, asking more of its members than did other churches. It required that members spend Thanksgiving and Christmas with its Temple &quot;family&quot; rather than with blood relatives, the beginning of a process to wean members from outside contact and redirect their lives toward a total commitment to the Temple and its goals. Jones began to offer a deal towards a socialist collective, which he called &quot;religious communalism&quot;, in which members would donate their material possessions to the Temple in exchange for the Temple meeting all those members&#x27; needs. Pastor James was one of the first to commit.

The Temple had little luck converting most Midwesterners to communist ideals, even when disguised as religion. Admiring the 1959 Cuban Revolution, Jones traveled to the island nation in 1960 in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade poor black Cubans to move to his congregation in Indiana. The Temple&#x27;s religious message transitioned during this period, to one treading between atheism and the subtle notion that Jones was a Christ-like figure. While Temple aides complained privately, Jones said that the new message was needed to foster members&#x27; dedication to the Temple&#x27;s larger goals. He maintained such implications until the mid-to-late 1970s.

In 1961, Jones claimed he had had a vision in which Indianapolis and Chicago were destroyed in a nuclear attack, convincing aides that the Temple needed to look for a new location. A 1962 &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine article listed the nine safest places to be in a nuclear war, with Belo Horizonte, Brazil, topping the list because of its location and atmospheric conditions. Jones traveled through Brazil from 1962 through early 1963. He requested money from the Temple while in Rio de Janeiro, but the Temple lacked adequate funds for such a request because of shrinking finances in Jones&#x27;s absence. Jones sent a preacher that had become a follower in Brazil back to Indiana to help stabilize the Temple. Jones returned to Indiana in 1963.

==In California==

===Moving Peoples Temple===
Jones returned from Brazil in December 1963 to find Peoples Temple bitterly divided. Financial issues and a much smaller congregation forced Jones to sell the Peoples Temple church building and relocate to a smaller building nearby. To raise money, Jones briefly returned to the revival circuit, traveling and holding healing campaigns. After dealing with the issues at Peoples Temple, and possibly in part to distract from them, he told his Indiana congregation that the world would be engulfed by nuclear war on July 15, 1967, leading to a new socialist Eden on Earth, and that the Temple must move to Northern California for safety.

With Jones&#x27;s return, the majority of his congregation gradually returned to Peoples Temple, improving their financial situation. During 1964 Jones made multiple trips to California to locate a suitable location to relocate. In July 1965, Jones and his followers began moving to their new location in Redwood Valley, California, near the city of Ukiah. Jones&#x27;s assistant pastor, Russell Winberg, strongly resisted Jones&#x27;s efforts to move the congregation and warned members of Peoples Temple that Jones was abandoning Christianity.

Winberg took over leadership of the Indianapolis church when Jones departed. About 140 of Jones&#x27;s most loyal followers made the move to California, while the rest remained behind with Winberg.

In California, Jones was able to use his education degree from Butler University to secure a job as a history and government teacher at an adult education school in Ukiah. Jones used his position to recruit for Peoples Temple, teaching his students the benefits of Marxism and lecturing on religion. Jones planted loyal members of Peoples Temple in the classes to help him with recruitment. His efforts were successful, and Jones recruited 50 new members to Peoples Temple in the first few months. In 1967, Jones&#x27;s followers persuaded another 75 members of the Indianapolis congregation to move to California.

In 1968, the Peoples Temple&#x27;s California location was admitted to the Disciples of Christ. Jones began to use the denominational connection to promote Peoples Temple as part of the 1.5 million member denomination. He played up famous members of the Disciples, including Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover, and misrepresented the nature of his position in the denomination. By 1969, Jones increased the membership in Peoples Temple in California to 300.

===Apostolic Socialism===
Jones developed a theology that was significantly influenced by the teachings of the Latter Rain movement, William Branham, Father Divine, and infused with Jones&#x27;s personal communist worldview. Jones referred to his belief as &quot;Apostolic Socialism&quot;. Following the relocation of Peoples Temple to California, Jones began to gradually introduce the concepts to his followers. According to religious studies professor Catherine Wessinger, Jones always spoke of the Social Gospel&#x27;s virtues, but chose to conceal that his gospel was actually communism until he began to do so in sermons at the Temple in the late 1960s.

Jones taught that &quot;those who remained drugged with the opiate of religion had to be brought to enlightenment&quot;, which he defined as socialism. Jones asserted that traditional Christianity had an incorrect view of God. By the early 1970s, Jones began deriding traditional Christianity as &quot;fly away religion&quot;, rejecting the Bible as being a tool to oppress women and non-whites. Jones referred to traditional Christianity&#x27;s view of God as a &quot;Sky God&quot; who was &quot;no God at all&quot;. Instead, Jones claimed to be following the true God who created all things.

Jones taught that ultimate reality was called the &quot;Divine Principle&quot;, and this principle was the true God. Jones equated the principle with love, and he equated love with socialism. Jones asserted he was a savior sent by the true God, to rescue humanity from their sufferings. Jones insisted that accepting the &quot;Divine Principle&quot; was equivalent to being &quot;crucified with Christ&quot;.

Jones increasingly promoted the idea of his own divinity, going so far as to tell his congregation that &quot;I am come as God Socialist.&quot; Jones carefully avoided claiming divinity outside of Peoples Temple, but he expected to be acknowledged as god-like among his followers. Former Temple member Hue Fortson Jr. quoted him as saying:

What you need to believe in is what you can see... If you see me as your friend, I&#x27;ll be your friend. As you see me as your father, I&#x27;ll be your father, for those of you that don&#x27;t have a father... If you see me as your savior, I&#x27;ll be your savior. If you see me as your God, I&#x27;ll be your God.

Further attacking traditional Christianity, Jones authored and circulated a tract entitled &quot;The Letter Killeth&quot;, criticizing the King James Bible, and dismissing King James as a slave owner and a capitalist who was responsible for the corrupt translation of scripture. Jones claimed he was sent to share the true meaning of the gospel which had been hidden by corrupt leaders.

Jones rejected even the few required tenets of the Disciples of Christ denomination. Instead of implementing the sacraments as prescribed by the Disciples, Jones followed Father Divine&#x27;s holy communion practices. Jones created his own baptismal formula, baptizing his converts &quot;in the holy name of Socialism&quot;.

While in the United States, Jones remained fearful of the public discovering the full extent of his communist views. He believed that if the true nature of his views became widely known, he would quickly lose the support of political leaders and even face the possibility of Peoples Temple being ejected from the Disciples of Christ. Jones also feared losing the church&#x27;s tax-exempt status and having to report his financial dealings to the Internal Revenue Service. Jones took care to always couch his socialist views in religious terms, such as &quot;apostolic social justice&quot;. &quot;Living the Acts of the Apostles&quot; was his euphemism for living a communal lifestyle.

Jones frequently warned his followers of an imminent apocalyptic genocidal race war and nuclear war. He claimed that Nazi fascists and white supremacists would put people of color into concentration camps. Jones said he was a messiah sent to save people by giving them a place of refuge in his church. Drawing on a prophecy in the Book of Revelation, he taught that American capitalist culture was irredeemable &quot;Babylon&quot;. Explaining the nature of sin, Jones stated, &quot;If you&#x27;re born in capitalist America, racist America, fascist America, then you&#x27;re born in sin. But if you&#x27;re born in socialism, you&#x27;re not born in sin.&quot; He taught his followers the only way to escape the supposed imminent catastrophe was to accept his teachings, and that after the apocalypse was over, they would emerge to establish a perfect communist society.

Historians are divided over whether Jones actually believed his own teachings, or was just using them to manipulate people. Jeff Guinn said, &quot;It is impossible to know whether Jones gradually came to think he was God&#x27;s earthly vessel, or whether he came to that convenient conclusion&quot; to enhance his authority over his followers. In a 1976 phone conversation with John Maher, Jones admitted to be an agnostic and an atheist. Marceline admitted in a 1977 &quot;New York Times&quot; interview that Jones was trying to promote Marxism in the U.S. by mobilizing people through religion, citing Mao Zedong as his inspiration: &quot;Jim used religion to try to get some people out of the opiate of religion.&quot; She told the reporter that Jones had once slammed the Bible on the table yelling &quot;I&#x27;ve got to destroy this paper idol!&quot; Jones taught his followers that the ends justify the means and authorized them to achieve his vision by any means necessary. Outsiders would later point to this aspect of Jones&#x27;s teachings to allege that he did not genuinely believe in his own teachings and that he was &quot;morally bankrupt&quot; and only manipulating religion and other elements of society &quot;to achieve his own selfish ends&quot;.

Jones began using illicit drugs after moving to California, which further heightened his paranoia. Jones increasingly used fear to control and manipulate his followers in California. Jones frequently warned his followers that there was an enemy seeking to destroy them. The identity of that enemy changed over time from the Ku Klux Klan, to Nazis, to redneck vigilantes, and finally the American government. He frequently prophesied that fires, car accidents, and death or injuries would come upon anyone unfaithful to him and his teachings. He constantly told his followers that they needed to be crusaders in promoting and fulfilling his beliefs.

Through his tactics, he successfully implemented a communal lifestyle among his followers that was directed by him and his lieutenants who were part of a committee called the Planning Commission. Jones, through the Planning Commission, began controlling all aspects of the lives of his followers. Members who joined Peoples Temple were required to turn over all their assets to the church in exchange for free room and board. Many members working outside of the Temple were also required to turn over all their income to be used for the benefit of the community. Jones directed groups of his followers to work on various projects to earn income for the People Temple and set up an agricultural operation in Redwood Valley to grow food. Jones organized large community outreach projects, taking his followers by bus to perform work community service across the region.

The first known cases of serious abuse in Peoples Temple arose in California as the Planning Commission carried out discipline against members who were not fulfilling Jones&#x27;s vision or following the rules. Jones&#x27;s control over the members of Peoples Temple extended to their sex lives and who could be married. Some members were coerced to get abortions. Jones began to require sexual favors from the wives of some members of the church. Jones also raped several male members of his congregation.

Members who rebelled against Jones&#x27;s control were punished with reduced food rations, harsher work schedules, public ridicule and humiliations, and sometimes with physical violence. As the Temple&#x27;s membership grew, Jones created a security group to ensure order among his followers and to ensure his own personal safety. The group purchased security squad cars and armed their guards with rifles and pistols.

===Urban expansion===
Because of limited expansion in the Redwood Valley-Ukiah area, it eventually seemed necessary to move the church&#x27;s seat of power to an urban area. In 1970, the Temple began holding services in San Francisco and Los Angeles. It established permanent facilities in those cities in 1971 and 1972, respectively. In San Francisco, the Temple occupied a former Scottish Rite temple at 1859 Geary Boulevard in the Fillmore District. At the time, the Fillmore district was a majority Black neighborhood and a stronghold of Black culture on the West Coast. In Los Angeles, the Temple occupied the former building of the First Church of Christ, Scientist at 1366 S. Alvarado Street.

By 1972, the Temple called Redwood Valley the &quot;mother church&quot; of a &quot;statewide political movement&quot;. From the start, the Los Angeles facility&#x27;s primary purposes were to recruit members and to serve as a waystation for the Temple&#x27;s weekly bus trips across California. The Temple set up permanent staff in Los Angeles and arranged bus trips there every other week. The substantial attendance and collections in Los Angeles helped support the Temple&#x27;s inflated membership claims. The Los Angeles facility was larger than San Francisco&#x27;s. Its central location at the corner of Alvarado and Hoover Streets permitted easy geographic access for a large black membership from Watts and Compton.

Recruiting drives in Los Angeles and San Francisco helped increase membership in the Temple from a few hundred to nearly 3,000 by the mid-1970s. Later, when the Temple&#x27;s headquarters shifted from Redwood Valley to San Francisco, the Temple convinced many Los Angeles members to move north to its new headquarters.

===Organizational structure===

Although some descriptions of the Peoples Temple emphasize Jones&#x27;s autocratic control over its operations, in reality, the Temple possessed a complex leadership structure with decision-making power unevenly dispersed among its members. Within that structure, Temple members were unwittingly and gradually subjected to sophisticated mind control and behavior modification techniques borrowed from post-revolutionary China and North Korea. The Temple tightly defined psychological boundaries that &quot;enemies&quot;, such as &quot;traitors&quot; to the Temple, crossed at their own peril. While the secrecy and caution Jones demanded in recruiting led to decreased overall membership, they also helped him foster hero-worship of himself as the &quot;ultimate socialist&quot;.

In the 1970s, the Temple established a more formal hierarchy for its socialistic model. At the top were the Temple&#x27;s staff, a select group of predominantly college-educated white women that undertook the Temple&#x27;s most sensitive missions. They necessarily acclimated themselves to an &quot;ends justify the means&quot; philosophy. The earliest member was Sandy Bradshaw, a socialist from Syracuse, New York. Others included Carolyn Layton, a communist since the age of 15 who had a child with Jones; Sharon Amos, who worked for the social services department; Patty Cartmell, Jones&#x27;s secretary; and Teri Buford, a Navy brat turned pacifist. The group was often scorned as elitist within the egalitarian Temple organization and viewed as secret police.

The Temple&#x27;s Planning Commission was its governing board. Membership quickly ballooned from 50 to over 100. During the week, members convened for meetings in various Redwood Valley locations, sometimes until dawn. The Planning Commission was responsible for the Temple&#x27;s day-to-day operations, including key decision-making, financial and legal planning, and oversight. The Commission sat over various other committees, such as the Diversions Committee, which carried out tasks such as writing huge numbers of letters to politicians from fictional people mailed from various locations around the U.S., and the Mertles Committee, which undertook activities against defectors Al and Jeannie Mills.

A group of rank-and-file members, whom outsiders called the &quot;troops&quot;, consisted of working-class members who were 70–80% black. They set up chairs for meetings, filled offering boxes, and did other tasks. Many of them were attracted to the Temple&#x27;s quasi-socialist approach both because of the Temple&#x27;s political education offers and because the Temple&#x27;s highly passionate congregations still maintained the familiar forms of evangelical prayers and black gospels. Jones also surrounded himself with several dozen mostly white, privileged members in their twenties and thirties who had skills in law, accounting, nursing, teaching, music, and administration. This latter group carried out public relations, financial duties, and more mundane chores while bringing in good salaries from well-paying outside jobs.

===Recruiting, faith healings, and fund raising===
The Temple used ten to fifteen Greyhound-type bus cruisers to transport members up and down California freeways each week for recruitment and fundraising. Jones always rode in bus number seven, which contained armed guards and a special section lined with protective metal plates. He told members that the Temple would not bother scheduling a trip unless it could net $100,000, and the Temple&#x27;s goal for annual net income from bus trips was $1 million.

Beginning in the 1970s, the bus caravan also traveled across the U.S. quarterly, including to Washington, D.C. In June 1973, Representative George Brown, Jr. entered a lengthy and laudatory description of the Temple into the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ran an August 18, 1973, editorial-page item stating that the 660 Temple visitors were the &quot;hands down winners of anybody&#x27;s tourists of the year award&quot; after spending an hour cleaning up the Capitol grounds.

The Temple distributed pamphlets in cities along the route of these fundraising trips bragging of Jones&#x27;s prowess at &quot;spiritual healing&quot; without mentioning the Temple&#x27;s Marxist goals. Stops included large cities such as Houston, Detroit, and Cleveland. Temple members pretended to be locals and acted as shills in the various faked healings and &quot;revelations&quot;. Local viewers did not realize they were in the minority in the audience. The weekly take from offerings and healing services was $15,000 to $25,000 in Los Angeles and $8,000 to $12,000 in San Francisco. There were smaller collections from trips around the &quot;mother church&quot; in Redwood Valley.

The Temple also set up Truth Enterprises, a direct mailing branch that sent out 30,000 to 50,000 mailers monthly to people who had attended Temple services or written to the Temple after listening to Temple radio programs. Donations were mailed in from all over the continental U.S., Hawaii, South America, and Europe. In addition to receiving donations, the Temple sold trinkets, such as pieces of Jones&#x27;s robes, healing oil, Temple rings, key chains, and lockets. In peak periods, mailer revenue grossed $300 to $400 daily. This figure even surprised Jones.

Although Jones had earlier asked Temple members to destroy photos of him because he did not want members worshiping him as Catholics &quot;worshiped plaster statues&quot;, Jeannie and Al Mills (who would later defect) convinced Jones to sell anointed and blessed photos to raise money. Jones worried that &quot;they&#x27;re gonna get me for mail fraud someday.&quot; In 1973, the Temple also formed Brotherhood Records, a subsidiary record label that produced music from the Temple&#x27;s &quot;large interracial youth choir and orchestra&quot;.

===Size and scope===

Despite exaggerated claims by the Temple of 20,000 or more members, one source claims its greatest actual registered membership was around 3,000. However, 5,000 individual membership card photos were located in Temple records after its dissolution. Regardless of its official membership, the Temple also regularly drew 3,000 people to its San Francisco services alone. Of particular interest to politicians was the Temple&#x27;s ability to produce 2,000 people for campaign work or attendance in San Francisco on only six hours&#x27; notice.

By the mid-1970s, in addition to its locations in Redwood Valley, Los Angeles and San Francisco, the Temple had established satellite congregations in almost a dozen other California cities. Jones mentioned locations in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Ukiah, Bakersfield, Fresno, and Sacramento. The Temple also maintained a branch, college tuition program, and dormitory at Santa Rosa Junior College.

At the same time, Jones and his church earned a reputation for aiding the cities&#x27; poorest citizens, especially racial minorities, drug addicts, and the homeless. The Temple made strong connections to the California state welfare system. During the 1970s, the church owned and ran at least nine residential care homes for the elderly, six homes for foster children, and a state-licensed ranch for developmentally disabled persons. The Temple elite handled members&#x27; insurance claims and legal problems, effectively acting as a client-advocacy group. For these reasons, sociologist John Hall described the Temple as a &quot;charismatic bureaucracy&quot;, oriented toward Jones as a charismatic leader, but functioning as a bureaucratic social service organization.

===Kinsolving series===
In 1972, the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; and the &quot;Indianapolis Star&quot; ran the first four parts of a seven-part story on the Temple by Lester Kinsolving, its first public exposé. Kinsolving reported on several aspects of church dealings, its claims of healings, and Jones&#x27;s ritual of throwing Bibles down in church, yelling, &quot;This black book has held down you people for 2,000 years. It has no power.&quot; Temple members picketed the &quot;Examiner&quot;, harassed the paper&#x27;s editor, and threatened both the &quot;Examiner&quot; and the &quot;Star&quot; with libel suits. Both papers canceled the series after the fourth installment. Shortly thereafter, Jones made grants to newspapers in California with the stated goal of supporting the First Amendment.

===Defections===
Some defections occurred, most especially in 1973, when eight young members known as the &quot;Gang of Eight&quot; defected together. Because the Gang of Eight were aware of threats to potential defectors, they suspected Jones would send a search party to look for them. Their fears proved correct: Jones employed multiple search parties, including one which scanned highways from a rented airplane. The Gang of Eight drove three trucks loaded with firearms toward Canada, avoiding U.S. Highway 101. Because they feared taking firearms over the U.S.–Canada border, the group traveled instead to the hills of Montana, where they wrote a long letter documenting their complaints.

Former Temple member Jeannie Mills later wrote that Jones called thirty members to his home and forebodingly declared that, in light of the mass defection, &quot;in order to keep our apostolic socialism, we should all kill ourselves and leave a note saying that because of harassment, a socialist group cannot exist at this time.&quot; Jones became furious, waving a pistol at the Planning Commission and referring to the Gang of Eight as &quot;Trotskyite defectors&quot; and &quot;Coca-Cola revolutionaries&quot;. While the Temple did not execute the suicide plan Jones described, it did conduct fake suicide rituals in the years that followed.

==San Francisco Temple==

The move to San Francisco permitted Jones to be more open with his true political and theological leanings. By spring 1976, Jones openly admitted even to outsiders that he was an atheist. Despite the Temple&#x27;s fear that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was investigating its religious tax exemption, Marceline admitted to &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1977 that her husband, taking inspiration from Mao Zedong, was trying to achieve social change by mobilizing people through religion. She admitted that, &quot;Jim used religion to try to get some people out of the opiate of religion&quot; and had slammed the Bible on the table yelling, &quot;I&#x27;ve got to destroy this paper idol!&quot;

With the move into San Francisco, the Temple more strenuously emphasized that its members live communally. It stressed physical discipline of children first, and then adults. The San Francisco Temple also carefully vetted newcomers through an extensive observation process.

The Temple distinguished itself from most new religious movements with its overtly political message. It combined those genuine political sympathies with the perception that it could help turn out large numbers of votes to gain the support of a number of prominent politicians. Jones made it known after he moved to San Francisco that he was interested in politics, and legal changes in the way San Francisco elections were held strengthened the power of neighborhood groups and civic organizations such as the Temple.

After the Temple&#x27;s voter mobilization efforts proved instrumental in state Senate President George Moscone&#x27;s run for mayor of San Francisco in 1975, he appointed Jones as Chairman of the San Francisco Housing Authority Commission. Jones and the Temple received the support of California political figures such as Moscone, Governor Jerry Brown, Congressman Mervyn Dymally, state Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, Assemblyman Art Agnos, and Supervisor Harvey Milk. Willie Brown visited the Temple numerous times and spoke publicly in support of Jones, even after investigations and suspicions of cult activity. Jones and Moscone met privately with Presidential nominee Jimmy Carter&#x27;s then-running mate, U.S. Senator Walter Mondale in San Francisco days before the 1976 presidential election. Jones also met First Lady Rosalynn Carter on multiple occasions, including a private dinner, and corresponded with her in letters.

Jones used his position at the Housing Authority to lead the fight against the eviction of tenants from San Francisco&#x27;s International Hotel. The Temple further forged an alliance with San Francisco&#x27;s Black community newspaper, the &quot;Sun Reporter&quot; publisher Dr. Carlton Goodlett and it received frequent favorable mentions in that paper. It also received frequent favorable coverage from &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; columnist Herb Caen and other local newspaper and television reporters.

However, the Temple aroused police suspicion after Jones praised the Symbionese Liberation Army, a radical Bay Area group, and the SLA&#x27;s leaders attended San Francisco Temple meetings. Further suspicions were raised after the defection of Joyce Shaw and the mysterious death soon after of her husband, Bob Houston.

In 1974 a fire broke out at Peoples Temple&#x27;s San Francisco location. Without evidence Jones speculated that members of the Nation of Islam may have started the fire. Jones sent several of his followers to a nearby mosque to issue a warning to their group. This began a period of heightened tensions between Peoples Temple and the Nation of Islam. Gradually, Jones worked to improve relations with the Nation of Islam, culminating a joint &quot;Spiritual Jubilee&quot; rally held at the Los Angeles Convention Center in May 1976. He used the event to garner positive publicity, and the joint rally was attended by many of his closest political acquaintances. At the rally, Jones called for peace and unity saying, &quot;if the Peoples Temple and the Nation of Islam can get together, anyone can.&quot; Jones ended by pledging support to the Muslim community and declared his desire for Wallace Muhammad to run for President of the United States.

While the Temple forged media alliances, the move to San Francisco also opened the group to media scrutiny. When Jones and hundreds of Temple members moved to the Temple&#x27;s Guyana settlement following media investigations, Mayor Moscone issued a press release stating that his office would not investigate the Temple. During this time, Milk spoke at Temple political rallies and wrote a letter to President Jimmy Carter after the investigations began, in which he accused Timothy Stoen, who by that point had defected from the Temple and was attempting to extricate relatives from Guyana, of telling &quot;bold-faced lies&quot;.

==Mass murder/suicide at Jonestown, Guyana==
In 1974, the Peoples Temple signed a lease to rent land in Guyana. The community which was established on this piece of property was named the Peoples Temple Agricultural Project, informally dubbed &quot;Jonestown&quot;. The settlement had as few as fifty residents in early 1977.

Jones saw Jonestown as both a &quot;socialist paradise&quot; and a &quot;sanctuary&quot; from media scrutiny that had started with the Kinsolving articles. Former Temple member Tim Carter said the Temple moved to Jonestown because &quot;in &#x27;74, what we saw in the United States was creeping fascism.&quot; Carter explained, &quot;It was apparent that corporations, or the multinationals, were getting much larger, their influence was growing within the government, and the United States is a racist place.&quot; He said the Temple concluded that Guyana was &quot;a place in a black country where our black members could live in peace&quot;, &quot;it was a socialist government&quot; and it was &quot;the only English-speaking country in South America.&quot;

Increasing media scrutiny based on allegations by former members placed further pressure on Jones, especially after a 1977 article by Marshall Kilduff in &quot;New West&quot; magazine. Just before publication of the &quot;New West&quot; piece, editor Rosalie Wright telephoned Jones to read him the article. Wright explained that she was only doing so before publication because of &quot;all the support letters we received on your behalf, from the Governor of California [Jerry Brown]&quot; and others.

While still on the phone listening to the allegations contained in the article, Jones wrote a note to Temple members in the room with him that said, &quot;We leave tonight. Notify Georgetown (Guyana).&quot; After Jones left for Guyana, he encouraged Temple members to follow him there. The population grew to about a thousand people by late 1978. Those who moved there were promised a tropical paradise free from the supposed wickedness of the outside world.

On November 17, 1978, Representative Leo Ryan, who was investigating claims of abuse within the Temple, visited Jonestown. During his visit, a number of Temple members expressed a desire to leave with him, and, on November 18, some accompanied Ryan to the local airstrip at Port Kaituma. There they were intercepted by Temple security guards who opened fire on the group, killing Ryan, three journalists, and one of the defectors as well as injuring nine others, including Ryan&#x27;s aide, Jackie Speier. A few seconds of gunfire from the incident were captured on video by NBC cameraman Bob Brown, one of the journalists killed in the attack. Though she was shot five times, including suffering a massive leg wound, Speier survived and won a seat in Congress in 2008, serving until she declined to run for reelection in 2022. That evening, in Jonestown, Jones ordered his congregation to drink a concoction of cyanide-laced, grape-flavored Flavor Aid. In all, 918 people died, including 276 children. This includes four that died at the Temple headquarters that night in the Guyanese capital of Georgetown. Some members resisted committing &quot;revolutionary suicide,&quot; and were injected with fatal doses of cyanide, as were infants, and others survived by fleeing through the jungle. Jones himself, as well as his personal aide Annie Moore, died of (likely) self-inflicted gunshot wounds. It was the greatest single loss of American civilian life in a deliberate act until the events of September 11, 2001.

===Aftermath===


The Temple&#x27;s San Francisco headquarters was besieged by the national media and the relatives of the Jonestown victims. The mass killing became one of the best-known events in U.S. history as measured by the Gallup poll and appeared on the cover of several newspapers and magazines, including &quot;Time&quot;, for months afterward.

In addition, according to various press reports, after the Jonestown suicides, surviving Temple members in the U.S. announced their fears of being targeted by a &quot;hit squad&quot; which would be composed of Jonestown survivors. Similarly, in 1979, the Associated Press reported a U.S. Congressional aide&#x27;s claim that there were &quot;120 white, brainwashed assassins out from Jonestown awaiting the trigger word to pick up their hit.&quot;

Temple insider Michael Prokes, who had been ordered to deliver a suitcase which contained Temple funds which were supposed to be transferred to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, killed himself in March 1979, four months after the Jonestown incident. In the days leading up to his death, Prokes sent notes to several people, together with a thirty-page statement he had written about the Temple. Caen reprinted one copy in his &quot;Chronicle&quot; column. Prokes then arranged for a press conference in a Modesto, California motel room, during which he read a statement to the eight reporters who attended. He then excused himself, entered a restroom, and fatally shot himself in the head.

Before the tragedy, Temple member Paula Adams engaged in a romantic relationship with Guyana&#x27;s Ambassador to the United States, Laurence &quot;Bonny&quot; Mann. Adams later married Mann. On October 24, 1983, Mann fatally shot both Adams and the couple&#x27;s child, and then fatally shot himself. Defecting member Harold Cordell lost twenty family members on the evening of the poisonings. The Bogues family, which had also defected, lost their daughter Marilee (age 18), while defector Vernon Gosney lost his son Mark (age 5).

The mass suicide of the Peoples Temple has helped embed the idea that all new religious movements are destructive in the public&#x27;s mind. Bryan R. Wilson argues against that point of view by pointing out that only four other such events have occurred within similar religious groups: the Branch Davidians, the Solar Temple, Aum Shinrikyo and Heaven&#x27;s Gate.

===Bankruptcy and dissolution===
At the end of 1978, the Temple declared bankruptcy, and its assets went into receivership. In light of lawsuits, on December 4, 1978, Charles Garry, the corporation&#x27;s attorney, petitioned to dissolve the Temple. The petition was granted in San Francisco Superior Court in January 1979. A few Temple members remained in Guyana through May 1979 in order to wrap up the movement&#x27;s affairs, then they returned to the United States.

The Temple&#x27;s buildings in Los Angeles, Indianapolis, and Redwood Valley are all intact, as is the Temple&#x27;s former Georgetown headquarters. Some former Temple buildings, such as the Los Angeles facility, are presently used by church congregations. The Temple&#x27;s former San Francisco headquarters, located at 1859 Geary Boulevard, was destroyed in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake; the site is now occupied by a Post Office branch.

<text>The  () was an air raid shelter located near the Reich Chancellery in Berlin, Germany. It was part of a subterranean bunker complex constructed in two phases in 1936 and 1944. It was the last of the Führer Headquarters (&quot;Führerhauptquartiere&quot;) used by Adolf Hitler during World War II.

Hitler took up residence in the on 16 January 1945, and it became the centre of the Nazi regime until the last week of World War II in Europe. Hitler married Eva Braun there on 29 April 1945, less than 40 hours before they committed suicide.

After the war, both the old and new Chancellery buildings were levelled by the Soviet Red Army. The underground complex remained largely undisturbed until 1988–89, despite some attempts at demolition. The excavated sections of the old bunker complex were mostly destroyed during reconstruction of that area of Berlin. The site remained unmarked until 2006, when a small plaque was installed with a schematic diagram. Some corridors of the bunker still exist but are sealed off from the public.

== Construction ==
The Reich Chancellery bunker was initially constructed as a temporary air-raid shelter for Hitler, who actually spent very little time in the capital during most of the war. Increased bombing of Berlin led to expansion of the complex as an improvised permanent shelter. The elaborate complex consisted of two separate shelters, the &quot;Vorbunker&quot; (&quot;forward bunker&quot;; the upper bunker), completed in 1936, and the , located lower than the &quot;Vorbunker&quot; and to the west-southwest, completed in 1944. They were connected by a stairway set at right angles and could be closed off from each other by a bulkhead and steel door. The &quot;Vorbunker&quot; was located beneath the cellar of a large reception hall behind the old Reich Chancellery at Wilhelmstrasse 77. The was located about beneath the garden of the old Reich Chancellery, north of the new Reich Chancellery building at Voßstraße 6. Besides being deeper under ground, the had significantly more reinforcement. Its roof was made of concrete almost thick. About 30 small rooms were protected by approximately of concrete; exits led into the main buildings, as well as an emergency exit up to the garden. The development was built by the Hochtief company as part of an extensive programme of subterranean construction in Berlin begun in 1940. The construction cost for the totaled 1,349,899.29 Reichsmarks.

Hitler&#x27;s accommodations were in this newer, lower section, and by February 1945 it had been decorated with high-quality furniture taken from the Chancellery, along with several framed oil paintings. After descending the stairs into the lower section and passing through the steel door, there was a long corridor with a series of rooms on each side. On the right side were a series of rooms which included generator/ventilation rooms and the telephone switchboard. On the left side was Eva Braun&#x27;s bedroom/sitting room (also known as Hitler&#x27;s private guest room), an antechamber (also known as Hitler&#x27;s sitting room), which led into Hitler&#x27;s study/office. On the wall hung a large portrait of Frederick the Great, one of Hitler&#x27;s heroes. A door led into Hitler&#x27;s modestly furnished bedroom. Next to it was the conference/map room (also known as the briefing/situation room) which had a door that led out into the waiting room/anteroom.

The bunker complex was self-contained. However, as the was below the water table, conditions were unpleasantly damp, with pumps running continuously to remove groundwater. A diesel generator provided electricity, and well water was pumped in as the water supply. Communications systems included a telex, a telephone switchboard, and an army radio set with an outdoor antenna. As conditions deteriorated at the end of the war, Hitler received much of his war news from BBC radio broadcasts and via courier.

== End of World War II ==


Hitler moved into the on 16 January 1945, joined by his senior staff, including Martin Bormann. Eva Braun and Joseph Goebbels joined them in April, while Magda Goebbels and their six children took residence in the upper &quot;Vorbunker&quot;. Two or three dozen support, medical, and administrative staff were also sheltered there. These included Hitler&#x27;s secretaries (including Traudl Junge), a nurse named Erna Flegel, and Sergeant Rochus Misch, who was both bodyguard and telephone switchboard operator. Initially, Hitler continued to use the undamaged wing of the Reich Chancellery, where he held afternoon military conferences in his large study. Afterwards, he would have tea with his secretaries before returning to the bunker complex for the night. After several weeks of this routine, Hitler seldom left the bunker except for short strolls in the chancellery garden with his dog Blondi. The bunker was crowded, the atmosphere was oppressive, and air raids occurred daily. Hitler mostly stayed on the lower level, where it was quieter and he could sleep. Conferences took place for much of the night, often until 05:00.

On 16 April, the Red Army started the Battle of Berlin, and they started to encircle the city by 19 April. Hitler made his last trip to the surface on 20 April, his 56th birthday, going to the ruined garden of the Reich Chancellery where he awarded the Iron Cross to boy soldiers of the Hitler Youth. That afternoon, Berlin was bombarded by Soviet artillery for the first time.

Hitler was in denial about the dire situation and placed his hopes on the units commanded by Waffen-SS General Felix Steiner, the &quot;Armeeabteilung Steiner&quot; (&quot;Army Detachment Steiner&quot;). On 21 April, Hitler ordered Steiner to attack the northern flank of the encircling Soviet salient and ordered the German Ninth Army, south-east of Berlin, to attack northward in a pincer attack. That evening, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of Berlin. Hitler was told at his afternoon situation conference on 22 April that Steiner&#x27;s forces had not moved, and he fell into a tearful rage when he realised that the attack was not going to be carried out. He openly declared for the first time the war was lost—and he blamed his generals. Hitler announced that he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself.

On 23 April, Hitler appointed General of the Artillery Helmuth Weidling, commander of the LVI Panzer Corps, as the commander of the Berlin Defense Area, replacing Lieutenant Colonel () Ernst Kaether. The Red Army had consolidated their investment of Berlin by 25 April, despite the commands being issued from the . There was no prospect that the German defence could do anything but delay the city&#x27;s capture. Hitler summoned Field Marshal Robert Ritter von Greim from Munich to Berlin to take over command of the Luftwaffe from Hermann Göring, and he arrived on 26 April along with his mistress, the test pilot Hanna Reitsch.

On 28 April, Hitler learned that Heinrich Himmler was trying to discuss surrender terms with the Western Allies through Count Folke Bernadotte, and Hitler considered this treason. Himmler&#x27;s SS representative in Berlin, Hermann Fegelein, was shot after being court-martialed for desertion, and Hitler ordered Himmler&#x27;s arrest. On the same day, General Hans Krebs made his last telephone call from the to Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, Chief of German Armed Forces High Command (OKW) in Fürstenberg. Krebs told him that all would be lost if relief did not arrive within 48 hours. Keitel promised to exert the utmost pressure on Generals Walther Wenck, commander of the Twelfth Army, and Theodor Busse, commander of the Ninth Army. Meanwhile, Bormann wired to German Admiral Karl Dönitz: &quot;Reich Chancellery a heap of rubble.&quot; He said that the foreign press was reporting fresh acts of treason and &quot;that without exception Schörner, Wenck and the others must give evidence of their loyalty by the quickest relief of the Führer&quot;.

That evening, von Greim and Reitsch flew out from Berlin in an Arado Ar 96 trainer. Field Marshal von Greim was ordered to get the Luftwaffe to attack the Soviet forces that had just reached Potsdamer Platz, only a city block from the . During the night of 28 April, General Wenck reported to Keitel that his Twelfth Army had been forced back along the entire front and it was no longer possible for his army to relieve Berlin. Keitel gave Wenck permission to break off the attempt.

Hitler married Eva Braun after midnight on 28–29 April in a small civil ceremony within the . He then took secretary Traudl Junge to another room and dictated his last will and testament. Hans Krebs, Wilhelm Burgdorf, Goebbels, and Bormann witnessed and signed the documents at approximately 04:00. Hitler then retired to bed.

Late in the evening of 29 April, Krebs contacted Jodl by radio: &quot;Request immediate report. Firstly of the whereabouts of Wenck&#x27;s spearheads. Secondly of time intended to attack. Thirdly of the location of the Ninth Army. Fourthly of the precise place in which the Ninth Army will break through. Fifthly of the whereabouts of General Rudolf Holste&#x27;s spearhead.&quot; In the early morning of 30 April, Jodl replied to Krebs: &quot;Firstly, Wenck&#x27;s spearhead bogged down south of Schwielow Lake. Secondly, Twelfth Army therefore unable to continue attack on Berlin. Thirdly, bulk of Ninth Army surrounded. Fourthly, Holste&#x27;s Corps on the defensive.&quot;

SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; Wilhelm Mohnke, commander of the centre government district of Berlin, informed Hitler during the morning of 30 April that he would be able to hold for less than two days. Later that morning, Weidling informed Hitler that the defenders would probably exhaust their ammunition that night and again asked him for permission to break out. Weidling finally received permission at about 13:00. Hitler shot himself later that afternoon, at around 15:30, while Eva took cyanide. In accordance with Hitler&#x27;s instructions, his and Eva&#x27;s bodies were burned in the garden behind the Reich Chancellery. Goebbels became the new Head of Government and Chancellor of Germany (&quot;Reichskanzler&quot;) in accordance with Hitler&#x27;s last will and testament. &quot;Reichskanzler&quot; Goebbels and Bormann sent a radio message to Dönitz at 03:15, informing him of Hitler&#x27;s death, and that he was the new Head of State and President of Germany (&quot;Reichspräsident&quot;), in accordance with Hitler&#x27;s last will and testament.

Krebs talked to General Vasily Chuikov, commander of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, at about 04:00 on 1 May, and Chuikov demanded unconditional surrender of the remaining German forces. Krebs did not have the authority to surrender, so he returned to the bunker. In the late afternoon, Goebbels had his children poisoned, and he and his wife left the bunker at around 20:30. There are several different accounts on what followed. According to one account, Goebbels shot his wife and then himself. Another account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule and were given a &quot;coup de grâce&quot; immediately afterwards. Goebbels&#x27; SS adjutant Günther Schwägermann testified in 1948 that the couple walked ahead of him up the stairs and out to the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots, then walked up the remaining stairs and saw the lifeless bodies of the couple outside. He then followed Joseph Goebbels&#x27; order and had an SS soldier fire several shots into Goebbels&#x27; body, which did not move. The bodies were then doused with petrol and set alight, but the remains were only partially burned and not buried.

Weidling had given the order for the survivors to break out to the northwest, and the plan got underway at around 23:00. The first group from the Reich Chancellery was led by Mohnke; they tried unsuccessfully to break through the Soviet rings and were captured the next day. Mohnke was interrogated by SMERSH, like others who were captured from the . The third breakout attempt from the Reich Chancellery was made around 01:00 on 2 May, and Bormann managed to cross the Spree. Artur Axmann followed the same route and reported seeing Bormann&#x27;s body a short distance from the Weidendammer bridge.

At 01:00, the Soviet forces picked up a radio message from the LVI Panzer Corps requesting a cease-fire. Down in the , General Krebs and General Burgdorf committed suicide by gunshot to the head. The last defenders in the area of the bunker complex were mainly made up of Frenchmen of the 33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne, others being Waffen-SS from the remnants of the 11th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Nordland, Latvian SS and Spanish SS units. A group of French SS remained in the area of the bunker until the early morning of 2 May. The Soviet forces then captured the Reich Chancellery. General Weidling surrendered with his staff at 6:00, and his meeting with Chuikov ended at 8:23. Johannes Hentschel, the master electro-mechanic for the bunker complex, stayed after everyone else had either left or committed suicide, as the field hospital in the Reich Chancellery above needed power and water. He surrendered to the Red Army as they entered the bunker complex at 09:00 on 2 May. The bodies of Goebbels&#x27; six children were discovered on 3 May. They were found in their beds in the &quot;Vorbunker&quot; with the clear mark of cyanide shown on their faces.

== Post-war events ==
The first post-war photos of the interior of the were taken in July 1945. On 4 July, American writer James P. O&#x27;Donnell toured the bunker after giving the Soviet guard a pack of cigarettes. Many soldiers, politicians, and diplomats visited the bunker complex in the following days and months. Winston Churchill visited the Reich Chancellery and bunker on 14 July 1945. On 11 December 1945, the Soviets allowed a limited investigation of the bunker grounds by the other Allied powers. Two representatives from each nation watched several Germans dig up soil; this included the site where Hitler&#x27;s remains had been exhumed that May. Found during the dig were two hats identified as Hitler&#x27;s, an undergarment with Braun&#x27;s initials, and some reports to Hitler from Goebbels. The representatives planned to continue the work, but when they arrived the next morning, an NKVD armed guard met them and accused them of removing documents from the Chancellery. This was denied, but no further outside investigation was allowed until years later.

The outer ruins of both Chancellery buildings were levelled by the Soviets between 1945 and 1949 as part of an effort to destroy the landmarks of Nazi Germany. A detailed interior site investigation by the Soviets, including measurements, took place on 16 May 1946. Thereafter, the bunker largely survived, although some areas were partially flooded. In December 1947, the Soviets tried to blow up the bunker, but only the separation walls were damaged. In 1959, the East German government began a series of demolitions of the Chancellery, including the bunker. Because it was near the Berlin Wall, the site was undeveloped and neglected until 1988–89. During extensive construction of residential housing and other buildings on the site, work crews uncovered several underground sections of the old bunker complex; for the most part these were destroyed. Other parts of the Chancellery underground complex were uncovered, but these were ignored, filled in, or resealed.

Government authorities wanted to destroy the last vestiges of these Nazi landmarks. The construction of the buildings in the area around the was a strategy for ensuring the surroundings remained anonymous and unremarkable. The emergency exit point for the (which had been in the Chancellery gardens) was occupied by a car park.

On 8 June 2006, during the lead-up to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, an information board was installed to mark the location of the . The board, including a schematic diagram of the bunker, can be found at the corner of In den Ministergärten and Gertrud-Kolmar-Straße, two small streets about three minutes&#x27; walk from Potsdamer Platz. Rochus Misch, one of the last people living who was in the bunker at the time of Hitler&#x27;s suicide, attended the ceremony.

<text>The former subfamily Planigalinae contained the planigales and the ningauis: very small marsupial carnivores native to Australia which are, like the quolls, antechinuses, dibblers, Tasmanian devil, and many others, part of the biological order Dasyuromorphia: the carnivorous marsupials. The subfamily is now contained in the Sminthopsinae subfamily, and the two genera are split between two different tribes; the planigales are by themselves in their own tribe, while the ningaui are lumped with the dunnarts and the Kultarr.

There are 8 species in 2 genera. All members of the subfamily are very small, ranging from the paucident planigale at just over 10 grams to the smallest marsupial of all, the 4.3 gram long-tailed planigale. Most are about 8 grams, or about half the size of an average mouse.

Of the 8 species, two are from the tropical northern part of the continent, the other five from the arid or semi-arid centre. Four of the five planigales have been known for many years—John Gould described the common planigale in 1851—but the paucident planigale and all three ningauis were unknown to science until the 1970s and 1980s.

All 8 species are nocturnal carnivores which hunt a range of small creatures, typically insects, larvae, insect eggs, small lizards and the young of small mammals. Although tiny, they are very bold, at least some of the species regularly take prey larger than themselves. Even the widespread common planigale, which can be found in the outer suburbs of Brisbane is poorly known. Until the improvements in biochemical analysis methods towards the end of the 20th century, very little was known about the relationships between the smaller carnivorous marsupials: it is only in recent years that it has been possible to discover that the Planigalinae are a distinct group within the Dasyuromorphia.

Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao (28 May 1923 – 18 January 1996), often referred to by his initials NTR, was an Indian actor, film director, film producer, screenwriter, film editor, philanthropist, and politician who served as the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh for seven years over three terms. He is regarded as one of the most influential actors of Indian cinema. He starred in over 300 films, predominantly in Telugu cinema, and was referred to as &quot;&quot;Viswa Vikhyatha Nata Sarvabhouma&quot;&quot; (). he was also one of the earliest method actors of Indian cinema. Rao received three National Film Awards for co-producing &quot;Thodu Dongalu&quot; (1954) and &quot;Seetharama Kalyanam&quot; (1960) under National Art Theater, Madras, and for directing &quot;Varakatnam&quot; (1970). In 1968, The Government of India honoured him with Padma Shri, the fourth-highest civilian award, for his contributions to Indian cinema. In 2013, Rao was voted as &quot;Greatest Indian Actor of All Time&quot; in a CNN-IBN national poll conducted on the occasion of the Centenary of Indian Cinema. 

Known for his breakthrough performances in &quot;Raju Peda&quot; (1954) and &quot;Lava Kusa&quot; (1963), Rao garnered the Nandi Award for Best Actor for &quot;Kodalu Diddina Kapuram&quot; in 1970, and the Inaugural Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu in 1972 for &quot;Badi Panthulu&quot;.

Rama Rao made his debut as an actor in a Telugu social film &quot;Mana Desam&quot;, directed by L. V. Prasad in 1949. He gained popularity in the 1960s when he became well known for his portrayals of Hindu deities, especially Krishna, Shiva and Rama, roles which have made him a &quot;messiah of the masses&quot; and a prominent figure in the history of cinema. He later became known for portraying antagonistic characters and Robin Hood-esque hero characters in films. He starred in such films as &quot;Pathala Bhairavi&quot; (1951), the only south Indian film screened at the first International Film Festival of India, &quot;Malliswari&quot; (1951), featured at Peking Film Festival, Beijing, China, the enduring classics &quot;Mayabazar&quot; (1957) and &quot;Nartanasala&quot; (1963), featured at the Afro-Asian Film Festival that was held in Jakarta, Indonesia. All the four films were included in CNN-IBN&#x27;s list of &quot;100 greatest Indian films of all time&quot;. He co-produced &quot;Ummadi Kutumbam&quot;, nominated by Film Federation of India as one of its entries to the 1968 Moscow Film Festival. Besides Telugu, he has also acted in a few Tamil films. 

He founded the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in 1982 and served three tumultuous terms as Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh between 1983 and 1995. He was known as an advocate of Andhra Pradesh&#x27;s distinct cultural identity, distinguishing it from the erstwhile Madras State with which it was often associated. At the national level, he was instrumental in the formation of the National Front, a coalition of non-Congress parties which governed India in 1989 and 1990.

==Early life==
Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao was born on 28 May 1923 in a Telugu Hindu agrarian family to Nandamuri Lakshmaih and Nandamuri Venkata Ramamma, in Nimmakuru, a small village in Gudivada taluk of Krishna district, which was a part of the erstwhile Madras Presidency of British India. He was given in adoption to his paternal uncle because his uncle and aunt were childless. He was first educated by a teacher who came from a nearby village, whom he would attribute his command of Telugu to, as well as his father, an aspiring thespian and patron of the arts. Although children were normally pulled out of school after completing their primary education, on account of being the first male child in the family, his father sent him to Vijayawada, where he continued his education, matriculating in 1940 before studying at SRR &amp; CVR College and completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Andhra Christian College in Guntur. 

After qualifying for the civil service in what was then the Madras Presidency under British India, he took a job as a sub-registrar in Madras Service Commission at Mangalagiri, northeast of Guntur, a much-coveted job that he nevertheless quit within three weeks to pursue a career in acting. He developed a baritone singing voice as a young man.

==Personal life==
In May 1943, at the age of 20, while still pursuing his Intermediate, Rao married Basava Rama Tarakam, the daughter of his maternal uncle. The marriage resulted in twelve children; including eight sons and four daughters, namely: Ramakrishna Sr., Jayakrishna, Saikrishna, Nandamuri Harikrishna, Nandamuri Mohana Krishna, Balakrishna, Ramakrishna Jr., Jayashankarakrishna, Garapati Lokeswari (daughter), Daggubati Purandeswari (daughter), Nara Bhuvaneswari (daughter), and Kantamaneni Umamaheswari (daughter).

Tarakam died of cancer in 1985. In her memory, Rao established the Basavatarakam Indo-American Cancer Hospital in Hyderabad, in 1986. In 1993, NTR married Lakshmi Parvathi, a Telugu writer. The marriage was childless and lasted until NTR&#x27;s death less than three years later. Parvati was the author of NTR&#x27;s two-volume biography published in 2004. The first volume, &quot;Eduruleni Manishi&quot; (), covers his childhood and his entry into films. The second volume, &quot;Telugu Tejam&quot; (), deals with his political career.

NTR&#x27;s eldest son, Nandamuri Ramakrishna Sr., died in 1962, soon after Rao completed shooting of the film &quot;Irugu Porugu&quot;. Rao founded the film studios &quot;Ramakrishna Studios&quot; in Nacharam in his memory. NTR&#x27;s second son, Nandamuri Jayakrishna is a film exhibitor and producer, his son Nandamuri Chaitanya Krishna is also a film producer. NTR&#x27;s third son, Nandamuri Saikrishna, who was a theatre owner, died in 2004 following diabetic complications. His fourth son, Nandamuri Harikrishna, who died in a car accident on 29 August 2018, was a child actor-turned-politician elected to the Rajya Sabha, representing the TDP. Harikrishna&#x27;s sons Nandamuri Kalyan Ram and N. T. Rama Rao Jr. are also actors in the Telugu cinema, with the latter being one of the leading actors in Tollywood since the early-2000s. NTR&#x27;s fifth son Nandamuri Mohana Krishna is a cinematographer, and his son Taraka Ratna was also an actor who died in 2023. NTR&#x27;s sixth son, Nandamuri Balakrishna, has been one of the leading actors in Tollywood since the mid-1980s. He also started his career as a child artist. Balakrishna contested 2014 assembly elections as a TDP candidate. He won the Hindupur Assembly Constituency. His seventh son, Nandamuri Ramakrishna Jr. is a film producer.

NTR&#x27;s third daughter, Bhuvaneswari, is married to chief minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu. NTR&#x27;s second daughter, Daggubati Purandeswari, is a politician, who has represented the Indian National Congress in the Lok Sabha and served as a Union Minister. She later shifted her allegiance to the Bharatiya Janata Party. NTR&#x27;s fourth and youngest daughter, Uma Maheswari, was found dead at her home in Hyderabad&#x27;s Jubilee Hills on 1 August 2022. According to Police, her death appears to be an instance of suicide, but no suicide note was found.

==Film career==

Rama Rao started his film career with a walk-on role as a policeman in &quot;Mana Desam&quot; (1949). Following this, he appeared in &quot;Palletoori Pilla&quot; (1950), directed by B. A. Subba Rao. His first religious film was in 1957, where he portrayed the Hindu god Krishna in the blockbuster film &quot;Maya Bazaar&quot;. He played Krishna in 17 films, including some landmark films such as &quot;Sri Krishnarjuna Yudham&quot; (1962), the Tamil film &quot;Karnan&quot; (1964) and &quot;Daana Veera Soora Karna&quot; (1977). He was also known for his portrayal of the god Rama, essaying that role in films such as &quot;Lava Kusa&quot; (1963) and &quot;Sri Ramanjaneya Yuddham&quot; (1974) to name a few. He has also portrayed other characters from the Ramayana, such as Ravana in &quot;Bhookailas&quot; (1958) and &quot;Seetharama Kalyanam&quot; (1961) among others. He portrayed the god Vishnu in films such as &quot;Sri Venkateswara Mahatyam&quot; (1960) among others and the god Shiva in &quot;Dakshayagnam&quot; (1962). He has also enacted the roles of Mahabharata characters, such as Bheeshma, Arjuna, Bhima, Karna and Duryodhana. 
Later in his career, he stopped playing a prince in his commercial films and began to play roles of a poor yet heroic young man fighting against the existing system. These films appealed to the sentiments of the common man. Some of these films are &quot;Devudu Chesina Manushulu&quot; (1973), &quot;Adavi Ramudu&quot; (1977), &quot;Driver Ramudu&quot; (1979), &quot;Vetagadu&quot; (1979), &quot;Sardar Papa Rayudu&quot; (1980), &quot;Kondaveeti Simham&quot; (1981), &quot;Justice Chowdary&quot; (1982) and &quot;Bobbili Puli&quot; (1982). His film &quot;Lava Kusa&quot;, in which he starred as Rama, collected 10 million in 1963. He directed and acted in the hagiographical film &quot;Srimadvirat Veerabrahmendra Swami Charitra&quot; (1984). He also acted in films such as &quot;Brahmashi Viswamitra&quot; (1991) and &quot;Major Chandrakanth&quot; (1993). His last film was &quot;Srinatha Kavi Sarvabhowmudu&quot;, a biographical film on the Telugu poet Srinatha, which released in 1993.

In the later half of his career, Rao became a screenwriter. Despite having no formal training in scriptwriting, he authored several screenplays for his own movies as well as for other producers. He also produced many of his films as well as other actor&#x27;s films through his film production house National Art Theater Private Limited, Madras and later Ramakrishna Studios, Hyderabad. He actively campaigned for the construction of a large number of cinemas through this production house. He was influential in designing and implementing a financial system that funded the production and distribution of movies. He was so dedicated to his profession that he would often learn new things to portray a particular character on-screen perfectly and realistically. At the age of 40, he learnt dance from the Kuchipudi dancer Vempati Chinna Satyam for his role in the film &quot;Nartanasala&quot; (1963).

==Political career==
Nadendla Bhaskara Rao, a veteran politician joined Telugu Desam Party (TDP) founded by Rama Rao, on 29 March 1982 in Hyderabad. He said that this decision was based on a historic need to rid Andhra Pradesh of the corrupt and inept rule of the Indian National Congress, which had governed the state since its formation in 1956.

===First term as Chief Minister, 1983===

In the elections, the TDP allied with the Sanjaya Vichara Manch party and decided to field educated candidates who had a good name in the society and were not indulging in corruption, which was an innovative political concept at the time. Rao himself decided to contest from two assembly constituencies, Gudivada and Tirupati. He used many innovative ways of campaigning, such as being the first politician in India to use rath yatras for campaigning. For this, he used a modified Chevrolet van which was given the name of &quot;Chaitanya Ratham&quot;. In this, Rao travelled across the state of Andhra Pradesh, crisscrossing all the districts. With his son Nandamuri Harikrishna, also a film actor, driving the van, Rao notched up over 75,000 kilometers during his campaign, a distinctive sight with the van&#x27;s yellow party flags and banners and Rao sitting on top of the vehicle hailing the crowds. He campaigned for restoring the dignity of the Telugu people and advocated forming a closer bond between the government and the common people, going into the elections with the slogan, &quot;Telugu Vari Atma Gauravam&quot; (lit. &quot;Telugu people&#x27;s self-respect&quot;).

In the 1983 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, TDP won by an absolute majority winning 202 out of the 294 seats in the state assembly, with Rao himself winning both the seats he contested. Their alliance with the Sanjaya Vichara Manch fetched 202 seats. Rao was sworn in as the 10th and the first non-Congress Chief Minister of the state on 9 January 1983 with ten cabinet ministers and five ministers of State.

===Loss of power, 1984===
On 15 August 1984, Rao was removed from office by the then Governor of Andhra Pradesh Thakur Ram Lal, while Rao was in the US to undergo open heart surgery. His finance minister, Nadendla Bhaskara Rao, a former Congressman, was made the Chief Minister by the Governor Thakur Ram Lal. Bhaskar Rao purportedly had the support of majority of the TDP MLAs.

===Return to power, 1984===
Rama Rao returned to India immediately after his surgery, disputed the claims by Bhaskara Rao and demonstrated his strength by bringing all the MLAs supporting him, which was a majority in the 294-member assembly, to the Raj Bhavan (Governor&#x27;s Office). Ramlal did not relent, as a result of which Rama Rao relaunched his &quot;Chaitanya Ratham&quot; campaign, this time campaigning for the restoration of democracy by mobilizing the support of people and various anti-Congress political parties in the country including the Janata Party (JP), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and the National Conference (NC). During the one-month crisis, the MLAs supporting Rama Rao were secured in a secret place to avoid horse-trading. This was achieved with the support of Ramakrishna Hegde, Chief Minister of Karnataka. Ramakrishna Hegde moved all the TDP MLAs to a Budget Hotel, Das Prakash, in Mysuru (Mysore), as Congress was known for poaching MLAs regularly and was felt necessitated. This was the first time in Indian Politics that MLAs were secured at a safe place from poaching. Also, due to mobilization of several political parties and the people and due to press, the Prime Minister Indira Gandhi unwillingly removed Governor Ramlal and appointed a Congress veteran, Shankar Dayal Sharma, as the governor of Andhra Pradesh to pave the way for restoring Rao.

===Campaigning in Tamil Nadu, 1984===
In 1984, when the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu and fellow senior actor M. G. Ramachandran (M.G.R.) was unable to campaign in the state assembly election due to him being hospitalized in the US, N.T.R., who was a close friend of M.G.R., and R. M. Veerappan who was handling the party affairs, campaigned for the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). As leader of the National Front, he campaigned extensively for the constituent parties when they faced elections, again using his &quot;Chaitanya Ratham&quot; campaigning concept.

===General elections, 1984===

A month later, Indira Gandhi was assassinated and was succeeded as prime minister by her son, Rajiv Gandhi. In the ensuing national elections to the Lok Sabha, the Congress, riding on the sympathy wave caused by Gandhi&#x27;s assassination, won convincingly all over the country except in Andhra Pradesh where the TDP secured a landslide victory. TDP became the first regional party to serve as the main opposition party in the Lok Sabha.

===Second term as Chief Minister, 1985===

Meanwhile, in the state, Rao recommended dissolution of the Assembly and called for fresh elections the following year in the state to ensure that the people had a fresh choice to elect their representatives. The TDP again won with a massive majority in those elections, with Rao winning from 3 seats: Hindupur, Nalgonda and Gudivada, thus marking the beginning of his second term as Chief Minister. Senior Leaders of the Congress in the state including former Chief Ministers Kasu Brahmananda Reddy and Kotla Vijaya Bhaskara Reddy lost in their constituencies of Narasaraopet and Kurnool respectively to the TDP. Rao completed his five-year term as Chief Minister.

===Years as opposition, 1989===
In the December 1989 assembly elections however, he was voted out of power due to a wave of anti-incumbency sweeping the state as a result of which the Congress returned to power. During this time, he suffered a mild stroke, as a result of which he was unable to campaign, which, according to some political analysts and TDP supporters, was the reason for the TDP&#x27;s loss.

===National politics, 1989===

During 1989, he established himself in national politics, forming a coalition of non-Congress parties opposed to the Congress known as the National Front. It included parties, besides the TDP, such as the Janata Dal and the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP). This alliance governed India between 1989 and 1990 with support from the BJP. Meanwhile, Rao assumed the position as the Leader of Opposition in the state. His National Front government at the national level led by V. P. Singh was at the forefront of social justice by implementing the provisions in the &quot;Mandal Commission&quot; for providing 27% reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBC&#x27;s).

===Third term as Chief Minister, 1994===

Rao returned to power for a third and final time in the December 1994 state assembly elections with his party in alliance with the Left Front. This alliance won 269 seats in the 294 seat Assembly, with the TDP alone winning 226. The Congress, which once again had multiple Chief Ministers in the state during its five-year rule between 1989 and 1994, won only 26 seats. Rao contested again from Hindupur and won the seat for the third consecutive time, achieving a rare hat-trick of wins from the same assembly constituency. He also won from another assembly constituency, Tekkali. In 1995, TDP leaders unhappy with Lakshmi Parvati NTR wife interring in politics, led a revolt in the party against Rao, which led to N. Chandrababu Naidu becoming the CM on 1 September 1995 replacing Rao. The internal rebellion was triggered by the controversial role of Lakshmi Parvathi, NTR&#x27;s second wife, in the party and the government. Naidu was able to secure the support of the majority of the legislators. Following this, NTR vowed to take revenge against Naidu in an interview with Reuters. However, NTR died in 1996. His second wife, Lakshmi Parvathi led NTR Telugu Desam Party which was eventually closed and joined INC, later YSRCP.

A Democrat, Doxey served as prosecuting attorney of Marshall County from 1915 to 1923. From 1923 to 1929, he was district attorney for Mississippi&#x27;s Third Judicial District.

In addition to membership in the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, Doxey was active in Freemasonry and the Shriners. He also belonged to the Elks, Rotary Club, Phi Delta Phi legal fraternity and Omicron Delta Kappa college fraternity.

== Congress ==
===U.S. House===
In 1928, Doxey was elected to represent Mississippi&#x27;s 2nd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. He was reelected six times, and served from 1929 to 1941. Doxey was a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions of 1932, 1936, and 1940.

Throughout his political career, Doxey represented a district with a black-majority population. Black voters were largely affiliated with the Republican Party in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but they were effectively excluded from Mississippi&#x27;s political system by the state constitution and legal restrictions that prevented them from registering to vote.

=== U.S. Senate ===
After the death of U.S. Senator Pat Harrison, Doxey won a special election to fill the seat, and served in the United States Senate from 1941 until 1943. He was defeated in the 1942 Democratic primary by James Eastland.

==Later career==
Doxey served as United States Senate Sergeant at Arms from February 1, 1943, to January 3, 1947. He is the only former senator to have served in this post. He served for the rest of 1947 as a hearing examiner for the United States Department of Agriculture. Doxey then returned to Holly Springs, where he practiced law until his retirement.

Doxey died in Memphis, Tennessee on March 2, 1962. He was buried at Hillcrest Cemetery in Holly Springs.

== Legacy ==
Mississippi&#x27;s Wall Doxey State Park is named for Doxey. Construction of the park took place from 1935 to 1938, and it was the eighth of ten Mississippi parks built by the Civilian Conservation Corps. Originally named Spring Lake State Park, the site was renamed in 1956. In 1997, the older part of the site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Wall Doxey State Park Historic District.

<text>Byron Patton &quot;Pat&quot; Harrison (August 29, 1881June 22, 1941) was a Mississippi politician who served as a Democrat in the United States House of Representatives from 1911 to 1919 and in the United States Senate from 1919 until his death.

==Early life and education==
Pat Harrison was born at Crystal Springs, Mississippi. His father was a Confederate veteran of the Civil War and died in 1885. As a child, Harrison sold newspapers to supplement his family&#x27;s income. After graduating as class valedictorian from Crystal Springs High School in 1899, he attended a summer term at the University of Mississippi before transferring to Louisiana State University at Baton Rouge on a baseball scholarship.

He dropped out after two years due to a lack of funds but was brought on to pitch for the Pickens, Mississippi, semi-professional baseball team in the &#x27;Old Tomato League&#x27; summer circuit. After his stint in semi-professional baseball, Harrison moved to Leakesville, Mississippi. He taught and later became principal of the local high school. While supporting himself as an educator, Harrison studied law. He passed the Mississippi State Bar and opened a law practice in 1902.

==Legal and political career==
In 1906, Harrison was elected district attorney to the Second Judicial District, and in 1908, moved to Gulfport, Mississippi. He served as district attorney until being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1910. The 1910 election introduced Harrison as a skilled orator and witty debater, a reputation he maintained throughout his political career. Newspaper editor Clayton Rand described his longtime friend&#x27;s oratory style as &quot;an eloquence that flowed like a babbling brook through a field of flowers.&quot;

===Political career===
After four years as district attorney on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Harrison won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1911 and was re-elected three times. One of the youngest members of the House, Harrison made his mark as an effective debater against Republican tariff and tax policies and soon became a favored aide to Democratic President Woodrow Wilson. In particular, Harrison supported Wilson&#x27;s New Freedom policies and those concerning Mexico and Germany at the onset of America&#x27;s involvement in World War I. In 1918, he ran against incumbent U.S. Senator James K. Vardaman, an enemy of President Wilson. In return for Harrison&#x27;s past support, President Wilson personally endorsed him for Senator. Already popular among his constituents, Harrison emphasized his differences with Vardaman and won over a majority of Mississippi voters, who were effectively limited to white Democrats, following the state legislature&#x27;s disenfranchisement of most black voters by a new constitution and discriminatory practices dating from 1890. After winning Vardaman&#x27;s Senate seat in 1918, Harrison was re-elected for another three terms, as Mississippi was a one-party state dominated by Democrats. He ran unopposed in 1930 for his third term in the U.S. Senate.

A supporter and former law partner of Theodore G. Bilbo, Stewart C. &quot;Sweep Clean&quot; Broom surprisingly aided Harrison&#x27;s 1936 reelection campaign by giving a well-received speech encouraging &quot;Bilbo folks&quot; to save Bilbo &quot;from his own blunder.&quot; Despite having received past help from Harrison, Bilbo actively supported Martin Sennett Conner for Harrison&#x27;s Senate seat, presumably as a self-serving political maneuver.
As chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, Harrison was one of the three or four key people behind the creation of the Social Security system in 1935. He also promoted low tariffs and reciprocal trade agreements. When the Senate majority leader&#x27;s job opened up in 1937, Harrison was expected to win the position, but nose counts put him in a near tie with Kentucky&#x27;s Alben Barkley. Harrison&#x27;s campaign manager asked Bilbo, the junior member from Mississippi, to consider voting for his fellow Mississippian. Bilbo, a race-baiting Democratic demagogue whose base was among tenant farmers, hated the upper-class Harrison, who represented the rich planters. The rivalry between the two had deepened over years of disagreement over aspects of the New Deal and how federal money should be distributed throughout Mississippi. Bilbo said he would vote for Harrison only if he were personally asked. Harrison replied, &quot;Tell the son of a bitch I wouldn&#x27;t speak to him even if it meant the presidency of the United States.&quot; Despite Harrison&#x27;s support for Roosevelt and his policies, shortly before the vote, the president wrote a letter of support for Barkley. When the ballots were in, Harrison lost by one vote, 37–38.

Like other Southern Senators, he opposed federal action on civil rights, becoming the first senator to use the Senate Journal as a means to filibuster during the 1922 debate on the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill. The Senate rules state that &quot;the reading of the Journal shall not be suspended unless by unanimous consent&quot;, so Harrison&#x27;s discussion of the Senate Journal was unable to be clotured until the sponsors withdrew the Bill.

Harrison served on the Senate Finance Committee and was chairman of that body from 1933 to 1941 (Seventy-third through Seventy-seventh Congresses), and served as President pro tempore of the Senate during the Seventy-seventh Congress, in 1941 until his death that year. He was also a supporter of the Conservative coalition.

===Political reputation===
Harrison was a highly effective politician and a brilliant orator. He listened to his district and provided information, services, and patronage. Due to his ability to maneuver through the political landscape and because he was well-liked by many of his fellow politicians, Harrison became rather influential in both legislation and political endorsement. In 1928, he supported New York Governor Al Smith for President and campaigned for him across the South, where there was opposition and superstition among white Southerners because of Smith’s Catholicism.

Harrison became known as the &quot;Gadfly of the Senate&quot; due to his oratory rebuking Republican policies.

At the 1932 Democratic National Convention, he swung the Mississippi delegation to Franklin D. Roosevelt on the crucial third ballot and became welcome at the White House.

Senator Tom Connally, who supported Harrison&#x27;s unsuccessful bid to become Senate majority leader, described him in his autobiography as such:

==Death==
On 16 June 1941, Harrison underwent surgery for an intestinal obstruction. He died from post-operative complications six days later.

<text>The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game, released by Decipher, Inc. in 2002, is a tabletop role-playing game set in the fictional world of Middle-earth created by J. R. R. Tolkien. The game is set in the years between &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, but may be run at any time from the First to Fourth Age and contains many examples of how to do so. Sourcebooks cover the events of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and Peter Jackson&#x27;s film trilogy adaptation.

The system for &quot;LOTR&quot; is called &quot;CODA&quot;, and involves rolling two six-sided dice to resolve actions. The game is the second licensed role-playing game for the setting, the prior game being &quot;Middle-earth Role Playing&quot; from Iron Crown Enterprises. A third role-playing game set in Middle-earth was published (2011-2019) by Cubicle 7 under the title &quot;The One Ring Roleplaying Game&quot;, which has since been acquired, revised, and is now published by Free League Publishing, alongside a 5th Edition OGL game titled &quot;The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying&quot;.

==Races==

The character races available in the &quot;Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game&quot; are:
*Dwarves (Khazad): Short, stocky bearded folk, strong and hardy, able to endure pain, fatigue and suffering better than other races. Upon reaching maturity they appear old in a fashion that belies their hardiness. They often live in subterranean kingdoms, and have a great love of craftworks, especially things made of gold, silver, and &quot;mithril&quot;.
*Elves (Eldar): The oldest and wisest of races of Middle-earth, they are immortal, noble, and fair. Their kind have far clearer sight and perception than Men, and they&#x27;re nimble. They are naturally aware of many things that are hidden from the Younger Children. They are divided into a number of particular kinds, primarily based on their course through Elven history. The Noldor or High Elves are those that heeded the call of the Valar and traveled across the sea, most of them later rebelling and following Fëanor back to Middle-earth in pursuit of the Silmarils. They are wise in Lore and Smithcraft, and created many Rings of Power. The Sindar or Grey Elves are those that heard the call, but stopped and chose to stay in Beleriand. These are the more numerous kind of elf in the Third Age, and have great love of, and talent with, music and song. The Silvan Elves or Wood Elves are those that ceased their journey to the West before crossing the Misty Mountains. During the Third age, they live in woodland realms such as Lothlórien or caverns in the mountains of Mirkwood. They have facility with wilderness skills. 
*Hobbits: The signature race of Tolkien, these diminutive people are a distant relation to men. They are good-natured, hospitable and easy going folk, two to four feet in height with hair covered feet. There are three major strains of Hobbits: Fallohides, taller, slimmer, fairer, and more uncommon than their fellows, they often have more facility with language, song, and craft, and have an unusual adventurous streak. Harfoots are the most numerous kind, and tend to be shorter and browner than others. They are nimble with crafts, more friendly with Dwarves, and tend to stick to the custom of living in holes and tunnels. The Stoors are broader and sturdier and most numerous in Buckland. These are the only Hobbits who know anything about boating, swimming and fishing.
*Men: The most familiar character race, these still come in several varieties available for player characters. Dúnedain are descendants of the Númenóreans, themselves descendant of Elros Tar-Minyatur, twin brother of Elrond Halfelven. The Men of Twilight, including the Rohirrim, the Beornings, Dunlendings and the majority of Gondorians (due to centuries of interbreeding), are men who did not go to Númenor but remained in Middle-earth. These are typical Men. The Men of Darkness are the Easterlings, the Haradrim (Southrons), and Variags of Khand, most of whom have lived under the sway of Sauron. They are shorter, broader, darker of hair and eye, and duskier. Finally, there are Wild Men, who are short and squat and live rudely in the wild, though they carry their own nobility and powers. These include the Drúedain (Woses) who live in the forest of Anórien and the Lossoth (Snowmen of Forochel) who live in the Northern Waste.

==Classes==
The character classes available in the &quot;Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Adventure Game&quot; are:
* Barbarian: A warrior of the wilds who may lack some of the refined skills and weapons of other fighting men, but who make up for it with woodcraftiness and ferocity. Ghân-buri-Ghân and his people the Drúedain belong to this order, as well as many Dunlendings and easterlings
* Craftsman: A person skilled in the arts of making, able to craft items both useful and wondrous, or who serves others in some ordinary capacity. Sam Gamgee, Barliman Butterbur, many Dwarves, and the Noldorin jewelsmiths, such as Fëanor, are all craftsmen.
* Lore-master: One wise in the lore of Middle-earth and who, though not a true caster of spells, can use some minor or subtle magics. Denethor, Elrond, Celeborn, and many Elves are lore-masters.
* Magician: One who works magic and casts spells based on learned lore and wisdom but who is not nearly as powerful as a wizard. Galadriel is a good example of a magician, as is Melian the Maia, Queen of Doriath and the consort of the elven King Elu Thingol from The Silmarillion.
* Mariner: A sailor, one who knows how to work and helm ships great and small over the wide seas and on the Great River. Coastal Gondorians and the Corsairs of Umbar count many mariners among their number.
* Minstrel: A singer of songs, teller of tales, and a chronicler of brave and noble deeds. With his words and music, he can inspire others. An example is King Theoden&#x27;s minstrel, Gleowine who wrote the funeral song which the Riders of Rohan sang around Theoden&#x27;s mound. Tom Bombadil, a mysterious character not only known for his love of song and dance, could likely be considered a member of this order.
* Noble: A person who, due to birth, wealth, accomplishment, or the like, is regarded as of high rank in society, entitled to deference and respect from other folk. Characters such as Aragorn, Galadriel, Denethor and his sons, Elrond and his daughter Arwen, the Rohirrim Royal Family, and even Frodo belong, at least in part, to this order.
* Rogue: A person who lives and works with his wits and deft hands, often at questionable or outlawed pursuits. He may be a spy for the Enemy, a professional treasure seeker, or simply one who prefers subtlety and guile to warfare and bloodshed. Bilbo, during his brief adventure with Thorin and company, became a member of this order. Gríma Wormtongue is also a rogue, as are the thugs hired by Saruman who raided the Hobbit Shire.
* Warrior: People, such as guardsmen, soldiers, and archers, who are trained to fight with weapons. This is the most common order depicted in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and it may likely be so in most chronicles as well. It includes Aragorn, Boromir, Éomer, Éowyn, most Rohirrim, Beregond, Prince Imrahil, and eventually, Merry and Pippin.

<text>The First Indochina War (generally known as the Indochina War in France, and as the Anti-French Resistance War in Vietnam, and alternatively internationally as the French-Indochina War) was fought between France and Việt Minh (Democratic Republic of Vietnam), and their respective allies, from 19 December 1946 until 21 July 1954. Việt Minh was led by Võ Nguyên Giáp and Hồ Chí Minh. Most of the fighting took place in Tonkin in Northern Vietnam, although the conflict engulfed the entire country and also extended into the neighboring French Indochina protectorates of Laos and Cambodia.

At the Potsdam Conference in July 1945, the Allied Combined Chiefs of Staff decided that Indochina south of latitude 16° north was to be included in the Southeast Asia Command under British Admiral Mountbatten. On V-J Day, September 2, Hồ Chí Minh proclaimed in Hanoi (Tonkin&#x27;s capital) the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV). In late September 1945, Chinese forces entered Tonkin, and Japanese forces to the north of that line surrendered to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. At the same time, British forces landed in Saigon (Cochinchina&#x27;s capital), and Japanese forces in the south surrendered to the British. The Chinese acknowledged the DRV under Hồ Chí Minh, then in power in Hanoi. The British refused to do that in Saigon, and deferred to the French, despite the previous support of the Việt Minh by American OSS representatives. The DRV ruled as the only civil government in all of Vietnam for a period of about 20 days, after the abdication of Emperor Bảo Đại, who had governed under the Japanese rule.

On 23 September 1945, with the knowledge of the British commander in Saigon, French forces overthrew the local DRV government, and declared French authority restored in Cochinchina. Guerrilla warfare began around Saigon immediately, but the French gradually retook control of much of Indochina. Hồ Chí Minh agreed to talk with France but negotiations failed. After one year of low-level conflict, all-out war broke out in December 1946 between French and Việt Minh forces as Hồ Chí Minh and his government went underground. The French tried to stabilize Indochina by reorganizing it as a Federation of Associated States. In 1949, they put former Emperor Bảo Đại back in power, as the ruler of a newly established State of Vietnam.
The first few years of the war involved a low-level rural insurgency against the French.

During 1950 the conflict to a considerable extent turned into a conventional war between two armies equipped with modern weapons, with the French supplied by the United States, and the Việt Minh supplied by the Soviet Union and a newly communist China. Guerrilla warfare continued to occur in large areas. French Union forces included colonial troops from the empire – North Africans; Laotian, Cambodian and Vietnamese ethnic minorities; Sub-Saharan Africans – and professional French troops, European volunteers, and units of the Foreign Legion. The use of French metropolitan recruits was forbidden by the government to prevent the war from becoming more unpopular at home. It was called the &quot;dirty war&quot; () by French leftists.

The French strategy of inducing the Việt Minh to attack well-defended bases in remote areas at the end of their logistical trails succeeded at the Battle of Nà Sản. French efforts were hampered by the limited usefulness of tanks in forest terrain, the lack of a strong air force, and reliance on soldiers from French colonies. The Việt Minh used novel and efficient tactics, including direct artillery fire, convoy ambushes, and anti-aircraft weaponry to impede land and air resupplies, while recruiting a sizable regular army facilitated by large popular support. They used guerrilla warfare doctrine and instruction from Mao&#x27;s China, and used war materiel provided by the Soviet Union. This combination proved fatal for the French bases, culminating in a decisive French defeat at the Battle of Điện Biên Phủ.
An estimated 400,000 to 842,707 soldiers died during the war as well as between 125,000 and 400,000 civilians. Both sides committed war crimes including killings of civilians (such as the Mỹ Trạch massacre by French troops), rape and torture.

At the International Geneva Conference on 21 July 1954, the new socialist French government and the Việt Minh agreed to give the Việt Minh control of North Vietnam above the 17th parallel, but this was rejected by the State of Vietnam and the United States. A year later, Bảo Đại would be deposed by his prime minister, Ngô Đình Diệm, creating the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). Soon an insurgency, backed by the communist north, developed against Diệm&#x27;s anti-communist government. This conflict, known as the Vietnam War, included large U.S. military intervention in support of the South Vietnamese and ended in 1975 with the defeat of South Vietnam to the North Vietnamese and the reunification of Vietnam.

== Background ==

Vietnam was absorbed into French Indochina in stages between 1858 and 1887. Vietnamese nationalism grew until World War II, which provided a break in French control. Early Vietnamese resistance centered on the intellectual Phan Bội Châu. Châu looked to Japan, which had modernized and was one of the few Asian nations to successfully resist European colonization. With Prince Cường Để, Châu started the two organizations in Japan, the Duy Tân hội (Modernistic Association) and Vietnam Cong Hien Hoi.

Due to French pressure, Japan deported Phan Bội Châu to China. Witnessing Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Xinhai Revolution, Châu was inspired to commence the Viet Nam Quang Phục Hội movement in Guangzhou. From 1914 to 1917, he was imprisoned by Yuan Shikai&#x27;s counterrevolutionary government. In 1925, he was captured by French agents in Shanghai and spirited to Vietnam. Due to his popularity, Châu was spared from execution and placed under house arrest until his death in 1940.

In September 1940, the Empire of Japan launched its invasion of French Indochina, parallel with its ally Germany&#x27;s conquest of metropolitan France. Keeping the French colonial administration, the Japanese ruled from behind the scenes, as did the Germans in Vichy France. For Vietnamese nationalists, this was a double-puppet government, with the Axis powers behind the French behind the Vietnamese local officials. Emperor Bảo Đại collaborated with the Japanese, just as he had with the French, ensuring his continued safety and comfort.

From October 1940 to May 1941, during the Franco-Thai War, the Vichy French in Indochina defended their colony in a border conflict in which the forces of Thailand invaded while the Japanese sat on the sidelines. Thai military successes were limited to the Cambodian border area, and in January 1941 Vichy France&#x27;s modern naval forces soundly defeated the inferior Thai naval forces in the Battle of Ko Chang. The war ended in May, with the French agreeing to minor territorial revisions which restored formerly Thai areas to Thailand.
In 1940, Hồ Chí formed the Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi (Việt Minh, or League for the Independence of Vietnam). He founded the Việt Minh as an umbrella organization, seeking to appeal to a base beyond his own communist beliefs by emphasizing national liberation instead of class struggle. In 1941, Hồ and Indochina Communist Party founded a communist-led united front to oppose the Japanese.

In March 1945, with the World War all but lost, Japan launched the Second French Indochina Campaign to oust the Vichy French, and formally installed Emperor Bảo Đại as head of a nominally independent Vietnam. The Japanese arrested and imprisoned most of the French officials and military remaining in the country.

In Hanoi on 15–20 April 1945, the Tonkin Revolutionary Military Conference of the Việt Minh issued a resolution (reprinted 25 August 1970 in the &quot;Nhân Dân&quot; journal) calling for a general uprising, resistance and guerrilla warfare against the Japanese. It also called on the French in Vietnam to recognize Vietnamese independence and on the DeGaulle French government (Allied French) to recognize Vietnam&#x27;s independence and fight alongside them against Japan.

In an article from August 1945, (republished 17 August 1970), the North Vietnamese National Assembly Chairman Truong Chinh denounced the Japanese Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere as a regime to plunder Asia and to replace the United States and British colonial rule with Japanese colonial rule. Truong Chinh also denounced the retreating Japanese&#x27;s Three Alls policy: kill all, burn all, loot all. According to Truong the Japanese also tried to pit different ethnic and political groups within Indochina against each other and attempted to infiltrate the Viet Minh.
The Japanese forced Vietnamese women to join Burmese, Indonesian, Thai and Filipino comfort women as slaves to the Japanese army.

The Japanese inflicted two billion US dollars worth (1945 values) of damage, including destruction of industrial plants, 90% of heavy vehicles, motorcycles, and cars, and 16 tons of junks, railways, port installations, and one third of the bridges. In the Japanese-imposed Famine of 1945, one to two million Vietnamese starved to death in the Red river delta of northern Vietnam. The North Vietnamese government accused both France and Japan of the famine. By the time the Chinese came to disarm the Japanese, Vietnamese corpses littered the streets of Hanoi.

In the Declaration of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hồ Chí Minh blamed &quot;the double yoke of the French and the Japanese&quot; for the deaths of &quot;more than two million&quot; Vietnamese.

American President Franklin D. Roosevelt and General Joseph Stilwell privately opposed continued French rule in Indochina after the war. Roosevelt suggested that Chiang Kai-shek place Indochina under Chinese rule; Chiang Kai-shek supposedly replied: &quot;Under no circumstances!&quot; Following Roosevelt&#x27;s death in April 1945, U.S. resistance to French rule weakened.

===After the surrender of Japan===

Japanese forces in Vietnam surrendered on 15 August 1945, and an armistice was signed between Japan and the United States on 20 August. The Provisional Government of the French Republic wanted to restore its colonial rule in French Indochina as the final step of the Liberation of France.
On 22 August, OSS agents Archimedes Patti and Carleton B. Swift Jr. arrived in Hanoi on a mercy mission to liberate Allied POWs, accompanied by French official Jean Sainteny. As the only law enforcement, the Imperial Japanese Army remained in power, keeping French colonial troops and Sainteny detained, to the benefit of the developing Vietnamese nationalist forces.
The Viet Minh claimed that they, alongside Meo (Hmong) and Muong tribesmen, subdued the Japanese in a nationwide rebellion from 9 March to 19 August 1945, taking control of 6 provinces, although some of these claims are contested.
Beginning with the August Revolution, Japanese forces allowed the Việt Minh and other nationalist groups to take over public buildings and weapons. For the most part, the Japanese Army destroyed their equipment or surrendered it to Allied forces, but some of the weapons fell to the Việt Minh, including some French equipment. The Việt Minh also recruited more than 600 Japanese soldiers to train Vietnamese.

On 25 August, Hồ Chí Minh persuaded Emperor Bảo Đại to abdicate and become &quot;supreme advisor&quot; to the new Việt Minh-led government in Hanoi. On September 2, aboard in Tokyo Bay, CEFEO Expeditionary Corps leader General Leclerc signed the armistice with Japan on behalf of France. The same day, Hồ Chí Minh declared Vietnam&#x27;s independence from France. Deliberately echoing the American Declaration of Independence, he proclaimed:
We hold the truth that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, among them life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
Ho Chi Minh denounced the reimposition of French rule, accusing the French of selling out the Vietnamese to the Japanese twice in four years.
On 13 September 1945, a Franco-British task force landed in Java, main island of the Dutch East Indies (for which independence was being sought by Sukarno), and Saigon, capital of Cochinchina (southern part of French Indochina), both being occupied by the Japanese under Field Marshal Hisaichi Terauchi, Commander-in-Chief of Japan&#x27;s Southern Expeditionary Army Group based in Saigon. Allied troops in Saigon were an airborne detachment, two British companies of the Indian 20th Infantry Division and the French 5th Colonial Infantry Regiment, with British General Sir Douglas Gracey as supreme commander. The latter proclaimed martial law on September 21, and Franco-British troops took control of Saigon.
As agreed at the Potsdam Conference, 200,000 troops of the Chinese 1st Army occupied northern Indochina to the 16th parallel, while the British under the South-East Asia Command of Lord Mountbatten occupied the south. The Chinese troops had been sent by Chiang Kai-shek under General Lu Han to accept the surrender of Japanese forces occupying that area, then to supervise the disarming and repatriation of the Japanese Army. In the North, the Chinese permitted the DRV government to remain in charge of local administration and food supply. Initially, the Chinese kept the French Colonial soldiers interned, with the acquiescence of the Americans. The Chinese used the VNQDĐ, the Vietnamese branch of the Chinese Kuomintang, to increase their influence in Indochina and put pressure on their opponents.
Chiang Kai-shek deliberately withheld his best soldiers from Vietnam, holding them in reserve for the fight against the Communists inside China, and instead sent undisciplined warlord troops from Yunnan under Lu Han to occupy Vietnam north of the 16th parallel and accept the Japanese surrender.
In total, 200,000 of General Lu Han&#x27;s Chinese soldiers occupied north Vietnam starting August 1945. 90,000 arrived by October, the 62nd army came on 26 September to Nam Dinh and Haiphong, later arriving at Lang Son and Cao Bang and the Red River region and Lai Cai were occupied by a column from Yunnan. Vietnamese VNQDD fighters accompanied the Chinese soldiers. Lu Han occupied the French governor general&#x27;s palace after ejecting the French staff under Sainteny.

On 9 October 1945, General Leclerc arrived in Saigon, accompanied by French Colonel Massu&#x27;s &quot;Groupement de marche&quot; unit. Leclerc&#x27;s primary objectives were to restore public order in south Vietnam and to militarize Tonkin (northern Vietnam). Secondary objectives were to explore taking back Chinese-occupied Hanoi, and to negotiate with Việt Minh officials.

While the Chinese soldiers occupied northern Indochina,
Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s Viet Minh tried to appease the Chinese soldiers with welcome parades in Hanoi and Haiphong, while reassuring the Vietnamese people that China supported Vietnam&#x27;s independence. Viet Minh newspapers emphasized the common ancestry (huyết thống) and culture shared by Vietnamese and Chinese, and their common struggle against western imperialists, and expressed admiration for the 1911 revolution and anti-Japanese war which had made it &quot;not the same as feudal China&quot;.

In September 1945, Ho Chi Minh called on the people to contribute gold to purchase weapons for the Viet Minh and also gifts for the Chinese, presenting a golden opium pipe to the Chinese general Lu Han. Lu Han pressured Ho Chi Minh for rice to feed the Chinese occupation force. Rice sent to Cochinchina by the French in October 1945 was divided by Ho Chi Minh, with only one third to the northern Vietnamese and two thirds to the Chinese. After 18 December 1945, elections were postponed for 15 days in response to a demand by Chinese general Chen Xiuhe to allow the Dong Minh Hoi and VNQDD to prepare.

Beyond their food quota, the occupiers seized several rice stockpiles and other private and public goods, and were accused of rapes, beatings, occupying private dwellings, and burning down others, resulting only in apologies or partial compensation. By contrast, Vietnamese crimes against the Chinese were fully investigated, to the extent of executions for some Vietnamese who attacked Chinese soldiers.

While Chiang Kai-shek, Xiao Wen (Hsiao Wen) and the Kuomintang Chinese government were uninterested in occupying Vietnam beyond the allotted time period and involving itself in the war between the Viet Minh and the French, the Yunnan warlord Lu Han wanted to establish a Chinese trusteeship of Vietnam under the principles of the Atlantic Charter with the aim of eventually preparing Vietnam for independence.
Ho Chi Minh sent a cable on 17 October 1945 to American President Harry S. Truman calling on him, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, Premier Joseph Stalin and Prime Minister Clement Attlee to go to the United Nations against France and demand that they not be allowed to return to occupy Vietnam, accusing France of having sold out and cheated the Allies by surrendering Indochina to Japan. Ho Chi Minh blamed Dong Minh Hoi and VNDQQ for signing the agreement with France which allowed its soldiers to return to Vietnam.

Chinese communist guerrilla leader Chu Chia-pi visited northern Vietnam multiple times in 1945 and helped the Viet Minh fight against the French from Yunnan.
Chiang Kai-shek forced the contentious French and Việt Minh to come to terms in the Ho–Sainteny agreement. In February 1946, he also forced the French to surrender all of their concessions and ports in China, including Shanghai, in exchange for Chinese troops withdrawing from northern Indochina and allowing French troops to reoccupy the region starting in March 1946.

This left the VNQDĐ without support, and they were suppressed by Việt Minh and French troops. The Việt Minh massacred thousands of VNQDĐ members and other nationalists in a large-scale purge.

=== Intra-Vietnamese factions ===
In addition to British support, the French also received assistance from various southern groups that modern historians consider unambiguously Vietnamese.
After the August Revolution, the armed militias from the religious Hòa Hảo sect backed by the Japanese were in direct conflict with the Viet Minh who sought to take full control of the country. This ultimately led to the assassination of their leader in April 1947.

The Bình Xuyên organized crime group also sought power in the country and although they initially fought alongside the Việt Minh, they would later support Bảo Đại.
Militias from the Cao Đài sect, which had initially joined the Viet Minh in their struggle against the return of the French, made a truce with France when their leader was captured on 6 June 1946. The Viet Minh later attacked the Cao Đài after open conflict had erupted with France, which led them to join the French side.

Vietnamese society also polarized along ethnic lines: the Nung minority assisted the French, while the Tay assisted the Việt Minh.

== Course of the war ==
=== War breaks out (1946) ===

In March 1946, a preliminary accord signed between the French and Ho Chi Minh which acknowledged the DRV as a free state within an Indochinese Federation in a &quot;French Union&quot; and allowed a limited number of French troops within its borders to replace the Chinese forces which started gradually returning to China. In further negotiations, the French would seek to ratify Vietnam&#x27;s position within the Union and the Vietnamese main priorities were preserving their independence and the reunification with the Republic of Cochinchina, which had been created by High Commissioner Georges d&#x27;Argenlieu in June. In September, once main negotiations had broken down in Paris over these two key issues, Ho Chi Minh and Marius Moutet, the French Minister of the Colonies, signed a temporary modus vivendi which reaffirmed the March Accord, although no specifications were made on the issue of a Nam Bộ (Cochinchina) reunification referendum and negotiations for a definitive treaty were set to begin no later than January 1947.

In the north, an uneasy peace had been maintained during the negotiations, in November however, fighting broke out in Haiphong between the Việt Minh government and the French over a conflict of interest in import duty at the port. On November 23, 1946, the French fleet bombarded the Vietnamese sections of the city killing 6,000 Vietnamese civilians in one afternoon. The Việt Minh quickly agreed to a cease-fire and left the cities. This is known as the Haiphong incident.
There was never any intention among the Vietnamese to give up, as General Võ Nguyên Giáp soon brought up 30,000 men to attack the city. Although the French were outnumbered, their superior weaponry and naval support made any Việt Minh attack unsuccessful. In 19 December, hostilities between the Việt Minh and the French broke out in Hanoi, and Hồ Chí Minh, along with his government, was forced to evacuate the capital in favor of remote forested and mountainous areas. Guerrilla warfare ensued, with the French controlling most of the country except far-flung areas. By January the following year, most provincial capitals had fallen to the French, while Hue fell in February after a six-week siege.

=== French offensives, creation of the State of Vietnam (1947–1949) ===

In 1947, Hồ Chí Minh and General Võ Nguyên Giáp retreated with his command into the Việt Bắc, the mountainous forests of northern Vietnam. By March, France had taken control of the main population centers in the country. The French chose not to pursue the Việt Minh before the beginning of the seasonal rains in May, and military operations were postponed until their conclusion.

Come October, the French launched Operation Léa with the objective of swiftly putting an end to the resistance movement by taking out the Vietnamese main battle units and the Việt Minh leadership at their base in Bắc Kạn. Léa was followed by Operation Ceinture in November, with similar aims. As a result of the French offensive, the Việt Minh would end up losing valuable resources and suffering heavy losses, 7,200–9,500 KIA. Nevertheless, both operations failed to capture Hồ Chí Minh and his key lieutenants as intended, and the main Vietnamese battle units managed to survive.

In 1948, France started looking for means of opposing the Việt Minh politically, with an alternative government led by former emperor Bảo Đại to lead an &quot;autonomous&quot; government within the French Union of nations. This new state ruled over northern and central Vietnam, excluding the colony of Cochinchina, and had limited autonomy. This initial accord with the French was decried by non-Communist nationalists and Bảo Đại withdrew from the agreement. It would not be until March 1949 that the French would concede on the issue of unification and a final agreement would be reached.

Two years prior, the French had refused Ho&#x27;s proposal of a similar status within the French Union, albeit with some restrictions on French power and the latter&#x27;s eventual withdrawal from Vietnam. However, they were willing to deal with Bảo Đại as he represented a non-radical option who could rally behind him the non-Communist nationalist movement.
In January 1950, France officially recognized the nominal &quot;independence&quot; of the unified State of Vietnam, led by Bảo Đại, as an associated state within the French Union. However, France still controlled all foreign policy, every defense issue and would have a French Union army stationed in the country with complete freedom of movement. Within the framework of the French Union, France also granted independence to the other nations in Indochina, the Kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia.

In January 1949, the Vietnamese National Army was created to go along the formation of the new Vietnamese associated state. This was meant to bolster French numbers as their army found itself outnumbered by the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam at this point in the war. To this end, the CEFEO provided some of its officers to lead these new divisions.

=== Việt Minh reorganization (1949–1950) ===

Throughout 1948 and 1949, the Việt Minh engaged in ambushes and sabotage of French convoys and infrastructure. Meanwhile, the French government was still looking for a political solution and major military operations stalled for a lack of manpower.
With the triumph of the communists in China&#x27;s civil war in October 1949, the Vietnamese communists gained a major political ally on their northern border, who supported them with advisers, weapons and supplies along with camps where new recruits were trained. Between 1950 and 1951, Giap re-organized his local forces into five full conventional infantry divisions, the 304th, 308th, 312th, 316th and the 320th.

In January 1950, Ho&#x27;s government gained recognition from China and the Soviet Union. Shortly after in March, the government of Bảo Đại gained recognition by the United States and the United Kingdom. Along with Mao Zedong&#x27;s victory in China, this gesture by the main Communist powers, played a part in shifting the US view of the war, which began to be seen as part of the global struggle against Communism. Starting in May, the United States began to provide military aid to France in the form of weaponry and military observers.

In June 1950, the Korean War broke out between communist North Korea (DPRK) supported by China and the Soviet Union, and South Korea (ROK) supported by the United States and its allies in the UN. The Cold War was turning &#x27;hot&#x27; in East Asia, and the American government feared communist domination of the entire region would have deep implications for American interests. The US became strongly opposed to the government of Hồ Chí Minh, in part, because it was supported and supplied by China.
Throughout 1950, the DRV would seek to secure its control over the Chinese border, which would allow for a greater flow of supplies. In February, Giáp launched &quot;Operation Lê Hong Phong I&quot;, taking control of the border town of Lào Cai, in the high valley of the Red River and by April, most of the northeastern border was under Viet-Minh control, save for a string of posts along the eastern Tonkinese frontier; Cao Bằng, Đông Khê, Thất Khê and Lạng Sơn, from North to South, connected by the Colonial Route 4 (RC 4).

On September 16 the Viet Minh launched a new offensive, &quot;Operation Lê Hong Phong II&quot;, along this route under the command of General Hoàng Văn Thái. The Viet Minh attacked Đông Khê, which fell two days later. In response, the French decided to evacuate Cao Bằng, which had become isolated. Soldiers and civilians were to march south and join a group marching north from Thất Khê tasked with recapturing the lost position. However, despite having been ordered to destroy all equipment, the commander of the Cao Bằng force decided to bring along its artillery when they left on October 3, causing delays and making them vulnerable to ambushes. The two forces approached Đông Khê four days later but by were eventually encircled and defeated. This operation would cost the French around 6,000 soldiers.
On October 17, faced with the PAVN&#x27;s demonstrated ability to fight a conventional battle, the French command decided to abandon Lạng Sơn before it could come under attack, leaving behind considerable amounts of military supplies. The Viet-Minh now controlled most of the northern half of Tonkin.

=== Renewed French success (January–June 1951) ===

A new French commander in chief and high commissioner, General Jean Marie de Lattre de Tassigny, was appointed in December 1950. With him began the construction of a defensive line of fortifications from Hanoi to the Gulf of Tonkin, around the Red River Delta, to protect Tonkin against a possible Chinese invasion and prevent Việt Minh infiltration. It became known as the De Lattre Line. In 1950 and 1951, de Lattre implemented scorched earth tactics in an effort to limit Việt Minh access to food and other supplies. French forces burned crops in areas of Việt Minh activity. These tactics increased the anger of the Vietnamese people against the French and were a strategic failure.

In late 1950 Giáp decided to go on a &quot;general counteroffensive&quot;, seeking the final defeat of the French. On January 13, 1951, he moved the 308th and 312th Divisions, with more than 20,000 men, to attack Vĩnh Yên, 30 miles (48 km) northwest of Hanoi, which was manned by 6,000 French troops. Considered the first set-piece battle of the war, the Vietnamese saw initial success, although as the battle progressed, French aerial supremacy proved decisive as reinforcements flew in from the rest of Indochina and all available aircraft capable of dropping bombs was utilized to carry out what would be the largest aerial bombardment of the war. By noon of January 17, Giáp&#x27;s troops withdrew in defeat. The Vietnamese had suffered 5,000–6,000 deaths and 500 combatants were captured.

Giáp tried again to break the French defensive line, this time north-east of Haiphong in an attempt to cut the French access to the port city. On March 23, the Việt Minh&#x27;s 316th Division, composed of 11,000 men, with the partly rebuilt 308th and 312th Divisions in reserve, launched an attack on Mạo Khê. With instances of hand-to-hand combat, the French, supported by paratroopers and naval artillery, repelled the attack and the Vietnamese were beaten by the morning of March 28. About 1,500 – 3,000 Việt Minh soldiers were killed.

Giáp launched yet another attack, the Battle of the Day River, on May 29 with the 304th Division at Phủ Lý, the 308th Division at Ninh Bình, and the main attack delivered by the 320th Division at Phát Diệm south of Hanoi. The attacks fared no better and the three divisions lost heavily. Taking advantage of this, de Lattre mounted his counteroffensive against the demoralized Việt Minh, driving them back into the forests and eliminating the enemy pockets in the Red River Delta by June 18, costing the Việt Minh over 10,000 killed.

Every effort by Võ Nguyên Giáp to break the De Lattre Line failed, and every attack he made was answered by a French counter-attack that destroyed his forces. Việt Minh casualties rose alarmingly during this period, leading some to question the leadership of the Communist government, even within the party. However, any benefit this may have reaped for France was negated by the increasing domestic opposition to the war in France.

=== Stalemate (July 1951–1953) ===
On July 31, French General Charles Chanson was assassinated during a propaganda suicide attack at Sa Đéc in South Vietnam that was blamed on the Việt Minh although it was argued in some quarters that Cao Đài nationalist Trình Minh Thế could have been involved in its planning.
Following the Viet Minh&#x27;s defeats on the Hanoi perimeter, De Lattre decided to seize the city of Hòa Bình, 20 miles (32 km) west of the De Lattre Line, in an attempt to hinder the flow of supplies between Tonkin, which received direct Chinese support, and central and southern Vietnam. It also aimed to maintain the allegiance of the Muong troops. The city was captured by a parachute drop on November 14.

The ensuing battle became increasingly costly to the French and after De Lattre fell ill from cancer and returned to Paris for treatment where he would die shortly thereafter in January 1952, his replacement as the overall commander of French forces in Indochina, General Raoul Salan, decided to pull back from the Hòa Bình salient. The French lost nearly 5,000 men and the Viet Minh &quot;at least that number&quot; according to historian Phillip P. Davidson, while Spencer C. Tucker claims 894 French killed and missing and 9,000 Viet Minh casualties. This campaign showed that the war was far from over.

Throughout the war theater, the Việt Minh cut French supply lines and wore down the resolve of the French forces. There were continued raids, skirmishes and guerrilla attacks, but through most of the rest of the year each side withdrew to prepare for larger operations. In the Battle of Nà Sản, starting on October 2, French commanders began using &quot;hedgehog&quot; tactics, consisting in setting up well-defended outposts to get the Việt Minh out of the forests and force them to fight conventional battles instead of using guerrilla tactics.

On October 17, 1952, Giáp launched attacks against the French garrisons along Nghĩa Lộ, northwest of Hanoi, and overran much of the Black River valley, except for the airfield of Nà Sản where a strong French garrison entrenched. Giáp by now had control over most of Tonkin beyond the De Lattre Line. Raoul Salan, seeing the situation as critical, launched Operation Lorraine along the Clear River to force Giáp to relieve pressure on the Nghĩa Lộ outposts.
On October 29, 1952, in the largest operation in Indochina to date, 30,000 French Union soldiers moved out from the De Lattre Line to attack the Việt Minh supply dumps at Phú Yên. Salan took Phú Thọ on November 5, and Phu Doan on November 9 by a parachute drop, and finally Phú Yên on November 13. Giáp at first did not react to the French offensive. He planned to wait until their supply lines were overextended and then cut them off from the Red River Delta.

Salan correctly guessed what the Việt Minh were up to and cancelled the operation on November 14, beginning to withdraw back to the De Lattre Line. The only major fighting during the operation came during the withdrawal, when the Việt Minh ambushed the French column at Chan Muong on November 17. The road was cleared after a bayonet charge by the Indochinese March Battalion, and the withdrawal could continue. The French lost around 1,200 men during the whole operation, most of them during the Chan Muong ambush. The operation was partially successful, proving that the French could strike out at targets outside the De Lattre Line. However, it failed to divert the Việt Minh offensive or seriously damage its logistical network.
On April 9, 1953, Giáp, after having failed repeatedly in direct attacks on French positions in Vietnam, changed strategy and began to pressure the French by invading Laos, surrounding and defeating several French outposts such as Muong Khoua. In May, General Henri Navarre replaced Salan as supreme commander of French forces in Indochina. He reported to the French government &quot;... that there was no possibility of winning the war in Indo-China&quot;, saying that the best the French could hope for was a stalemate.

Through the Navarre Plan, French forces and the Vietnamese National Army sought to use their advantage in technology and arms to hold cities and key roads, thereby hoping to force the Việt Minh into an impasse and negotiation. Per this strategy, French forces fortified the town of Điện Biên Phủ in an effort to block the Việt Minh&#x27;s connections with Laos and Việt Minh bases there. The town was located along a main route between Hanoi and Vientiane and was ringed by mountains.

Operation Castor was launched on November 20, 1953, with 1,800 men of the French 1st and 2nd Airborne Battalions dropping into the valley of Điện Biên Phủ and sweeping aside the local Việt Minh garrison. The paratroopers gained control of a heart-shaped valley long and wide surrounded by heavily wooded mountains. Encountering little opposition, the French and Tai units operating from Lai Châu to the north patrolled the mountains.

The operation was a tactical success for the French. However, Giáp, seeing the weakness of the French position, started moving most of his forces from the De Lattre Line to Điện Biên Phủ. From December 1953 to March 1964, the Việt Minh concentrated more than 40,000 troops to encircle the 15,000 French troops at Điện Biên Phủ.

The fight for control of Điện Biên Phủ was the longest and hardest battle for the French Far East Expeditionary Corps and its veterans described the battle as &quot;57 Days of Hell&quot;.

=== French defeat at Dien Bien Phu (1954) ===

The Battle of Dien Bien Phu took place in 1954 between Việt Minh forces under Võ Nguyên Giáp, supported by China and the Soviet Union, and the French Union&#x27;s French Far East Expeditionary Corps, supported by US financing and Indochinese allies. The battle was fought near the village of Điện Biên Phủ in northern Vietnam and became the last major battle between the French and the Vietnamese in the First Indochina War.

The battle began on March 13 when the Việt Minh began attacks to isolate French strong points at Điện Biên Phủ . Việt Minh artillery damaged both the main and secondary airfields that the French were using to fly in supplies. With French supply lines interrupted, the French position became untenable, particularly when the advent of the monsoon season made dropping supplies and reinforcements by parachute difficult. By late April, French forces held only three strong points. With defeat imminent, the French sought to hold on until the opening of the Geneva peace meeting on April 26. The last French offensive took place on May 4, but it was ineffective. The Việt Minh then began to hammer the outpost with newly supplied Soviet Katyusha rockets.

On May 6, the Việt Minh began their final attack. French forces were eventually overrun by a huge frontal assault. General Cogny, based in Hanoi, ordered General de Castries, who was commanding the outpost, to cease fire at 5:30 pm and to destroy all matériel (weapons, transmissions, etc.) to deny their use to the enemy. A formal order was given to not use the white flag so that the action would be considered a ceasefire instead of a surrender. Much of the fighting ended on May 7; however, the ceasefire was not respected on Isabelle, the isolated southern position, where the battle lasted until May 8, 1:00 am.
At least 2,200 members of the 20,000-strong French forces died, and another 1,729 were reported missing after the battle, and 11,721 were captured. The Viet Minh suffered approximately 25,000 casualties over the course of the battle, with as many as 10,000 Viet Minh personnel having been killed in the battle. The French prisoners taken at Điện Biên Phủ were the greatest number the Việt Minh had ever captured: one-third of the total captured during the entire war.

Dien Bien Phu was a serious defeat for the French and was the decisive battle of the Indochina war. The battle would thus heavily influence the outcome of the 1954 Geneva accords.

===Geneva Conference===

Negotiations between France and the Việt Minh started in Geneva in April 1954 at the Geneva Conference, during which time the French Union and the Việt Minh were fighting a battle at Điện Biên Phủ. In France, Pierre Mendès France, opponent of the war since 1950, had been invested as Prime Minister on June 17, 1954, on a promise to put an end to the war, reaching a ceasefire in four months:
Today it seems we can be reunited in a will for peace that may express the aspirations of our country ... Since already several years, a compromise peace, a peace negotiated with the opponent seemed to me commanded by the facts, while it commanded, in return, to put back in order our finances, the recovery of our economy and its expansion. Because this war placed on our country an unbearable burden. And here appears today a new and formidable threat: if the Indochina conflict is not resolved—and settled very fast—it is the risk of war, of international war and maybe atomic, that we must foresee. It is because I wanted a better peace that I wanted it earlier, when we had more assets. But even now there is some renouncings or abandons that the situation does not comprise. France does not have to accept and will not accept settlement which would be incompatible with its more vital interests [applauding on certain seats of the Assembly on the left and at the extreme right]. France will remain present in Far-Orient. Neither our allies, nor our opponents must conserve the least doubt on the signification of our determination. A negotiation has been engaged in Geneva ... I have longly studied the report ... consulted the most qualified military and diplomatic experts. My conviction that a pacific settlement of the conflict is possible has been confirmed. A &quot;cease-fire&quot; must henceforth intervene quickly. The government which I will form will fix itself—and will fix to its opponents—a delay of 4 weeks to reach it. We are today on 17th of June. I will present myself before you before the 20th of July ... If no satisfying solution has been reached at this date, you will be freed from the contract which would have tied us together, and my government will give its dismissal to the President of the Republic. 

===End of the war===
One month after Điện Biên Phủ, the composite Groupe Mobile 100 (GM100) of the French Union forces evacuated the An Khê outpost. They were ambushed by a larger Việt Minh force at the Battle of Mang Yang Pass on June 24, and again at the Battle of Chu Dreh Pass which took place on July 17 suffering heavy losses; this being the last battle of the war, as three days later the Geneva accords took place.

==Aftermath==
===Partition===

The Geneva Conference on July 21, 1954, recognized the 17th parallel north as a &quot;provisional military demarcation line&quot;, temporarily dividing the country into two zones, communist North Vietnam and pro-Western South Vietnam.

In August Operation Passage to Freedom began, consisting of the evacuation of Catholic and other Vietnamese civilians from communist North Vietnamese persecution.

The Geneva Accords promised elections in 1956 to determine a national government for a united Vietnam. Neither the United States government nor Ngô Đình Diệm&#x27;s State of Vietnam signed anything at the 1954 Geneva Conference. With respect to the question of reunification, the non-communist Vietnamese delegation objected strenuously to any division of Vietnam, but lost out when the French accepted the proposal of Việt Minh delegate Phạm Văn Đồng, who proposed that Vietnam eventually be united by elections under the supervision of &quot;local commissions&quot;. The United States countered with what became known as the &quot;American Plan&quot;, with the support of South Vietnam and the United Kingdom. It provided for unification elections under the supervision of the United Nations, but was rejected by the Soviet delegation. From his home in France, Bảo Đại appointed Ngô Đình Diệm as Prime Minister of South Vietnam. With American support, in 1955 Diem used a referendum to remove the former Emperor and declare himself the president of the Republic of Vietnam.

When the elections failed to occur, Việt Minh cadres who stayed behind in South Vietnam were activated and started to fight the government. North Vietnam also invaded and occupied portions of Laos to assist in supplying the National Liberation Front guerrillas fighting in South Vietnam. The war gradually escalated into the Second Indochina War, more commonly known as the &quot;Vietnam War&quot; in the West and the &quot;American War&quot; in Vietnam.

===Effect on French colonies===
The Viet Minh victory in the war had an inspirational effect to independence movements in various French colonies worldwide, most notably the FLN in Algeria. The Algerian War broke out on 1 November 1954, only six months after the Geneva Conference. Benyoucef Benkhedda, later became the head of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic, praised the Viet Minh feat at Dien Bien Phu as &quot;a powerful incentive to all who thought immediate insurrection the only possible strategy&quot;. The French Communist Party played an even stronger role by supplying the National Liberation Front (FLN) rebels with intelligence documents and financial aid. They were called &quot;the suitcase carriers&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

In the French news, the Indochina War was presented as a direct continuation of the Korean War, where France had fought: a UN French battalion, incorporated in a U.S. unit in Korea, was later involved in the Battle of Mang Yang Pass of June and July 1954. In an interview taped in May 2004, General Marcel Bigeard (6th BPC) argues that &quot;one of the deepest mistakes done by the French during the war was the propaganda telling you are fighting for Freedom, you are fighting against Communism&quot;, hence the sacrifice of volunteers during the climactic battle of Dien Bien Phu. In the latest days of the siege, 652 non-paratrooper soldiers from all army corps from cavalry to infantry to artillery dropped for the first and last time of their life to support their comrades. The Cold War excuse was later used by General Maurice Challe through his famous &quot;Do you want Mers El Kébir and Algiers to become Soviet bases as soon as tomorrow?&quot;, during the Generals&#x27; putsch (Algerian War) of 1961, with limited effect though.

== Atrocities ==

Atrocities occurred in the conflict long before France ratified the 1949 Geneva Conventions on June 28, 1951, in which such acts committed afterwards in violation of the Conventions&#x27; provisions in force became war crimes. Common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions contains a minimum protection that only applies to humane treatment in a non-international conflict (i.e., war by a state against non-state armed groups or between non-state armed groups themselves). For the purpose of this section, however, atrocities committed before or after France&#x27;s ratification of the 1949 Geneva Conventions are included.

===French===
During the war, there were many instances of war rapes against Vietnamese civilians by French soldiers. This occurred in Saigon, alongside robberies and killings, following the return of the French in August 1945. Vietnamese women were also raped by French soldiers in northern Vietnam in 1948, following the defeat of the Viet Minh, including in Bảo Hà, Bảo Yên District, Lào Cai province and Phu Lu. This led to 400 French-trained Vietnamese defecting to the Viet Minh June 1948. French killings of Vietnamese civilians were reported, many of them were caused by the tendency of Viet Minh troops to hide among civilian settlements. One of the largest massacres by French troops was the Mỹ Trạch massacre of November 29, 1947, in which French soldiers killed over 200 women and children. Regarding this massacre and other atrocities during the conflict, Christopher Goscha wrote in &quot;The Penguin History of Modern Vietnam&quot;:
The French Army also utilized torture against Việt Minh prisoners. Benjamin Valentino estimates that the French were responsible for 60,000 to 250,000 civilian deaths.

=== Viet Minh ===
According to Arthur J. Dommen, the Việt Minh assassinated 100,000–150,000 civilians during the war out of a total civilian death toll of 400,000.
Viet Minh militants employed terrorist attacks throughout the conflict as a systematic practice, often targeting European and Eurasian civilians. One of the worst attacks on Europeans was on 21 July 1952, when Viet Minh militants, using grenades, Sten guns, and machetes, massacred twenty unarmed people at a military hospital in Cap St. Jacques—eight officers on sick leave, six children, four Vietnamese servants, and two women.

Many French Union and Vietnamese National Army prisoners died in the Việt Minh POW camps as a result of torture. In the Boudarel Affair, French Communist militant Georges Boudarel was discovered to have used brainwashing and torture against French Union POWs in Việt Minh reeducation camps. The French national association of POWs brought Boudarel to court for a war crime charge.

== French domestic situation ==
The 1946 Constitution creating the Fourth Republic (1946–1958) made France a parliamentary republic. Because of the political context, it could find stability only by an alliance between the three dominant
parties: the Christian Democratic Popular Republican Movement (MRP), the French Communist Party (PCF) and the socialist French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO). Known as &quot;tripartisme&quot;, this alliance briefly lasted until the May 1947 crisis, with the expulsion from Paul Ramadier&#x27;s SFIO government of the PCF ministers, marking the official start of the Cold War in France. This had the effect of weakening the regime, with the two most significant movements of this period, Communism and Gaullism, in opposition.

A strong anti-war movement came into existence in France driven mostly by the powerful French Communist Party (outpowering the socialists) and its young militant associations, major trade unions such as the General Confederation of Labour, and notable leftist intellectuals. The first occurrence was probably at the National Assembly on March 21, 1947, when the communist deputies refused to back the military credits for Indochina. The following year a pacifist event was organized, the &quot;1st Worldwide Congress of Peace Partisans&quot; (, the World Peace Council&#x27;s predecessor), which took place March 25–28, 1948, in Paris, with the French communist Nobel laureate atomic physicist Frédéric Joliot-Curie as president. Later, on April 28, 1950, Joliot-Curie would be dismissed from the military and civilian Atomic Energy Commission for political reasons.
Young communist militants (UJRF) were also accused of sabotage actions like the famous Henri Martin affair and the case of Raymonde Dien, who was jailed one year for having blocked an ammunition train, with the help of other militants, in order to prevent the supply of French forces in Indochina in February 1950.
Similar actions against trains occurred in Roanne, Charleville, Marseille, and Paris. Even ammunition sabotage by PCF agents has been reported, such as grenades exploding in the hands of legionaries. These actions became such a cause for concern by 1950 that the French Assembly voted a law against sabotage between March 2–8. At this session tension was so high between politicians that fighting ensued in the assembly following communist deputies&#x27; speeches against the Indochinese policy. This month saw the French navy mariner and communist militant Henri Martin arrested by military police and jailed for five years for sabotage and propaganda operations in Toulon&#x27;s arsenal. On May 5 communist Ministers were dismissed from the government, marking the end of Tripartism. A few months later on November 11, 1950, the French Communist Party leader Maurice Thorez went to Moscow.

Some military officers involved in the Revers Report scandal (&#x27;) such as Salan were pessimistic about the way the war was being conducted, with multiple political-military scandals all happening during the war, starting with the Generals&#x27; Affair (&#x27;) from September 1949 to November 1950. As a result, General Georges Revers was dismissed in December 1949 and socialist Defense Ministry Jules Moch (SFIO) was brought on court by the National Assembly on November 28, 1950. The scandal started the commercial success of the first French news magazine, &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot;, created in 1953. The third scandal was financial-political, concerning military corruption, money and arms trading involving both the French Union army and the Việt Minh, known as the Piastres affair.

By 1954, despite official propaganda presenting the war as a &quot;crusade against communism&quot;, the war in Indochina was still growing unpopular with the French public. The political stagnation in the Fourth Republic meant that France was unable to extract itself from the conflict.

Unlikely alliances had to be made between left- and right-wing parties in order to form a government invested by the National Assembly, resulting in parliamentary instability, with 14 prime ministers in succession between 1947 and 1954. The rapid turnover of governments (there were 17 different governments during the war) left France unable to prosecute the war with any consistent policy, according to veteran General René de Biré (who was a lieutenant at Dien Bien Phu). France was increasingly unable to afford the costly conflict in Indochina and, by 1954, the United States was paying 80% of France&#x27;s war effort, which was $3,000,000 per day in 1952.

==French Union involvement==

By 1946, France headed the French Union. As successive governments had forbidden the sending of metropolitan troops, the French Far East Expeditionary Corps (CEFEO) was created in March 1945. The Union gathered combatants from almost all French territories made of colonies, protectorates and associated states (Algeria, Morocco, Madagascar, Senegal, Tunisia, etc.) to fight in French Indochina, which was then occupied by the Japanese. About 325,000 of the 500,000 French troops were Indochinese, almost all of whom were used in conventional units.
French West Africa (&#x27;, AOF) was a federation of African colonies. Senegalese and other African troops were sent to fight in Indochina. Some African alumni were trained in the Infantry Instruction Center no.2 (&#x27;) located in southern Vietnam. Senegalese of the Colonial Artillery fought at the siege of Dien Bien Phu. As a French colony (later a full province), French Algeria sent local troops to Indochina including several RTA (&#x27;) light infantry battalions. Morocco was a French protectorate and sent troops to support the French effort in Indochina. Moroccan troops were part of light infantry RTMs (&#x27;) for the &quot;Moroccan Sharpshooters Regiment&quot;.
As a French protectorate, Bizerte, Tunisia, was a major French base. Tunisian troops, mostly RTT (&quot;&quot;), were sent to Indochina. Part of French Indochina, then part of the French Union and later an associated state, Laos fought the communists along with French forces. The role played by Laotian troops in the conflict was depicted by veteran Pierre Schoendoerffer&#x27;s famous &quot;317th Platoon&quot; released in 1964. The French Indochina state of Cambodia also played a role during the Indochina War through the Khmer Royal Army, which had been formed in 1946 in an agreement signed with the French.

While Bảo Đại&#x27;s State of Vietnam (formerly Annam, Tonkin, Cochinchina) had the Vietnamese National Army supporting the French forces, some minorities were trained and organized as regular battalions (mostly infantry &quot;tirailleurs&quot;) that fought with French forces against the Việt Minh. The Tai Battalion 2 (BT2, &quot;2e Bataillon Thai&quot;) is infamous for its desertion during the siege of Dien Bien Phu. Propaganda leaflets written in Tai and French sent by the Việt Minh were found in the deserted positions and trenches. Such deserters were called the &quot;Nam Yum rats&quot; by Bigeard during the siege, as they hid close to the Nam Yum river during the day and searched at night for supply drops. Another allied minority was the Muong people (&quot;Mường&quot;). The 1st Muong Battalion (&quot;&quot;) was awarded the &quot;Croix de guerre des théâtres d&#x27;opérations extérieures&quot; after the victorious Battle of Vĩnh Yên in 1951.

In the 1950s, the French established secret commando groups based on loyal Montagnard ethnic minorities referred to as &quot;partisans&quot; or &quot;maquisards&quot;, called the &quot;Groupement de Commandos Mixtes Aéroportés&quot; (Composite Airborne Commando Group or GCMA), later renamed &quot;Groupement Mixte d&#x27;Intervention&quot; (GMI, or Mixed Intervention Group), directed by the SDECE counter-intelligence service. The SDECE&#x27;s &quot;Service Action&quot; GCMA used both commando and guerrilla techniques and operated in intelligence and secret missions from 1950 to 1955. Declassified information about the GCMA includes the name of its commander, famous Colonel Roger Trinquier, and a mission on April 30, 1954, when Jedburgh veteran Captain Sassi led the Meo partisans of the GCMA Malo-Servan in Operation Condor during the siege of Dien Bien Phu.

In 1951, Adjutant-Chief Vandenberghe from the 6th Colonial Infantry Regiment (6e RIC) created the &quot;Commando Vanden&quot; (aka &quot;Black Tigers&quot;, aka &quot;North Vietnam Commando #24&quot;) based in Nam Định. Recruits were volunteers from the Thổ people, Nùng people and Miao people. This commando unit wore Việt Minh black uniforms to confuse the enemy and used techniques of the experienced Bo doi (&quot;Bộ đội&quot;, regular army) and Du Kich (guerrilla unit). Việt Minh prisoners were recruited in POW camps. The commando was awarded the &quot;Croix de Guerre des TOE&quot; with palm in July 1951; however, Vandenberghe was betrayed by a Việt Minh recruit, commander Nguien Tinh Khoi (308th Division&#x27;s 56th Regiment), who assassinated him (and his Vietnamese fiancée) with external help on the night of January 5, 1952. Coolies and POWs known as &quot;PIM&quot; (&quot;&quot;, which is basically the same as POW) were civilians used by the army as logistical support personnel. During the battle of Dien Bien Phu, coolies were in charge of burying the corpses—during the first days only, after they were abandoned, hence giving off a terrible smell, according to veterans—and they had the dangerous job of gathering supply packets delivered in drop zones while the Việt Minh artillery was firing hard to destroy the crates. The Việt Minh also used thousands of coolies to carry the Chu-Luc (regional units) supplies and ammunition during assaults. The PIM were civilian males old enough to join Bảo Đại&#x27;s army. They were captured in enemy-controlled villages, and those who refused to join the State of Vietnam&#x27;s army were considered prisoners or used as coolies to support a given regiment.

==Foreign involvement==
===Japanese volunteers===
Many former Imperial Japanese Army soldiers fought alongside the Việt Minh—perhaps as many as 5,000 volunteered their services throughout the war. These Japanese soldiers had stayed behind in Indochina after World War II concluded in 1945. The occupying British authorities then repatriated most of the rest of the 50,000 Japanese troops back to Japan. For those that stayed behind, supporting the Việt Minh became a more attractive idea than returning to a defeated and occupied homeland. In addition the Việt Minh had minimal experience in warfare or government so the advice of the Japanese was welcome. Some of the Japanese were ex-Kenpeitai who were wanted for questioning by Allied authorities. Giap arranged for them all to receive Vietnamese citizenship and false identification papers. Some Japanese were captured by the Việt Minh during the last months of World War II and were recruited into their ranks.
Most of the Japanese officers who stayed served as military instructors for the Việt Minh forces, most notably at the Quảng Ngãi Army Academy. They imparted necessary conventional military knowledge – such as how to conduct assaults, night attacks, company/battalion level exercises, commanding, tactics, navigation, communications and movements. A few, however, actively led Vietnamese forces into combat. The French also identified eleven Japanese nurses and two doctors working for the Việt Minh in northern Vietnam in 1951. The Yasukuni Shrine commemorates a number of Japanese involved in the First Indochina War.

Notable Japanese officers serving in Việt Minh included:
* Colonel Mukaiyama – reportedly a staff officer in the 38th Army, who became a technical advisor to the Vietnamese. Credited as the leader of Japanese forces in Vietnam; killed in combat in 1946.
* Colonel Masanobu Tsuji – Operations Staff Officer.
* – a staff officer in the 55th Division who had commanded a squadron of its cavalry regiment. Supposedly the youngest major in the Imperial Army at the time, he led a number of volunteers to the Vietnamese cause, becoming a colonel and military advisor to General Nguyễn Sơn. He headed the Quảng Ngãi Military Academy for a while before founding the Tuy Hòa Military Academy, and was killed by a land mine in 1950.
* Major Kanetoshi Toshihide – served with Major Igari in the 2nd Division and followed him to join the Việt Minh; he became Chief of Staff for General Nguyễn Giác Ngộ.
* – a staff officer in the 34th Independent Mixed Brigade; he joined the Viet Minh forces, and was killed in action against the French in 1946. He allegedly conceived the idea of establishing the Quảng Ngãi Military Academy.
* Lieutenant Igari Kazumasa – the commander of an infantry company in the 2nd Division&#x27;s 29th Infantry Regiment; he became an instructor at the Quảng Ngãi Military Academy.
* Lieutenant Kamo Tokuji – a platoon leader under Lieutenant Igari; he also became an instructor at the Quảng Ngãi Military Academy.
* an intelligence officer who was originally supposed to remain behind in Indonesia, but linked up with the 34th Brigade to try to get home, only to end up as an instructor at the Quảng Ngãi Military Academy until 1954.
* 2nd Lieutenant Nakahara Mitsunobu – an intelligence officer of the 34th Independent Mixed Brigade; became a decorated soldier in the Việt Minh forces, and later an instructor at the Quảng Ngãi Military Academy.

=== China ===

The victory of the Chinese communists in December 1949 proved decisive in the course of the war as during the early 1950s guerrilla troops used the southern areas of China as a sanctuary where new troops could be trained and fitted beyond the reach of the French. The Việt Minh successfully carried out several hit-and-run ambushes against French Union military convoys along the Route Coloniale 4 (RC 4) roadway, which ran along the Chinese border, and was a major supply passage in Tonkin (northern Vietnam) for a series of frontier forts. One of the most famous attacks of this nature was the Battle of Cao Bằng of 1947–1949.

China supplied and provided the Việt Minh guerrilla forces with almost every kind of crucial and important supplies and material required, such as food (including thousands of tonnes of rice), money, medics and medical aid and supplies, arms and weapons (ranging from artillery guns (24 of which were used at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu) to rifles and machine-guns), ammunition and explosives and other types of military equipment, including a large part of war-material captured from the then-recently defeated National Revolutionary Army (NRA) of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Nationalist Chinese government following the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. Evidence of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s secret aid and supplies were found hidden in caves during the French military&#x27;s Operation Hirondelle in July 1953. 2,000 military advisors from the PRC and the Soviet Union trained the Việt Minh guerrilla force with the aim of turning it into a full-fledged armed force to fight off their French colonial masters and gain national independence. On top of this, the PRC sent two People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) artillery battalions to fight at the siege of Dien Bien Phu on May 6, 1954, with one battalion operating the Soviet Katyusha multiple-rocket launcher systems (MRLS) against French forces besieged at Dien Bien Phu&#x27;s valley.

From 1950 to 1954 the Chinese government shipped goods, materials, and medicine worth $ billion (in dollars) to Vietnam. From 1950 to 1956 the Chinese government shipped 155,000 small arms, 58 million rounds of ammunition, 4,630 artillery pieces, 1,080,000 artillery shells, 840,000 hand grenades, 1,400,000 uniforms, 1,200 vehicles, 14,000 tons of food, and 26,000 tons of fuel to Vietnam. Mao Zedong considered it necessary to buttress the Viet Minh to secure his country&#x27;s southern flank against potential interference by westerners, while the bulk of the PRC&#x27;s regular military forces participated in the Korean War from 1950 to 1953. After the end of the Korean War and the resolution of the First Taiwan Strait Crisis, China stepped up involvement in the Indochina Wars, viewing the presence of potentially hostile forces in Indochina as the main threat.

===Soviet Union===
The Soviet Union was the other major ally of the Việt Minh, alongside the PRC. Moscow supplied GAZ-built trucks, truck engines and motor-parts, fuel, tyres, many different kinds of arms and weapons (including thousands of Škoda-manufactured light machine-guns of Czech origin), all kinds of ammunition (ranging from rifle to machine-gun ammunition), various types of anti-aircraft guns (such as the 37mm air-defense gun) and even cigarettes and tobacco products. During Operation Hirondelle, French Union paratroopers captured and destroyed many tonnes of Soviet-supplied material destined for Việt Minh use in the area of Ky Lua. According to General Giap, the chief military leader of all Việt Minh forces, the Việt Minh used about 400 Soviet-produced GAZ-51 trucks at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. Because the trucks were concealed and hidden with the use of highly effective camouflage (consisting predominantly of thick vegetation), French Union reconnaissance aircraft were not able to notice them and take note of the effective Việt Minh supply-train. On May 6, 1954, during the siege against French forces at the valley of Dien Bien Phu, Soviet-supplied Katyusha MLRS were successfully fielded against French Union military outposts, destroying enemy troop formations and bases and lowering their morale levels. Together with the PRC, the Soviet Union sent up to 2,000 military advisors to provide training to the Việt Minh guerrilla troops and to turn it into a conventional army.

===United States===
====Mutual Defense Assistance Act (1950–1954)====

At the beginning of the war, the U.S. was neutral in the conflict because of its opposition to European colonialism, because the Việt Minh had recently been U.S. allies, and because, in the context of the Cold War, most of its attention was focused on Europe where Winston Churchill argued an &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; had fallen.

The 1949 victory of Mao Zedong&#x27;s Chinese Communist Party in the Chinese Civil War, the recognition of the DRV by the USSR and the newly formed People&#x27;s Republic of China in January 1950, which prompted the US and the UK to recognize the State of Vietnam in response, and the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship shortly after in February, shifted the US stance on the matter, and the war came to be viewed as another front in the anticommunist struggle.

Indochina, and Southeast Asia more broadly, was declared vital by the U.S. government, and the containment of communism at the southern Chinese border, and, later, Korea, became one of the priorities of American foreign policy as it was believed that the fall of Indochina to communist hands would lead to the loss of other nations in the region. At this time, communism was seen as a uniform bloc, dominated by the Soviet Union. It was feared in Washington that if Ho were to win the war, he would establish a state politically aligned with Moscow, with the Soviets ultimately controlling Vietnamese affairs. This prospect spurred the U.S. to support France in their war effort, primarily through the Mutual Defense Assistance Act. In May 1950, after Chinese communist forces occupied Hainan island, U.S. President Harry S. Truman began covertly authorizing direct financial assistance to the French, and on June 27, 1950, after the outbreak of the Korean War, announced publicly that the U.S. was doing so.

On June 30, 1950, the first U.S. supplies for Indochina were delivered. In September, Truman sent the Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) to Indochina to assist the French. Later, in 1954, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower explained the escalation risk, introducing what he referred to as the &quot;domino principle&quot;, which eventually became the concept of domino theory.
After the Moch–Marshall meeting of September 23, 1950, in Washington, United States, started to support the French Union effort politically, logistically and financially. Officially, US involvement did not include use of armed force.

As the situation at Dien Bien Phu deteriorated in 1954, France requested more support from the United States, including equipment and direct intervention. For instance, on April 4 French Prime Minister Joseph Laniel and Foreign Minister Georges Bidault conveyed to U.S. Ambassador C. Douglas Dillon that &quot;immediate armed intervention of US carrier aircraft at DienBien Phu is now necessary to save the situation&quot;. The United States discussed with allies multiple options, including the use of nuclear weapons. A key concern in the planning was the response of China. While the planning continued, the United States moved an aircraft-carrier task-force, which included the carriers &quot;Boxer&quot; and &quot;Essex&quot;, into the South China Sea between the Philippines and Indochina. However, the leadership of the United States eventually decided that there was not sufficient international or domestic support for the United States to become directly involved in the conflict.

Following the end of the war United States Secretary of State John Foster Dulles denounced Chinese aid to the Việt Minh, and explained that the United States could not act openly because of international pressure, and concluded with the call to &quot;all concerned nations&quot; concerning the necessity of &quot;a collective defense&quot; against &quot;the communist aggression&quot;.

====US Navy assistance (1951–1954)====

 delivered Grumman F8F Bearcat fighter aircraft to Saigon on January 26, 1951.

On March 2, 1951, the United States Navy transferred (LST 490) to the French Navy in Indochina in accordance with the MAAG-led MAP. Renamed RFS &quot;Vulcain&quot; (A-656), she was used in Operation Hirondelle in 1953. carrier delivered Grumman F8F Bearcat aircraft to Saigon on March 26, 1951. During September 1953, (renamed &quot;Bois Belleau&quot;) was lent to France and sent to French Indochina to replace the . She was used to support delta defenders in the Hạ Long Bay operation in May 1954. In August she joined the Franco-American evacuation operation called &quot;Passage to Freedom&quot;.
The same month, the United States delivered additional aircraft, again using USS &quot;Windham Bay&quot;. On April 18, 1954, during the siege of Dien Bien Phu, delivered 25 Korean War AU-1 Corsair aircraft for use by the French Aeronavale in supporting the besieged garrison.

====US Air Force assistance (1952–1954)====

A total of 94 F4U-7s were built for the Aéronavale in 1952, with the last of the batch, the final Corsair built, rolled out in December 1952. The F4U-7s were actually purchased by the U.S. Navy and passed on to the Aéronavale through the U.S. Military Assistance Program (MAP). They were supplemented by 25 ex-U.S.MC AU-1s (previously used in the Korean War) and moved from Yokosuka, Japan, to Tourane Air Base (Da Nang), Vietnam, in April 1952. US Air Force assistance followed in November 1953 when the French commander in Indochina, General Henri Navarre, asked General Chester E. McCarty, commander of the Combat Cargo Division, for 12 Fairchild C-119s for Operation Castor at Dien Bien Phu. The USAF also provided C-124 Globemasters to transport French paratroop reinforcements to Indochina.
Under the codename Project Swivel Chair, on March 3, 1954, 12 C-119s of the 483rd Troop Carrier Wing (&quot;Packet Rats&quot;) based at Ashiya, Japan, were painted with France&#x27;s insignia and loaned to France with 24 CIA pilots for short-term use. Maintenance was carried out by the US Air Force and airlift operations were commanded by McCarty.

==== Central Intelligence Agency covert operations (1953–1954) ====

At the request of the French, the US government tasked the CIA to carry out covert airlift operations to support the French troops in Laos. To that end, during Operation SQUAW, from 5 May to 16 July 1953, the CIA used 12 pilots, officially employed by the (CIA owned) Civil Air Transport airline, to fly equipment on 6 C-119s supplied by the USAF, bearing French colours.
Twenty four Civil Air Transport pilots supplied the French Union garrison during the siege of Dien Bien Phu – airlifting paratroopers, ammunition, artillery pieces, tons of barbed wire, medics and other military materiel. With the reducing Drop zone areas, night operations and anti-aircraft artillery assaults, many of the &quot;packets&quot; fell into Việt Minh hands. The CIA pilots completed 682 airdrops under anti-aircraft fire between March 13 and May 6, 1954. Two CAT pilots, Wallace Bufford and James B. McGovern Jr. were killed in action when their Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar was shot down on May 6, 1954. On February 25, 2005, the French ambassador to the United States, Jean-David Levitte, awarded the seven remaining CIA pilots the Légion d&#x27;honneur.

==== Operation Passage to Freedom (1954) ====

In August 1954, in support of the French navy and the merchant navy, the U.S. Navy launched Operation Passage to Freedom and sent hundreds of ships, including , in order to evacuate non-communist—especially Catholic—Vietnamese refugees from North Vietnam following the July 20, 1954, armistice and partition of Vietnam. Up to 1 million Vietnamese civilians were transported from North to South during this period, with around one-tenth of that number moving in the opposite direction. Loyal Indochinese evacuated to metropolitan France were kept in detention camps.

== Popular culture ==
Although the war was largely treated with indifference in metropolitan France, &quot;the dirty war&quot; has been featured in various films, books and songs. Since its declassification in the 2000s, television documentaries have been released using new perspectives about the U.S. covert involvement and open critics about the French propaganda used during wartime.

The famous Communist propagandist Roman Karmen was in charge of the media exploitation of the battle of Dien Bien Phu. In his documentary, &quot;Vietnam&quot; (Вьетнам, 1955), he staged the famous scene with the raising of the Việt Minh flag over de Castries&#x27; bunker which is similar to the one he staged over the Berlin Reichstag roof during World War II (&quot;Берлин&quot;, 1945) and the S-shaped POW column marching after the battle, where he used the same optical technique he experimented with before when he staged the German prisoners after the Siege of Leningrad (&quot;Ленинград в борьбе&quot;, 1942) and the Battle of Moscow (&quot;Разгром немецких войск под Москвой&quot;, 1942).

Hollywood made a film about Dien Bien Phu in 1955, &quot;Jump into Hell&quot;, directed by David Butler and scripted by Irving Wallace, before his fame as a bestselling novelist. Hollywood also made several films about the war, Robert Florey&#x27;s &quot;Rogues&#x27; Regiment&quot; (1948). Samuel Fuller&#x27;s &quot;China Gate&quot; (1957). and James Clavell&#x27;s &quot;Five Gates to Hell&quot; (1959).

The first French movie about the war, &quot;Shock Patrol&quot; (&quot;Patrouille de Choc&quot;) aka &quot;Patrol Without Hope&quot; (&quot;Patrouille Sans Espoir&quot;) by Claude Bernard-Aubert, came out in 1956. The French censor cut some violent scenes and made the director change the end of his movie which was seen as &quot;too pessimistic&quot;. Léo Joannon&#x27;s film &quot;Fort du Fou&quot; (Fort of the Mad) /&quot;Outpost in Indochina&quot; was released in 1963. Another film was &quot;The 317th Platoon&quot; (&quot;La 317ème Section&quot;) was released in 1964, it was directed by Indochina War (and siege of Dien Bien Phu) veteran Pierre Schoendoerffer. Schoendoerffer has since become a media specialist about the Indochina War and has focused his production on realistic war movies. He was cameraman for the army (&quot;Cinematographic Service of the Armies&quot;, SCA) during his duty time; moreover, as he had covered the Vietnam War he released &quot;The Anderson Platoon&quot;, which won the Academy Award for Documentary Feature.
Graham Greene&#x27;s novel &quot;The Quiet American&quot; takes place during this war.

In 2011, Vietnamese software developer Emobi Games released a first-person-shooter called &quot;7554&quot;. Named after the date 07-05-54 (7 May 1954) which marks the end of the decisive Battle of Dien Bien Phu, it commemorates the First Indochina War from the Vietnamese point of view.

The 2017 film by Olivier Lorelle, &quot;Ciel Rouge&quot;, starring Cyril Descours and Audrey Giacomini, is set during the early part of the First Indochina War.

<doc id="222937" wikidata="Q3048621" url="?curid=222937" title="List of diseases of the honey bee">
<text>Diseases of the honey bee or abnormal hive conditions include:

== Pests and parasites ==

=== &quot;Varroa&quot; mites ===
&quot;Varroa destructor&quot; and &quot;V. jacobsoni&quot; are parasitic mites that feed on the fat bodies of adult, pupal and larval bees. When the hive is very heavily infested, &quot;Varroa&quot; mites can be seen with the naked eye as a small red or brown spot on the bee&#x27;s thorax. &quot;Varroa&quot; mites are carriers for many viruses that are damaging to bees. For example, bees infected during their development will often have visibly deformed wings.

&quot;Varroa&quot; mites have led to the virtual elimination of feral bee colonies in many areas, and are a major problem for kept bees in apiaries. Some feral populations are now recovering—it appears they have been naturally selected for &quot;Varroa&quot; resistance.

&quot;Varroa&quot; mites were first discovered in Southeast Asia in about 1904, but are now present on all continents, following their introduction to Australia in 2022. They were discovered in the United States in 1987, in the United Kingdom in 1992, and in New Zealand in 2000.

To the untrained eye, these mites are generally not a very noticeable problem for a strongly growing hive- as the bees may appear strong in number, and may even be very effective at foraging. However, the mite reproduction cycle occurs inside the capped pupae, and the mite population can surge as a result of colony growth. Careful observation of a colony can help identify signs of disease often spread by mites. When the hive population growth is reduced in preparation for winter or due to poor late summer forage, the mite population growth can overtake that of the bees and can then destroy the hive. It has been observed diseased colonies may slowly die off and be unable to survive through winter even when adequate food stores are present. Often a colony will simply abscond (leave as in a swarm, but leaving no population behind) under such conditions.

&quot;Varroa&quot; in combination with viral vectors and bacteria have been theoretically implicated in colony collapse disorder.

It is known that thymol, a compound produced by thyme, naturally occurring in thyme honey, is a treatment for &quot;Varroa&quot;, though it may cause bee mortality at high concentrations. Provisioning active colonies with crops of thyme may provide the colony with a non-interventional chemical defense against &quot;Varroa&quot;.

==== Treatment ====
A variety of chemical and mechanical treatments are used to attempt to control &quot;Varroa&quot; mites.

;&quot;Hard&quot; chemicals: 
&quot;Hard&quot; chemical treatments include amitraz (marketed as &quot;Apivar&quot;), fluvalinate (marketed as &quot;Apistan&quot;), coumaphos (marketed as CheckMite), flumethrin (marketed as &quot;Bayvarol&quot; and &quot;Polyvar Yellow&quot;).

;&quot;Soft&quot; chemicals:
&quot;Soft&quot; chemical treatments include thymol (marketed as &quot;ApiLife-VAR&quot; and &quot;Apiguard&quot;), 
sucrose octanoate esters (marketed as &quot;Sucrocide&quot;), 
oxalic acid (marked as &quot;Api-bioxal&quot;) and formic acid (sold in liquid form or in gel strips as Mite Away Quick Strips and Formic Pro, but also used in other formulations).

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, when used in beehives as directed, chemical treatments kill a large proportion of the mites while not substantially disrupting bee behavior or life span. Use of chemical controls is generally regulated and varies from country to country. With few exceptions, they are not intended for use during production of marketable honey.

;&quot;Mechanical&quot; treatments:
Common mechanical controls generally rely on disruption of some aspect of the mites&#x27; lifecycle. These controls are generally intended not to eliminate all mites, but merely to maintain the infestation at a level which the colony can tolerate. Examples of mechanical controls include drone brood sacrifice (&quot;Varroa&quot; mites are preferentially attracted to the drone brood), powdered sugar dusting (which encourages cleaning behavior and dislodges some mites), screened bottom boards (so any dislodged mites fall through the bottom and away from the colony), brood interruption and, perhaps, downsizing of the brood cell size.

=== Acarine (tracheal) mites ===
&quot;Acarapis woodi&quot; is a parasitic mite that infests the trachea that lead from the first pair of thoracic spiracles. An unidentified bee illness was first reported on the Isle of Wight in England in 1904, becoming known as the &#x27;Isle of Wight disease&#x27; (IoWD), which was initially thought to be caused by &quot;Acarapis woodi&quot; when it was identified in 1921 by Rennie. The IoWD disease quickly spread to the rest of Great Britain and Ireland, dealing a devastating blow to British and Irish beekeeping, being claimed as having wiped out the indigenous bee population of the British Isles. In 1991 Bailey and Ball stated &quot;The final opinion of Rennie (1923), a co-discoverer of &quot;Acarapis woodi&quot;, who had much experience with bees said to have the Isle of Wight Disease, was that under the original and now quite properly discarded designation &#x27;Isle of Wight Disease&#x27; were included several maladies having analogous superficial symptoms&quot;, the authors came to the firm conclusion that the IoWD was not caused by acarine (&quot;Acarapis woodi&quot;) mites solely, but primarily by chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV), even though &quot;Acarapis woodi&quot; was always found to be present within the hive whenever CBPV symptoms were observed. Brother Adam at Buckfast Abbey developed a resistant bee breed known as the Buckfast bee, which is now available worldwide.

Diagnosis for tracheal mites generally involves the dissection and microscopic examination of a sample of bees from the hive.

&quot;Acarapis woodi&quot; are believed to have entered the U.S. in 1984, from Mexico.

Mature female acarine mites leave the bee&#x27;s airway and climb out on a hair of the bee, where they wait until they can transfer to a young bee. Once on the new bee, they move into the airways and begin laying eggs.

==== Treatment ====
Acarine mites are commonly controlled with grease patties (typically made from one part vegetable shortening mixed with three to four parts powdered sugar) placed on the top bars of the hive. The bees come to eat the sugar and pick up traces of shortening, which disrupts the mite&#x27;s ability to identify a young bee. Some of the mites waiting to transfer to a new host remain on the original host. Others transfer to a random bee—a proportion of which will die of other causes before the mite can reproduce.

Menthol, either allowed to vaporize from crystal form or mixed into the grease patties, is also often used to treat acarine mites.

===&quot;Nosema&quot; disease ===
&quot;Nosema apis&quot; is a microsporidian that invades the intestinal tracts of adult bees and causes &quot;Nosema&quot; disease, also known as nosemosis. &quot;Nosema&quot; infection is also associated with black queen cell virus. It spreads via fecal to oral matter to infect bees. It is normally only a problem when the bees cannot leave the hive to eliminate waste (for example, during an extended cold spell in winter or when the hives are enclosed in a wintering barn). When the bees are unable to void (cleansing flights), they can develop dysentery.

&quot;Nosema&quot; disease is treated by increasing the ventilation through the hive. Some beekeepers treat hives with agents such as fumagillin.

Nosemosis can also be prevented or minimized by removing much of the honey from the beehive, then feeding the bees on sugar water in the late fall. Sugar water made from refined sugar has lower ash content than flower nectar, reducing the risk of dysentery. Refined sugar, however, contains fewer nutrients than natural honey, which causes some controversy among beekeepers.

In 1996, a similar type of organism to &quot;N. apis&quot; was discovered on the Asian honey bee &quot;Apis cerana&quot; and subsequently named &quot;N. ceranae&quot;. This parasite apparently also infects the western honey bee.

Exposure to corn pollen containing genes for &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; (Bt) production may weaken the bees&#x27; defense against &quot;Nosema&quot;. In relation to feeding a group of bees with Bt corn pollen and a control group with non-Bt corn pollen: &quot;in the first year, the bee colonies happened to be infested with parasites (microsporidia). This infestation led to a reduction in the number of bees and subsequently to reduced broods in the Bt-fed colonies, as well as in the colonies fed on Bt toxin-free pollen. The trial was then discontinued at an early stage. This effect was significantly more marked in the Bt-fed colonies. (The significant differences indicate an interaction of toxin and pathogen on the epithelial cells of the honeybee intestine. The underlying mechanism which causes this effect is unknown.)&quot;

This study should be interpreted with caution given that no repetition of the experiment nor any attempt to find confounding factors was made. In addition, Bt toxin and transgenic Bt pollen showed no acute toxicity to any of the life stages of the bees examined, even when the Bt toxin was fed at concentrations 100 times that found in transgenic Bt pollen from maize.

Nosema disease is very common when bees get into winter clusters, as they spend an extensive time in their hives as they keep together for warmth and have little to no opportunities to eliminate waste.

=== Small hive beetle ===
&quot;Aethina tumida&quot; is a small, dark-colored beetle that lives in beehives. Originally from Africa, the first discovery of small hive beetles in the Western Hemisphere was made in St. Lucie County, Florida, in 1998. The next year, a specimen that had been collected from Charleston, South Carolina, in 1996 was identified, and is believed to be the index case for the United States. By December 1999, small hive beetles were reported in Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin, and it was found in California by 2006.

The lifecycle of this beetle includes pupation in the ground outside of the hive. Controls to prevent ants from climbing into the hive are believed to also be effective against the hive beetle. Several beekeepers are experimenting with the use of diatomaceous earth around the hive as a way to disrupt the beetle&#x27;s lifecycle. The diatoms abrade the insects&#x27; surfaces, causing them to dehydrate and die.

==== Treatment ====

Several pesticides are currently used against the small hive beetle. The chemical fipronil (marketed as Combat Roach Gel) is commonly applied inside the corrugations of a piece of cardboard. Standard corrugations are large enough that a small hive beetle can enter the cardboard through the end, but small enough that honey bees cannot enter (thus are kept away from the pesticide). Alternative controls such as oil-based top-bar traps are also available, but they have had very little commercial success.

=== Wax moths ===
&quot;Galleria mellonella&quot; (greater wax moths) do not attack the bees directly, but feed on the shed exoskeletons of bee larvae and pollen that is found in dark brood comb, which was used by the bees to hold the developing bees. Their full development to adults requires access to used brood comb or brood cell cleanings—these contain protein essential for the larval development, in the form of brood cocoons. The destruction of the comb will spill or contaminate stored honey and may kill bee larvae.

When honey supers are stored for the winter in a mild climate, or in heated storage, the wax moth larvae can destroy portions of the comb, though they will not fully develop. Damaged comb may be scraped out and replaced by the bees. Wax moth larvae and eggs are killed by freezing, so storage in unheated sheds or barns in higher latitudes is the only control necessary.

Because wax moths cannot survive a cold winter, they are usually not a problem for beekeepers in the northern U.S. or Canada, unless they survive winter in heated storage, or are brought from the south by purchase or migration of beekeepers. They thrive and spread most rapidly with temperatures above 30 °C (90 °F), so some areas with only occasional days that are hot rarely have a problem with wax moths, unless the colony is already weak due to stress from other factors.

==== Control and treatment ====
A strong hive generally needs no treatment to control wax moths; the bees themselves kill and clean out the moth larvae and webs. Wax moth larvae may fully develop in cell cleanings when such cleanings accumulate thickly where they are not accessible to the bees.

Wax moth development in comb is generally not a problem with top bar hives, as unused combs are usually left in the hive during the winter. Since this type of hive is not used in severe wintering conditions, the bees are able to patrol and inspect the unused comb.

Wax moths can be controlled in stored comb by application of the aizawai variety of &quot;B. thuringiensis&quot; spores by spraying. It is a very effective biological control and has an excellent safety record.

Wax moths can be controlled chemically with paradichlorobenzene (moth crystals or urinal disks). If chemical methods are used, the combs must be well-aired for several days before use. The use of naphthalene (mothballs) is discouraged because it accumulates in the wax, which can kill bees or contaminate honey stores.

Control of wax moths by other means includes the freezing of the comb for a few hours. 
Langstroth found that placing a spider, such as a daddy-long-legs, with stored combs 
controlled wax moth and eliminate the need for hash chemicals. 
This has been confirmed more recently by others, such as Bergqvist.

=== &quot;Tropilaelaps&quot; ===
&quot;Tropilaelaps mercedesae&quot; and &quot;T. clareae&quot; are considered serious threats to honeybees. Although they are not currently found outside Asia, these mites have the potential to inflict serious damage to colonies due to their rapid reproduction inside the hive.

== Bacterial diseases ==
=== American foulbrood ===

American foulbrood (AFB), caused by the spore-forming &quot;Paenibacillus larvae&quot; (formerly classified as &quot;Bacillus larvae&quot;, then &quot;P. larvae&quot; ssp. &quot;larvae/pulvifaciens&quot;), is the most widespread and destructive of the bee brood diseases. &quot;P. larvae&quot; is a rod-shaped bacterium. Larvae up to three days old become infected by ingesting spores present in their food. Young larvae less than 24 hours old are most susceptible to infection. Spores germinate in the gut of the larva and the vegetative bacteria begin to grow, taking nourishment from the larva. Spores will not germinate in larvae over three days old. Infected larvae normally die after their cell is sealed. The vegetative form of the bacterium will die, but not before it produces many millions of spores. American foulbrood spores are extremely resistant to desiccation and can remain viable for 80 years in honey and beekeeping equipment. Each dead larva may contain as many as 100 million spores. This disease only affects the bee larvae, but is highly infectious and deadly to bee brood. Infected larvae darken and die.

As with European foulbrood, research has been conducted using the &quot;shook swarm&quot; method to control American foulbrood, &quot;the advantage being that chemicals are not used&quot;.

=== European foulbrood ===
European foulbrood (EFB) is caused by the bacterium &quot;Melissococcus plutonius&quot; that infects the midgut of bee larvae. European foulbrood is considered less serious than American foulbrood. &quot;M. plutonius&quot; is not a spore-forming bacterium, but bacterial cells can survive for several months on wax foundation. Symptoms include dead and dying larvae which can appear curled upwards, brown or yellow, melted or deflated with tracheal tubes more apparent, or dried out and rubbery.
method 
Scientific research showed that the spread of the disease is density dependent. The higher the density of apiaries, the higher the probability of disease transmission.

European foulbrood is often considered a &quot;stress&quot; disease—dangerous only if the colony is already under stress for other reasons. An otherwise healthy colony can usually survive European foulbrood.

Chemical treatment with oxytetracycline hydrochloride may control an outbreak of the disease, but honey from treated colonies could have chemical residues from the treatment, and prophylactic treatments are not recommended as they may lead to resistant bacteria.

The &quot;shook swarm&quot; method of bee husbandry can also effectively control the disease, with the advantage of avoiding the use of chemicals.

The Alexander-House-Miller treatment has also been shown to be effective against the disease. The method requires the hive to be strong and the queen to be prevented from laying for a week or so. A modified version of this method is given by Carr in his article. The queen is placed on frames of foundation below a queen excluder, and all of the brood frames are put above the excluder. Once all of the worker brood has emerged, these frames are removed from the hive and the old comb in them replaced with foundation ready for re-use.

== Fungal diseases ==

=== Chalkbrood ===

&quot;Ascosphaera apis&quot; causes a fungal disease that only affects bee brood, but adult bees can be carriers. It infests the gut of the larvae before the cell is sealed or soon after. The fungus competes with them for food, ultimately causing them to starve. The fungus then goes on to consume the rest of the larval bodies, causing them to appear white, hard, and &quot;chalky&quot;. If fungal spores start to develop, the larva can also appear gray or black. One study suggested it could be economically devastating because not only does it weaken the hive, but it can cause honey reductions of 5–37%.

Chalkbrood (ascosphaerosis larvae apium) is most commonly visible during wet springs. Hedtke et al. provided statistical evidence that chalkbrood outbreaks occurred in summer when there was a &quot;N. ceranae&quot; infection earlier in the spring and there is an ongoing &quot;V. destructor&quot; infestation. Stress, genetics of the bees, and health can also be contribute to the presence of chalkbrood.

Spores of the fungus can last for up to 15 years, which is why old equipment from a previously infected hive should not be used. These spores can last in pollen, honey, and wax. Even though Hornitzky&#x27;s literature review of articles on chalkbrood disease concluded that there was no definitive cure or control, there are a variety of prevention mechanisms. Improving genetic stock to be more hygienic, sterilization of old equipment, good ventilation and the replacement of old brood comb are all techniques that can be attempted.

Chalkbrood was first recognized in 1900s in Europe, and then spread to countries such as Argentina, Turkey, Philippines, Mexico, Chile, Central America and Japan. It was first recorded in the United States in the mid-1960s in Utah and spread across the US from there.

=== Stonebrood ===
Stonebrood (aspergillosis larvae apium) is a fungal disease caused by &quot;Aspergillus fumigatus&quot;, &quot;A. flavus&quot;, and &quot;A. niger&quot;. It causes mummification of the brood of a honey bee colony. The fungi are common soil inhabitants and are also pathogenic to other insects, birds, and mammals. The disease is difficult to identify in the early stages of infection. The spores of the different species have different colours and can also cause respiratory damage to humans and other animals. When bee larvae take in spores, they may hatch in the gut, growing rapidly to form a collar-like ring near the larval heads. After death, the larvae turn black and become difficult to crush, hence the name stonebrood. Eventually, the fungus erupts from the integument of the larvae and forms a false skin. In this stage, the larvae are covered with powdery fungal spores. Worker bees clean out the infected brood and the hive may recover depending on factors such as the strength of the colony, the level of infection, and hygienic habits of the strain of bees (variation in the trait occurs among different subspecies).

== Viral diseases ==

===Dicistroviridae===

==== Chronic bee paralysis virus ====
* Syndrome 1 result in abnormal trembling of the wings and body. The bees cannot fly, and often crawl on the ground and up plant stems. In some cases, the crawling bees can be found in large numbers (1000+). The bees huddle together on the top of the cluster or on the top bars of the hive. They may have bloated abdomens due to distension of the honey sac. The wings are partially spread or dislocated.
* Syndrome 2-affected bees are able to fly, but are almost hairless. They appear dark or black and look smaller. They have a relatively broad abdomen. They are often nibbled by older bees in the colony and this may be the cause of the hairlessness. They are hindered at the entrance to the hive by the guard bees. A few days after infection, trembling begins. They then become flightless and soon die.

In 2008, the chronic bee paralysis virus was reported for the first time in &quot;Formica rufa&quot; and another species of ant, &quot;Camponotus vagus&quot;.

====Acute bee paralysis virus====
Acute bee paralysis virus is considered to be a common infective agent of bees. It belongs to the family &quot;Dicistroviridae&quot;, as does the Israel acute paralysis virus, Kashmir bee virus, and the black queen cell virus. It is frequently detected in apparently healthy colonies. This virus seemingly plays a role in cases of sudden collapse of honey bee colonies infested with the parasitic mite &quot;V. destructor&quot;.

====Israeli acute paralysis virus====
Described in 2004 the Israeli acute paralysis virus belongs to the family &quot;Dicistroviridae&quot;, as does the Acute bee paralysis virus. 
The virus is named after the place where it was first identified – its place of origin is unknown. It has been suggested as a marker associated with colony collapse disorder.

====Kashmir bee virus====

Kashmir bee virus is related to the preceding viruses. Discovered in 2004, it is currently only positively identifiable by a laboratory test. Little is known about it yet.

====Black queen cell virus====
Black queen cell virus causes the queen larva to turn black and die. It is thought to be associated with &quot;Nosema&quot;.

====Cloudy wing virus====
Cloudy wing virus is a little-studied, small, icosahedral virus commonly found in honey bees, especially in collapsing colonies infested by &quot;V. destructor&quot;, providing circumstantial evidence that the mite may act as a vector.

====Sacbrood virus====

A picornavirus-like virus causes sacbrood disease. Affected larvae change from pearly white to gray and finally black. Death occurs when the larvae are upright, just before pupation. Consequently, affected larvae are usually found in capped cells. Head development of diseased larvae is typically delayed. The head region is usually darker than the rest of the body and may lean toward the center of the cell. When affected larvae are carefully removed from their cells, they appear to be a sac filled with water. Typically, the scales are brittle but easy to remove. Sacbrood-diseased larvae have no characteristic odor.

===Iflaviridae===
====Deformed wing virus====

Deformed wing virus (DWV) is the causative agent of the wing deformities and other body malformations typically seen in honeybee colonies that are heavily infested with the parasitic mite &quot;V. destructor&quot;. DWV is part of a complex of closely related virus strains/species that also includes Kakugo virus, &quot;V. destructor&quot; virus 1 and Egypt bee virus. This deformity can clearly be seen on the honeybee&#x27;s wings in the image. The deformities are produced almost exclusively due to DWV transmission by &quot;V. destructor&quot; when it parasitizes pupae. Bees infected as adults remain symptom-free, although they do display behavioral changes and have reduced life expectancy. Deformed bees are rapidly expelled from the colony, leading to a gradual loss of adult bees for colony maintenance. If this loss is excessive and can no longer be compensated by the emergence of healthy bees, the colony rapidly dwindles and dies.

====Kakugo virus====
Kakugo virus is an &quot;Iflavirus&quot; infecting bees; varroa mites may mediate its prevalence. Kakugo virus appears to be a subtype of &quot;Deformed wing virus&quot;.

==== Slow bee paralysis virus ====
As the name suggests, &quot;slow bee paralysis virus&quot; induces paralysis to the anterior legs ten to twelve days after infection.

===Iridoviridae===

====Invertebrate iridescent virus type 6 (IIV-6)====

Applying proteomics-based pathogen screening tools in 2010, researchers announced they had identified a co-infection of an Iridovirus; specifically invertebrate iridescent virus type 6 (IIV-6) and &quot;N. ceranae&quot; in all CCD colonies sampled. On the basis of this research, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported the colony collapse mystery solved, quoting researcher Bromenshenk, a co-author of the study, &quot;[The virus and fungus] are both present in all these collapsed colonies.&quot; Evidence for this association, however, remains minimal and several authors have disputed the original methodology used to associate CCD with IIV-6.

===Secoviridae===

====Tobacco ringspot virus====
The RNA virus tobacco ringspot virus, a plant pathogen, was described to infect honeybees through infected pollen, but this unusual claim was soon challenged and remains to be confirmed.

====Lake Sinai virus====
In 2015, Lake Sinai virus (LSV) genomes were assembled and three main domains were discovered: Orf1, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and capsid protein sequences. LSV1, LSV2, LSV3, LSV4, LSV5, and LSV6 were described. LSV were detected in bees, mites and pollen. It only actively replicates in honey bees and mason bees (&quot;Osmia cornuta&quot;) and not in &quot;Varroa&quot; mites.

== Dysentery ==
Dysentery is a condition resulting from a combination of long periods of inability to make cleansing flights (generally due to cold weather) and food stores that contain a high proportion of indigestible matter. As a bee&#x27;s gut becomes engorged with feces that cannot be voided in flight as preferred by the bees, the bee voids within the hive. When enough bees do this, the hive population rapidly collapses and death of the colony results. Dark honeys and honeydews have greater quantities of indigestible matter.

Occasional warm days in winter are critical for honey bee survival; dysentery problems increase in likelihood during periods of more than two or three weeks with temperatures below 50 °F (10 °C). When cleansing flights are few, bees are often forced out at times when the temperature is barely adequate for their wing muscles to function, and large quantities of bees may be seen dead in the snow around the hives. Colonies found dead in spring from dysentery have feces smeared over the frames and other hive parts.

In very cold areas of North America and Europe, where honey bees are kept in ventilated buildings during the coldest part of winter, no cleansing flights are possible; under such circumstances, beekeepers commonly remove all honey from the hives and replace it with sugar water or high-fructose corn syrup, which have nearly no indigestible matter.

== Chilled brood ==
Chilled brood is not actually a disease, but can be a result of mistreatment of the bees by the beekeeper. It also can be caused by a pesticide hit that primarily kills off the adult population, or by a sudden drop in temperature during rapid spring build-up. The brood must be kept warm at all times; nurse bees will cluster over the brood to keep it at the right temperature. When a beekeeper opens the hive (to inspect, remove honey, check the queen, or just to look) and prevents the nurse bees from clustering on the frame for too long, the brood can become chilled, deforming or even killing some of the bees.

== Pesticide losses ==
Honey bees are susceptible to many of the chemicals used for agricultural spraying of other insects and pests. Many pesticides are known to be toxic to bees. Because the bees forage up to several miles from the hive, they may fly into areas actively being sprayed by farmers or they may collect pollen from contaminated flowers.

Carbamate pesticides, such as carbaryl, can be especially pernicious since toxicity can take as long as two days to become evident, allowing infected pollen to be returned and distributed throughout the colony. Organophosphates and other insecticides are also known to kill honey bee clusters in treated areas.

Pesticide losses may be relatively easy to identify (large and sudden numbers of dead bees in front of the hive) or quite difficult, especially if the loss results from a gradual accumulation of pesticide brought in by the foraging bees. Quick-acting pesticides may deprive the hive of its foragers, dropping them in the field before they can return home.

Insecticides that are toxic to bees have label directions that protect the bees from poisoning as they forage. To comply with the label, applicators must know where and when bees forage in the application area, and the length of residual activity of the pesticide.

Some pesticide authorities recommend, and some jurisdictions require, that notice of spraying be sent to all known beekeepers in the area, so they can seal the entrances to their hives and keep the bees inside until the pesticide has had a chance to disperse. This, however, does not solve all problems associated with spraying and the label instructions should be followed regardless of doing this. Sealing honey bees from flight on hot days can kill bees. Beekeeper notification does not offer any protection to bees, if the beekeeper cannot access them, or to wild native or feral honey bees. Thus, beekeeper notification as the sole protection procedure does not really protect all the pollinators of the area, and is, in effect, a circumventing of the label requirements. Pesticide losses are a major factor in pollinator decline.

== Colony collapse disorder ==
Colony collapse disorder (CCD) is a poorly understood phenomenon in which worker bees from a beehive or western honey bee colony abruptly disappear. CCD was originally discovered in Florida by David Hackenberg in western honey bee colonies in late 2006.

European beekeepers observed a similar phenomenon in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, and initial reports have also come in from Switzerland and Germany, albeit to a lesser degree. Possible cases of CCD have also been reported in Taiwan since April 2007.

Initial hypotheses were wildly different, including environmental change-related stresses, malnutrition, pathogens (i.e., disease including Israel acute paralysis virus), mites, or the class of pesticides known as neonicotinoids, which include imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam. Most new research suggests the neonicotinoid hypothesis was incorrect, however, and that pesticides play little role in CCD compared to &quot;Varroa&quot; and &quot;Nosema&quot; infestations. Other theories included radiation from cellular phones or other man-made devices and genetically modified crops with pest-control characteristics. In 2010, U.S. researchers announced they had identified a co-infection of invertebrate iridescent virus type 6 (IIV-6) and &quot;N. ceranae&quot; in all CCD colonies sampled.

<doc id="222939" wikidata="Q1957732" url="?curid=222939" title="McDonnell XF-88 Voodoo">
<text>The McDonnell XF-88 Voodoo was a long-range, twinjet fighter aircraft designed for the United States Air Force. Although it never entered production, its design was adapted for the subsequent supersonic F-101 Voodoo.

==Design and development==
The XF-88 originated from a 1946 United States Army Air Forces requirement for a long-range &quot;penetration fighter&quot; to escort bombers to their targets. It was to be essentially a jet-powered replacement for the wartime North American P-51 Mustang that had escorted Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers over Germany. It was to have a combat radius of 900 mi (1,450 km) and high performance. McDonnell began work on the aircraft, dubbed Model 36, on 1 April 1946. On 20 June the company was given a contract for two prototypes designated XP-88. Dave Lewis was Chief of Aerodynamics on this project.

The initial design was intended to have straight wings and a V-shaped tail, but wind tunnel tests indicated aerodynamic problems that led to a conventional tailplane being substituted and the wings being swept. The USAAF confirmed the order for the two prototypes on 14 February 1947, while a change in designation schemes led to the unflown prototypes being re-designated XF-88 on 1 July 1948, with the type gaining the nickname &quot;Voodoo&quot;.

The Voodoo had a low/mid-mounted wing, swept to 35°. The two engines, specified as Westinghouse J34 turbojets were in the lower fuselage, fed by air intakes in the wing roots and jetpipes beneath the rear fuselage. This made room in the long fuselage for the fuel tanks required for the required long range. The Voodoo&#x27;s short nose had no radar, being intended to house an armament of six 20 mm (.79 in) M39 cannon, while the fighter&#x27;s single pilot sat in a pressurized cockpit and was provided with an ejection seat.

==Operational history==
The first XF-88 made its maiden flight from Muroc Field on 20 October 1948, piloted by McDonnell Chief Test Pilot Robert Edholm. It was unarmed and powered by non-afterburning J34-13 engines that gave 3,000 lbf (13.37 kN) thrust. While testing demonstrated adequate handling and the required endurance, the XF-88 proved to be underpowered. This resulted in inadequate performance, with its maximum speed of 641 mph being less than the F-86A then in production. In order to improve performance, it was decided to fit the second prototype&#x27;s engines with McDonnell-designed afterburners. Thus modified, the engines became J34-22s, giving 3,600 lbf (16.05 kN) thrust. The second prototype, XF-88A, made its maiden flight on 26 April 1949, with the first prototype later modified to the same standard.

The afterburners improved the Voodoo&#x27;s performance, with the XF-88A reaching 700 mph (1,126 km/h) but at the expense of decreased range owing to increased fuel consumption. Despite this, the XF-88 was chosen against the Lockheed XF-90 and North American YF-93 for the USAF&#x27;s Penetration Fighter requirement, with planned production versions to use more powerful Westinghouse J46 engines. (A 1948 order for 118 F-93s had been cancelled in 1949.) Changes in Air Force priorities, together with a shortage of money, led the penetration fighter to be cancelled in August 1950.

The first prototype was modified to XF-88B standard as a propeller-research vehicle. The model propeller was driven by a nose-mounted Allison T38 turboprop which was used to assist in the climb as well as to reach the test conditions. The aircraft was used to test three propellers through 1956, to speeds slightly exceeding Mach 1.0, the first propeller-equipped aircraft to do so. The propeller was tested in level flight to about M 0.9 with the help of the turbojet afterburners, and to just over M 1.0 in a dive.

McDonnell also proposed a naval version of the XF-88, a two-seat operational trainer, and a reconnaissance variant but none were built. Both prototypes were scrapped by 1958.

Experience of the Korean War led the USAF to reconsider its plans for penetration fighters and led to a new specification for a long-range fighter, General Operational Requirement (GOR) 101 being issued in February 1951. A considerably enlarged version of the design was chosen to meet this requirement later that year, the revised design becoming the F-101 Voodoo, the first production version of which flew on 29 September 1954.

<doc id="222940" wikidata="Q194153" url="?curid=222940" title="Common planigale">
<text>The common planigale (Planigale maculata), also known as the pygmy planigale or coastal planigale, is one of the small carnivorous marsupials known as &quot;marsupial mice&quot; found in Australia. There they fill a similar niche to the insectivores of other parts of the world.

The common planigale was first described by John Gould in 1851, using a specimen forwarded to England by the collector Frederick Strange. It was originally described as &quot;Antechinus maculatus&quot;, and it was retained in the genus &quot;Antechinus&quot; until Mike Archer transferred it to &quot;Planigale&quot; in his 1976 revision of the latter genus. The species&#x27; scientific name means &quot;spotted flat-weasel&quot;. 

Two subspecies are recognised:
*&quot;P. m. maculata&quot;, found on mainland Australia;
*&quot;P. m. sinualis&quot;, found on Groote Eylandt.

==Physical description==
As a &quot;marsupial mouse,&quot; the common planigale lies somewhere between a mouse and a shrew in shape. Its body is covered in fur, though that of the tail is sparse when compared to the rest of the body. The underside of its coat is a light grayish yellow color, while the rest varies by individual from gray to a cinnamon color. This species is the largest of the genus, with a body and head length of about and a tail length of about . Typical weights are close to for males and close to for females. The head of the common planigale is very narrow, giving it a flattened appearance, though less so than other planigales. Females have a well-developed pouch that opens toward the rear.

==Reproduction==
The gestation for common planigale is 20 days. At the end of that period, the female gives birth to 5-11 young; the number varies but tends to be consistent with the number of teats the female possesses. They are born at an early stage in development and migrate to the pouch, where they suckle until they are fully developed. Young fully emerge from the pouch around 28 days of age, begin eating solid food at around 55, and are independent of the mother at 70. Breeding begins at around 290 days, later than many similar species. Males continue breeding until at least 24 months of age. Females are polyestrous and can raise several litters a year; in captivity, breeding takes place year-round.

==Behaviour==
The common planigale makes its living on the ground where thick cover is present to protect it from predators. Its flattened skull allows it to slip through narrow crevasses, holes, and stands of grass to escape quickly or hunt for its prey. Community nests are often built. In captivity, females make small, saucer-shaped nests out of bark and grass; it is assumed that they do the same in the wild. The species is primarily nocturnal, though in the winter it will come out to forage for food in the daylight if conditions are favourable. If conditions are unfavourable, individuals may enter a state of torpor. In this state, metabolism is suppressed, decreasing oxygen use and lowering the respiration rate from 100/min to 15-30/min. Most species only enter torpor when food is scarce, but the common planigale has been observed to do so even when food is abundant, so air temperature may be the primary factor. While in this state, individuals curl up on their sides and tuck their heads into their stomach.

==Diet==
The common planigale, like other members of the genus &quot;Planigale&quot;, eats primarily insects and other arthropods, though they may occasionally prey on other small animals, such as lizards or birds. Due to its small size, the common planigale tends to prefer smaller insects, typically those that are less than in length. However, it is capable of taking larger prey, such as large beetles and especially grasshoppers. To kill an insect, it bites the prey&#x27;s underside, where the exoskeleton is softer. In captivity, the species is known to eat mealworms, commercial dog food, eggs, honey, and minced meat.

==Distribution and habitat==
The common planigale is found from the upper Hunter River valley not far north of Sydney along the coast and hinterland to Cape York, and across the Top End of Australia to the Kimberley and a little beyond. It is also found on Groote Eylandt and on Great Keppel Island where its survival is threatened by proposed development. It occupies a wider range of habitat than other planigales, living in sclerophyll forest, rainforest, marshlands, grasslands and even the outer suburbs of Brisbane where it is occasionally trapped mistakenly as a house mouse. Throughout these habitats, it prefers areas with thick cover near water.

==Conservation status==
The exact population of the common planigale is not known, but the species is not believed to be threatened and is not listed as such.

<text>The BMP-1 is a Soviet amphibious tracked infantry fighting vehicle that has been in service from 1966 to the present. BMP stands for &quot;Boyevaya Mashina Pyekhoty 1&quot; (), meaning &quot;infantry fighting vehicle, 1st serial model&quot;. The BMP-1 was the first mass-produced infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) of the Soviet Union. It was called the M-1967, BMP and BMP-76PB by NATO before its correct designation was known.

The Soviet military leadership saw any future wars as being conducted with nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. A new design, like the BMP, combining the properties of an armoured personnel carrier (APC) and a light tank would allow infantry to operate from the relative safety of its armoured, radiation-shielded interior in contaminated areas and to fight alongside it in uncontaminated areas. It would increase infantry squad mobility, provide fire support to them, and also be able to fight alongside main battle tanks.

The BMP-1 was first tested in combat in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, where it was used by Egyptian and Syrian forces. Based on lessons learned from this conflict, and early experiences in the Soviet–Afghan War, a version with improved fighting qualities was developed, the BMP-2. It was accepted into service in August 1980.

In 1987, the BMP-3, a radically redesigned vehicle with a completely new weapon, entered service in limited numbers with the Soviet Army.

== Development ==

The Red Army&#x27;s mechanized infantry tactics during the 1950s were similar to World War II methods, in which APCs were used as &quot;battle taxis&quot;. They would keep the infantry in close proximity to the battle tanks during movement, but on enemy contact they would unload their infantry before retreating to safer areas. This was in contrast to the German doctrine of infantry fighting vehicles manifested in the Schützenpanzer Lang HS.30, where the vehicles were supposed to stay with the tanks and engage lighter targets, both to take a burden off the tanks and to support their infantry squads.

Existing APCs offered little or no protection from either nuclear or chemical weapons, as they were either open-topped or could not be sealed sufficiently. Furthermore, the infantry had to disembark to be able to use their weapons.

The requirement for the BMP, which was first drawn up in the late 1950s, stressed speed, good armament, and the ability for all squad members to shoot from within the vehicle. The armament had to provide direct support for dismounted infantry in the attack and defense, and to be able to destroy comparable light armored vehicles. The vehicle needed to protect the crew from .50 cal machinegun fire and 20–23 mm caliber autocannons across the frontal arc, as well as from light shell fragments at distances between 500 m and 800 m.

Firepower consisted of the innovative combination of the 73 mm 2A28 Grom gun and a launcher for the 9M14 Malyutka (AT-3A Sagger A) anti-tank wire-guided missile (ATGM). The gun was intended to engage enemy armored vehicles and firing points at a range of up to . The missile launcher was intended to be used against targets that were to away.

Requirements were issued to the various design bureaus between 1959 and 1960. There was a question as to whether the BMP should be tracked or wheeled, so a number of experimental configurations were explored, including hybrid wheeled/tracked designs.

The tracked Ob&#x27;yekt 764 (codename Object 764) was chosen because its front-engine design provided a convenient and fast way of mounting and dismounting through two rear doors. The original prototype was built in 1964, followed by the improved Ob&#x27;yekt 765 in 1965, which was accepted by the Army in 1966, under a designation BMP-1. The 120th Guards Motor Rifle Division was the first formation in the Soviet Union to test prototypes of the new BMP (&quot;objekt 765&quot;) infantry fighting vehicle in January–November 1965, under the command of Guards Major Vasiliy Samodelov. Small-scale production began in 1966.

=== Table of models ===
== Production history ==
The BMP went into production with the Soviet Army in 1966. The first series (Ob&#x27;yekt 765 Sp1, &quot;specification 1&quot;) was produced until 1969. It was replaced by the improved production model, the BMP-1 (the Ob&#x27;yekt 765 Sp2), which was produced from 1969 until 1973. This, in turn, was replaced by the Ob&#x27;yekt 765 Sp3, which was a modernized, 200 kg heavier version that was produced from 1973 to 1979. A number of improvements were made to the reliability of the chassis, engine and transmission during mass production.

The latest version of the BMP-1 IFV (BMP-1P, Ob&#x27;yekt 765 Sp4), which was produced from 1979 to 1983, was armed with a more powerful ATGM launcher 9P135M-1 for the ATGM &quot;Konkurs&quot;/&quot;Fagot&quot;. The main manufacturer of the BMP-1 and its different variants was the Kurgan Machine Building Works (Kurganskiy Mashinostroitelyniy Zavod) in Russia. The PRP-3 artillery reconnaissance vehicles were produced by the Chelyabinsk Tractor Works (ChTZ). The PRP-4/PRP-4M artillery reconnaissance vehicles were produced by the Rubtsovsk Engineering Works (RMZ). Upgrades of the BMP-1 were performed by KMZ as well as by tank repair workshops of the Ministry of Defence during scheduled and major overhauls. More than 20,000 BMP-1&quot;s&quot; and vehicles based on it were built in the USSR.
BMP-1&quot;s&quot; were produced under license by Czechoslovakia (BVP-1), Romania (MLI-84) and India. Since 1986, the People&#x27;s Republic of China has produced its own unlicensed copy called the Type 86 (WZ 501). The number of Type 86 IFVs and vehicles based upon it is around 3,000. It is still in service with the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. From 1997, Iran produced its own modification of the BMP-1, the Boragh, which resembles the Chinese WZ 503.
=== Variants and modernization ===
In the mid-1970s, after analysis of the use of light AFVs during the Yom Kippur, Angolan and Vietnam wars, a modernization program was begun that resulted in the BMP-1P (Ob&#x27;yekt 765 Sp4). The main changes were the replacement of the largely ineffective 9M14M &quot;Malyutka&quot; ATGM with the more reliable, longer range and more powerful 9P135M or 9P135M-1 ATGM launcher. It was located on a special pintle mount on top of the turret roof, that could fire the SACLOS guided 9M113 and 9M113M &quot;Konkurs-M&quot; ATGMs, which increased armor penetration to and had an extended range of .

The 9P135M-1 launcher was capable of firing 9M111 and 9M111-2 &quot;Fagot&quot; ATGMs. The &quot;Malyutka&quot; loading hatch was usually welded shut and the mounting bracket was removed. The new missiles were somewhat difficult to use since the gunner had to stand in his open hatch, exposing himself to hostile fire. It is possible to detach the 9P135M(1) ATGM launcher from the turret and use it from the ground.

The BMP-1P was equipped with neutron weapon protection covering and a new fire-extinguishing system for protection against napalm. Later BMP-1Ps were fitted with an array of six 902V &quot;Tucha&quot; calibre smoke grenade launchers at the rear of the turret. Some were equipped with the track-width KMT-10 mine plow. The BMP-1P replaced the BMP-1 in production in 1979. Many BMP-1s were upgraded to the new standard during the 1980s.

The BMP-1PG model added a AGS-17 &quot;Plamya&quot; automatic grenade launcher on top of the turret on the left side, for which it carries 290 grenades. Some BMP-1s had the AGS-17 added during major repairs (Ob&#x27;yekt 765Sp8).

A non-amphibious BMP-1D (the so-called &#x27;Afghan&#x27; variant), was built in 1982 for assault units in Afghanistan. It had 5 mm thick appliqué steel armor plates on the hull sides with holes for side firing ports as well as armor plate under the commander&#x27;s and driver&#x27;s seats for added protection against mines. It had large steel armored skirts fitted to the sides of the hull covering the suspension. Firing ports were added into the top hatches of the troop compartment and a stowage box was placed on the roof at the rear of the hull on some vehicles. The 9S428 ATGM launcher was often removed and replaced by an AGS-17 automatic grenade launcher.

Due to experience in Afghanistan, a new version with enhanced fighting capabilities, the BMP-2, was introduced in 1980. It had a new two-man turret armed with a 30 mm 2A42 multi-purpose autocannon and a 9P135M-1 ATGM launcher capable of firing SACLOS guided 9M113 &quot;Konkurs&quot; and 9M113M &quot;Konkurs-M&quot; as well as 9M111 and 9M111-2 &quot;Fagot&quot; ATGMs.

Later modernization plans included mounting the turret of the BMD-2 IFV on to BMP-1s, but the vehicle never left the design phase. Recent proposals for the modernization of BMP-1s include mounting new turrets armed with a 2A72 autocannon, approved in 2018, or a TKB-799 &quot;Kliver&quot; one-man weapons station with a computerized fire control system, armed with a missile pod (which can be armed with either four 9M133 &quot;Kornet&quot; (AT-14 Spriggan) or 9M133F &quot;Kornet&quot; ATGMs or 9K38 &quot;Igla&quot; (SA-18 Grouse) SAMs), a 30 mm 2A72 dual-purpose autocannon and a PKTM coaxial machine gun (BMP-1AM &#x27;Basurmanin&#x27; and BMP-1M respectively).

The BMP-1AM Basurmanin is an upgraded version of BMP-1 developed by The Uralvagonzavod (UVZ) research-and-manufacturing corporation (a subsidiary of the Rostec state corporation). The BMP-1AM is BMP-1 with the original turret replaced by the turret from BTR-82A with a 2A72 30 mm autocannon, a Kalashnikov PKTM 7.62 mm medium machinegun, and 902V Tucha smoke grenade launchers. The turret will be fitted with the TKN-4GA combined day-night sighting system. The 2A72 cannon will be able to use air burst munitions. Approved in 2018, it is the most recent Russian BMP-1 upgrade. The Russian army plans to upgrade all of their BMP-1s and BMP-1Ps to BMP-1AM level.

See BMP-1 variants article for a complete list of BMP-1 modifications and variants based upon it.

== Description ==
The BMP-1 is a fully amphibious tracked vehicle, with a front-engined chassis developed especially for it, a welded steel hull with a sharp, sloping front with a conspicuously ridged surface, a centrally located, flat, truncated cone turret and a troop compartment at the rear.

=== Driver&#x27;s station ===

The driver sits in the front on the left side of the hull. He has three TNPO-170 periscope vision-blocks to provide vision when his hatch is closed. The driver&#x27;s center vision block can be replaced with a TVNO-2 active night binocular vision device for use in night and poor visibility conditions or with a TNPO-350B extended periscope when swimming with the trim vane erected. The BMP was the first Soviet armored vehicle to use a simple yoke steering system.

=== Commander&#x27;s station ===
The commander&#x27;s station is located behind the driver&#x27;s station and is provided with a removable OU-3GA2 or OU-3GK infrared searchlight with an effective range of about . A dual mode (day/night) TKN-3B 5x/4.2x magnification binocular vision device is coupled to the infrared searchlight. Two periscope vision blocks are fitted with a heating and cleaning system. The commander&#x27;s station is equipped with an R-123M radio set.

=== Turret ===
The BMP-1 has a conical turret equipped with a fume extraction system and an electric traverse drive with a manual backup system. The main gun has a dead-zone over the commander&#x27;s hatch (between the 10:00 and 11:00 o&#x27;clock positions), where the gun must be elevated over the infra-red searchlight to avoid crushing it. When the gun is facing backwards, it prevents hatches on top of the troop compartment from opening. The low profile of the turret makes it a difficult target. The same turret is used in the BMD-1.

==== Gunner&#x27;s station ====
The gunner&#x27;s station is located to the left of the main gun. The gunner has a dual mode (day/night) 1PN22M1 6x/6.7x magnification image intensifying monocular periscope sight, four day-use periscope vision blocks, and an OU-3GK removable infrared or white-light searchlight. The 1PN22M1 sight has a maximum range of at night, with the use of the infra-red searchlight. The sight is marked stadiametricly with the apparent size of a tall tank at various ranges.

The original sight was replaced with the 1PN22M2, which has an additional scale for the OG-15V HE-Frag rounds used by the Ob&#x27;yekt 765Sp3, produced from July 1974. The new sight has two day scales for the two projectiles – one from and the other from .

==== Armament ====
;Gun


The main armament is the 73 mm 2A28 &quot;Grom&quot; low pressure smoothbore semi-automatic gun. It is fed from a 40-round magazine located around the turret ring. The cyclic rate of fire is 8 to 10 rounds per minute. The gun returns to an elevation of +3° 30&#x27; to reload after each shot if the autoloader is used. The gun can be reloaded by hand if necessary. Some units removed the autoloader altogether when new vehicles were delivered, but the mechanized ammunition conveyor magazine was kept. High-explosive ammunition, introduced in 1974, can only be loaded manually, from a conveyor.

The 2A28 &#x27;Grom&#x27; smoothbore gun fires the same PG-15V projectiles as the SPG-9 infantry light recoilless gun, but with a smaller propellant charge. The PG-15V HEAT warhead can penetrate of steel armor – more than enough to penetrate the frontal armor of NATO MBTs of the 1970s, such as the US M60A1, the British Chieftain or the German Leopard 1. The modernized PG-9 shell is able to penetrate up to of steel armor. Under battlefield conditions, it has a maximum effective range of .

The disadvantage of the BMP-1 is the small elevation angle of the gun (only 15 degrees).

OG-15V high explosive ammunition was made available from 1974. The warhead has twice the weight of explosives as the anti-armor PG-15V. It is intended for use against troops or soft targets.

A coaxial 7.62 mm PKT machine gun is mounted to the right of the main armament for which the BMP-1 carries 2,000 rounds.

The 2A28 &#x27;Grom&#x27; gun and PKT coaxial machine gun cannot be accurately fired while the vehicle is on the move over rough ground as the turret is unstabilised.

;Missile
Mounted on the gun mantlet, the ATGM launcher is capable of firing the 9M14 &quot;Malyutka&quot;, (NATO: AT-3A Sagger A), the 9M14M &quot;Malyutka-M&quot; (NATO: AT-3B Sagger B) and the 9M14P &quot;Malyutka-P&quot; (NATO: AT-3C Sagger C). All are intended to be used against enemy MBTs and other AFVs at distances from . These ATGMs can penetrate up to of steel armor (NATO standard at the time). The 9M14P missile can be used in manual mode only, like older missiles, without the advantage of semi-automatic guidance.

The BMP-1 carries four ATGMs with their launching rails as a standard (two inside the turret and two inside the hull). In theory, a fifth missile can be carried on the launcher. The missiles are loaded onto a rail launcher through a small rectangular hatch in a turret&#x27;s roof behind the launcher. Each 9M14M weighs , a 9M14P is . These missiles can only be fired in daylight because of the lack of a night sight. A guidance device used in the BMP-1 has the code 9S428.

Besides possessing such advantages as interference immunity and simple control equipment, wire-guided ATGMs are also hampered by significant disadvantages such as a relatively low flight speed, response delay, the inability to load a new missile until the previous one has reached its target and a very long minimum range (). Successful operation of the ATGM while the vehicle is on the move requires a very skilled gunner.

Those BMP-1s still in Russian service that were not modernized to the BMP-1P standard, can now use 9M14-2 &quot;Malyutka-2&quot; (NATO: AT-3D Sagger D) ATGMs (developed in 1995), which have either a tandem shaped-charge or high-explosive thermobaric warhead.

The BMP-1 was a threat to NATO APCs, light AFVs, and even MBTs of its time, by use of its main gun or ATGM. Nevertheless, the strong anti-tank focus of its armament didn&#x27;t provide sufficient firepower against enemy unarmored vehicles, infantry and light fortified positions, especially during mountain battles (mostly due to the low elevation angle of the main gun). The appearance of the more successful BMP-2 armed with the 30mm 2A42 dual-purpose autocannon solved this serious problem.

=== Troop compartment ===
The troop compartment located at the rear of the vehicle can carry up to eight soldiers. There are four firing ports on each side of the vehicle and a single firing port in the left rear door. A combination fume extractor hose and cartridge deflector is provided to clip on to weapons at each station.
Soldiers sit on two padded benches along the center line of the vehicle and face the sides. Vehicle batteries, electric equipment and the main fuel tank are located between the benches, with tool stowage beneath. There are four large D-shaped hatches in the roof of the hull, which can be opened from the troop compartment. The airtight rear doors of the troop compartment contain fuel tanks.

Space inside the troop compartment is limited. There is little room for personal equipment, which leads to it being stowed outside while on operation, sometimes limiting rearward traverse of the turret. The seating is cramped, especially for troops in full battle dress.

In the BMP-1 and BMP-2, ammunition is stored near or even inside the compartment, which can lead to a catastrophic failure in case of a hull breach.

=== Maneuverability ===
The 300 horsepower (224 kW) UTD-20 six-cylinder four-stroke diesel engine is located in the centre of the front hull, behind the transmission, with the cooling system to the right and radiator above. The engine drives a manual gearbox with five forward and one reverse gear. The steering system considerably reduces driver fatigue, especially when compared to the usual lever systems to control the tracks in the older tracked AFVs. The BMP is very fast and maneuverable, even if the long, pointed nose can give some problems when crossing large trenches. The fuel tanks have a maximum capacity of . The diesel engine is of a multifuel design and can use DL (summer) or DZ (winter). It can also use TS-1 kerosene.

The BMP-1 has a maximum road speed of , which is automatically reduced to around off-road.

The BMP-1 can climb high vertical obstacles, and cross a wide trench. It can be driven on 25° side slopes and can climb 35° slopes.

The drive sprockets are at the front with six road wheels, using torsion bar suspension. The BMP-1 has a ground pressure of 0.6 kg/cm2 (8.5 psi) and is able to cross snow-covered and boggy terrain. It has the range, off-road speed and cross-country ability necessary to keep up with fast-moving MBTs.

==== Amphibious capability ====

The BMP-1 is amphibious, propelling itself in the water using its tracks, assisted by hydrodynamic fairings on the track upper side covers. The top swimming speed is . The shape of the hull and some features (hollow road wheels and road wheel arms with air chambers) aid flotation. The BMP-1 can overcome water barriers with a current of up to and waves up to high. More challenging conditions require engineer support.

Before entering the water, the trim vane at the front of the hull should be erected to prevent water from flooding over the bow. While in its travelling position, it serves as additional frontal armor. The rear doors of the troop compartment must be closed tightly before entering the water. Before entering the water, either a full crew of eight troopers or an equivalent ballast must be present in the rear of the vehicle, otherwise vehicle balance is upset and it could sink, as it&#x27;s naturally front heavy.

The BMP-1 can cross water obstacles such as rivers and lakes but it is not intended for sea landing operations.

=== Armor protection ===
The vehicle&#x27;s armor is welded rolled steel, varying in thickness between thick on the top of the hull and on the mantlet of the main gun. The original requirements called for protection against 23 mm armor-piercing rounds across the frontal arc fired from and for protection against 7.62 mm armor-piercing rounds across the side and rear arcs from .

The BMP-1&#x27;s steeply sloped frontal armor can withstand artillery shell fragments, small arms fire and existing .50 caliber (12.7 mm) heavy machine gun AP and API rounds over 60° of the frontal arc from all distances. The very high angle of the hull frontal armor increases the probability of ricochets, and the trim vane in the traveling position adds little additional protection. On most examples, the front armor is immune to 20 millimeter Oerlikon KAD or HS820 auto-cannon fire from ranges greater than 100 meters, but armor quality varies quite significantly with the nationality of a factory.

The side, rear and top armor protect the BMP-1 from 7.62 mm small arms fire from most distances as well as smaller artillery shell fragments, but do not protect the vehicle against 12.7 mm heavy machine gun fire from close distances or larger artillery shell fragments. Ground tests demonstrated that rear doors with their fuel tanks filled with sand withstood hits from standard 12.7 mm rounds. In Afghanistan and Chechnya, armor-piercing 7.62 mm rounds fired from general-purpose machine guns at ranges of around 30–50 m sometimes penetrated the rear doors and hatches.

During the First Persian Gulf War, the armor protection of the BMP-1 proved vulnerable to the armor-piercing rounds of the US M2/M3 Bradley&#x27;s M242 Bushmaster autocannon. During the intense fighting in Chechnya, no penetration of the BMP-1/BMD-1 turret front armor were noticed because the turret made for a small target and had relatively thick frontal armor compared to other parts of the vehicle.

==== Protection issues ====

The BMP-1 had significant shortcomings in its protection scheme, which only became obvious during the Soviet–Afghan War. It seats its driver and commander in a tandem layout, on the left side of the hull front, alongside the diesel engine. When an antitank mine hits the BMP-1s left track, the explosion usually destroyed one to three left side roadwheels, penetrated the bottom, and killed or seriously wounded both the driver and the commander, which caused painful losses of specialist personnel in the Soviet Army. Drivers laid sandbags on the bottom of their compartment in an effort to protect themselves against possible mine attack. The same kind of explosion under the right track was much less dramatic for the driver and the commander, who remained relatively safe.

The experience of Yom Kippur War and Soviet–Afghan War showed that the armored hull of the BMP-1 cannot withstand hits of 12.7-mm bullets on the sides, and the hit of an anti-tank rocket-propelled grenade (RPG), as a rule, caused the vehicle to ignite, followed by an explosion of ammunition.

If the vehicle hit a tilt-rod antitank mine, its steeply sloped lower front glacis plate allowed the mine&#x27;s arming rod to tilt with little resistance until the mine was well under the chassis. When it eventually detonated, the blast was usually sufficient to kill or badly wound the driver and the commander. From 1982, the Soviet 40th Army in Afghanistan began to receive improved BMP-1Ds (the so-called &quot;Afghan&quot; variant), which, among other improvements, included an additional armored plate under the driver&#x27;s and commander&#x27;s stations. This situation was addressed in the later BMP-2 design, where the commander shares the two-man turret with the gunner. The driver&#x27;s and engine compartments could be equipped with additional bottom armor for improved protection against landmines filled with up to of explosives.

There is a protection issue concerning the reloading of the 9M14 &quot;Malyutka&quot; and 9M14M &quot;Malyutka-M&quot; ATGMs in NBC conditions, because doing it through the small hatch from inside the vehicle would negate whatever protection the fighting compartment&#x27;s NBC protection suite gave.

The compactness and low silhouette of the vehicle are generally advantages on a battlefield. Critical areas, such as the engine compartment, the ammunition storage area, fuel cells and the troop compartment, are located in a manner that became the standard for many IFVs and APCs. Penetration anywhere in these areas will often result in mobility and/or firepower damage and/or disabling of the personnel.

The BMP-1 and BMP-2 series vehicles share a major drawback with many Soviet tanks. Ammunition is stored near or even inside the fighting compartment, which makes them more vulnerable to a hit from an anti-tank round or a missile across the side arc. If that happens, the ammunition often explodes, killing everyone and completely destroying the vehicle. During the fighting in Afghanistan and Chechnya, hits by RPGs penetrated the BMP-1&#x27;s armor in 95% of cases. This often resulted in the vehicle burning until the ammunition exploded. Due to these limitations, Soviet/Russian soldiers customarily rode on the outside of the BMP-1, sitting on top of the hull while in combat zones.

The armor of BMP-1 IFVs is insufficient to deal with AP cannon rounds – sufficiently thick armor would increase the weight of the BMP-1 considerably and jeopardize its amphibious ability. Some military analysts support the idea of returning to the concept of open-topped APCs, as the armor of light AFVs cannot protect the crew from anti-tank weapons. Modern APCs are mostly used in local conflicts instead of hypothetical large-scale wars with NBC weapons.


A problem most often cited by western analysts is the design of the main fuel tank. Due to the low profile of the vehicle, the designers have had to place the fuel tank between the two rows of outward-facing seats, meaning that the infantrymen sit very close to the bulk of the vehicle&#x27;s fuel storage. Extra fuel is carried in the hollow armored rear doors. Therefore, a hit by an armor-piercing incendiary round would set the fuel contained there on fire, especially if the fuel is kerosene instead of diesel. The burning fuel would move into the crew compartment, resulting in the death or injury of the infantrymen (if they are unable to leave the vehicle via the roof hatches), and a possible explosion.

However, the rear door tanks are almost always empty when the BMP goes into combat, as they are only meant to increase the road travel range of the vehicle. In intense war areas where the BMP sees action often, and it is relatively near its base of operations, instructions highly recommend detaching the rear door tanks from the fuel system, filling them with sand as additional protection for the troop compartment, and adding fuel to the internal main fuel tank from other sources when the need arises.

This was not practiced by some BMP-1s crews during a number of local conflicts, e.g., in Chechnya, which resulted in frequent attempts by the enemy to hit the rear doors of the BMP-1s. The inner fuel tank is more vulnerable than that of many modern IFVs – the thin side armor means that penetration is likely to occur to the inner fuel tank as well.

The BMP-1 has no air conditioning or air cooling system. Its crew members and passengers suffer heavily in hot climates as its air filtration system and exhaust-ventilation fans cannot provide any comfort at high temperatures. During the Yom Kippur War, crews kept some of the roof hatches open. This meant that they were vulnerable to machine gun fire from higher ground. Only a few examples of the BMP-1 were intended for export – mainly to countries with a hot climate (for example, the Slovak-Belarusian &quot;Cobra-S&quot;). They are equipped with an air conditioning system. The cooling system for the engine is improved, as is the additional forced air cooling system of the engine compartment and radiator. The exhaust system helps to eject gases together with hot air from the engine compartment through the grille located on the right side of the hull roof in front of the turret.

=== Equipment ===
The BMP-1 can make its own smoke screen by injecting vaporized diesel fuel into the exhaust manifold using the TDA engine thermal smoke generating system. Later models have an array of 902V Tucha smoke grenade launchers which can form a screen wide, in front of the vehicle.

A number of BMP-1s were fitted with mountings for the KMT-10 plow-type mine-clearing system in the early 1980s. It is installed on the front of the hull in line with the tracks. The plow weighs and can be attached in 30 minutes. Emergency detaching takes around 10 minutes. The KMT-10 is intended for clearing anti-tank mines under different ground conditions.

It is pneumatically driven and takes four seconds to switch from the traveling position to the digging position. The mine-clearing plows are very narrow, with just two digging tines, each wide, (the same as each track), which limits them to clearing surface-laid mines, in particular scatterable anti-tank mines. A chain mounted between the plows can detonate tilt-rod mines. The maximum mine-clearing speed is .

When the NBC protection system is configured and operating, the crew and passengers are protected from chemical weapons, biological agents and nuclear fallout by an air filtration and overpressure system, which consists of the NBC filter element and the blower/dust separator.

BMP-1s were equipped with one RPG-7/RPG-7V shoulder-launched anti-tank RPG and five PG-7 rounds or one 9K32 Strela-2/9K38 Igla man-portable anti-aircraft missile launcher and two replacement missiles. It carries 1600 rounds for two PK general-purpose machine guns.

== Service history ==

Currently, the major BMP-1 operators, each with over a thousand vehicles in active service, are Russia, India, Poland, and the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

=== Soviet Union and Russia ===
The BMP-1 entered service with the Soviet Army in 1966. The BMP-1 was first seen by Westerners during the 7 November 1967 military parade in Moscow. Its appearance created a stir in the West, where lightly armed APCs were still the norm for transportation and infantry support on the battlefield.

In the Soviet Army, BMP-1s were typically issued to motorized rifle divisions and the motorized rifle regiments of tank divisions, where they replaced the BTR-152, BTR-50P and some BTR-60P APCs.

Currently, BMP-1s and vehicles based upon it are used by the Russian Army and internal security troops of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD).

==== Afghanistan ====

BMP-1s were widely used in the Soviet-Afghan war by motorized rifle and tank units, as well as by Afghan Army units loyal to the PDPA during the Saur Revolution. They were also operated by some special forces. In 1982, as a result of combat experience, a version with applique armor was introduced, called BMP-1D (D=&#x27;desantnaya&#x27;=paratroopers). That version did not have amphibious capability (not critical in the Afghan environment). Many field modifications were made to their BMP-1s by various units. In May 2023, the Taliban used BMP-1s against Iranian border guards.

==== Syria ====
The BMP-1 has seen wide use by all factions fighting in the Syrian Civil War due to large numbers being in stock.

Since 2017 the Hay&#x27;at Tahrir al-Sham have been using captured BMP-1s as vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices in suicide attacks. The vehicle&#x27;s advantages in this role are the large amount of explosives it can carry, the off-road capability afforded by tracks and the armour that both protects the driver from fire and amplifies the effect of the explosion.

==== Russo-Ukrainian War ====
The BMP-1 is still currently being used in the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine by both Russian and Ukrainian forces due to its wide availability compared to the much more modern but less produced BMP-3. As of February 6, 2025, Russian losses in the war have been visually confirmed at 1,037 BMP-1s of various variants (793 destroyed, 33 damaged, 103 abandoned, and 108 captured). Ukrainian losses have been confirmed at 495 various BMP-1s (387 destroyed, 15 damaged, 33 abandoned, 60 captured).

=== Others ===
Other BMP operators have included Poland, Egypt, Syria, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Afghanistan, India, Iraq, North Korea, East Germany, Greece, Slovakia, Sweden, Cambodia and Vietnam.

<text>The BMP-2 (&quot;Boyevaya Mashina Pekhoty&quot;, , literally &quot;combat machine/vehicle (of the) infantry&quot;) is an amphibious infantry fighting vehicle introduced in the 1980s in the Soviet Union, following on from the BMP-1 of the 1960s.

== Development history ==


Although the BMP-1 was a revolutionary design, its main armament, the 2A28 Grom and the 9S428 ATGM launcher capable of firing 9M14 Malyutka (NATO: AT-3A Sagger A) and 9M14M Malyutka-M (NATO: AT-3B Sagger B) ATGMs, quickly became obsolete. Therefore, the Soviet Union decided to produce an updated and improved version of the BMP-1. The main emphasis was put on improving the main armament. In 1972, work got under-way to develop an improved version of the BMP-1.

During its combat debut in the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, Egyptian and Syrian BMPs proved vulnerable to .50 calibre machine-gun fire in the sides and rear, and to 105 mm M40 recoilless rifles. The 2A28 Grom proved inaccurate beyond 500 metres, and the 9M14 Malyutka missile could not be guided effectively from the confines of the turret.

Several Soviet technical teams were sent to Syria in the wake of the war to gather information. These lessons, combined with observations of western AFV developments, resulted in a replacement project for the original BMP in 1974. The result was the BMP-1P upgrade, which was intended as a stopgap to address the most serious problems with the existing design.

Smoke grenade launchers were added to the rear of the turret and the manually guided 9M14 Malyutka missile system was replaced with the semi-automatically guided 9K111 Fagot / 9M113 Konkurs system. The BMP-1P was in production by the late 1970s. Existing BMP-1s were gradually upgraded to the BMP-1P standard during the 1980s.

== Design ==

The BMP-2 is broadly similar to the BMP-1. The most significant changes are:
* The commander now sits with the gunner in an enlarged, two-man turret.
* Armament changed to the 2A42 30 mm autocannon and the 9P135M ATGM launcher capable of firing SACLOS guided 9M111 &quot;Fagot&quot; (AT-4 Spigot), 9M113 &quot;Konkurs&quot; (AT-5 Spandrel) and 9M113M &quot;Konkurs-M&quot; (AT-5B Spandrel B) anti-tank missiles.
* Only seven troops can be carried instead of eight.
* Two rear infantry roof hatches instead of four.
* Slightly improved armour.

=== Layout ===

In the centre of the vehicle is the welded steel turret, which seats the commander and gunner, both of whom have hatches. The commander sits to the right and has three day-vision periscopes, a 1PZ-3 day-sight designed for anti-aircraft use with 1.2× and 4× magnification, an OU-3GA2 infra-red searchlight, a TNP-165A designator and a TKN-3B binocular sight with 4.75× day magnification and 4× night-sight magnification.

The gunner sits to the commander&#x27;s left and has a smaller rectangular hatch with a rearward-facing day periscope. There are three other day periscopes facing forward and left. The gunner has a BPK-1-42 binocular sight with a moon/starlight vision range of 650 metres, or 350 metres using the infra-red searchlight, and a TNPT-1 designator. An FG-126 infra-red searchlight is mounted coaxially to the 30 mm cannon.

The driver sits in the front left of the vehicle, with the engine in a separate compartment to his right. The driver has his own entry hatch above him, with three day-vision periscopes. The centre TNPO-170A periscope can be replaced with either a TNPO-350B extended periscope for amphibious operation or a TVNE-1PA night vision scope. An infantryman sits immediately behind the driver, and has a firing port and vision block. TNPO-170A periscopes are used throughout the vehicle and are electrically heated.

In the BMP-1 and BMP-2, ammunition is stored near or even inside the compartment, which can lead to a catastrophic failure in case of a hull breach.

=== Mobility ===
The BMP-1 and BMP-2 share the same chassis and have almost identical road performance. The BMP-2 is heavier, but also has a more powerful engine to compensate.

The BMP-2 is amphibious with little preparation, using hydrodynamic fairings to convert track momentum into water jets. Peacetime regulations require that any BMPs entering water must have a working radio set, since its bearings are not airtight and it can be carried away by currents in case of loss of engine power (the vehicle lacks an anchor).

=== Weapons ===
The main armament is a turret with a stabilized 30 mm 2A42 autocannon with dual ammunition feeds, which provide a choice of 3UBR6 AP-T and 3UOR6 HE-T / 3UOF8 HE-I ammunition and 9M113 Konkurs ATGM. The gun has a selectable rate of fire, either slow at 200 to 300 rounds per minute or fast at 550 rounds per minute. This gives a continuous fire time of 100–150 seconds (or only 55 seconds, depending on the rate of fire chosen) before running out of ammunition. The original stabilization provides reasonable accuracy up to a speed of about 35 kilometres per hour.

The AP-T ammunition can penetrate 15 millimetres of armour at sixty degrees at 1,500 metres. A new APDS-T tungsten round can penetrate 25 millimetres at the same distance. A typical ammunition load is 160 rounds of AP ammunition and 340 rounds of HE ammunition. The ammunition sits in two trays located on the turret rear floor. The gun can be fired from either the commander&#x27;s or the gunner&#x27;s station.

The commander&#x27;s 1PZ-3 sight is specifically designed for anti-aircraft operation. Combined with the high maximum elevation of 74 degrees, it allows the 30 mm cannon to be used effectively against helicopters and slow flying aircraft. The turret traverse and elevation are powered and it can traverse 360 degrees in 10.28 seconds and elevate through 74 degrees in 12.33 seconds.

Reloading the BMP-2&#x27;s 30 mm cannon can be somewhat problematic and can take up to two hours, even if the ammunition is prepared. The cannon is normally only used on the slow rate of fire, otherwise, fumes from the weapon would build up in the turret faster than the extractor fan can remove them.

The effective range of the 30 mm cannon is up to 1,500 metres against armour, 4,000 metres against ground targets, and 2,500 metres against air targets.

A coaxial 7.62 mm PKT machine gun is mounted to the left of the 30 mm cannon. 2,000 rounds of ammunition are carried for it. On the roof of the turret is an ATGM launcher. On Russian vehicles this fires 9M113 Konkurs missiles. On export models it normally fires 9K111 Fagot missiles. A ground-mount for the missile is carried, allowing it to be used away from the vehicle. The missiles are a substantial improvement on the 9M14 Malyutka missiles used on the BMP-1, in both range and accuracy.

Behind the turret is the troop compartment that holds six troops. A seventh sits just behind the driver. The troops sit back to back, along the center of the vehicle. Down each side of the compartment are three firing ports with periscopes. Access to the compartment is by the two rear doors, which hold fuel tanks. Both doors have integral periscopes. The left door has a firing port.

In addition to the main weapons, it can carry a man-portable surface-to-air missile launcher and two missiles, and an RPG launcher and five rounds. The vehicle is fitted with a PAZ overpressure NBC system and fire suppression system, and carries a GPK-59 gyrocompass.

=== Countermeasures ===
The original BMP-1 had a vulnerability in its mine protection scheme, which only became obvious during the war in Afghanistan. The one-man-turret fighting vehicle seated its driver and commander in tandem layout, in the front-left side of the hull alongside the diesel engine. When a BMP-1 hit a tilt-rod anti-tank land mine its steeply sloped lower front glacis armour plate allowed the mine&#x27;s arming rod to tilt with little resistance until the maximum deflection was reached, at which time the mine was already well under the chassis.

When it subsequently detonated, the blast usually killed both the driver and the vehicle commander. This shortcoming was addressed in the BMP-2 design, where the tank commander shares the well-armoured two-man turret with the gunner. The driver&#x27;s station has been enlarged and he is provided with an armored driver&#x27;s seat, in addition to extra belly armor in the lower front.

The IFV lacks the ability to install add-on protection packages like slat armor cages or explosive reactive armor (ERA). The BMP-2&#x27;s armor is very similar to the original BMP-1, resistant to 23 mm armor-piercing rounds on its frontal arc from 500 meters (and immune to 12.7 mm armor-piercing from the same angle) and to 7.62x39 mm armor-piercing rounds to its sides. Its armor is slightly thinner than the BMP-1&#x27;s but the higher-quality steel used in its construction grants it the same effective protection.

The basic hull armor on the BMP-2 can be easily penetrated by any shaped-charge missile, from the 66 mm LAW on up. One important modification carried out as the result of operational experience in Afghanistan was the fitting of a second layer of stand-off armor, usually a high resistant ballistic rubber-like material, to act as spaced armour around the top of the hull sides and around the turret.

According to Russian sources, the vehicles repaired as of November 2023 are equipped with attachments to install additional protection kits.

== Service history ==

In the Soviet Army, BMPs were typically issued to the motor rifle battalions of tank regiments. In a typical motor-rifle division, one motor-rifle regiment had BMPs, the other two had wheeled BTRs.

Proliferation varied greatly among the rest of the Warsaw Pact nations. For example, at least some East German motor-rifle divisions were recorded to have all three motor-rifle regiments with BMPs, ranging down to the Romanian and Bulgarian Armies, some of whose divisions had no BMPs at all.

Poland planned to replace its BWP-1 with BWP-2 (BMP-2 and BMP-2D); but, because of financial problems, only ordered 62 vehicles in 1988, which were delivered in 1989. Since obtaining a sufficient number of BWP-2 vehicles after the political changes of 1989 became impossible, Poland was forced to abandon this plan. The 62 BWP-2 that Poland bought were sold to Angola in 1995.

<doc id="222949" wikidata="Q1470010" url="?curid=222949" title="Front Line Assembly">
<text>Front Line Assembly (FLA) is a Canadian electro-industrial band formed by Bill Leeb in 1986 after leaving Skinny Puppy. FLA has developed its own sound incorporating elements of electronic body music and electro-industrial. The band&#x27;s membership has rotated through the years, including Michael Balch, Rhys Fulber, and Chris Peterson, all of whom are associated with several other acts.

Since their inception, the group have produced over a dozen studio albums and EPs, several of which have charted on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Dance/Electronic Album chart. The albums &quot;Tactical Neural Implant&quot; and &quot;Hard Wired&quot; are two of the group&#x27;s most successful records, the former being considered a classic among industrial music fans. They have also produced soundtracks for video games such as &quot;Quake III: Team Arena&quot; (a collaboration with Sonic Mayhem) and &quot;AirMech&quot;.

Over the years, the band&#x27;s name has sometimes been published as &quot;Front Line Assembly&quot;, and sometimes as &quot;Frontline Assembly&quot;. The former spelling is the most common, and the band&#x27;s members have stated that the version with three separate words is preferred.

==History==

===Formation (1985–1986)===
Between 1985 and 1986, Bill Leeb performed with Skinny Puppy under the name Wilhelm Schroeder, a combination of his first name and the name of the Peanuts character and was meant as a joke. Leeb had no musical training, and learned to play synthesizer while contributing bass synth and backing vocals for the band. He also supported their 1985 tour. Not prepared for another tour, Leeb left Skinny Puppy in early 1986.

Having developed some instrumental skills and music industry experience, and wanting to do more vocal work, Leeb decided to take the risk of starting his own project. Leeb decided to call the project Front Line Assembly to reflect his belief that strength lies in working together.

Leeb started by producing a demo tape, &quot;Nerve War&quot;, which was distributed on a limited basis. Contacts in the music scene he had gathered while with Skinny Puppy led to contract offers from the first two labels that Leeb later approached with cassettes.

Around this time, Leeb and Rhys Fulber became friends when they discovered they both had a similar interest in underground music. As an unofficial member at this time, Fulber partnered with Leeb during the production of &quot;Total Terror&quot; and was credited for the song &quot;Black Fluid&quot; on the demo. Both demo releases were limited to 100 and mostly distributed amongst friends.

===Early releases and Michael Balch (1987–1989)===
The band members were influenced by early electronic and industrial acts from Europe such as Kraftwerk, Cabaret Voltaire, Portion Control, D.A.F., Test Dept, SPK, and Severed Heads, but mainly by the electronic body music style of Front 242.

The first appearance of Front Line Assembly was the track &quot;Aggression&quot;, which was included on the compilation &quot;For Your Ears Only&quot;, released in 1987 by British independent record label Third Mind showcasing the label&#x27;s repertoire at the time. The track would be re-released the following year on the &quot;Disorder&quot; EP. Although the contact to Third Mind would later develop into a long-standing collaboration, the band debuted its first album &quot;The Initial Command&quot; with credited assistance by Fulber and Michael Balch on Belgian independent record label KK at the end of 1987. The album had been produced on a tight budget which would determine whether or not cuts would be done with an eight track system or split into two four track cuts. 
With the next album &quot;State of Mind&quot;, released in January 1988, the band switched to German independent label Dossier. They changed labels as Leeb did not want to be bound to one label, so the releases were issued only on European labels.

In 1988, Balch became an official band member and began writing songs alongside Leeb for the next few albums. Balch mostly contributed by providing keyboards and programming. This partnership produced the releases &quot;Corrosion&quot; and &quot;Disorder&quot;. A planned release on the Canadian label Nettwerk fell through, and the two finished masters were issued instead by Third Mind in 1988. After the releases in 1988, Third Mind signed Front Line Assembly to a three album deal. Through Levermore &quot;Corrosion&quot; was licensed to Wax Trax!. Both records were re-released together with three more unreleased tracks on the compilations &quot;Convergence&quot; later that year and &quot;Corroded Disorder&quot; in 1995.

Adhering to Third Mind for Europe and Wax Trax! for North America resulted in better availability of the albums in both places, and the signing with Third Mind attracted the attention of established music magazines, including &quot;Melody Maker&quot; or &quot;NME&quot; as well as the underground magazine &quot;Music From the Empty Quarter&quot;.

Front Line Assembly produced their next album &quot;Gashed Senses &amp; Crossfire&quot; in 1989. This album introduced their first single &quot;Digital Tension Dementia&quot; which became their first chart success and peaked at position 45 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Songs chart. In support of their latest release, the band, together with Fulber as live metal percussionist, headed out to Europe and North America for their first tour. However, during the show in London in July 1989 their first live album &quot;Live&quot; was recorded under unfavourable circumstances. Presumably not well attended, the audience&#x27;s reactions at the show had to be reworked. For Balch it was also the last Front Line Assembly tour because he parted ways to join Ministry and Revolting Cocks.

===Rhys Fulber and growing popularity (1990–1999)===
Filling the void left by Balch&#x27;s departure, Fulber officially joined. The two musicians had similar tastes, both being enthusiastic about electronic music. The duo recorded their next album, &quot;Caustic Grip&quot;, in the first half of 1990. Accompanied by the release of two singles in 1990, &quot;Iceolate&quot; and &quot;Provision&quot;, the album raised Front Line Assembly&#x27;s profile in the industrial music scene and in the media considerably. Melody Maker elected both album singles &quot;Single of the week&quot; while the promotional video for &quot;Iceolate&quot; received some airplay on MTV.

On &quot;Caustic Grip&quot; the band started working with Greg Reely which would evolve into a long-term partnership. The tour in support of the album started in January 1991 in the United States to be followed by a European leg in February which was accompanied by the release of stand-alone single &quot;Virus&quot; the same month. Chris Peterson, who would later become a full-time member of Front Line Assembly, gave his debut for the band on this tour, completing the live line-up as percussionist.

In 1992, Front Line Assembly reached a turning point in the band&#x27;s musical style with the album &quot;Tactical Neural Implant&quot;. The media, including &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Siren Magazine and fanzine Industrial Strength all commented particularly on the more melodious approach featured on the album and noted the use of multi-layered sounds which would become a trademark of the band. Asked about this composing style by Industrial Nation, Leeb explained that the band continually experimented with new ways to use technology to make each recording different, and had focused on clarity and sustain in their instrumentation and structure in their songs.

The video for the first single off the album, &quot;Mindphaser&quot;, was awarded &quot;Best Alternative Video&quot; at Much Music&#x27;s 1992 Canadian Music Video Awards. In August 1992, Front Line Assembly embarked on a tour that covered Northern America and Europe. The album continues to be played in industrial and electronic music dance clubs and is considered a classic among listeners and musicians of industrial music.

In 1993, the band contributed 5 remixes to Fear Factory&#x27;s EP &quot;Fear Is the Mindkiller&quot;; working on the EP would eventually influence the band&#x27;s next album &quot;Millennium&quot; (1994), which featured a combination of metal guitars, electronic music, and media sampling (much of which was taken from the Michael Douglas film &quot;Falling Down&quot;) which had become one of the characteristics of industrial rock and industrial metal during the 1990s. &quot;Hard Wired&quot; (1995) and the world tour following the release was FLA&#x27;s most successful commercial and critical period. Leeb has stated he was influenced to pursue this style of music after listening to Pantera&#x27;s &quot;Walk&quot;, which he later incorporated into the single &quot;Surface Patterns&quot;.

In September 1996 the band made a live performance in Vancouver for the MuchMusic Video Awards which was broadcast via satellite.

In 1997, Fulber left the band to concentrate on producing Fear Factory with other bands. Chris Peterson, who had already supported the band&#x27;s live shows, replaced Fulber. Soon after Fulber&#x27;s departure, the album &quot;[FLA]vour of the Weak&quot; was released. Yet again, the album was stylistically divergent from previous releases. The metal influences found in &quot;Millennium&quot; gave way to a more electronica sound within the new release.

Front Line Assembly returned somewhat to their former sound with the album &quot;Implode&quot; (1999). Front Line Assembly composed the soundtrack for the video game, &quot;Quake III Team Arena&quot; and was composing music for the video game Millennium Four: The Right that was later cancelled. In October 1999, it was made public that the band had left their label Metropolis.

===Success in the new millennium (2000–2011)===
The band followed up &quot;Implode&quot; with the 2001 album &quot;Epitaph&quot;. This was the final album worked on by Peterson before departing in 2002. The album was a critical success and spawned the single &quot;Everything Must Perish&quot;. The album also marked the band&#x27;s return to Metropolis records.

Fulber rejoined the band in 2003. The reunited duo released the single &quot;Maniacal&quot; in October of that year. The single peaked at No. 15 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Dance Singles. The next year, they released the studio album &quot;Civilization&quot;, which landed the No. 2 position on the German Alternative Albums chart. Peterson later rejoined the band to release &quot;Artificial Soldier&quot; in 2006. It was the first album to feature new members Jeremy Inkel and Jared Slingerland. The album peaked on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Dance/Electronic Albums chart at No. 19. After a problem with the tour bus company, the US tour that year was cut short, and the band returned home to Vancouver after playing roughly half of their scheduled dates; performances in New York and Canada were cancelled. The band toured in Europe in August 2006, playing in 18 cities.

In April 2007, Front Line Assembly released a remix album titled &quot;Fallout&quot;. The album was released in a 4-panel digipak and featured three previously unreleased tracks (&quot;Electric Dreams,&quot; &quot;Unconscious,&quot; and &quot;Armageddon&quot;) and nine remixes by several other Industrial acts and names. After the release of the remix album, the band went out to tour North America and Europe.

In 2010, Front Line Assembly released two new singles, &quot;Shifting Through the Lens&quot; and &quot;Angriff&quot;, and an album, &quot;Improvised Electronic Device&quot;; &quot;I.E.D.&quot; saw the band embrace a heavier, more guitar-driven sound, much like &quot;Millenium&quot;. The album reached No. 23 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Dance/Electronic Albums chart and was supported by a series of tours throughout North America and Europe. Peterson once more left the band, starting a T-shirt company with his brother. The band completed the line-up with live drummer Jason Bazinet.

===Back to electronic roots and new influences (2012–2018)===
Having integrated guitars into their sound since the late 1980s, either sampled or as live guitars, FLA returned in 2012 to making exclusively electronic music. This change was heard on the soundtrack album &quot;AirMech&quot; for the video game of the same name at the end of 2012. Comprising only instrumental tracks, &quot;AirMech&quot; laid some grounds for 2013 full-length album &quot;Echogenetic&quot; &quot;Echogenetic&quot; was widely praised by critics, who also noted the dubstep influences on the record, and hit the charts in the United States and in Germany. Entering the official German charts was a first in the band&#x27;s history. On the occasion of the release of &quot;Echogenetic&quot; Front Line Assembly announced a remix album which was released in May 2014 under the moniker of &quot;Echoes&quot;.

Shortly after the release of &quot;Echogenetic&quot; the band started promoting the album with an extensive tour schedule in Europe and North America. In August 2013, Front Line Assembly covered dates in Russia, Germany, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and the UK. They continued their tour in Europe in June 2014, playing shows in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Sweden, Finland and France, this time also in support of &quot;Echoes&quot;. Former member Fulber joined the band for their last European leg in October and November 2014 in Poland and Germany, where they performed with a philharmonic orchestra in Leipzig, a first for the band.

The same month Front Line Assembly returned from Europe, they were asked on short notice to join Leeb&#x27;s former band Skinny Puppy on their &quot;Eye vs Spy&quot; North American tour as supporting band after VNV Nation, previously booked for the slot, had opted out. On some dates, Fulber joined them. At the Vancouver show Leeb performed with Skinny Puppy on their encore song Assimilate.

Resuming tour activities, the band gave a number of concerts in September and November 2015. They started off with a show in Vancouver and went on to headline the second day of the Cold Waves industrial festival in Chicago. The accompanying festival CD, released in October, featured an exclusive remix of &quot;Next War&quot; from Slighter. In November the band followed up with their first show in Mexico City, supported by Mexican electro-industrial band Hocico, and a gig in Guadalajara both of which were also supported by Canadian electro-industrial group Decoded Feedback.

October 2014 saw the return of former long-time band member Rhys Fulber, joining Front Line Assembly on their European tour. In late October 2016, the band announced that a new album was in the making, including contributions by Rhys Fulber, In March 2017 an announcement followed that the successor of sound track album &quot;AirMech&quot; was ready for release. The band supported industrial rock band Revolting Cocks on their North American tour the same year.

Keyboardist Jeremy Inkel died January 23, 2018, due to complications resulting from an asthma condition, at the age of 34.

===Leeb and Fulber continue as duo (2018–present)===

In March 2018 the band announced a joint European tour with German electro-industrial band Die Krupps under the moniker of &quot;The Machinists United Tour 2018&quot;. The tour will be preceded by the release of the soundtrack album &quot;WarMech&quot;, successor of 2015&#x27;s AirMech, in June. Also, the band completed work on their 17th studio album, &quot;Wake Up the Coma&quot;, which was released in February 2019.

In October 2020, the band announced a brand new album, called &quot;Mechanical Soul&quot; is due out on January 15, 2021. It will reportedly feature guest appearances from Jean-Luc De Meyer of Front 242 and Dino Cazares of Fear Factory.

The band were set to perform as a part of the industrial strength tour, alongside bands Ministry and Helmet, scheduled for late 2021. KMFDM were originally planned to be a part of the tour, but were later replaced with Helmet. The 25-date tour was originally slated for July 2020, but was pushed to March 2021 due to COVID-19. This was pushed back again to October 2021, because of the ongoing uncertainty with the development of the pandemic. However, in September 2021, Ministry announced that they were once again postponing the industrial strength tour due to safety concerns related to the pandemic, this time with the Melvins and Corrosion of Conformity as support. In response to this, Front Line Assembly released a statement via social media, alleging that Ministry had never explained why they were dropping them from the tour or given them forewarning of this, and expressing disappointment with the way that the situation was handled. The band proceeded to announce a headlining US tour for Spring 2022 and a second European co-headline tour with Die Krupps scheduled for August 2022.

Coinciding with &quot;The Machinists Reunited Tour&quot; in August 2022, Cleopatra issued a remastered collection of Front Line Assembly&#x27;s early works. &quot;Permanent Data 1986-1989&quot; comprises the demo compilations &quot;Total Terror I&quot; and &quot;Total Terror II&quot;, the regular releases &quot;State of Mind&quot;, &quot;Corrosion&quot; and &quot;Disorder&quot; as well as the band&#x27;s first live album. At the same time, Cleopatra re-released the band&#x27;s remastered first demo &quot;Nerve War&quot;.

== Musical style ==
The band has explored many music genres across their releases, including: Industrial, industrial rock, industrial metal, electronic body music and electro-industrial.

=== Development ===
Although being established as a largely industrial project, the band is known to take liberty in adapting their sound across many of their releases over the years. The band&#x27;s early catalogue has been largely described as electronic body music, industrial and electro-industrial from &quot;Total Terror&quot; to &quot;Gashed Senses and Crossfire&quot;. Rhys Fulber has featured as a prominent collaborator with Leeb across many FLA releases, as both found they have a shared interest in electronic music. Fulber officially replaced longtime member Michael Balch on &quot;Caustic Grip&quot;, who was busy with other projects at the time. Fulber has since worked on and off with the band across several releases, he rejoined as a member in 2014.

&quot;Caustic Grip&quot; (1990) marked a shift to industrial rock on the single &quot;Provision&quot;, featuring guitar work that would later be featured much more extensively on the next several albums. The opening track (&quot;Resist&quot;) also features guitar, which is uncredited and is possibly a sample. &quot;Tactical Neural Implant&quot; released soon after in 1992 and marked a major change in the band&#x27;s sound, exploring more melodic and electronic styles throughout the album. The album was the first to feature widespread use of multiple film and instrumental samples, another element to be expanded on later. The release is considered one of the band&#x27;s very best by fans and critics alike.

&quot;Millennium&quot; (1994) then followed and became the band&#x27;s first industrial metal record, containing several guitar samples from prominent metal bands such as Pantera (&quot;Walk&quot;) alongside the session guitar work of Devin Townsend, who also appears on the follow-up &quot;Hard Wired&quot; (1995). The inclusion of guitars has since become common on recent FLA albums, such as &quot;Improvised Electronic Device&quot; (2010), though not a permanent change.

[&quot;FLA]vour of the Weak&quot; (1997) is similar to &quot;Tactical Neural Implant&quot;, though it has significant electronica and big beat influences and is possibly the band&#x27;s most melodic and musically varied album in their entire catalogue. The album largely eschews previously used guitars and samples, featuring a more stripped-down sound. &quot;Flavour&quot;&#x27; and the next two releases, &quot;Implode&quot; (1999) and &quot;Epitaph&quot; (2001), featured Chris Peterson as a collaborator (including future albums) before the return of Fulber on &quot;Civilization&quot; (2004). &quot;Echogenetic&quot; (2013) saw the band incorporate dubstep into their music, which was popular at the time.

The band released a soundtrack album titled &quot;AirMech&quot; in 2012, followed by &quot;WarMech&quot; in 2018. The albums feature a continuation of the electronica style of the band&#x27;s later material. The first is the eponymous soundtrack of the game and the latter is for the game&#x27;s sequel, titled &quot;AirMech Wastelands.&quot;

<text>The Douglas B-18 Bolo is an American twin-engined medium bomber which served with the United States Army Air Corps and the Royal Canadian Air Force (as the Digby) during the late 1930s and early 1940s. The Bolo was developed by the Douglas Aircraft Company from their DC-2 as a replacement for the Martin B-10.

By 1940 standards, it was slow, had an inadequate defensive armament, and carried too small a bomb load. By 1942, surviving B-18s were relegated to antisubmarine, training and transport duties. A B-18 was one of the first USAAF aircraft to sink a German U-boat, on 22 August 1942 in the Caribbean.

In 1934, the United States Army Air Corps requested for a twin-engine bomber with double the bomb load and range of the Martin B-10 then entering service. During the evaluation at Wright Field the following year, Douglas offered its DB-1. It was competing against the Boeing Model 299 (later developed into the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress) and Martin 146.

While the Boeing design was clearly superior, the 299&#x27;s four engines eliminated it from consideration despite being the favorite, and the crash of the prototype — caused by taking off with the controls still locked — put its purchase on hold. The Martin 146 was a minor improvement on the B-10, and was never seriously considered. During the depths of the Great Depression, the lower price of the DB-1 at $58,500 compared to $99,620 for the Model 299 also favored the Douglas entry, and it was ordered into immediate production in January 1936 as the B-18.

The DB-1 design was modified from that of the DC-2. The wingspan was greater, the fuselage was narrower and deeper, and the wings were moved up to a mid-wing position to allow space under the spars for an enclosed bomb bay. Added armament included manually operated nose, dorsal, and ventral gun turrets.

At one point, Preston Tucker&#x27;s firm received a contract to supply Tucker remote controlled gun turrets but these were unsuccessful, and were never used in service.

==Operational history==

The initial contract called for 133 B-18s (including the prototype), using Wright R-1820 radial engines. The last B-18 of the run, designated DB-2 by the company, had a power-operated nose turret in a redesigned nose but this did not become standard. Additional contracts in 1937 (177 aircraft) and 1938 (40 aircraft) were for the B-18A, which had the bombardier&#x27;s position further forward over the nose-gunner&#x27;s station in a wedge shaped nose and the B-18A was fitted with more powerful engines.

Deliveries of B-18s to Army units began in the first half of 1937, with the first examples being test and evaluation aircraft being turned over to the Materiel Division at Wright Field, Ohio, the Technical Training Command at Chanute Field, Illinois, the Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, and Lowry Field, Colorado. Deliveries to operational groups began in late 1937, the first being the 7th Bombardment Group at Hamilton Field, California.

Production B-18s, with full military equipment, had a maximum speed of , cruising speed of , and combat range of . By 1940, most USAAC bomber squadrons were equipped with B-18s or B-18As.

However, the B-18/B-18A&#x27;s deficiencies were made apparent when an all-red Soviet Ilyushin TsKB-30 named &quot;Moskva&quot; (a prototype for the twin-engine DB-3 which flew the same year as the B-18) made a non-stop flight from Moscow to North America in April 1939, a distance of , which was well beyond the capabilities of the B-18. The TsKB-30/DB-3 was also 25% faster, was capable of carrying a bomb load 2.5 times as large as the B-18, and carried a heavier defensive armament. In August of the same year, a Japanese Mitsubishi G3M2 named &quot;Nippon&quot; (which also had its first flight the same year as the B-18) flew from Tokyo to the US, and then around the world, with the stage from Chitose, Hokkaido to Nome, Alaska being over . The military version (code named &quot;Nell&quot; during WW2) could also carry more than the B-18, further, faster, and was also better armed. Both types had roughly higher service ceilings as well.

The Air Corps conceded that the Bolo was obsolete and unsuitable for its intended role. However, in spite of this, the B-18/B-18A was still the most numerous American bomber type deployed outside the continental United States at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The B-18 would be a stopgap until the more capable Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator became available in quantity.

===World War II===
When war came to the Pacific, most of the B-18/B-18A aircraft based overseas in the Philippines and in Hawaii were destroyed on the ground in the initial Japanese onslaught. The few Bolos that remained played no significant role in subsequent operations.

The B-18s remaining in the continental US and in the Caribbean were then deployed in a defensive role in anticipation of attacks on the US mainland. These attacks never materialized. B-17s supplanted B-18s in first-line service in 1942. Following this, 122 B-18As were modified for anti-submarine warfare. The bombardier was replaced by a search radar with a large radome. Magnetic anomaly detection (MAD) equipment was sometimes housed in a tail boom. These aircraft, designated B-18B, were used in the Caribbean on anti-submarine patrol. On 2 October 1942, a B-18A, piloted by Captain Howard Burhanna Jr. of the 99th Bomb Squadron, depth charged and sank the north of Cayenne, French Guiana.

Two aircraft were transferred to the Brazilian Air Force in 1942, and were used with a provisional conversion training unit set up under the provisions of Lend-Lease. They were later used for anti-submarine patrols. They were struck off at the end of the war.

In 1940 the Royal Canadian Air Force acquired 20 B-18As (as the Douglas Digby Mark I), and also used them for patrol duties, being immediately issued to 10 Squadron to replace the squadron&#x27;s Westland Wapitis.

Bolos and Digbys sank an additional two submarines during the course of the war. RCAF Eastern Air Command (EAC) Digbys carried out 11 attacks on U-boats. was confirmed sunk by Flying Officer F. Raymes&#x27; crew of No. 10 (BR) Squadron, on 30 October 1942. east of Newfoundland. However, the antisubmarine role was relatively short-lived, and the Bolos were superseded in this role in 1943 by B-24 Liberators, which had a much heavier payload and a substantially longer range, which finally closed the mid-Atlantic gap. Some of the Douglas Digbys in Canadian service were converted into transports or used for training.

Surviving USAAF B-18s ended their useful lives in training and transport roles, and saw no further combat action. Two B-18As were modified as unarmed cargo transports under the designation C-58. At the end of the war, remaining examples were sold as surplus on the commercial market. Some postwar B-18s were operated as cargo or crop-spraying aircraft by commercial operators.

==Aircraft on display==
Six B-18s are known to exist, five of them preserved or under restoration in museums in the United States, and one is a wreck still located at its crash site:

;B-18
* 36-446 – Kohala Mountains, Hawaii. Tail code &quot;81 50R&quot;. Crashed in 1941 and abandoned. The Air Force recovered the nose turret for 37-029 and the dorsal turret for 37-469. The Pacific Air Museum in Honolulu has had plans to recover the airframe.
* 37-029 – Castle Air Museum at the former Castle Air Force Base in Atwater, California. Dropped from USAAF inventory in 1944, it was registered as NC52056 in 1945, later to N52056. The B-18 was used by Avery Aviation and then Hawkins and Powers, as a firebomber, dropping borate for many years.

;B-18A

* 37-469 – National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. One of the first production Bolos, was delivered to Wright Field in 1937 for evaluation testing. Sold as N56847, converted to crop sprayer; by May 1969 stored derelict at Tucson, Arizona. It sat outdoors for many years, before being restored to static display condition. This aircraft has an incorrect dorsal turret. The museum has been attempting to locate a correct turret for this aircraft for many years.
* 39-025 – Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum at the former Lowry Air Force Base in Denver, Colorado. This Bolo spent World War II at several airfields as a bombardier trainer and as a light transport. It was dropped from inventory on 3 November 1944, and was later sold, acquiring the civil registry NC62477. It spent 14 years on the civil registry before going to Cuba in 1958. In November 1958 the aircraft was seized in Florida by US Treasury agents when it was hauling guns to Fidel Castro. In 1960, the aircraft was parked at Cannon AFB, New Mexico, until being presented to the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB. It flew to the museum in April 1961. In 1988, the aircraft was transferred to the Wings Over The Rockies Aviation and Space Museum where it was restored through the 1990s. It is displayed there as AAC Ser. No. 39-522.

;B-18A/B

* 37-505 – On display at McChord Air Museum, Washington. Built as a B-18, converted during WWII to B-18B. Later sold as N67947 for agricultural chemical spraying, then Mexican registration XB-LAJ transporting fish. Donated to Tucson Air Museum Foundation, Pima County, Arizona, this was the last flyable B-18, making its final flight to Tucson on 10 April 1971. Subsequently acquired by the National Museum of the United States Air Force and stored at Davis-Monthan AFB until moved by C-5A to McChord Air Museum in 1983 for restoration. Rebuilt as model B-18A and displayed from 2007.

;B-18B

* 38-593 – Pima Air &amp; Space Museum adjacent to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona. This Bolo spent the early part of WWII on anti-submarine patrol. In 1943 began use a light transport. She was retired and struck from the inventory in 1945. Was operated as a firebomber as N66267, 1954–1970. In storage at Phoenix Goodyear Airport, Litchfield Park, Arizona by September 1969, then delivered to Pima on 5 September 1976. The aircraft sat outside in the desert for many years, before being restored and moved indoors for display. The aircraft is still equipped with an antisubmarine search radar dome.

<text>Air Vanuatu is an airline with its head office in Air Vanuatu House, Port Vila, Vanuatu. It is Vanuatu&#x27;s national flag carrier, formerly operating to Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia and points in the South Pacific. Its main base is Bauerfield International Airport, Port Vila. In May 2024 operations ceased with the airline placed into liquidation by the Government of Vanuatu. Limited domestic services resumed in August 2024.

== History ==
=== Foundation and early years ===
Air Vanuatu was established in 1981 after Vanuatu gained independence from the United Kingdom and France the previous year. The assistance of Ansett Airlines was sought, and a five-year agreement put in place for Ansett to provide aircraft and operating staff. Ansett also took a 40% stake in the new airline, the government of Vanuatu holding the other 60%. The first Air Vanuatu flight, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-31 owned and operated by Ansett, departed Sydney for Port Vila on 5 September 1981. In May 1982 a Boeing 737-200 of Polynesian Airlines replaced the DC-9; this was replaced in turn by an Ansett 737-200 in October 1985. In March 1986, the agreement with Ansett expired and was not renewed; this had the effect of grounding the airline.

In 1987, the company was re-established with 100% ownership by the government of Vanuatu, after a new commercial agreement was signed with Australian Airlines; weekly Sydney – Port Vila flights re-commenced on 19 December using a Boeing 727-200 chartered from Australian. Air Vanuatu subsequently bought the aircraft in 1989 and leased it back to Australian for use on that airline&#x27;s network on days that it was not used by Air Vanuatu. In November 1992 the 727 was replaced by a Boeing 737-400 leased from Australian Airlines. The following year an Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante was also leased from Australian, entering service that April to operate flights between Port Vila and Nouméa. The leases on both aircraft continued after Australian was taken over by Qantas in October 1993, with the commercial agreement being rolled-over to Qantas as well. Qantas would be deeply involved in the airline&#x27;s operations for the rest of its existence; Air Vanuatu used the Qantas Frequent Flyer program, while Qantas codeshared on Air Vanuatu&#x27;s flights from Australia, and provided maintenance and pilot training services as well.

Air Vanuatu terminated the lease on the Qantas Boeing 737-400 after it took delivery of its own Boeing 737-300 in April 1997. The same month Bandeirante services ceased when a Saab 2000 entered service. The lease on the Saab 2000 was terminated in March 1999, and in June that year Air Vanuatu began using a de Havilland Canada Dash 8 from Vanuatu&#x27;s government-owned domestic carrier Vanair on weekly services to Nouméa. 

=== 21st century ===
In April 2001 Air Vanuatu merged with Vanair, however the merger was reversed only five months later. November 2003 an ATR 42 entered service for use on domestic routes in competition with Vanair. In September 2004, Air Vanuatu again merged with Vanair.

In January 2008, Air Vanuatu replaced its Boeing 737-300 with a new Boeing 737-800. Three Harbin Y-12s were added to the fleet in early 2009, and in October the same year the airline took delivery of a new ATR 72–500 aircraft to replace its ATR 42. Four days after the ATR 72 arrived at Port Vila, the Board of Air Vanuatu was sacked and replaced by Directors General of various Vanuatu government ministries. The ATR 72 made its first revenue flight for Air Vanuatu on 8 November 2009. A second ATR 72–500 was delivered to the airline in November 2014.

In 2016 the Harbin Y-12s were phased out and replaced by de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters.

In July 2020, Air Vanuatu announced a major set of changes for the airline due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With the reshuffling of orders and the shrinking and localization of the management team, the CEO Derek Nice stepped down, being temporarily replaced by Joseph Laloyer, until a replacement could be found. This included delaying the delivery of the four Airbus A220 aircraft it had on order, and a strategic review of its network.

In May 2024 the airline was placed into liquidation with EY appointed as liquidator. Due to the collapse of Air Vanuatu, 1,458 Vanuatuan seasonal workers were left stranded in New Zealand. Immigration New Zealand confirmed that it was working with employers to support the workers. The airline owed creditors US$74 million. At the time of being placed in administration, it had six aircraft and 441 employees across Vanuatu, Australia and New Zealand. Its biggest aircraft, a leased Boeing 737, was repossessed in Melbourne. It had also been reported that only two of the airlines&#x27; aircraft remained operational, due to awaited maintenance for the remaining fleet, while the available financial information of the company was deemed &quot;significantly out of date.&quot; 

On 22 May 2024, Solomon Airlines began weekly direct flights between Auckland and Port Vila to fill the gap left by Air Vanuatu.

In August 2024, limited domestic services resumed after an injection of funds by the Government of Vanuatu.

<text>The Battle of Sluys ( , ), also called the Battle of l&#x27;Écluse, was a naval battle fought on 24 June 1340 between England and France. It took place in the roadstead of the port of Sluys (French &quot;Écluse&quot;), on a since silted-up inlet between Zeeland and West Flanders. The English fleet of 120–150 ships was led by Edward III of England and the 230-strong French fleet by the Breton knight Hugues Quiéret, Admiral of France, and Nicolas Béhuchet, Constable of France. The battle was one of the opening engagements of the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

Edward sailed from the River Orwell on 22 June and encountered the French blocking his way to Sluys harbour. The French had bound their ships into three lines, forming large floating fighting platforms. The English fleet spent some time manoeuvring to gain the advantage of wind and tide. During this delay the French ships were driven to the east of their starting positions and became entangled with each other. Béhuchet and Quiéret ordered the ships to be separated and the fleet attempted to move back to the west, against the wind and the tide. While the French were in this disorganised state, the English attacked.

The English were able to manoeuvre against the French and defeat them in detail, capturing most of their ships. The French lost 16,000–20,000 men. The battle gave the English fleet naval supremacy in the English Channel. However, they were unable to take strategic advantage of this, and their success barely interrupted French raids on English territories and shipping. Operationally, the battle allowed the English army to land and to then besiege the French town of Tournai, albeit unsuccessfully.

==Background==
===Cause of war===

Since the Norman Conquest of 1066, English monarchs had held titles and lands within France, the possession of which made them vassals of the kings of France. French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose. Over the centuries, English holdings in France had varied in size, but by 1337 only Gascony in south-western France and Ponthieu in northern France were left. The independent-minded Gascons had their own customs and their own language. A large proportion of the red wine they produced was shipped to England in a profitable trade. The tax raised from this trade provided the English king with much of his revenue. The Gascons preferred their relationship with a distant English king, who left them alone, to one with a French king, who would interfere in their affairs. Following a series of disagreements between Philip VI of France () and Edward III of England (), on 24 May 1337 Philip&#x27;s Great Council in Paris agreed that the Duchy of Aquitaine, effectively Gascony, should be taken back into Philip&#x27;s hands on the grounds that Edward was in breach of his obligations as a vassal. This marked the start of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, which was to last 116 years.

===Opposing navies===
At the beginning of the war the French had the advantage at sea. Galleys had long been used by the Mediterranean powers and the French adopted them for use in the English Channel. Being shallow-draught vessels propelled by banks of oars the galleys could penetrate shallow harbours and were highly manoeuvrable, making them effective for raiding and ship-to-ship combat in meeting engagements. The French galleys were supplemented by galleys hired from Genoa and Monaco. The French were able to disrupt English commercial shipping, principally the Gascon wine and the Flanders wool trades, as well as raiding the south and east coasts of England at will. Operating the galleys was a specialist activity and called for highly trained crews, who were normally also drawn from Genoa, Monaco and, to a lesser extent, other Mediterranean ports.

The English did not have a purpose-built navy; Edward owned only three warships. The king relied on requisitioning cogs, the merchant vessels of English traders. Cogs had a deep draught, a round hull and were propelled by a single large sail set on a mast amidships. They were converted into warships by the addition of wooden &quot;castles&quot; at the bow and stern and the erection of crow&#x27;s nest platforms at the masthead. The cogs had a displacement of and were able to carry many fighting men. Their high freeboard made them superior to the oared vessels in close combat, particularly when they were fitted with castles from which arrows or bolts could be fired or stones dropped on to enemy craft alongside. By English common law, the crown was required to compensate the owners of ships impressed into service, but in practice, the king paid little and late, which caused shipowners to be reluctant to answer summonses to arms.

===Earlier activities===
In March 1338, the English town of Portsmouth was captured and razed by French galleys. Five English ships carrying wool were captured off Walcheren in September after a fierce fight known as the Battle of Arnemuiden. The lost ships included two of Edward&#x27;s three warships: the &quot;Christopher&quot; and the &quot;great cog&quot; &quot;Cog Edward&quot;. In October the major port of Southampton was captured and burnt down. The following year it was the turn of Hastings.

In 1339, there had been discontent among the Genoese mercenaries hired by the French, whose commander had not been passing on their pay. Believing the fault lay with their French paymasters, a deputation sought an audience with the French king in August. The deputation was jailed, causing the Genoese crews to mutiny and return to the Mediterranean. When the mutinous sailors arrived back in Genoa, they led an uprising that overthrew the ruling patricians. The new regime was disinclined to enter into new contracts with the French. When several ship captains were persuaded to do so, they were bribed by English agents to renege. In January 1340 the English successfully raided the port of Boulogne, where the majority of the French galley fleet was drawn up on the harbour beach and was inadequately guarded. Taking advantage of mist, the English surprised the French and destroyed 18 galleys, 24 other ships, large stocks of naval equipment and much of the harbour district before being driven off. The French were left with only 6 galleys, which they supplemented with 22 oared barges.

The loss of their galleys reduced the threat posed by the French to the English south coast and freed the English ships for offensive operations. During the winter and the spring of 1340, the French ports of Dieppe, Le Treport and Mers were successfully raided. The French fell back on the English expedient of requisitioning merchant ships. Philip ordered the collection of 200 ships, mostly Norman, into a &quot;Great Army of the Sea&quot;. Contemporary French documents record the fleet&#x27;s size as 202 vessels: 6 galleys, 7 royal warships, 22 oared barges and 167 merchant vessels. The crew complement was over 19,000, but they only included 150 men-at-arms and 500 crossbowmen. It was commanded by the Breton knight Hugues Quiéret, the Admiral of France, and Nicolas Béhuchet, the Grand Constable of France, the senior figure in the French military hierarchy. The six galleys were commanded by Pietro Barbavera, who had learnt his trade in the Mediterranean as a corsair.

Although Gascony was the cause of the war, Edward was able to spare few resources for it, and determined to campaign with his main force in north-eastern France in 1340. He wished to land his army and link up with his continental allies: several states of the Holy Roman Empire; and the Flemings, who had revolted against France during the winter and launched an April offensive, which had failed. A French offensive against these forces commenced on 18 May, meeting with mixed fortunes; Edward&#x27;s outnumbered allies were desperate for the English army to reinforce them.

===Sources===

There are numerous contemporary accounts of the battle, including three surviving letters written by Edward shortly afterwards. Several others are eyewitness accounts, but almost all are written from a partisan perspective: either English, French, or Flemish. For the most part they lack detail, so much so that the historian Kelly DeVries has commentated that for some aspects of the battle &quot;we have only a patchwork of interesting anecdotes to lead us to any conclusions.&quot; The best-known contemporary chronicler of this period of the Hundred Years&#x27; War is Jean Froissart and his &quot;Chronicles&quot; contain information missing from other surviving sources. The three redactions of his &quot;Chronicles&quot; differ from each other in many details of the battle and in their view of the reasons for its outcome.

==Prelude==
Edward had planned to ship his army to Sluys (modern Sluis), in Flemish Zeeland, in mid-April, but most English merchantmen, aware they were unlikely to receive the payments they were entitled to, were refusing to muster. In many cases they were probably bribing officials to turn a blind eye. The departure date was repeatedly postponed. On 4June the King&#x27;s Council decided to sail with what ships they had, even though they could only carry 600 men-at-arms. On 10 June the council received with consternation news that the Great Army of the Sea had arrived at Sluys, the main port of Flanders, on the 8th. Quiéret and Béhuchet had cut English communications with the continent. As they blocked the roadstead a further 11 ships reinforced them, bringing the total French strength to 213 ships. The entire Zwin estuary has silted up since the battle, and modern Sluis is from the sea.

An acrimonious meeting of the Council took place. A senior adviser, John de Stratford, Archbishop of Canterbury, insisted that putting to sea would risk the loss of the King and the whole expedition should be cancelled. Stratford stormed out of the council. The men in charge of the shipping arrangements were then personally abused by the King after they supported Stratford&#x27;s opinion. In a fury Edward declared &quot;Those who are afraid can stay at home&quot;. A string of instructions went out. Coastal defences were stripped. Peremptory orders were sent to royal officers to brook no excuses from tardy mariners. Edward personally harangued the shipowners of Yarmouth, the largest port in England. Meanwhile, the horses which had already been loaded were unloaded and the erstwhile transports were rapidly converted to warships by having forecastles, aftercastles and crow&#x27;s nests added. In a feat which the modern historian Jonathan Sumption describes as &quot;truly remarkable&quot; a sizeable fleet had been assembled at the Orwell by 20 June. The payroll records for the English fleet have been lost, so historians have relied on the estimates of chroniclers to ascertain the size of the fleet. Of the ships which sailed with it, 66 have been identified by name and it is believed it totalled between 120 and 150 ships. It carried 1,300 men-at-arms and 1,000 longbowmen. Edward&#x27;s lieutenants were the Earls of Northampton and Huntingdon. The fleet set sail early on 22 June 1340 and was in sight of the roadstead at Sluys by the afternoon of the following day. Edward anchored at Blankenberge and in the evening sent ashore Reginald Cobham, Sir John Chandos and Stephen Lambkin to reconnoitre the French fleet.

Edward&#x27;s intentions were well known; he wished to sail up the Zwin to Bruges and land his army to support his hard-pressed allies. When the English were sighted the French manoeuvred to bar Edward&#x27;s way to the port of Sluys. Their fleet organised itself in three lines, one behind the other, each stretching across the estuary of the Zwin. The ships of each line were bound together with chains and ropes to prevent the passage of enemy ships, &quot;like a line of castles&quot;. Several large ships were stationed in the front of the line, including the very large captured English prize the &quot;Christopher&quot;. This was a normal medieval tactic for a fleet fighting on the defensive. Barbavera, the experienced commander of the galleys, was concerned about this, realising they would lack manoeuvrability in their anchorage and be open to attack from the ship-based English archers. He advised the French commanders to put to sea and gain the weather gage, so as to be able to attack the English while they were disembarking, or deter this by the threat of an attack. Béhuchet, who as constable exercised overall command, knew little of naval operations. He viewed Barbavera as a mere commoner and near pirate, and wishing to take no chances of the English slipping past, insisted on holding a position blocking the inlet.

==Battle==
Cobham reported back late that night on the state of the French fleet. Edward entered the roadstead at high tide the next day, 24 June, manoeuvring to be able to attack with the advantage of wind and tide and with the sun behind them. The traditional view is that the attack took place at 3:00 pm. After nearly a day linked by chains and ropes, and with wind and rain working against them, the French ships had been driven to the east of their starting positions and become entangled with each other. Béhuchet and Quiéret ordered the ships to be separated, although in the event this proved difficult, and the fleet attempted to move back to the west, against the wind and the tide. In this disorganised state they made contact with the English.

Edward sent his ships against the French fleet in units of three, two ships carrying archers flanking one with men-at-arms. The English ships with the archers would approach a French ship and loose arrows at a rate of more than ten per minute from each archer onto its decks; the men-at-arms would then board and take the vessel. The modern historians Jonathan Sumption and Robert Hardy separately state that the English archers, with their longbows, had a rate of fire two or three times greater than the French crossbowmen and significantly outranged them: Hardy reckons the longbows had an effective range of compared with for the crossbows.

The battle resembled a land engagement at sea. Two opposing ships would be lashed together and the men-at-arms would then engage in hand-to-hand fighting while supporting troops shot arrows or bolts. As the battle progressed Béhuchet&#x27;s tactic of chaining his ships together proved disastrous for the French, as it allowed the English to attack single ships or small groups of ships with overwhelming force while the rest of the French were immobilised. The greater number of fighting men in the English ships, especially archers, also told. A London longbowman reported that the English arrows were &quot;like hail in winter&quot;. Many French ships were boarded and captured after fierce fighting. Barbavera had refused to tie his highly manoeuvrable galleys in with the French ships and they managed to board and capture two English ships. Several English noblewomen were killed when their ship was either boarded or sunk. As it became clear that the battle was going the way of the English, their Flemish allies sallied from the nearby ports and fell upon the French rear. In a letter to his son, Edward said the French &quot;made a most noble defence all that day and the night after&quot;.

Late at night the French rear line attempted to break out. Apart from the galleys only 17 other French ships escaped. The English captured 166 French merchant ships. The remaining 24 ships of the French fleet were sunk or burnt. Few, if any, prisoners were taken and the water was thick with blood and corpses. French losses were between 16,000 and 20,000 killed, a high proportion of these by drowning. The two French commanders were both captured and Béhuchet was hanged from the mast of his own ship, while Quiéret was beheaded, in vengeance for the massacre they had overseen at Arnemuiden two years earlier and for their raids on the English coast. Frenchmen who managed to swim ashore were clubbed to death by Flemish spectators. Only four English knights were killed, along with a larger number of other English combatants; chroniclers of the time estimated 400–600. The English joked that if the fish in Sluys harbour could speak, it would be in French, from the feast of French bodies they had dined on. For days the tides washed up bodies. Edward was wounded in the thigh by either an arrow or a crossbow bolt. Sumption summarises: &quot;The French had suffered a naval catastrophe on a scale unequalled until modern times&quot;.

==Aftermath==

Tactically the battle allowed Edward to land his army, which went on to besiege Tournai, a city in Flanders loyal to Philip VI, although the campaign ended in failure. In the aftermath of the battle, the French suffered an invasion scare and rushed troops to their coastal districts. Philip ordered that Barbavera be arrested for desertion. Strategically the victory had little effect. It gave the English fleet naval supremacy in the English Channel, but Philip had greater resources than Edward and was able to rapidly rebuild the French navy around the ships which had escaped and those which were not involved in the battle. Within a month a French squadron under their new admiral, Robert de Houdetot, captured 30 merchantmen from an English wool convoy and threw the crews overboard. French ships continued to capture English merchantmen in the North Sea and to run men and munitions to their allies, the Scots. Nevertheless, the naval historian Graham Cushway says the loss of mariners economically devastated Norman and Picard maritime trade. An almshouse was set up at Leure (near Harfleur) to care for survivors too injured to work as seamen.

English coastal communities rejoiced in the victory and in the relief from French raids they supposed it brought. They were mistaken; later in the year the French raided the Isle of Wight, Portland, Teignmouth, Plymouth and the Channel Islands. The English retaliated in September by raiding Brest, capturing many ships, including six fully laden Genoese merchantmen. In 1341 French, Castilian and Portuguese squadrons successfully interdicted English communications with Gascony. Edward made some efforts to remove a few of his more corrupt officials, and revoked some privileges of some of the ports which had failed to supply ships.

The battle was later commemorated on Edward&#x27;s gold noble coin, which depicted the King seated in a ship. The inscription reads: IHC TRANSIENS PER MEDIUM ILLORUM IBAT (&quot;Jesus passing through the midst of them went his way&quot;), an antiphon based on the Gospel of Luke 4:30, a text which was commonly invoked at the time for protection against harm in battle.

<text>The national flag of Greece, popularly referred to as the Blue-and-White (, ) or the Cyan-and-White (, ), is officially recognised by Greece as one of its national symbols and has 5 equal horizontal stripes of blue alternating with white. There is a blue canton in the upper hoist-side corner bearing a white cross; the cross symbolises Eastern Orthodox Christianity. The blazon of the flag is azure, four bars argent; on a canton of the field a Greek cross throughout of the second. The official flag ratio is 2:3. The shade of blue used in the flag has varied throughout its history, from light blue to dark blue, the latter being increasingly used since the late 1960s. It was officially adopted by the First National Assembly at Epidaurus on 13 January 1822.

While the nine stripes do not have any official meaning, the most popular interpretation says that they represent the syllables of the phrase (&#x27;Freedom or Death&#x27;): the five blue stripes for the syllables in , the four white for those of . White and blue symbolise the colours of the Greek sky and sea.

==Historical background==

It has been suggested by historians that the current flag derived from an older design, the virtually identical flag of the powerful Cretan Kallergis family. This flag was based on their coat of arms, whose pattern is supposed to be derived from the standards of their claimed ancestor, Byzantine Emperor Nicephorus II Phocas (963–969 AD). This pattern (according to not easily verifiable descriptions) included nine stripes of alternating blue and white, as well as a cross, assumed to be placed on the upper left. Although the use of alternating blue and white - or silver - stripes on (several centuries-old) Kallergis&#x27; coats of arms is well documented, no depiction of the above described pattern (with the nine stripes and the cross) survives.

===Antiquity and the Byzantine Empire===
The Byzantines, like the Romans before them, used a variety of flags and banners, primarily to denote different military units. These were generally square or rectangular, with a number of streamers attached. Most prominent among the early Byzantine flags was the . In the surviving pictorial sources of the middle and later Empire, primarily the illustrated Skylitzes Chronicle, the predominating colours are red and blue in horizontal stripes, with a cross often placed in the centre of the flag. Other common symbols, prominently featuring on seals, were depictions of Christ, the Virgin Mary and saints, but these represent personal rather than family or state symbols. Western European-style heraldry was largely unknown until the last centuries of the Empire.

There is no mention of any &quot;state&quot; flag until the mid-14th century, when a Spanish atlas, the &quot;Conosçimiento de todos los reynos&quot; depicts the flag of &quot;the Empire of Constantinople&quot; combining the red-on-white Cross of St George with the &quot;tetragrammatic cross&quot; of the ruling house of the Palaiologoi, featuring the four betas or &quot;pyrekvola&quot; (&quot;fire-steels&quot;) on the flag quarters representing the imperial motto (&quot;King of Kings Reigning over those who Rule&quot;). The tetragrammatic cross flag, as it appears in quarters II and III in this design, is well documented. In the same Spanish atlas this &quot;plain&quot; tetragrammatic cross flag is presented as (among other places in the Empire) &quot;the Flag of Salonika&quot; and &quot;the real Greece and Empire of the Greeks (la vera Grecia e el imperio de los griegos)&quot;. The (quartered) arrangement that includes the Cross of St. George is documented only in the Spanish atlas, and most probably combines the arms of Genoa (which had occupied Galata) with those of the Byzantine Empire, and was most probably flown only in Constantinople. Pseudo-Kodinos records the use of the &quot;tetragrammatic cross&quot; on the banner (&quot;phlamoulon&quot;) borne by imperial naval vessels, while the &quot;megas doux&quot; displayed an image of the emperor on horseback.

===Ottoman period===
During the Ottoman rule several unofficial flags were used by Greeks, usually employing the Byzantine double-headed eagle (see below), the cross, depictions of saints and various mottoes.

A military leader, Yiannis Stathas, used a flag with white cross on blue on his ship since 1800. The first flag featuring the design eventually adopted was created and hoisted in the Evangelistria monastery in Skiathos in 1807. Several prominent military leaders (including Theodoros Kolokotronis and Andreas Miaoulis) had gathered there for consultation concerning an uprising, and they were sworn to this flag by the local bishop.
===War of Independence===
===Revolutionary flags===

===Adoption===
European monarchies, aligned in the so-called &quot;Concert of Europe&quot;, were suspicious towards national or social revolutionary movements such as the &quot;Etaireia&quot;. The First Greek National Assembly, convening in January 1822, thus took steps to disassociate itself from the &quot;Etaireia&quot;″s legacy and portray nascent Greece as a &quot;conventional&quot;, ordered nation-state. As such, not only were the regional councils abolished in favour of a central administration, but it was decided to abolish all revolutionary flags and adopt a universal national flag. The reasons why the particular arrangement (white cross on blue) was selected, instead of the more popular blue cross on a white field, remain unknown.

On 15 March 1822, the Provisional Government, by Decree Nr. 540, laid down the exact pattern: white cross on blue (plain) for the land flag; nine alternate-coloured stripes with the white cross on a blue field in the canton for the naval ensign; and blue with a blue cross on a white field in the canton for the civil ensign (merchant flag). On 30 June 1828, by decree of the Governor Ioannis Kapodistrias, the civil ensign was discontinued, and the cross-and-stripes naval ensign became the national ensign, worn by both naval and merchant ships.

On 7 February 1828 the Greek flag was internationally recognised for the first time by receiving an official salutation from British, French, and Russian forces in Nafplio, then the capital of Greece.

===Historical evolution===
After the establishment of the Kingdom of Greece in 1832, the new king, Otto, added the royal coat of arms (a shield in his ancestral Bavarian pattern topped by a crown) in the centre of the cross for military flags (both land and sea versions). The decree dated 4 (16) April 1833 provided for various maritime flags such as the war flag or naval ensign (set at 18:25), pennant, royal standard (set at 7:10) and civil ensign (i.e. the naval ensign without coat of arms).

In 1863, the 17-year old Danish prince William was selected as Greece&#x27;s new king, taking on the name George I. A royal decree dated 28 December 1863 introduced crowns into the various flags in place of the coat of arms. Similar arrangements were made for the royal flags, which featured the coat of arms of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg on a square version of the national flag. A square version of the land flag with St. George in the centre was adopted on 9 April 1864 as the Army&#x27;s colours. The exact shape and usage of the flags was determined by Royal Decree on 26 September 1867. By a new Royal Decree, on 31 May 1914, the various flags of Greece and its military were further regulated. By this decree, the flag with the crown was adopted for use as a state flag by ministries, embassies and civil services, while the sea flag (without the crown) was allowed for use by private citizens.

On 25 March 1924, with the establishment of the Second Hellenic Republic, the crowns were removed from all flags. On 20 February 1930, the national flag&#x27;s proportions were established at a 2:3 ratio, with the arms of the cross being &quot;one fifth of the flag&#x27;s width&quot;. The land version of the national flag was to be used by ministries, embassies, and in general by all civil and military services, while the sea flag was to be used by naval and merchant vessels, consulates and private citizens. On 10 October 1935, Georgios Kondylis declared that the monarchy had been restored. By decree of 7 November 1935, the 31 May 1914 decree was restored.

==== Military dictatorship (1967–1974) ====
The legal provisions went unaltered for a relatively long period of time. In 1967, a new Compulsory Law (198) regulated the declaration of regional flag days, but did not alter the flag. However, on August 18, 1969, the sea flag was established as the sole national flag and on August 18, 1970, the flag ratio was changed to 7:12 from 2:3. Flags flying in ministries, embassies and public buildings had the crown in the centre of the cross until the official abolition of the monarchy on 1 June 1973 and the use of the crown was officially discontinued on July 16.

After the restoration of democracy, Law 48/1975 and Presidential Decree 515/1975, which entered into effect on 7 June 1975, reversed the situation and designated the former &quot;land flag&quot; as the sole flag of Greece, to be used even at sea. The situation was once again reversed in 1978, when the sea flag once again became the sole flag of Greece and all previous provisions were abolished.
=== Theories regarding the blue and white colours ===

Several Greek researchers have attempted to establish a continuity of usage and significance of the blue and white colours, throughout Greek history.

Usages cited include the pattern of blue and white formations included on the shield of Achilles, the apparent connection of blue with goddess Athena, some of Alexander the Great&#x27;s army banners, possible blue and white flags used during Byzantine times, supposed coats of arms of imperial dynasties and noble families, uniforms, emperors&#x27; clothes, patriarchs&#x27; thrones etc., 15th century versions of the Byzantine Imperial Emblems and, of course, cases of usage during the Ottoman rule and the Greek revolution. 

A number of sources describe, since at least 1810 and through the revolution, a flag consisting of eight horizontal alternating blue and white stripes used by Greeks as a sea flag, suggesting a connection with the original naval flag.

On the other hand, the Great Greek Encyclopedia notes in its 1934 entry on the Greek flag that &quot;very many things have been said for the causes which lead to this specification for the Greek flag, but without historical merit&quot;.

==Current flag of Greece==

In 1978, the sea flag was adopted as the sole national flag, with a 2:3 ratio.

===Protocol===

The use of the Greek flag is regulated by Law 851. More specifically, the law states that:
*When displayed at the Presidential Palace, the Hellenic Parliament, the ministries, embassies and consulates of Greece, schools, military camps, and public and private ships as well as the navy, the flag must:
:#Fly from 8am until sunset,
:#Be displayed on a white mast topped with a white cross on top of a white sphere,
:#Not be torn or damaged in any way. If the flag is damaged, it should be burned in a respectful manner.
*The flag can be displayed by civilians on days specified by the ministry of internal affairs, as well as in sporting events and other occasions of the sort.
*When displayed vertically, the canton must be on the left side of the flag from the point of view of the spectator.
*The flag should never be:
:#Defaced by means of writing or superimposing any kind of image or symbol upon it,
:#Used to cover a statue. In that case, cloth in the national colours must be used,
:#Hung from windows or balconies without the use of a mast,
:#Used for commercial purposes,
:#Used as a logo for any corporation or organization, even at different proportions.
*When placed on top of a coffin, the canton must always be on the right of the person&#x27;s head.

===Colours===
The government has not specified exactly &quot;which&quot; shade of blue should be used for the flag, and as such flags with many varying shades exist. In the most recent legislation regarding the national flag, the colours mentioned are:
Because of the use of the word &#x27;cyan&#x27; (, ), which can also mean &#x27;blue&#x27; in Greek, the exact shade of blue remains ambiguous. Although it implies the use of a light shade of blue, such as on the flag of the United Nations, the colours of the Greek flag tend to be darker, especially during the dictatorship and in recent years, with the exception of the years of the rule of King Otto, when a very light shade of blue was used. Consequently, the shade of blue is largely left to the flagmakers to decide, as shown in the table below. 
===Flag days===

Law 851/1978 sets the general outline for when the specific days on which the flag should be raised. For national holidays, this applies country-wide, but on local ones it only applies to those areas where the said holiday is being celebrated. Additionally, the flag may also be flown on days of national mourning, half-mast. The Minister of the Interior has the authority to proclaim flag days if they are not already proclaimed, and proclaiming regional flag days is vested with the elected head of each regional unit (formerly prefectures).

Although 17 November is not an official national holiday, Presidential Decree 201/1998 states that respects are to be paid to the flag on that particular day.

=== Usage in the Republic of Cyprus ===
According to the Constitution of Cyprus, the community authorities and their institutions have the right to hoist the Greek flag (as well as the Turkish flag) alongside the flag of Cyprus during the holidays. Any citizen may, without any restriction, fly the Greek or Turkish flag, or both, next to the flag of Cyprus.

==Military flags==

=== Army and Air Force War flag ===
The war flag (equivalent to regimental colours) of the Army and the Air Force is of square shape, with a white cross on blue background. On the centre of the cross the image of Saint George is shown on Army war flags and the image of archangel Michael is shown on Air Force war flags.

In the Army war flags are normally carried by infantry, tank and special forces regiments and battalions, by the Evelpidon Military Academy, the Non-Commissioned Officers Academy and the Presidential Guard when in battle or in parade.

===Naval and civil ensigns===
The current naval and civil ensigns are identical to the national flag.

The simple &quot;white cross on blue field&quot; pattern is also used as the Navy&#x27;s jack and as the base pattern for naval rank flags. These flags are described in Chapter 21 (articles 2101–30) of the Naval Regulations. A jack is also flown by larger vessels of the Hellenic Coast Guard.

Units of Naval or Coast Guard personnel in parade fly the war ensign in place of the war flag.

===Other uniformed services===
In the past a war flag was assigned to the former semi-military Hellenic Gendarmerie, which was later merged with Cities Police to form the current Hellenic Police. The flag was similar to the Army war flag but showing Saint Irene in place of Saint George.

Since the Fire Service and the Hellenic Police are considered civilian agencies, they are not assigned war flags. They use the National Flag instead. Identical rules were applied to the former Cities Police. However, recently the Police Academy has been assigned a war flag, and they paraded for the first time with this flag on Independence Day, March 25, 2011. The flag is similar to the Army war flag, with the image of St George replaced with that of Artemius of Antioch.

==Flag of the head of state==
The president&#x27;s flag is currently prescribed by Presidential Decree 274/1979.

==Use of double-headed eagle==

One of the most recognisable and beloved Greek symbols, the double-headed eagle, is not a part of the modern Greek flag or coat of arms (although it is officially used by the Greek Army, the Church of Greece, the Cypriot National Guard and the Church of Cyprus, and was incorporated in the Greek coat of arms in 1926).

<text>The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews and of his Friend Mr. Abraham Adams, was the first full-length novel by the English author Henry Fielding to be published and among the early novels in the English language. Appearing in 1742 and defined by Fielding as a &quot;comic epic poem in prose&quot;, it tells of a good-natured footman&#x27;s adventures on the road home from London with his friend and mentor, the absent-minded parson Abraham Adams.

==Inspirations==
The novel embodies a fusion of two competing aesthetics of 18th-century literature: the mock-heroic and neoclassical (and, by extension, aristocratic) approach of Augustans such as Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift, and the popular, domestic prose fiction of novelists such as Daniel Defoe and Samuel Richardson.

The novel draws on various inspirations. Written &quot;in imitation of the manner of Cervantes, the author of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;&quot; (see title page on right), the work owes much of its humour to the techniques developed by Cervantes, and its subject-matter to the seemingly loose arrangement of events, digressions and lower-class characters to the genre of writing known as picaresque. In deference to the literary tastes and recurring tropes of the period, it relies on bawdy humour, an impending marriage and a mystery surrounding unknown parentage, but conversely is rich in philosophical digressions, classical erudition and social purpose.

==Background==
Fielding&#x27;s first venture into prose fiction came a year previously with the publication in pamphlet form of &quot;Shamela&quot;, a travesty of the stylistic failings and moral hypocrisy that Fielding saw in Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Pamela&quot; and a direct response to them. Richardson&#x27;s epistolary tale of a resolute servant girl, armed only with her &quot;virtue&quot;, battling against her master&#x27;s attempts at seduction had become an overnight literary sensation in 1741. The implicit moral message—that a girl&#x27;s chastity has eventual value as a commodity—and the awkwardness of the epistolary form in dealing with ongoing events, along with the triviality of the detail which the form necessitates, were some of the main targets of Fielding&#x27;s parody.

Richardson would continue to be a target of Fielding&#x27;s first novel, but the &quot;Pamela&quot; phenomenon was just one example of what he saw as a culture of literary abuses in the mid-18th century. Colley Cibber, poet laureate and mock-hero of Pope&#x27;s &quot;Dunciad&quot;, is identified in the first chapter of the novel as another offender against propriety, morality and literary value.

The impetus for the novel, as Fielding claims in the preface, is the establishment of a genre of writing &quot;which I do not remember to have been hitherto attempted in our language&quot;, defined as the &quot;comic epic-poem in prose&quot;: a work of prose fiction, epic in length and variety of incident and character, in the hypothetical spirit of Homer&#x27;s lost (and possibly apocryphal) comic poem &quot;Margites&quot;. He dissociates his fiction from the scandal-memoir and the contemporary novel. Book III describes the work as biography.

As becomes apparent from the first few chapters of the novel, in which Richardson and Cibber are parodied mercilessly, the real germ of &quot;Joseph Andrews&quot; is Fielding&#x27;s objection to the moral and technical limitations of the popular literature of his day. But while &quot;Shamela&quot; started and finished as a sustained subversion of a rival work, in &quot;Joseph Andrews&quot; Fielding merely uses the perceived deprivation of popular literature as a springboard to conceive more fully his own philosophy of prose fiction.

==Plot summary==
===Book I===
The novel begins with the affable, intrusive narrator outlining the nature of our hero. Joseph Andrews is the brother of Richardson&#x27;s Pamela and is of the same rustic parentage and patchy ancestry. At the age of 10, he found himself tending animals as an apprentice to Sir Thomas Booby. In proving his worth as a horseman, he caught the eye of Sir Thomas&#x27;s wife, Lady Booby, who now employs him (age 17) as her footman.

After Sir Thomas&#x27;s death, Joseph finds his Lady&#x27;s affections redoubled as she offers herself to him in her chamber while on a trip to London. In a scene analogous to many of Pamela&#x27;s refusals of Mr. B in Richardson&#x27;s novel, Lady Booby finds Joseph&#x27;s Christian commitment to pre-marital chastity unwavering. After suffering the Lady&#x27;s fury, Joseph sends a letter to his sister much like Pamela&#x27;s anguished missives in her own novel. The Lady makes one last attempt at seduction before dismissing him from both his job and his lodgings.

As Joseph sets out from London by moonlight, the narrator introduces the novel&#x27;s heroine, Fanny Goodwill, Joseph&#x27;s true love. A poor, illiterate girl of &#x27;extraordinary beauty&#x27; (I, xi), now living with a farmer close to Lady Booby&#x27;s parish, she and Joseph had grown ever closer since their childhood, before their local parson and mentor Abraham Adams recommended that they postpone marriage until they have the means to live comfortably.

On his way to see Fanny, Joseph is mugged and laid up in a nearby inn where, by coincidence, he is reunited with Parson Adams, who is on his way to London to sell three volumes of his sermons. The thief is found and brought to the inn (only to escape later that night), and Joseph is reunited with his possessions. Adams and Joseph catch up with each other, and the parson, in spite of his own poverty, offers his last 9s 3½d to Joseph&#x27;s disposal.

Joseph and Adams&#x27;s stay in the inn is capped by one of many burlesque, slapstick digressions in the novel. Betty, the inn&#x27;s 21-year-old chambermaid, had taken a liking to Joseph, but is doomed to disappointment by Joseph&#x27;s constancy to Fanny. The landlord, Mr. Tow-wouse, who had always admired Betty, saw this disappointment as an opportunity to take advantage. Locked in an embrace, they are discovered by the choleric Mrs. Tow-wouse, who chases the maid through the house until Adams restrains her. With the landlord promising not to transgress again, his lady allows him to make his peace at the cost of &quot;quietly and contentedly bearing to be reminded of his transgressions, as a kind of penance, once or twice a day, during the residue of his life&quot; (I, xviii).

===Book II===
During his stay in the inn, Adams&#x27;s hopes for his sermons are mocked in a discussion with a travelling bookseller and another parson. Nevertheless, Adams remains resolved to continue his journey to London until it is revealed that his wife, deciding that he would be more in need of shirts than sermons on his journey, has neglected to pack them. The pair thus decide to return to the parson&#x27;s parish: Joseph in search of Fanny, and Adams in search of his sermons.

With Joseph following on horseback, Adams finds himself sharing a stage coach with an anonymous lady and Madam Slipslop, an admirer of Joseph&#x27;s and a servant of Lady Booby. When they pass the house of a teenage girl named Leonora, the anonymous lady is reminded of a story and begins one of the novel&#x27;s three interpolated tales, &quot;The History of Leonora, or the Unfortunate Jilt&quot;. This continues for a number of chapters, punctuated by the questions and interruptions of the other passengers.

After stopping at an inn, Adams relinquishes his seat to Joseph, and forgetting his horse, sets out ahead on foot. Finding himself some time ahead of his friend, Adams rests by the side of the road where he becomes so engaged in conversation with a fellow traveller that he misses the stage coach as it passes. As the night falls and Adams and the stranger discourse on courage and duty, a shriek is heard. The stranger, having seconds earlier lauded the virtues of bravery and chivalry, makes his excuses and flees the scene without turning back. Adams, however, rushes to the girl&#x27;s aid and after a mock-epic struggle knocks her attacker unconscious. In spite of Adams&#x27;s good intentions, he and the girl, who reveals herself to be none other than Fanny Goodwill (in search of Joseph after hearing of his mugging), find themselves accused of assault and robbery.

After some comic litigious wrangling before the local magistrate, the pair are eventually released and depart shortly after midnight in search of Joseph. They do not have to walk far before a storm forces them into the same inn that Joseph and Slipslop have chosen for the night. Slipslop, her jealousy ignited by seeing the two lovers reunited, departs angrily. When Adams, Joseph and Fanny come to leave the following morning, they find their departure delayed by an inability to settle the bill, and, with Adams&#x27;s solicitations of a loan from the local parson and his wealthy parishioners failing, it falls on a local peddler to rescue the trio by loaning them his last 6s 6d.

The solicitations of charity that Adams is forced to make, and the complications which surround their stay in the parish, bring him into contact with many local squires, gentlemen and parsons, and much of the latter part of Book II is taken up by discussions of literature, religion, philosophy and trade that result.

===Book III===
The three depart the inn by night, and it is not long before Fanny needs to rest. With the party silent, they overhear approaching voices agree on &quot;the murder of any one they meet&quot; (III, ii) and flee to a local house. Inviting them in, the owner, Mr. Wilson, informs them that the gang of supposed murderers were in fact sheep-stealers, intent more on the killing of livestock than of Adams and his friends. The party being settled, Wilson begins the novel&#x27;s most lengthy interpolated tale by recounting his life story; a story which bears a notable resemblance to Fielding&#x27;s own youth.
At the age of 16, Wilson&#x27;s father died and left him a modest fortune. Finding himself the master of his destiny, he left school and travelled to London where he soon acquainted himself with the dress, manners and reputation for womanising necessary to consider himself a &quot;beau&quot;. Wilson&#x27;s life in the town is a façade: he writes love-letters to himself, obtains his fine clothes on credit, and is concerned more to be seen at the theatre than to watch the play. After two bad experiences with women, he is financially crippled, and much like Fielding, falls into the company of a group of Deists, freethinkers and gamblers. Finding himself in debt, he, like Fielding, turns to the writing of plays and hack journalism to alleviate his financial problems. He spends his last few pence on a lottery ticket, but with no reliable income, is soon forced to exchange it for food. While in jail for his debts, news reaches him that the ticket he gave away has won a £3,000 prize. His disappointment is short-lived, however, as the daughter of the winner hears of his plight, pays off his debts, and, after a brief courtship, agrees to marry him.

Wilson found himself at the mercy of many of the social ills that Fielding had written about in his journalism: the over-saturated and abused literary market, the exploitative state lottery, and regressive laws which sanctioned imprisonment for small debts. Having seen the corrupting influence of wealth and the town, he retires with his new wife to the rural solitude in which Adams, Fanny and Joseph find them. The only break in his contentment, and one which turns out to be significant to the plot, was the kidnapping of his eldest son, whom he has not seen since.

Wilson promises to visit Adams when he passes through his parish, and after another mock-epic battle on the road, this time with a party of hunting dogs, the trio proceed to the house of a local squire, where Fielding illustrates another contemporary social ill by having Adams subjected to a humiliating roasting. Enraged, the three depart to the nearest inn to find that, while at the squire&#x27;s house, they had been robbed of their last half-guinea. To compound their misery, the squire has Adams and Joseph accused of kidnapping Fanny, to have them detained while he orders the abduction of the girl himself. She is rescued in transit, however, by Lady Booby&#x27;s steward, Peter Pounce, and all four of them complete the remainder of the journey to Booby Hall together.

===Book IV===
On seeing Joseph arrive back in the parish, a jealous Lady Booby meanders through emotions as diverse as rage, pity, hatred, pride and love. The next morning Joseph and Fanny&#x27;s banns are published and the Lady turns her anger onto Parson Adams, who is accommodating Fanny at his house. Finding herself powerless either to stop the marriage or to expel them from the parish, she enlists the help of Lawyer Scout, who brings a spurious charge of larceny against Joseph and Fanny to prevent, or at least postpone the wedding.

Three days later, the Lady&#x27;s plans are foiled by the visit of her nephew, Mr Booby, and a surprise guest: Booby has married Pamela, granting Joseph a powerful new ally and brother-in-law. What is more, Booby is an acquaintance of the justice presiding over Joseph and Fanny&#x27;s trial, and instead of Bridewell, has them committed to his own custody. Knowing of his sister&#x27;s antipathy to the two lovers, Booby offers to reunite Joseph with his sister and take him and Fanny into his own parish and his own family.

In a discourse with Joseph on stoicism and fatalism, Adams instructs his friend to submit to the will of God and control his passions, even in the face of overwhelming tragedy. In the kind of cruel juxtaposition usually reserved for Fielding&#x27;s less savoury characters, Adams is informed that his youngest son, Jacky, has drowned. After indulging his grief in a manner contrary to his lecture a few minutes previously, Adams is informed that the report was premature, and that his son has in fact been rescued by the same peddler that loaned him his last few shillings in Book II.

Lady Booby, in a last-ditch attempt to sabotage the marriage, brings a young beau named Didapper to Adams&#x27;s house to seduce Fanny. Fanny is unmoved by his bold attempts at courtship. Didapper is too bold in his approach and provokes Joseph into a fight. The Lady and the beau depart in disgust, but the peddler, having seen the Lady, is compelled to relate a tale. The peddler had met his wife while in the army, and she died young. While on her death bed, she confessed that she once stole an exquisitely beautiful baby girl from a family named Andrews, and sold her on to Sir Thomas Booby, thus raising the possibility that Fanny may in fact be Joseph&#x27;s sister. The company is shocked, but there is general relief that the crime of incest may have been narrowly averted.

The following morning, Joseph and Pamela&#x27;s parents arrive, and together with the peddler and Adams, they piece together the question of Fanny&#x27;s parentage. The Andrews identify her as their lost daughter, but have a twist to add to the tale. When Fanny was an infant, she was indeed stolen from her parents, but the thieves left behind a sickly infant Joseph in return, who was raised as their own. It is immediately apparent that Joseph is the above-mentioned kidnapped son of Wilson, and when Wilson arrives on his promised visit, he identifies Joseph by a birthmark on his chest. Joseph is now the son of a respected gentleman, Fanny an in-law of the Booby family, and the couple no longer suspected of being siblings. Two days later they are married by Adams in a humble ceremony, and the narrator, after bringing the story to a close, and in a disparaging allusion to Richardson, reassures readers that there will be no sequel.

==Stage adaptation==
&quot;Joseph Andrews&quot;, a stage adaptation of the first and fourth books of the novel, was written by Samuel Jackson Pratt and performed on 20 April 1778 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. The role of Fanny was played by Mary Robinson.

==Film adaptation==
The novel was adapted for the screen in 1977 by Tony Richardson, Allan Scott and Chris Bryant. Richardson directed the critically well-received work, with Michael Hordern as Adams, Peter Firth as Joseph, and Lady Booby played by Swedish-born Ann-Margret, who received a Golden Globe nomination for the role. The tag line (&quot;The story of a young, English footman who served the Lady Booby but loved the little Fanny&quot;) suggests how it captures some of the source material&#x27;s bawdy humour. It was released on region 1 DVD in 2003.

==Radio adaptations==
A four-part radio adaption dramatised by John Scotney was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in April 1986.

A two-part adaptation, &quot;Joseph Andrews Remixed&quot;, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in July 2021. It was written by Shaun McKenna and incorporated a fictionalization of Fielding writing the novel with the help of his wife whilst the couple struggled for money in fear of retribution for some of Fielding&#x27;s anonymous satires against the Tory government.

<text>Precious Bunny (May 6, 1988 - April 15, 2015) is a bay Standardbred pacer and sire.

==Background==
Precious Bunny is a bay horse bred in Cranbury, New Jersey. He was sired by Cam Fella who won the Cane Pace and Messenger Stakes in 1982. His dam Bunny&#x27;s Wish was a daughter of B Gs Bunny. He was trained to be a harness racer. He was trained by Bill Robinson and usually driven by Jack Moiseyev.

==Racing career==
In 1990, Precious Bunny ran fourteen times, recording his only success in a New Jersey Sire Stakes.

As a three-year-old in 1991 Precious Bunny won twenty of his twenty-five races. In June, he won the $1 million North America Cup at Greenwood Raceway in June. In the following month he was matched against Artsplace, the leading two-year-old pacer of 1990 in the $1 million Meadowlands Pace at Meadowlands Racetrack. Starting second in the betting, Precious Bunny overtook Artsplace on the backstretch and drew away in the straight to win by two lengths in a time of 1:49.4, one of the fastest times ever recorded in harness racing. He later won the Art Rooney Pace and the Adios Pace.

On September 19 the colt started favorite for the Little Brown Jug at Delaware, Ohio. Racing in front of a record crowd of 52,967 Precious Bunny won his heat in 1:54.1, before winning the final in 1:55.0, beating Nuke Skywalker by three quarters of a length. After the race, Moiseyev said &quot;This is the first time I really started him up that fast. He felt good... He&#x27;s done everything we have asked him to do and he proved himself today&quot;.

In the Autumn of 1991, Precious Bunny added victories in the Cleveland Classic, NJSS final and Windy City Pace.

==Stud record==
Precious Bunny was retired to stud at Hickory Lane Horse Farm in Findlay, Ohio. He was exported to New Zealand in 2000. He is the sire of Bunny Lake – the United States Harness Horse of the Year in 2001, Precious Delight, Stout, Bunny&#x27;s Express Lane, and PB Bullville, who set a record for three-year old pacers of 1:48 for the mile.

==Honors==
Precious Bunny was voted Harness Horse of the Year in 1991. He was elected to the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 2004, and the United States Harness Racing Hall of Fame in 2014.

==Pedigree==
*Precious Bunny was inbred 3 x 4 to Meadow Skipper and Bret Hanover, meaning that these stallions appear in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

<text>François Jacob (; 17 June 1920 – 19 April 2013) was a French biologist who, together with Jacques Monod, originated the idea that control of enzyme levels in all cells occurs through regulation of transcription. He shared the 1965 Nobel Prize in Medicine with Jacques Monod and André Lwoff.

==Early years==
Jacob was born the only child of Simon, a merchant, and Thérèse (Franck) Jacob, in Nancy, France. An inquisitive child, he learned to read at a young age. Albert Franck, Jacob&#x27;s maternal grandfather, a four-star general, was Jacob&#x27;s childhood role model. At seven he entered the Lycée Carnot, where he was schooled for the next ten years; in his autobiography, he describes his impression of it: &quot;a cage&quot;. He was antagonized by rightist youth at the Lycée Carnot around 1934. He describes his father as a &quot;conformist in religion&quot;, while his mother and other family members important in his childhood were secular Jews; shortly after his bar mitzvah, he became an atheist.

Though interested (and talented) in physics and mathematics, Jacob was horrified at the prospect of spending two additional years in &quot;an even more draconian regime&quot; to prepare for higher study at the Polytechnique. Instead, after observing a surgical operation that cemented his &quot;slight interest&quot; in medicine, he entered medical school.

During the German occupation of France—and on the heels of his mother&#x27;s death—Jacob left France for Great Britain to join the war effort. Jacob, who had only completed his second year of medical studies, joined the medical company of the French 2nd Armored Division in 1940. He was injured in a German air attack in 1944 and returned to now-liberated Paris on 1 August 1944. For his wartime service, he was awarded France&#x27;s WWII highest decoration for valor, the Cross of Liberation, as well as Légion d&#x27;honneur and croix de guerre.

After his recovery, Jacob returned to medical school and began researching tyrothricin and learning the methods of bacteriology in the process. He completed a thesis he described as &quot;replicating American work&quot; on the effectiveness of the antibiotic against local infections, and became a medical doctor in 1947. Though attracted to research as a career, he was discouraged by his own perceived ignorance after attending a microbiology congress that summer. Instead, he took a position at the Cabanel Center, where he had done his thesis research; his new work entailed the manufacture of an antibiotic, tyrothricin. Later, the center was contracted to convert gunpowder factories for penicillin production (though this proved impossible).

Also in this period, he met and began courting his future wife, Lise Bloch. Jacob remarried in 1999 to Geneviève Barrier.

==Research==

In 1961 Jacob and Monod explored the idea that the control of enzyme expression levels in cells is a result of regulation of transcription of DNA sequences. Their experiments and ideas gave impetus to the emerging field of molecular developmental biology, and of transcriptional regulation in particular.

For many years it had been known that bacterial and other cells could respond to external conditions by regulating levels of their key metabolic enzymes, and/or the activity of these enzymes. For instance, if a bacterium finds itself in a broth containing lactose, rather than the simpler sugar glucose, it must adapt itself to the need to 1) import lactose, 2) cleave lactose to its constituents glucose and galactose, and 3) convert the galactose to glucose. It was known that cells ramp up their production of the enzymes that do these steps when exposed to lactose, rather than wastefully producing these enzymes all the time. Studies of enzyme activity control were progressing through theories of the (allosteric) action of small molecules on the enzyme molecule itself (switching it on or off), but the method of controlling the enzyme production was not well understood at the time.

With the earlier determination of the structure and central importance of DNA, it became clear that all proteins were being produced in some way from its genetic code, and that this step might form a key control point. Jacob and Monod made key experimental and theoretical discoveries that demonstrated that in the case of the lactose system outlined above (in the bacterium &quot;E. coli&quot;), there are specific proteins that are devoted to repressing the transcription of the DNA to its product (RNA, which in turn is decoded into protein).

This repressor (the lac repressor) is made in all cells, binding directly to DNA at the genes it controls, and physically preventing the transcription apparatus from gaining access to the DNA. In the presence of lactose, some of the lactose is converted to allolactose, which binds to the repressor making it no longer able to bind to DNA, and the transcriptional repression is lifted. In this way, a robust feedback loop is constructed that allows the set of lactose-digesting proteins products to be made only when they are needed.

Jacob and Monod extended this repressor model to all genes in all organisms in their initial exuberance. The regulation of gene activity has developed into a very large sub-discipline of molecular biology, and in truth exhibits enormous variety in mechanism and many levels of complexity. Current researchers find regulatory events at every conceivable level of the processes that express genetic information. In the relatively simple genome of baker&#x27;s yeast, (&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;), 405 of its 6,419 protein-encoding genes are directly involved in transcriptional control, compared to 1,938 that are enzymes.

<text>Frances Sheridan (&quot;née&quot; Chamberlaine; 1724 – 26 September 1766) was an Anglo-Irish novelist and playwright.

==Life==
Frances Chamberlaine was born in Dublin, Ireland. Her father, Dr. Phillip Chamberlaine, was an Anglican minister. In 1747 she married Thomas Sheridan, who was then an actor and theatre director, and at the same time she began work on her first novel, &quot;Eugenia and Adelaide&quot;. The couple moved to London permanently in 1758 for business reasons (after an earlier sortie to London in 1754). In London Frances was introduced to Samuel Richardson, who encouraged her in her writing. Her most successful novel, &quot;Memoirs of Miss Sidney Bidulph&quot; (1761), in diary format, was influenced by Samuel Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Pamela&quot;. She then turned to drama, and two of her plays were produced at London&#x27;s Drury Lane theatre by David Garrick&#x27;s company in the 1760s. Frances Sheridan was the mother of Charles Francis Sheridan and the famous playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan; Richard&#x27;s early successful plays were much influenced by his mother&#x27;s plays. Frances and Thomas Sheridan also had another son, Sackville Sheridan, who only lived two months after his birth in 1754. Frances Sheridan&#x27;s daughter, Alicia Sheridan Lefanu (1753–1817), wrote a play, &quot;Sons of Erin&quot;, which was produced in London in 1812. Sheridan&#x27;s second daughter, Anne Elizabeth Sheridan Lefanu (1756–1837) wrote as well, and some of her journals were published in 1960 as &quot;Betsy Sheridan&#x27;s Journal, Letters from Sheridan&#x27;s sister, 1784–1786 and 1788–1790&quot;. Frances Sheridan died at age 42 in Blois, France. Her oriental tale, &quot;The History of Nourjahad&quot;, and her sequel to &quot;The Memoirs of Miss Sidney Biddulph&quot;, were published posthumously.

A book-length biography of Frances Sheridan, &quot;Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Mrs. Frances Sheridan,&quot; was published in 1824, written by her granddaughter, Alicia LeFanu.

<doc id="222981" wikidata="Q180305" url="?curid=222981" title="AS Monaco FC">
<text>Association Sportive de Monaco Football Club, commonly referred to as AS Monaco (), is a professional football club based in Fontvieille, Monaco. Although not in France, they are a member of the French Football Federation (FFF) and currently compete in Ligue 1, the top tier of French football. Founded in 1918, the team play their home matches at the Stade Louis II.
Its training center is situated in neighboring France, in la Turbie.

Despite not being a French club, Monaco are one of the most successful clubs in French football, having won eight league titles, five Coupe de France trophies and one Coupe de la Ligue. The club also played in European football a number of times, and were runners-up in the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1992 and the UEFA Champions League in 2004.

The club&#x27;s traditional colours are red and white, and the club is known as &quot;Les Rouge et Blanc&quot; (). Monaco is a member of the European Club Association. In December 2011, two-thirds of the club was sold to an investment group led by Russian oligarch and billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. With Rybolovlev&#x27;s financial backing, the club quickly returned to Ligue 1 and won the 2016–17 Ligue 1, their first league title in 17 years.

== Status ==
Unlike several other European microstates, Monaco has never organized a domestic league and has never sought separate membership in either UEFA or FIFA. As a result, AS Monaco has no domestic league to play in its home country, resulting in it being expatriated into the French league system. AS Monaco is a full member of said French league pyramid, enabling it to represent France in European competitions. There are several other expatriated football clubs in operation around Europe, although AS Monaco is unique in that it represents a nation not a member of the international organizations. Although Vaduz among other Liechtenstein clubs play in the Swiss league system due to Liechtenstein not having a league, those clubs do have a domestic cup in their home country and qualify for European football that way. Two other microstates in Europe have or had teams playing abroad, Andorra and San Marino, although those clubs are separate from existing domestic league infrastructures.

== History ==

===Early history===
AS Monaco FC was founded on 1 August 1920 through the unification of numerous local clubs based in France and the principality. On 23 August 1924, the multiple sports club of the Association Sportive de Monaco was founded. AS Monaco FC was then absorbed by the latter and became the football section of the enlarged Monegasque sporting club.

The club&#x27;s early years were spent in the amateur regional divisions of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region, rising rapidly between the leagues in the 1920s. In 1933, Monaco were invited by the French Football Federation to turn professional. The Monégasques&#x27; first year of second-division football ended in failure, however, as they were relegated to the amateur leagues the following year. By 1948, Monaco re-acquired its professional status and returned to the French second division; they subsequently consistently finished in its upper echelons, with this sustained effort resulting in promotion to the French first division for the first time in 1953.

===1960–1986: Domestic successes===

In 1960, Monaco coach Lucien Leduc led the club to its first professional trophy, the Coupe de France, beating Saint-Étienne 4–2 in extra time. This initial success was bettered in the following year with the club winning the French Championship for the first time in its history, qualifying for the European Cup. Leduc subsequently led the club to its first League and Cup Double in 1963. Upon Leduc&#x27;s departure in 1963, Monaco endured a barren run, entrenched in the middle half of the league for the best part of the next decade and alternating between the first and second divisions after 1963. In 1975, Jean-Louis Campora, son of former president Charles Campora, became chairman of the club. In his second season, he brought back Leduc, who immediately won the club promotion to the first division and won them the championship the following year in 1978. Leduc subsequently left the club again in 1979, to be succeeded by Lucien Muller and Gérard Banide, both of whom were unable to halt the club&#x27;s decline.

The early 1980s saw a steady stream of successes in national competitions. Monaco won a title almost every other year; the Coupe de France in 1980 and 1985, the French Championship in 1982, was Coupe de France finalist in 1984. In the 1985–86 season, Monaco hammered Bordeaux 9–0, one of the biggest wins in club history.

Disappointingly for Monaco fans, the club could not translate its domestic leadership into European success. Up to this point, Monaco had never passed the first round of any European competition. Monaco lost to Dundee United (1981), CSKA Sofia twice (1982 and 1984) and Universitatea Craiova (1985).

===1990s: Wenger and Tigana===
In 1986, former Ajax manager Ștefan Kovács, who succeeded Rinus Michels and honed his Total Football ideals with the Dutch champions, came out of a three-year &quot;retirement&quot; to manage Monaco, but even he could not bring them success. With the club facing a second barren spell, they signed Arsène Wenger, who had hitherto been relatively unknown, managing Nancy without much success. Wenger&#x27;s reign saw the club enjoy one of its most successful periods, with several inspired signings, including George Weah, Glenn Hoddle, Jürgen Klinsmann, and Youri Djorkaeff. Youth team policies produced future World Cup winners Emmanuel Petit, Lilian Thuram and Thierry Henry. Under Wenger, they won the league in his first season in charge (1988) and the Coupe de France in 1991, with the club consistently competing in the latter stages of the European Cup and regularly challenging for the league title. The club could have had even greater success in this period, as it emerged in 1993 that bitter rivals Marseille had indulged in match-fixing and numerous improprieties, a view that Wenger had long held. In 1994, after being blocked by the Monaco board from opening discussions with German powerhouse Bayern Munich for their vacant managerial post after being shortlisted for the role, Wenger was released from the club, several weeks after the post had already been filled.

After Wenger&#x27;s departure, the club went on to record two further league championships; under Jean Tigana in 1997 and under Claude Puel in 2000. However, as the decade came to an end, rumours were surfacing that the club was facing numerous financial difficulties. In 2003, these financial problems came to a head. Despite finishing second in the league, the club was relegated to Ligue 2 by the French Professional League for amassing a €50 million ($68 million) debt. Whilst this was reduced on appeal to a ban on purchasing players, it was enough to force President Jean-Louis Campora, who had been in charge for 28 years, to step aside. He was replaced by Pierre Svara, an administrator considered to be close to the principality&#x27;s princely family but with no footballing experience.

The following season saw remarkable success on the field, given the club&#x27;s financial strife. The team, coached by former France/ national team captain Didier Deschamps and featuring stalwarts such as Fernando Morientes, Ludovic Giuly, Jérôme Rothen and Dado Pršo, finished third in Ligue 1 and enjoyed a remarkable run to the final of the UEFA Champions League, beating Real Madrid and Chelsea along the way. However, despite the on-field success, the 2003–04 season was the club&#x27;s worst financial year in its history. Within 12 months, Deschamps had left as coach and Svara had been replaced by Michel Pastor.

=== Relegation and takeover ===

With Francesco Guidolin hired to replace Deschamps, one of Pastor&#x27;s first tasks was to hold on to the players who had turned the club into one of the best in Europe. However, he failed to convince them to stay and their replacements were unable to replicate previous successes. Guidolin lasted only one year, before being replaced by assistant coach Laurent Banide who, in turn, only lasted a year, before being replaced by Brazilian Ricardo Gomes. In 2008, after four years at the club featuring six coaches and only mid-table finishes, Pastor left the club amid severe criticism of his management skills.

In 2008, Jérôme de Bontin, a leading shareholder of the club since 2003, took charge of the club, promising a complete shake-up. Under his reign as president, the club brought in players such as Park Chu-young and Freddy Adu, but they did not find much success on the pitch, going through a torrid season and only managing a mid-table finish. De Bontin resigned at the end of the season, replaced by banker Étienne Franzi and a new board of directors.

In July 2009 Ricardo Gomes was replaced by former Cannes and Rennes coach Guy Lacombe, inheriting a youthful squad featuring numerous highly lauded youth team prospects, including Cédric Mongongu, Serge Gakpé, Vincent Muratori, Frédéric Nimani, Nicolas N&#x27;Koulou, Park Chu-young, Yohan Mollo and Yohann Thuram-Ulien. Lacombe led Monaco to eighth place in Ligue 1 in his first season in charge, but he was unable to replicate this performance in his second season and was sacked in January 2011, with Monaco in 17th place in Ligue 1. He was replaced by former coach Laurent Banide, who was unable to turn around the club&#x27;s fortunes; Monaco finished the 2010–11 season in 18th, thus becoming relegated to Ligue 2.

In December 2011, 66.67% of the club was sold to the Russian oligarch and billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev (via a trust under his daughter Ekaterina&#x27;s name) while the club were bottom of Ligue 2. Banide was sacked due to this poor start to the 2011–12 season, and was replaced by Italian manager Marco Simone. Although he lifted the club to eighth by the end of the season, the club&#x27;s board targeted promotion for the upcoming season and so fired him and appointed his compatriot Claudio Ranieri, whose attacking style of football saw the club score 64 goals in the 2012–13 season. With the club only losing four times, Monaco finished the season as champions, earning promotion back to Ligue 1. Using Rybolovlev&#x27;s funds, Monaco were one of the biggest spenders in Europe in 2013, spending roughly £140 million, including a club-record £50 million for Radamel Falcao from Atlético Madrid and £40 million for James Rodríguez from FC Porto. Monaco finished in 2nd place in Ligue 1 in the 2013–14 season and Ranieri was replaced by Leonardo Jardim. The following season, Monaco cut expenses, selling Rodriguez to Real Madrid for €75m and loaning Falcao to Manchester United. Despite the high-profile departures, Monaco finished in 3rd place in Ligue 1 and made it to the quarter-finals of the Champions League, defeating Arsenal in the Round of 16 before exiting at the hands of Juventus. Top-scorer from the 2013–14 season Anthony Martial, who managed 12 goals in all competitions, departing for Manchester United in the summer for a fee of €60m, the highest fee paid for a teenager in football history. This, combined with the sales of Geoffrey Kondogbia, Layvin Kurzawa, Yannick Carrasco, Aymen Abdennour, Lucas Ocampos and others, saw the Monegasque club earn over €180m in the transfer window.

=== Ligue 1 triumph and aftermath (2016–present) ===
Monaco won the Ligue 1 title on 17 May 2017, defeating AS Saint-Étienne 2–0. Radamel Falcao and Kylian Mbappé scored 30 and 26 goals respectively to ensure a first Ligue 1 title in 17 years. Monaco went undefeated for the last 20 games of the season, winning 18 of those 20 games.

In the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League, Monaco staged a comeback in the Round of 16, losing the first leg 5–3 to Manchester City before beating the English side 3–1 at home to win on away goals. Monaco then defeated Borussia Dortmund 6–3 on aggregate before going down 4–1 over two legs to Juventus. In the summer, Kylian Mbappé went to rivals PSG on loan, with the obligation to buy for a fee of €180m, making it the second-highest transfer fee in history after Neymar. Teammates Bernardo Silva and Benjamin Mendy were sold to Manchester City for over €100m combined and Tiémoué Bakayoko was sold to Chelsea for €40 million. Monaco managed to finish 2nd in the 2017–18 Ligue 1, 13 points behind league winners PSG. In the summer of 2018, Fabinho was sold to Liverpool for €42 million.

Jardim was replaced as coach by Thierry Henry in October 2018 after a poor start to the season. Henry was suspended from his job in January, and Jardim returned days later. Monaco finished the season in 17th, avoiding relegation playoffs by 2 points. In December 2019 Jardim was fired for the second time in 14 months, and former Spain manager Robert Moreno was appointed in his place.

In 2019–20, the COVID-19 pandemic suspended and then curtailed the football season. Monaco ended the season in 9th. Moreno was sacked in July, and replaced by former Bayern Munich manager Niko Kovač, who finished the following season in third position with 78 points and winning 24 matches from 38 (63%). Kovač left at the start of the year 2022, being replaced by Philippe Clement. During Clement&#x27;s tenure spanning two seasons, the club fell short of securing a spot in the Champions League group stages, instead they found themselves competing in the Europa League, where they participated in the initial knockout rounds. In addition, they were unable to secure European football in his last season with a 6th-placed finish.

On 4 July 2023, Monaco appointed Adi Hütter who signed a two-year deal with the club. In his first season at the helm, he guided the club to a runner-up finish in the 2023–24 season, and qualification to the Champions League group stage for the first time since 2018–19.

== Stadium ==

Monaco played at the original Stade Louis II since its construction in 1939. In 1985, the stadium was replaced with the current iteration, built on a nearby site consisting of land reclaimed from the Mediterranean, which has become a recurring feature of the stadium&#x27;s seaside surroundings. The stadium is named after the former Prince of Monaco Louis II and houses a total of 18,523 supporters. The Stade Louis II is noted for its nine iconic arches and has hosted numerous athletic events and European Cup finals. Every August from 1998 to 2012, it hosted each instance of the annual UEFA Super Cup, but from 2013 onward, UEFA decided to rotate the event throughout various stadiums.

<doc id="222985" wikidata="Q4709449" url="?curid=222985" title="Albatross (horse)">
<text>Albatross (1968–1998) was a bay Standardbred horse by Meadow Skipper. He was voted United States Harness Horse of the Year in 1971 and 1972. Albatross won 59 of 71 starts, including the Cane Pace and Messenger Stakes in 1971, earned $1,201,477. It was, however, as a sire that he really made his mark. Albatross&#x27;s 2,546 sons and daughters won $130,700,280.

==Racing career==
Trained and driven by Harry Harvey from the time he was a yearling until a week before his three-year-old season and later Stanley Dancer, he won 14 of 17 starts at age two in 1970 including wins in the Lawrence Sheppard Pace, Roosevelt Futurity, Star Pointer Pace and Fox Stakes.

Early in 1972 he was syndicated for $1.25 million and Stanley Dancer became his trainer.
He won 25 of his 28 races as a three-year-old, including the Adios Pace, the Cane Pace, the Messenger Stakes, Battle Of The Brandywine, Prix d&#x27;Été, Shapiro Stakes and the American Classic against older horses. As a three-year-old he also set a record for fastest race mile with two races in 1:54.4 at The Red Mile in Lexington, Kentucky. It was the first time a horse and set and equalled or lowered a world record the same day. He was denied the Triple Crown when beaten in the Little Brown Jug by Nansemond.

He broke his world record as a four-year-old with a race in 1:54.3 at Sportsman&#x27;s Park in Chicago. Also in 1973 he won the Canadian Pacing Derby, National Pacing Derby, Realization Park and the American Classic for a second time.

Albatross set the single-season harness horse earnings record of $558,009 in 1971. and was the sports richest horse at the time of his retirement.

==Stud record==
After his four-year-old racing season he retired to stud at Hanover Shoe Farms in Hanover, Pennsylvania. One of his sons Niatross was the winner of the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers in 1980 and in that year was also a world champion with a mark of 1:49.1. Others were Fan Hanover, Merger, Colt Fortysix, and Jaguar Spur, all, like Niatross, winners of the Little Brown Jug. His sons and daughters made him the all-time leading stakeswinning sire. He was also an outstanding broodmare sire.

In 1998, Albatross died at the age of 30 at Hanover Shoe Farm in Pennsylvania of complications from heart failure and colic. He was buried at the Hanover Shoe Farms horse cemetery.

<doc id="222986" wikidata="Q1188761" url="?curid=222986" title="Act of Contrition">
<text>An Act of Contrition is a Christian prayer genre that expresses sorrow for sins. It may be used in a liturgical service or be used privately, especially in connection with an examination of conscience. Special formulae for acts of contrition are in use in the Anglican, Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist and Reformed Churches.

The Catholic Church does not restrict the term &quot;act of contrition&quot; to any one formula. Its &quot;Handbook on Indulgences&quot; mentions examples of approved formulas for an act of contrition the &quot;Confiteor&quot;, the Psalm &quot;De Profundis&quot;, the Psalm &quot;Miserere&quot;, the Gradual Psalms and the Penitential Psalms.

==Catholic Church==
The Act of Contrition is part of the Sacrament of Penance and is prayed by the penitent after the priest assigns a penance and before he gives the penitent absolution. It is also customarily said especially before one goes to bed at night. It is generally supposed that individuals might have recourse to an Act of Contrition when they find themselves &quot;in extremis&quot;. Fulton Sheen recounts a story told of John Vianney. When a recent widow bemoaned the death of her husband who committed suicide by jumping off a bridge, Monsieur le Curé observed, &quot;Remember, Madam, that there is a little distance between the bridge and the water.&quot; By this he meant that her husband had time to make an Act of Contrition. This is analogous to the well-known quote, &quot;Between the stirrup and the ground, he something sought and something found,&quot; indicating that mercy is available when sought. (The original quote is from the sixteenth century English antiquarian William Camden; the more familiar version is from Graham Greene&#x27;s 1938 novel &quot;Brighton Rock&quot;.)

The prayer expresses in words a deeply personal &quot;act&quot; that engages a person&#x27;s affections and will.

===A particular Latin formula and its English translations===
Within the Catholic Church, the term &quot;act of contrition&quot; is often applied to one particular formula, which is not given expressly in the handbook of Indulgences.

The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; notes that &quot;Among the penitent&#x27;s acts, contrition occupies first place. Contrition is &#x27;sorrow of the soul and detestation for the sin committed together with the resolution not to sin again.&#x27; When it arises from a love by which God is loved above all else, contrition is called &#x27;perfect&#x27; (contrition of charity). Such contrition remits venial sins; it also obtains forgiveness of mortal sins if it includes the firm resolution to have recourse to sacramental confession as soon as possible&quot; (CCC 1451–1452).

Catholic teaching holds that &quot;imperfect&quot; contrition, is also a gift of God. Born of fear of eternal damnation or other penalties, it is nonetheless sufficient to inspire a valid Act of Contrition.

There are different versions of the Act of Contrition, but all generally include an expression of sorrow, an acknowledgment of wrongdoing and a promise to amend one&#x27;s life and avoid sin. The Latin text and a number of English versions that approximate to the Latin text are given here.

====Latin text ====

===== Act of contrition of Pius X =====
:Deus meus, ex toto corde pænitet me omnium meorum peccatorum,
:eaque detestor, quia peccando,
:non solum pœnas a te iuste statutas promeritus sum,
:sed præsertim quia offendi te,
:summum bonum, ac dignum qui super omnia diligaris.
:Ideo firmiter propono,
:adiuvante gratia tua,
:de cetero me non peccaturum peccandique occasiones proximas fugiturum.
:Amen.

===== Act of contrition of Paul VI =====
:Deus meus, ex toto corde me pǽnitet ac dóleo de ómnibus quæ male egi et de bono quod omísi, quia peccándo offendi Te, summe bonum ac dignum qui super ómnia diligáris. Fírmiter propóno, 
:adiuvánte grátia tua, 
:me pæniténtiam ágere, 
:de cétero non peccatúrum peccantíque occasiónes fugitúrum. 
:Per mérita passiónis Salvatóris nostri Iesu Christi, Dómine, misérere.

====Traditional version====
:O My God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee,
:and I detest all my sins, because I dread the loss of heaven and the pains of hell, 
:but most of all because they offend Thee, my God, Who art all good and deserving of all my love. 
:I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace,
:to confess my sins, 
:to do penance
:and to amend my life. Amen.

====A popular Catholic American English worldwide version====
:My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart.
:In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good,
:I have sinned against You whom I should love above all things,
:I firmly intend, with Your help, to do penance, to sin no more, and to avoid whatever leads me to sin.
:Our Savior Jesus Christ, suffered and died for us.
:In His name, my God, have mercy. Amen.

====A modern version taught in Religious Education====
:Lord have mercy on me
:Do not look upon my sins
:But take away all my guilt
:Create in me a clean heart
:And renew within me an upright spirit
:Amen.

====Irish version====
O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee: and I detest my sins most sincerely because they displease Thee, my God, Who art so deserving of all my love for Thy infinite goodness and most amiable perfections: and I firmly purpose by Thy holy grace never more to offend Thee.

==== Nigerian version ====
“O my God, because You are so good, I am truly sorry that I have sinned against You and by the help of Your grace, I will not sin again.”

==== Ghanaian version ====
&quot;O my God, because You are so good. I am very sorry for having offended You and by the help of Your Holy Grace, I will not sin again.&quot;

====Other formulas for acts of contrition====
&quot;Sacrosanctum concilium&quot; (the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy) called for the revision of the Rite of Penance so that it more clearly express both the nature and effect of the sacrament. Consequently, the Rite of Penance was revised in 1973. The revised rite offered several possible options for making an Act of Contrition. One may choose one of the general formula prayers or other prayers of contrition.
The following are some formulas for acts of contrition that differ more considerably from the Latin text given above.

:My Lord, I am heartily sorry for all my sins,
:help me to live like Jesus and not sin again.
:Amen.

:Oh my God, I am sorry that I have sinned against You.
:Because You are so good, and with Your help,
:I will try not to sin again.
:Amen.

:Oh My God, because You are so good,
:I am very sorry that I have sinned against You,
:and by the help of Your grace, I will try not sin again.
:Amen.

:I love You, Jesus, my Love above all things. I repent with my whole heart for ever having offended You. Never permit me to separate myself from You again. Grant that I may love You always. Then do with me what You will. - Alphonsus Liguori

==Protestantism==
===Anglican Communion===
In the Church of England Reconciliation of a Penitent the Act of Contrition &quot;expresses the desire and intention before God to turn away from sin and walk in newness of life. The penitent may use his or her own words or the form provided.&quot;
The Anglican Communion, which includes the Church of England, The Episcopal Church and other member churches, has its own act of contrition, referred to in the Prayer Book as the General Confession. This is said by the Congregation en masse during worship. The 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; contains two versions. The first (for use at Matins and Evensong) is:

:ALMIGHTY and most merciful Father;
:We have erred, and strayed from Thy ways like lost sheep.
:We have followed too much the devices and desires of our own hearts.
:We have offended against Thy holy laws.
:We have left undone those things which we ought to have done;
:And we have done those things which we ought not to have done;
:And there is no health in us.
:But Thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable offenders.
:Spare thou them, O God, which confess their faults.
:Restore thou them that are penitent; According to Thy promises declared unto mankind in Christ Jesus our Lord.
:And grant, O most merciful Father, for His sake; That we may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober life, To the glory of Thy Holy Name. Amen.

The second (for use during Holy Communion) is:
ALMIGHTY God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
Maker of all things, judge of all men;
We acknowledge and bewail our manifold sins and wickedness,
Which we, from time to time, most grievously have committed,
By thought, word, and deed, 
Against thy Divine Majesty, 
Provoking most justly Thy wrath and indignation against us. 
We do earnestly repent, 
And are heartily sorry for these our misdoings; 
The remembrance of them is grievous unto us; 
The burden of them is intolerable.
Have mercy upon us, 
Have mercy upon us, most merciful Father; 
For Thy Son our Lord Jesus Christ&#x27;s sake, 
Forgive us all that is past; 
And grant that we may ever hereafter 
Serve and please Thee in newness of life, 
To the honour and glory of Thy Name; 
Through Jesus Christ our Lord. 
Amen.

Modernized forms can be found in other Anglican Prayer Books.

===Lutheran formula===
The Lutheran Church also has its own act of contrition, which is said during Holy Absolution. The following version, taken from the Lutheran Service Book (2006), says:

:O Almighty God, merciful Father,
:I a poor, miserable sinner, confess to You all my sins and iniquities,
:with which I have ever offended You and justly deserved Your punishment now and forever.
:But I am heartily sorry for them and sincerely repent of them,
:and I pray You of Your boundless mercy,
:and for the sake of the holy, innocent,
:bitter sufferings and death of Your beloved son, Jesus Christ,
:to be gracious and merciful to me, a poor sinful being.

<text>Christiane (Janni) Nüsslein-Volhard (; born 20 October 1942) is a German developmental biologist and a 1995 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine laureate. She is the only woman from Germany to have received a Nobel Prize in the sciences.

Nüsslein-Volhard earned her PhD in 1974 from the University of Tübingen, where she studied protein-DNA interaction. She won the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 1991 and the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1995, together with Eric Wieschaus and Edward B. Lewis, for their research on the genetic control of embryonic development.

==Early life and education==
Nüsslein-Volhard was born in Magdeburg on 20 October 1942, the second of five children to Rolf Volhard, an architect, and Brigitte Haas Volhard, a nursery school teacher. She has four siblings: three sisters and one brother. She grew up and went to school in south Frankfurt, where she was exposed to art and music and thus was &quot;trained in looking at things and recognizing things&quot;. Her great-grandfather was the chemist Jacob Volhard, and her grandfather was the known internist Franz Volhard. She is also the aunt of the Nobel laureate in chemistry Benjamin List.

After the Abitur in 1962, she briefly considered pursuing medicine, but dropped the idea after doing a month’s nursing course in a hospital. Instead, she opted to study biology at Goethe University Frankfurt. In 1964 Nüsslein-Volhard left Frankfurt for the University of Tübingen, to start a new course in biochemistry. She originally wanted to do behavioral biology, &quot;but then somehow I ended up in biochemistry (...) and molecular genetics because at the time this was the most modern aspect, and I was ambitious — I wanted to go where the leaders were. The old-fashioned botanists and zoologists were such dull people— there was nothing interesting there.&quot; 

She received a diploma in biochemistry in 1969 and earned a PhD in 1974 for research into protein–DNA interactions and the binding of RNA polymerase in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;.

==Career==
In 1975, Nüsslein-Volhard became a postdoctoral researcher in Walter Gehring´s laboratory at the Biozentrum, University of Basel. She was a specialist in the developmental biology of &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; (fruit fly) supported by a long-term fellowship from the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO).
In 1977, she continued in the laboratory of Klaus Sander at University of Freiburg, who was an expert in embryonic patterning.
In 1978, she set up her own lab in the newly founded European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg with Eric Wieschaus, whom she had met in Basel. Over the next three years they examined about 20,000 mutated fly families, collected about 600 mutants with an altered body pattern and found that out of the approximately 5,000 essential genes only 120 were essential for early development. In October 1980, they published the mere 15 genes controlling the segmented pattern of the Drosophila larva. 

In 1981, Nüsslein-Volhard moved to the Friedrich Miescher Laboratory of the Max Planck Society in Tübingen. 
From 1984 until her retirement in 2014, she was the director of the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in Tübingen and also led its genetics department. After 1984, she launched work on the developmental biology of vertebrates, using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as her research model. 

In 2001, she became a member of the &quot;Nationaler Ethikrat&quot; (National Ethics Council of Germany) for the ethical assessment of new developments in the life sciences and their influence on the individual and society. Her primer for the lay-reader, &quot;Coming to Life: How Genes Drive Development&quot;, was published in April 2006.

In 2004, she started the Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard Foundation (&quot;Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard Stiftung&quot;) which aids promising young female German scientists with children. The foundation&#x27;s main focus is to facilitate childcare as a supplement to existing stipends and day care.
===Research===

During the late 1970’s and early 1980’s, little was known about the genetic and molecular mechanisms by which multicellular organisms develop from single cells to morphologically complex forms during embryogenesis. Nüsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus identified genes involved in embryonic development by a series of  genetic screens, generating random mutations in fruit flies using ethyl methanesulfonate. Some of these mutations affected genes involved in the development of the embryo. They took advantage of the segmented form of &quot;Drosophila&quot; larvae to address the logic of the genes controlling development. They looked at the pattern of segments and denticles in each mutant under the microscope, and were therefore able to work out that particular genes were involved in different processes during development based on their differing mutant phenotypes (such as fewer segments, gaps in the normal segment pattern, and alterations in the patterns of denticles on the segments). Many of these genes were given descriptive names based on the appearance of the mutant larvae, such as &quot;hedgehog&quot;, &quot;gurken&quot; (German: &quot;cucumbers&quot;), and &quot;Krüppel&quot; (&quot;cripple&quot;). Later, researchers Pavel Tomancal, Amy Beaton, et al., identified exactly which gene had been affected by each mutation, thereby identifying a set of genes crucial for Drosophila embryogenesis. 

The subsequent study of these mutants and their interactions led to important new insights into early &quot;Drosophila&quot; development, especially the mechanisms that underlie the step-wise development of body segments. These experiments are not only distinguished by their sheer scale (with the methods available at the time, they involved an enormous workload), but more importantly by their significance for organisms other than fruit flies. 

Her findings led to important realizations about evolution – for example, that protostomes and deuterostomes are likely to have had a relatively well-developed common ancestor with a much more complex body plan than had been conventionally thought.

Additionally, they greatly increased our understanding of the regulation of transcription, as well as cell fate during development.

Nüsslein-Volhard is associated with the discovery of &quot;Toll&quot;, which led to the identification of toll-like receptors.

, Nüsslein-Volhard has an h-index of 104 according to Scopus.

==Personal life==
Nüsslein-Volhard married in the mid-1960s while studying at the Goethe University Frankfurt, but divorced soon afterward and did not have any children. She lives in Bebenhausen, Germany. She has said that she loves to sing, play the flute and do chamber music. She published a cookbook in 2006.

<doc id="223011" wikidata="Q631521" url="?curid=223011" title="Teratology">
<text>Teratology is the study of abnormalities of physiological development in organisms during their life span. It is a sub-discipline in medical genetics which focuses on the classification of congenital abnormalities in dysmorphology caused by teratogens and also in pharmacology and toxicology. Teratogens are substances that may cause non-heritable birth defects via a toxic effect on an embryo or fetus. Defects include malformations, disruptions, deformations, and dysplasia that may cause stunted growth, delayed mental development, or other congenital disorders that lack structural malformations. These defects can be recognized prior to or at birth as well as later during early childhood. The related term developmental toxicity includes all manifestations of abnormal development that are caused by environmental insult. The extent to which teratogens will impact an embryo is dependent on several factors, such as how long the embryo has been exposed, the stage of development the embryo was in when exposed (gestational timing), the genetic makeup of the embryo, and the transfer rate of the teratogen. The dose of the teratogen, the route of exposure to the teratogen, and the chemical nature of the teratogenic agent also contribute to the level of teratogenicity.

== Etymology ==
The term was borrowed in 1842 from the French , where it was formed in 1830 from the Greek (word stem ), meaning &quot;sign sent by the gods, portent, marvel, monster&quot;, and (&quot;-ology&quot;), used to designate a discourse, treaty, science, theory, or study of some topic.

Old literature referred to abnormalities of all kinds under the Latin term &quot;Lusus naturae&quot; (lit. &quot;freak of nature&quot;). As early as the 17th century, &quot;Teratology&quot; referred to a discourse on prodigies and marvels of anything so extraordinary as to seem abnormal. In the 19th century, it acquired a meaning more closely related to biological deformities, mostly in the field of botany. Currently, its most instrumental meaning is that of the medical study of teratogenesis, congenital malformations or individuals with significant malformations. Historically, people have used many pejorative terms to describe/label cases of significant physical malformations. In the 1960s, David W. Smith of the University of Washington Medical School (one of the researchers who became known in 1973 for the discovery of fetal alcohol syndrome), popularized the term &quot;teratology&quot;. With the growth of understanding of the origins of birth defects, the field of teratology overlaps with other fields of science, including developmental biology, embryology, and genetics.

Until the 1940s, teratologists regarded birth defects as primarily hereditary. In 1941, the first well-documented cases of environmental agents being the cause of severe birth defects were reported.

== Teratogenesis ==
=== Wilson&#x27;s principles ===
In 1959 and in his 1973 monograph &quot;Environment and Birth Defects&quot;, embryologist James Wilson put forth six principles of teratogenesis to guide the study and understanding of teratogenic agents and their effects on developing organisms. These principles were derived from and expanded on by those laid forth by zoologist Camille Dareste in the late 1800s:

# Susceptibility to teratogenesis depends on the genotype of the conceptus and the manner in which this interacts with adverse environmental factors.
# Susceptibility to teratogenesis varies with the developmental stage at the time of exposure to an adverse influence. There are critical periods of susceptibility to agents and organ systems affected by these agents.
# Teratogenic agents act in specific ways on developing cells and tissues to initiate sequences of abnormal developmental events.
# The access of adverse influences to developing tissues depends on the nature of the influence. Several factors affect the ability of a teratogen to contact a developing conceptus, such as the nature of the agent itself, route and degree of maternal exposure, rate of placental transfer and systemic absorption, and composition of the maternal and embryonic/fetal genotypes.
# There are four manifestations of deviant development (death, malformation, growth retardation and functional defect).
# Manifestations of deviant development increase in frequency and degree as dosage increases from the No Observable Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) to a dose producing 100% lethality (LD100).

== Causes ==
Common causes of teratogenesis include:
* Genetic disorders and chromosomal abnormalities
* Maternal health factors
** Nutrition during pregnancy (e.g., spina bifida resulting from folate deficiency)
** Metabolic disorders such as diabetes and thyroid disease
** Stress
* Chemical agents
** Prescription and recreational drugs (e.g., alcohol, thalidomide)
** Environmental toxins and contaminants (e.g., heavy metals such as mercury and lead, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs))
* Vertically transmitted infections such as rubella and syphilis
* Ionizing radiation such as X-rays and that emitted from nuclear fallout
* Temperatures outside the accepted range for a given organism

== Human pregnancy ==

In humans, congenital disorders resulted in about 510,000 deaths globally in 2010.

About 3% of newborns have a &quot;major physical anomaly&quot;, meaning a physical anomaly that has cosmetic or functional significance. Developmental defects manifest in approximately 3% to 5% of newborns in the United States, between 2% to 3% of which are teratogen-induced. Congenital disorders are responsible for 20% of infant deaths. The most common congenital diseases are heart defects, Down syndrome, and neural tube defects. Trisomy 21 is the most common type of Down Syndrome. About 95% of infants born with Down Syndrome have this disorder and it consists of 3 separate copies of chromosomes. Translocation Down syndrome is not as common, as only 3% of infants with Down Syndrome are diagnosed with this type. VSD, ventricular septal defect, is the most common type of heart defect in infants. If an infant has a large VSD it can result into heart failure. Infants with a smaller VSD have a 96% survival rate and those with a moderate VSD have about an 86% survival rate. Lastly, NTD, neural tube defect, is a defect that forms in the brain and spine during early development. If the spinal cord is exposed and touching the skin it can require surgery to prevent an infection.

=== Medicines ===

====Acitretin====
Acitretin is a retinoid and vitamin A derivative that is used in the treatment of psoriasis. Acitretin is highly teratogenic and noted for the possibility of severe birth defects. It was initially suggested as a replacement for Etretinate. It should not be used by pregnant women or women planning to get pregnant within 3 years following the use of acitretin. Sexually active women of childbearing age who use acitretin should also use at least two forms of birth control concurrently. Men and women who use it should not donate blood for three years after using it, because of the possibility that the blood might be used in a pregnant patient and cause birth defects. In addition, it may cause nausea, headache, itching, dry, red or flaky skin, dry or red eyes, dry or chapped lips, swollen lips, dry mouth, thirst, cystic acne or hair loss.

====Etretinate====
Etretinate (trade name Tegison) is a medication developed by Hoffmann–La Roche that was approved by the FDA in 1986 to treat severe psoriasis. It is a second-generation retinoid. It was subsequently removed from the Canadian market in 1996 and the United States market in 1998 due to the high risk of birth defects. It remains on the market in Japan as Tigason.

Isotretinoin

Isotretinoin is classified as a retinoid drug and is used as a treatment for severe acne. Prenatal exposure to isotretinoin can cause neurocognitive impairment in some children.

==== Vaccination ====
In humans, vaccination has become readily available, and is important for the prevention of various communicable diseases such as polio and rubella, among others. There has been no association between congenital malformations and vaccination — for example, a population-wide study in Finland in which expectant mothers received the oral polio vaccine found no difference in infant outcomes when compared with mothers from reference cohorts who had not received the vaccine.
However, on grounds of theoretical risk, it is still not recommended to vaccinate for polio while pregnant unless there is risk of infection.
An important exception to this relates to provision of the influenza vaccine while pregnant.
During the 1918 and 1957 influenza pandemics, mortality from influenza in pregnant women was 45%. In a 2005 study of vaccination during pregnancy, Munoz et al. demonstrated that there was no adverse outcome observed in the new infants or mothers, suggesting that the balance of risk between infection and vaccination favored preventative vaccination.

==== Reproductive hormones and hormone replacement therapy ====
There are a number of ways that a fetus can be affected in pregnancy, specifically due to exposure to various substances. There are a number of drugs that can do this, specifically drugs such as female reproductive hormones or hormone replacement drugs such as estrogen and progesterone that are not only essential for reproductive health, but also pose concerns when it comes to the synthetic alternatives to these. This can cause a multitude of congenital abnormalities and deformities, many of which can ultimately affect the fetus and even the mother&#x27;s reproductive system in the long term. According to a study conducted from 2015 till 2018, it was found that there was an increased risk of both maternal and neonatal complications developing as a result of hormone replacement therapy cycles being conducted during pregnancy, especially in regards to hormones such as estrogen, testosterone and thyroid hormone. When hormones such as estrogen and testosterone are replaced, this can cause the fetus to become stunted in growth, born prematurely with a lower birth weight, develop mental retardation, while in turn causing the mother&#x27;s ovarian reserve to be depleted while increasing ovarian follicular recruitment.

====Withdrawn drugs====
=====Thalidomide=====
Thalidomide was once prescribed therapeutically from the 1950s to early 1960s in Europe as an anti-nausea medication to alleviate morning sickness among pregnant women. While the exact mechanism of action of thalidomide is not known, it is thought to be related to inhibition of angiogenesis through interaction with the insulin like growth factor(IGF-1) and fibroblast like growth factor 2 (FGF-2) pathways. In the 1960s, it became apparent that thalidomide altered embryo development and led to limb deformities such as thumb absence, underdevelopment of entire limbs, or phocomelia. Thalidomide may have caused teratogenic effects in over 10,000 babies worldwide.

===Recreational drugs===

====Alcohol====

In the US, alcohol is subject to the FDA drug labeling Pregnancy Category X (&quot;Contraindicated in pregnancy&quot;). Alcohol is known to cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.

There are a wide range of affects that Prenatal Alcohol Exposure (PAE) can have on a developing fetus. Some of the most prominent possible outcomes include the development of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, a reduction in brain volume, still births, spontaneous abortions, impairments of the nervous system, and much more. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome has numerous symptoms which may include cognitive impairments and impairment of the facial features. PAE remains the leading cause of birth defects and neurodevelopmental abnormalities in the United States, affecting 9.1 to 50 per 1000 live births in the U.S. and 68.0 to 89.2 per 1000 in populations with high levels of alcohol use.

====Tobacco====
Consuming tobacco products while pregnant or breastfeeding can have significant negative impacts on the health and development of the unborn child and newborn infant.

=== Lead exposure during pregnancy ===
Long before modern science, it was understood that heavy metals could cause negative effects to those who were exposed. The Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides described the effects of lead exposure as something that &quot;makes the mind give way.&quot; Lead exposure in adults can lead to cardiological, renal, reproductive, and cognitive issues that are often irreversible, however, lead exposure during pregnancy can be detrimental to the long-term health of the fetus. Exposure to lead during pregnancy is well known to have teratogenic effects on the development of a fetus. Specifically, fetal exposure to lead can cause cognitive impairment, premature births, unplanned abortions, ADHD, and much more. Lead exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy leads to the greatest predictability of cognitive development issues after birth.

Low socioeconomic status correlates to a higher probability of lead exposure. A well-known recent example of lead and the impacts it can have on a was the 2014 water crisis in Flint, Michigan. Researchers have found that female fetuses developed at a higher rate than male fetuses in Flint when compared to surrounding areas. The higher rate of female births indicated a problem because male fetuses are more sensitive to pregnancy hazards than female fetuses.

== Other animals ==

=== Fossil record ===

Evidence for congenital deformities found in the fossil record is studied by paleopathologists, specialists in ancient disease and injury. Fossils bearing evidence of congenital deformity are scientifically significant because they can help scientists infer the evolutionary history of life&#x27;s developmental processes. For instance, because a &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; specimen has been discovered with a block vertebra, it means that vertebrae have been developing the same basic way since at least the most recent common ancestor of dinosaurs and mammals. Other notable fossil deformities include a hatchling specimen of the bird-like dinosaur, &quot;Troodon&quot;, the tip of whose jaw was twisted. Another notably deformed fossil was a specimen of the Choristodera &quot;Hyphalosaurus&quot;, which had two heads- the oldest known example of polycephaly.

=== Thalidomide and chick limb development ===
Thalidomide is a teratogen known to be significantly detrimental to organ and limb development during embryogenesis. It has been observed in chick embryos that exposure to thalidomide can induce limb outgrowth deformities, due to increased oxidative stress interfering with the Wnt signaling pathway, increasing apoptosis, and damaging immature blood vessels in developing limb buds.

=== Retinoic acid and mouse limb development ===
Retinoic acid (RA) is significant in embryonic development. It induces the function of limb patterning of a developing embryo in species such as mice and other vertebrate limbs. For example, during the process of regenerating a newt limb an increased amount of RA moves the limb more proximal to the distal blastoma and the extent of the proximalization of the limb increases with the amount of RA present during the regeneration process. A study looked at the RA activity intracellularly in mice in relation to human regulating CYP26 enzymes which play a critical role in metabolizing RA. This study also helps to reveal that RA is significant in various aspects of limb development in an embryo, however irregular control or excess amounts of RA can have teratogenic impacts causing malformations of limb development. They looked specifically at CYP26B1 which is highly expressed in regions of limb development in mice. The lack of CYP26B1 was shown to cause a spread of RA signal towards the distal section of the limb causing proximo-distal patterning irregularities of the limb. Not only did it show spreading of RA but a deficiency in the CYP26B1 also showed an induced apoptosis effect in the developing mouse limb but delayed chondrocyte maturation, which are cells that secrete a cartilage matrix which is significant for limb structure. They also looked at what happened to development of the limbs in wild type mice, that are mice with no CYP26B1 deficiencies, but which had an excess amount of RA present in the embryo. The results showed a similar impact to limb patterning if the mice did have the CYP26B1 deficiency meaning that there was still a proximal distal patterning deficiency observed when excess RA was present. This then concludes that RA plays the role of a morphogen to identify proximal distal patterning of limb development in mice embryos and that CYP26B1 is significant to prevent apoptosis of those limb tissues to further proper development of mice limbs in vivo.

=== Rat development and lead exposure ===
There has been evidence of teratogenic effects of lead in rats as well. An experiment was conducted where pregnant rats were given drinking water, before and during pregnancy, that contained lead. Many detrimental effects, and signs of teratogenesis were found, such as negative impacts on the formation of the cerebellum, fetal mortality, and developmental issues for various parts of the body.

== Plants ==
In botany, teratology investigates the theoretical implications of abnormal specimens. For example, the discovery of abnormal flowers—for example, flowers with leaves instead of petals, or flowers with staminoid pistils—furnished important evidence for the &quot;foliar theory&quot;, the theory that all flower parts are highly specialised leaves. In plants, such specimens are denoted as &#x27;lusus naturae&#x27; (&#x27;sports of nature&#x27;, abbreviated as &#x27;lus.&#x27;); and occasionally as &#x27;ter.&#x27;, &#x27;monst.&#x27;, or &#x27;monstr.&#x27;.

=== Types of deformations in plants ===
Plants can have mutations that leads to different types of deformations such as:
* Fasciation: Development of the apex (growing tip) in a flat plane perpendicular to the axis of elongation
* Variegation: Degeneration of genes, manifesting itself among other things by anomalous pigmentation
* Virescence: Anomalous development of a green pigmentation in unexpected parts of the plant
* Phyllody: Floral organs or fruits transformed into leaves
* Witch&#x27;s broom: Unusually high multiplication of branches in the upper part of the plant, mainly in a tree
* Pelorism: Zygomorphic flower regress to their ancestral actinomorphic symmetry
* Proliferation: Repetitive growth of an entire organ, such as a flower

== Research ==
Studies designed to test the teratogenic potential of environmental agents use animal model systems (e.g., rat, mouse, rabbit, dog, and monkey). Early teratologists exposed pregnant animals to environmental agents and observed the fetuses for gross visceral and skeletal abnormalities. While this is still part of the teratological evaluation procedures today, the field of Teratology is moving to a more molecular level, seeking the mechanism(s) of action by which these agents act. One example of this is the use of mammalian animal models to evaluate the molecular role of teratogens in the development of embryonic populations, such as the neural crest, which can lead to the development of neurocristopathies. Genetically modified mice are commonly used for this purpose. In addition, pregnancy registries are large, prospective studies that monitor exposures women receive during their pregnancies and record the outcome of their births. These studies provide information about possible risks of medications or other exposures in human pregnancies. Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can produce craniofacial malformations, a phenotype that is visible in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Current evidence suggests that craniofacial malformations occur via: apoptosis of neural crest cells, interference with neural crest cell migration, as well as the disruption of sonic hedgehog (shh) signaling.

Understanding how a teratogen causes its effect is not only important in preventing congenital abnormalities but also has the potential for developing new therapeutic drugs safe for use with pregnant women.

<doc id="223014" wikidata="Q1323698" url="?curid=223014" title="Indian classical music">
<text>Indian classical music is the classical music of the Indian subcontinent. It is generally described using terms like &quot;Shastriya Sangeet&quot; and &quot;Marg Sangeet&quot;. It has two major traditions: the North Indian classical music known as &quot;Hindustani&quot; and the South Indian expression known as &quot;Carnatic&quot;. These traditions were not distinct until about the 15th century. During the period of Mughal rule of the Indian subcontinent, the traditions separated and evolved into distinct forms. Hindustani music emphasizes improvisation and exploration of all aspects of a raga, while Carnatic performances tend to be short composition-based. However, the two systems continue to have more common features than differences. Another unique classical music tradition from the eastern part of India is &quot;Odissi music&quot;, which has evolved over the last two thousand years.

The roots of the classical music of India are found in the Vedic literature of Hinduism and the ancient &quot;Natyashastra&quot;, the classic Sanskrit text on performing arts by Bharata Muni. The 13th century Sanskrit text &quot;Sangeeta-Ratnakara&quot; of Sarangadeva is regarded as the definitive text by both the Hindustani music and the Carnatic music traditions.

Indian classical music has two foundational elements, &quot;raga&quot; and &quot;tala&quot;. The &quot;raga&quot;, based on a varied repertoire of &quot;swara&quot; (notes including microtones), forms the fabric of a deeply intricate melodic structure, while the &quot;tala&quot; measures the time cycle. The &quot;raga&quot; gives an artist a palette to build the melody from sounds, while the &quot;tala&quot; provides them with a creative framework for rhythmic improvisation using time. In Indian classical music the space between the notes is often more important than the notes themselves, and it traditionally eschews Western classical concepts such as harmony, counterpoint, chords, or modulation.

==History==
The root of music in ancient India are found in the Vedic literature of Hinduism. The earliest Indian thought combined three arts, syllabic recital (&quot;vadya&quot;), melos (&quot;gita&quot;) and dance (&quot;nrtta&quot;). As these fields developed, &quot;sangeeta&quot; became a distinct genre of art, in a form equivalent to contemporary music. This likely occurred before the time of Yāska (), since he includes these terms in his nirukta studies, one of the six Vedanga of ancient Indian tradition. Some of the ancient texts of Hinduism such as the &quot;Samaveda&quot; () are structured entirely to melodic themes, it is sections of &quot;Rigveda&quot; set to music.

=== Samaveda ===
The &quot;Samaveda&quot; is organized into two formats. One part is based on the musical meter, another by the aim of the rituals. The text is written with embedded coding, where &quot;swaras&quot; (octave notes) are either shown above or within the text, or the verse is written into &quot;parvans&quot; (knot or member); in simple words, this embedded code of swaras is like the skeleton of the song. The swaras have about 12 different forms and different combinations of these swaras are made to sit under the names of different ragas. The specific code of a song clearly tells us what combination of swaras are present in a specific song. The lyrical part of the song is called &quot;sahityam&quot; and sahityam is just like singing the swaras altogether but using the lyrics of the song. The code in the form of swaras have even the notation of which note to be sung high and which one low. The hymns of &quot;Samaveda&quot; contain melodic content, form, rhythm and metric organization. This structure is, however, not unique or limited to &quot;Samaveda&quot;. The &quot;Rigveda&quot; embeds the musical meter too, without the kind of elaboration found in the &quot;Samaveda&quot;. For example, the Gayatri mantra contains three metric lines of exactly eight syllables, with an embedded ternary rhythm.

=== Origins ===
In the ancient traditions of Hinduism, two musical genre appeared, namely &quot;Gandharva&quot; (formal, composed, ceremonial music) and &quot;Gana&quot; (informal, improvised, entertainment music). The &quot;Gandharva&quot; music also implied celestial, divine associations, while the &quot;Gana&quot; also implied singing. The Vedic Sanskrit musical tradition had spread widely in the Indian subcontinent, and according to Rowell, the ancient Tamil classics make it &quot;abundantly clear that a cultivated musical tradition existed in South India as early as the last few pre-Christian centuries&quot;.

The classic Sanskrit text &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; is at the foundation of the numerous classical music and dance traditions of India. Before &quot;Natyashastra&quot; was finalized, the ancient Indian traditions had classified musical instruments into four groups based on their acoustic principle (how they work, rather than the material they are made of) for example flute which works with gracious in and out flow of air. These four categories are accepted as given and are four separate chapters in the &quot;Natyashastra&quot;, one each on stringed instruments (chordophones), hollow instruments (aerophones), solid instruments (idiophones), and covered instruments (membranophones).

Of these, states Levis Rowell, the idiophone in the form of &quot;small bronze cymbals&quot; were used for &quot;tala&quot;. Almost the entire chapter of &quot;Natyashastra&quot; on idiophones, by Bharata, is a theoretical treatise on the system of &quot;tala&quot;. Time keeping with idiophones was considered a separate function than that of percussion (membranophones), in the early Indian thought on music theory.

The early 13th century Sanskrit text &quot;Sangitaratnakara&quot; (literally, &quot;Ocean of Music and Dance&quot;), by Sarngadeva patronized by King Sighana of the Yadava dynasty in Maharashtra, mentions and discusses &quot;ragas&quot; and &quot;talas&quot;. He identifies seven &quot;tala&quot; families, then subdivides them into rhythmic ratios, presenting a methodology for improvization and composition that continues to inspire modern era Indian musicians. &quot;Sangitaratnakara&quot; is one of the most complete historic medieval era Hindu treatises on this subject that has survived into the modern era, that relates to the structure, technique and reasoning behind &quot;ragas&quot; and &quot;talas&quot;.

The centrality and significance of music in ancient and early medieval India is also expressed in numerous temple and shrine reliefs, in Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, such as through the carving of musicians with cymbals at the fifth century Pavaya temple sculpture near Gwalior, and the Ellora Caves.

===Texts===
The post-Vedic era historical literature relating to Indian classical music has been extensive. The ancient and medieval texts are primarily in Sanskrit (Hinduism), but major reviews of music theory, instruments and practice were also composed in regional languages such as Kannada, Odia, Pali (Buddhism), Prakrit (Jainism), Tamil and Telugu. While numerous manuscripts have survived into the modern era, many original works on Indian music are believed to be lost, and are known to have existed only because they are quoted and discussed in other manuscripts on classical Indian music. Many of the encyclopedic Puranas contain large chapters on music theory and instruments, such as the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, the &quot;Markandeya Purana&quot;, the &quot;Vayu Purana&quot;, the &quot;Linga Purana&quot;, and the &quot;Visnudharmottara Purana&quot;.

The most cited and influential among these texts are the &quot;Sama Veda&quot;, &quot;Natya shastra&quot; (classic treatise on music theory, Gandharva), &quot;Dattilam&quot;, &quot;Brihaddesi&quot; (treatise on regional classical music forms), and &quot;Sangita Ratnakara&quot; (definitive text for Carnatic and Hindustani traditions). Most historic music theory texts have been by Hindu scholars. Some classical music texts were also composed by Buddhists and Jain scholars, and in 16th century by Muslim scholars. These are listed in the attached table.

==Major traditions==
The classical music tradition of the ancient and medieval Indian subcontinent (modern Bangladesh, India, Pakistan) were a generally integrated system through the 14th century, after which the socio-political turmoil of the Delhi Sultanate era isolated the north from the south. The music traditions of the North and South India were not considered distinct until about the 16th century, but after that the traditions acquired distinct forms. North Indian classical music is called &quot;Hindustani&quot;, while the South Indian expression is called &quot;Carnatic&quot; (sometimes spelled as &quot;Karnatic&quot;). According to Nazir Ali Jairazbhoy, the North Indian tradition acquired its modern form after the 14th or the 15th century.

Indian classical music has historically adopted and evolved with many regional styles, such as the Bengali classical tradition . This openness to ideas led to assimilation of regional folk innovations, as well as influences that arrived from outside the subcontinent. For example, Hindustani music assimilated Arabian and Persian influences. This assimilation of ideas was upon the ancient classical foundations such as &quot;raga&quot;, &quot;tala&quot;, &quot;matras&quot; as well as the musical instruments. For example, the Persian &quot;Rāk&quot; is probably a pronunciation of &quot;Raga&quot;. According to Hormoz Farhat, &quot;Rāk&quot; has no meaning in modern Persian language, and the concept of &quot;raga&quot; is unknown in Persia.

===Carnatic music===
If Hindustani music is taken in as an entirely new form of music created from Indian classical music and Persian music, then Carnatic music was a form from the south of the sub-continent that developed further natively after this divergence. Carnatic music is the ancient Indian classical music that became distinct after Hindustani music was established. It is dated back to ancient periods, but was only distinct after Hindustani music was established. Purandara Dasa (1484–1564) was a Hindu composer and musicologist who lived in Hampi of the Vijayanagara Empire. He is considered &quot;Pithamaha&quot; (literally, &quot;great father or grandfather&quot;) of the Carnatic music. Purandara Dasa was a monk and a devotee of the Hindu god Krishna (Vishnu, Vittal avatar). He systematised classical Indian music theory and developed exercises for musicians to learn and perfect their art. He travelled widely sharing and teaching his ideas, and influenced numerous South Indian and Maharashtra Bhakti movement musicians. These exercises, his teachings about &quot;raga&quot;, and his systematic methodology called &quot;Suladi Sapta Tala&quot; (literally, &quot;primordial seven talas&quot;) remains in use in contemporary times. The efforts of Purandara Dasa in the 16th century began the Carnatic style of Indian classical music.
Carnatic music, from South India, tends to be more rhythmically intensive and structured than Hindustani music. Examples of this are the logical classification of ragas into melakartas, and the use of fixed compositions similar to Western classical music. Carnatic raga elaborations are generally much faster in tempo and shorter than their equivalents in Hindustani music. In addition, accompanists have a much larger role in Carnatic concerts than in Hindustani concerts. Today&#x27;s typical concert structure was put in place by the vocalist Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar. The opening piece is called a varnam, and is a warm-up for the musicians. A devotion and a request for a blessing follows, then a series of interchanges between ragams (unmetered melody) and Tanam (the ornamentation within a melorhythmic cycle, equivalent to the &quot;jor&quot;). This is intermixed with hymns called krithis. The pallavi or theme from the raga then follows. Carnatic pieces also have notated lyrical poems that are reproduced as such, possibly with embellishments and treatments according to the performer&#x27;s ideology, referred to as Manodharmam.

Primary themes include worship, descriptions of temples, philosophy, and nayaka-nayika (Sanskrit &quot;hero-heroine&quot;) themes. Tyagaraja (1759–1847), Muthuswami Dikshitar (1776–1827) and Syama Sastri (1762–1827) have been the important historic scholars of Carnatic music. According to Eleanor Zelliot, Tyagaraja is known in the Carnatic tradition as one of its greatest composers, and he reverentially acknowledged the influence of Purandara Dasa.

A common belief is that Carnatic music represents a more ancient and refined approach to classical music, whereas Hindustani music has evolved by external influences.

===Hindustani music===
It is unclear when the process of differentiation of Hindustani music started. The process may have started in the 14th century courts of the Delhi Sultans. However, according to Jairazbhoy, the North Indian tradition likely acquired its modern form after the 14th or after the 15th century. The development of Hindustani music reached a peak during the reign of Akbar. During this 16th century period, Tansen studied music and introduced musical innovations, for about the first sixty years of his life with patronage of the Hindu king Ram Chand of Gwalior, and thereafter performed at the Muslim court of Akbar. Many musicians consider Tansen as the founder of Hindustani music.

Tansen&#x27;s style and innovations inspired many, and many modern &quot;gharanas&quot; (Hindustani music teaching houses) link themselves to his lineage. The Muslim courts discouraged Sanskrit, and encouraged technical music. Such constraints led Hindustani music to evolve in a different way than Carnatic music.

Hindustani music style is mainly found in North India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Prior to the Taliban&#x27;s ban on music, it also had a strong presence in Afghanistan. It exists in four major forms: Dhrupad, Khyal (or Khayal), Tarana, and the semi-classical Thumri. Dhrupad is ancient, Khyal evolved from it, Thumri evolved from Khyal. There are three major schools of Thumri: Lucknow gharana, Banaras gharana and Punjabi gharana. These weave in folk music innovations. Tappa is the most folksy, one which likely existed in Rajasthan and Punjab region before it was systematized and integrated into classical music structure. It became popular, with the Bengali musicians developing their own Tappa.

Khyal is the modern form of Hindustani music, and the term literally means &quot;imagination&quot;. It is significant because it was the template for Sufi musicians among the Islamic community of India, and &quot;Qawwals&quot; sang their folk songs in the Khyal format.

Dhrupad (or Dhruvapad), the ancient form described in the Hindu text &quot;Natyashastra&quot;, is one of the core forms of classical music found all over the Indian subcontinent. The word comes from &quot;Dhruva&quot; which means immovable and permanent.

A Dhrupad has at least four stanzas, called Sthayi (or Asthayi), Antara, Sanchari and Abhoga. The Sthayi part is a melody that uses the middle octave&#x27;s first tetrachord and the lower octave notes. The Antara part uses the middle octave&#x27;s second tetrachord and the higher octave notes. The Sanchari part is the development phase, which builds using parts of Sthayi and Antara already played, and it uses melodic material built with all the three octave notes. The Abhoga is the concluding section, that brings the listener back to the familiar starting point of Sthayi, albeit with rhythmic variations, with diminished notes like a gentle goodbye, that are ideally mathematical fractions such as &quot;dagun&quot; (half), &quot;tigun&quot; (third) or &quot;chaugun&quot; (fourth). Sometimes a fifth stanza called Bhoga is included. Though usually related to philosophical or Bhakti (emotional devotion to a god or goddess) themes, some Dhrupads were composed to praise kings.

Improvisation is of central importance to Hindustani music, and each &quot;gharana&quot; (school tradition) has developed its own techniques. At its core, it starts with a standard composition (bandish), then expands it in a process called &quot;vistar&quot;. The improvisation methods have ancient roots, and one of the more common techniques is called &quot;Alap&quot;, which is followed by the &quot;Jor&quot; and &quot;Jhala&quot;. The &quot;Alap&quot; explores possible tonal combinations among other things, &quot;Jor&quot; explores speed or tempo (faster), while &quot;Jhala&quot; explores complex combinations like a fishnet of strokes while keeping the beat patterns. As with Carnatic music, Hindustani music has assimilated various folk tunes. For example, ragas such as Kafi and Jaijaiwanti are based on folk tunes.

====Persian and Arab influences====
Hindustani music has had Arab and Persian music influences, including the creation of new ragas and the development of instruments such as the sitar and sarod. The nature of these influences are unclear. Scholars have attempted to study Arabic &quot;maqam&quot; (also spelled &quot;makam&quot;) of Arabian peninsula, Turkey and northern Africa, and &quot;dastgah&quot; of Iran, to discern the nature and extent. Through the colonial era and until the 1960s, the attempt was to theoretically study &quot;ragas&quot; and &quot;maqams&quot; and suggested commonalities. Later comparative musicology studies, states Bruno Nettl – a professor of music, have found the similarities between classical Indian music and European music as well, raising the question about the point of similarities and of departures between the different world music systems.

One of the earliest known discussions of Persian &quot;maqam&quot; and Indian &quot;ragas&quot; is by the late 16th century scholar Pundarika Vittala. He states that Persian &quot;maqams&quot; in use in his times had been derived from older Indian &quot;ragas&quot; (or &quot;mela&quot;), and he specifically maps over a dozen &quot;maqam&quot;. For example, Vittala states that the &quot;Hijaz maqam&quot; was derived from the &quot;Asaveri raga&quot;, and &quot;Jangula&quot; was derived from the &quot;Bangal&quot;. In 1941, Haidar Rizvi questioned this and stated that influence was in the other direction, Middle Eastern &quot;maqams&quot; were turned into Indian &quot;ragas&quot;, such as &quot;Zangulah maqam&quot; becoming &quot;Jangla raga&quot;. According to John Baily – a professor of ethnomusicology, there is evidence that the traffic of musical ideas were both ways, because Persian records confirm that Indian musicians were a part of the Qajar court in Tehran, an interaction that continued through the 20th century with import of Indian musical instruments in cities such as Herat near Afghanistan-Iran border.

===Odissi music===

Odissi music is a distinct type of Classical music of Eastern India. This music is sung during performance of classical Odissi dance.

The traditional ritual music for the service of Lord Jagannatha, Odissi music has a history spanning over two thousand years, authentic sangita-shastras or treatises, unique Ragas &amp; Talas and a distinctive style of rendition.

The various aspects of Odissi music include odissi prabandha, chaupadi, chhānda, champu, chautisa, janāna, mālasri, bhajana, sarimāna, jhulā, kuduka, koili, poi, boli, and more. Presentation dynamics are roughly classified into four: raganga, bhabanga, natyanga and dhrubapadanga. Some great composer-poets of the Odissi tradition are the 12th-century poet Jayadeva, Balarama Dasa, Atibadi Jagannatha Dasa, Dinakrusna Dasa, Kabi Samrata Upendra Bhanja, Banamali Dasa, Kabisurjya Baladeba Ratha, Abhimanyu Samanta Singhara and Kabikalahansa Gopalakrusna Pattanayaka.

==Features==

Classical Indian music is one genre of South Asian music; others include film music, various varieties of pop, regional folk, religious and devotional music.

In Indian classical music, the &quot;raga&quot; and the &quot;tala&quot; are two foundational elements. The &quot;raga&quot; forms the fabric of a melodic structure, and the &quot;tala&quot; keeps the time cycle. Both &quot;raga&quot; and &quot;tala&quot; are open frameworks for creativity and allow a very large number of possibilities, however, the tradition considers a few hundred &quot;ragas&quot; and &quot;talas&quot; as basic. &quot;Raga&quot; is intimately related to &quot;tala&quot; or guidance about &quot;division of time&quot;, with each unit called a &quot;matra&quot; (beat, and duration between beats).

===Raga===

A &quot;raga&quot; is a central concept of Indian music, predominant in its expression. According to Walter Kaufmann, though a remarkable and prominent feature of Indian music, a definition of &quot;raga&quot; cannot be offered in one or two sentences. &quot;Raga&quot; may be roughly described as a musical entity that includes note intonation, relative duration and order, in a manner similar to how words flexibly form phrases to create an atmosphere of expression. In some cases, certain rules are considered obligatory, in others optional. The &quot;raga&quot; allows flexibility, where the artist may rely on simple expression, or may add ornamentations yet express the same essential message but evoke a different intensity of mood.

A &quot;raga&quot; has a given set of notes, on a scale, ordered in melodies with musical motifs. A musician playing a &quot;raga&quot;, states Bruno Nettl, may traditionally use just these notes, but is free to emphasize or improvise certain degrees of the scale. The Indian tradition suggests a certain sequencing of how the musician moves from note to note for each &quot;raga&quot;, in order for the performance to create a &quot;rasa&quot; (mood, atmosphere, essence, inner feeling) that is unique to each &quot;raga&quot;. A &quot;raga&quot; can be written on a scale. Theoretically, thousands of &quot;raga&quot; are possible given 5 or more notes, but in practical use, the classical Indian tradition has refined and typically relies on several hundred. For most artists, their basic perfected repertoire has some forty to fifty &quot;ragas&quot;. &quot;Raga&quot; in Indian classical music is intimately related to &quot;tala&quot; or guidance about &quot;division of time&quot;, with each unit called a &quot;matra&quot; (beat, and duration between beats).

A &quot;raga&quot; is not a tune, because the same &quot;raga&quot; can yield a very large number of tunes. A &quot;raga&quot; is not a scale, because many &quot;ragas&quot; can be based on the same scale. A &quot;raga&quot;, states Bruno Nettl and other music scholars, is a concept similar to mode, something between the domains of tune and scale, and it is best conceptualized as a &quot;unique array of melodic features, mapped to and organized for a unique aesthetic sentiment in the listener&quot;. The goal of a &quot;raga&quot; and its artist is to create &quot;rasa&quot; (essence, feeling, atmosphere) with music, as classical Indian dance does with performance arts. In the Indian tradition, classical dances are performed with music set to various &quot;ragas&quot;.

===Tala===

According to David Nelson – an Ethnomusicology scholar specializing in Carnatic music, a &quot;tala&quot; in Indian music covers &quot;the whole subject of musical meter&quot;. Indian music is composed and performed in a metrical framework, a structure of beats that is a &quot;tala&quot;. A &quot;tala&quot; measures musical time in Indian music. However, it does not imply a regular repeating accent pattern, instead its hierarchical arrangement depends on how the musical piece is supposed to be performed.

The &quot;tala&quot; forms the metrical structure that repeats, in a cyclical harmony, from the start to end of any particular song or dance segment, making it conceptually analogous to meters in Western music. However, &quot;talas&quot; have certain qualitative features that classical European musical meters do not. For example, some &quot;talas&quot; are much longer than any classical Western meter, such as a framework based on 29 beats whose cycle takes about 45 seconds to complete when performed. Another sophistication in &quot;talas&quot; is the lack of &quot;strong, weak&quot; beat composition typical of the traditional European meter. In classical Indian traditions, the &quot;tala&quot; is not restricted to permutations of strong and weak beats, but its flexibility permits the accent of a beat to be decided by the shape of musical phrase.

The most widely used &quot;tala&quot; in the South Indian system is &quot;adi tala&quot;. In the North Indian system, the most common &quot;tala&quot; is &quot;teental&quot;. In the two major systems of classical Indian music, the first count of any &quot;tala&quot; is called &quot;sam&quot;.

===Instruments===
Instruments typically used in Hindustani music include the sitar, sarod, surbahar, esraj, veena, tanpura, bansuri, shehnai, sarangi, violin, santoor, pakhavaj and tabla. Instruments typically used in Carnatic music include veena, venu, gottuvadyam, harmonium, mridangam, kanjira, ghatam, nadaswaram and violin.

Players of the tabla, a type of drum, usually keep the rhythm, an indicator of time in Hindustani music. Another common instrument is the stringed tanpura, which is played at a steady tone (a drone) throughout the performance of the raga, and which provides both a point of reference for the musician and a background against which the music stands out. The tuning of the tanpura depends on the raga being performed. The task of playing the tanpura traditionally falls to a student of the soloist. Other instruments for accompaniment include the sarangi and the harmonium.

===Note system===
Indian classical music is both elaborate and expressive. Like Western classical music, it divides the octave into 12 semitones of which the 7 basic notes are, in ascending tonal order, &quot;Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni &quot; for Hindustani music and &quot;Sa Ri Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni &quot; for Carnatic music, similar to Western music&#x27;s &quot;Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti&quot;. However, Indian music uses just-intonation tuning, unlike some modern Western classical music, which uses the equal-temperament tuning system. Also, unlike modern Western classical music, Indian classical music places great emphasis on improvisation.

The underlying scale may have four, five, six or seven tones, called &quot;swaras&quot; (sometimes spelled as &quot;svaras&quot;). The &quot;swara&quot; concept is found in the ancient &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; in Chapter 28. It calls the unit of tonal measurement or audible unit as &quot;Śhruti&quot;, with verse 28.21 introducing the musical scale as follows,

These seven degrees are shared by both major &quot;raga systems&quot;, that is the North Indian (Hindustani) and South Indian (Carnatic) systems. The solfege (&quot;sargam&quot;) is learnt in abbreviated form: &quot;sa, ri (Carnatic) or re (Hindustani), ga, ma, pa, dha, ni, sa&quot;. Of these, the first that is &quot;sa&quot;, and the fifth that is &quot;pa&quot;, are considered anchors that are unalterable, while the remaining have flavors that differs between the two major systems.

Contemporary Indian music schools follow notations and classifications (see melakarta and thaat). Thaat, used in Hindustani, is generally based on a flawed but still useful notation system created by Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande.

==Reception outside India==
According to Yukteshwar Kumar, elements of Indian music arrived in China in the 3rd century, such as in the works of Chinese lyricist Li Yannian.
In 1958, Ravi Shankar came to the US and started making albums. These started a 1960s penchant for Indian classical music in the States. By 1967 Shankar and other artists were performing at rock music festivals alongside Western rock, blues, and soul acts. This lasted until the mid-1970s. Ravi Shankar performed at Woodstock for an audience of over 500,000 in 1969.
In the 1980s, 1990s and particularly the 2000s onwards, Indian Classical Music has seen rapid growth in reception and development around the globe, particularly in North America, where immigrant communities have preserved and passed on classical music traditions to subsequent generations through the establishment of local festivals and music schools. Numerous musicians of American origin, including Ramakrishnan Murthy, Sandeep Narayan, Pandit Vikash Maharaj, Abby V, and Mahesh Kale have taken professionally to Indian Classical Music with great success. In his 2020 released video, Canadian singer Abby V demonstrated 73 different Indian Classical ragas in a live rendering, which went viral on the internet; further establishing the growing prominence of Indian Classical Music around the globe.

==Organizations==
Sangeet Natak Akademi, is an Indian national-level academy for performance arts. It awards the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, the highest Indian recognition given to people in the field of performance arts.

SPIC MACAY, established in 1977, has more than 500 chapters in India and abroad. It claims to hold around 5000 events every year related to Indian classical music and dance. Organizations like Prayag Sangeet Samiti, among others, award certification and courses in Indian classical music.

Akhil Bharatiya Gandharva Mahavidyalaya Mandal (अखिल भारतीय गान्धर्व महाविद्यालय मंडल) is an institution for the promotion and propagation of Indian classical music and dance.

<text>The Cavalier Parliament of England lasted from 8 May 1661 until 24 January 1679. It was the longest English Parliament, and longer than any Great British or UK Parliament to date, enduring for nearly 18 years of the quarter-century reign of Charles II of England. Like its predecessor, the Convention Parliament, it was overwhelmingly Royalist and is also known as the Pensioner Parliament for the many pensions it granted to adherents of the King.

== History ==
=== Clarendon ministry ===
The first session of the Cavalier Parliament opened on May 8, 1661. Among the first orders of business was the confirmation of the acts of the previous year&#x27;s irregular Convention of 1660 as legitimate (notably, the Indemnity and Oblivion Act). Parliament immediately ordered the public burning of the Solemn League and Covenant by a common hangman. It also repealed the 1642 Bishops Exclusion Act, thereby allowing Church of England bishops to resume their temporal positions, including their seats in the House of Lords. Other notable pieces of first session legislation include the Militia Act placing the armed forces unambiguously under the king&#x27;s authority, and the Sedition Act. It also continued proceedings against the regicides of Charles I.

Later that same year (1661), Parliament passed the Corporation Act, the first of a series of acts known as the Clarendon Code, to cement the episcopal Anglican church as the official church of England. The Clarendon code is normally given as the following four acts:
* the Corporation Act 1661
* the Act of Uniformity 1662
* the Conventicle Act 1664
* the Five Mile Act 1665.

The Quaker Act 1662, specifically targeting Quakers, can also be cited as part of the new religious &#x27;code&#x27;. In January 1661, the Fifth Monarchists, anticipating the arrival of Jesus Christ to claim the throne, led a succession of revolts under the command of Vavasor Powell and Thomas Venner. To silence radical agitators and pamphleteers, Parliament passed the Licensing of the Press Act 1662, instituting government censorship of the press.

On the economic legislation, the Cavalier parliament had a notable Mercantilist bent. To promote the English cloth industry, it outlawed the exportation of raw materials, such as wool, raw hides and fuller&#x27;s clay (1662) and forbade the importation of finished materials like lace and embroidery (1662). It repealed old domestic restrictions on linen manufacturing (1663). To encourage the development of the American colonies as raw-material producers and consumers of English manufactured goods, the Cavalier parliament confirmed and reinforced the Navigation Act passed by the prior parliament in 1660, with the new Staple Act in 1663, requiring foreigners trading with the American colonies to transship their goods through English ports. Old corn laws were adjusted to the advantage of English farmers: the old restrictions on the exportation of wheat was gradually relaxed, exportation becoming fully free in 1670 and even subsidized with bounties after 1673. Conversely, the importation of wheat was restricted, with the first prohibitive tariffs on the importation of grains introduced in 1663 in a two-tier system, adjusted (1670) into a three-tier system based on current price. The importation of Irish cattle into Britain was forbidden (1666), giving English beef producers a protected home market (in trade, Scotland was already excluded altogether, treated as a foreign country on par with France). To facilitate the overseas operations of the charter companies, parliament inserted a clause into the 1663 Staple Act allowing the free exportation of coin and bullion – over the vigorous opposition of Arthur Annesley (Earl Anglesey), the leading mercantilist in parliament. To encourage the inflow of gold and silver from abroad and into circulation, the Coinage Act 1666 abolished seignorage, and introduced free minting at the Royal Mint.

The prior Convention of 1660 had promised King Charles II a generous annual revenue of £1.2 million, secured on customs duties and excise taxes. It was up to Cavalier parliament to ensure that the promise was kept. But in the first few years, the revenue fell short of the promised amount, and parliament had to look for new ways to make up for it. Parliament was responsible for the introduction of the controversial hearth tax (1662), with its unpopular and intrusive method of assessment (tax collectors had to go inside everyone&#x27;s private homes to count hearths). Another problem also emerged at this time: the sudden rise in the number of paupers, which had catapulted with the demobilization of the army. It was feared they would migrate &quot;en masse&quot; to the better-off parishes and swamp their social assistance programs. So, in another controversial piece of legislation, parliament changed the Elizabethan Poor Laws with the Act of Settlement and Removal (1662), legally restricting the poor to seeking assistance in their own home parish.

Other significant and curious pieces of early legislation include the first licensing of hackney carriages (1662), an act against &quot;excessive gaming&quot; (1663) and a famous 1663 act authorizing the erection of toll gates on the Great North Road, the prelude to a series of acts to help finance road-building for highways. 
In 1664, the Cavalier parliament amended the old Triennial Act so that it was now only suggested (rather than required) that the king summon a parliamentary session at least once every three years. In 1665, parliament met in Oxford to escape the Great Plague of London. The next year, in the aftermath of the Great Fire of London which ravaged the city in September 1666, parliament set up a court to settle disputes between landlords and tenants of burned buildings (Fire of London Disputes Act 1666), and passed a series of acts setting down regulations for rebuilding of the city (Rebuilding of London Act 1666).

Mercantilist agitation had prompted parliament to support the Second Anglo-Dutch War in 1665. But when the war turned out poorly in 1667, parliament decided to lay the blame on Charles II&#x27;s chief minister Edward Hyde (Earl of Clarendon) and the king&#x27;s brother and lord admiral, James, Duke of York. Parliament, echoing public belief, accused that the money voted for the war had been embezzled by court officers. Under pressure, Charles consented to setting up an independent commission for inquiry, but the verdict was inconclusive. Nonetheless, parliament decided to launch impeachment proceedings against Clarendon. Before these bore fruit, Clarendon went into exile.

=== Cabal ministry ===
Clarendon&#x27;s departure opened the way for the rise of a new crop of young ministers, known as &quot;the Cabal&quot;, a loose ministerial coalition consisting of Clifford, Arlington, Buckingham, Ashley, Lauderdale. The beginnings of what is now called a cabinet system began to emerge within the government. Sir George Downing, who had long stressed parliamentary prerogative in tying expenditures to specific sources (rather than just voting for supply and letting the crown allocate as it saw fit), became secretary to the Treasury, and helped overhaul crown finances, finally putting them on a steady course.

Nonetheless, parliament was shocked when, in 1668, the Cabal announced the &quot;Triple Alliance&quot;, which brought England into alliance with her recent enemy, the Dutch Republic. Although a league of northern Protestant powers had some appeal, mercantilist sentiment in parliament was still very strong, and the Netherlands was still seen as the main threat to England. Disillusioned by the lukewarm reception, Charles II re-oriented his foreign policy and struck up the notorious secret Treaty of Dover in May 1670, allying England and Louis XIV&#x27;s France, in a plan to dismember the Netherlands.

Despite their comparative energy and efficiency, the Cabal were a fractious and unpopular lot and their infighting spilled over publicly into parliament, particularly the House of Lords. At this stage, the House of Commons was &quot;de facto&quot; subservient to Lords, &quot;managed from above&quot; by the Lords&#x27; handlers, following their lead and echoing their quarrels. But Commons soon began to find its own voice. Finding the Cabal insufferable, Sir William Coventry resigned as Secretary to the Admiralty and went back to the House of Commons, where he emerged in 1669 as the formidable leader of a group of parliamentarians known as the &quot;Country Party&quot; – a group of MPs held together by their suspicion of corruption in high places, suspicious of the king&#x27;s dubious foreign policy and, increasingly, suspicious of his loyalty to Protestantism. The factions of a &quot;party political&quot; system thus gradually emerged in parliament, polarised between the Coventry-led &quot;Country Party&quot; (ancestral to the Whigs) and the &quot;Court Party&quot; (supporters of the king&#x27;s council, ancestral to the Tories).

The new self-assurance of Commons was felt in a quarrel that erupted during the 9th Session in 1670 between Lords and Commons, where Commons assailed the Lords&#x27; assumption that they had the right to amend their revenue bills. Finding their handlers could no longer control Commons, and that the goodwill that had attended Charles II at the Restoration was wearing thin, the Cabal recommended doing without them, and persuaded Charles II to keep parliament out of session with repeated prorogations.

The Third Anglo-Dutch War (begun in April 1672), however, soon forced Charles II&#x27;s hand. While parliament was prorogued, the Cabal had unwisely engineered the &quot;Great Stop of the Exchequer&quot; in January 1672, redirecting the revenues designated for the paying of government debt towards financing a new fleet for the upcoming war. The default prompted the goldsmith bankers of London to cease all further credit to the crown, forcing Charles II to finally call parliament again in early 1673 for its 10th Session to plead for funds. By this time, the war was not going very well, and English public sentiment, which had originally been itching for revenge on the hated Dutch, now swung firmly against it. Facing the Anglo-French onslaught, the Dutch republic had delivered itself into the hands of the charismatic young &quot;stadtholder&quot; William III of Orange, Charles&#x27;s own nephew. English public opinion (encouraged by Dutch propaganda) embraced the image of the heroic young Protestant prince valiantly defying an &quot;international Catholic conspiracy&quot; (uncomfortably close to the truth, given the secret Treaty of Dover). The Cabal defended the war vigorously – Ashley making his famous &quot;Delenda est Carthago&quot; speech before the House of Lords, comparing England to Rome and Holland to Carthage (an unusual classical reference for this audience). But Commons wanted to address a different item of business—the Declaration of Indulgence that had been issued by Charles II during the recess in 1672 suspending penal laws on Dissenters and Catholics. Parliament&#x27;s opposition to this was not merely a spasm of religious intolerance. The Declaration effectively suspended an act of Parliament, and the MPs were eager to emphasize the constitutional point that an act which was passed in session could only be modified, suspended or repealed in session. They also saw religion as a means to break the hated Cabal – which contained both crypto-Catholics like Arlington and Clifford and crypto-Presbyterians like Ashley and Lauderdale. Parliament believed the Cabal had been responsible for keeping them out of session and counselling to king to govern without them. To that end, parliament used its purse-strings to force not only the repeal of the Declaration but also the passage of the first Test Act in May 1673, requiring all office-holders to deny Catholic transubstantiation and take Anglican communion.

Following the Test Act, the members of the Cabal gradually resigned or were dismissed. Rather than submit to the Test, Clifford and, more significantly the king&#x27;s own brother and heir apparent, James Duke of York, resigned their offices. James&#x27;s refusal caught the public by surprise – and signalled the prospect that Charles II might be succeeded by a Catholic king. Through the late Summer of 1673, apprehension about James&#x27;s Catholicism was the talk of the day. When the next session opened in October 1673, Ashley (now Earl of Shaftesbury), sensing the new mood, turned up at the House of Lords to loudly denounce the proposed marriage of James of York to the Catholic princess Mary of Modena. The king angrily prorogued the session and dismissed Shaftesbury. Around that same time, Arlington and Buckingham fell into a quarrel, in the process of which the details of the secret Treaty of Dover were leaked to parliament, provoking an alarmed parliamentary inquiry. Arlington and Buckingham sheepishly appeared before the inquiry in January 1674, accusing each other of crafting the French alliance. His foreign policy in shambles, Charles II decided to pull England out of the controversial war. In February, Charles II took the unprecedented step of communicating the terms of the Treaty to Westminster to parliament before it was signed.

=== Danby ministry ===
With the fall of the Cabal (only Lauderdale lingered on in Scotland), Charles II turned to Thomas Osborne (Earl of Danby) as his chief minister. The House of Commons, which had played a significant role in the events of 1673, was comparatively calmed by Danby&#x27;s orthodox Anglican government and vigorous enforcement of the Test Act. But the drama now shifted to the House of Lords, where the dismissed Ashley-Shaftesbury, in alliance with the disgruntled Buckingham and George Savile (Viscount Halifax) (Coventry&#x27;s nephew), emerged as leader of the opposition to the government. In the House of Commons, the Country Party gained strength with the adherence of talented MPs like William Russell, William Cavendish, Henry Powle, Thomas Littleton and John Birch and coordinated their actions in Commons closely with Shaftesbury&#x27;s Lords.
Through the brief 12th session of early 1674, Shaftesbury and his friends, flexing their new muscles, steered a slew of provocative bills in the House of Lords, e.g. expelling Catholics from London, forcing an oath that renounced the Pope, requiring royal family members to get parliamentary consent on marriage and how to raise their children. Finally when Shaftesbury&#x27;s clique begin considering bringing James of York on charges of high treason, Charles II quickly prorogued the session, preventing the session&#x27;s act from being passed. The next year&#x27;s sessions of 1675 went little better: Shaftesbury led an attempt to impeach Danby, following the defeat of Danby&#x27;s proposed legislation to reinforce the Test Act with a new oath forswearing any attempt to &quot;modify&quot; the Church and State. The impeachment effort came to naught, but Danby responded to the opposition&#x27;s new muscle with a strenuous effort to construct a &quot;Court Party&quot; in the House of Commons to counter the Country Party (Danby&#x27;s generous bribes to MPs caused the Cavalier Parliament to also be known as the &quot;Pensionary Parliament&quot;).

After these calamitous sessions, Charles II prorogued parliament in November 1675 and kept it out of session for the next fifteen months (the &quot;Long Prorogation&quot;). When parliament resumed in February 1677, it opened with a bang. Shaftesbury (joined by Buckingham, Salisbury and Wharton), proclaimed the session illegitimate, claiming that the &quot;Long Prorogation&quot; implied that parliament was effectively dissolved and that the king must call for new elections. This prospect alarmed the House of Commons, whose members (unlike Lords) risked losing their seats. The leaders of the Country Party in Commons believed their party would be strengthened by new elections, but were unable to persuade other members to follow suit. While the combative lords were sent to the Tower of London for their challenge, Commons were only willing to agree that the long prorogation was probably unconstitutional, but that the session itself was not.

The session of 1677 had been called by Charles II to finance England&#x27;s re-entry into the Franco-Dutch War, which had been dragging on since England left in 1674, and hopefully get himself a seat at the peace table. Parliament was inclined, provided the king joined the Dutch side. To this end, Danby negotiated the marriage of James of York&#x27;s eldest daughter Mary to the Dutch Stadtholder William III of Orange in November 1677. But parliament was unwilling to provide enough funds to raise an army. The memoirs of the French ambassador Paul Barillon d&#x27;Amoncourt reveal extensive French communication (and bribery) of the MPs to delay supply – even Country Party leaders like Henry Powle, William Harbord and Thomas Littleton were paid. This has led some historians to speculate that parliament&#x27;s war-call was a bluff from the start, that they were more interested in denying the king a foreign policy victory and embarrassing Danby. Nonetheless, Charles II hurried things along in late 1677 by precipitously signing a treaty with William III to re-enter the war, and presenting it to parliament as a fait accompli. The reluctant parliament was forced to cough up enough funds to dispatch an expeditionary force of around 15,000 troops under the Duke of Monmouth to Flanders in May, 1678. But it was too late – the French and Dutch quickly wound up their negotiations (without England), and went on to sign the Treaties of Nijmegen ending the war. In June, parliament quickly voted a sum to finance the disbanding of the expeditionary force, but Charles II decided to use the money to maintain it instead for a few months longer, in the hope he might still affect the final treaty.
This humiliating conclusion to the king&#x27;s war policy dragged the political reputation of the King and Danby to a low point, making them vulnerable when the Popish Plot erupted in August and September 1678. When the 17th session opened that October, parliament was in a tremendously combative mood. Worked up by the Popish plot, they strengthened the Test Act with the Papists&#x27; Disabling Act excluding Catholics from both houses of parliament and the king&#x27;s court (James exempted). Parliament also demanded to know why the king had misapplied the June funds and was still maintaining the expeditionary force in Flanders. The session was finally wrecked when details emerged that, on Charles II&#x27;s instructions, Danby had entered into secret negotiations with Louis XIV in early 1676, promising England would &quot;not&quot; re-enter the war on the Dutch side, negotiations which had not been revealed during the 1677 debate. Parliament immediately impeached Danby, forcing Charles II to prorogue the session in December, 1678.

In the recess, Charles II entered into negotiations with Shaftesbury and other parliamentary leaders. In return for saving Danby from trial in the House of Lords, Charles II reluctantly agreed to their demands to finally dissolve parliament and call for new elections. The dissolution was announced on 24 January 1679, bringing the seemingly interminable Cavalier Parliament to its end.

After the elections, the new parliament – known as the Habeas Corpus Parliament (or &quot;First Exclusion Parliament&quot;) – was assembled in March, 1679.

== Officers ==

In the first decade, the Speaker of the House of Commons was Sir Edward Turnour (MP for Hertford), who was elected by the first session in 1661. Turnour become Solicitor-General in 1670 and held the speakership until 1671 (end of 9th Session), after which he was appointed the new Chief Baron of the Exchequer. At the opening of the 10th Session (February 1673), Job Charlton (MP Ludlow) was elected as the new speaker, but resigned after a month on account of ill-health. Sir Edward Seymour (MP for Totnes and Treasurer of the Navy) replaced him, and served as Speaker until the 1678 session, when the speakership went to the Sir Robert Sawyer (MP for High Wycombe). But Sawyer resigned within weeks, also on account of health, and Seymour stepped in again as speaker until the end of the Cavalier parliament.

== Sessions ==

At the 1660 Restoration, the Commonwealth era was obliterated from the legal record, with the result that Charles II&#x27;s regnal years officially begin on January 30, 1649 (the death date of Charles I). The Cavalier parliament thus officially begins on the thirteenth year of Charles II&#x27;s reign.

The Cavalier parliament went through seventeen sessions, although some sessions were broken up by adjournments and recesses (an &quot;adjournment&quot; only interrupts a session; a &quot;prorogation&quot; ends a session, a &quot;dissolution&quot; ends a parliament).

By English tradition, a parliamentary session passes only one public &quot;statute&quot;, albeit an act with various &quot;chapters&quot;. English legal statutes are cited by parliamentary session labeled by the regnal year in which that session sat. So the citation &quot;15 Cha 2. c. 4&quot; means &quot;the fourth chapter of the act passed by the parliamentary session that sat in the 15th year of the reign of Charles II&quot;. Charles II&#x27;s regnal year begins January 30, so if a single parliamentary session overlaps that date, it will usually be given a double label, e.g. &quot;19 &amp; 20 Cha. 2&quot; (the session that sat from the 19th to the 20th year of Charles II&#x27;s reign). If there are two sessions within the same regnal year, they are differentiated by a &quot;Statute&quot; suffix (e.g. 13 Cha. 2. St. 1 is a different session than 13 Cha. 2. St. 2). Finally, some sessions were prorogued without passing an act, and thus have no legal statute label at all.

The legal titles of parliamentary sessions of the Cavalier parliament are as given in the two most prominent compilations of statutes – the popular &quot;Statutes at Large&quot; (ed. Owen Ruffhead, 1762–65 or Danby Pickering 1762–66) and the official &quot;The Statutes of the Realm&quot; (ed. John Raithby, 1819). We note where the title differs between the two compilations.

The session dates are sometimes incorrect in the rolls. This table largely follows the dating in Cobbett&#x27;s &quot;Parliamentary History&quot;. (&quot;N.B.&quot; - In the 17th century, the English &quot;legal year&quot; began on March 25, so an act which is passed, say, on February 10, 1663, will be officially dated February 10, &quot;1662&quot;. This can be a cause of confusion. Cobbett notes the double date by a hyphen 1662–63, with the latter number as the historical calendar year. The table below follows the regular calendar dates.)

<doc id="223020" wikidata="Q1788384" url="?curid=223020" title="Klemheist knot">
<text>The klemheist knot or French Machard knot is a type of friction hitch that grips the rope when weight is applied, and is free to move when the weight is released. It is used similarly to a Prusik knot or the Bachmann knot to ascend or descend a climbing rope. One advantage is that webbing can be used as an alternative to cord. The Klemheist is easier to slide up than a Prusik. The klemheist is also a way to attach a snubber to the anchor rope of small boats, with the advantage that it is easy to undo.

Sometimes the knot name is misspelled as &quot;kleimheist&quot;, with an extra &quot;i&quot;.

== Technique ==

Make a secure loop of a cord (see Double fisherman&#x27;s knot) that is definitely narrower than the rope. Wrap from one end around the rope two or three times in a direction that will be down. The loose end is then threaded through the starting end, and carefully tightened to leave the wraps neat. In use, strain must be taken only on the hanging end. If the knot slips when load is placed on the hanging loop, re-tie around the climbing rope another time or two, until there is no slippage. Holding around the wraps will let you slide the knot up or down. Making the wraps slide when the hitch is under tension will create friction heat on the rope and the knot.

<text>The London Action Resource Centre (LARC) is an anarchist infoshop and self-managed social centre situated in Whitechapel, in the East End of London. Previously a school and a synagogue, it was purchased in 1999. It hosts meetings and events from various groups and is part of the UK Social Centre Network.

==History==
The building was constructed 1866–7 as a mission house and infants’ school, keeping this usage until around 1918. It then housed the Louise Michel International Modern School, organised by Jewish anarchists. It also hosted the New Worker&#x27;s Friend (Arbeter Fraynd) Club and the East London Anarchist Group. It was then converted into a synagogue in 1925. After World War II, the building was used in the rag trade before falling into dereliction.

LARC was purchased in the autumn of 1999 by people active in Reclaim the Streets, just after the Carnival against Capitalism which occurred on 18 June 1999. It was rebuilt over three years. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described it in 2005 as &quot;a hub of the new anarchist movement.&quot;

It has been used for events and as a meeting place by various groups, including the Radical Librarians Collective, Queeruption and Indymedia in London. It was originally known as the &quot;Fieldgate Action Resource Centre&quot;. LARC is part of the UK Social Centre Network, alongside other projects which were set up around the same time, like the Cowley Club in Brighton and the Sumac Centre in Nottingham, and also the 1 in 12 Club in Bradford. On its own website, the project states it is &quot;a cooperatively owned and run building dedicated to the furthering of social justice and environmental issues, locally, nationally and globally. We believe this is done through direct action, refusing to be a spectator or waiting for someone else to do it for us. It is about taking back power and realising our potential to bring about change. This is an anti-capitalist, non-hierarchical space.&quot;

In April 2022, the LARC was raided by the Metropolitan Police during protests by Just Stop Oil.

<doc id="223033" wikidata="Q1651414" url="?curid=223033" title="Gannet">
<text>Gannets are seabirds comprising the genus Morus in the family Sulidae, closely related to boobies. They are known as &#x27;solan&#x27; or &#x27;solan goose&#x27; in Scotland. A common misconception is that the Scottish name is &#x27;guga&#x27; but this is the Gaelic name referring to the chicks only.

Gannets are large white birds with yellowish heads, black-tipped wings and long bills. Northern gannets are the largest seabirds in the North Atlantic, having a wingspan of up to . The other two species occur in the temperate seas around southern Africa, southern Australia, and New Zealand.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Gannet&quot; is derived from Old English &quot;ganot&quot; meaning &quot;strong or masculine&quot;, ultimately from the same Old Germanic root as &quot;gander&quot;.

=== Taxonomy ===
&quot;Morus&quot; is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;moros&quot; &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;foolish&quot; due to lack of fear shown by breeding gannets and boobies, allowing them to be easily killed.

== Behaviour ==
=== Hunting ===
Gannets hunt fish by diving into the sea from a height of and pursuing their prey underwater, and have a number of adaptations:

* They have no external nostrils; they are located inside the mouth, instead.
* They have air sacs in the face and chest under the skin, which act like bubble wrap, cushioning the impact with the water.
* The position of their eyes is far enough forward on the face for binocular vision, allowing them to judge distances accurately.

Gannets can achieve speeds of 100 km/h (62.13 mph) as they strike the water, enabling them to catch fish at a much greater depth than most airborne birds.

The gannet&#x27;s supposed capacity for eating large quantities of fish has led to &quot;gannet&quot; becoming a description of somebody with a voracious appetite.

== Mating and nesting ==
Gannets are colonial breeders on islands and coasts, normally laying one chalky-blue egg. They lack brood patches and use their webbed feet to warm the eggs. They reach maturity around 5 years of age. First-year birds are completely black, and subsequent subadult plumages show increasing amounts of white.

=== Northern gannets ===
The most important nesting ground for northern gannets is the United Kingdom, with about two-thirds of the world&#x27;s population. These live mainly in Scotland, including the Shetland Isles. The rest of the world&#x27;s northern-gannet population nests in Canada, Ireland, the Faroe Islands, and Iceland, with small numbers in France (they are present in the Bay of Biscay), the Channel Islands, Norway, and a single colony in Germany on Heligoland. The biggest northern-gannet colony is on Scotland&#x27;s Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth; in 2014, this colony contained some 75,000 pairs.
Sulasgeir off the coast of the Isle of Lewis, St Kilda, Grassholm in Pembrokeshire, Bempton Cliffs in the East Riding of Yorkshire, Sceilig Bheag, Ireland, Cape St Mary&#x27;s, Newfoundland, and Bonaventure Island, Quebec, are also important northern-gannet breeding sites.

==Systematics and evolution==
The three gannet species are now usually placed in the genus &quot;Morus&quot;, Abbott&#x27;s booby in &quot;Papasula&quot;, and the remaining boobies in &quot;Sula&quot;. However, some authorities believe that all nine sulid species should be considered congeneric, in &quot;Sula&quot;. At one time, the various gannet species were considered to be a single species.




Most fossil gannets are from the Late Miocene or Pliocene, when the diversity of seabirds in general was much higher than today. The cause the decline in species at the end of the Pleistocene is not clear; increased competition due to the spread of marine mammals may have played a role.

The genus &quot;Morus&quot; is much better documented in the fossil record than &quot;Sula&quot;, though the latter is more numerous today. The reasons are not clear; boobies possibly were better adapted or simply &quot;lucky&quot; to occur in the right places for dealing with the challenges of the Late Pliocene ecological change, or many more fossil boobies could still await discovery. Notably, gannets are today restricted to temperate oceans, while boobies are also found in tropical waters, whereas several of the prehistoric gannet species had a more equatorial distribution than their congeners of today.

Fossil species of gannets are:

* &quot;Morus loxostylus&quot; (Early Miocene of EC USA) – includes &quot;M. atlanticus&quot;
* &quot;Morus olsoni&quot; (Middle Miocene of Romania)
* &quot;Morus lompocanus&quot; (Lompoc Late Miocene of Lompoc, USA)
* &quot;Morus magnus&quot; (Late Miocene of California)
* &quot;Morus peruvianus&quot; (Pisco Late Miocene of Peru)
* &quot;Morus vagabundus&quot; (Temblor Late Miocene of California)
* &quot;Morus willetti&quot; (Late Miocene of California) – formerly in &quot;Sula&quot;
* &quot;Morus&quot; sp. (Temblor Late Miocene of Sharktooth Hill, US: Miller 1961) – possibly &quot;M. magnus&quot;
* &quot;Morus&quot; sp. 1 (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Lee Creek Mine, US)
* &quot;Morus&quot; sp. 2 (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Lee Creek Mine, US)
* &quot;Morus peninsularis&quot; (Early Pliocene)
* &quot;Morus recentior&quot; (Middle Pliocene of California, US)
* &quot;Morus reyanus&quot; – Del Rey gannet (Late Pleistocene of W US)

==Cultural references==
In many parts of the United Kingdom, the term &quot;&quot; is used to refer to people who steadily eat vast quantities of food, especially at public functions.

Young gannets were historically used as a food source, a tradition still practised in Ness, Scotland, where they are called &quot;guga&quot;. Like examples of continued traditional whale harvesting, the modern-day hunting of gannet chicks results in great controversies as to whether it should continue to be given &quot;exemption from the ordinary protection afforded to sea birds in UK and EU law&quot;. The Ness hunt is currently limited to 2,000 chicks per year and dates back at least to the Iron Age. The hunt is considered to be sustainable, since between 1902 and 2003 gannet numbers in Scotland increased dramatically from 30,000 to 180,000.

In The Bookshop Sketch, originally from &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot; (1967), a customer (Marty Feldman) asks the bookshop proprietor (John Cleese) for &quot;the expurgated version&quot; of &quot;Olsen&#x27;s Standard Book of British Birds&quot;, &quot;the one without the gannet&quot;, because he does not like gannets owing to their &quot;long nasty beaks&quot;. Desperate to satisfy the customer, the proprietor tears the page about the gannet out of the book, only for the customer then to refuse to buy it because it is damaged. The sketch is reprised in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Contractual Obligation Album&quot;, where the customer (Graham Chapman) says he does not like the gannet because &quot;they wet their nests.&quot;

In Series 1, Episode 3, of &quot;The F Word&quot;, Gordon Ramsay travels to the northwestern coast of Scotland and is shown how to prepare, cook and eat gannet.

<text>A booby is a seabird in the genus Sula, part of the family Sulidae. Boobies are closely related to the gannets (&quot;Morus&quot;), which were formerly included in &quot;Sula&quot;.

==Systematics and evolution==
The genus &quot;Sula&quot; was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The type species is the brown booby. The name is derived from &quot;súla&quot;, the Old Norse and Icelandic word for the other member of the family Sulidae, the gannet.

The English name &quot;booby&quot; may derive from the Spanish slang term , meaning &quot;stupid&quot;, as these tame birds had a habit of landing on board sailing ships, where they were easily captured and eaten. Owing to this, boobies are often mentioned as having been caught and eaten by shipwrecked sailors, including William Bligh of the &quot;Bounty&quot; and his adherents during their voyage after being set adrift by Fletcher Christian and his followers.

Six of the ten extant Sulidae species called &quot;boobies&quot; are in the genus &quot;Sula&quot;, while the three gannet species are usually placed in the genus &quot;Morus&quot;. Abbott&#x27;s booby was formerly included in &quot;Sula&quot; but is now placed in a monotypic genus &quot;Papasula&quot;, which represents an ancient lineage perhaps closer to &quot;Morus&quot;. Some authorities consider that all ten species should be considered in &quot;Sula&quot;. However, they are readily distinguished by means of osteology. The distinct lineages of gannets and boobies are known to have existed in such form, since at least the Middle Miocene ().

The fossil record of boobies is not as well documented as that of gannets, either because booby speciation was lower from the late Miocene to the Pliocene (when gannet diversity was at its highest), or because the booby fossil species record is as yet incomplete due to most localities being equatorial or in the Southern Hemisphere.

==Behaviour==
Boobies hunt fish by diving from a height into the sea and pursuing their prey underwater. Facial air sacs under their skin cushion the impact with the water. Boobies are colonial breeders on islands and coasts. They normally lay one or more chalky-blue eggs on the ground or sometimes in a tree nest. Selective pressures, likely through competition for resource, have shaped the ecomorphology and foraging behaviours of the six species of boobies in the Pacific.

<doc id="223042" wikidata="Q457981" url="?curid=223042" title="Great Teacher Onizuka">
<text>Great Teacher Onizuka, officially abbreviated as GTO, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Tooru Fujisawa. It was originally serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; from January 1997 to February 2002, with its chapters collected in 25 volumes. The story focuses on 22-year-old ex- member Eikichi Onizuka, who becomes a teacher at a private middle school, Holy Forest Academy, in Tokyo, Japan. It is a standalone sequel to Fujisawa&#x27;s earlier manga series &quot;Shonan Junai Gumi&quot; and &quot;Bad Company&quot;, both of which focus on the life of Onizuka before becoming a teacher.

Due to the popularity of the manga, several adaptations of &quot;GTO&quot; were created, including a 12-episode Japanese television drama running from July to September 1998; a live-action film directed by Masayuki Suzuki and released in December 1999; and a 43-episode anime television series produced by Pierrot, which aired in Japan on Fuji TV from June 1999 to September 2000. A second live-action series aired in Japan during 2012, and two more in 2014.

A sequel manga series, titled &quot;&quot;, ran in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; from June 2009 to September 2011. Another sequel, titled &quot;&quot;, began in &quot;Weekly Young Magazine&quot; in April 2014. Both the anime and manga were licensed in North America by Tokyopop. The anime series was re-licensed by Discotek Media in 2012. The manga is licensed by Kodansha USA.

The manga has had over 50 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series in history. In 1998, &quot;Great Teacher Onizuka&quot; won the 22nd Kodansha Manga Award in the category.

==Plot==

Eikichi Onizuka is a 22-year-old ex-gang member who wants to lose his virginity. While peeping up girls&#x27; skirts at a local shopping mall, Onizuka meets a schoolgirl who agrees to go out on a date with him. Onizuka&#x27;s attempt to sleep with her fails when her current &quot;boyfriend&quot;, her teacher, shows up at the love hotel they are in and asks her to return to him. The teacher is old and ugly, but has sufficient influence over her that she leaps from a second-story window and lands in his arms.

Onizuka, upon seeing this display of a teacher&#x27;s power over girls, decides to become a teacher himself. He earns his teaching degree, just barely, at a second-rate college. In his quest, he develops a conscience. This means taking advantage of impressionable schoolgirls is out of the question, but their unusually attractive mothers are a different matter. He enjoys teaching and, most of the time, he teaches life lessons rather than routine schoolwork. He hates the system of traditional education, especially when other teachers and administrators have grown ignorant and condescending to students and their needs. With these realizations, he sets out to become the greatest teacher ever, using his own unique brand of philosophy and the ability to do nearly anything when under enough pressure. He is hired as a long-shot teacher by a privately operated middle school in Kichijōji to tame a class that has driven one teacher to a mysterious death, another to a nervous breakdown, and one other to joining a cult. He embarks on a mission of self-discovery by reaching out to each student one by one and helping each student overcome their problems and learn to enjoy life. He uses methods that are unorthodox, illegal, and life-threatening, yet he manages to succeed in educating and opening up his students.

==Production==
When writing &quot;GTO&quot;, Fujisawa was influenced by the writing style of Kōhei Tsuka. The series was originally intended to run for 10 volumes; however, it was extended at the request of the publisher. Fujisawa began to run out of characters as a result. When faced with writing block he would write stories without Onizuka. Onizuka&#x27;s first name, Eikichi, was taken from musician Eikichi Yazawa. When developing Onizuka&#x27;s character for the series, Fujisawa sought to incorporate real character traits from Japanese gangs often referred to as &quot;Yankees&quot;. Onizuka&#x27;s look is modelled on such gang members and was not intended to convey an &quot;American look&quot;. Onizuka acts tough and confident but is actually shy and lacking in confidence to follow through on some of his desires. He is a simple character that stands by his own reasoning and principles and has his own conscience. Fujisawa gave him the viewpoint that you should take responsibility for your actions, something he sees as important.

Onizuka&#x27;s role in the school is to provide a bridge between the students and teachers. The character of Fuyutsuki reflects the point of view of the average teacher. Fujisawa built the series on his own school experience where teachers were mostly focused only on a good performance record rather than the teaching itself. However, he was able to take an interest in mathematics because of the approach of his teacher. Tatsuya Egawa has claimed that &quot;GTO&quot; plagiarized his debut manga, &quot;Be Free!&quot;.

Tokyopop licensed the series for release in North America and released it across 10 DVDs between March 22, 2002, and September 16, 2003, and for American TV broadcast on Showtime&#x27;s SHONext channel in 2004 and Comcast&#x27;s Anime Selects on Demand network in 2006.

===Live-action===
A 12-episode television drama adaptation starring Takashi Sorimachi as the titular character was broadcast on Fuji TV from July 7 to September 22, 1998. Some of the manga&#x27;s more violent and smutty elements were toned down in the TV drama. Changes were also made to the character of Fuyutsuki (Nanako Matsushima) who disliked Onizuka early on in the drama and had wanted to leave teaching to become an Air Hostess (contrasting her depiction as an eager teacher who supported Onizuka throughout the manga). A television special was broadcast on June 29, 1999. This was followed by a theatrical movie in January 2000. The movie was released in North America by Media Blasters, under their Tokyo Shock division, on July 26, 2005.
During 2012, it was announced that a new live-action series would be broadcast in Japan. Produced by KTV and Media Mix Japan, the series ran from July 3, 2012, until September 11, 2012. Originally, Jin Akanishi was to play the role of Onizuka; however, he was forced to withdraw by his management. Instead, Akira of Japanese band Exile was selected to play Onizuka. An Autumn special was broadcast on October 2, 2012, followed by a New Year&#x27;s special on January 2, 2013, and a Spring special on April 2, 2013. On March 22, 2014, a 4-part mini-series aired in Taiwan on GTV Variety Show, before being broadcast in Japan at a later date. The mini-series places Onizuka in a Taiwanese school as part of a training program and is a joint Japan/Taiwan co production that contains both Japanese and Mandarin Chinese dialogue. The series has been announced for English subtitled release via the Crunchyroll streaming service. A new series set in Japan aired from July to September 2014.

A new version of the original drama, with the title character reprised by Sorimachi, was announced to air in 2024, as part of Fuji TV&#x27;s 65th anniversary, under the title &quot;GTO Revival&quot;. The cast of third-year students and teacher team of Sotoku Gakuin High School, where this version takes place, includes (as Miyu Ayahara, a third-year homeroom and Japanese History teacher), Shinya Kote (as Takeshi Fujida, the vice-principal), Rikako Yagi (as Suzuka Ichikawa, an honor student, with a strained relationship with her father), (as Rin Endo, a student whose father&#x27;s company&#x27;s fraud problem was exposed), (as Haruto Uno, a student on a baseball scholarship, unable to play because of an injury, whose father despises him for this), and Kosuke Suzuki (as Koichi Ichikawa, Suzuka&#x27;s father and a candidate for the House of Representatives). It premiered on April 1, 2024. Seven cast members from the original are reprising their roles in this new version: Hiroyuki Ikeuchi as Kunio Murai, as Masaru Watanabe, Yōsuke Kubozuka as Yoshito Kikuchi, Hidenori Tokuyama as Kenji Youda, Shun Oguri as Noboru Yoshikawa, Naohito Fujiki as Ryuji Saejima, and Nanako Matsushima as Azusa Fuyutsuki.

The theme song for the original series is , performed by Sorimachi. For the 2024 revival version, a new version of the song, titled &quot;Poison&quot;, is performed by Sorimachi with .

==Reception==
By November 2007, the manga had over 50 million copies in circulation. &quot;Great Teacher Onizuka&quot; won the 22nd Kodansha Manga Award for the category in 1998.

In &quot;&quot;, Jason Thompson referred to the manga as &quot;shameless, frequently sexist and totally hilarious&quot;. He gave it four stars out of four, praising its imagery, detailed art, and &quot;smutty, pop culture-laden dialogue&quot;. He added that in its best moments, the manga &quot;goes beyond the level of an Adam Sandler movie and approaches true social satire&quot;. 

The 1998 live-action series had an average audience share of 28.5% with the final episode recording a rate of 35.7%. The final episode was the eighth-most-watched broadcast in the Kantō region during 1998. The 2000 live-action film sequel grossed ¥1.32 billion at the box office, becoming the tenth-highest-grossing film of the year.

In &quot;The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917&quot;, Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy noted the anime&#x27;s use of computer graphics for cloud and water effects to cover up &quot;the cheap TV animation&quot;. They called the 1998 live-action adaptation &quot;the quintessential GTO, with its handsome loner [protagonist] fighting injustices on his motorcycle like an educational lawman&quot; but still found the anime adaptation to have &quot;considerable bite&quot; due to its animated origins allowing for &quot;slightly more violence and menace than its prime-time live-action counterpart.&quot; 

In 2008, Russian network 2x2 came under investigation by Rossvyazkomnadzor, the government watchdog, for allegedly promoting &quot;child pornography, sexual aberrations, violence and cruelty&quot; by broadcasting the &quot;GTO&quot; anime.

<text>Allan Cunningham (7 December 178430 October 1842) was a Scottish poet and author.

==Life==
He was born at Keir, near Dalswinton, Dumfries and Galloway, and first worked as a stonemason&#x27;s apprentice. His father was a neighbour of Robert Burns at Ellisland, and Allan with his brother James visited James Hogg, the &quot;Ettrick shepherd&quot;, who became a friend to both. Cunningham&#x27;s other brothers were the naval surgeon Peter Miller Cunningham (1789–1864) and the poet, Thomas Mounsey Cunningham (1776–1834).

Cunningham gave his leisure to reading and writing imitations of old Scottish ballads. In 1809 he collected old ballads for Robert Hartley Cromek&#x27;s &quot;Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song&quot;; he sent in, however, poems of his own, which the editor inserted, even though he may have suspected their real authorship. It gained for him the friendship of Walter Scott and James Hogg.

In 1810 Cunningham went to London, where he worked as a parliamentary reporter and journalist until 1814, when he became clerk of the works in the studio of the sculptor, Francis Chantrey, a post he kept until Chantrey&#x27;s death in 1841.

==Works==
Cunningham contributed some songs to Eugenius Roche&#x27;s &quot;Literary Recreations&quot; in 1807. He wrote three novels, a life of Sir David Wilkie, and &quot;Lives of Eminent British Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&quot; (1829–33), that include biographies of William Hogarth, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Thomas Gainsborough and William Blake.

Besides these, he wrote many songs. &quot;A Wet Sheet and a Flowing Sea&quot; is a sea-song; and many other of Cunningham&#x27;s songs became popular. He also brought out an edition of Robert Burns&#x27; Works.

Other works included:

*&quot;Sir Marmaduke Maxwell&quot; (1820) (play)
*&quot;The King of the Peak&quot; (1822), the story of Sir George Vernon and his daughter, Dorothy Vernon&#x27;s supposed elopement with John Manners from Haddon Hall.
*&quot;The Maid of Elvar&quot; (1830) (a poem, in twelve parts)
*&quot;The Life and Correspondence of Robert Burns&quot; (1836)
*&quot;The Poems, Letters and Land of Robert Burns&quot; (1838), a new memoir of the poet and notices critical and biographical of his works

==Family==
Cunningham was married to Jean Walker, who had been servant in a house where he lived, and they had five sons and one daughter, all of whom rose to important positions, and inherited in some degree his literary gifts. Among them were Joseph Davey Cunningham, Alexander Cunningham, Peter Cunningham and Francis Cunningham.
