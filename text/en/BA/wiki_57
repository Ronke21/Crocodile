<doc id="220151" wikidata="Q1156053" url="?curid=220151" title="List of mountain ranges">
<text>This is a list of mountain ranges on Earth and a few other astronomical bodies. First, the highest and longest mountain ranges on Earth are listed, followed by more comprehensive alphabetical lists organized by continent. Ranges in the oceans and on other celestial bodies are listed afterwards.

== Mountain ranges on Earth ==

===By height===

* Part of Hindu Kush-Himalayas region

All of the Asian ranges above have been formed in part over the past 35 to 55 million years by the collision between the Indian Plate and Eurasian Plate. The Indian Plate is still particularly mobile and these mountain ranges continue to rise in elevation every year and this page may need to be updated in a few years; of these the Himalayas are rising most quickly; the Kashmir and Pamirs region to the north of the Indian subcontinent is the point of confluence of these mountains which encircle the Tibetan Plateau.

===By prominence===

<text>This is a complete list of basilicas of the Catholic Church. A basilica is a church with certain privileges conferred on it by the Pope.

Not all churches with &quot;basilica&quot; in their title actually have the ecclesiastical status, which can lead to confusion, since it is also an architectural term for a church-building style.

In the 18th century, the term took on a canonical sense, unrelated to this architectural style. Basilicas in this canonical sense are divided into major (&quot;greater&quot;) and minor basilicas. Today only four, all in the Diocese of Rome, are classified as major basilicas: the major basilicas of St John Lateran, St Peter&#x27;s, St Paul outside the Walls, and St Mary Major. The other canonical basilicas are minor basilicas.

By canon law no Catholic church can be honoured with the title of basilica unless by apostolic grant or from immemorial custom. The Basilica di San Nicola da Tolentino was the first minor basilica to be canonically created, in 1783. The 1917 Code of Canon Law officially recognised churches using the title of basilica from immemorial custom as having such a right to the title of minor basilica. Such churches are referred to as immemorial basilicas.

<doc id="220159" wikidata="Q849418" url="?curid=220159" title="General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party">
<text>The general secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party () is the leader of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the sole ruling party of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). Since 1989, the CCP general secretary has been the paramount leader of the PRC.

According to the CCP constitution, the general secretary is elected during a plenary session of the Central Committee. The general secretary serves as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), China&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; top decision-making body. The general secretary is also the head of the Secretariat, and sets the agenda of Central Committee, Politburo and PSC meetings. Since the 1990s, the holder of the post has been, except for transitional periods, the president of China, making the holder the head of state, and the chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), the supreme commander of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA).

As the leader of the world&#x27;s largest economy by GDP purchasing power parity (PPP), the second largest economy by GDP nominal, the largest military in the world by personnel, a recognized nuclear weapons state, UN Security Council permanent member, and a potential superpower, the general secretary is considered to be one of the world&#x27;s most powerful political figures.

The incumbent general secretary is Xi Jinping, who took office on 15 November 2012 and was re-elected twice on 25 October 2017 and 23 October 2022. The last person to rule the country for more than two terms was Mao Zedong, who served as Chairman of the CCP Central Committee from 1943 until his death in 1976.

== History ==
The post was established by the 12th Central Committee in 1982, replacing the post of Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party. Since its revival in 1982, the post of general secretary has been the highest office in the CCP, though it did not become the most powerful post until Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s retirement in 1990.

Since the mid-1990s, starting with Jiang Zemin, the general secretary has traditionally also held the post of president of China. While the presidency is a ceremonial post, it is customary for the general secretary to assume the presidency to confirm his status as head of state. It has additionally been held together with the post of chairman of the Central Military Commission, making the holder the supreme commander of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army.

== Election ==
The CCP general secretary is nominally elected by a plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party from among the members of the Politburo Standing Committee. In practice, the &quot;de facto&quot; method of selecting the general secretary has varied over time. The two most recent general secretaries, Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping, were first elevated to the position of first Secretary of the Secretariat in the same process used to determine the membership and roles of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee. Under this informal process, the first secretary would be chosen during deliberations by incumbent Politburo members and retired Politburo Standing Committee members in the lead up to a Party Congress. The first secretary would later succeed the retiring general secretary as part of a generational leadership transition at the subsequent party congress.

== Powers and position ==
The powers and roles of the general secretary are vaguely defined, with no term limits or written rules for selecting a successor. However, as China is a one-party state, the general secretary holds ultimate power and authority over state and government, and is usually considered the &quot;paramount leader&quot; of China.

According to the Constitution of the Chinese Communist Party, the general secretary serves as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the Politburo Standing Committee. According to regulations of the CCP, the general secretary is responsible for convening the meetings of the Politburo and the Politburo Standing Committee. The general secretary additionally presides over the work of the Secretariat. The general secretary also sets the topics of Central Committee, Politburo and Politburo Standing Committee meetings. Since October 2017, the first plenary session of the 19th CCP Central Committee, all Politburo members make an annual written presentation to the CCP General Secretary.

<doc id="220160" wikidata="Q45901" url="?curid=220160" title="Thierry Henry">
<text>Thierry Daniel Henry (; born 17 August 1977) is a French professional football coach, pundit, sports broadcaster and former player. He is considered one of the greatest strikers of all time, and one of the greatest players in Premier League history. He has been named by Arsenal as the club&#x27;s greatest ever player. Henry was runner-up for both the Ballon d&#x27;Or in 2003 and the FIFA World Player of the Year in 2003 and 2004. He was named the FWA Footballer of the Year a record three times, the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year a joint-record two times, and was named in the PFA Team of the Year six consecutive times. He was also included in the FIFA FIFPro World XI once and the UEFA Team of the Year five times. In 2004, Henry was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players.

Henry made his professional debut with Monaco in 1994 before signing for defending Serie A champions Juventus. However, limited playing time, coupled with disagreements with the club&#x27;s hierarchy, led to him signing for Premier League club Arsenal for £11 million in 1999. Under long-time mentor and coach Arsène Wenger, Henry became a prolific striker and Arsenal&#x27;s all-time leading scorer with 228 goals in all competitions. He won the Premier League Golden Boot a record four times, won three FA Cups and two Premier League titles with the club, including one during an unbeaten &quot;Invincible&quot; season. Henry spent his final two seasons with Arsenal as club captain, leading them to the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final. Henry transferred to Barcelona in 2007 and in the 2008–09 season, he was a key part of the club&#x27;s historic treble when they won La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League. In 2010, he joined Major League Soccer (MLS) club New York Red Bulls and returned to Arsenal on loan from January to February 2012, before retiring in 2014.

Henry had success with France, winning the 1998 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2000, and 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup. He was named French Player of the Year a record five times, named to the UEFA Euro 2000 Team of the Tournament, awarded both the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and named to the 2006 FIFA World Cup All-Star Team. In October 2007, he became his country&#x27;s record goalscorer, a record he held until December 2022. After amassing 123 appearances and 51 goals, Henry retired from international football after the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

After retiring, Henry transitioned into coaching. He began coaching Arsenal&#x27;s youth teams in February 2015, in tandem with his work as a pundit for Sky Sports. In 2016, he was appointed as an assistant coach at Belgium, before assuming the role as the head coach at Monaco in 2018. He was relieved of his duties at Monaco in January 2019 and returned to MLS less than a year later to manage Montréal Impact. He led Montréal to the playoffs in the 2020 season before departing in 2021, returning to his role as an assistant coach for Belgium for a year and a half.

==Early years==
Henry is of Antillean heritage: his father, Antoine, is from Guadeloupe (La Désirade island), and his mother, Maryse, is from Martinique. He was born and raised in Les Ulis suburb of Paris which, despite sometimes being seen as a tough neighbourhood, provided good footballing facilities. As a seven-year-old, Henry showed great potential, prompting Claude Chezelle to recruit him to the local club CO Les Ulis. His father pressured him to attend training, although the youngster was not particularly drawn to football. He joined US Palaiseau in 1989, but after a year his father fell out with the club, so Henry moved to ES Viry-Châtillon and played there for two years. US Palaiseau coach Jean-Marie Panza, Henry&#x27;s future mentor, followed him there.

==Club career==
===1992–1999: Beginnings at Monaco and transfer to Juventus===
In 1990, Monaco sent scout Arnold Catalano to watch Henry, then at the age of 13, in a match. Henry scored all six goals as his side won 6–0. Catalano asked him to join Monaco without even attending a trial first. Catalano requested that Henry complete a course at the elite INF Clairefontaine academy, and despite the director&#x27;s reluctance to admit Henry due to his poor school results, he was allowed to complete the course and joined Arsène Wenger&#x27;s Monaco as a youth player. Subsequently, Henry signed professional forms with Monaco, and made his professional debut on 31 August 1994, in a 2–0 loss against Nice. Although Wenger suspected that Henry should be deployed as a striker, he put Henry on the left wing because he believed that his pace, natural ball control and skill would be more effective against full backs than centre-backs.

After a tentative start to his Monaco career, Henry was named the French Young Footballer of the Year in 1996, and in the 1996–97 season, his solid performances helped the club win the Ligue 1 title. During the 1997–98 season, he was instrumental in leading his club to the UEFA Champions League semi-final, setting a French record, that was broken since, by scoring seven goals in the competition. By his third season, he had received his first cap for the national team, and was part of the winning team in the 1998 FIFA World Cup. He continued to impress at his tenure with Monaco, and in his five seasons with the club, the young winger scored 20 league goals in 105 appearances.

Henry left Monaco in January 1999, one year before his intimate and closest teammate David Trezeguet, and moved to Italian club Juventus for £10.5 million. He played on the wing, as well as at wing back and wide midfield, but he was ineffective as a goal scorer, struggling against the defensive discipline exhibited by teams in Serie A, registering just three goals in 16 appearances. In 2019, on Jamie Carragher&#x27;s podcast &quot;The Greatest Game&quot;, Henry attributed disagreements with Juve director Luciano Moggi as his rationale behind departing the club.

===1999–2007: Move to Arsenal, breakthrough, and success===
Unsettled in Italy, Henry transferred from Juventus on 3 August 1999 to Arsenal for an estimated fee of £11 million, reuniting with his former manager Arsène Wenger. It was at Arsenal that Henry made his name as a world-class footballer, and although his transfer was not without controversy, Wenger was convinced he was worth the transfer fee. Brought in as a replacement for fellow French forward Nicolas Anelka, Henry was immediately moulded into a striker by Wenger, a move that would pay rich dividends in years to come. However, doubts were raised about his ability to adapt to the quick and physical English game when he failed to score in his first eight games. After several difficult months in England, Henry even conceded that he had to &quot;be re-taught everything about the art of striking.&quot; These doubts were dispelled when he ended his first season at Arsenal with an impressive goal tally of 26. Arsenal finished second in the Premier League behind Manchester United, and lost in the UEFA Cup Final against Galatasaray.

Coming off the back of a victorious UEFA Euro 2000 campaign with the national team, Henry was ready to make an impact in the 2000–01 season. Despite recording fewer goals and assists than his first season, Henry&#x27;s second season with Arsenal proved to be a breakthrough, as he became the club&#x27;s top goalscorer. His goal tally included a spectacular strike against Manchester United where he flicked the ball up (with his back turned to goal), before he swivelled and volleyed in from 20 yards out. The strike also featured a memorable goal celebration where he recreated the Budweiser &quot;Whassup?&quot; advertisement. Armed with one of the league&#x27;s best attacks, Arsenal finished runner-up to perennial rivals Manchester United in the Premier League. The team also reached the final of the FA Cup, losing 2–1 to Liverpool. Henry remained frustrated, however, by the fact that he had yet to help the club win honours, and frequently expressed his desire to establish Arsenal as a powerhouse.

Success finally arrived during the 2001–02 season. Arsenal finished seven points above Liverpool to win the Premier League title, and defeated Chelsea 2–0 in the FA Cup Final. Henry became the league&#x27;s top goalscorer and netted 32 goals in all competitions as he led Arsenal to a double and his first silverware with the club. There was much expectation that Henry would replicate his club form for France during the 2002 FIFA World Cup, but the defending champions suffered a shock exit at the group stage.

2002–03 proved to be another productive season for Henry, as he scored 32 goals in all competitions while contributing 23 assists—remarkable returns for a striker. In doing so, he led Arsenal to another FA Cup triumph (where he was man-of-the-match in the Final), although Arsenal failed to retain their Premier League title. Throughout the season, he competed with Manchester United&#x27;s Ruud van Nistelrooy for the league scoring title, but the Dutchman edged Henry to the Golden Boot by a single goal. Nonetheless, Henry was named both the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year. His rising status as one of the world&#x27;s best footballers was affirmed when he emerged runner-up for the 2003 FIFA World Player of the Year award. With 24 goals and 20 assists in the league, Henry set a new record for most assists in a single Premier League season, and also became the first player in history to record at least 20 goals and 20 assists in a single season in one of Europe&#x27;s top–five leagues—this feat has since been matched by Lionel Messi in 2020.

Entering the 2003–04 season, Arsenal were determined to reclaim the Premier League crown. Henry was again instrumental in Arsenal&#x27;s exceptionally successful campaign; together with the likes of Dennis Bergkamp, Patrick Vieira, Freddie Ljungberg and Robert Pires, Henry ensured that the Gunners became the first team in more than a century to go through the entire domestic league season unbeaten, claiming the league title in the process. Apart from being named for the second year running as the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year, Henry emerged once again as the runner-up for 2004 FIFA World Player of the Year award. With 39 goals scored in all competitions, the Frenchman led the league in goals scored and won the European Golden Boot. However, as was the case in 2002, Henry was unable to lead the national side to honours during UEFA Euro 2004.

This dip in success was compounded when Arsenal failed again to secure back-to-back league titles when they lost out to Chelsea in the 2004–05 season, although Arsenal did win the FA Cup (the Final of which Henry missed through injury). Henry maintained his reputation as one of Europe&#x27;s most feared strikers as he led the league in scoring, and with 31 goals in all competitions, he was the co-recipient (with Diego Forlán) of the European Golden Boot, becoming the first player to officially win the award twice in a row (Ally McCoist had won two Golden Boots in a row, but both were deemed unofficial). The unexpected departure of Arsenal&#x27;s captain Patrick Vieira in the 2005 close season led to Henry being awarded club captaincy, a role which many felt was not naturally suited for him; the captaincy is more commonly given to defenders or midfielders, who are better-placed on the pitch to read the game. Along with being chief goalscorer, he was responsible for leading a very young team which had yet to gel fully.

The 2005–06 season proved to be one of remarkable personal achievements for Henry. On 17 October 2005, Henry became the club&#x27;s top goalscorer of all time; two goals against Sparta Prague in the Champions League meant he broke Ian Wright&#x27;s record of 185 goals. On 1 February 2006, he scored a goal against West Ham United, bringing his league goal tally up to 151, breaking Arsenal legend Cliff Bastin&#x27;s league goals record. Henry scored his 100th league goal at Highbury, a feat unparalleled in the history of the club, and a unique achievement in the Premier League. On the final day of the Premier League season, Henry scored a hat-trick against Wigan Athletic in the last match played at Highbury. He completed the season as the league&#x27;s top goalscorer, was voted the FWA Footballer of the Year for the third time in his career, and was selected in the FIFA World XI.

Nevertheless, Arsenal failed to win the Premier League title again, but hopes of a trophy were revived when Arsenal reached the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final. The Gunners eventually lost 2–1 to Barcelona, with Henry assisting the team&#x27;s only goal from a free kick, and Arsenal&#x27;s inability to win the league title for two consecutive seasons combined with the relative inexperience of the Arsenal squad caused much speculation that Henry would leave for another club. However, he declared his love for the club and accepted a four-year contract, and said he would stay at Arsenal for life. Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein later claimed the club had turned down two bids of £50 million from Spanish clubs for Henry before the signing of the new contract. Had the transfer materialised, it would have surpassed the then-world record £47 million paid for Zinedine Zidane.

Henry&#x27;s 2006–07 season was marred by injuries. Although he scored 10 goals in 17 domestic appearances for Arsenal, Henry&#x27;s season was cut short in February. Having missed games due to hamstring, foot, and back problems, he was deemed fit enough to come on as a late substitute against PSV in a Champions League match, but began limping shortly after coming on. Scans the next day revealed that he would need at least three months to heal from new groin and stomach injuries, missing the rest of the 2006–07 season. Wenger attributed Henry&#x27;s injuries to a protracted 2005–06 campaign, and reiterated that Henry was keen on staying with the Gunners to rebuild for the 2007–08 season.

===2007–2010: Barcelona and a historic treble===
On 25 June 2007, in an unexpected turn of events, Henry was transferred to Barcelona for €24 million. He signed a four-year deal for a reported €6.8 (£4.6) million per season. It was revealed that the contract included a release clause of €125 (£84.9) million. Henry cited the departure of Dein and continued uncertainty over Wenger&#x27;s future as reasons for leaving, and maintained that &quot;I always said that if I ever left Arsenal it would be to play for Barcelona.&quot; Despite their captain&#x27;s departure, Arsenal got off to an impressive start for the 2007–08 campaign, and Henry said that his presence in the team might have been more of a hindrance than a help. He stated, &quot;Because of my seniority, the fact that I was captain and my habit of screaming for the ball, they would sometimes give it to me even when I was not in the best position. So in that sense it was good for the team that I moved on.&quot; Henry left Arsenal as the club&#x27;s leading all-time league goalscorer with 174 goals and leading all-time goalscorer in European competitions with 42 goals; in July 2008, Arsenal fans voted him as Arsenal&#x27;s greatest player ever in Arsenal.com&#x27;s Gunners&#x27; Greatest 50 Players poll.

At Barcelona, Henry was given the number 14 jersey, the same as he had worn at Arsenal. He scored his first goal for his new club on 19 September 2007 in a 3–0 Champions League group stage win over Lyon, and he recorded his first hat-trick for Barça in a Primera División match against Levante ten days later. But with Henry mostly deployed on the wing throughout the season, he was unable to reproduce the goal-scoring form he achieved with Arsenal. He expressed dissatisfaction with the move to Barcelona in the initial year, amidst widespread speculation of a return to the Premier League. In an interview with Garth Crooks on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Football Focus&quot;, Henry described missing life &quot;back home&quot; and even &quot;the English press.&quot; However, Henry concluded his debut season as the club&#x27;s top scorer with 19 goals in addition to nine league assists, second behind Lionel Messi&#x27;s ten.

Henry went on to surpass this tally in a more integrated 2008–09 campaign, with 26 goals and 10 assists from the left wing. He won the first trophy of his Barcelona career on 13 May 2009 when Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final. Barcelona won the Primera División and UEFA Champions League soon after, completing a treble for the Frenchman, who had combined with Messi and Samuel Eto&#x27;o to score 100 goals between them that season. The trio was also the most prolific trio in Spanish league history, scoring 72 goals and surpassing the 66 goals of Real Madrid&#x27;s Ferenc Puskás, Alfredo Di Stéfano and Luis del Sol of the 1960–61 season (this was later surpassed by Real Madrid trio Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gonzalo Higuaín who scored 89 goals in 2011–12). Later in 2009, Henry helped Barcelona win an unprecedented sextuple, consisting of the aforementioned treble, the Supercopa de España, the UEFA Super Cup, and the FIFA Club World Cup.

The following season, the emergence of Pedro meant that Henry only started 15 league games. Before the La Liga season ended, and with a year still left on his contract, club president Joan Laporta stated on 5 May 2010 that Henry &quot;may go away in the summer transfer window if that&#x27;s what he wants.&quot; After Henry returned from the 2010 World Cup, Barcelona confirmed that they had agreed to the sale of Henry to an unnamed club, with the player still to agree terms with the new club.

===2010–2014: New York Red Bulls and retirement===
In July 2010, Henry signed a multi-year contract with Major League Soccer (MLS) club New York Red Bulls for the 2010 season as its second designated player. He made his full MLS debut on 31 July in a 2–2 draw against Houston Dynamo, assisting both goals to Juan Pablo Ángel. His first MLS goal came on 28 August in a 2–0 victory against San Jose Earthquakes. The Red Bulls eventually topped the MLS Eastern Conference by one point over Columbus Crew before losing 3–2 on aggregate against San Jose Earthquakes in the quarter-finals of the 2010 MLS Cup Playoffs. The next season, the Red Bulls were 10th overall in the league, and bowed out in the Conference semi-finals of the 2011 MLS Cup Playoffs. By 2011, Henry had a non-contractual sponsorship agreement with Dietrich Mateschitz&#x27;s Red Bull GmbH, and was claimed by the company as a member of the Red Bull &quot;family&quot;.

====Return to Arsenal (loan)====
After training with Arsenal during the MLS off-season, Henry re-signed for the club on a two-month loan deal on 6 January 2012. This was to provide cover for Gervinho and Marouane Chamakh, who were unavailable due to their participation in the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations. Henry was given the number 12 jersey – his old Arsenal number 14 jersey, the same number he wore at Barcelona and New York, was unavailable, with Theo Walcott inheriting it following Henry&#x27;s departure from the club in 2007. Henry made his second Arsenal debut as a substitute against Leeds United in the FA Cup third round and scored the only goal. In his last league game on loan, he scored the winning goal in stoppage time in a 2–1 win against Sunderland. His final goals for the club meant he finished his Arsenal career with a record 228 goals; 175 of them came in the Premier League.

====Return to New York Red Bulls====
On 17 February 2012, Henry returned to Red Bulls to prepare for the 2012 season. His base salary of $5 million ($5.6 million guaranteed) made him the highest-paid player in MLS—surpassing David Beckham, who had taken a salary cut for his last year with the Los Angeles Galaxy. In 2013, Henry&#x27;s base salary dropped to $3.75 million setting him behind Robbie Keane&#x27;s $4 million base salary. With bonuses, however, Henry remained the highest-paid player with $4.35 million compared to Keane&#x27;s $4.33 million.

On 31 March 2012, Henry scored his first MLS hat-trick in a 5–2 Red Bulls win over the Montreal Impact. He was named MLS Player of the Month that same month. On 27 October 2013, Henry scored once and provided two assists in the last game of the season against the Chicago Fire at Red Bull Arena to help his team win 5–2 and become champions of the regular season. It was the club&#x27;s first major trophy in their 17-year history.

On 12 July 2014, Henry provided a goal and three assists in a 4–1 Red Bulls win over the Columbus Crew. With that effort he became the all-time assist leader for the New York Red Bulls with 37, surpassing Amado Guevara and Tab Ramos.

On 1 December 2014, it was announced that Henry had left the Red Bulls after four and a half years at the club. On 16 December, he announced his retirement as a player and stated that he would begin working for Sky Sports as a pundit. After working at Sky for over three years, Henry quit his position in July 2018 to focus on his career as a coach.

==International career==

Henry enjoyed a successful career with the France national team, winning the first of his 123 caps in June 1997, when his good form for Monaco was rewarded with a call-up to the Under-20 French national team, where he played in the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship alongside future teammates William Gallas and David Trezeguet. Within four months, France head coach Aimé Jacquet called Henry up to the senior team. The 20-year-old made his senior international debut on 11 October 1997 in a 2–1 win against South Africa. Jacquet was so impressed with Henry that he took him to the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Although Henry was a largely unknown quantity at international level, he ended the tournament as France&#x27;s top scorer with three goals. He was scheduled to appear as a substitute in the final, where France beat Brazil 3–0, but Marcel Desailly&#x27;s sending off forced a defensive change instead. In 1998, he was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour, France&#x27;s highest decoration.

Henry was a member of France&#x27;s UEFA Euro 2000 squad, again scoring three goals in the tournament, including the equaliser against Portugal in the semi-final, and finishing as the country&#x27;s top scorer. France later won the game in extra time following a converted penalty kick by Zinedine Zidane. France went on to defeat Italy in extra-time in the final, earning Henry his second major international medal. During the tournament, Henry was voted man of the match in three games, including the final against Italy.

The 2002 FIFA World Cup featured a stunning early exit for both Henry and France as the defending champions were eliminated in the group stage after failing to score a goal in all three games. France lost against Senegal in their first group match and Henry was red carded for a dangerous sliding challenge in their next match against Uruguay. In that game, France played to a 0–0 draw, but Henry was forced to miss the final group match due to suspension; France lost 2–0 to Denmark.

Henry returned to form for his country at the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup. Despite playing without team stalwarts Zidane and Patrick Vieira, France won, in large part owing to Henry&#x27;s outstanding play, for which he was named Man of the Match by FIFA&#x27;s Technical Study Group in three of France&#x27;s five matches. In the final, he scored the golden goal in extra time to lift the title for the host country after a 1–0 victory over Cameroon. Henry was awarded both the Adidas Golden Ball as the outstanding player of the competition and the Adidas Golden Shoe as the tournament&#x27;s top goalscorer with four goals.

In UEFA Euro 2004, Henry played in all of France&#x27;s matches and scored two goals. France beat England in the group stage but lost to the eventual winners Greece 1–0 in the quarter-finals. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup Henry remained as one of the automatic starters in the squad. He played as a lone striker, but despite an indifferent start to the tournament, became one of the top players of the World Cup. He scored three goals, including the winning goal from Zidane&#x27;s free kick against defending champions Brazil in the quarter-final. However, France subsequently lost to Italy on penalties (5–3) in the final. Henry did not take part in the penalty shoot-out, having been substituted in extra time after his legs had cramped. Henry was one of ten nominees for the Golden Ball award for Player of the Tournament, an award which was ultimately presented to his teammate, Zidane and was named a starting striker on the 2006 FIFPro World XI team.

On 13 October 2007, Henry scored his 41st goal against the Faroe Islands, joining Michel Platini as the country&#x27;s top goalscorer of all time. Four days later at the Stade de la Beaujoire, he scored a late double against Lithuania, thereby setting a new record as France&#x27;s top goalscorer. On 3 June 2008, Henry made his 100th appearance for the national team in a match against Colombia, becoming the sixth French player ever to reach that milestone.

Henry missed the opening game of France&#x27;s short-lived UEFA Euro 2008 campaign, where they were eliminated in the group stages after being drawn in the same group as Italy, the Netherlands and Romania. He scored France&#x27;s only goal in the competition in a 4–1 loss to the Netherlands.

The French team struggled during the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers and finished second in their group behind Serbia. During the play-offs against the Republic of Ireland, Henry was involved in a controversy in the second leg of the game at the Stade de France on 18 November 2009. With the aggregate score tied at 1–1 and the game in extra time, he used his hand twice to control the ball before delivering a cross to William Gallas who scored the winner. This sparked a barrage of criticism against the Frenchman, while national team coach Raymond Domenech and Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger defended him. The Football Association of Ireland lodged a formal complaint with FIFA, seeking a replay of the game, which FIFA declined. Henry said that he contemplated retiring from international football after the reactions to the incident, but maintained that he was not a &quot;cheat&quot;; hours after FIFA had ruled out a replay, he stated that &quot;the fairest solution would be to replay the game&quot;. FIFA President Sepp Blatter described the incident as &quot;blatant unfair play&quot; and announced an inquiry into how such incidents could be avoided in future, and added that the incident would be investigated by the Disciplinary Committee. Blatter also said Henry told him that his family had been threatened in the aftermath of the incident. In January 2010, FIFA announced that there was no legal basis to sanction Henry.

Henry did not feature in the starting line-up for France at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. France drew in their first game against Uruguay, and lost 2–0 in their second against Mexico. The team was thrown into disarray when Nicolas Anelka was expelled from the team, and captain Patrice Evra led a team protest by refusing to train. In the final group game against host-nation South Africa in which Henry came on as a second-half substitute, France lost 2–1 and were eliminated from the tournament. He then announced his retirement from international football, having won 123 caps and scored 51 goals for &quot;Les Bleus&quot;, thus finishing his international career as France&#x27;s all-time top scorer, and second most capped player after Lilian Thuram.

==Style of play==
Although Henry played up front as a striker during his youth, he spent his time at Monaco and Juventus playing on the wing. When Henry joined Arsenal in 1999, Wenger immediately changed this, switching Henry to his childhood position, often pairing him with Dutch veteran Dennis Bergkamp. During the 2004–05 season, Wenger switched Arsenal&#x27;s formation to 4–5–1. This change forced Henry to adapt again to fit into the Arsenal team, and he played many games as a lone striker. Still, Henry remained Arsenal&#x27;s main offensive threat, on many occasions conjuring spectacular goals. Wenger said of his fellow Frenchman: &quot;Thierry Henry could take the ball in the middle of the park and score a goal that no one else in the world could score&quot;.

One of the reasons cited for Henry&#x27;s impressive play up front is his ability to calmly score from one-on-ones. According to his father Antoine, Henry learned precision shooting from watching his idol Marco van Basten. He was also influenced by Romário, Ronaldo and Liberian star George Weah, a new breed of strikers in the 1990s who would also operate outside the penalty area before running with the ball towards goal. At his physical peak from the late 1990s to the mid 2000s, Henry&#x27;s ability to dribble past opponents with exceptional pace, skill and composure, meant that he could get in behind defenders regularly enough to score. In 2004, former Arsenal striker Alan Smith commented on Henry: &quot;I have to say I haven&#x27;t seen a player like him. He&#x27;s an athlete with great technical ability and a tremendous desire to be the best.&quot;

When up front, Henry is occasionally known to move out wide to the left wing position, something which enables him to contribute heavily in assists: between 2002–03 and 2004–05, the striker managed almost 50 assists in total and this was attributed to his unselfish play and creativity. Ranking Henry the greatest player in Premier League history, in February 2020 &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; magazine stated, &quot;No one assisted more in a season. No one has terrorised defenders with such a combination of bewitching grace and phenomenal power.&quot;

Coming in from the left, Henry&#x27;s trademark finish saw him place the ball inside the far right corner of the goal. Henry would also drift offside to fool the defence then run back onside before the ball is played and beat the offside trap, although he never provided Arsenal a distinct aerial threat. Given his versatility in being able to operate as both a winger and a striker, the Frenchman is not a prototypical &quot;out-and-out striker&quot;, but he has emerged consistently as one of Europe&#x27;s most prolific strikers. In set pieces, Henry was the first-choice penalty and free kick taker for Arsenal, scoring regularly from those situations. Henry was also a notable exponent of a no-look pass where he would feint to pass the ball with his right foot, but would make contact with the ball using his standing foot (his left).

==Managerial career==
===Arsenal youth===
Henry began coaching Arsenal&#x27;s youth teams in February 2015, in tandem with his work for Sky Sports. His influence on the team was praised by players such as Alex Iwobi, who dedicated a goal against Bayern Munich in the 2015–16 UEFA Youth League to his advice. Having earned a UEFA A Licence, he was offered the job of under-18 coach by Academy head Andries Jonker, but the decision was overruled by Wenger, who wanted a full-time coach for the team.

===Belgium (assistant)===
In August 2016, Henry became second assistant coach of the Belgium national team, working alongside head coach Roberto Martínez and fellow assistant Graeme Jones. In an interview with NBC Sports, Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku praised Henry for his work with him, stating, &quot;Henry is the best thing that has happened to me because since I came to England aged 18 I have had the best mentors. Thierry for me is the best. Every day whether it is positive and negative I take it in my stride because I know what is expected from the top level.&quot; At the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Belgium reached the semi-final, but lost to Henry&#x27;s home nation France 1–0. Henry picked up a Bronze medal after Belgium defeated England 2–0 in the third-place play-off to secure their best ever World Cup finish.

Henry was reportedly offered the position of head coach by Bordeaux in August 2018. However, he declined the offer after disagreements with the club&#x27;s owners. Days after turning down the Bordeaux job, and following Jones&#x27;s departure from the Belgium national team, Henry, who had been the forwards coach, was promoted to Belgium assistant coach. However, his tenure in the role was short-lived, after he accepted the role as head coach at former club Monaco in October.

===Monaco===
On 11 October 2018, Monaco dismissed Leonardo Jardim as club manager. Jardim&#x27;s position had become untenable after struggling heavily in domestic competition, with the club 18th at the time of his departure, and disputes over the club&#x27;s transfer policy. Monaco&#x27;s search for a new coach coincided with the regulatory mid-season international break, allowing the club sufficient time to search for a replacement, however, they quickly decided on Henry, and he was appointed a mere two days later. He signed a three-year deal, and was unveiled as Monaco manager on 18 October. At his first press conference, he told reporters: &quot;This club will always have a big place in my heart, so to be able to come here and start again, it is a dream come true. There is a lot of work to do, as you can imagine – but I am more than happy to be here&quot;.

Henry&#x27;s arrival at Monaco was greeted with mixed reactions by some media outlets, due to his relative inexperience as a top-level coach and the task of overturning Monaco&#x27;s misfortunes. Despite inheriting a squad of sub-standard quality, Henry expressed a desire of replicating the football he played under Pep Guardiola at Barcelona, as well as instilling the &quot;professionalism&quot; taught to him by Arsène Wenger. Henry also adopted a hands-on approach to training sessions, being regularly involved in devising schemes and instructing drills. His first match was a 2–1 away defeat against Strasbourg on 20 October. He was unable to secure a win for over a month, enduring a period which included two high-profile defeats against Club Brugge and Paris Saint-Germain, prior to defeating Caen on 1–0 on 25 November. He secured two wins in December, defeating Amiens in the league and Lorient in the Coupe de la Ligue, however, this was on the backdrop of three additional Ligue 1 defeats to close 2018 in the relegation zone.

In January 2019, Henry entered the winter transfer window, where he signed left-back Fodé Ballo-Touré, and former Arsenal teammate Cesc Fàbregas from Chelsea. He also sanctioned the loan signing of French defensive midfielder William Vainqueur on 12 January, and experienced defender Naldo. However, these signings would not turn around the club&#x27;s fate, and on 24 January, Henry was dismissed at Monaco. The club were 19th at the time of his departure, and Henry left with a record of 4 wins, 5 draws, and 11 defeats, from 20 games in charge.

===Montreal Impact===
On 14 November 2019, Henry became manager of Major League Soccer side Montreal Impact, signing a two-year deal until the end of the 2021 season with an option to extend it by a year until the 2022 season. In his first press conference, Henry stated he had to &quot;confront&quot; the relative disappointment of his short stint as manager of Monaco, before undertaking a new job.

After leading Montreal to their first playoff berth in four seasons, on 25 February 2021, prior to the 2021 season, Henry stepped down as head coach of the renamed CF Montréal to be closer to his children in London. He had not been able to see them in the 2020 season due to travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, and with restrictions continuing into the 2021 season, he decided to end the separation.

===Return to Belgium (assistant)===
In May 2021, Henry rejoined the coaching staff of Belgium prior to UEFA Euro 2020. He was also in the team&#x27;s coaching staff for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. In February 2023, upon the appointment of Domenico Tedesco as Belgium&#x27;s new head coach, Royal Belgian Football Association CEO Peter Bossaert announced that Henry would not be returning to the national team&#x27;s coaching staff.

Henry was considered as being one of potential replacements for Corinne Diacre who got fired as France women&#x27;s national team head coach, but he rejected the approach.

===France U21 and Olympic===
On 21 August 2023, Henry was named as the new manager of the France national under-21 team, meaning that he would also coach the France Olympic team at the 2024 Summer Games. He coached the Olympic team to a silver medal, losing the final to Spain, before announcing his resignation as coach of the under-21s on 19 August 2024.

==Media and broadcasting career==
After leaving Montreal, Henry resumed his punditry career. He joined CBS Sports in their UEFA Champions League coverage as studio analyst on 27 September 2021, as well as being hired by Amazon Prime Video for their Premier League and Ligue 1 programs as consultant.

==Reception==
Henry has received many plaudits and awards in his football career. He was runner-up for the 2003 and 2004 FIFA World Player of the Year awards; in those two seasons, he also won back-to-back PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year titles. Henry is the only player ever to have won the FWA Footballer of the Year three times (2003, 2004, 2006), and the French Player of the Year on a record four occasions. Henry was voted into the Premier League Overseas Team of the Decade in the 10 Seasons Awards poll in 2003, and in 2004 he was named by football legend Pelé on the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players.

In terms of goal-scoring awards, Henry was the European Golden Boot winner in 2004 and 2005 (sharing it with Villarreal&#x27;s Diego Forlán in 2005). Henry was also the top goalscorer in the Premier League for a record four seasons (2002, 2004, 2005, 2006). In 2006, he became the first player to score more than 20 goals in the league for five consecutive seasons (2002 to 2006). With 175, Henry is currently seventh in the list of all-time Premier League goalscorers, behind Alan Shearer, Wayne Rooney, Harry Kane, Andy Cole, Sergio Agüero, and Frank Lampard. He held the record for most goals in the competition for one club, until it was broken by Rooney in 2016, and held the record for most goals by a foreign player in the competition until surpassed by Agüero in 2020. France&#x27;s all-time record goalscorer was, in his prime in the mid 2000s, regarded by many coaches, footballers and journalists as one of the best players in the world. In November 2007, he was ranked 33rd on the Association of Football Statisticians&#x27; compendium for &quot;Greatest Ever Footballers&quot;.

Arsenal fans honoured their former player in 2008, declaring Henry the greatest Arsenal player. In two other 2008 surveys, Henry emerged as the favourite Premier League player of all time among 32,000 people surveyed in the Barclays 2008 Global Fan Report. Arsenal fan and The Who lead singer Roger Daltrey mentions Henry in the tribute song &quot;Highbury Highs&quot;, which he performed at Arsenal&#x27;s last game at Highbury on 7 May 2006. On 10 December 2011, Arsenal unveiled a bronze statue of Henry at the Emirates Stadium as part of its 125th anniversary celebrations. In 2017, &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; magazine ranked him first in their list of the 30 best strikers in Premier League history. Daniel Girard of &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; described Henry as &quot;one of the best players of his generation&quot; in 2010. Henry&#x27;s former Arsenal manager, Wenger, described him as &quot;one of the greatest players [he had] ever seen&quot; in 2014. In 2019, &quot;The Independent&quot; ranked Henry in first place in their list of the &quot;100 greatest Premier League players&quot;.

==Personal life==
Henry married English model Nicole Merry, real name Claire, on 5 July 2003. The ceremony was held at Highclere Castle, and on 27 May 2005 the couple celebrated the birth of their first child, Téa. Henry dedicated his first goal following Téa&#x27;s birth to her by holding his fingers in a &quot;T&quot; shape and kissing them after scoring in a match against Newcastle United. When Henry was still at Arsenal, he also purchased a home in Hampstead, North London. Shortly after his transfer to Barcelona, it was announced that Henry and his wife would divorce; the decree nisi was granted in September 2007, &quot;on the basis of his behavior&quot;. Their separation concluded in December 2008 when Henry paid Merry a divorce settlement close to her requested sum of £10 million.

Henry has been with his second wife, Andrea Rajačić, since 2011. They have three children together.

In January 2024, Henry said he had been depressed throughout his career, and that his father had been a demanding presence when he was young.

===Interest in basketball===
As a fan of the National Basketball Association (NBA), Henry is often seen with his friend Tony Parker at games when not playing football. Henry stated in an interview that he admires basketball, as it is similar to football in pace and excitement. Having made regular trips to the NBA Finals in the past, he went to watch Parker and the San Antonio Spurs in the 2007 NBA Finals; and in the 2001 NBA Finals, he went to Philadelphia to help with French television coverage of the Finals as well as to watch Allen Iverson, whom he named as one of his favourite players.

===Appearance on screen===
Henry makes a short cameo appearance in the 2015 film &quot;Entourage&quot;. Henry&#x27;s part sees him walking a dog and having exchange with Ari Gold (character played by Jeremy Piven), who is an over-the-top Hollywood agent. He makes a number of cameo appearances playing himself in the Apple TV+ football comedy series &quot;Ted Lasso&quot;.

Henry makes a number of appearances in the Amazon Original sports docuseries &quot;All or Nothing: Arsenal&quot;, which documented the club by spending time with the coaching staff and players behind the scenes both on and off the field throughout their 2021–22 season.

===Social causes===
Henry is a member of the UNICEF-FIFA squad, where together with other professional footballers he appeared in a series of TV spots seen by hundreds of millions of fans around the world during the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups. In these spots, the players promote football as a game that must be played on behalf of children.
Having been subjected to racism in the past, Henry is an active spokesperson against racism in football. The most prominent incident of racism against Henry was during a training session with the Spanish national team in 2004, when a Spanish TV crew caught coach Luis Aragonés referring to Henry as &quot;black shit&quot; to José Antonio Reyes, Henry&#x27;s teammate at Arsenal. The incident caused an uproar in the British media, and there were calls for Aragonés to be sacked. Henry and Nike started the Stand Up Speak Up campaign against racism in football as a result of the incident. Subsequently, in 2007, &quot;Time&quot; featured him as one of the &quot;Heroes &amp; Pioneers&quot; on the &quot;Time&quot; 100 list of the most influential people in the world.

Along with 45 other football players, Henry took part in FIFA&#x27;s &quot;Live for Love United&quot; in 2002. The single was released in tandem with the 2002 FIFA World Cup and its proceeds went towards AIDS research. Henry also supports the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and Cystic Fibrosis Trust.

Henry has also played in charity football games for various causes. In June 2018, he reunited with his France 1998 World Cup winning teammates to play a charity game against an All-Star team which included Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, with proceeds going to the Mecenet Cardiac Charity and the Children of the World fund. In a 3–2 win for France, Henry played a trademark no-look one-two pass with Zinedine Zidane before scoring with a 20-yard curling strike.

===Commercial endorsements===
In 2006, Henry was valued as the ninth-most commercially marketable footballer in the world, and throughout his career he has signed many endorsements and appeared in commercials.

====Sportswear====
At the beginning of his career, Henry signed with sportswear giant Nike. In the buildup to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, Henry featured in Nike&#x27;s &quot;Secret Tournament&quot; advertisement, directed by Terry Gilliam, along with 24 superstar football players. In a 2004 advertisement, Henry pits his wits against others footballers in locations such as his bedroom and living room, which was partly inspired by Henry himself, who revealed that he always has a football nearby, even at home. In tandem with the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Henry also featured in Nike&#x27;s &quot;Joga Bonito&quot; campaign, Portuguese for &quot;beautiful game&quot;.

Henry&#x27;s deal with Nike ended after the 2006 FIFA World Cup, when he signed a deal with Reebok to appear in their &quot;I Am What I Am&quot; campaign. As part of Reebok Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Framed&quot; series, Henry was the star of a half-hour episode that detailed the making of a commercial about himself directed by Spanish actress Paz Vega. In 2011, Henry switched to Puma boots.

====Others====
Henry featured in the Renault Clio advertisements in which he popularised the term &quot;va-va-voom&quot;, meaning &quot;life&quot; or &quot;passion&quot;. His romantic interest in the commercial was his then-girlfriend, later his wife (now divorced), Claire Merry. &quot;Va-va-voom&quot; was subsequently added to the &quot;Concise Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.

In February 2007, Henry was named as one of the three global ambassadors of Gillette&#x27;s &quot;Champions Program&quot;, which purported to feature three of the &quot;best-known, most widely respected and successful athletes competing today&quot; and also showcased Roger Federer and Tiger Woods in a series of television commercials. In reaction to the handball controversy following the France vs Ireland 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier, Gillette faced a boycott and accusations of doctoring French versions of their Champions poster, but subsequently released a statement backing Henry.

Henry was part of Pepsi&#x27;s &quot;Dare For More&quot; campaign in 2005, alongside the likes of David Beckham and Ronaldinho. He starred in a 2014 advert for Beats headphones with other global football stars including Neymar and Luis Suárez, with the theme of &quot;The Game Before the Game&quot; and the players pre-game ritual of listening to music.

Henry featured on the front cover of the editions of EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series from &quot;FIFA 2001&quot; to &quot;FIFA 2005&quot;. He was included as an icon to the Ultimate Team in &quot;FIFA 18&quot;. He was also a cover star for the Konami &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer&quot; video game series, and was featured on the covers of &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer 4&quot; to &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer 6&quot;.

===Other interests===
In August 2022, Serie B club Como announced Henry has joined them as an investor and minority stakeholder.

<text>The Bouncing Souls are an American punk rock band from New Brunswick, New Jersey, formed in 1989. By the time of their acknowledgment by the national punk rock scene, they had reignited a &quot;pogo&quot; element to New Jersey punk rock by playing fast light-hearted songs, a model followed by various other local bands.

==History==
The four original members grew up in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, and played in smaller bands while attending Ridge High School. Although they decided to forgo college, they made the decision to move to a college town; New Brunswick, NJ, which is the home of Rutgers University. New Brunswick had a reputation for supporting underground music, and over the years had seen not only musical acts but actors enjoy professional success. The Bouncing Souls not only became a staple in the New Brunswick music scene, but also helped other bands gain an audience by opening up for them in the clubs around town, as well as parties and shows they put on themselves. The band&#x27;s name is a derivative of Doc Martens shoes, specifically their advertising slogan &quot;with Bouncing Soles&quot;. Doctor Martens air-cushioned soles are a staple of punk dress.

Their first full-length album, &quot;The Good, The Bad &amp; The Argyle&quot;, was released in 1994 on Chunksaah Records, their own label. The album was a compilation of several EPs the band had released previously. Two tracks of this record, &quot;Candy&quot; (popularized by the Strangeloves and covered by many other groups) and &quot;What Boys Like&quot; (originally by the Waitresses) served as homage to 1980s new wave while simultaneously striking a humorous jab at homophobia. Their next album, &quot;Maniacal Laughter&quot;, was released in 1996. Half the album was written in a week. It led to a high-profile tour with Youth Brigade that got the attention of Epitaph Records.

The Bouncing Souls signed with Epitaph in 1997 and released &quot;The Bouncing Souls&quot; later that year. While it contains some Bouncing Souls classics like &quot;Cracked&quot;, &quot;Kate is Great&quot;, and &quot;East Coast Fuck You!&quot;, certain tracks on the record are anticlimactic in comparison to their lo-fi earlier recordings. Greg himself stated on &quot;Do You Remember? 15 Years of the Bouncing Souls&quot; that &quot;It&#x27;s a CD of unfinished songs&quot;. &quot;Hopeless Romantic&quot; followed in 1999. &quot;Hopeless Romantic&quot; has been heralded for admixing poignant lyrics with their melodic rapidly paced punk style. Soon after the album&#x27;s release, personal problems arose between the band and long-time drummer Shal Khichi which resulted in his departure from the band. He was replaced by former Skinnerbox, Mephiskapheles, and Murphy&#x27;s Law drummer, Michael McDermott.

&quot;How I Spent My Summer Vacation&quot; was the first album released with the new line-up. By now, the band had become viewed as seminal to the modern punk sound, with a new generation of fans discovering their earlier releases as they toured with newer bands as well as larger punk acts such as Hot Water Music. 2002 brought a b-sides album, &quot;The Bad, the Worse, and the Out of Print&quot;, and an acclaimed split with Anti-Flag as part of the &quot;BYO Split Series&quot;. In 2003, the band released their sixth album &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;, as well as their first DVD, &quot;Do You Remember? 15 Years of the Bouncing Souls&quot;. In 2005, they had two live releases, a double CD album, simply titled &quot;Live&quot;, as well as a DVD, titled &quot;Live at the Glasshouse&quot;, which was the 19th entry in Kung Fu Films&#x27; &quot;The Show Must Go Off!&quot; series. The band released their seventh album, &quot;The Gold Record&quot;, on June 6, 2006, or 6/6/06, which the band has called &quot;The release of the beast&quot;, in reference to 666, which is known as &quot;The number of the beast&quot;. Also, due to their first full-length record being a collection of previous releases, many fans also consider this to in fact be their sixth studio album, and thus 666 is also partly in reference to this. They then headed out on the 2006 Warped Tour in support of the record, and again three years later, in 2009.

In 2008, while at the Vans Warped Tour stop in their home state of New Jersey, the band helped Music Saves Lives raise the blood supply by signing a guitar for the non-profit to auction off.

In 2009, the band released a series of sixteen digital songs and four 7-inch EPs as part of the &quot;20th Anniversary Series&quot;. Twelve of these songs were being released into an album titled &quot;Ghosts on the Boardwalk&quot; which was released on January 12, 2010. In 2011, the band was the first to be featured on SideOneDummy&#x27;s The Complete Control Sessions series of live recordings. The band&#x27;s contribution to the series features six songs, one of which is a Misfits cover.

The Bouncing Souls released their ninth studio album, &quot;Comet&quot; on June 12, 2012, via Rise Records, their first album for that label. The artwork and track listing was released on March 12, 2012, along with the album&#x27;s third track, &quot;Static,&quot; which is available to be streamed online.

On 25 June 2013, the Bouncing Souls confirmed that drummer Michael McDermott would be leaving the band in order to &#x27;pursue other musical interests&#x27;. The band later added they don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s next for them, whilst suggesting the remaining members will continue performing in the band. McDermott would later join Joan Jett &amp; the Blackhearts.

On September 26, 2013, George Rebelo of Hot Water Music and Against Me! officially joined the band as the new drummer during a secret show at Asbury Lanes.

The band released their tenth studio album, &quot;Simplicity&quot; on July 29, 2016. On March 15, 2019, the band released the six-song &quot;Crucial Moments&quot; EP along with a new book to celebrate the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary.

On October 23, 2020, the Bouncing Souls released their eleventh studio album, &quot;Volume 2&quot;. The album contains songs from their previous records re-recorded in new styles, along with a new song, &quot;World on Fire.&quot;

The band released their twelfth studio album, &quot;Ten Stories High&quot;, on March 24, 2023. It marked the first time since 2016&#x27;s &quot;Simplicity&quot; that the band released a full-length studio album of newly recorded original material.

<text>Mount Lycabettus (), also known as Lycabettos, Lykabettos or Lykavittos (, ), is a Cretaceous limestone hill in the Greek capital Athens. At 277 meters (908 feet) above sea level, its summit is the highest point in Central Athens and pine trees cover its base. The name also refers to the residential neighbourhood immediately below the east of the hill.

The hill is a tourist destination and can be ascended by the Lycabettus Funicular, a funicular railway which climbs the hill from a lower terminus at Kolonaki (The railway station is at Aristippou street). At its two peaks are the 19th century Chapel of St. George, a theatre, and a restaurant.

==Mythical and legendary stories==
Lycabettus appears in various legends. Popular stories suggest it was once the refuge of wolves (lycos in Greek), which is possibly the origin of its name (means &quot;the one [the hill] that is walked by wolves&quot;). Another etymology suggests a Pelasgian, pre-Mycenean, origin (&quot;Lucabetu=mastoid hill&quot;).

Mythologically, Lycabettus is credited to Athena, who created it when she dropped a limestone mountain she had been carrying from the Pallene peninsula for the construction of the Acropolis after the box holding Erichthonius was opened.

==Theatre==

The hill has a large open-air amphitheatre near the top, which has housed many Greek and international concerts. Since 2008 it is closed due to safety concerns. By 2022 the city of Athens suggested the renovation and reopening of the theatre. Among the artists who have performed at the Lycabettus theatre are Ray Charles, Joan Baez, B.B. King, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Leonard Cohen, James Brown, Bob Dylan, Paco De Lucia, Al Di Meola, John Mc Laughlin, Gary Moore, Peter Gabriel, Black Sabbath, Nick Cave, Bjork, Dead Can Dance, Pet Shop Boys, Deep Purple, UB40, Placebo, Morrissey, Radiohead, Moby, Massive Attack, Faith No More, Faithless, Whitesnake, Tracy Chapman, Nightwish, Slipknot, Patti Smith, Vanessa Mae, Bryan Ferry, Tito Puente, Buena Vista Social Club, Orishas, The Prodigy, Iron Maiden, Nazareth, Blackmore&#x27;s Night, Scorpions, Mathame, Adriatique, Rotting Christ, Echonomist, Nick Jojo and Human Rias.

<text>Aubrey Vincent Beardsley ( ; 21 August 187216 March 1898) was an English illustrator and author. His black ink drawings were influenced by Japanese woodcuts, and depicted the grotesque, the decadent, and the erotic. He was a leading figure in the aesthetic movement which also included Oscar Wilde and James McNeill Whistler. Beardsley&#x27;s contribution to the development of the Art Nouveau and poster styles was significant despite his early death from tuberculosis. He is one of the important Modern Style figures.

== Early life, education, and early career ==
Beardsley was born in Brighton, Sussex, England, on 21 August 1872 and christened on 24 October 1872. His father, Vincent Paul Beardsley (1839–1909), was the son of a Clerkenwell jeweller; Vincent had no trade himself (partly owing to tuberculosis, from which his own father had died aged only 40), and relied on a private income from an inheritance that he received from his maternal grandfather, a property developer, when he was 21. Vincent&#x27;s wife, Ellen Agnus Pitt (1846–1932), was the daughter of Surgeon-Major William Pitt of the Indian Army. The Pitts were a well-established and respected family in Brighton, and Beardsley&#x27;s mother married a man of lesser social status than might have been expected. Soon after their wedding, Vincent was obliged to sell some of his property in order to settle a claim for his breach of promise of marriage from another woman, the widow of a clergyman, who claimed that he had promised to marry her. At the time of his birth, Beardsley&#x27;s family, which included his sister Mabel who was one year older, were living in Ellen&#x27;s familial home at 12 Buckingham Road. At the age of seven, Beardsley contracted tuberculosis.

With the loss of Vincent Beardsley&#x27;s fortune soon after his son&#x27;s birth, the family settled in London in 1883, where Vincent would work first for the West India &amp; Panama Telegraph Company, then irregularly as a clerk at breweries; they would spend the next 20 years in rented accommodation, battling poverty. Ellen took to presenting herself as the &quot;victim of a &quot;mésalliance&quot;&quot;. In 1884, Aubrey appeared in public as an &quot;infant musical phenomenon&quot;, playing at several concerts with his sister. In January 1885, he began to attend Brighton, Hove and Sussex Grammar School, where he spent the next four years. His first poems, drawings, and cartoons appeared in print in &quot;Past and Present&quot;, the school&#x27;s magazine. In 1888, he obtained a post in an architect&#x27;s office and afterwards one in the Guardian Life and Fire Insurance Company. In 1891, under the advice of Sir Edward Burne-Jones and Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, he took up art as a profession. In 1892, he attended the classes at the Westminster School of Art, then under Professor Fred Brown.

== Work ==

Beardsley travelled to Paris in 1892, where he discovered the poster art of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and the Parisian fashion for Japanese prints. His first commission was &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; by Thomas Malory (1893), illustrated for the publishing house J.M. Dent and Company. In 1894, a new translation of Lucian’s &quot;True History&quot;, with illustrations by Beardsley, William Strang, and J. B. Clark, was privately printed in an edition of 251 copies.

Beardsley had six years of creative output, which can be divided into several periods, identified by the form of his signature. In the early period, his work is mostly unsigned. During 1891 and 1892, he progressed to using his initials A.V.B. In mid-1892, the period of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; and &quot;The Bon Mots&quot;, he used a Japanese-influenced mark that became progressively more graceful, sometimes accompanied by A.B. in block capitals.
He co-founded &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; with American writer Henry Harland, and for the first four editions, he served as art editor and produced the cover designs and many illustrations for the magazine. He was aligned with Aestheticism, the British counterpart of Decadence and Symbolism. Most of his images are done in ink and feature large dark areas contrasted with large blank ones as well as areas of fine detail contrasted with areas with none at all.

Beardsley was the most controversial artist of the Art Nouveau era, renowned for his dark and perverse images and grotesque erotica, which were the main themes of his later work. He satirized Victorian values regarding sex, which at the time highly valued respectability, and men&#x27;s fear of female superiority, as the women&#x27;s movement made gains in economic rights and occupational and educational opportunities by the 1880s.

His illustrations were in black and white against a white background. Some of his drawings, inspired by Japanese shunga artwork, featured enormous genitalia. His most famous erotic illustrations concerned themes of history and mythology; these include his illustrations for a privately printed edition of Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;Lysistrata&quot; and his drawings for Oscar Wilde&#x27;s play &quot;Salome&quot;, which eventually premiered in Paris in 1896. Other major illustration projects included an 1896 edition of &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot; by Alexander Pope.
He also produced extensive illustrations for books and magazines (e.g., for a deluxe edition of Sir Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;) and worked for magazines such as &quot;The Studio&quot; and &quot;The Savoy&quot;, of which he was a co-founder. As a co-founder of &quot;The Savoy&quot;, Beardsley was able to pursue his writing as well as illustration, and a number of his writings, including &quot;Under the Hill&quot; (a story based on the Tannhäuser legend) and &quot;The Ballad of a Barber&quot; appeared in the magazine.

Beardsley was a caricaturist and did some political cartoons, mirroring Wilde&#x27;s irreverent wit in art. Beardsley&#x27;s work reflected the decadence of his era and his influence was enormous, clearly visible in the work of the French Symbolists, the Poster Art Movement of the 1890s and the work of many later-period Art Nouveau artists such as Papé and Clarke. Some alleged works of Beardsley&#x27;s were published in a book titled &quot;Fifty Drawings by Aubrey Beardsley, Selected from the Collection of Mr. H.S. Nicols&quot;. These later were discovered to be forgeries, distinguishable by their almost pornographic erotic elements rather than Beardsley&#x27;s subtler use of sexuality.

Beardsley&#x27;s work continued to cause controversy in Britain long after his death. During an exhibition of Beardsley&#x27;s prints held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in 1966, a private gallery in London was raided by the police for exhibiting copies of the same prints on display at the museum, and the owner charged under obscenity laws.

== Personal life ==

Beardsley was a public as well as private eccentric. He said &quot;I have one aim—the grotesque. If I am not grotesque, I am nothing.&quot; Wilde said Beardsley had &quot;a face like a silver hatchet, and grass green hair&quot;. Beardsley was meticulous about his attire: dove-grey suits, hats, ties, and yellow gloves. He appeared at his publisher&#x27;s in a morning coat and court shoes.

Although Beardsley was associated with the homosexual clique that included Oscar Wilde and other aesthetes, the details of his sexuality remain in question. In his &quot;Autobiographies,&quot; W.B. Yeats, who knew him well, says that he was not homosexual. Speculation about his sexuality includes rumours of an incestuous relationship with his elder sister, Mabel, who may have become pregnant by her brother and miscarried.

During his entire career, Beardsley had recurrent attacks of tuberculosis. He suffered frequent lung haemorrhages and often was unable to work or leave his home.

Beardsley converted to Catholicism in March 1897. The next year, the last letter before his death was to his publisher Leonard Smithers and close friend Herbert Charles Pollitt: Postmark: March 7, 1898 | Jesus is our Lord and Judge | Dear Friend, I implore you to destroy &quot;all&quot; copies of &quot;Lysistrata&quot; and bad drawings … By all that is holy, &quot;all&quot; obscene drawings. | Aubrey Beardsley | In my death agony.Both men ignored Beardsley&#x27;s wishes, and Smithers actually continued to sell reproductions as well as forgeries of Beardsley&#x27;s work.

== Death ==
In December 1896, Beardsley suffered a violent haemorrhage, leaving him in precarious health. By April 1897, a month after his conversion to Catholicism, his deteriorating health prompted a move to the French Riviera. There he died a year later, on 16 March 1898, of tuberculosis at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Menton, Alpes-Maritimes, France, attended by his mother and sister. He was 25 years old. Following a requiem Mass in Menton Cathedral the following day, his remains were interred in the Cimetière du Trabuquet.

== Media portrayals ==
In the 1982 &quot;Playhouse&quot; drama &quot;Aubrey&quot;, written by John Selwyn Gilbert, Beardsley was portrayed by actor John Dicks. The drama concerned Beardsley&#x27;s life from the time of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s arrest in April 1895, which caused Beardsley to lose his position at &quot;The Yellow Book&quot;, to his death from tuberculosis in 1898. The BBC documentary &quot;Beardsley and His Work&quot; was made in 1982. Beardsley is featured on the cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. The 1977 horror film &quot;Death Bed: The Bed That Eats&quot; is narrated by the entombed spirit of an unnamed artist whose work and manner of death identify him as Beardsley.

In March 2020, BBC Four broadcast the hour-long documentary &quot;Scandal &amp; Beauty: Mark Gatiss on Aubrey Beardsley&quot;, presented by Mark Gatiss. The programme coincided with the Beardsley exhibition at Tate Britain.

Beardsley&#x27;s art is mentioned briefly in the 2011 version of the Car Seat Headrest song, &quot;Beach Life-in-Death.&quot;

== Legacy ==
In 2019 the National Leather Association International established an award named after Beardsley for creators of abstract erotic art.

<text>Aconcagua () is a mountain in the Principal Cordillera of the Andes mountain range, in Mendoza Province, Argentina. It is the highest mountain in the Americas, the highest outside Asia, and the highest in both the Western Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere with a summit elevation of . Despite its size and stature, it is only the 189th highest mountain in the world. It lies northwest of the provincial capital, the city of Mendoza, about from San Juan Province, and from Argentina&#x27;s border with Chile. The mountain is one of the Seven Summits, the highest peaks on each of the seven continents.

Aconcagua is bounded by the &quot;Valle de las Vacas&quot; to the north and east and the &quot;Valle de los Horcones Inferior&quot; to the west and south. The mountain and its surroundings are part of Aconcagua Provincial Park. The mountain has a number of glaciers. The largest glacier is the Ventisquero Horcones Inferior at about long, which descends from the south face to about in elevation near the Confluencia camp.
Two other large glacier systems are the Ventisquero de las Vacas Sur and Glaciar Este/Ventisquero Relinchos system at about long. The best known is the northeastern or Polish Glacier, as it is a common route of ascent.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the name is uncertain. It may be from the Mapudungun &quot;Aconca-Hue&quot;, which refers to the Aconcagua River and means &quot;comes from the other side&quot;; the Quechua &quot;Ackon Cahuak&quot;, meaning &quot;Sentinel of Stone&quot;; the Quechua &quot;Anco Cahuac&quot;, meaning &quot;White Sentinel&quot;; or the Aymara &quot;Janq&#x27;u Q&#x27;awa&quot;, meaning &quot;White Ravine&quot;.

== Geologic history ==

The mountain was created by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate. Aconcagua used to be an active stratovolcano (from the Late Cretaceous or Early Paleocene through the Miocene) and consisted of several volcanic complexes on the edge of a basin with a shallow sea. However, sometime in the Miocene, about 8 to 10 million years ago, the subduction angle started to decrease, resulting in a stop of the melting and more horizontal stresses between the oceanic plate and the continent, causing the thrust faults that lifted Aconcagua off its volcanic root. The rocks on Aconcagua&#x27;s flanks are all volcanic and consist of lavas, breccias and pyroclastics. The shallow marine basin had already formed earlier (Triassic), even before Aconcagua arose as a volcano. However, volcanism has been present in this region for as long as this basin was around and volcanic deposits interfinger with marine deposits throughout the sequence. The colorful greenish, bluish and grey deposits seen in the Horcones Valley and south of Puente Del Inca, are carbonates, limestones, turbidites and evaporates that filled this basin. The red-colored rocks are intrusions, cinder deposits and conglomerates of volcanic origin.

==Climbing==
In mountaineering terms, Aconcagua is technically an easy mountain if approached from the north, via the normal route. Aconcagua is arguably the highest &quot;non-technical&quot; mountain in the world since the northern route does not absolutely require ropes, axes, and pins. Although the effects of altitude are severe (atmospheric pressure is 40% of sea level at the summit), the use of supplemental oxygen is not common. Altitude sickness will affect most climbers to some extent, depending on the degree of acclimatization. Although the normal climb is technically easy, multiple casualties occur every year on this mountain (in January 2009 alone, five climbers died). This is due to the large numbers of climbers who attempt and because many climbers underestimate the objective risks of the elevation and of cold weather, which is the real challenge on this mountain. Given the weather conditions close to the summit, cold weather injuries are very common.
The routes to the peak from the south and south-west ridges are more demanding and the south face climb is considered quite difficult.
The Polish Glacier Traverse route, also known as the &quot;Falso de los Polacos&quot; route, crosses through the Vacas valley, ascends to the base of the Polish Glacier, then traverses across to the normal route for the final ascent to the summit. The third most popular route is by the Polish Glacier itself.

Provincial Park rangers do not maintain records of successful summits but estimates suggest a summit rate of 30–40%. About 75% of climbers are foreigners and 25% are Argentinean. Among foreigners, the United States leads in the number of climbers, followed by Germany and the UK. About 54% of climbers ascend the Normal Route, 43% up the Polish Glacier Traverse Route, and the remaining 3% on other routes.

Climbing Aconcagua requires a mandatory climbing permit costing around US$ 210 (~20,000 in the local currency). The permit covers park entry and basic rescue services. It can be purchased at the park entrance or in Mendoza city.

===Camps===
The campsites on the normal route are listed below (elevations are approximate).
* Puente del Inca, : A small village on the main road, with facilities including a lodge.
* Confluencia, : A camp site a few hours into the national park.
* Plaza de Mulas, : Base camp, claimed to be the second largest in the world (after Everest). There are several meal tents, showers and internet access. There is a lodge approximately from the main campsite across the glacier. At this camp, climbers are screened by a medical team to check if they are fit enough to continue the climb.
* Camp Canadá, : A large ledge overlooking Plaza de Mulas.
* Camp Alaska, : Called &#x27;change of slope&#x27; in Spanish, a small site as the slope from Plaza de Mulas to Nido de Cóndores lessens. Not commonly used.
* Nido de Cóndores, : A large plateau with extensive views. There is usually a park ranger camped here.
* Camp Berlín, : The classic high camp, offering reasonable wind protection.
* Camp Colera, : A larger, while slightly more exposed, camp situated directly at the north ridge near Camp Berlín, with growing popularity. In January 2011, a shelter was opened in Camp Colera for exclusive use in cases of emergency. The shelter is named &quot;Elena&quot; after Italian climber Elena Senin, who died in January 2009 shortly after reaching the summit, and whose family donated the shelter.
* Several sites possible for camping or bivouac, including Piedras Blancas (~6100 m) and Independencia (~6350 m), are located above Colera; however, they are seldom used and offer little protection.

Summit attempts are usually made from a high camp at either Berlín or Colera, or from the lower camp at Nido de Cóndores.

===History===
The first attempt to summit Aconcagua by Europeans was made in 1883 by a party led by the German geologist and explorer Paul Güssfeldt. Bribing porters with the story of treasure on the mountain, he approached the mountain via the Rio Volcan, making two attempts on the peak by the northwest ridge and reaching an elevation of . The route that he prospected is now the standard route up the mountain.

The first recorded ascent was in 1897 by a European expedition led by the British mountaineer Edward FitzGerald. FitzGerald failed to reach the summit himself over eight attempts between December 1896 and February 1897, but the (Swiss) guide of the expedition, Matthias Zurbriggen reached the summit on 14 January. On the final attempt a month later, two other expedition members, Stuart Vines and Nicola Lanti, reached the summit on 13 February.

The east side of Aconcagua was first scaled by a Polish expedition, with Konstanty Narkiewicz-Jodko, , and Stefan Osiecki summiting on 8 March 1934, over what is now known as the &quot;Polish Glacier&quot;. A route over the Southwest Ridge was pioneered over seven days in January 1953 by the Swiss-Argentine team of Frederico and Dorly Marmillod, Francisco Ibanez and Fernando Grajales. The famously difficult South Face was conquered by a French team led by . Pierre Lesueur, Adrien Dagory, Robert Paragot, Edmond Denis, Lucien Berardini and Guy Poulet reached the summit after a month of effort on 25 February 1954.

 the youngest person to reach the summit of Aconcagua is Tyler Armstrong of California. He was nine years old when he reached the summit on 24 December 2013. Kaamya Karthikeyan of India at an age of 12 became the youngest girl to reach the summit on 1 February 2020. The oldest person to climb it was Scott Lewis, who reached the summit on 26 November 2007, when he was 87 years old.

In the base camp Plaza de Mulas (at above sea level) there is the highest contemporary art gallery tent called &quot;Nautilus&quot; of the Argentine painter Miguel Doura.

In 2014, Kilian Jornet set a record for climbing and descending Aconcagua from Horcones in 12 hours and 49 minutes. The record was broken less than two months later by Ecuadorian-Swiss Karl Egloff, in a time of 11 hours 52 minutes, nearly an hour faster than Kilian Jornet. In 2016, set the first women&#x27;s record for climbing and descending Aconcagua from Horcones in 22 hours, 52 minutes. The current women&#x27;s record is held by Ecuadorean Daniela Sandoval at 20 hours, 17 minutes. 

On January 23, 2019 the Cholita climbers were the first Indigenous, Aymara women to climb the mountain in traditional clothing. Their climb was sponsored by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Bolivia and the expedition is now detailed in a documentary film called &#x27;Cholitas&#x27;. 

On 25 September 2019, an Airbus Helicopters H145 landed on the very peak of Mount Aconcagua. This is the first time in history a twin-engine helicopter has landed at this altitude. It took a total of 45 minutes for the entire trip, 30 minutes from Mendoza and another 15 from the base camp up to the peak. Temperatures were reported as low as , with wind gusts up to . This is not the highest a helicopter has landed before, as a single-engine Airbus Helicopters H125 landed on Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world.

===Dangers===
At nearly , Aconcagua is the highest peak outside of Asia. It is believed to have the highest death rate of any mountain in South around three a which has earned it the nickname &quot;Mountain of Death&quot;. More than 100 people have died on Aconcagua since records began.

Due to the improper disposal of human waste in the mountain environment there are significant health hazards that pose a threat to both animals and human beings. Only boiled or chemically treated water is acceptable for drinking. Additionally, ecofriendly toilets are available only to members of an organised expedition, meaning climbers have to &quot;be contracted to a toilet service&quot; at the base camp and similar camps along the route. As of 2015, from two base camps (Plaza de Mulas and Plaza Argentina), over 120 barrels of waste (approx. ) are flown out by helicopter each season. In addition, individual mountaineers must make a payment before using these toilets. Some large organisers will charge up to , while smaller ones may charge per day or for the entire stay; thus, many independent mountaineers choose to defecate on the mountainside.

== Mythological meaning ==
For the Incas, Aconcagua was a sacred mountain. As on other mountains (e.g. Ampato), places of worship were built here and sacrifices, including human sacrifices, were made. The sites discovered in 1985 at an elevation of 5167 m are among the highest in the world and are the most difficult of all Inca sites to reach. Here, the remains of a child bedded on grass, cloth and feathers were found inside stone walls (Aconcagua mummy). The clothing indicates that the child was a member of the highest social class. Other offerings found included figures and coca leaves.

<doc id="220172" wikidata="Q468270" url="?curid=220172" title="Girly girl">
<text>Girly girl is a term for a girl or woman who presents herself in a traditionally feminine way. This may include wearing pink, using make-up, using perfume, having long hair, having long nails, dressing in dresses, skirts, pantyhoses and heels, and engaging in activities that are traditionally associated with femininity, such as talking about relationships.

The term is often used in a derogatory manner, but it can also be used in a more positive way, especially when considering the fluidity of gender roles. Being a &quot;girly girl&quot; can then be seen as a fluid and partially embodied position – a form of discourse taken up, discarded or modified for tactical or strategic purposes.

==Social determinants==

The female opposite of a girly girl is a tomboy. The increasing prevalence of girly girls in the early 21st century has been linked to a supposed &quot;post-feminist, post–new man construction of masculinity and femininity in mutually exclusive terms&quot;, as opposed to the more blurred gender representations of previous decades.

<doc id="220178" wikidata="Q6694479" url="?curid=220178" title="Loyalty Day">
<text>Loyalty Day is observed on May 1 in the United States. It was proclaimed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower as a day for declaring loyalty to the United States of America and to acknowledge American history.

The date, May 1, was set in order to counter International Workers&#x27; Day and was recognized by the U.S. Congress during the height of the Second Red Scare. 

Each year on Loyalty Day, the current president is requested to issue a proclamation that asks the American government officials to display the American flag on all government buildings. The proclamations also ask for the American people to observe Loyalty Day with ceremonies in suitable places. The most common way of celebrating is with parades. 

== History ==

International Workers&#x27; Day, held annually on May 1, has commemorated the labor struggle since the late 19th century. The date commemorates the 1886 Haymarket affair in Chicago. Social upheaval following World War I, and especially the October Revolution in Russia, developed into the First Red Scare, which led to government crackdowns on organized labor, the communist movement, and other activities seen as &quot;radical&quot;. It was in this environment that Loyalty Day (originally called &quot;Americanization Day&quot;) was created in 1921 as an explicit replacement for International Workers&#x27; Day.

An early celebration held for Americanization Day was on May 1, 1930, when 10,000 VFW members staged a rally at New York&#x27;s Union Square to promote patriotism. 

During the Second Red Scare, it was recognized by the U.S. Congress on April 27, 1955, and made an official reoccurring holiday on July 18, 1958 (Public Law 85-529). President Dwight D. Eisenhower proclaimed May 1, 1955, the first observance of Loyalty Day. In 1958, Eisenhower urged Congress to move Child Health Day to the First Monday in October, to avoid conflicting with Loyalty Day. Loyalty Day has been recognized with an official proclamation every year by every president since its inception as a legal holiday in 1958.

<doc id="220186" wikidata="Q155679" url="?curid=220186" title="Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23">
<text>The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 (; NATO reporting name: Flogger) is a variable-geometry fighter aircraft, designed by the Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau in the Soviet Union. It is a third-generation jet fighter, alongside similar Soviet aircraft such as the Su-17 &quot;Fitter&quot;. It was the first Soviet fighter to field a look-down/shoot-down radar, the RP-23 Sapfir, and one of the first to be armed with beyond-visual-range missiles. Production started in 1969 and reached large numbers with over 5,000 aircraft built, making it the most produced variable-sweep wing aircraft in history. The MiG-23 remains in limited service with some export customers.

The basic design was also used as the basis for the Mikoyan MiG-27, a dedicated ground-attack variant. Among many minor changes, the MiG-27 replaced the MiG-23&#x27;s nose-mounted radar system with an optical panel holding a laser designator and a TV camera.

==Development==

The MiG-23&#x27;s predecessor, the MiG-21, was fast and agile, but limited in its operational capabilities by its primitive radar, short range, and limited weapons load (restricted in some aircraft to a pair of short-range R-3/K-13 (AA-2 &quot;Atoll&quot;) air-to-air missiles). Work began on a replacement for the MiG-21 in the early 1960s. The new aircraft was required to have better performance and range than the MiG-21, while carrying more capable avionics and weapons including beyond-visual-range (BVR) missiles. A major design consideration was take-off and landing performance. The Soviet Air Force (VVS) demanded the new aircraft have a much shorter take-off run. Low-level speed and handling was also to be improved over the MiG-21. Manoeuvrability was not an urgent requirement. This led Mikoyan to consider two options: lift jets, to provide an additional lift component; and variable-geometry wings, which had been developed by TsAGI for both &quot;clean-sheet&quot; aircraft designs and adaptations of existing designs.

The first option, for an aircraft fitted with lift jets, resulted in the &quot;23-01&quot;, also known as the MiG-23PD (&#x27; – lift jet), was a tailed delta of similar layout to the smaller MiG-21 but with two lift jets in the fuselage. This first flew on 3 April 1967, but it soon became apparent that this configuration was unsatisfactory, as the lift jets became useless dead weight once airborne. Work on the second strand of development was carried out in parallel by a team led by A.A Andreyev, with MiG directed to build a variable-geometry prototype, the &quot;23-11&quot; in 1965.

The 23-11 featured variable-geometry wings which could be set to angles of 16, 45 and 72 degrees, and it was clearly more promising. The maiden flight of 23–11 took place on 10 June 1967, flown by the famous MiG test pilot Aleksandr Vasilyevich Fedotov. Six more flight prototypes and two static-test prototypes were prepared for further flight and system testing. All featured the Tumansky R-27-300 turbojet engine with a thrust of 77 kN (17,300 lbf). The order to start series production of the MiG-23 was given in December 1967. The first production &quot;MiG-23S&quot; (NATO reporting name &#x27;Flogger-A&#x27;) took to the air on 21 May 1969, with Fedotov at the controls.

The General Dynamics F-111 and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II were the main Western influences on the MiG-23. The Soviets, however, wanted a much lighter, single-engined fighter to maximize agility. Both the F-111 and the MiG-23 were designed as fighters, but the heavy weight and inherent stability of the F-111 turned it into a long-range interdictor and kept it out of the fighter role. The MiG-23&#x27;s designers kept the MiG-23 light and agile enough to dogfight with enemy fighters.

==Design==

===Armament===
The armament carried by the MiG-23 changed as new models underwent development. The initial production variant, the MiG-23S, was fitted with the S-21 fire control system borrowed from the MiG-21S/SM. Based on the RP-22SM Sapfir-21 radar with an ASP-PFD-21 lead computing gunsight, it could carry only four R-3/K-13 (AA-2 &quot;Atoll&quot;) air-to-air missiles (typically two SARH R-3Rs and two IR R-3Ss) in addition to a Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-23L autocannon. In the ground-attack role, the MiG-23S could carry two Kh-23 (AS-7 &quot;Kerry&quot;) radio guidance air-to-surface missiles, two to four UB-16 rocket pods with S-5 rockets, S-24 rockets or up to of various bomb types. The MiG-23 Edition 1971, equipped with the Sapfir-23L radar and TP-23 infrared search and track (IRST), could fire the new BVR R-23 (AA-7 &quot;Apex&quot;) missile, although only the R-23R SARH variant. However, the Sapfir-23L was considered unreliable and lacked look-down/shoot-down capability.

The MiG-23M, the definitive first-generation variant of the fighter, was equipped with the improved Sapfir-23D look-down/shoot-down radar and could carry a pair of R-23 missiles (either the R-23R SARH or R-23T IR variants) and a pair of R-60 (AA-8 &quot;Aphid&quot;) missiles. Starting with aircraft number 3201, the APU-60-2 double-rail launcher was introduced, allowing the MiG-23M to carry four R-60 missiles. The MiG-23 could carry up to in bombs and rockets, and from aircraft number 3701 onward it could fire the Kh-23 and Kh-23M air-to-surface missiles. Lastly, all VVS MiG-23Ms had the ability to mount a single nuclear bomb via a special adapter under the fuselage, either the 10-kiloton RN-24 or the 30-kiloton RN-40.

In the second-generation MiG-23ML, a new SUV-2ML weapons system allowed the aircraft to carry both types of R-23 missiles simultaneously. The typical loadout was an R-23R on the starboard wing pylon and an R-23T on the port wing pylon. Besides other ordnance (including a single nuclear bomb), the MiG-23ML could also carry two UPK-23-250 23 mm gun pods on the underwing pylons. Starting in 1981, the MiG-23MLA could carry the improved Vympel R-24R/T missiles. The final fighter variant, the MiG-23MLD, could also carry the improved R-24R/T missiles in addition to a pair of B8M1 20-round rocket pods firing S-8 rockets, the Kh-23/Kh-23M air-to-surface missile, or a single RN-24 or RN-40 nuclear bomb. The MiG-23MLD&#x27;s maximum bomb load was , with a standard loadout comprising four FAB-500 general-purpose bombs (GP) or ZAB-500 napalm bombs. Other configurations included sixteen FAB-100 GP bombs carried on four ejector racks, four FAB-250 GP bombs, or two RBK-500 cluster bombs.

===Cockpit===

The MiG-23 cockpit was considered an improvement over previous Soviet fighters as it was more ergonomic in its layout. However the pilot still had a high workload, having to manipulate switches and monitor gauges, compared to more modern aircraft with HOTAS controls. The instrument panel featured a white stripe to serve as a visual aid for centering the control column during an out-of-control situation. To prevent the pilot from exceeding a 17° angle of attack, the control column incorporated a &quot;knuckle rapper&quot; which would strike the pilot&#x27;s knuckles as the limit was approached.

Cockpit visibility was also somewhat poor in the MiG-23, although the view straight ahead was superior compared to the MiG-21. In particular, visibility was poor looking to the rear, partially due to the ejection seat which wrapped around the pilot&#x27;s head, requiring the pilot to lean forward to look to the side or behind. To assist with looking directly behind the pilot, the cockpit was fitted with a mirror or &#x27;periscope&#x27; embedded in the middle rail of the canopy, similar to the one on the MiG-17. With an infinity focus, the periscope provided a clear view of behind the plane, but did not have a wide field of view.

The MiG-23&#x27;s ejection seat, the KM-1, was built with extreme altitude and speed in mind: leg stirrups, shoulder harness, pelvic D-ring, and a 3-parachute system. Engaging the ejection seat could take a long time, as the pilots had to place their feet in the stirrups, let go of the control column, grab the two trigger handles, squeeze and lift them. The first parachute, the size of a large handkerchief, was deployed out of a telescoping rod which would pop out of the top back of the seat as it started to clear the windscreen windbreak area. It was supposed to help rotate the seat into the windblast and stabilize into a flight path that would take it above and behind the vertical stabilizer. As the first chute and rod separated from the seat, a larger drogue parachute deployed to slow down the seat, allowing the deployment of the main parachute. If engaged at low altitudes, the seat included a barometric element that allowed the drogue chute to separate more quickly. One deficiency of the KM-1 was that it was not a zero-zero ejection seat – it required a minimum speed of 90 knots.

Starting with the MiG-23 Edition 1971, the MiG-23 replaced the head-down radar scope with an ASP-23D gunsight/head-up display (HUD) onto which data from the radar was displayed. This was updated in the MiG-23MLA with the ASP-17ML gunsight/HUD. Because information from the radar had to fit on the combining glass of the HUD, the amount of space that could be scanned was limited to a relatively thin slice. This required that the fighter be flown very close to the target&#x27;s altitude and well ahead of it to be picked up, necessitating good ground-controlled interception (GCI) instructions. Israeli pilots who flew captured versions of the MiG-23 found it relatively easy to use.

===Control surfaces===
The MiG-23 was among the first Soviet aircraft to feature variable-geometry wings. These were hydraulically controlled by means of a small lever set beneath the throttle in the cockpit. There were three main sweep angles that were set by the pilot for different levels of flying. The first, with the wings fully spread at 16°, was used when cruising at or below Mach 0.7 or when taking off and landing. Putting the wings at mid-spread of 45° was used for basic fighter maneuvering, as well as cruising at high speeds or making low-altitude intercepts. Moving the wings to fully swept at 72° was reserved for making high-altitude intercepts or high-speed dashes at low altitudes.
The wings were not fitted with ailerons but used spoilers to control rolling when the wings were at 16° and 45° angles. In addition to the spoilers, the wings were fitted with trailing edge flaps and leading edge slats to try to give the fighter a short take-off and landing performance. Although there was a gauge in the cockpit showing the position of the wings, when they were in motion, and the Mach limit for each position, there was none to indicate what was the optimum wing position for the prevailing flight condition.

Two tailerons controlled pitch and roll, in the latter case working in conjunction with wing control surfaces when the wings were not fully swept back. In addition to a large vertical stabilizer (which also stored the brake parachute for landings), the MiG-23 had a ventral fin to improve directional stability at high speeds. During take-off and landing, the fin hinged sideways when the landing gear was extended to prevent it striking the ground.

Starting with the Edition 1971 model, the MiG-23&#x27;s wings (known as Edition 2) had their surface area increased by 20%, necessitating the positions be changed to 18°, 47° 40&#x27;, and 74° 40&#x27; (though for convenience the cockpit indicators and manuals retained the original labeling). A dogtooth extension was added but the leading-edge slats were removed to simplify manufacturing. However this proved to exacerbate the MiG-23&#x27;s stability issues at high AoA and made take-off and landings more difficult. The definitive Edition 3 wing design, introduced with the MiG-23M, retained the dimensions of the Edition 2 but added back in the leading-edge slats.

A strengthening of the wing pivot in the MiG-23MLD allowed the addition of a fourth wing sweep position of 33°, which was intended to reduce turn radius and allow for rapid deceleration during dogfights. However, with the wings at the 33° position, the MiG-23MLD was much more difficult to handle and suffered from poor acceleration. Moving the wings to this position was primarily reserved for experienced MiG-23 pilots, while combat manuals continued to emphasize the 45° position.

===Engine===
The MiG-23&#x27;s original engine was a thrust Tumansky R-29-300 with thrust to spare at the aircraft top speed of Mach 2.4. It also had a fast acceleration time, taking 3–4 seconds to go from idle to full power, and took less than a second to ignite the afterburner. The aircraft&#x27;s placarded top speed was set by cockpit canopy structural strength. The engine intake had louvers which supplied the environmental control system with air to keep the avionics and pilot cool.

Similar to early examples of the F-4 Phantom&#x27;s J-79 engine, the R-29 would generate smoke when operating without the afterburner. The engine outer cases ran very hot, which sometimes triggered false fire alarms. Moreover, the engine was good for only a couple of hundred sorties at most before requiring replacement. This was partly because Russian engines were designed to last about 150 hours before being replaced. It was also a way to generate income from export customers by selling them new engines in exchange for hard currency. Changing an engine was difficult because the aircraft had to be separated in the middle.

The engine was also a weak point on early models of the MiG-23 as it was not stressed for high yaw manoeuvre loads. If the fighter entered a spin, the engine shaft could bend. Compressor blades would rub sending debris into the turbine causing turbine blades to break off, destroying the engine. Introduction of the R-29B-300 addressed this design deficiency.

===Fuel===
The prototype version of the MiG-23 carried three fuel tanks in the fuselage, with capacities of respectively. Additionally, each wing carried three integral fuel tanks of . The No. 2 fuel tank in the fuselage also functioned as the aircraft&#x27;s carry-through wingbox and was welded together with thick plates of VNS-2 steel alloy. The MiG-23 &quot;Edition 1971&quot; redesign allowed for a fourth tank carrying to be fitted in the rear of the fuselage. This fuel capacity gave the MiG-23 better endurance than a &quot;clean&quot; F-4 (carrying no drop tanks); if traveling at the MiG-23&#x27;s endurance speed of 230 knots an individual sortie could be stretched out to an hour, though if the afterburner was used that could fall down to around 45 minutes or less. Introduced with the MiG-23M were plumbed pylons under the movable wing panels which could be fitted with drop tanks, though these could only be carried with the wings at full spread and had to be jettisoned otherwise, and a third 800-liter drop tank could be carried under the fuselage on the MiG-23ML.

Early models of the MiG-23 ran into problems with the plane&#x27;s No. 2 fuel tank suffering structural failures, which were especially problematic as the tanks were integral to the structure rather than contained within a fuel bladder. This meant that as the structure developed hairline fractures fuel would seep out. This eventually forced severe g-force limits until a solution could be found. Prior to quality being improved in later models, one fix was to weld a plate on the inside surface and a stiffener on the outer skin.

=== Performance tests ===
Most potential enemies of the USSR and its client states have had opportunities to evaluate the MiG-23&#x27;s performance. In the summer of 1977, after a political realignment by its government, Egypt provided a number of MiG-23MSs and MiG-23BNs to the United States; these were evaluated under a pair of exploitation programs codenamed HAVE PAD and HAVE BOXER respectively. These and other MiGs, including additional MiG-23s acquired from other sources, were used as part of a secret training program known as project Constant Peg to familiarize American pilots with Soviet aircraft. Additionally, a Cuban pilot flew a MiG-23BN to the U.S. in 1991, and a Libyan MiG-23 pilot also defected to Greece in 1981. In both cases, the aircraft were later repatriated.

Initially, American intelligence on the MiG-23 assumed that the fighter could turn well and had reasonable acceleration capability, but testing during HAVE PAD proved this assumption to be incorrect. While its turning capability was comparable to an original F-4E Phantom, newer American fighters like the F-15 Eagle or F-4E upgraded with slats could easily out-turn the MiG-23 in a dogfight. In fact, whenever the MiG-23 approached high angle of attack it became very unstable and liable to depart controlled flight. Conversely, the MiG-23&#x27;s acceleration capability was tremendous, particularly at low altitudes (below ) and crossing the sound barrier, where it could out-accelerate any American fighter. The fighter&#x27;s small profile gave it the advantage of being hard to spot visually as well. Overall, HAVE PAD testing determined that the MiG-23 - while a poor dogfighter - made for a good interceptor capable of performing hit-and-run attacks. Despite its limitations, in the hands of a very capable pilot the MiG-23 represented a serious threat in air combat.

Test pilots who flew the MiG-23 as part of Constant Peg came to similar conclusions about the MiG-23 being an effective interceptor rather than a dogfighter, but were more critical of the planes they flew. Among their complaints was that the MiG-23&#x27;s airframe was too easily overstressed; that it was unstable in yaw as it passed the sound barrier and again when approaching Mach 2; that its narrow landing gear, although designed to be used on unprepared surfaces, tended to slip and slide in adverse weather conditions; and because it sat low to the ground, it could more easily suck debris into its engine intakes. In general the MiG-23 was unpopular with the American pilots because it was so dangerous to fly.

Among the nicknames the Constant Peg pilots had for the MiG-23 was the &quot;Looping Hog&quot; because it flew like a pig and one of the few basic fighter maneuvers (BFM) it could pull off in a dogfight was a massive loop. If going fast enough, a MiG-23 could easily perform a loop high that other planes would struggle to follow, at the bottom of which it would cut back inside them and proceed to fly off until outside their visual range so it could come back in again. The only other BFM the MiG-23 could perform, according to Col (ret.) John &quot;Sax&quot; Saxman, was the &quot;no circle fight&quot;: as the two aircraft approached and passed close by each other the MiG-23, instead of trying to turn one way or the other with the enemy aircraft (as in a one-circle or two-circle fight), would speed on ahead until it could come back into the fight from a different angle.

The MiG-23&#x27;s deficits and qualities were also recognized by allied air forces which received the fighter from the Soviet Union, including the East German Air Force:
The pilots of Constant Peg sought to teach these and other aspects of the MiG-23 to the frontline Tactical Air Command squadrons (nicknamed Blue Air) against whom they trained:

The MiG-23&#x27;s speed in particular was used as a teaching aid for a couple of situations during a potential war with the Soviet Union. The first was at low altitudes to demonstrate its ability to run down any NATO or American strike aircraft (barring the late-model F-111F Aardvark), which would be attempting to go low and fast to penetrate Soviet territory. The second was to simulate the MiG-25 Foxbat, a high, fast flyer which would be going after high-value targets such as aerial refueling or airborne early warning and control aircraft like the E-3 Sentry.

The early MiG-23M series was also used to test the American Northrop F-5s captured by the North Vietnamese and sent to the former USSR for evaluation. The Soviets acknowledged the F-5 was a very agile aircraft, and at some speeds and altitudes better than the MiG-23M, one of the main reasons the MiG-23MLD and MiG-29 developments were started. These tests allowed the Russians to make modifications to several of their fourth-generation aircraft. The MiG-23, however, was not designed to combat F-5s, a weakness reflected by early MiG-23 variants.

According to the MiG-23ML technical manual, the MiG-23ML has a instantaneous turn rate of 16.7 deg/s and a sustained of 14.1 deg/s at of altitude and at a speed of ; and at maximum 7g load factor. It will take to the MiG-23ML around 25 seconds to complete the horizontal turn.
 the maximum instantaneous turn rate near the ground for the MiG-23 model 71 and MiG-23M is 16.5 deg/s, and for the MiG-23ML 18.3 deg/s.
In general, with this sweep wing angle of 45 degrees are significantly inferior to the wing 16 degrees of wing swept. Maximum sustained turn rate near the ground: 13.35 g/s for MiG-23 model 71, 14.5 g/s for MiG-23M and 15.4 g/s for MiG-23ML.

The maximum climb rate for the MiG-23 variant 1971 and the MiG-23M, especially at low altitudes shows a big difference gap. The difference between the MiG-23M and MiG-23ML is much smaller, but also noticeable. The maximum calculated climb rate on the MiG-23 sub variant 1971 is , which is not a very large indicator for a fighter of this class. In the MiG-23M, due to a much more powerful engine, the rate of climb increased to , almost more. This figure is already consistent with the &quot;status&quot; of a powerful fighter aircraft. On the MiG-23ML, mainly due to weight reduction, the climb rate reached , which corresponds to the most powerful aircraft of the 2-3rd generation, as well as some 4th generation fighters. 
==Operational history==
Western and Russian aviation historians usually differ in respect to combat record for their military vehicles and doctrines part due to the bias in favor of their respective national industries and academies. They also usually accept claims going along with their respective political views since usually many conflicting and contradictory reports are written and accepted by their respective historians. Before recent years, with widespread use of hand-portable cameras, little pictorial evidence could be published about specific losses and victories of the different combat systems, with a limited number of losses and victories confirmed by both parties.

===Soviet and Warsaw Pact===
The MiG-23 was first officially commissioned into the Soviet Air Forces (VVS) on 4 January 1974, but even before its mass introduction there had been many teething problems with the brand-new fighter. Stability issues and limited maneuverability resulted in numerous flight restrictions placed on the fighter as efforts to rectify these concerns began in the mid-1970s. Despite numerous updates, these restrictions would only be partially lifted with the introduction of the MiG-23MLD. Still, the large number of MiG-23s deployed in Central Europe represented a sufficiently potent threat in a possible war with the West.

Although many MiG-23 pilots were disappointed to discover their fighter would lose in a turning engagement with the MiG-21, the MiG-23 gave the VVS capabilities which the MiG-21 simply lacked, particularly as a high-energy fighter with BVR missiles. However, throughout the 1970s and early 1980s Soviet pilots continued to train and operate the MiG-23 in the same inflexible manner as the MiG-21: a high-speed point defense interceptor closely guided by GCI. It was not until the widespread introduction of the MiG-23MLD that Soviet pilots began to use the MiG-23 as a true air-superiority fighter.

By the 1980s, the MiG-23&#x27;s accident rate in the VVS averaged 12.5 losses per 100,000 flying hours. This was often worse in the air forces of the Warsaw Pact allies: 24.3 major mishaps per 100,000 flying hours in the Hungarian Air Force; 20.4 losses per 100,000 flying hours in the East German Air Force; 18 losses per 100,000 flying hours in the Bulgarian Air Force; and 11.3 losses per 100,000 flying hours in the Polish Air Force.

By 1990, over 1,500 MiG-23s of different models were in service with the VVS and the V-PVO. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the new Russian Air Force began to cut back its fighter force, and it was decided that the single-engine MiG-23s and MiG-27s were to be retired to operational storage. The last model to serve was the MiG-23P air-defense variant: it was retired on 1 May 1998.

When East and West Germany unified, no MiG-23s were transferred to the German Air Force, but twelve former East German MiG-23s were supplied to the United States. When Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the Czechs received all the MiG-23s, which were retired in 1998. Hungary retired its MiG-23s in 1996, Poland in 1999, Romania in 2000, and Bulgaria in 2004.

The MiG-23 was the Soviet Air Force&#x27;s &quot;Top Gun&quot;-equivalent aggressor aircraft from the late 1970s to the late 1980s. It proved a difficult opponent for early MiG-29 variants flown by inexperienced pilots. Exercises showed when well-flown, a MiG-23MLD could achieve favorable kill ratios against the MiG-29 in mock combat by using hit-and-run tactics and not engaging the MiG-29s in dogfights. Usually the aggressor MiG-23MLDs had a shark mouth painted on the nose just aft of the radome, and many were piloted by Soviet–Afghan War veterans. In the late 1980s, these aggressor MiG-23s were replaced by MiG-29s, also featuring shark mouths.

Soviet–Afghan War

Soviet MiG-23s were used over Afghanistan, often being used to escort missions close to the borders of Pakistan and Iran, as the MiG-21 lacked the necessary range to do so. Some of them were claimed to have been shot down.

The earliest use of the MiG-23 in Afghanistan occurred in April 1982, when aircraft of the 152nd IAP escorted a large air raid against Rabat-e-Jali in Nimruz province. This developed into a disaster when the MiG-23s failed to provide adequate air cover and the strike force accidentally crossed into Iran, losing several helicopters to Iranian F-4 Phantoms.

Soviet and Afghan MiG-23s and Pakistani F-16s clashed a few times during the Soviet–Afghan War from 1987. Two MiG-23 were claimed shot down by Pakistani F-16s when crossing the border (they both were not confirmed) while one F-16 was shot down on 29 April 1987. Western sources consider it a friendly fire incident but the Soviet-backed Afghan government of the time and Pakistan claimed that Soviet aircraft downed the Pakistani F-16 – a claim that &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Washington Post&quot; also reported. According to a Russian version of the event, the F-16 was shot down when Pakistani F-16s encountered Soviet MiG-23MLDs. Soviet MiG-23MLD pilots, while on a bombing raid along the Pakistani-Afghan border, reported being attacked by F-16s and then seeing one F-16 explode. It could have been downed by gunfire from a MiG whose pilot did not report the kill, because Soviet pilots were not allowed to attack Pakistani aircraft without permission.

In 1988, Soviet MiG-23MLDs using R-23s (NATO: AA-7 &quot;Apex&quot;) downed two Iranian AH-1J Cobras that had intruded into Afghan airspace. In a similar incident a decade earlier, on 21 June 1978, a PVO MiG-23M flown by Pilot Captain V. Shkinder shot down two Iranian Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopters that had trespassed into Soviet airspace, one helicopter being dispatched by two R-60 missiles and the other by cannon fire.

Air-to-air encounters, however, were not particularly frequent, with close air support accounting for most missions flown in Afghanistan while combat air patrol and air-to-air escort missions comprised 15% of the total. Sorties with dumb bombs and cluster munitions were flown against a wide range of targets, while more sophisticated weaponry was not often employed because of the difficult terrain and threat of MANPADs and AA. Attacks were made in pairs, with both MiGs diving at a 45-degree angle before releasing their bombs. After heavy losses in 1984–5, tactics were re-evaluated and a minimum altitude of 3,500 m (11,480 ft) was introduced. This was later increased to 4,500 m (14,760 ft). The accuracy of attacks was lowered and it became impossible to use unguided rockets at all. However, this was effective at reducing losses; there were none during 1986.

The two-seater MiG-23UB also saw service in Afghanistan, used for strike, reconnaissance and target designation. It was also used to familiarise MiG-27 pilots with flying in the hot and high conditions of Afghanistan when they were deployed there in 1988. Additionally, MiG-23UBs sometimes acted as a makeshift &#x27;AWACS&#x27; aircraft, with an officer in the back seat observing and issuing commands to a strike group below him. The concept was dubbed &quot;I am my own AWACS&quot; by the Soviet pilots involved.

Naval aviation

MiG-23s of the Soviet Air Force were transferred to the Soviet Navy on two occasions. In 1984 a full regiment of MiG-23s was deployed to Vietnam to escort naval patrols by Tupolev Tu-95 aircraft. This later became the 169th Guards Composite Air Regiment. They flew over 400 sorties from Cam Ranh airbase, staying there until 1989, when the aircraft were withdrawn and returned to the air force.

The second instance of MiG-23s serving with the Soviet Navy occurred from 1990 to 1994, when nine MiG-23UB trainers were attached to the 88th Separate Fighter Bomber Regiment of the Northern Fleet&#x27;s aviation component to train pilots for their MiG-27s.

===Syria===

====Combat against Israel (since 1973)====

The first MiG-23s were supplied to Syria in April 1974. The process of making the MiG-23 operational was complex and difficult, because of the poor manufacturing quality and unreliability of the aircraft, and the lack of technical documentation. By the end of the year, up to 13 Syrian MiG-23s had already been written off. The first MiG-23s to see combat were export variants with many limitations. Compared to the MiG-21, the aircraft was mechanically complex and expensive and also less agile. The first interceptor variant to be exported, the MiG-23MS, was equipped with the same weapons system as the older MiG-21S, and its radar was particularly vulnerable to electronic countermeasures (ECM), at which the Israelis were especially proficient.

On 13 April 1974, after almost 100 days of artillery exchanges and skirmishes along the Golan Heights, Syrian helicopters delivered commandos to attack the Israeli observation post at Jebel Sheikh. This provoked heavy clashes in the air and on the ground for almost a week. On 19 April 1974, Captain al-Masry, flying a MiG-23MS on a weapons test mission, spotted a group of IAF F-4Es and shot two of them down after firing three missiles. He was about to attack another F-4 with cannon fire, but was shot down by friendly fire from a SAM battery. Due to this success, an additional 24 MiG-23MS interceptors, as well as a similar number of MiG-23BN strike variants, were delivered to Syria during the following year. In 1977, Syria bought between 28 and 30 MiG-23MFs, and the deliveries started in 1978.

The MiG-23MF, MiG-23MS and MiG-23BN were used in combat by Syria over Lebanon between 1981 and 1985. On 26 April 1981, Syria claimed that two Israeli A-4 Skyhawks attacking a camp in Sidon were shot down by two MiG-23MSs. However, Israel does not report any loss of aircraft from this incident and no loss of aircraft was reported on that date. Russian historian Vladimir Ilyin writes that the Syrians lost six MiG-23MFs, four MiG-23MSs and 14 MiG-23BNs in June 1982. One more MiG-23 fighter was lost in July. The Israelis also claimed that they shot down two MiG-23s in 1985, which the Syrians deny. Overall, 11–13 Syrian MiG-23 fighter variants were lost in air combat from 1982 to 1985. Israel confirms only the loss of BQM-34 Firebee which was downed by Syrian MiG-23MF on 6 June 1982.

In the early 2000s, Israeli UAVs regularly flew reconnaissance missions over Lebanon, but sometimes inside Syrian airspace too. MiG-23s were often scrambled in response, and they have reportedly shot down several UAVs, starting in July 2001. Indeed, between 2001 and 2006, up to 10 Israeli UAVs were shot down over Syria each year.

====Syrian Civil War====

A former Syrian Air Force MiG-23MS became iconic of the Siege of Abu al-Duhur Airbase: on 7 March 2012, Syrian rebels used a 9K115-2 Metis-M anti-tank guided missile to hit the derelict MiG. Later, in March 2013 they entered in the base, showing the worn out and damaged MiG. Finally, in May 2013, the Syrian Air Force bombed it to completely destroy the wreck.

Syrian MiG-23BNs bombed the city of Aleppo on 24 July 2012, becoming the first use of fixed-wing aircraft for bombing in the Syrian civil war.

On 13 August 2012, a Syrian MiG-23BN was reportedly shot down by the rebels of the Free Syrian Army near Deir ez-Zor, although the government claimed that it went down due to technical difficulties.

Since then, Syrian Air Force MiG-23s together with different Syrian Air Force fighter jets have regularly been spotted performing attack runs on Syrian insurgents, who have claimed different MiGs being shot down or destroyed on the ground on different occasions.

On 23 March 2014, one Syrian MiG-23 was shot down after being hit by an AIM-9 Sidewinder fired by a Turkish F-16 in the vicinity of the Syrian town of Kessab. The pilot ejected safely and was recovered by friendly forces. Turkish sources said the fighter violated Turkish airspace and it was downed after several radio warnings while approaching the border. Another Syrian MiG-23 returned to Syria after trespassing into Turkish airspace.

On 15 June 2017, one Jordanian Selex ES Falco UAV was shot down by a Syrian MiG-23MLD in the vicinity of the Syrian town of Derra. On 16 June, another Selex ES Falco was shot down by MiG-23ML both using R-24R missiles.

On 9 September 2020, a Syrian MiG-23 crashed in Deir ez-Zor Governorate without information on the fate of its pilot.

During the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive, the insurgents managed to capture a number of derelict MiG-23 and Aero L-39 Albatros jets after the capture of Aleppo.

===Iraq===
Iraq bought its first MiG-23s in 1973, in order to replace its Hawker Hunters and MiG-17Fs. Deliveries lasted from 1974 to 1978, and consisted of 18 MiG-23MS interceptors, between 36 and 40 MiG-23BN strike aircraft, and several MiG-23UB trainers. The introduction of these new aircraft proved particularly difficult for the Iraqi Air Force. Training in the Soviet Union included little flight time, and since the Soviets didn&#x27;t provide any technical documentation or flight manuals, the Iraqis had to run flight testing on their own. Moreover, the handling qualities and the avionics outfit of the MiG-23 were heavily criticised, and the airframes&#x27; manufacturing quality was poor. Unsurprisingly, by 1978 at least 12 MiG-23s had been written off in accidents. An additional batch of MiG-23MS was bought in the late 1970s to compensate for the losses.

====Iran-Iraq War (1980–1988)====
The MiG-23 took part in the Iran–Iraq War and was used in both air-to-air and air-to-ground roles. On the first day of the war (22 September), both the MiG-23MS and the MiG-23BNs participated in attacks against Iranian airbases. The next day, an Iraqi MiG-23MS shot down an Iranian Northrop F-5E. However, this day also marked the first MiG-23 losses of the war: three MiG-23BNs were shot down by Iranian interceptors and air defences. Several more MiG-23s were shot down in the following months, mostly MiG-23BNs. The high losses were compounded by the embargo placed on Iraq by the Soviet Union in reaction to the war. By the end of 1980, Iraqi MiG-23MS pilots had claimed a total of three F-5Es shot down, all of them over the Iraqi airspace.

Despite the embargo, five MiG-23MFs that had been delivered prior to the outbreak of the war were rushed into service in the latter half of 1981. Attempting to replicate the success of the Mirage F1s that shot down two F-14 Tomcats on 15 November 1981, the pilots of Iraqi MiG-23 interceptor units started trying to sneak upon the Iranian Tomcats in a similar way a few days later. However, following these two losses, the Iranian pilots had adapted their tactics. While the F-14s flew combat air patrols at high altitude, pairs of F-5Es or F-4 Phantoms were positioned at low altitude in order to prevent Iraqi fighters from approaching the Tomcats unobserved. These new tactics worked out when two MiG-23MFs were shot down by the F-14s after having been visually detected by the F-5s, on 25 November. Several more Iraqi fighters were lost in similar circumstances during this period. MiG-23BN units continued suffering losses too, especially to F-14s and MIM-23B I-HAWK surface-to-air missiles. The Iraqi MiG-23BNs delivered in the 1970s only had a subpar radar warning receiver and no electronic countermeasures (ECM) equipment, despite the Iraqi Air Force having paid for it. In 1982, the Soviets lifted their embargo, and aircraft deliveries restarted: 18 additional MiG-23MFs were delivered, together with 18 MiG-23BNs equipped with the ECM system requested since the 1970s.

In 1983–1984, the MiG-23MFs were used to intercept Iranian RF-4E reconnaissance aircraft flying over Iraq. Even though these aircraft were unarmed, they proved very hard to catch, and each of their flights was protected by a pair of F-14s; on 1 January 1984, Tomcats shot down a MiG-23MF while escorting an RF-4E. Later that month, an RF-4E was shot down by a MiG-23MF. Another RF-4E was shot down yet again by an MiG-23MF in June. That year also marked the arrival of the first MiG-23MLs; in total, at least 64 were ordered by Iraq. On 11 August, one of the new MiG-23MLs shot down the F-14 flown by IRIAF Colonel Hashem All-e-Agha with an R-60MK missile over the Persian Gulf. Iraqi MiG-23MLs downed another Tomcat on 2 September 1986, when Iranian Air Force Captain Ahmad Moradi Talebi was shot down while attempting to defect with his F-14A.

On 20 February 1986, Colonel Abdolbaghi Darvish was shot down by an Iraqi MiG-23ML while flying his Iranian Fokker F27 Friendship (F27-600). All 51 crew and passengers were killed. The aircraft was carrying a delegation of military and government officials on a mission.

From 1984 onwards, due to the exhaustion of both its personnel and its aircraft, the Iranian air force stopped operating its fighters over the frontlines. Hence, the Iraqis started using their aircraft to attack targets further into Iran. MiG-23BNs participated in these attacks, as part of bigger strike packages including other bombers, a fighter escort (often including MiG-23MF/MLs), and SEAD aircraft. They also flew close air support missions. Thanks to the decreased presence of IRIAF interceptors and to the much-improved protection offered by escort, SEAD and electronic countermeasures aircraft, losses were much lower than during the first months of the war.

According to official post-war Iraqi Air Force documents, Iraq lost a total of 38 MiG-23BNs, three MiG-23MS, one MiG-23MF and one MiG-23ML. However, the stated losses for interceptor variants are much lower than the actual number of aircraft lost. For example, the number of pilots known to have been killed while flying MiG-23MS/MFs is twice as high as the official figure for all MiG-23 interceptor variants. In return, Iraqi MiG-23 pilots have claimed around 20 aerial victories, of which seven have been confirmed after cross-examination with data from Iranian sources.

====Kuwait Invasion and Gulf War (1990–1991)====
On 2 August 1990, the Iraqi Air Force supported the invasion of Kuwait with MiG-23BN and Su-22 aircraft as the main strike assets. A number of Iraqi aircraft and helicopters were shot down by Kuwaiti air defense MIM-23 Hawk SAM sites, among them a MiG-23BN.

Iraqi MiG-23s damaged two EF-111A Ravens by R-60 missiles during the Gulf War.

Iraqi documents captured after the invasion of Iraq revealed that they possessed 127 MiG-23s, including 38 MiG-23BNs and 21 MiG-23 trainers, at the start of Operation Desert Storm. During the Gulf War, the United States Air Force reported downing eight Iraqi MiG-23s with F-15s. Iraqi documents confirm the total destruction of 43 MiG-23s from all causes, with another 10 damaged and 12 others fleeing to Iran. This left Iraq with just 63 MiG-23s after the war, including 18 MiG-23BNs and 12 trainers.

The United States stated that the losses of the F-16Cs were caused by 2K12 Kub and S-125 Neva/Pechora surface-to-air missiles rather than enemy aircraft. Also, no Tornado loss is attributed to enemy aircraft as per the Royal Air Force and the Italian Air Force.

====No Fly Zone and invasion of Iraq (1991–2003)====
On 17 January 1993, a USAF F-16C destroyed an Iraqi MiG-23 with an AMRAAM missile. On 9 September 1999, a lone MiG-23 crossed the no-fly zone heading towards a flight of F-14s. One F-14 fired an AIM-54 Phoenix at the MiG but missed and the MiG headed back north. However, the aircraft then crashed while its pilot was attempting to land.

In 2003, during Operation Iraqi Freedom, the entire Iraqi Air Force remained grounded with several airframes found by US and allied forces around the Iraqi air bases in derelict condition after the invasion. The invasion marked the end of Iraqi service for the MiG-23.

===Cuba===

;Cuba in Angola
Cuban MiG-23MLs and South African Mirage F1 pilots had several encounters during the Cuban intervention in Angola, one of which resulted in severe damage to a Mirage F1.

On 27 September 1987, during Operation Moduler, two MiG-23 pilots surprised a pair of Mirages and fired missiles: Alberto Ley Rivas engaged a Mirage flown by Captain Arthur Douglas Piercy with a pair of R-23Rs (some sources say a R-60), while the other Cuban pilot fired a single R-60 at a Mirage flown by Captain Carlo Gagiano. Although the missiles homed on the Mirages, only one R-23R exploded close enough to cause damage to the landing hydraulics of Captain Piercy&#x27;s Mirage (and, according to some accounts, the aircraft&#x27;s drag chute). The damage likely contributed to the Mirage veering off the runway on landing, after which the nose gear collapsed. The nose hit the ground so hard that Piercy&#x27;s ejection seat fired. As a result of this ground level ejection, Piercy was paralyzed. The aircraft was written off, but a large portion of the airframe and components were used to repair another accident-damaged Mirage F1 and return it to service. In total, the Cubans claimed 6 air victories with the MiG-23 (1 destroyed, 1 damaged and 4 were unconfirmed).

Angolan MiG-23s outclassed SAAF Mirage F1CZ and F1AZ fighters in terms of power/acceleration, radar/avionics capabilities, and air-to-air weapons. The MiG-23&#x27;s R-23 and R-60 missiles gave FAPA/DAA pilots the ability to engage SAAF aircraft from most aspects. The SAAF, hobbled by an international arms embargo, was forced to carry an obsolescent version of the French Matra R.550 Magic missile or early-generation V-3 Kukri missiles, which had limited range and performance relative to the R-60 and R-23. Despite these limitations, SAAF pilots were able to vector within the firing envelope and fire air-to-air missiles at MiG-23s (gun camera shots evidence this). The missiles either missed or exploded ineffectually behind in the tail plume rather than homing on the hot airframe.

UNITA rebels, opposing Cuban/MPLA forces, shot down a number of MiG-23s with American-supplied FIM-92 Stinger MANPADS missiles. South African ground forces shot down a MiG-23, which was prosecuting a raid on the Calueque Dam, by using the &quot;Ystervark&quot; (porcupine) 20 mm AA gun.

===Libya===

Libya received a total of 54 MiG-23MS and 15 MiG-23UBs between 1975 and 1978, as well as 35 to 38 MiG-23BNs. These aircraft entered service with the 1040th, 1050th, 1060th and 1070th Squadrons. The 1040th and 1050th Squadrons were staffed by Syrian Air Force personnel.

One Libyan MiG-23MS was shot down by an Egyptian MiG-21 fighter during and immediately after the Libyan–Egyptian War in 1977 while supporting a strike on the airfield at Mersa Matruh, forcing the remaining MiG to abort the mission. In one skirmish in 1979, two LARAF MiG-23MS engaged two EAF MiG-21MF which had been upgraded to carry Western air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-9P3 Sidewinder. The Libyan pilots made the mistake of trying to outmaneuver the more nimble Egyptian MiG-21s, and one MiG-23MS was shot down by Maj. Sal Mohammad with an AIM-9P3 Sidewinder missile, while the other used its superior speed to escape.

On 18 July 1980, the wreckage of an LARAF MiG-23MS was found on the northern side of the Sila massif, in the middle of the Italian region of Calabria. The deceased pilot, Captain Ezzedin Fadhel Khalil, was found still strapped to his ejection seat.

In August 1981, Libyan MiG-23MS fighters were involved in the standoff with the US Navy which led to the first Gulf of Sidra incident, although they were not involved in any actual combats on this occasion.

In the mid-1980s, newer versions of the MiG-23 entered service with the Libyan Air Force. Around 20 MiG-23MFs were received in 1984 to re-equip the 1060th Squadron. 48 MiG-23MLDs were also ordered in the same period. Two Squadrons, the 1023rd and 1024th, were created to operate these aircraft.

Libyan MiG-23s were employed during the Chadian–Libyan conflict performing different roles, starting in 1981. During the first years of their involvement, both the MiG-23MS and MiG-23BN variants were used, almost exclusively for ground attack. Later in the war, some combat air patrols were flown too, with the more advanced MiG-23MF and MiG-23MLD variants being used as well. On 5 January 1987, a Libyan MiG-23 was shot down and few months later, on 5 September 1987, Chadian forces performed a land raid against Maaten al-Sarra Air Base in Libya, destroying several Libyan aircraft on the ground, among them, three MiG-23s. On 8 October 1987, a MiG-23BN was shot down by ground fire, with its pilot being recovered by a helicopter.

MiG-23 interceptors were also used by Libya during the action in the Gulf of Sidra in 1986. Although they were flown aggressively, with their pilots sometimes trying to get into a firing position behind the American fighters (with little success), neither the MiG-23s nor their opponents opened fire against each other.

Two Libyan MiG-23MF fighters were shot down by U.S. Navy F-14As in the Second Gulf of Sidra incident in 1989.

;Libyan Civil War
In the 2011 Libyan civil war, Libyan Air Force MiG-23s were used to bomb rebel positions. On 15 March 2011, a rebel website reported that opposition forces started using a captured MiG-23 and a helicopter to sink 2 loyalist ships and bomb some tank positions.

On 19 March 2011, a MiG-23BN of the Free Libyan Air Force was shot down over Benghazi by its own air defenses, which mistook it for a loyalist aircraft. The pilot was killed after he ejected too late.

On 26 March 2011, five MiG-23s together with two Mi-35 helicopters were destroyed by the French Air Force while parked at Misrata airport, early reports misidentified the fixed wing aircraft as G-2 Galebs.

On 9 April, a rebel MiG-23 was intercepted over Benghazi by NATO aircraft and escorted back to its base for violating the UN no-fly zone.

A limited number of MiG-23&#x27;s which survived the 2011 Libyan civil war and NATO bombings were involved in air strikes between the opposing Libyan House of Representatives and the rival General National Congress during the Second Libyan Civil War with both parties controlling a limited number of aircraft.

On 23 March 2015, a New General National Congress operated MiG-23UB was shot down while bombing Al Watiya airbase, controlled by the Libyan House of Representative probably with an Igla-S MANPADS. Both pilots were killed.
At the beginning of 2016, Libyan House of Representatives forces controlled three airworthy MiG-23s among other aircraft, two MiG-23MLA and one MiG-23UB.
They were all lost on three occasions with a first MiG-23MLA, serial 6472, lost near Benina airbase on 4 January, after an airstrike, the second MiG-23MLA, serial 6132, lost on 8 February while conducting air strikes against Islamic State near Derna and the MiG-23UB, serial 7834, lost on 12 February 2016 while operating west of Benghazi, claimed shot down by the Islamic State with the official government attributing the loss to anti aircraft artillery. In all the occasions the aircrews ejected while the cause of the first two crashes remained debated between hostile fire and mechanical causes.

On 28 February 2016, a MiG-23MLA serial 6453 was restored to flying status after several years, becoming the only MiG-23 in service with the Libyan Air Force as of March 2016, performing missions against enemy positions and vehicles since March 2016.

In the following weeks, both the Libyan National Army Air Force and the opposing Libyan Dawn Air Force, restored a number of MiG-23BN, MiG-23ML and MiG-23UB to flying status and they were recorded while flying over Libyan skies and striking enemy positions.

On 6 December 2019, a Libyan National Army (LNA) MiG-23MLD was shot down by forces loyal to the Government of National Accord (GNA). In the ongoing Libyan Civil War both parties are pushing back to service stored airframes after repairs with foreign assistance. The jet, serial 26144, was restored using the wings of two different airframes and became flyable again in August 2019, after around 20 years of storage. The jet was hit over the Yarmouk frontline in southern Tripoli and crashed in Al Zawiya city and the pilot, Amer Jagem was detained after ejecting. A video emerged showing the aircraft diving for attack with soldiers on the ground firing a Strela-2M MANPADS in response. The LNA reported they lost a MiG-23 due to technical fault, denying it crashed due to enemy fire.

===Egypt===
Egypt became one of the first export customers when it bought in 1974 eight MiG-23MS interceptors, eight MiG-23BN strikers and four MIG-23UB trainers, concentrating them into a single squadron based at Mersa Matruh. By 1975 all Egyptian MiG-23s had been withdrawn from active duty and placed in storage due to the Egyptian foreign policy shifting towards the West and thus losing USSR support.

Starting in 1978 China purchased from Egypt two MiG-23MS interceptors, two MiG-23BNs, two MiG-23UBs, ten MiG-21MFs, and ten KSR-2 (AS-5 Kelt) air-to-surface missiles in exchange for Shenyang J-6 jets, spare parts and technical support for the Egyptian fleet of Soviet-supplied MiG-17 and MiG-21s. The Chinese used the aircraft as the basis for their J-9 project, which never ventured beyond the research phase.

Some time later the remaining six MiG-23MS examples and six MiG-23BNs, as well as 16 MiG-21MFs, two Sukhoi Su-20 Fitters, two MiG-21Us, two Mil Mi-8 Hips and ten KSR-2s were purchased for the Foreign Technology Division, a special department of the USAF, responsible for evaluating adversary technologies. These were exchanged for weapons and spares support, including AIM-9J/P Sidewinder missiles, which were installed on remaining Egyptian MiG-21s.

===Ethiopia===
MiG-23s supplied by the Soviet Union to Mengistu Haile Mariam&#x27;s Derg were heavily used by the Ethiopian Air Force against the array of rebel guerillas fighting the government during the Ethiopian Civil War. According to a 1990 Human Rights Watch report, the attacks, often using napalm or phosphorus and cluster munitions, were not only aimed at the rebels, but against civilian populations (in both Eritrea and Ethiopia) and humanitarian convoys in a deliberate fashion.

Ethiopian MiG-23s were used in ground attack and strike missions during the border war with Eritrea from May 1998 to June 2000, even striking targets at the airport in the Eritrean capital city, Asmara on several occasions. Three Ethiopian MiG-23BNs were claimed shot down by Eritrean MiG-29s.

On 29 November 2020, an Ethiopian Air Force MiG-23 reportedly crashed during the Tigray conflict near Abiy Addi, 50 kilometers west of Mekelle. Unreliable images of the pilot were circulating after being captured by the Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front who claimed they shot it down, showing the pilot with his Zsh-7 flying helmet (originally intended for Su-27 and MiG-29), a flight suit, a MiG-23 English manual and the crash site with charred metal parts.

===India===

;Kargil War (1999)

On 26 May, the Indian forces started air strikes during the Kargil War. Ground attack aircraft including MiG-21, MiG-23, MiG-27, and Mirage 2000 were used to bombard Pakistani positions.

===Sudan===
Sudan received extensive military aid, including 12 MiG-23MS and one MiG-23UB from former enemy Libya starting in 1987. They quickly entered service fighting against the South Sudan People&#x27;s Defence Forces (SPLA) in 1988 during the Second Sudanese Civil War. A number of these jets were lost either to ground fire or crashed. By 1990 Libya withdrew its military advisors from Sudan and the remaining four MiG-23 jets were placed in storage. Starting from 2010, Sudan started to refurbish its MiG-23 jets locally with the help of Russia, Byelorussian and Ethiopian technicians with pictures of freshly painted and refurbished jets circling online. One crash-landed and caught fire during flight testing in 2016.

==Variants==

===First-generation===
;Ye-231:(&quot;Flogger-A&quot;) was the designation given to the prototype MiG-23 built for testing purposes. Although the experimental model featured the same basic design as later MiG-23/-27 models, it lacked the sawtooth leading edge common on later variants. It also shares design elements with the Sukhoi Su-24, although the Su-24 would go on to experience greater modification.

;MiG-23: (&quot;Flogger-A&quot;) was a pre-production model which lacked weapon hardpoints but was armed with guns and featured the sawtooth leading edge of later MiG-23s. It also marked the divergence point of the MiG-23/-27 and Su-24 designs.

;MiG-23S: (&quot;Flogger-A&quot;) was the initial production variant. An interim variant, it was externally similar to the prototype but as the Sapfir-23 had been delayed it was equipped with the RP-22SM Sapfir radar and lacked an IRST. The first MiG-23Ss were powered by an R-27F-300 turbojet with a dry thrust of and on afterburner; later version used the uprated R-27F2M-300 with a dry thrust of and on afterburner.

:The first MiG-23S took flight on 21 May 1969, and from July 1969 to mid-1973 a total of 11 MiG-23Ss were involved in protracted testing by the Ministry of Aircraft Industry and the VVS. It was during this testing phase where a number of faults with the MiG-23 were discovered - including dangerous behavior at high AoA, propensity to spin in certain circumstances, and development of cracks in the joints between the center fuselage and wings - and several accidents occurred with the loss of life. Around 60 production-standard MiG-23Ss were built between 1969 and the early 1970s. However these only saw brief front-line service with the 4th TsBPiPLS and 979th IAP before the numerous unreliability issues forced their retirement.

;MiG-23: (&quot;Flogger-A&quot;) was another interim variant which replaced the MiG-23S starting in late 1970; while known simply as the MiG-23, it was also called the MiG-23 Edition 1971. It was the first to feature the Sapfir-23 radar (albeit the unreliable Sapfir-23L model which lacked look-down/shoot-down) allowing it to fire the R-23R SARH missile, along with a TP-23 IRST and ASP-23D gunsight/HUD. A redesigned fuselage moved the tail surfaces back , added ribbed air brakes, and inserted another fuel tank with capacity. The new wing design, known as Edition 2 wings, increased surface area by 20 percent to improved wing loading but resulted in a change in sweep settings; it also added a pronounced leading-edge dogtooth but removed the leading-edge slats, making them easier to manufacture but increasing the already dangerous control and stability issues. The MiG-23 Edition 1971 was powered by a R-27F2-300 turbojet rated at dry and with afterburners.

:Around 80 MiG-23 Edition 1971s were manufactured in 1971. These briefly saw service with frontline VVS fighter regiments until eventually being assigned to a training role in 1978.

;MiG-23M: (&quot;Flogger-B&quot;) The most produced variant of the first-generation MiG-23s, the MiG-23M first flew in June 1972 and became the VVS&#x27; chief air superiority fighter, giving it a true look-down/shoot-down capability. While the first fighters were equipped with the Sapfir-23L, it was quickly succeeded by the improved Sapfir-23D (and in 1975 the Sapfir-23D-III), allowing the MiG-23M to carry a pair of R-23 missiles and R-60 missiles. Other updates to the electronics included the SAU-23A three-axis automatic flight control system/autopilot and Polyot-11-23 navigation system. An updated wing design, the definitive Edition 3 wing, retained the Edition 2&#x27;s design but added leading-edge slats back to improve handling characteristics. The variant was powered by an uprated R-27 turbojet, the Tumansky R-29-300 (&quot;izdeliye 55a&quot;), which had a dry thrust of and with afterburners. Plumbed pylons were also introduced to allow the MiG-23M to carry 800-litre drop tanks when the wings were at full spread.

:Production began at the Znamya Truda factory in 1972, and by 1974 it reached an impressive thirty-plus airframes a month, with peaks of up to forty a month. The first MiG-23Ms entered service with the 4th TsBPiPLS in 1973, soon followed by frontline VVS regiments stationed in East Germany; by the mid-1970s a small number of PVO regiments had also converted to the MiG-23M. However, problems with the airframe&#x27;s structural elements and wing sweep mechanism failures resulted in a self-imposed 5-G restriction until 1977, when quality controls and strengthening measures addressed the problem and allowed for MiG-23M squadrons to conduct basic fighter maneuvers. Around 1,300 MiG-23Ms were produced for the VVS and PVO from 1972 to 1978.

;MiG-23MF: (&quot;Flogger-B&quot;) This was an export derivative of the MiG-23M produced from 1978 to 1983 at Znamya Truda. One version (&quot;izdeliye 2A&quot; or 23-11A), intended for sale to the Warsaw Pact, was practically the same as the MiG-23M with small differences in communication and IFF equipment. The other (&quot;izdeliya 2B&quot; or 23-11B) was designed for sale for certain Third World client states. Like the 23-11A it featured the Sapfir-23D-III radar (redesignated Sapfir-23E), but lacked electronic counter-countermeasure (ECCM) features and had lower overall performance. Their communication equipment was also less powerful, with the Lasour-SMA datalink removed from some aircraft. Until 1981, these were delivered to customers with the R-13M missile instead of the R-60.

;MiG-23MS: (&quot;Flogger-E&quot;) Another export variant, the MiG-23MS was a downgrade version of the MiG-23M designed for Third World customers who couldn&#x27;t be trusted with the advanced technology of the MiG-23MF. While using the same airframe and engine as the MiG-23M, the MiG-23MS was equipped with the same weapons and equipment as the MiG-21S/SM. A downgraded export version of the RP-22SM radar gave the MiG-23MS its distinctively short nose radome, while the undernose IRST was removed. The only missiles it was capable of firing were up to four R-3S and R-3R air-to-air missiles, though the improved R-13M was added later. This variant was produced at Znamya Truda between 1973 and 1978, with fifty-four sent to Syria, eighteen to Iraq, eight to Egypt, and fifty-four to Libya. Egypt handed over several of their MiG-23MSs to China and the United States for technical evaluation.

;MiG-23MP: (&quot;Flogger-E&quot;) Virtually identical to the MiG-23MS, the only difference was that the MiG-23MP added a dielectric head above the pylon, a feature associated with ground-attack versions. A possible developmental prototype, very few were produced and none were exported.

;MiG-23U: (&quot;Flogger-C&quot;) The MiG-23U was a twin-seat training variant based on the MiG-23S, first appearing six months after the single-seater&#x27;s introduction. Its only major design difference was the addition of a second cockpit where the equipment bay was located, necessitating its movement into the redesigned nose. It retained the MiG-23S&#x27; GSh-23L gun with 200 rounds and could carry up to of bombs. Equipped with the S-21 weapon control system centered on the Sapfir-21M radar, the MiG-23U could fire the R-3S and R-13M missiles. Also like the MiG-23 Edition 1971 and MiG-23M, a fourth fuel tank was added with a capacity of 470 litres. Production of the MiG-23U began at Irkutsk in 1971 and eventually converted to the MiG-23UB.

;MiG-23UB: (&quot;Flogger-C&quot;) Another two-seat trainer, the MiG-23UB made its maiden flight on 10 April 1970, with production starting later that year at the Irkutsk Aviation Plant. It was equipped with the SAU-23UB flight control system and Polyot-11-23 navigation system, consisting of a RSBN-6S tactical aid to navigation, a SKV-2N2 reference gyro and a DV-30 and DV-10 air data system. While early production aircraft did feature the Sapfir-21M radar, it was soon replaced with ballast blocks under a conical metal fairing. Additionally, starting in 1971 production MiG-23UBs received the Edition 3 wing, and from 1979 onward those delivered to MiG-23M/ML regiments received the SOUA limiter to constrain AoA to within 28 degrees. Production of the MiG-23UB for the VVS and PVO continued until 1978, and until 1985 for export customers. More than 1,000 MiG-23UBs were produced, with 760 of these for the VVS and PVO.

===Second-generation===

;MiG-23ML: (&quot;Flogger-G&quot;, Model 23-12, Izdyelie 3) The early MiG-23 variants had a number of design shortcomings, including airframe strength and reliability, engine performance, maneuverability and radar performance. A considerable redesign of the airframe was conducted, resulting in the MiG-23ML (L - &quot;Lyogkiy&quot; or lightweight), which was given the NATO designation &quot;Flogger-G&quot;. Empty weight was reduced by removing the No. 4 fuselage fuel tank. Aerodynamics were refined for less drag, with the dorsal fin extension removed. The lighter weight of the airframe and a redesign of the main undercarriage units resulted in a different sit on the ground, with the aircraft&#x27;s nose at a lower attitude compared to the nose-high appearance of earlier variants. Structural weaknesses, in particular the wing pivot mechanism, were strengthened so that the airframe was now rated for a G-limit of 8.5 at speeds below Mach 0.85 and 7.5-G at faster speeds. This also allowed the angle of attack (AoA) limiter to be set to 20-22° with the wings fully swept back, and 28-30° otherwise.

:A new engine model, the R-35F-300, now provided a maximum dry thrust of , and with afterburner. This led to a considerably improved thrust-to-weight ratio of 0.83 (versus 0.77 for the MiG-23M), though in real-world conditions the ratio would be lower due to engine &#x27;detuning&#x27;, and a lower specific fuel consumption of 1.96 kg/kgf.h at maximum afterburn (versus 2.09 in the earlier R-27F2M-300). After initial issues of reliability, the time between overhauls was also extended to 450 hours, though like earlier engines it was limited to only ten hours at full military power or afterburner.

:The avionics set was considerably improved as well. The S-23ML standard included Sapfir-23ML radar and TP-23M IRST. The Polyot-21-23 navigation suite, Lasour-23SML datalink, SAU-23AM flight control system, and RV-5R Reper-M radar altimeter were all improvements on previous systems. Thanks to the new SUV-2ML weapons system, the MiG-23ML could carry both types of R-23 BVR missiles, and the underwing pylons could accommodate UPK-23-250 23mm gun pods.

:Overall the MiG-23ML&#x27;s combat effectiveness was about 20 per cent better than the MiG-23M according to Mikoyan OKB. Instantaneous turn rate was 16.7° per second at a corner speed of and 27° AoA; average rate of turn was 14.1° per second. Completing a 360° turn at an altitude of took 27 seconds at an average of 6.5-G, with an entry speed of and final speed of . At the same altitude, accelerating from to at full afterburn took 12 seconds, while the rate of climb was , though this fell off as altitude increased. In total, the time it took a MiG-23ML to take off and reach while accelerating to Mach 2.1 on full afterburner was 4.3 minutes.

:The MiG-23ML prototype first took flight on 21 January 1975 and quickly entered mass production later that same year, though export customers continued to receive the MiG-23MF for another seven years. More than 1,100 MiG-23MLs (and its derivatives including the MiG-23MLA) were built for Soviet and export users between 1978 and 1983.

;MiG-23MLA: (&quot;Flogger-G&quot;) The later production variant of the &quot;ML&quot; was designated the &quot;MiG-23MLA&quot;. The fighter first flew in 1977, with mass production beginning in 1978 and sales to foreign customers starting in 1981. Externally, the &quot;MLA&quot; was identical to &quot;ML&quot;. Internally, the &#x27;MLA&#x27; had an improved Sapfir-23MLA (N003) radar with better range, reliability and ECM resistance, and a frequency spacing feature which made co-operative group search operations possible as the radars would now not jam each other. It also had a new ASP-17ML HUD/gunsight, and starting in 1981 the capability to fire improved Vympel R-24R/T missiles. A TP-23M IRST was included, which had a maximum detection range of for a high-altitude fighter-sized target operating at full power, or for a bomber-sized target. However its field of scanning was restricted compared to the radar: only 60° in azimuth and 15° in elevation. As with the MiG-23MF, there were two different MiG-23ML sub-variants for export: the first version was sold to Warsaw Pact countries and was very similar to Soviet aircraft. The second variant had downgraded radar and it was sold to Third World allies.

;MiG-23P: (&quot;Flogger-L&quot;, Model 23-14, Izdyelie 6) This was a specialized air-defense interceptor variant developed for the PVO Strany as an interim low-cost stopgap, replacing the Su-9/Su-11 and MiG-19P/PM still in service. The MiG-23P (P - &quot;Perekhvatchik&quot; or interceptor) had the same airframe and powerplant as the MiG-23ML, but its avionics suite was improved to meet PVO requirements and mission profiles. Its radar was the improved Sapfir-23P (N006), which could be used in conjunction with the ASP-23P gunsight/HUD (later replaced with the improved ASP-23ML-P) for better look-down/shoot-down capabilities to counter increasing low-level threats like F-111s. The IRST however was removed. The SAU-23P autopilot included a new digital computer which, operating in conjunction with the Lasur-M datalink, enabled ground-controlled interception (GCI) ground stations to steer the aircraft towards the target; in such an intercept, all the pilot had to do was control the engine and use the weapons. The MiG-23P was the most numerous PVO interceptor in the 1980s - around 500 manufactured between 1978 and 1981 - but was never exported. It also endured after the break-up of the Soviet Union, with the last MiG-23P units operating until 1998. Interestingly, in mock BVR air combat the MiG-23P when flown by experienced pilots proved to be equal or even better than the Su-27.

;MiG-23&quot;bis&quot;: (&quot;Flogger-L&quot;) Similar to the MiG-23P except the IRST was restored and the cumbersome radar scope replaced with a new HUD.

;MiG-23MLD: (&quot;Flogger-K&quot;, Model 23-18) The MiG-23MLD was the ultimate fighter variant of the MiG-23. The main focus of the upgrade was to improve maneuverability, especially during high AoA, which was identified as the MiG-23M/ML&#x27;s chief shortcoming. The pitot boom was equipped with vortex generators, and the wing&#x27;s notched leading edge roots were &#x27;saw-toothed&#x27; to act as vortex generators as well. The flight-control system incorporated the SOS-3-4 synthetic stick-stop device/signals limiter being used on the MiG-29 to improve handling and safety in high-AoA maneuvers. A strengthening of the wing pivot allowed the addition of a fourth wing sweep position of 33°, which was intended to reduce turn radius and allow for rapid deceleration during dogfights. However, with the wings at the 33° position, the MiG-23MLD was much more difficult to handle and suffered from poor acceleration. Moving the wings to this position was primarily reserved for experienced MiG-23 pilots, while combat manuals continued to emphasize the 45° position.

:Significant improvements were made in avionics, with the incorporation of the Sapfir-23MLA-II (N008) radar which featured greater range, reliability, ECM resistance and improved modes for look-down/shoot-down over rough terrain. The radar also featured a close-in fighting mode with vertical-scan capability covering a narrow sector in front of the fighter. Against a bomber-sized target operating at medium to high altitudes, the Sapfire-23MLA-II had a maximum detection range of . Other improvements included the SPO-15L Beryoza radar warning receiver, A-321 Klystron digital tactical radio navigation/automatic landing system, SAU-23-18 automatic flight control system, and SARP-12-24 crash-resistant flight recorder. Survivability was improved with a pair of six-round downward-firing chaff/flare dispensers mounted in the underfuselage centerline pylon, complemented by the two thirty-round upward-firing BVP-50-60 chaff/flare dispenser.

:No new-build &quot;MLD&quot; aircraft were delivered to the VVS, as the more advanced MiG-29 was about to enter production. Instead, all Soviet &quot;MLD&quot;s were former &quot;ML/MLA&quot; aircraft modified to &quot;MLD&quot; standard, with 560 examples being converted at three VVS maintenance facilities in Kubinka, Chuhuiv and Lviv from May 1982 to May 1985. As with earlier MiG-23 versions, two distinct export variants were offered. Unlike Soviet examples, these were new-build aircraft, though they lacked the aerodynamic refinements of Soviet &quot;MLD&quot;s; 16 examples were delivered to Bulgaria, and 50 to Syria between 1982 and 1984. These were the last single-seat MiG-23 fighters made.

===Ground-attack variants===
;MiG-23B: (&quot;Flogger-F&quot;) Created to meet the need for a new fighter-bomber, the MiG-23B was similar to the MiG-23S but with a redesigned forward fuselage and a dielectric head just above the pylon. In the flat-bottomed, tapered-down nose was a PrNK Sokol-23 ground attack sight system in place of the radar. The system included an analogue computer, a laser rangefinder and a PBK-3 bomb sight. The navigation suite and autopilot were updated to provide more accurate bombing, while the pylons were strengthened to increase the maximum bomb payload to 3,000 kg. To improve the fighter&#x27;s survivability, the Flogger-F was fitted with an electronic warfare (EW) suite, and an inert gas system was placed in the fuel tanks to prevent fires. The pilot&#x27;s survivability and visibility was also enhanced by raising their seat and armoring the cockpit windscreen. Instead of the R-29 engine, the MiG-23B was fitted with the Lyulka AL-21 turbojet.

:The first prototype of the MiG-23B, &quot;32-34&quot;, flew on 20 August 1970. While it was fitted with same wing design as the MiG-23S, all subsequent models had the improved Edition 2 design. However, because the AL-21 was needed for the Sukhoi Su-17 and Su-24, only three prototypes and 24 production aircraft of the MiG-23B were produced between 1971 and 1972. Restrictions on the AL-21 also prevented the MiG-23B from being exported to foreign customers.

;MiG-23B: (&quot;Flogger-A&quot;) The first Flogger attack variant was powered by the AL-21F. Only 24 were produced, due to a lack of engines (the AL-21F was destined for the Sukhoi Su-17/22 and the Su-24 Fencer). It was armed with the GSh-23L cannon, carrying 200 rounds.

;MiG-23BK: (&quot;Flogger-H&quot;) An export variant reserved for Warsaw Pact countries. In addition to the PrNK-23 system, additional radar warning receivers were mounted on the intakes.

;MiG-23BN: (&quot;Flogger-H&quot;) An upgraded version of the MiG-23B, the MiG-23BN differed in that it was fitted with the Edition 3 wings and R-29 engine of contemporary fighter variants, along with minor updates in electronics and equipment. The other major difference was the removal of the dielectric head found on the MiG-23B. Produced from 1973 to 1985, a total of 624 MiG-23BNs were built, although only a small number served in VVS units with the rest exported. A downgraded version intended for Third World customers proved to be fairly popular and effective. The last MiG-23BN in Indian service flew on 6 March 2009, flown by Wing Commander Tapas Ranjan Sahu of the 221 Squadron (Valiants).

;MiG-23BM experimental aircraft: (&quot;Flogger-D&quot;) The predecessor to the MiG-27, this experimental variant differed from the standard MiG-23BM in that its dielectric heads were moved from the pylons to directly on the wing roots.

;MiG-27 (MiG-23BM): (&quot;Flogger-D&quot;) Introduced in 1975, simplified ground-attack version with simple pitot air intakes, no radar and a simplified engine with two position afterburner nozzle. An upgrade of the MiG-23BK, the MiG-23BM replaced the original PrNK-23 with the PrNK-23M and the analog computer with a digital computer. Introduced into service as the MiG-27. 

===Proposed variants and upgrades===
;MiG-23R: A proposed reconnaissance variant which was never finished.
;MiG-23MLGD (23-35): A subvariant of the MiG-23MLD, featuring new radar, electronic warfare equipment, and helmet-mounted display, partly the same as the MiG-29.
;MiG-23MLG (23-37): A subvariant of the MiG-23MLD, electronic warfare equipment, R-73 missile.
;MiG-23MLS (23-47): A subvariant of the MiG-23MLD, electronic warfare equipment, R-73 missile.
;MiG-23MLGD (23-57): A subvariant of the MiG-23MLD.
;MiG-23K: A carrier-borne fighter variant based on the MiG-23ML, it was cancelled after the cancellation and subsequent redesign of the Soviet aircraft carrier project.
;MiG-23A: A multi-role variant based on the MiG-23K, it was planned for three sub-variants: the MiG-23AI (fighter), MiG-23AB (ground-attack), and MiG-23AR (reconnaissance). The variant was cancelled for the same reason as the MiG-23K.
;MiG-23MLK: A proposed variant which would be fitted with either two new R-33 engines or one R-100 engine.
;MiG-23MD: A modification of the MiG-23M which would have been equipped with a Saphir-23MLA-2 radar.
;MiG-23ML-1: A variant which would&#x27;ve been armed with the new R-146 missile and one of several engine configurations: a single R-100, an R-69F, or twin R-33 engines.
;MiG-23-98: A proposed series of upgrades to the MiG-23 offered by Mikoyan in the late 1990s. At a cost of around US$1 million, it included new radar, self-defense suite and avionics, along with improved cockpit ergonomics, helmet-mounted display, and the ability to fire Vympel R-27 (NATO: AA-10 &quot;Alamo&quot;) and Vympel R-77 (NATO: AA-12 &quot;Adder&quot;) missiles. For a lesser price, the existing Sapfir-23 would be improved along with newer missiles and other avionics. Airframe life extension was offered as well.
;MiG-23-98-2: An export upgrade offered to Angolan MiG-23MLs, improving the radar so they could fire new types of air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons.
;MiG-23LL: (flying laboratory) These MiG-23s were constructed to test a new in-cockpit warning system which used a female voice to warn pilots about various flight parameters. A female voice was chosen specifically to provide a distinction from ground communication, which in Soviet service was virtually always male.

<doc id="220187" wikidata="Q1073854" url="?curid=220187" title="Yoko Shimomura">
<text>is a Japanese composer and pianist primarily known for her work in video games such as the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series. She graduated from the Osaka College of Music in 1988 and began working in the video game industry by joining Capcom the same year. She wrote music for several games there, including &quot;Final Fight&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, and &quot;The King of Dragons&quot;. 

Shimomura left Capcom and joined Square (now Square Enix) in 1993, with her first project there being &quot;Live A Live&quot;. She would later become better known for writing the music for &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, which was her last game at Square before leaving to become a freelancer in 2002. Despite leaving, she has continued to work with them in later &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; entries and other games such as &quot;The 3rd Birthday&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot;.

Other well-known games Shimomura has worked on include &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot;, the &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi&quot; series, &quot;Parasite Eve&quot;, &quot;Legend of Mana&quot;, &quot;Radiant Historia&quot;, and &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles&quot;. Her works have gained a great deal of popularity and have been performed in multiple video game music concerts. Music from several of her games have been published as arranged albums and piano scores. She is also a member of the music label Brave Wave Productions.
==Early life==
Shimomura was born on October 19, 1967, in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. She developed an interest for music at a young age, and started taking piano lessons &quot;at the age of four or five&quot;. She began composing her own music by playing the piano randomly and pretending to compose, eventually coming up with her own pieces, the first of which she says she still remembers how to play. Shimomura attended Osaka College of Music, and graduated as a piano major in 1988.

Upon graduation, Shimomura intended to become a piano instructor and was extended a job offer to become a piano teacher at a music store, but as she had been an avid gamer for many years she decided to send some samples of her work to various video game companies that were recruiting at the university. Capcom invited her in for an audition and interview, and she was offered a job there. Her family and instructors were dismayed with her change in focus, as video game music was not well respected, and &quot;they had paid [her] tuition for an expensive music school and couldn&#x27;t understand why [she] would accept such a job&quot;, but Shimomura accepted the job at Capcom anyway.

==Career==

While working for Capcom, Shimomura contributed to the soundtracks of over 16 games, including the successful &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, which she composed all but three pieces for. The first soundtrack she worked on at the company was for &quot;Samurai Sword&quot; in 1988. &quot;Final Fight&quot;, in 1989, was her first work to receive a separate soundtrack album release, on an album of music from several Capcom games. The first soundtrack album to exclusively feature her work came a year later for the soundtrack to &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;. While she began her tenure at Capcom working on games for video game consoles, by 1990 she had moved to the arcade game division. She was a member of the company&#x27;s in-house band Alph Lyla, which played various Capcom game music, including pieces written by Shimomura. She performed live with the group on a few occasions, including playing piano during Alph Lyla&#x27;s appearance at the 1992 Game Music Festival.

In 1993, Shimomura left Capcom to join another game company, Square. She stated that the move was done because she was interested in writing &quot;classical-style&quot; music for fantasy role-playing games. While working for Capcom, she was in the arcade department and was unable to transfer to the console department to work on their role-playing video game series &quot;Breath of Fire&quot;, although she did contribute one track to the first game in the series. Her first project at Square was the score for the role-playing video game &quot;Live A Live&quot; in 1994. While she was working on the score to &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; the following year, she was asked to join Noriko Matsueda on the music to the futuristic role-playing game &quot;Front Mission&quot;. Although she was overworked doing both scores and it was not the genre that she was interested in, she found herself unable to refuse after her first attempt to do so unexpectedly happened in the presence of the president of Square, Tetsuo Mizuno. These games were followed by &quot;Tobal No. 1&quot;, the last score she worked on with another composer for a decade.

Over the next few years, she composed the soundtrack to several games, including &quot;Parasite Eve&quot; and &quot;Legend of Mana&quot;. Of all her compositions, Shimomura considers the soundtrack to &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; the one that best expresses herself and the soundtrack remains Shimomura&#x27;s personal favourite. &quot;Parasite Eve&quot; on the PlayStation had the first soundtrack by Shimomura that included a vocal song, as it was the first game she had written for running on a console system that had the sound capability for one. In 2002 she wrote the score for &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, which she has said is the most &quot;special&quot; soundtrack to her, as well as a turning point in her career; she named the soundtracks to &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; and &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; as the other two significant points in her life as a composer.

&quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; was wildly successful, shipping more than four million copies worldwide; Shimomura&#x27;s music was frequently cited as one of the highlights of the game, and the title track has been ranked as the fourth-best role-playing game title track of all time. The soundtrack has led to two albums of piano arrangements. &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; was the last soundtrack that she worked on at Square. After the release of &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; in 2002, Shimomura left Square for maternity leave, and began work as a freelancer in 2003. She has built on the work she did while at Square; since leaving she has composed or is composing music for eleven &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; games and Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi&quot; series. She has also worked on many other projects, such as &quot;Heroes of Mana&quot; and various arranged albums. In February 2014, Shimomura played piano at a retrospective 25th anniversary concert at Tokyo FM Hall. She performed songs from games such as &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, &quot;Live a Live&quot;, and &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;. During the &quot;Beware the Forest&#x27;s Mushrooms&quot; performance from &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot;, Shimomura was joined onstage by fellow composer Yasunori Mitsuda, who played the Irish bouzouki. She most recently composed and produced the majority of the score for &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot;, which she began writing for in 2006, a decade before the game was released. She is also a member of the music label Brave Wave Productions.

==Legacy==
Shimomura has been cited as one of the most well-known video game music composers. Shimomura&#x27;s best works compilation album, titled &quot;Drammatica: The Very Best of Yoko Shimomura&quot;, was released in March 2008. The album contains compositions from &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; and many other games she worked on in full orchestration, with Shimomura stating that she chose music that was popular among fans and well-suited for orchestration, but had never been performed by an orchestra before. In a 2008 interview with Music4Games regarding the project, Shimomura commented that with the sheet music generated for the project, she would be interested in pursuing a live performance of &quot;Drammatica&quot; for fans if the opportunity arose. In March 2009, that wish was realized when it was announced that Arnie Roth would conduct the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra at the concert Sinfonia Drammatica in the Stockholm Concert Hall, which would combine music from the album with performances of Chris Hülsbeck&#x27;s Symphonic Shades concert. The concert took place in August 2009. In March 2007, Shimomura released her first non-video game album, &quot;Murmur&quot;, an album of vocal songs sung by Chata.

Shimomura&#x27;s music for &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; made up one fourth of the music of the Symphonic Fantasies concerts in September 2009, which were produced by the creators of the Symphonic Game Music Concert series and conducted by Arnie Roth. &quot;Legend of Mana&quot;″s title theme was also performed by the Australian Eminence Symphony Orchestra for its classical gaming music concert &quot;A Night in Fantasia 2007&quot;.

Music from the original soundtrack of &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; was arranged for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing. Two compilation books of music from the series have also been published as &quot;Seiken Densetsu Best Collection Piano Solo Sheet Music&quot; first and second editions, with the second including Shimomura&#x27;s tracks from &quot;Legend of Mana&quot;. All songs in each book have been rewritten by Asako Niwa as beginning to intermediate level piano solos, though they are meant to sound as much like the originals as possible. Additionally, piano sheet music from &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; has been published as music books by Yamaha Music Media.

Shimomura&#x27;s first dedicated concert performance outside Japan was held at the Salle Cortot in Paris in November 2015. Later that same month, she performed at the El Plaza Condesa in Mexico City. In September 2016, some of her music for &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot; was performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London, as well as in Boston, with Shimomura herself performing on piano. Shimomura composed for the concert work &quot;&quot;. Her work was performed by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra and filmed at the Stockholm Concert Hall in 2021, with more performances in other locations starting in 2022. She was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2024 Game Developers Choice Awards.

==Musical style and influences==
Shimomura lists Ludwig van Beethoven, Frédéric Chopin, and Maurice Ravel as some of her influences on her personal website. She has also stated that she has enjoyed &quot;lounge-style jazz&quot; for a long time. Despite these influences and her classical training, the diverse musical styles that she has used throughout her career and sometimes in the same soundtrack include &quot;rock, electronica, oriental, ambient, industrial, pop, symphonic, operatic, chiptune, and more&quot;. She draws inspiration for her songs from things in her life that move her emotionally, which she describes as &quot;a beautiful picture, scenery, tasting something delicious, scents that bring back memories, happy and sad things... Anything that moves my emotion gives me inspiration&quot;. Shimomura has also stated that she comes up with most of her songs when she is doing something that is &quot;not part of [her] daily routine, like traveling.&quot; Although her influences are mostly classical, she has said that in her opinion her &quot;style has changed dramatically over the years, though the passion for music stays the same.&quot; Shimomura has said that she believes that an important part of &quot;the creative process behind music&quot; is to &quot;convey a subtle message, something that comes from your imagination and sticks with the listener, without being overly specific about what it means&quot;, rather than only writing simple themes with obvious messages. She stated her favorite composition was &quot;Dearly Beloved&quot; from &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;.

<text>Clifford Everett &quot;Bud&quot; Shank Jr. (May 27, 1926 – April 2, 2009) was an American alto saxophonist and flautist. He rose to prominence in the early 1950s playing lead alto and flute in Stan Kenton&#x27;s Innovations in Modern Music Orchestra and throughout the decade worked in various small jazz combos. He spent the 1960s as a first-call studio musician in Hollywood. In the 1970s and 1980s, he performed regularly with the L. A. Four. Shank ultimately abandoned the flute to focus exclusively on playing jazz on the alto saxophone. He also recorded on tenor and baritone sax. His most famous recording is probably the version of &quot;Harlem Nocturne&quot; used as the theme song in &quot;Mickey Spillane&#x27;s Mike Hammer&quot;. He is also known for the soundtrack recordings with his group to the surfing films of Bruce Brown in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and for the alto flute solo on the song &quot;California Dreamin&quot; recorded by the Mamas &amp; the Papas in 1965.

==Biography==
Bud Shank was born in Dayton, Ohio, United States. He began playing the clarinet in Vandalia, Ohio, but switched to saxophone before attending the University of North Carolina. While at UNC, Shank was initiated into the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. In 1946, he worked with Charlie Barnet before moving on to Kenton and the West coast jazz scene. He also had a strong interest in what might now be termed world music, playing Brazilian-influenced jazz with Laurindo Almeida in 1953 and 1954. In 1958, he became the first American jazz musician to record in Italy, with an Italian jazz orchestra conducted by Ezio Leoni (aka Len Mercer), paving the way for Chet Baker and others who would follow Shank&#x27;s tracks recording in Milan with Maestro Leoni. In 1958 and 1960, Shank provided the soundtracks for two Bruce Brown surf movies: &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; and &quot;Barefoot Adventure&quot;. His world music collaborations continued in 1962, fusing jazz with Indian traditions in collaboration with Indian composer and sitar player Ravi Shankar.

In 1974, Shank joined with Ray Brown, Shelly Manne (replaced by Jeff Hamilton after 1977), and Laurindo Almeida to form the group the L.A. Four, who recorded and toured extensively through 1982. Shank helped to popularize both Latin-flavored and chamber jazz music, and as a musician&#x27;s musician also performed with orchestras as diverse as the Royal Philharmonic, the New American Orchestra, the Gerald Wilson Big Band, Stan Kenton&#x27;s Neophonic Orchestra, and Duke Ellington.

In 2005, he formed the Bud Shank Big Band in Los Angeles to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Stan Kenton&#x27;s Neophonic Orchestra.

A documentary film about Shank, &quot;Bud Shank: Against the Tide (Portrait of a Jazz Legend)&quot;, was produced and directed by Graham Carter and released by Jazzed Media as a DVD (with a companion CD) in 2008. The film has been awarded four indie film awards including an Aurora Awards Gold.

Shank died on April 2, 2009, of a pulmonary embolism at his home in Tucson, Arizona, one day after returning from San Diego, California, where he was recording a new album.

<doc id="220195" wikidata="Q539832" url="?curid=220195" title="Yusef Lateef">
<text>Yusef Abdul Lateef (born William Emanuel Huddleston; October 9, 1920 – December 23, 2013) was an American jazz multi-instrumentalist, composer, and prominent figure among the Ahmadiyya Community in the United States.

Although Lateef&#x27;s main instruments were the tenor saxophone and flute, he also played oboe and bassoon, both rare in jazz, and non-western instruments such as the bamboo flute, shanai, shofar, xun, arghul and koto. He is known for having been an innovator in the blending of jazz with &quot;Eastern&quot; music. Peter Keepnews, in his &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary of Lateef, wrote that the musician &quot;played world music before world music had a name&quot;.

Lateef&#x27;s books included two novellas titled &quot;A Night in the Garden of Love&quot; and &quot;Another Avenue&quot;, the short story collections &quot;Spheres&quot; and &quot;Rain Shapes&quot;, and his autobiography, &quot;The Gentle Giant,&quot; written in collaboration with Herb Boyd. Along with his record label YAL Records, Lateef owned Fana Music, a music publishing company. He published his own work through Fana, including &quot;Yusef Lateef&#x27;s Flute Book of the Blues&quot; and many of his orchestral compositions.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Lateef was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, as William Emanuel Huddleston. His family moved, in 1923, to Lorain, Ohio, and again in 1925, to Detroit, Michigan, where his father changed the family&#x27;s name to Evans.

Throughout his early life, Lateef came into contact with many Detroit-based jazz musicians who gained prominence, including vibraphonist Milt Jackson, bassist Paul Chambers, drummer Elvin Jones and guitarist Kenny Burrell. Lateef was a proficient saxophonist by the time of his graduation from high school at the age of 18, when he launched his professional career and began touring with a number of swing bands. The first instrument he bought was an alto saxophone but after a year he switched to the tenor saxophone, influenced by the playing of Lester Young.

In 1949, he was invited by Dizzy Gillespie to tour with his orchestra. In 1950, Lateef returned to Detroit and began his studies in composition and flute at Wayne State University.

It was during this period that he converted to Islam as a member of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community and changed his name. He twice made the pilgrimage to Mecca.

===Prominence===
Lateef began recording as a leader in 1957 for Savoy Records, a non-exclusive association which continued until 1959; the earliest of Lateef&#x27;s album&#x27;s for the Prestige subsidiary New Jazz overlap with them. Musicians such as Wilbur Harden (trumpet, flugelhorn), bassist Herman Wright, drummer Frank Gant, and pianist Hugh Lawson were among his collaborators during this period. In 1960, they played an extended gig at the Minor Key, a non-alcoholic club at Dexter and Burlingame in Detroit.

By 1961, with the recording of &quot;Into Something&quot; and &quot;Eastern Sounds&quot;, Lateef&#x27;s dominant presence within a group context had emerged. His &quot;Eastern&quot; influences are clearly audible in all of these recordings, with spots for instruments like the rahab, shanai, arghul, koto and a collection of Chinese wooden flutes and bells along with his tenor and flute. Even his use of the western oboe sounds exotic in this context; it is not a standard jazz instrument. Indeed, the tunes themselves are a mixture of jazz standards, blues and film music usually performed with a piano/bass/drums rhythm section in support. Lateef made numerous contributions to other people&#x27;s albums, including during his period as a member of saxophonist Cannonball Adderley&#x27;s Quintet during 1962–64.

In the late 1960s, he began to incorporate contemporary soul and gospel phrasing into his music (albeit with a strong blues underlay) on albums such as &quot;Detroit&quot; and &quot;Hush &#x27;N&#x27; Thunder&quot;, presaging the emergence of jazz fusion. Lateef expressed a dislike of the terms &quot;jazz&quot; and &quot;jazz musician&quot; as musical generalizations. As is so often the case with such generalizations, the use of these terms does understate the breadth of his sound. In the 1980s, Lateef experimented with new-age and spiritual elements.

In 1960, Lateef returned to school, studying flute at the Manhattan School of Music in New York City. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in music in 1969 and a master&#x27;s degree in music education in 1970. Starting in 1971, he taught courses in &quot;autophysiopsychic music&quot; at the Manhattan School of Music, and he became an associate professor at the Borough of Manhattan Community College in 1972.

In 1975, Lateef received an Ed.D. from the University of Massachusetts Amherst; his dissertation was a comparative study of Western and Islamic education. Thereafter, he served as a senior research fellow at the Center for Nigerian Cultural Studies at Ahmadu Bello University throughout the early 1980s. Returning to the United States in 1986, he took a joint faculty appointment at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Hampshire College.

=== Later career ===

His 1987 album &quot;Yusef Lateef&#x27;s Little Symphony&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best New Age Recording His core influences, however, were clearly rooted in jazz, and in his own words: &quot;My music is jazz.&quot;

In 1992, Lateef founded YAL Records. In 1993, he was commissioned by the WDR Radio Orchestra Cologne to compose &quot;The African American Epic Suite&quot;, a four-part work for orchestra and quartet, based on themes of slavery and disfranchisement in the United States. The piece has since been performed by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra.

In 2005, Nicolas Humbert &amp; Werner Penzel, directors of &quot;Step Across The Border&quot;, filmed Brother Yusef, in his wooden house in the middle of a forest in Massachusetts. In 2010, he received the lifetime Jazz Master Fellowship Award from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), an independent federal agency. Established in 1982, the National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters award is the highest honor given in jazz.

The Manhattan School of Music, where Lateef had earned a bachelor&#x27;s and a master&#x27;s degree, awarded him its Distinguished Alumni Award in 2012.

His last albums were recorded for Adam Rudolph&#x27;s Meta Records. To the end of his life, Lateef continued to teach at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Smith College, and Hampshire College in western Massachusetts. Lateef died of prostate cancer on the morning of December 23, 2013, at the age of 93, survived by his wife, Ayesha, and son, Yusef.

Following his death, Lateef&#x27;s family auctioned off many of his instruments, in the hopes that they would continue to be played. Woodwind player Jeff Coffin purchased Lateef&#x27;s main tenor saxophone. as well as his bass flute.

In October 2020, the UMass Fine Arts Center celebrated the centenary of Lateef&#x27;s birth by producing &quot;Yusef Lateef: A Centenary Celebration&quot;, a major online exhibit of his work curated by Glenn Siegel and others. The centenary includes &quot;100 Responses to Yusef Lateef&quot;, a series of video tributes by many prominent artists and former Lateef collaborators and students.

==Personal life==
Lateef said that what he remembered most about his childhood was &quot;My passion for nature.&quot;

In 1980, Lateef declared that he would no longer perform any place where alcohol was served. In 1999, he said: &quot;Too much blood, sweat and tears have been spilled creating this music to play it where people are smoking, drinking and talking.&quot;

Lateef&#x27;s first wife, Tahira, predeceased him, as did a son and a daughter.

<doc id="220198" wikidata="Q11722446" url="?curid=220198" title="Mons pubis">
<text>In human anatomy, and in mammals in general, the mons pubis or pubic mound (also known simply as the mons , and known specifically in females as the mons Venus or mons veneris) is a rounded mass of fatty tissue found over the pubic symphysis of the pubic bones.

==Structure==
For females, the &quot;mons pubis&quot; forms the anterior and superior portion of the vulva. It divides into the labia majora (literally &quot;larger lips&quot;), on either side of the furrow known as the &quot;pudendal cleft&quot; that surrounds the rest of the vulvar parts: labia minora, clitoris, urinary meatus, vaginal opening, and vulval vestibule.

Although present in both men and women, the &quot;mons pubis&quot; tends to be larger in women. Its fatty tissue is sensitive to estrogen, causing a distinct mound to form with the onset of female puberty. This pushes the forward portion of the labia majora out and away from the pubic bone. The mound also becomes covered with pubic hair. It often becomes less prominent with the decrease in bodily estrogen experienced during menopause.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;mons pubis&quot; is derived from Latin for &quot;pubic mound&quot;. The more specifically female &quot;mons Venus&quot; or &quot;mons veneris&quot; is derived from Latin for &quot;mound of Venus&quot;.

== Society and culture ==

Although not part of external genitalia itself, the pubic mound can be regarded as an erogenous zone and is highly eroticized in many cultures. Throughout history, the complete or partial removal of pubic hair has been common in many societies, and more recently it has become widespread in the Western world. The removal of all pubic hair has become common practice in the past decade primarily due to societal pressures and personal preferences. There are several popular removal methods including shaving and waxing, such as a Brazilian wax.

In some circumstances, the mons veneris is subjected to aesthetic ideals beyond hair removal. Correspondingly, plastic surgery is offered, which alters the shape of the mons to a desired ideal. Desired ideals may be influenced by personal preferences, current cultural norms, or societal pressures.

Permanent forms of decoration to enhance the aesthetic appeal of this area are &quot;hanabira&quot; (the application of cosmetic scars) or piercings such as the Christina piercing or the Nefertiti piercing. Vajazzling refers to the non-permanent decoration of the &quot;mons pubis&quot; with crystal ornaments. Traditional ink tattoos are also common in this area as well as temporary henna designs or mehndi.

Although it is usually illegal to expose the &quot;mons pubis&quot; in public, there are some garments that expose it. For example, in 1985, four weeks before his death, Rudi Gernreich unveiled the pubikini, a topless bathing suit that exposed the wearer&#x27;s &quot;mons pubis&quot; and pubic hair. It was a thin, V-shaped, thong-style bottom that in the front featured a tiny strip of fabric. The pubikini was described as a &quot;pièce de résistance&quot; totally freeing the human body.

<doc id="220200" wikidata="Q27515" url="?curid=220200" title="Oystercatcher">
<text>The oystercatchers are a group of waders forming the family Haematopodidae, which has a single genus, Haematopus. They are found on coasts worldwide apart from the polar regions and some tropical regions of Africa and South East Asia. The exceptions to this are the Eurasian oystercatcher, the South Island oystercatcher, and the Magellanic oystercatcher, which also breed inland, far inland in some cases. In the past there has been a great deal of confusion as to the species limits, with discrete populations of all black oystercatchers being afforded specific status but pied oystercatchers being considered one single species.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Haematopus&quot; was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; to accommodate a single species, the Eurasian oystercatcher &quot;Haematopus ostralegus&quot;. The genus name &quot;Haematopus&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek words &quot;haima&quot; meaning blood, and &quot;pous&quot; meaning foot, referring to the red legs of the Eurasian oystercatcher; it had been in use since Pierre Belon in 1555. The family Haematopodidae was introduced (as the subfamily Haematopodinae) by the French naturalist Charles Bonaparte in 1838.

The common name &quot;oystercatcher&quot; was coined by Mark Catesby in 1731 for the North American species &quot;H. palliatus&quot;, which he described as eating oysters. The English zoologist William Yarrell in 1843 established this as the preferred term, replacing the older name &quot;sea pie&quot;, although the term had earlier been used by the Welsh Naturalist Thomas Pennant in 1776 in his &quot;British Zoology&quot;.

==Description==
The different species of oystercatcher show little variation in shape or appearance. They range from in length and in wingspan. The Eurasian oystercatcher is the lightest on average, at , while the sooty oystercatcher is the heaviest, at . The plumage of all species is either all-black, or black (or dark brown) on top and white underneath. 

The variable oystercatcher is slightly exceptional in being either all-black or pied. They are large, obvious, and noisy plover-like birds, with massive long orange or red bills used for smashing or prying open molluscs. The bill shape varies between species, according to the diet. Those birds with blade-like bill tips pry open or smash mollusc shells, and those with pointed bill tips tend to probe for annelid worms. They show sexual dimorphism, with females being longer-billed and heavier than males.

==Feeding==
The diet of oystercatchers varies with location. Species occurring inland feed upon earthworms and insect larvae. The diet of coastal oystercatchers is more varied, although dependent upon coast type; on estuaries, bivalves, the ivygastropods and polychaete worms are the most important part of the diet, whereas rocky shore oystercatchers prey upon limpets, mussels, gastropods, and chitons. Other prey items include echinoderms, fish, and crabs.

==Breeding==

Nearly all species of oystercatcher are monogamous, although there are reports of polygamy in the Eurasian oystercatcher. They are territorial during the breeding season (with a few species defending territories year round). There is strong mate and site fidelity in the species that have been studied, with one record of a pair defending the same site for 20 years. A single nesting attempt is made per breeding season, which is timed over the summer months. The nests of oystercatchers are simple affairs, scrapes in the ground which may be lined, and placed in a spot with good visibility. 

The eggs of oystercatchers are spotted and cryptic. Between one and four eggs are laid, with three being typical in the Northern Hemisphere and two in the south. Incubation is shared but not proportionally, females tend to take more incubation and males engage in more territory defence. Incubation varies by species, lasting between 24–39 days. Oystercatchers are also known to practice &quot;egg dumping.&quot; Like the cuckoo, they sometimes lay their eggs in the nests of other species such as seagulls, abandoning them to be raised by those birds.

==Conservation==
The Canary Islands oystercatcher became extinct during the 20th century. The Chatham oystercatcher is endemic to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand and is listed as endangered by the IUCN, while both the African and Eurasian oystercatchers are considered near threatened. There has been conflict with commercial shellfish farmers, but studies have found that the impact of oystercatchers is much smaller than that of shore crabs.

==Species==
The genus contains twelve species. Species in taxonomic order:










Several fossil species are known, including &quot;Haematopus sulcatus&quot; (Brodkorb, 1955) from the Barstovian of Florida and Zanclean of North Carolina, and which is evidently considered a synonym of the extant species &quot;Haematopus palliatus&quot;.

<text>Mick is a masculine given name or nickname, usually a hypocorism of Michael. Because of its popularity in Ireland, it is often used in the English-speaking world as an ethnic slur for Irish people. In Australia, the meaning also broadened to include all Catholics. A colloquial but possibly false etymology also attributes the origin of the slur to the prevalence of Irish surnames containing the patronymic prefix &quot;Mc-&quot; (or &quot;Mhic&quot;); whether this patronym significantly contributed to the development of the slur is debated, but the prevalence of the first name or nickname &quot;Mick&quot; among Irish people is considered by etymologists to be its primary origin.

<text>Taig, and (primarily formerly) also Teague, are anglicisations of the Irish-language male given name &quot;Tadhg&quot;, used as ethnic slurs for a stage Irishman. &quot;Taig&quot; in Northern Ireland and the west of Scotland is most commonly used as a derogatory term by loyalists to refer to Irish Catholics.

&quot;Tadhg&quot; was once so common as an Irish name that it became synonymous with the typical person, with phrases like [[Taig|&#x27; (&quot;Tadhg of the market&quot;) akin to &quot;[[the man on the Clapham omnibus]]&quot; or &quot;[[average Joe]]&quot;. In the late 1680s, the [[satire|satirical]] [[Williamite]] ballad &quot;[[Lillibullero]]&quot; includes the line: &quot;Ho brother Taig hast thou heard the decree?&quot; Conversely, the Irish-language name is used defiantly in a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] poem written in the 1690s: &quot;&quot;Who goes there&quot; does not provoke fear / &quot;I am Tadhg&quot; is the answer given&quot;. In 1698, [[John Dunton]] wrote a mocking account of Ireland, titled &quot;Teague Land – or A Ramble with the Wild Irish&quot;.
Although the term has rarely been used in [[North America]], a notable example of such use was when future [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] and lawyer [[John Adams]] successfully defended the soldiers responsible for the 1770 [[Boston Massacre]] by pleading to the jury that they were being attacked by:
... most probably a [[motley]] rabble of saucy boys, [[negro]]s and [[mulatto|molattoes]], Irish Teagues and outlandish [[Jack Tar|jack tarrs]]. —And why we should scruple to call such a set of people a mob, I can&#x27;t conceive, unless the name is too respectable for them?

In the context of [[segregation in Northern Ireland]] and [[sectarianism in Glasgow]], the term &quot;Taig&quot; is used as a derogatory term for a [[Roman Catholic]], used by [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestants]] and [[Ulster loyalism|Ulster loyalists]]. In this sense, it is used in a similar way to the word [[Fenian]], but is more ethnic in terms of abuse against people of Gaelic descent than &quot;Fenian&quot;, which more commonly signifies [[Irish republican]]. Extremist loyalists have also used slogans such as &quot;Kill All Taigs&quot; (KAT) and &quot;All Taigs Are Targets&quot; in graffiti.

In Scotland, &quot;Tim&quot; is sometimes used as an alternative to &quot;Taig&quot; (&quot;Tadhg&quot; is usually translated as &quot;Timothy&quot; and shortened to &quot;Tim&quot; in English).

<text>Confederate Memorial Day (called Confederate Heroes Day in Texas and Florida, and Confederate Decoration Day in Tennessee) is a holiday observed in several Southern U.S. states on various dates since the end of the American Civil War. The holiday was originally publicly presented as a day to remember the estimated 258,000 Confederate soldiers who died during the American Civil War.

The holiday originated at a local level by Ladies&#x27; Memorial Associations to care for the graves of Confederate dead. In 1866, General John A. Logan commanded the posts of Grand Army of the Republic to strew flowers on the graves of Union soldiers, which observance later became the national Memorial Day. In a speech to veterans in Salem, Illinois, on July 4, 1866, Logan referred to the various dates of observance adopted in the South for the practice, saying &quot;…traitors in the South have their gatherings day after day, to strew garlands of flowers upon the graves of Rebel soldiers...&quot;

The Southern Poverty Law Center has condemned the holiday as part of a campaign of &quot;racial terror&quot; on the part of white supremacists - &quot;an organized propaganda campaign, created to instill fear and ensure the ongoing oppression of formerly enslaved people.&quot; Writers and historians have pointed out that the holiday&#x27;s official recognition by states often coincided with the height of Jim Crow racism around the United States, decades after the war ended. Renewed interest also revived the holiday in some places during the beginning of the civil rights movement in the 1950s.

It is currently an official state holiday in Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas (where state employees are entitled to a paid day off work), while it is commemorated in Kentucky, Florida, North Carolina, and Tennessee. It was also formerly recognized in Missouri, Louisiana, and Virginia. In Georgia, a state holiday is still observed on the 4th Monday in April however, since 2016, it is referred to simply as a &quot;State Holiday&quot;. Several states celebrate the date on or near April 26, when the last major Confederate field army surrendered at Bennett Place, North Carolina in 1865.

==Origins==

In the spring of 1866 the Ladies Memorial Association of Columbus, Georgia, passed a resolution to set aside one day annually to memorialize the Confederate war dead. Mary Ann Williams, the association secretary, was directed to pen a letter inviting ladies associations in every former Confederate state to join them in the observance. Their invitation was written in March 1866 and sent to all of the principal cities in the former Confederacy, including Atlanta; Macon; Montgomery; Memphis; Richmond; St. Louis; Alexandria; Columbia; and New Orleans, as well as smaller towns like Staunton, Virginia; Anderson, South Carolina; and Wilmington, North Carolina. The actual date for the holiday was selected by Elizabeth Rutherford Ellis. She chose April 26, the first anniversary of Confederate General Johnston&#x27;s surrender to Union Major General Sherman at Bennett Place. For many in the Confederacy, that date in 1865 marked the end of the Civil War.

The first official celebration as a public holiday occurred in 1874, following a proclamation by the Georgia legislature. By 1916, ten states celebrated it, on June 3, the birthday of CSA President Jefferson Davis. Other states chose late April dates, or May 10, commemorating Davis&#x27; capture.

Historians have pointed out that the holiday&#x27;s official recognition by states often coincided with the height of Jim Crow racism around the United States. In some places, the holiday attracted revived interest as a reaction to the early civil rights movement in the 1950s.

==Connection to Memorial Day==
In their book, &quot;The Genesis of the Memorial Day Holiday in America&quot;, Bellware and Gardiner assert that the national Memorial Day holiday is a direct offshoot of the observance begun by the Ladies Memorial Association of Columbus, Georgia in 1866. In a few places, most notably Columbus, Mississippi and Macon, Georgia, both Confederate and Union graves were decorated during the first observance. The day was even referred to as Memorial Day by &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; on May 8, 1866, after the ladies organization that started it. The name Confederate Memorial Day was not used until the Northern observance was initiated in 1868.

While initially cool to the idea of a Northern version of the holiday, General John A. Logan was eventually won over. His General Order No. 11, issued May 5, 1868, commanded the posts of Grand Army of the Republic to strew flowers on the graves of Union soldiers. The Grand Army of the Republic eventually adopted the name Memorial Day at their national encampment in 1882.

Many theories have been offered as to how Logan became aware of the former Confederate tradition he imitated in 1868. In her autobiography, his wife Mary Logan claims she told him about it after a trip to Virginia in the spring of that year. His secretary and his adjutant also claim they told him about it. John Murray of Waterloo, New York, claims it was he who inspired Logan in 1868. Bellware and Gardiner, however, offer proof that Logan was aware of the Southern tributes long before any of them had a chance to mention it to him. In a speech to veterans in Salem, Illinois, on July 4, 1866, Logan referred to the various dates of observance adopted in the South for the practice saying &quot;…traitors in the South have their gatherings day after day, to strew garlands of flowers upon the graves of Rebel soldiers...&quot;

==Statutory holidays==
Confederate Memorial Day is a statutory holiday in Alabama on the fourth Monday in April, in Mississippi on the final Monday in April, and in South Carolina on May 10. In all of these states, state offices are closed on this day (in Texas a so-called &quot;skeleton crew&quot; is required however staff are later compensated for their work on the holiday.

In Georgia, the fourth Monday in April was formerly celebrated as Confederate Memorial Day, but beginning in 2016, in response to the Charleston church shooting, the names of Confederate Memorial Day and Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Birthday were struck from the state calendar and the statutory holidays were designated simply as &quot;state holidays&quot;. Florida also continues to officially designate Confederate Memorial Day on the fourth Monday in April, although state offices remain open.

North Carolina also designates the holiday on May 10, although state offices remain open and localities may choose whether to observe it.

In June 2022, the Louisiana State Legislature voted to remove Confederate Memorial Day, as well as Robert E. Lee Day, from the state&#x27;s calendar of official holidays.

===Related holidays===
====Tennessee====
In Tennessee, the governor is required by law to proclaim Confederate Decoration Day each June 3.

====Texas====

In Texas, state offices remain open on this day but employees may have an optional, paid day off with state offices working a skeleton crew.

In 1931, the Texas Legislature made Robert E. Lee&#x27;s birthday (January 19) a state holiday. 

In 1973, the Texas House had massive turnover, with 71 incoming freshman and 8 new Black representatives, which was the most in the House since the Reconstruction era. One of the new Black legislators, Senfronia Thompson, filed a bill to make January 15 a state holiday for Martin Luther King Jr., as an &quot;honorary&quot; state holiday that would not have any state offices or banks close in observance. The bill did not get a vote, but they did make other changes to the state holidays: the Texas Legislature removed Jefferson Davis&#x27;s and Robert E. Lee&#x27;s birthdays as state holidays, and replaced them with Confederate Heroes Day, to be celebrated on January 19. 

In 1987, Martin Luther King Jr. Day was added as a federal holiday for the third Monday in January, and in that year the Texas Legislature made it an optional state holiday, and in 1991 they made MLK Day an official state holiday. In some years (1987, 1998, 2004, 2009, 2015, 2026) MLK Jr. Day and Confederate Heroes Day fall on the same day. 

Texas state Representatives and Senators have tried to amend or abolish Confederate Heroes Day from the state calendar:

* 2015: State Representative Donna Howard filed a bill to rename the holiday Civil War Remembrance Day; it did not get out of the committee for a vote

* 2019: State Representative Jarvis Johnson filed a bill to end the state holiday. It did not get out of committee. 

* 2021: State Representatives Jarvis Johnson and Shawn Thierry filed bills to abolish the holiday, and state Senator Nathan M. Johnson filed a bill to replace the holiday with one in June celebrating suffrage for all Americans; these did not get out of committee.

* 2023: State Representative Jarvis Johnson again filed a bill to remove the holiday and state Senator Nathan Johnson sponsored legislation in the Senate; they did not get out of committee.

==Controversy==

The holiday has been condemned by the Southern Poverty Law Center as part of a campaign of &quot;racial terror&quot; on the part of white supremacists, &quot;an organized propaganda campaign, created to instill fear and ensure the ongoing oppression of formerly enslaved people&quot;. Critics often cite the fact that the Confederacy was formed for the purpose of protecting slavery. Some commemorations have been met with groups of protesters.

Various proposals have been made in the legislatures of the states still recognizing it to remove it from the list of state holidays or commemorations, or to replace it with Juneteenth.

The campaign for de-recognition of the holiday overlaps with that for removal of Confederate monuments and memorials, and is often highlighted after incidents of racial violence, such as the Charleston church shooting, the 2017 Charlottesville car attack, and the 2020 murder of George Floyd.

<text>In music, a bow () is a tensioned stick which has hair (usually horse-tail hair) coated in rosin (to facilitate friction) affixed to it. It is moved across some part (generally some type of strings) of a musical instrument to cause vibration, which the instrument emits as sound. The vast majority of bows are used with string instruments, such as the violin, viola, cello, and bass, although some bows are used with musical saws and other bowed idiophones.

==Materials and manufacture==
A bow consists of a specially shaped stick with other material forming a ribbon stretched between its ends, which is used to stroke the string and create sound. Different musical cultures have adopted various designs for the bow. For instance, in some bows a single cord is stretched between the ends of the stick. In the Western tradition of bow making—bows for the instruments of the violin and viol families—a hank of horsehair is normally employed.

The manufacture of bows is considered a demanding craft, and well-made bows command high prices. Part of the bow maker&#x27;s skill is the ability to choose high quality material for the stick. Historically, Western bows have been made of pernambuco wood from Brazil. However, pernambuco is now an endangered species whose export is regulated by international treaty, so makers are currently adopting other materials: woods such as Ipê (Tabebuia) and synthetic materials, such as carbon fiber epoxy composite and fiberglass.

For the frog, which holds and adjusts the near end of the horsehair, ebony is most often used, but other materials, often decorative, were used as well, such as ivory and tortoiseshell. Materials such as mother of pearl or abalone shell are often used on the slide that covers the mortise, as well as in round decorative &quot;eyes&quot; inlaid on the side surfaces. Sometimes &quot;Parisian eyes&quot; are used, with the circle of shell surrounded by a metal ring. The metal parts of the frog, or mountings, may be used by the maker to mark various grades of bow, ordinary bows being mounted with nickel silver, better bows with silver, and the finest being gold-mounted. (Not all makers adhere uniformly to this practice.) Near the frog is the &quot;grip&quot;, which is made of a wire, silk, or &quot;whalebone&quot; wrap and a thumb cushion made of leather or snakeskin. The tip plate of the bow may be made of bone, ivory, mammoth ivory, or metal, such as silver.

A bow maker or &quot;&quot; typically uses between 150 and 200 hairs from the tail of a horse for a violin bow. Bows for other members of the violin family typically have a wider ribbon, using more hairs. There is a widely held belief among string players, neither proven nor disproven scientifically, that white hair produces a &quot;smoother&quot; sound and black hair (used mainly for double bass bows) is coarser and thus produces a &quot;rougher&quot; sound. Lower quality (inexpensive) bows often use nylon or synthetic hair, and some use bleached horse hair to give the appearance of higher quality. Rosin, or , a hard, sticky substance made from resin (sometimes mixed with wax), is regularly applied to the bow hair to increase friction.

In making a wooden bow, the greater part of the woodworking is done on a straight stick. According to James McKean, &quot;the bow maker graduates the stick in precise gradations so that it is evenly flexible throughout&quot;. These gradations were originally calculated by François Tourte, discussed below. To shape the curve or &quot;camber&quot; of the bow stick, the maker carefully heats the stick in an alcohol flame, a few inches at a time, bending the heated stick gradually—using a metal or wooden template to get the model&#x27;s exact curve and shape.

The art of making wooden bows has changed little since the 19th century. Most modern composite sticks roughly resemble the Tourte design. Various inventors have explored new ways of bow-making. The Incredibow, for example, has a straight stick cambered only by the fixed tension of the synthetic hair.

==Types==
Slightly different bows, varying in weight and length, are used for the violin, viola, cello, and double bass.

These are generally variations on the same basic design. However, bassists use two distinct forms of the double bass bow. The &quot;French&quot; overhand bow is constructed like the bow used with other bowed orchestral instruments, and the bassist holds the stick from opposite the frog. The &quot;German&quot; underhand bow is broader and longer than the French bow, with a larger frog curved to fit the palm of the hand. The bassist holds the German stick with the hand loosely encompassing the frog. The German bow is the older of the two designs, having superseded the earlier arched bow. The French bow became popular with its adoption in the 19th century by virtuoso Giovanni Bottesini. Both are found in the orchestra, though typically an individual bass player prefers to perform using one or the other type of bow.

==Bowing==

The characteristic long, sustained, and singing sound produced by the violin, viola, violoncello, and double bass is due to the drawing of the bow against their strings. This sustaining of musical sound with a bow is comparable to a singer using breath to sustain sounds and sing long, smooth, or &quot;legato&quot; melodies.

The term used for playing with a bow is &quot;arco&quot;, from the Latin word &quot;arcus&quot;, meaning bow. Therefore, to play arco is to play with a bow.

In modern practice, the bow is almost always held in the right hand while the left is used for fingering. When the player pulls the bow across the strings (such that the frog moves away from the instrument), it is called a &quot;down-bow&quot;; pushing the bow so the frog moves toward the instrument is an &quot;up-bow&quot; (the directions &quot;down&quot; and &quot;up&quot; are literally descriptive for violins and violas and are employed in analogous fashion
for the cello and double bass). Two consecutive notes played in the same bow direction are referred to as a hooked bow; a down-bow following a whole down-bow is called a retake.

Generally, the player uses down-bow for strong musical beats and up-bow for weak beats. However, this is reversed in the viola da gamba—players of violin family instruments look like they are &quot;pulling&quot; on the strong beats, where gamba players look like they are &quot;stabbing&quot; on the strong beats. The difference may result from the different ways player hold the bow in these instrument families: violin/viola/cello players hold the wood part of the bow closer to the palm, whereas gamba players use the opposite orientation, with the horsehair closer. The orientation appropriate to each instrument family permits the stronger wrist muscles (flexors) to reinforce the strong beat.

String players control their tone quality by touching the bow to the strings at varying distances from the bridge, emphasizing the higher harmonics by playing sul ponticello (&quot;on the bridge&quot;), or reducing them, and so emphasizing the fundamental frequency, by playing sul tasto (&quot;on the fingerboard&quot;).

Occasionally, composers ask the player to use the bow by touching the strings with the wood rather than the hair; this is known by the Italian phrase &quot;col legno&quot; (&quot;with the wood&quot;). &quot;Coll&#x27;arco&quot; (&quot;with the bow&quot;) is the indication to use the bow hair to create the sound in the normal way.

==History==

===Origin===

The question of when and where the bow was invented is of interest because the technique of using it to produce sound on a stringed instrument has led to many important historical and regional developments in music, as well as the variety of instruments used.

Pictorial and sculptural evidence from early Egyptian, Indian, Hellenic, and Anatolian civilizations indicate that plucked stringed instruments existed long before the technique of bowing developed. In spite of the ancient origins of the bow and arrow, it would appear that bowed string instruments only developed during a comparatively recent period.

The Chinese &quot;yazheng&quot; is a zither played with a bow. The earliest Chinese source of the pipe zither &quot;yazheng&quot;, bowed with a stick, is from the 8th century. The use of rubbing sticks in Central Asia seems to be older. Presumably this playing technique was first used in lutes in Sogdiana around the 6th century, from where it reached China.

Eric Halfpenny, writing in the 1988 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, says, &quot;bowing can be traced as far back as the Islamic civilization of the 10th century ... it seems likely that the principle of bowing originated among the nomadic horse riding cultures of Central Asia, whence it spread quickly through Islam and the East, so that by 1000 it had almost simultaneously reached China, Java, North Africa, the Near East and Balkans, and Europe.&quot; Halfpenny notes that in many Eurasian languages the word for &quot;bridge&quot; etymologically means &quot;horse,&quot; and that the Chinese regarded their own bowed instruments &quot;(huqin)&quot; as having originated with the &quot;barbarians&quot; of Central Asia.

The Central Asian theory is endorsed by Werner Bachmann, writing in &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;. Bachmann notes evidence from a 10th-century Central Asian wall painting for bowed instruments in what is now the city of Kurbanshaid in Tajikistan.

Circumstantial evidence also supports the Central Asian theory. All the elements that were necessary for the invention of the bow were probably present among the Central Asian horse riding peoples at the same time:

*In a society of horse-mounted warriors (the horse peoples included the Huns and the Mongols), horsehair obviously would have been available.
*Central Asian horse warriors specialized in the military bow, which could easily have served the inventor as a temporary way to hold horsehair at high tension.
*To this day, horsehair for bows is taken from places with harsh cold climates, including Mongolia, as such hair offers a better grip on the strings.
*Rosin, crucial for creating sound even with coarse horsehair, is used by traditional archers to maintain the integrity of the string and (mixed with beeswax) to protect the finish of the bow.

(From this information it can be seen that the invention of the bow originates from a Mongol warrior, having just used rosin on his equipment, idly stroking his harp or lyre with a rosin-dusted finger, producing a brief continuous sound, thus inspiring them to restring their bow with horsehair, leading to the earliest example of the bow)

However the bow was invented, it spread quickly and widely. The Central Asian horse peoples occupied a territory that included the Silk Road, along which merchants and travelers transported goods and innovations rapidly for thousands of miles (including, via India, by sea to Java). This would account for the near-simultaneous appearance of the musical bow in the many locations cited by Halfpenny.

===Arabic &quot;rabāb&quot;===
The Arabic rabāb is a type of a bowed string instrument so named no later than the 8th century and spread via Islamic trading routes over much of North Africa, the Middle East, parts of Europe, and the Far East. It is the earliest known bowed instrument, and the ancestor of all European bowed instruments, including the rebec, lyra and violin.

===Modern Western bow===
The kind of bow in use today was brought into its modern form largely by the bow maker François Tourte in 19th-century France. Pernambuco wood, which was imported into France to make textile dye, was found by the early French bow masters to have just the right combination of strength, resiliency, weight, and beauty. According to James McKean, Tourte&#x27;s bows, &quot;like the instruments of Stradivari, are still considered to be without equal.&quot;

===Historical bows===
The early 18th-century bow referred to as the Corelli-Tartini model is also referred to as the Italian &#x27;sonata&#x27; bow. This basic Baroque bow supplanted by 1725 an earlier French dance bow that was short with a little point. The French dance bow was held with the thumb under the hair and played with short, quick strokes for rhythmic dance music. The Italian sonata bow was longer, from 24 to 28 inches (61–71 cm.), with a straight or slightly convex stick. The head is described as a pike&#x27;s head, and the frog is either fixed (the clip-in bow) or has a screw mechanism. The screw is an early improvement, indicative of further changes to come. As compared to a modern Tourte-style bow, the Corelli-Tartini model is shorter and lighter, especially at the tip, the balance point is lower down on the stick, the hair more yielding, and the ribbon of hair narrower—about 6 mm wide.

In the early bow (the Baroque bow), the natural bow stroke is a non-legato norm, producing what Leopold Mozart called a &quot;small softness&quot; at the beginning and end of each stroke.

A lighter, clearer sound is produced, and quick notes are cleanly articulated without the hair leaving the string.

A truly great example of such a bow, described by David Boyden, is part of the Ansley Salz Collection at the University of California at Berkeley. It was made around 1700, and is attributed to Stradivari.

Towards the middle of the century (18th century), there was a move into the Transitional period, the separation of hair from stick became greater, particularly at the head. This greater separation is necessary because the stick becomes longer and straighter, approaching a concave shape.

Up until the advent of the bow by Tourte, there was absolutely no standardization of bow features during this Transitional period, and every bow was different in weight, length and balance.
In particular, the heads varied enormously by any given maker.

Another transitional type of bow may be called the Cramer bow, after the violinist Wilhelm Cramer (1746–99) who lived the early part of his life in Mannheim (Germany) and, after 1772, in London. This bow and models comparable to it in Paris, generally prevailed between the gradual demise of the Corelli-Tartini model and the birth of the Tourte—that is, roughly 1750 until 1785.
In the view of top experts, the Cramer bow represents a decisive step towards the modern bow.

The Cramer bow and others like it were gradually rendered obsolete by the advent of François Tourte&#x27;s standardized bow. The hair (on the Cramer bow) is wider than the Corelli model but still narrower than a Tourte, the screw mechanism becomes standard, and more sticks are made from pernambuco, rather than the earlier snakewood, ironwood, and china wood, which were often fluted for a portion of the length of the stick.

Fine makers of these Transitional models were Duchaîne, La Fleur, Meauchand, Tourte &quot;père&quot;, and Edward Dodd.

The underlying reasons for the change from the old Corelli-Tartini model to the Cramer and, finally, to the Tourte were naturally related to musical demands on the part of composers and violinists.
Undoubtedly the emphasis on cantabile, especially the long drawn out and evenly sustained phrase, required a generally longer bow and also a somewhat wider ribbon of hair. These new bows were ideal to fill the new, very large concert halls with sound and worked great with the late classical and the new romantic repertoire.

Today, with the rise of the historically informed performance movement, string players have developed a revived interest in the lighter, pre-Tourte bow, as more suitable for playing stringed instruments made in pre-19th-century style.

===Stradivarius bows===
A Stradivari bow, The King Charles IV Violin Bow attributed to the Stradivari Workshop, is currently in the collection of the National Music Museum Object number: 04882, at the University of South Dakota in Vermillion, South Dakota. The Rawlins Gallery violin bow, NMM 4882, is attributed to the workshop of Antonio Stradivari, Cremona, 1700.
This bow is one of two bows (the other in a private collection) attributed to the workshop of Antonio Stradivari.

===Other types of bow===
The Chinese yazheng, &quot;yaqin&quot;, Korean ajaeng and Ryukyu teisō (nihongo: 提箏, hiragana: ていそう) zither are generally played by &quot;bowing&quot; with a rosined stick, which creates friction against the strings without any horsehair. The hurdy-gurdy&#x27;s strings are similarly set into vibration by means of a &quot;rosin wheel,&quot; a wooden wheel that contacts the strings as it is rotated by means of a crank handle, creating a &quot;bowed&quot; tone.

===The modern Curved Bow===
In the 20th century, violinists and cellists used a so-called Curved Bow to enable polyphonic sounds on string instruments. Renowned string instrumentalists such as Emil Telmányi, Rudolf Gaehler, Tossy Spivakovsky, Lorin Maazel, Michael Bach, Gustav Rivinius, Janos Starker and Mstislav Rostropovich, as well as composers such as John Cage, Dieter Schnebel, Walter Zimmermann, Hans Zender and Michael Bach Bachtischa have dealt with this innovation in string instrument playing.

==Maintenance==
Careful owners always loosen the hair on a bow before putting it away. James McKean recommends that the owner &quot;loosen the hair completely, then bring it back just a single turn of the button.&quot; The goal is to &quot;keep the hair even but allow the bow to relax.&quot; Over-tightening the bow, however, can also be damaging to the stick and cause it to break.

Since hairs may break in service, bows must be periodically rehaired, an operation usually performed by professional bow makers rather than by the instrument owner.

Bows sometimes lose their correct camber (see above), and are recambered using the same heating method as is used in the original manufacture.

Lastly, the grip or winding of the bow must occasionally be replaced to maintain a good grip and protect the wood.

These repairs are usually left to professionals, as the head of the bow is extremely fragile, and a poor rehair, or a broken ivory plate on the tip, can lead to ruining the bow.

==Nomenclature==
In vernacular speech, the bow is occasionally called a &quot;fiddlestick&quot;. Bows for particular instruments are often designated as such: &quot;violin bow&quot;, &quot;cello bow&quot;, and so on.

== As used on percussion ==

Recently, bass and cello bows have been used on certain percussion instruments as an extended technique. This technique is most commonly used on instruments made of metal, particularly, vibraphone, crotales, and cymbals. As these instruments are usually struck with a stick or mallet, utilizing a bow can bring out timbres that would otherwise be unachievable if using standard technique.

<doc id="220221" wikidata="Q1741508" url="?curid=220221" title="Roger McGough">
<text>Roger Joseph McGough (; born 9 November 1937) is an English poet, performance poet, broadcaster, children&#x27;s author and playwright. He presents the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Poetry Please&quot;, as well as performing his own poetry. McGough was one of the leading members of the Liverpool poets, a group of young poets influenced by Beat poetry and the popular music and culture of 1960s Liverpool. He is an honorary fellow of Liverpool John Moores University, a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and President of the Poetry Society.

==Early life==
McGough was born in Litherland, Lancashire, on the outskirts of Liverpool, to Roger Francis, a docker, and Mary (McGarry) McGough. His ancestry is Irish and he was raised in the Roman Catholic faith. He was a pupil at St Mary&#x27;s College in Crosby, before going on to study French and Geography at the University of Hull. McGough lived in one of the university residences, Needler Hall, for three years from 1955 and served as hall librarian. Contemporaneously, the poet Philip Larkin became the university&#x27;s librarian; newly arrived at Hull, he served as a sub-warden at Needler Hall, though he lived in private accommodation nearby. Several years later McGough corresponded with Larkin about poetry, sending him some of his own poems as he still lacked the confidence to approach the man directly. Larkin replied, thanking McGough for the poetry, which he had enjoyed reading. He added that he believed that McGough walked an impressionistic tightrope which, though exhilarating, meant that on occasion he fell off.

==The Scaffold and GRIMMS==
Returning to Merseyside in the early 1960s, McGough worked as a French teacher and, with John Gorman, organised arts events. McGough and Gorman later met Mike McGear (Mike McCartney) and together formed the trio The Scaffold; they worked the Edinburgh Festival Fringe until they were signed to Parlophone records in 1966. The Scaffold performed a mixture of comic songs, comedy sketches and the poetry of McGough. The group scored several hit records, reaching number one in the UK Singles Chart in 1968 with their version of &quot;Lily the Pink&quot;. McGough wrote the lyrics for many of the group&#x27;s songs and also recorded the musical comedy/poetry album &quot;McGough and McGear&quot;.

In 1971 GRIMMS was formed, originally as a merger of the Scaffold, the Bonzo Dog Band and the Liverpool Scene. Group member Neil Innes said about the formation of the group: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what attracted the Scaffold to the Bonzos; we were incredibly anarchic, which was probably something shared by the Scaffold as well.&quot;

==Poetry==
As a poet, McGough came to national prominence through the publication of &quot;The Mersey Sound&quot; in 1967. &quot;The Mersey Sound&quot; is an anthology of poetry by three Liverpool poets: McGough, Brian Patten, and Adrian Henri. It went on to sell over 500,000 copies, becoming one of the bestselling poetry anthologies of all time; remaining in continuous publication, it was revised in 1983 and again in 2007. The title of the anthology was a conscious association of the three Liverpool poets with the musical phenomenon caused by the eruption of the Beatles and associated bands from the same city, known collectively as the &quot;Merseybeat&quot;, on the world. McGough&#x27;s personal connection with the Beatles was referenced in a much later comic poem, &quot;To Macca&#x27;s Trousers&quot;, contained in the book &quot;That Awkward Age&quot; (2009). McGough discovered a long forgotten pair of Paul McCartney&#x27;s blue mohair trousers in his attic; the trousers had been given to him, via McCartney&#x27;s brother Mike, in the early 1960s.

One of McGough&#x27;s early poems, &quot;Let Me Die a Youngman&#x27;s Death&quot; (but not, as the poem states, before the poet reaches 73, 91 or 104 years of age), was included in a BBC anthology of the British nation&#x27;s hundred favourite poems. McGough has been nicknamed &quot;the patron saint of poetry&quot; by Carol Ann Duffy.

Philip Larkin included McGough&#x27;s poetry in &quot;The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse&quot;, which he edited in 1973. Writing to McGough in 1980, Larkin congratulated him on the well-thumbed state of the copies of his books in Hull University&#x27;s library, when compared to Larkin&#x27;s own.

Possibly his shortest, most memorable and overtly political poem, was entitled &quot;Conservative Government Unemployment Figures&quot;. The text of poem repeats the words of the title, with layout and punctuation resulting in an arch critique. The poem was referenced in a parliamentary debate in the House of Commons in 2004.

The poetry of McGough has been the subject of academic study. It has been characterised, at least from its early examples, as being reliant on play with words and their meanings. It has also been noted to exhibit a stylised wit, and, at times, a sadness based on themes of lost youth, unfulfilled relationships, and the downside of city life. The form of some of his verse, it has been claimed, has been influenced by his experience of writing song lyrics. A major critical examination of McGough&#x27;s poetry, by American academic Ben Wright, was published in 2006. The author&#x27;s stated aim was &quot;to examine and evaluate the accessibility of Roger McGough&#x27;s message to a wide, general readership, as well as appraising it by the most rigorous literary standards&quot;. McGough&#x27;s popularity, commercial success, use of humour, and the lack of pretension of his verse has tended to restrict appreciation of his work as &quot;serious poetry&quot;. Wright&#x27;s study challenges this under-appreciation.

==Other activities==

McGough was responsible for much of the humorous dialogue in the Beatles&#x27; animated film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, although he did not receive an on-screen credit.

On 2 March 1978, McGough appeared in &quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot;, a mockumentary detailing the career of a Beatles-like group called the Rutles. Interviewed by Eric Idle, the introduction of McGough takes so long that he is only asked one question, &quot;Did you know the Rutles?&quot; to which McGough cheerfully responds &quot;Oh yes&quot;, before the documentary is forced to move along to other events. In 1980 he recited a high-speed one-minute version of Longfellow&#x27;s poem &quot;The Wreck of the Hesperus&quot;, complete with sound effects, on the album &quot;Miniatures&quot; produced by Morgan Fisher.

One of McGough&#x27;s more unusual compositions was created in 1981, when he co-wrote an &quot;electronic poem&quot; called &quot;Now Press Return&quot; with the programmer Richard Warner for inclusion with the &quot;Welcome Tape&quot; of the BBC Micro home computer. &quot;Now Press Return&quot; incorporated several novel themes, including user-defined elements to the poem, lines which changed their order (and meaning) every few seconds, and text which wrote itself in a spiral around the screen. He contributed poetry to and narrated a programme in 1991 for Channel 4 called &quot;Equinox: The Elements&quot; about the elements. He made a guest appearance on quiz panel show &quot;QI&quot; in 2006.

Three plays written by the 17th-century French playwright Molière have been translated by McGough and directed by Gemma Bodinetz. &quot;Tartuffe&quot; premièred at the Liverpool Playhouse in May 2008 and transferred subsequently to the Rose Theatre, Kingston. &quot;The Hypochondriac&quot; (&quot;The Imaginary Invalid&quot;) was staged at the Liverpool Playhouse in July 2009. &quot;The Misanthrope&quot; was staged at the Liverpool Playhouse in February–March 2013 before touring with the English Touring Theatre.

McGough has also done some voiceover work narrating &quot;The Very Hungry Caterpillar and Other Stories&quot; by Eric Carle, and TV advertisements for the supermarket chain Waitrose.

He is a patron of Barnes Literary Society. In 2019 he became the President of Arts Richmond for one year.

==Awards==
McGough won a Cholmondeley Award in 1998, and was appointed an Officer (OBE) in 1997, and later, in 2004, Commander (CBE) of the Order of the British Empire. 

He holds an honorary MA from Nene College of Further Education, and honorary Doctor of Letters (D.Litt.) degrees from the University of Hull (2004), Roehampton University (2006), and the University of Liverpool (2006). He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2004.

==Academic posts==
McGough was Fellow of Poetry at Loughborough University (1973–75), Honorary Fellow at John Moores University, and Honorary Professor at Thames Valley University (1993).

==Personal life==
In 1970, McGough married Thelma Monaghan, and they had two children; they divorced in 1980. He married Hilary Clough in December 1986, with whom he has two children. He lives in Barnes, south west London; he and Clough previously lived on Portobello Road in Notting Hill Gate.

<text>The Rwenzori (also known as the Ruwenzori, Rwenzururu or Rwenjura) are a range of mountains in eastern equatorial Africa, located on the border between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The highest peak of the Ruwenzori reaches , and the range&#x27;s upper regions are permanently snow-capped and glaciated. Rivers fed by mountain streams form one of the sources of the Nile. Because of this, European explorers linked the Ruwenzori with the legendary Mountains of the Moon, claimed by the Greek scholar Ptolemy as the source of the Nile. Virunga National Park in eastern DR Congo and Rwenzori Mountains National Park in southwestern Uganda are located within the range.

==Geology==


The mountains formed about three million years ago in the late Pliocene epoch and are the result of an uplifted block of crystalline rocks including gneiss, amphibolite, granite and quartzite.

The Rwenzori mountains are the highest non-volcanic, non-orogenic mountains in the world.

This uplift divided the paleolake Obweruka and created three of the present-day African Great Lakes: Lake Albert, Lake Edward, and Lake George.

The range is about long and wide. It consists of six massifs separated by deep gorges: Mount Stanley (), Mount Speke (), Mount Baker (), Mount Emin (), Mount Gessi () and Mount Luigi di Savoia (). Mount Stanley has several subsidiary summits, with Margherita Peak being the highest point.
== Human history ==
The mountains are occasionally identified with the legendary &quot;Mountains of the Moon&quot;, described in antiquity as the source of the Nile River. Modern European explorers observed the range beginning in the late nineteenth century, with Samuel Baker reporting what he called the &quot;Blue Mountains&quot; looming in the distance in 1864, and Henry M. Stanley visiting the range in 1875 and 1888, when he recorded the name as &quot;Ruwenzori&quot;.

In 1906, the Duke of Abruzzi mounted an expedition to the Ruwenzori, the account of which was subsequently published by Filippo De Filippi. The expedition scaled the highest peaks of the range, several of which were named by the duke, while Mount Luigi di Savoia was named in his honour. Accompanying the duke was photographer Vittorio Sella, who had previously visited the mountains. His photographs of the glaciers and moraines of the Ruwenzori demonstrated that the glaciers were already in retreat. Sella&#x27;s photographic work is conserved at the Museo Nazionale della Montagna in Turin and at the Istituto di Fotografia Alpina Vittorio Sella in Biella, both in Italy. The Makerere University, Uganda, also has a selection of his images.

The first traverse of the six massifs of the Ruwenzori was done in 1975, starting on 27 January and ending on 13 February. The traverse was done by Polish climbers Janusz Chalecki, Stanisław Cholewa and Leszek S. Czarnecki, with Mirosław Kuraś accompanying them on the last half of the traverse.

Since Uganda&#x27;s independence from the British Empire, the Rwenzori Mountains have repeatedly become sanctuaries to rebel groups. The secessionist Rwenzururu movement fought an insurgency in the mountains in the 1960s. In course of the Ugandan Bush War, the Rwenzururu movement reemerged and continued its struggle until signing a peace deal with Ugandan President Milton Obote&#x27;s government. In the Bush War&#x27;s later stages, the National Resistance Army (NRA) rebel force operated in the mountains. After the NRA seized power in Uganda in 1986, another civil war broke out. This time, the Rwenzori Mountains hosted the bases of the National Army for the Liberation of Uganda (NALU) and the &quot;Partie de Liberation Congolaise&quot; (PLC), an anti-Mobutu rebel group. In the early 1990s, a Congolese rebel group known as the National Council of Resistance for Democracy (&quot;Conseil National de Résistance pour la Démocratie&quot;, CNRD) led by André Kisase Ngandu began to wage an insurgency against Mobutu from the Rwenzori Mountains.

Militias aligned with the old Rwenzururu movement&#x27;s ideology occupied the Rwenzori Mountains from 1997 to June 2001. In 2020, after being defeated across the border by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, some elements of the Allied Democratic Forces moved into the Rwenzori Mountains.

==Natural history==
===Flora===
The Ruwenzori are known for their vegetation, ranging from tropical rainforest through alpine meadows to snow. The range supports its own species and varieties of giant groundsel and giant lobelia and even has a tall heather covered in moss that lives on one of its peaks. Most of the range is now a World Heritage Site and is covered jointly by Rwenzori Mountains National Park in southwestern Uganda and the Virunga National Park in the eastern Congo.

There is no water shortage in the Ruwenzori; yet, several members of the afro-alpine family resemble species that normally thrive in desert climates. The reason lies in their similar water economy. Water is not always readily available to the afroalpine plants when they need it. In addition, nightly frosts affect the sap transport in the plants and the intake of water by its roots. As the day begins, the air temperature and radiation level rise rapidly, putting strenuous demands on the exposed parts of the plants as they try to meet the transpiration demands of the leaves and maintain a proper water balance. To counter the effects of freezing, the afro-alpine plants have developed the insulation systems that give them such a striking appearance. These adaptations become more prominent as the elevation increases.

There are five overlapping vegetation zones in the Ruwenzori: the evergreen forest zone (up to ); the bamboo zone (); the heather zone (); the alpine zone (); and, the nival zone (). At higher elevations, some plants reach an unusually large size, such as lobelia and groundsels. The vegetation in the Ruwenzori is unique to equatorial alpine Africa.


== Glacial recession ==


An ongoing concern is the impact of climate change on the Ruwenzori&#x27;s glaciers. In 1906, forty-three named glaciers were distributed over six mountains with a total area of , about half the total glacier area in Africa. By 2005, less than half of these were still present, on only three mountains, with an area of about . Recent scientific studies, such as those by Richard Taylor of University College London, have attributed this retreat to global climate change and have investigated the impact of this change on the mountain&#x27;s vegetation and biodiversity. In 2012, 2020 and 2022; Klaus Thymann led an expedition with the environmental charity Project Pressure creating comparative photographs to visually document the glacier recession, the findings were published in global media including BBC One Planet, The Guardian and Yale Environment 360.
The alteration can be seen in comparative images. As the temperature rises and the glaciers recede, vegetation slowly creeps up the mountain.

<doc id="220228" wikidata="Q1002590" url="?curid=220228" title="Cape crow">
<text>The Cape crow or black crow (Corvus capensis) is slightly larger (48–50 cm in length) than the carrion crow and is completely black with a slight gloss of purple in its feathers. It also has proportionately longer legs, wings, and tail, and has a much longer, slimmer bill that seems to be adapted for probing into the ground for invertebrates. The head feathers have a coppery-purple gloss and the throat feathers are quite long and fluffed out in some calls and displays.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species occurs in two large separate regions of the African continent. One form ranges from the Cape at the southern tip of Africa north to southern Angola and across to the east coast of Mozambique. The other population occurs in a large area from South Sudan, Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Kenya in central East Africa. The more northern population is on average slightly smaller than the southern. It inhabits open grassland, moorland, and agricultural areas with some trees or woodland in the vicinity for nesting. It seems to thrive especially in agricultural areas.

==Behaviour==

===Diet===
It eats grain and other seeds, and invertebrates, which it digs for with powerful downward stabs of its long bill. It opens maize kernels before they are fully ripe, bulbs and fleshy roots of certain plants, frogs and small reptiles, and fruits and berries. It takes the eggs and chicks of ground-nesting birds and has been known to kill birds up to a pound in weight (especially domestic poultry). It turns over the droppings of herbivorous mammals for insects.

===Nesting===
Nesting is almost always in trees, usually near the top, but has been known to nest in shrubs infrequently. Usually, three or four eggs are incubated about 18–19 days and hatchlings are fledged by around 38 days. Typically, only three nestlings survive.

===Voice===
The voice is described as a &quot;krrah...krrah...krrah&quot; or a quicker &quot;kah-kah-kah&quot;. It also makes very loud, liquid bubbling sounds that carry quite a distance; it also gives throaty chuckles. Some evidence indicates that vocal mimicry is practised, too.

<text>Bernardino of Siena, OFM (Bernardine or Bernadine; 8 September 138020 May 1444), was an Italian Catholic priest and Franciscan missionary preacher in Italy. He was a systematizer of scholastic economics. 

His preaching, his book burnings, and his &quot;bonfires of the vanities&quot; established his reputation in his own lifetime; they were frequently directed against gambling, infanticide, sorcery/witchcraft, sodomy (chiefly among homosexual males), Jews, Romani &quot;Gypsies&quot;, usury, and the like. 

Bernardino was canonised by Pope Nicholas V in 1450 and is referred to as &quot;the Apostle of Italy&quot; for his efforts to revive the country&#x27;s Catholicism during the 15th century.

==Sources==
Two hagiographies of Bernardino of Siena were written by two of his friends; the one the same year in which he died, by Barnaba of Siena; the other by the humanist Maffeo Vegio. Another important contemporary biographical source is that written by the Sienese diplomat Leonardo Benvoglienti, who was another personal acquaintance of Bernardino&#x27;s. The historian Franco Mormando notes that &quot;[t]he first works to be produced about Bernardine right after his death [in 1444] were biographical: by the year 1480, there were already over a dozen written accounts of the preacher&#x27;s life&quot;.

==Life==
===Early life===
Bernardino was born in 1380 to the noble Albizzeschi family in Massa Marittima, Tuscany, a town in the &quot;contado&quot; of Siena of which his father, Albertollo degli Albizzeschi, was then governor. Left orphaned at six, he was raised by a pious aunt. In 1397, after a course of civil and canon law, he joined the Confraternity of Our Lady attached to the hospital of Santa Maria della Scala. Three years later, when the plague visited Siena, he ministered to the plague-stricken, and, assisted by ten companions, took upon himself for four months entire charge of this hospital. He escaped the plague but was so exhausted that a fever confined him for several months. In 1403 he joined the Observant branch of the Order of Friars Minor (the Franciscan Order), with strict observance of Saint Francis&#x27;s Rule. Bernardino was ordained a priest in 1404 and was commissioned as a preacher the next year. In about 1406 Saint Vincent Ferrer, a Dominican friar and missionary, while preaching at Alessandria in the Piedmont region of Italy, allegedly foretold that his mantle should descend upon one who was then listening to him, and said that he would return to France and Spain, leaving to Bernardino the task of evangelizing the remaining peoples of Italy.

===Bernardino as preacher===

====Preaching style====
Before Bernardino, most preachers either read a prepared speech or recited a rhetorical oration. Instead of remaining cloistered and preaching only during the liturgy, Bernardino preached directly to the public. For more than 30 years, he preached all over Italy and played a great part in the religious revival of the early fifteenth century. Although he had a weak and hoarse voice, he is said to have been one of the greatest preachers of his time. His style was simple, familiar, and abounding in imagery. Cynthia Polecritti, in her biography of Bernardino, notes that the texts of his sermons &quot;are acknowledged masterpieces of colloquial Italian&quot;. He was an elegant and captivating preacher, and his use of popular imagery and creative language drew large crowds to hear his reflections. Invitations were often extended by the civil authorities rather than the ecclesiastical, as sometimes the towns would make money from the crowds that came to hear him.

Unlike many of his contemporaries, Bernardino chose his themes not from the daily liturgy, but from the ordinary lives of the people of Siena. He selected biblical themes to focus on the immediate interests of his audience. This proved effective in drawing their attention. Women comprised the majority of listeners, and the size of the crowd varied according to the day, time, and topic of the sermon. Polecritti notes that the subject matter of his sermons reveals much about the contemporary context of 15th-century Italy.

Bernardino travelled from place to place, remaining nowhere more than a few weeks. These journeys were all made on foot. In the towns, the crowds assembled to hear him were at times so great that it became necessary to erect a pulpit on the marketplace. Like Vincent Ferrer, he usually preached at dawn. His hearers, so as to ensure themselves standing room, would arrive beforehand, many coming from far-distant villages. The sermons often lasted three or four hours. He was invited to Ferrara in 1424, where he preached against the excess of luxury and immodest apparel. In Bologna, he spoke out against gambling, much to the dissatisfaction of the card manufacturers and sellers. Returning to Siena in April 1425, he preached there for 50 consecutive days. His success was said to be remarkable. &quot;Bonfires of the Vanities&quot; were held at his sermon sites, where people threw mirrors, high-heeled shoes, perfumes, locks of false hair, cards, dice, chess pieces, and other frivolities to be burned. Bernardino enjoined his listeners to abstain from blasphemy, indecent conversation, and games of chance, and to observe feast days.

Bernardino was not universally popular. In L&#x27;Aquila, someone once sawed the legs of the pulpit, causing him to fall into the crowd.

In 1427, Bernardino was called to Siena to allay factional strife; however, he preferred preaching to being an arbitrator. When he spoke against factions and vendettas, he was uncharacteristically tactful. To Policretti, this suggests that the situation could have become violent at the smallest provocation.

Both while he was alive and after his death (the first edition of his works, for the most part elaborate sermons, was printed at Lyon in 1501), the legacy of Bernardino was far from tame: of a strict, moral temper, he preached fiery sermons against many classes of people and these were riddled with denunciations. He characterized some women as &quot;witches&quot;, and called for sodomites to be ostracized or otherwise removed from the human community. He thus was a champion of what historian Robert Moore called &quot;the persecuting society&quot; of late medieval Christian Europe.

====On women====
The historian Franco Mormando notes that in the twenty large volumes of Bernardino&#x27;s extant printed works, the saint has much to say about women and to women, &quot;married, unmarried, widowed, and those enclosed in nunneries&quot;. However, at the end of his study, &quot;Bernardino of Siena: &#x27;Great Defender&#x27; or &#x27;Merciless Betrayer&#x27; of Women?&quot;, Mormando concludes: &quot;...despite his sincere moments of greater empathy with women, Bernardino proves to be very much in the mainstream of writings on women of the Trecento and Quattrocento ... Though, in his compassion for her, Bernardine would have the woman&#x27;s domestic and social &#x27;cage&#x27; be as comfortable and as humane as possible, it is there in the same traditional cage that Bernardino nonetheless wants her to remain, under the guard of father, brother, husband, or parish priest.&quot;

Bernardino presented the Virgin Mary as an example for women. He advised girls never to talk to a man unless one of their parents was present. In one sermon Bernardino cautions women about marrying men who care more for their dowries than for them. On one occasion he asked mothers to come to church with their daughters alone so that he speak to them frankly about sexual abuse in marriage. He also spoke against the confinement of unwilling girls to convents. He presented Saint Joseph as an example for men, while emphasizing Mary&#x27;s obedience to her husband.

====Against sodomy and homosexuality====

On sodomy (predominantly directed towards homosexual men), Bernardino keenly pointed out the reputation of the Italians beyond their own borders. In the same work is a detailed analysis of Bernardino&#x27;s preaching against witchcraft and Jews. He particularly decried Florentine lenience towards men having sex with men; in Verona, he approvingly reminded listeners that a man was quartered and his limbs hung from the city gates for homosexual intercourse; in Genoa, men were regularly burned if found guilty of sodomy; and in Venice a sodomite had been tied to a column along with a barrel of pitch and brushwood and set on fire. He advised the people of Siena to do the same. In 1424 he dedicated three consecutive sermons in Florence to the subject, in the course of a Lenten sermon preached in Santa Croce, he admonished his hearers:
In Siena, Bernardino preached a full sermon against sodomy, including homosexuality, in 1425 and then 1427; linking it directly with fears about the depopulation as it did not lead to children and was therefore unproductive: &quot;You don&#x27;t understand that [sodomy] is the reason you have lost half your population over the last twenty-five years&quot;. Over time his teachings helped mould public sentiment and dispel indifference over controlling sodomy and homosexual conduct more vigorously. Everything unpredictable or calamitous in human experience he attributed to sodomy, including floods and the plague, as well as linking the practice to local population decline. After one of his sermons in Siena, four &quot;irate sodomites&quot; attempted to beat him with clubs.

===Trial in Rome===
Especially known for his devotion to the Holy Name of Jesus, which was previously associated with John of Vercelli and the Dominican order, Bernardino devised a symbol—IHS—the first three letters of the name of Jesus in Greek, in Gothic letters on a blazing sun. This was to displace the insignia of factions (for example, Guelphs and Ghibellines). The devotion spread, and the symbol began to appear in churches, homes and public buildings. Opponents thought it a dangerous innovation.

In 1426, Bernardino was summoned to Rome to stand trial on charges of heresy himself for his promotion of this devotion to the Holy Name of Jesus. Theologians including Paul of Venice gave their opinions. Bernardino was found innocent of heresy, and he impressed Pope Martin V sufficiently that Martin requested he preach in Rome. He thereupon preached every day for 80 days. Bernardino&#x27;s zeal was such that he would prepare up to four drafts of a sermon before starting to speak. That same year, he was offered the bishopric of Siena, but declined in order to maintain his monastic and evangelical activities. In 1431, he toured Tuscany, Lombardy, Romagna, and Ancona before returning to Siena to prevent a war against Florence. Also in 1431, he declined the bishopric of Ferrara, and in 1435 he declined the bishopric of Urbino.

John of Capistrano was Bernardino&#x27;s friend, and James of the Marches was his disciple during these years. Cardinals urged both Pope Martin V and Pope Eugene IV to condemn Bernardino, but both almost instantly acquitted him. A trial at the Council of Florence also ended with an acquittal. The Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund sought Bernardino&#x27;s counsel and intercession and Bernardino accompanied him to Rome in 1433 for his coronation.

===&quot;On Contracts and Usury&quot;===
====Economic theory====
Bernardino was the first theologian after Peter John Olivi to write an entire work systematically devoted to Scholastic economics. His greatest contribution to economics was a discussion and defence of the entrepreneur. His book, &quot;On Contracts and Usury&quot;, written during the years 1431–1433, dealt with the justification of private property, the ethics of trade, the determination of value and price, and the usury question.

One of his contributions was a discussion on the functions of the business entrepreneur, whom Bernardino saw as performing the useful social function of transporting, distributing, or manufacturing goods. According to Murray Rothbard, Bernardino&#x27;s insight in determining just value prefigured &quot;...the Jevons/Austrian analysis of supply and cost over five centuries later.&quot; He extended this to a theory of the &quot;just wage&quot;, which would be determined by the demand for labour and the available supply. Wage inequality is a function of differences in skill, ability and training. Skilled workers are scarcer than unskilled so that the former will command a higher wage.

====Usury====
Usury was one of the principal objects of Bernardino&#x27;s attacks, and he did much to prepare the way for the establishment of the beneficial loan societies, known as Monti di Pietà.

Bernardino followed the earlier scholastic philosophers Anselm of Canterbury and Thomas Aquinas (who quotes Aristotle) in condemning the practice of usury, which they defined as charging interest on a loan. Scholastic analysis of usury, based in part on Roman law, was both complex and, in some instances, seemingly contradictory. Interest on delayed payment was deemed valid as it was considered compensation for damages suffered by the creditor being deprived of his property.

Bernardino saw usury as concentrating all the money of the city into a few hands. However, he accepted the theory of &quot;lucrum cessans&quot;, interest charged to compensate for profits foregone in lieu of capital investment. A distinction was also drawn for joint ventures, in which the creditor assumed some portion of the risk.

In Milan, he was visited by a merchant who urged him to inveigh strenuously against usury, only to find that his visitor was himself a prominent usurer, whose activities were prompted by a wish to lessen competition.

====Anti-Semitism====
Bernardino is particularly regarded today as being a &quot;major protagonist of Christian anti-semitism&quot;.
In January 1427 he was in Orvieto, where he preached on the topic of usury, urging the executive to take stringent steps against all such as were addicted to this business, many of whom were Jews. Blaming the poverty of local Christians on Jewish usury, his call for Jews to be banished and isolated from their wider communities led to segregation. His audiences often used his words to reinforce actions against Jews, and his preaching left a legacy of resentment on the part of Jews.

===Franciscan Vicar General===
Soon thereafter, he withdrew again to Serracapriola to compose a further series of sermons. He resumed his missionary labours in 1436 but was forced to abandon them when he became vicar-general of the Observant branch of the Franciscans in Italy in 1438.

Bernardino had worked to grow the Observants from the outset of his religious life: although he was not in fact its founder (the origins of the Observants, or &quot;Zelanti&quot;, can be traced back to the middle of the fourteenth century). Nevertheless, Bernardino became to the Observants what Saint Bernard had been to the Cistercians, their principal support and indefatigable propagator. Instead of one hundred and thirty Friars constituting the Observance in Italy at Bernardino&#x27;s reception into the order, it counted over four thousand shortly before his death. Bernardino also founded, or reformed, at least three hundred convents of Friars. He sent missionaries to different parts of Asia, and it was largely through his efforts that many ambassadors from different schismatical nations attended the Council of Florence, where he addressed the assembled Fathers in Greek.

Being Vicar General inevitably cut back his opportunities to preach, but he continued to speak to the public when he could. Having in 1442 persuaded the Pope to finally accept his resignation as Vicar-General so that he might give himself more undividedly to preaching, Bernardino again resumed his missionary work. Despite the papal bull issued by Pope Eugene IV in 1443, &quot;Illius qui se pro divini&quot;, which charged Bernardino to preach the indulgence for the Crusade against the Turks, there is no record of his having done so. In 1444, notwithstanding his increasing infirmities, Bernardino, desirous that there should be no part of Italy which had not heard his voice, set out to the Kingdom of Naples.

Bernardino died that year at L&#x27;Aquila in Abruzzo and is buried in the Basilica of San Bernardino. According to tradition, his grave continued to leak blood until two factions of the city achieved reconciliation.

==Canonisation and iconography==

Reports of miracles attributed to Bernardino multiplied rapidly after his death, and he was canonized in 1450, only six years after his death, by Pope Nicholas V. His feast day in the Roman Catholic Church is on 20 May, the day of his death.

Mormando observes that &quot;Bernardino&#x27;s lifetime coincided with the blossoming not only of art in general but also of full-fledged, realistic portraiture as a distinct genre. This may explain why Bernardino, it seems, has the distinction of being the first saint in Church history for whom we have an indisputably authentic portrait in art. Many of the earliest portraits were presumably based on his death mask...&quot; Bernardino also lived into the early days of the print and was the subject of portraits in his lifetime, as well as a death-mask, which were copied to make prints, so that he is one of the earliest saints to have a fairly consistent appearance in art; though many Baroque images, such as that by El Greco, are idealized compared to the realistic ones made in the decades after his death.

After his death, the Franciscans promoted an iconographical program of diffusion of images of Bernardino, which was second only to that of the founder of the order. As such, he is one of the earliest saints whose appearance was given a distinct and readily recognisable iconography. Artists of the late medieval and Renaissance periods often represented him as small and emaciated, with three mitres at his feet (representing the three bishoprics which he had rejected) and holding in his hand the &quot;IHS&quot; monogram with rays emanating from it (representing his devotion to the &quot;Holy Name of Jesus&quot;), which was his main attribute. He appears to have been a favourite in the works of Luca della Robbia, and one of the finest examples of Renaissance art includes relief carvings of the saint, which can be seen in the oratory of Perugia Cathedral.

A portrait is known to have circulated in Siena just after the death of Bernardino which, on the basis of physiognomic similarities with his death mask at L&#x27;Aquila, is believed to have been a good likeness. It is thought probable that many subsequent depictions of the saint derive from this portrait.

The most famous depictions of Bernardino are found in the cycle of frescoes of his life, which were executed towards the end of the fifteenth century by Pinturicchio in the Bufalini Chapel of Santa Maria in Aracoeli, Rome.

===Veneration===
Saint Bernardino is the Roman Catholic patron saint of advertising, communications, compulsive gambling, respiratory problems, as well as any problems involving the chest area. He is the patron saint of Carpi, Italy; the Philippine barangays of Kay-Anlog in Calamba, Laguna and Tuna in Cardona, Rizal; and the diocese of San Bernardino, California, USA. Siena College, a Franciscan Catholic liberal arts college in New York, USA, was named after him and placed under his spiritual patronage. The mountain pass in the Alps, &quot;Il Passo di San Bernardino&quot;, is named in honour of the saint, whose fame reached well into northern Italy and southern Switzerland.

His cult was transferred in 1453 to Poland by John of Capistrano, the same year the first Observant Friars monastery in Poland was founded in Kraków, whose namesake became Bernardino of Siena. From the monastery&#x27;s name came the name of Bernardines, by which the Franciscan Observants were known in the lands of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. His cult also spread to England at an early period, and was particularly promulgated by the Observant Friars, who first established themselves in the country in Greenwich, in 1482, not forty years after his death, but who were later suppressed.

<text>British Satellite Broadcasting plc (BSB) was a television company, based in London, that provided direct broadcast satellite television services to the United Kingdom. It started broadcasting on 25 March 1990. The company was merged with Sky Television plc on 2 November 1990 to form British Sky Broadcasting.

==Development==
In January 1977, the World Administrative Radio Conference assigned each country five high-powered direct broadcast by satellite channels for domestic use. In 1982, after being awarded two of the channels, the BBC proposed its own satellite service, but the government imposed two conditions on it:
* Use of a satellite built by United Satellite, a consortium of British Aerospace and Matra Marconi Space (now Airbus Defense and Space), with costs estimated at £24 million per year.
* A supplementary charter was agreed in May 1983 which allowed the BBC to borrow up to £225 million to cover the cost of the project, as it was not allowed to call on public funds, nor use existing sources of revenue to fund the project.

During Autumn 1983, the cost of Unisat was found to be greatly underestimated and the new Home Secretary announced the three remaining channels would be given to the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) to allow the private sector to compete against the BBC in satellite broadcasting. Within a few months, the BBC started talking with the IBA about a joint project to help cover the cost. Subsequently, the government allowed the IBA to bring in private companies to help cover the costs (dubbed as the &quot;Club of 21&quot;):
* BBC – 50%
* ITV franchises – 30% 
* Virgin/Thorn EMI/Granada TV Rental/Pearson Longman and Consolidated Satellite Broadcasting – 20%

Within a year, the consortium made it clear that the original launch date of 1986 would be delayed to 1989, while also asking the government to allow it to tender out the building of the new satellite system to help reduce cost. On 15 June 1985, the project failed when consortium concluded that the cost of set-up was not justifiable. The BBC stated the costs were prohibitive because the government insisted that the &quot;Club of 21&quot; should pay for the costs of constructing and launching a dedicated satellite.

===IBA satellite franchise===
On 2 April 1986, the IBA convinced the Home Secretary to revive the DBS project but under different conditions, broadly based on a report drawn up by John Jackson, by inviting the private-sector companies to apply for a new television franchise via satellite to provide a commercial service on the IBA&#x27;s three DBS channels (of the five in total allocated to the United Kingdom). One of the conditions imposed on applicants by the IBA was that they use a new untried transmission standard, D-MAC. This was part of the European Communities&#x27; support for the HD-MAC high-definition television standard which was being developed by Philips and other European companies. The technology was still at the laboratory stage and was incompatible with previous standards: HD-MAC transmissions could not be received by existing television sets which used PAL or SECAM standards. The condition to use a high-power (230 watt) satellite was dropped, and no winner was precluded from buying a foreign satellite system.

The IBA received five major contenders with serious bids for the direct broadcast satellite franchises. It also received submissions from The Children&#x27;s Channel and ITN to make sure their programmes were used on any successful bid:
====Winning bid====
British Satellite Broadcasting won the 15-year franchise on 11 December 1986 to operate the DBS system, with a licence to operate three channels. BSB forecast 400,000 homes would be equipped during its first year, but some doubts were cast as to whether this was possible. The Cable Authority welcomed the service, believing it would encourage more users, especially with its dedicated movie network. The original four satellite channels were:
==Preparations for launch==
Around the time of the licence award, Amstrad withdrew its backing, as they believed it was not possible to sell a satellite dish and D-MAC standard receiver for £250. Australian businessman Alan Bond joined the consortium along with Reed Elsevier, Chargeurs, Next and London Merchant Securities, amongst others. BSB earmarked the bulk of the first round of financing for buying and launching two satellites (for redundancy and provision of further channels later) and planned a second round close to the commencement of broadcasting operations. It commissioned the Hughes Aircraft Company to provide two high-powered satellites using launch vehicles from McDonnell Douglas (later United Launch Alliance). Both companies were American and had established reputations for reliability. Hughes was the main contractor and offered a commercial space industry as the first &quot;in-orbit delivery&quot; on 6 August 1987. BSB&#x27;s risk was reduced because payments became due only after the satellites were launched and operational.

On 8 June 1988, rival tycoon Rupert Murdoch – having failed to gain regulatory approval for his satellite service to become part of the BSB consortium – announced that his pan-European television station &quot;Sky Channel&quot;, would be relaunched as a four-channel, United Kingdom-based service called Sky Television, using the Astra system and broadcast in PAL with analogue sound. BSB had been aware of the impending launch of Astra when it submitted its proposal to the IBA in 1986 but had discounted it, partly on advice from the IBA that it would not have been possible for Sky to securely scramble an analogue PAL signal and a prediction that satisfactory reception from a medium-powered satellite such as Astra would not be possible with a dish of under 1.2 metres, which would require individual planning permission for each customer. Lazard Brothers, the Pearson subsidiary responsible for BSB&#x27;s first fundraising memorandum, reportedly regarded Astra as technology-led rather than programming-led and, therefore, an unlikely threat.
The stage was set for a dramatic confrontation: BSB, expecting to be the United Kingdom&#x27;s only satellite service, was faced with an aggressive drive by Murdoch&#x27;s Sky to be the first service to launch. As Britain&#x27;s official satellite television provider, BSB had high hopes as the company planned to provide a mixture of highbrow programming and popular entertainment, from arts and opera to blockbuster movies and music videos. The service would also be technically superior, broadcasting in the D-MAC (Multiplexed Analogue Components type D) system dictated by the European Union regulations with potentially superior picture sharpness, digital stereo sound, and the potential to show widescreen programming; rather than the existing PAL system. BSB claimed that Sky&#x27;s PAL pictures would be too degraded by satellite transmission, and that in any case, BSB would broadcast superior programming. SES (later operators of the O3b data satellites and others with names including AMC, Ciel, NSS, QuetzSat, YahSat and SES, and formerly at that time, the Astra TV satellite operator), had no regulatory permission to broadcast, had plans (initially) for only one satellite with no backup, and the European satellite launch vehicle &quot;Ariane&quot; suffered repeated failures. However, SES used the resulting delay time to re-engineer the satellite to reduce the dish size needed, which would otherwise have been larger than 60 cm (24&quot;).

To distance itself from Sky and its dish antennas, BSB announced a new type of flat-plate satellite antenna called a &quot;squarial&quot; (i.e., &quot;square aerial&quot;). The illustrative model shown to the press was a dummy and BSB commissioned a working version under 45 cm (18&quot;) wide. A conventional dish of the same diameter was also available. The company had serious technical problems with the development of ITT&#x27;s D-MAC silicon chips needed for its MAC receivers. BSB was still hoping to launch in September 1989 but eventually had to admit that the launch would be delayed. By 22 July 1988 in a bid to gain more viewers, BSB and the BBC prepared a bid for a four-year deal for the rights to broadcast top league football, outbidding ITV&#x27;s £44 million offer. BSB had also committed about £400 million to tie up the film libraries of Paramount, Universal, Columbia and MGM/United Artists, with total up-front payments of about £85 million.
On 1 February 1989, BSB&#x27;s costs had started to climb, reaching £354 million, while chief executive Anthony Simonds-Gooding denied that BSB had gone over budget and would require more than the planned £625 million it required to operate up to 1993. Virgin pulled out of the BSB consortium in December 1988, ostensibly because it was going private again and had become increasingly concerned about BSB&#x27;s mounting costs. The film-rights battle proved to be the final straw for Virgin since it would necessitate a &quot;supplementary first round&quot; of financing of £131 million in January earlier that year in addition to the initial £222.5 million. After unsuccessfully offering its stake in BSB to the remaining founders, Virgin sold it to the Bond Corporation, already BSB&#x27;s largest shareholder for a nominal profit.

Despite the delayed launch, BSB continued to invest heavily in marketing in 1989 to minimize the effects of Sky&#x27;s timing advantage. BSB also received a needed boost in June 1989 when it won the franchises for the two remaining British high-powered DBS channels, beating six other bidders when the BBC dropped all plans for use of its allocated channels. BSB revised its line-up to include separate channels for films, sports, pop music, general entertainment and current affairs. Unfortunately, this increased the size of the dishes which the public had to purchase from 25 to 35–40 centimetres; subsidies from BSB helped maintain retail prices at £250.

==Launch of five-channel service==
There were five satellite channels for the general public with a sixth part-time service on subscription for business users, as BSB Datavision was a subsidiary of the company which offered encrypted television sets and data reception through domestic receivers. BSB&#x27;s channel line-up launched over five consecutive days in one at a time was:

BSB launched its service on cable 25 March 1990 and on satellite at the end of April, with the slogan &quot;It&#x27;s Smart to be Square&quot;. The launch, six months late, came 13 months after Sky&#x27;s launch. BSB was due to start broadcasting in September 1989 but was delayed by problems with the supply of receiving equipment and because BSB wanted to avoid Sky&#x27;s experience of launching when most shops had no equipment to sell.

BSB claimed to have around 750,000 subscriptions while Sky had extended its reach into more than 1.5 million homes. It was believed both companies could break even if subscriptions reached three million households, with most analysts expecting this to be reached in 1992.

==Competition and merger==
Sky&#x27;s head start over BSB proved that the PAL system would give adequate picture quality, and that many viewers would be happy to watch Sky&#x27;s more populist output as opposed to waiting for the promised quality programming pledged by BSB. Sky had launched its multichannel service from studios at an industrial estate in Isleworth, with a 10-year lease on SES transponders for an estimated £50 million without backup. BSB on the other hand, would operate from more expensive headquarters at Marco Polo House in Battersea, with construction and launch of its own satellites costing an estimated £200 million as the second of which was a backup.

When BSB finally went on air in March 1990 (13 months after Sky), the company&#x27;s technical problems were resolved and its programming was critically acclaimed. However, its D-MAC receivers were more expensive than Sky&#x27;s PAL equivalents and incompatible with them. Many potential customers compared the competition between the rival satellite companies to the format war between VHS and Betamax recorders, and chose to wait and see which company would win outright in order to avoid buying potentially obsolete equipment. Both BSB and Sky had begun to struggle with the burden of huge losses, rapidly increasing debts and ongoing startup costs. On 2 November 1990, a 50:50 merger was announced to form a single company called British Sky Broadcasting (marketed as &quot;Sky&quot;).

Following the merger, BSkyB moved quickly to rationalise the combined channels it now owned:
===Outcomes===
BSB&#x27;s shareholders and Murdoch&#x27;s News International made huge profits on their investments, the 50:50 merged venture having an effective quasi-monopoly on British satellite pay-television. From a United Kingdom perspective, British Satellite Broadcasting&#x27;s existence prevented 100% of these profits being made by News International, reducing Murdoch&#x27;s ability to influence government policy. At one stage of the saga, News International was facing dismemberment at the hands of its bankers.

Following the takeover of Sky by Comcast in October 2018, Murdoch was no longer involved in British television but retained his newspaper assets through News Corp.

===Satellites===
As the company focused on the Astra system which was not subject to IBA regulation, the Marcopolo satellites were eventually withdrawn and later sold (Marcopolo 1 on 21 December 1993 to NSAB of Sweden and Marcopolo 2 on 1 July 1992 to Telenor of Norway). NSAB operated Marcopolo 1 (as Sirius 1) until successfully sending it to a safe disposal orbit in 2003 as it reached the normal end of its operational life when fuel ran out. Marcopolo 2 was operated (as Thor 1) until January 2002 and disposed of successfully.

==Regulatory context==
A new television transmission system, Multiplexed Analogue Components, was originally developed for high-definition television but European manufacturers developed patented variants and successfully lobbied regulators such that it was adopted by the Commission of the European Communities as the standard for all direct broadcast satellites. This had the effect that the low-cost non-European manufacturers would not only have to pay royalties to the manufacturers, but would also not have direct access to the technology, and hence would always be behind with new developments.

In the United Kingdom, the Independent Broadcasting Authority developed a variant, D-MAC, which had marginal audio channel improvements, and insisted on its use by the satellite service to be licensed by itself. In the rest of Europe, satellite television manufacturers standardised on another variant, D2-MAC, which used less bandwidth and was compatible with the extensive existing European cable systems. With the launch of BSB, the IBA became a member of the secret &quot;MAC Club&quot; of European organisations which owned patents on MAC variants and had a royalty-sharing agreement for all television and set-top boxes sold. 

The IBA was not directed to be an &quot;economic regulator&quot;, so the free market in lower power satellite bandwidth satellites (such as SES Astra) leveraged the benefits of the existing lower cost PAL transmissions with pre-existing set-top box technology. The IBA was rendered helpless and Murdoch voluntarily agreed to adhere to those Broadcasting Standards Commission rules relating to non-economic matters, such as the technology used. Ironically the past-deadline encryption system in the D-MAC silicon chip technology was one primary reason for BSB having to merge with Sky, and hence the Far Eastern television manufacturers had largely unfettered access to the market when MAC was wound down in favour of PAL.

After the merger, BSB D-MAC receivers were sold off cheaply and some enthusiasts modified them to allow reception of D2-MAC services available on other satellites. BSB receivers, Ferguson in particular, could be modified by replacing a microprocessor. Upgrade kits from companies such as Trac Satellite allowed re-tuning whilst other kits allowed fully working menu systems and decoding of &#x27;soft&#x27; encrypted channels, although this required the receiver to have one of the later MAC chipsets. Some kits even included smart card readers and full D2-MAC decoding capability.

==Location==

Marco Polo House (originally stylised as &quot;Marcopolo&quot;) was a large marble-effect, glass-clad office building at 346 Queenstown Road, facing Battersea Park in the London Borough of Wandsworth. It was built in 1987–1988 and completed in 1989 by Peter Argyrou Associates at a cost of £26 million.

The headquarters were vacated, leading to redundancy for most BSB staff with only a few moving to work at Sky Television&#x27;s studios in Isleworth. The building was retained by the new company and from 1 October 1993 became the home of shopping channel QVC when its British version launched. Broadcasting platform ITV Digital also moved into part of the building as part of the settlement that saw Sky forced out of the original company before went into administration on 27 March 2002.

The building was demolished in March 2014; it has been replaced by several blocks of luxury apartments.

<text>Karl Lueger (; 24 October 1844 – 10 March 1910) was an Austrian lawyer and politician who served as Mayor of Vienna from 1897 until his death in 1910. He is credited with the transformation of Vienna into a modern city at the turn of the 20th century, although the populist and antisemitic politics of the Austrian Christian Social Party (CS), which he founded and led until his death, remain controversial, as they are sometimes viewed as a model for Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Nazism.

== Life and early career ==
Karl Lueger came from a modest background, born at Wieden (since 1850 the 4th district of Vienna) to Leopold Lueger of Neustadtl an der Donau and his wife Juliane.
His birthplace is now the western part of the main building of the Vienna University of Technology at Karlsplatz where Lueger&#x27;s father worked as an usher at the Vienna Polytechnic.

He nevertheless was able to attend the renowned Theresianum boarding school (&quot;Theresianische Ritterakademie&quot;) as a day student. He studied law at the University of Vienna, receiving his doctorate in 1870. While at the university he was a member of the Catholic Student Association (&quot;Katholische akademische Verbindung Norica Wien&quot;, K.A.V. Norica Wien), part of the &quot;Österreichische Cartellverband&quot; (ÖCV) fraternities.

He established his own lawyer&#x27;s office in Vienna in 1874 and soon became known as a &quot;little people&#x27;s&quot; („&quot;kleine Leute&quot;“) advocate. In this position, his role model and mentor was the popular Jewish physician and local politician Ignaz Mandl , known as &quot;God of the Little People&quot; in Lueger&#x27;s district of Landstraße (Third District), whom he followed into political life. The association ended when Lueger became identified with antisemitism. He died in 1910.

== Political career ==
Lueger played a part in many political spheres, including Vienna City Council where he eventually became mayor, the federal Austrian parliament, and the state parliament of Lower Austria.

=== Viennese municipal politics ===


In 1875, he was elected to Vienna&#x27;s City Council (&quot;Gemeinderat&quot;), initially as a liberal. He would serve on the council until his death, save for a two-year break from 1876 to 1878. He campaigned against the government of liberal mayor Cajetan Felder and achieved popularity as a campaigner against corruption.

In 1888 he brought together the German National (&quot;Deutschnationale&quot;) and Christian Social factions at City Hall to form a group that later became known as the United Christians (&quot;Vereinigte Christen&quot;).

After the 1895 elections for the Vienna &quot;Gemeinderat&quot;, the Christian Socials won two thirds of the seats, ending the long Liberal rule. The Christian Social supermajority subsequently elected Lueger as mayor. However, during imperial times, mayors had to be confirmed in office by Emperor Franz Joseph. The emperor allegedly loathed Lueger as a person and considered him a dangerous revolutionary. He was also concerned about Lueger&#x27;s antisemitism. With the support of Prime Minister Kasimir Felix Badeni, Franz Joseph refused to confirm Lueger as mayor. The Christian Socials retained a large majority in the council, and reelected Lueger as mayor three more times, only to have Franz Joseph refuse to confirm him each time. He was elected mayor for a fifth time in 1897, and after a personal intercession by Pope Leo XIII, his election was finally sanctioned later that year.

He was a zealous Catholic and wished to “capture the university” for the Church. He would have neither Social Democrats nor Pan-Germans nor Jews in the municipal administration. He secured good treatment for Czech immigrants.

He planned to make Vienna one of the most beautiful of garden cities.

In his incumbency, Lueger is credited with the extension of the public water supply by its second main aquifer (&quot;Hochquellwasserleitung&quot;), which provides tap water of mineral-water quality to large parts of the city. He also pursued the municipalization of gas and electricity works as well as the establishment of a public transport system, introducing streetcars (trams), and of numerous institutions of social welfare, most of which strongly relied on debt financing. He incorporated the suburbs, and built parks, gardens, hospitals, and schools.

&quot;Der schöne Karl&quot; (&quot;handsome Karl&quot;) achieved tremendous popularity among the citizens. During his tenure, Vienna ultimately changed its appearance as the capital of a great power of the pre-World War I era—a heritage that remained even in Red Vienna after the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918. A significant part of the infrastructure and organisations that are responsible for the high standard of living in the contemporary city were created during his terms of office.

Lueger served as mayor of Vienna until his early death from diabetes mellitus in 1910. He was buried in the crypt of the newly erected St. Charles Borromeo Church at the Zentralfriedhof (also called Dr. Karl Lueger Memorial Church), whose groundbreaking ceremony he had performed.

=== Christian Social movement ===
Lueger&#x27;s early political life was associated with Georg von Schönerer and the German National Party, which was antisemitic. From the late 1880s onwards Lueger was a regular attendee at the influential circles of clerical social conservative politicians around Karl von Vogelsang, Prince Aloys Franz de Paula Maria of Liechtenstein, and the theologian Franz Martin Schindler. In view of the rising labour movement, the participants on the basis of Catholic social teaching developed ideas to overcome social polarisation by several measures of social security legislation and the common Catholic faith. Moreover, after an 1882 electoral reform had expanded the electorate suffrage, Lueger focused on petty bourgeois tradespersons, who assumed the Jewish competition to be the underlying cause of their precarious situation, and discovered that raising the &quot;Jewish Question&quot; earned him enormous popularity.

In 1885 he was elected to the lower house (&quot;Abgeordnetenhaus&quot;) of the Austrian Imperial Parliament (&quot;Reichsrat&quot;), representing the Fifth District of Vienna, and was returned in the 1891 election. From 1890 he was also a member of the Lower Austria parliament (&quot;Landtag&quot;).
Lueger, Prince Liechtenstein, Vogelsang and Schindler met regularly at the &quot;Hotel Zur goldenen Ente&quot; (Golden Duck, Riemergasse 4) in Vienna&#x27;s First District, and would refer to their meetings as &quot;Enten-Abende&quot; (Duck Evenings). This working group became the focus for social reform, and they organised the Second Austrian Katholikentag in 1889. From this Schindler developed the platform of the fledgling Christian Social Party (&quot;Christlichsoziale Partei&quot;, CS). Lueger was to found and lead the party in 1893, which quickly rivaled the Social Democrats (&quot;Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreichs&quot;, SPÖ). He remained one of its most effective leaders till his death and developed his party&#x27;s federation policy as a means of dealing with the monarchy&#x27;s issues of multiple nationalities.

Much of Lueger&#x27;s popularity stemmed from his appeal to women; his female followers were variously known as &quot;Lueger&#x27;s Amazons&quot;, &quot;the Lueger Garde&quot; or &quot;Lueger Gretls&quot; and were organised in the Christian Social Women&#x27;s League. Although women could not vote, he calculated that they could significantly influence how their menfolk voted, and they also inculcated the party ideology in their children. To maintain his female following, Lueger remained a bachelor and publicly disavowed any private life, claiming that he was too busy because he belonged totally to &quot;my Viennese&quot;. After his death there was a scandal when his long-time mistress, Marianne Beskiba, published a tell-all memoir including facsimiles of love letters from him; the book provides useful information about his political tactics and how the party was run.

=== Antisemitism ===
Lueger was known for his antisemitic rhetoric and referred to himself as an admirer of Edouard Drumont, who founded the Antisemitic League of France in 1889. Decades later, Adolf Hitler, an inhabitant of Vienna from 1907 to 1913, saw him as an inspiration for his own views on Jews. Though not an explicit pan-Germanist, Lueger advocated racist policies against non-German speaking minorities in Austria-Hungary and in 1887 voted for a bill proposed by his long-time opponent Georg von Schönerer to restrict the immigration of Russian and Romanian Jews. He also overtly supported the völkisch movement of Guido von List and created the pun &quot;Judapest&quot;, referring to supposed Jewish domination of the Hungarian capital, Budapest. The historian Léon Poliakov wrote in &quot;The History of Anti-Semitism&quot;:

It soon became apparent that especially in Vienna any political group that wanted to appeal to the artisans had no chance of success without an anti-Semitic platform. [...] It was at that time that a well-known phrase was coined in Vienna: &quot;Anti-Semitism is the socialism of fools.&quot; The situation was exploited by the Catholic politician Karl Lueger, the leader of Austrian Christian-Social party with a program identical to that of the Berlin party of the same name led by Pastor Stoeker. In 1887, Lueger raised the banner of anti-Semitism. [...] However, the enthusiastic tribute that Hitler paid him in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; does not seem justified, for the Jews did not suffer under his administration.

Other observers contend that Lueger&#x27;s public racism was in large part a pose to obtain votes, being one of the first who made use of populism as a political tool. Historian William L. Shirer wrote that &quot;his opponents, including the Jews, readily conceded that he was at heart a decent, chivalrous, generous and tolerant man.&quot;
According to Amos Elon, &quot;Lueger&#x27;s anti-Semitism was of a homespun, flexible variety—one might almost say gemütlich. Asked to explain the fact that many of his friends were Jews, Lueger famously replied, &quot; &#x27;I decide who is a Jew.&#x27; &quot;&quot; Viennese Jewish writer Stefan Zweig, who grew up in Vienna during Lueger&#x27;s term of office, recalled that &quot;His city administration was perfectly just and even typically democratic.&quot;

=== German nationalism ===
Lueger expressed some scepticism about German nationalism, but as with his antisemitism was quick to exploit the sentiments for his own political purposes. He opposed Austro-Hungarian dualism in favour of federalism and the equality of all the nations making up the empire.

== Legacy ==

His general style of politics later inspired some of the right-wing leaders of the First Austrian Republic in 1918–1933, such as Ignaz Seipel, Engelbert Dollfuss and Kurt Schuschnigg, who led the Austrian society towards Austrofascism. Unlike Hitler, he did not so much inspire antisemitism in them (none of these three were particularly antisemitic), but rather provided one important role model for their generally combative, unrelenting stance towards ideological political opponents, which ultimately proved to be detrimental to the cohesion of the Austrian state.
In Vienna, Lueger has a square named after him, at least two statues were erected in his honour, and until April 2012 a section of the Ringstraße bore his name. It has been very difficult to decide what to do with monuments honouring historical figures whose reputation has been widely called into question as Europeans (and others) reflect on the historical background to the Holocaust. With the &quot;Anschluss&quot; of Austria in 1938 street names carrying Jewish names or the names of pacifists were changed. After World War II, Austria started a full-scale program of de-Nazification on both cultural and topographical levels. Nazified street signs were torn down and their names changed back from Nazi to Habsburg heroes. Lueger&#x27;s monuments present a difficult case because they are genuinely local, yet he was inspirational for the Nazis.

For some, the Lueger monuments show that Vienna has neglected its obligations to the victims of the Holocaust in order to keep its nostalgic appeal as the grand Imperial City. For example, when Austrian-born neurobiologist Eric Kandel won the Nobel Prize in 2000, he &quot;stuck it to the Austrians&quot; by saying it was certainly not an Austrian Nobel; it was a Jewish-American Nobel. He was subsequently telephoned by the Austrian president Thomas Klestil who asked him, &quot;How can we put things right?&quot; Kandel said that first, Dr.-Karl-Lueger-Ring should be renamed. Kandel was offended that the address of the University of Vienna is on that street. After yearlong debates, the Ring was renamed to &quot;Universitätsring&quot; in April 2012. The monument to Lueger at Dr. Karl Lueger Platz at the Stubenring as well as the memorial plaque at the TU Wien have since been contextualized by descriptions highlighting Lueger&#x27;s antisemitism and his influence on National Socialism.

Lueger was the subject of a 1943 biopic &quot;Vienna 1910&quot;, in which he was played by Rudolf Forster.

<text>The Education Bill was introduced in the Kerala assembly by Professor Joseph Mundasseri, who was then the education minister for the first elected (1957) Communist Party of India government. This bill was aimed at eradicating the malpractices prevalent in the private sector educational institutes, and attempted to regulate the educational institutions&#x27; function, including standardizing syllabi and pay structures. The Syrian Christian church and Nair Service Society, along with opposition parties, including Indian National Congress, started the political struggle to overthrow the E. M. S. Namboodiripad government.

The Education Bill sought to regulate appointments and conditions of teachers. Salaries of teachers were to be paid through the treasury. There was a provision of takeover of management of educational institutions, which arguably violated the constitution. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court rejected the appeal and the bill received the assent of the president of India.

Even though the Education Bill failed to pass through the Assembly, many of its provisions were later implemented by subsequent governments with amendments.

<text>The pratincoles or greywaders are a subfamily (Glareolinae) of birds which together with the coursers make up the family Glareolidae. They have short legs, very long pointed wings and long forked tails.

==Description==
Their most unusual feature for birds classed as waders is that they typically hunt their insect prey on the wing like swallows, although they can also feed on the ground. Their short bills are an adaptation to aerial feeding.

Their flight is fast and graceful like a swallow or a tern, with many twists and turns to pursue their prey. They are most active at dawn and dusk, resting in the warmest part of the day.

Like the coursers, the pratincoles are found in warmer parts of the Old World, from southern Europe and Africa east through Asia to Australia. Species breeding in temperate regions are long-distance migrants.

Their two to four eggs are laid on the ground in a bare scrape.

The downy pratincole chicks are able to run as soon as they are hatched.

The Australian pratincole, the only species not in the genus &quot;Glareola&quot;, is more terrestrial than the other pratincoles, and may be intermediate between this group and the coursers.

The name &quot;pratincole&quot; comes from the term &quot;pratincola&quot; coined by German naturalist Wilhelm Heinrich Kramer from the Latin words &quot;prātum&quot; meadow and &quot;incola&quot; resident.

==Species list==
* Genus &quot;Stiltia&quot;
** Australian pratincole &quot;Stiltia isabella&quot;
* Genus &quot;Glareola&quot;
** Collared pratincole &quot;Glareola pratincola&quot;
** Oriental pratincole &quot;Glareola maldivarum&quot;
** Black-winged pratincole &quot;Glareola nordmanni&quot;
** Madagascar pratincole &quot;Glareola ocularis&quot;
** Rock pratincole &quot;Glareola nuchalis&quot;
** Grey pratincole &quot;Glareola cinerea&quot;
** Small pratincole &quot;Glareola lactea&quot;

<text>Amber Benson (born January 8, 1977) is an American actress, writer, director, and producer. She is best known for her role as Tara Maclay on the TV series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1999–2002), and has directed, produced and starred in her own films &quot;Chance&quot; (2002) and &quot;Lovers, Liars &amp; Lunatics&quot; (2006).

Benson was born January 8, 1977, in Birmingham, Alabama, the daughter of Diane and Edward Benson, a psychiatrist. She has a younger sister, Danielle, who is an artist. Her father is Jewish and her mother was raised Southern Baptist; Benson grew up attending a Reform synagogue in Alabama.

==Career==

Benson was 14 when she made her feature film debut in the Steven Soderbergh film &quot;King of the Hill&quot;.

Benson is best known for her recurring role as Tara Maclay on the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. The character first appeared in the season 4 episode &quot;Hush&quot; and soon became the girlfriend of Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan). Benson remained with the series until season 6 when her character was killed off. In her final episode, Benson was credited for the only time as a regular cast member.

Benson sang in the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; musical episode &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot;. She provided vocals for the songs &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Theory/ Bunnies/If We&#x27;re Together&quot;, &quot;Under Your Spell&quot; (her solo), &quot;Walk Through the Fire&quot;, &quot;Standing/Under Your Spell (Reprise)&quot;, and &quot;Where Do We Go from Here?&quot; In 2002, she performed two songs on Buffy colleague Anthony Stewart Head&#x27;s album &quot;Music for Elevators&quot;.

While still working on &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, Benson co-wrote the movie &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; with director Gabriel Bologna, released in 2001, and directed, produced, edited, and acted in a digital video feature called &quot;Chance&quot; (2002) which also featured her &quot;Buffy&quot; co-star James Marsters. She also collaborated with director James Kerwin in 2003 to produce her play &quot;Albert Hall&quot; in Hollywood.

In 2001, Benson worked with Golden, Terry Moore, and Eric Powell of Dark Horse Comics to create the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Willow and Tara&quot; comic book titled &quot;WannaBlessedBe&quot;. The following year (2002), she worked with Christopher Golden and AJ (Ajit Jothikaumar) of Dark Horse Comics to create the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Willow and Tara&quot; comic books titled &quot;Wilderness #1&quot; and &quot;Wilderness #2&quot;.

Benson and Christopher Golden produced and began a series of animated fantasy films for the BBC with the animation studio Cosgrove Hall. &quot;Ghosts of Albion: Legacy&quot; (2003) and its sequels are available on the BBC Cult website. Benson and Golden have also collaborated on two supernatural thrillers: &quot;Ghosts of Albion: Accursed&quot; and &quot;Ghosts of Albion: Witchery&quot;. These books follow the fortunes of Tamara and William Swift, who first appeared in the BBC animated web movie &quot;Ghosts of Albion: Legacy&quot;.

In 2003, she had a supporting role in &quot;Latter Days&quot; as Traci Levine, alongside Steve Sandvoss and Wes Ramsey.

In 2005, Benson collaborated with artist Jamie McKelvie on a short story within the Image Comics collection &quot;Four Letter Worlds&quot;. In 2006, Benson collaborated with artist Ben Templesmith on &quot;Demon Father John&#x27;s Pinwheel Blues&quot; published by IDW as a four-part split-book, &quot;Shadowplay&quot; (with work by Ashley Wood and Christina Z.
In 2006, Benson released her second independent feature film &quot;Lovers, Liars &amp; Lunatics&quot; through her own production company, Benson Entertainment. The film was shot on film and was partly financed by the sale of limited edition &quot;Triangle&quot; Tara Buffyverse action figure. The project, initially called &quot;The Dirty Script,&quot; was ultimately titled &quot;Lovers, Liars and Lunatics&quot; by producer Diane Benson, Amber&#x27;s mother.

In 2006, Benson also portrayed the &quot;vegetarian&quot; vampiress Lenore on the TV series &quot;Supernatural&quot;.

In December 2006, Benson and Golden released yet another collaboration, the short novel &quot;The Seven Whistlers&quot; which is distributed through Subterranean Press in a limited number of signed copies. In September 2007, Benson signed a three-book deal with Ginjer Buchanan of Penguin Books. &quot;Death&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, was released by Ace Books on February 24, 2009; &quot;Cat&#x27;s Claw&quot;, on February 23, 2010; and &quot;Serpent&#x27;s Storm&quot;, in February 2011. On February 28, 2012, the fourth book in the series, &quot;How to Be Death&quot; was released.

Benson is the co-director with Adam Busch of the 2010 comedy film &quot;Drones&quot;.

In 2012, Benson played a young Judith Collins in the &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; audio drama &quot;Dress Me in Dark Dreams&quot;. She guest starred in the second season of the Jane Espenson scripted romantic comedy web series, &quot;Husbands&quot;.

In June 2013, it was announced that Benson has been attached to star in the web TV series adaptation of &quot;The Morganville Vampires&quot; as Amelie, the founder of Morganville.

Benson narrated the 2014 audiobook &quot;Lock In&quot; by John Scalzi. In October 2014, she published her fantasy book &quot;The Witches of Echo Park&quot;.

The Audible exclusive, written with Christopher Golden, was released in October 2023.

==Activism==
During the 2008 campaign season, Benson was featured in a Barack Obama advertisement sponsored by MoveOn.org.

In February 2021, Benson spoke out in support of &quot;Buffy The Vampire Slayer&quot; co-star Charisma Carpenter&#x27;s accusation of unprofessional and abusive behavior on the part of &quot;Buffy&quot; creator Joss Whedon, corroborating Carpenter&#x27;s account by relating that the set of that series was a &quot;toxic environment&quot; whose traumatic effects upon those who worked there were long-lasting.

==Personal life==

As of 2007, Benson resided in Los Angeles. She described herself as a &quot;lapsed vegetarian&quot;.

From 2002 to 2009, she dated Adam Busch, who played Warren Mears on &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer.&quot; The two have remained close friends.

<text>The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT; ) is the &quot;de facto&quot; embassy of the United States of America in Taiwan. AIT is a wholly owned subsidiary of the federal government of the United States in Taiwan with Congressional oversight. The AIT was officially created as a U.S. government-sponsored nonprofit, private corporation established under the auspices of the U.S. government to serve its interests in Taiwan.

Primarily staffed by employees of the United States Department of State and local workers, the AIT provides consular services normally offered by United States diplomatic missions, with the Great Seal of the State Department hung at the main office in Taipei. The establishment of diplomatic relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) in 1979 required the United States to develop its own &quot;One China policy&quot; and subsequently to terminate official diplomatic relations with the Republic of China (Taiwan). The AIT now serves to assist and protect U.S. interests in Taiwan in a quasiofficial manner, and also processes U.S. visas and provides consular services to U.S. expatriates. Following the swift passage of the 2018 Taiwan Travel Act by the United States, it now serves as a high-level representative bureau on behalf of United States in Taiwan. It receives full protection from the United States Marine Corps as do all U.S. embassies.

==Overview==
AIT is a nonprofit corporation established pursuant to the Taiwan Relations Act to manage America&#x27;s unofficial relationship with Taiwan; it was incorporated in the District of Columbia on 16 January 1979 after the U.S. established full diplomatic relations with the PRC on January 1, 1979. This model, with an alternative form of American representative office established in Taiwan after the diplomatic relations were severed, was based on the AIT&#x27;s Japanese counterpart stationed in Taipei since 1972, and was therefore referred to as the .

Following the authorization of the Taiwan Relations Act, the Department of State, through a semiofficial contract with AIT, provides guidance and &quot;funds a large part of AIT’s operations.&quot; Like other U.S. missions abroad, AIT is staffed by employees of the Department of State and other agencies of the United States, as well as by locally hired staff. Prior to a 2002 amendment to the Foreign Service Act (Section 503 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, as amended by the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003), United States government employees were required to resign from government service for their period of assignment to AIT. According to Section 12 (a) of the Taiwan Relations Act, agreements conducted by AIT have to be reported to Congress, just as other international agreements concluded by United States and governments with which it has diplomatic relations. Thus, while relations between the U.S. and Taiwan through AIT are conducted on an informal basis, the U.S. government still treats the relationship within the same confines as with other states with formal diplomatic relations.

AIT has a small headquarters office in Arlington County, Virginia with its largest office located in Taipei, Taiwan. The organization also has a branch office in Taiwan&#x27;s strategic southern port city of Kaohsiung. These three bureaus are referred to as AIT/Washington (AIT/W), AIT/Taipei (AIT/T) and AIT/Kaohsiung (AIT/K), respectively.

The AIT office complex at No. 100 Jin Hu Road, Neihu District, Taipei, was inaugurated in 2019. AIT/Taipei was previously located in the Daan District on the former site of the U.S. Military Advisory Group headquarters before 1979. AIT has a branch office in Kaohsiung.

For the purposes of remuneration and benefits, directors of the AIT hold the same rank as ambassador and, in Taiwan, are accorded diplomatic privileges in their capacity as directors.

Its counterpart in the United States is the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office.

In May 2024, Raymond Greene was announced as the incoming AIT director, effective summer 2024, succeeding Sandra Oudkirk. During Greene&#x27;s first meeting with Taiwan President Lai Ching-te, he said the United States&#x27; longstanding policy on Taiwan is based on the &quot;one China policy&quot;, which acknowledges that Taiwan is a part of China, and that there is only one China. In a press release describing the meeting, Lai&#x27;s office omitted the one China reference, and instead described Greene&#x27;s remarks as having referenced &quot;the longstanding U.S. policy.&quot; Lai&#x27;s office denied it intentionally omitted the reference to the one China policy, which was challenged by local Taiwanese media.

==New compound in Taipei ==

A new $250 million compound for the American Institute in Taiwan was unveiled in June 2018, accompanied by a &quot;low-key&quot; U.S. delegation and several mid-level diplomats. According to the AIT the new complex represents &quot;the United States&#x27; brick-and-mortar commitment to Taiwan.&quot;

In 2019 director Christensen buried a time capsule at the new AIT complex in Neihu. The time capsule is not to be unearthed for 50 years.

== Protests ==
Several protests have been staged outside AIT&#x27;s office.

Protests were staged by Taiwanese outside AIT&#x27;s then office in response to then US President Bill Clinton&#x27;s meeting with Jiang Zemin in 1998. 

Three Taiwanese firms protested AIT&#x27;s failure to pay fees owed for contracting work on the office&#x27;s new premises in 2013, then under construction.

In May, 2024, protestors gathered outside AIT to protest the United States&#x27; participation in the destruction of Gaza and killing of its citizens. Protestors said the United States was complicit in genocide.

<doc id="220255" wikidata="Q267907" url="?curid=220255" title="Hypersexuality">
<text>Hypersexuality is a proposed medical condition said to cause unwanted or excessive sexual arousal, causing people to engage in or think about sexual activity to a point of distress or impairment. It is controversial whether it should be included as a clinical diagnosis used by mental healthcare professionals. [[Nymph|Nymphomaniac]] and [[Satyr|satyriasis]] were terms previously used for the condition in women and men, respectively.

Hypersexuality may be a primary condition, or the symptom of other medical conditions or disorders such as Klüver–Bucy syndrome, bipolar disorder, brain injury and dementia. Hypersexuality may also present as a side effect of medication, such as dopaminergic drugs used to treat Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Frontal lesions caused by brain injury, strokes, and frontal lobotomy are thought to cause hypersexuality in individuals who have had these conditions. Clinicians have yet to reach a consensus over how best to describe hypersexuality as a primary condition, or to determine the appropriateness of describing such behaviors and impulses as a separate pathology.

Hypersexual behaviors are viewed variously by clinicians and therapists as a type of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or &quot;OCD-spectrum disorder&quot;, an addiction, or a disorder of impulsivity. A number of authors do not acknowledge such a pathology, and instead assert that the condition merely reflects a cultural dislike of exceptional sexual behavior.

Consistent with there not being any consensus over what causes hypersexuality, authors have used many different labels to refer to it, sometimes interchangeably, but often depending on which theory they favor or which specific behavior they have studied or have done research on; related or obsolete terms include compulsive masturbation, compulsive sexual behavior, cybersex addiction, erotomania, &quot;excessive sexual drive&quot;, hyperphilia, hypersexuality, hypersexual disorder, problematic hypersexuality, sexual addiction, sexual compulsivity, sexual dependency, sexual impulsivity, &quot;out of control sexual behavior&quot;, and paraphilia-related disorder.

Due to the controversy surrounding the diagnosis of hypersexuality, there is no one generally accepted definition and measurement for hypersexuality, making it difficult to truly determine the prevalence. Thus, the prevalence can vary depending on how it is defined and measured. Overall, hypersexuality is estimated to affect 2–6% of the population, and may be higher in certain populations like men, those who have been traumatized, and sex offenders.

==Causes==
There is little consensus among experts as to the causes of hypersexuality. Some research suggests that some cases can be linked to biochemical or physiological changes that accompany dementia, as dementia can lead to disinhibition. Psychological needs also complicate the biological explanation, which identifies the temporal/frontal lobe of the brain as the area for regulating libido. Injuries to this part of the brain increase the risk of aggressive behavior and other behavioral problems including personality changes and &quot;socially inappropriate&quot; sexual behavior such as hypersexuality or pedophilia. The same symptom can occur after unilateral temporal lobotomy. There are other biological factors that are associated with hypersexuality such as premenstrual changes, and the exposure to virilising hormones in childhood or in utero.

=== Physiology ===
In research involving the use of antiandrogens to reduce undesirable sexual behaviour such as hypersexuality, testosterone has been found to be necessary, but not sufficient, for sexual drive. A lack of physical closeness and forgetfulness of the recent past were proposed as other potential factors (specifically in the context of hypersexual behavior exhibited by people suffering from dementia).

Pathogenic overactivity of the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway in the brain—forming either psychiatrically, during mania, or pharmacologically, as a side effect of dopamine agonists, specifically D3-preferring agonists—is associated with various addictions and has been shown to result among some in overindulgent, sometimes hypersexual, behavior. HPA axis dysregulation has been associated with hypersexual disorder.

The American Association for Sex Addiction Therapy acknowledges biological factors as contributing causes of sex addiction. Other associated factors include psychological components (which affect mood and motivation as well as psychomotor and cognitive functions), spiritual control, mood disorders, sexual trauma, and intimacy anorexia as causes or type of sex addiction.

==As a symptom==
Hypersexuality is known to present itself as a symptom in connection to a number of mental and neurological disorders. Some people with borderline personality disorder (sometimes referred to as BPD) can be markedly impulsive, seductive, and extremely sexual. Sexual promiscuity, sexual obsessions, and hypersexuality are very common symptoms for both men and women with BPD. On occasion for some there can be extreme forms of paraphilic drives and desires. &quot;Borderline&quot; patients, due in the opinion of some to the use of splitting, experience love and sexuality in unstable ways.

People with bipolar disorder may often display tremendous swings in sex drive depending on their mood. As defined in the DSM-IV-TR, hypersexuality can be a symptom of hypomania or mania in bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder. Pick&#x27;s disease causes damage to the temporal/frontal lobe of the brain; people with Pick&#x27;s disease show a range of socially inappropriate behaviors.

Several neurological conditions such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, autism, various types of brain injury, Klüver–Bucy syndrome, Kleine–Levin syndrome, Epilepsy and many neurodegenerative diseases can cause hypersexual behavior. Sexually inappropriate behavior has been shown to occur in 7–8% of Alzheimer&#x27;s patients living at home, at a care facility or in a hospital setting. Hypersexuality has also been reported to result as a side-effect of some medications used to treat Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Some recreationally used drugs, such as methamphetamine, may also contribute to hypersexual behavior.

A positive link between the severity of dementia and occurrence of inappropriate behavior has also been found. Hypersexuality can be caused by dementia in a number of ways, including disinhibition due to organic disease, misreading of social cues, understimulation, the persistence of learned sexual behavior after other behaviours have been lost, and the side-effects of the drugs used to treat dementia. Other possible causes of dementia-related hypersexuality include an inappropriately expressed psychological need for intimacy and forgetfulness of the recent past. As this illness progresses, increasing hypersexuality has been theorized to sometimes compensate for declining self-esteem and cognitive function.

Symptoms of hypersexuality are also similar to those of sexual addiction in that they embody similar traits. These symptoms include the inability to be intimate (intimacy anorexia), depression and bipolar disorders. The resulting hypersexuality may have an impact in the person&#x27;s social and occupational domains if the underlying symptoms have a large enough systemic influence.

==As a disorder==

In 2010, a proposal to add &quot;Sexual Addiction&quot; to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) system has failed to get support of the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The DSM does include an entry called Sexual Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (Sexual Disorder NOS) to apply to, among other conditions, &quot;distress about a pattern of repeated sexual relationships involving a succession of lovers who are experienced by the individual only as things to be used&quot;. the DSM-5-TR, does not recognize a diagnosis of sexual addiction.

The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) of the World Health Organization (WHO), includes two relevant entries. One is &quot;Excessive Sexual Drive&quot; (coded F52.7), which is divided into satyriasis for males and nymphomania for females. The other is &quot;Excessive Masturbation&quot; or &quot;Onanism (excessive)&quot; (coded F98.8).

In 1988, Levine and Troiden questioned whether it makes sense to discuss hypersexuality at all, arguing that labeling sexual urges &quot;extreme&quot; merely stigmatizes people who do not conform to the norms of their culture or peer group, and that sexual compulsivity be a myth. However, and in contrast to this view, 30 years later in 2018, the ICD-11 created a new condition classification, compulsive sexual behavior, to cover &quot;a persistent pattern of failure to control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges resulting in repetitive sexual behaviour&quot;. It classifies this &quot;failure to control&quot; as an abnormal mental health condition.

== Risks ==
Individuals with hypersexuality are at a higher risk for various negative consequences, such as contracting STIs, committing sexual abuse, damaging relationships, and developing other addictions. 27.5% of affected individuals contracted an STI on at least one occasion as a result of their hypersexual behavior, and 12% of affected individuals engage in excessive, unprotected sex with multiple anonymous partners. Additionally, an overwhelming 89% affected individuals admit to engaging in sexual activities outside of their primary relationship. This can negatively affect one&#x27;s interpersonal and sexual relationships. In fact, 22.8% of sex addicts have had a relationship end due to their behaviors. 

Furthermore, those with hypersexuality are more likely to have had or acquire another addiction. Multiple addictions are also prevalent amongst affected individuals. Common co-occurring disorders and addictions hypersexual individuals include eating disorders, compulsive spending, chemical dependency, and uncontrollable gambling.

== Assessment ==
Those seeking treatment for hypersexual behavior are a heterogeneous group, thus a thorough assessment is required to evaluate what kinds of behaviors and conditions need to be addressed and treated. It is essential for clinicians to conduct a comprehensive clinical interview with the patient, in which they address the history of their presenting problems, psychological history, sexual history, psychiatric history, mental health history, substance use history, and medical history. Understanding these facets of an individual exhibiting hypersexual behavior is crucial due to the diverse array of comorbid conditions potentially linked to hypersexuality. The presence of ongoing treatment for any coexisting conditions in the individual can also have an impact on their symptoms and subsequent therapeutic interventions. Supplemental information from a spouse or family member could also be used during assessments.

In addition to this, various questionnaires and instruments may be used to further assess various aspects of an individual&#x27;s behaviors and symptoms. Some common questionnaires that are used in assessments are the Sexual Inhibition/Sexual Excitation Scale, Intensity of Sexual Desire and Symptoms Scale, Compulsive Sexual Behavior Inventory, Sexual Compulsivity Scale, and the Sexual Addiction Screening Test amongst others. Different instruments can also be used in assessments, including but not limited to the Clinical Global Impression Scale, Timeline Followback, Minnesota Multiphase Personality Inventory II, and the Millon Inventory.

==Treatment==
The first step to treat hypersexual behavior is to help the individual stop or control their urges. There are a multitude of different treatment options for those experiencing hypersexual behaviors, and many clinicians recommend a multifaceted approach. Treatment plans are created after assessing the individual, so treatment methods can vary depending on an individual&#x27;s history, current symptoms, and any comorbid conditions they may have. Common treatment methods include cognitive-behavioral therapy, relapse-prevention therapy, psychodynamic psychosocial therapy, and psychopharmacological treatment, which can be implemented through individual therapy, couple&#x27;s therapy, and/or group therapy. 

The concept of hypersexuality as an addiction was started in the 1970s by former members of Alcoholics Anonymous who felt they experienced a similar lack of control and compulsivity with sexual behaviors as with alcohol. Multiple 12-step style self-help groups now exist for people who identify as sex addicts, including Sex Addicts Anonymous, Sexaholics Anonymous, Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous, and Sexual Compulsives Anonymous. Some hypersexual men may treat their condition with the usage of medication (such as Cyproterone acetate) or consuming foods considered to be anaphrodisiacs. Other hypersexuals may choose a route of consultation, such as psychotherapy, self-help groups or counselling.

==Terminology==
Sexologists have been using the term &quot;hypersexuality&quot; since the late 1800s, when Krafft-Ebing described several cases of extreme sexual behaviours in his seminal 1886 book, &quot;Psychopathia Sexualis.&quot; The author used the term &quot;hypersexuality&quot; to describe conditions that would now be termed premature ejaculation. Terms to describe males with the condition include &quot;donjuanist&quot;, &quot;satyromaniac&quot;, &quot;satyriac&quot; and &quot;satyriasist&quot;, for women &quot;clitoromaniac&quot;, &quot;nympho&quot; and &quot;nymphomaniac&quot;, for teleiophilic (attracted to adults) heterosexual women &quot;andromaniac&quot;, while &quot;hypersexualist&quot;, &quot;sexaholic&quot;, &quot;onanist&quot;, &quot;hyperphiliac&quot; and &quot;erotomaniac&quot; are gender neutral terms.

Other, mostly historical, names are the Messalina complex, sexaholism, hyperlibido and furor uterinus. John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester described hypersexuality in some of his literature.

<text>Valarie McDermid (born 4 June 1955) is a Scottish crime writer, best known for a series of novels featuring clinical psychologist Dr. Tony Hill and his collaborators in the police department. Her work is considered to be part of a sub-genre known as Tartan Noir. This series was adapted for television, running from 2002 to 2008, and known as &quot;Wire in the Blood.&quot; 

She also had a second series, known as &quot;Karen Pirie&quot;, adapted from her several books featuring that character.

==Biography==
McDermid comes from a working-class family in Fife. She studied English at St Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford, where she was the first student to be admitted from a Scottish state school.

After graduation, she became a journalist and began her literary career as a dramatist. Her first success as a novelist, &quot;Report for Murder: The First Lindsay Gordon Mystery&quot;, was published in 1987.

McDermid was inducted into the prestigious Detection Club in 2000. In 2010 she won the CWA Diamond Dagger for her lifetime contribution to crime writing in the English language. She was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Sunderland in 2011. 

She is co-founder of the Harrogate Crime Writing Festival and the Theakston&#x27;s Old Peculier Crime Novel of the Year Award, part of the Harrogate International Festivals. In 2016 she captained a team of St Hilda&#x27;s alumnæ to win the &quot;Christmas University Challenge&quot;. 

In 2017, McDermid was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, as well as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.

==Work==
McDermid&#x27;s works fall into five series:
* Lindsay Gordon (journalist)
* Kate Brannigan (private investigator)
* Tony Hill (clinical psychologist) and DCI Carol Jordan
* DCI Karen Pirie
* Allie Burns (investigative reporter)

&quot;The Mermaids Singing&quot;, the first book in the Hill/Jordan series by Val McDermid, won the Crime Writers&#x27; Association Gold Dagger for Best Crime Novel of the Year. The Hill/Jordan series has been adapted for television under the name &quot;Wire in the Blood&quot;, starring Robson Green and running from 2002 to 2008. Another series was adapted from Val McDermid&#x27;s books featuring Karen Pirie; the series is named &quot;Karen Pirie.&quot;

McDermid has said that her character of Jacko Vance, a TV celebrity with a secret lust for torture, murder and under-age girls, who she featured in &quot;Wire in the Blood&quot; and two later books, is based on her direct personal experience of interviewing Jimmy Savile. 

In addition to writing novels, McDermid contributes to several British newspapers and often broadcasts on BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio Scotland. Her novels, in particular the Tony Hill series, are known for their graphic depictions of violence and torture.

In 2010, McDermid received the Cartier Diamond Dagger from the Crime Writers&#x27; Association for &quot;outstanding achievement in the field of crime writing&quot;.

McDermid considers her work to be part of the &quot;Tartan Noir&quot; Scottish crime fiction genre.

In August 2022 McDermid reported that the estate of Agatha Christie had threatened her publishers with legal action if they referred to McDermid as &quot;the Queen of Crime&quot;. They said that the term was copyrighted by the Christie estate.

==Raith Rovers==
McDermid was a lifelong fan of Raith Rovers football club, her father having worked as a scout for the club. In 2010, she sponsored the McDermid Stand at Stark&#x27;s Park, the club&#x27;s ground in Kirkcaldy, in honour of her father.

A year after sponsoring the stand, she became a board member of the club, and starting in 2014 her website became Raith&#x27;s shirt sponsor.

In February 2022, McDermid said she would be withdrawing her support and sponsorship from Raith Rovers after the club signed striker David Goodwillie, who had been ruled to have raped a woman and made to pay damages in a civil case in 2017. Following the signing of Goodwillie, Raith Rovers women&#x27;s team severed ties with the main club and renamed themselves McDermid Ladies, after the writer. McDermid moved her sponsorship to the new ladies&#x27; team.

==Ink attack==
On 6 December 2012 a woman poured ink over McDermid during an event at the University of Sunderland. McDermid was signing books, and a woman asked her to autograph a &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; annual which contained a picture of the disgraced late TV presenter Jimmy Savile. After McDermid reluctantly agreed the woman threw ink at her and ran out of the room. McDermid said the incident would not stop her from doing signings.

Northumbria Police arrested Sandra Botham, a 64-year-old woman from the Hendon area of Sunderland, on suspicion of assault. Botham was convicted of common assault on 10 July 2013, received a 12-month community order with supervision and was made to pay £50 compensation and a £60 victim surcharge. She was also given a restraining order forbidding her from contacting McDermid for an undefined period of time. &quot;The Northern Echo&quot; reported that Botham&#x27;s actions were motivated by McDermid&#x27;s 1994 non-fiction book &quot;A Suitable Job for a Woman&quot;, as Botham said the book contained a passage that besmirched her and her family.

==Personal life==
McDermid formerly lived in both Stockport and near Alnmouth in Northumberland with three cats and a border terrier dog. Since early 2014 she has lived in Stockport and Edinburgh.

In 2016, McDermid captained a team of crime writer challengers on the TV quiz &quot;Eggheads&quot;, beating the Eggheads and winning £14,000.

In 2010, she was living between Northumberland and Manchester with publisher Kelly Smith, with whom she had entered into a civil partnership in 2006.

On 23 October 2016 McDermid married her partner of two years, Jo Sharp, a Professor of Geography at the University of Glasgow.

McDermid is a radical feminist and socialist. She has incorporated feminism into some of her novels.

<doc id="220266" wikidata="Q894235" url="?curid=220266" title="Fan-tailed raven">
<text>The fan-tailed raven (Corvus rhipidurus) is a passerine bird of the crow family native to Eastern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.

==Description==
The fan-tailed raven is completely black including bill, legs and feet and the plumage has a purplish-blue gloss in good light. Worn plumage is slightly coppery-brown. The base of the feathers on the upper neck are white and only seen if the bird is inspected or a strong gust blows them the wrong way. The throat hackles are shorter than in most other ravens. One of the smaller raven species, it is about the same size or slightly larger than the carrion crow, at 47–51 cm, but with a much thicker bill, shorter tail and much larger wings.

The voice is described as guttural croaks mixed with the sound of frog-call. Like all corvids, the fan-tailed raven is capable of vocal mimicry; however, this behavior is mostly recorded in captivity and, very rarely, in the wild.

==Distribution and habitat==
It occurs in the Middle East, North Africa, Arabia, and south to Sudan and Kenya. It also ranges across the Aïr Massif in the southern Sahara. It lives in desert or open dry country that includes crags for nesting. It is one of the most aerial of birds traveling huge distances in search of food, its large wings being adapted to gliding on thermals in a rather vulture-like way.

==Behaviour==

===Diet===
Food is invariably taken on the ground and includes all manner of insects and other invertebrates, grain taken from animal dung, carrion and scraps of human food. It has also been seen taking skin parasites from camels and, where not persecuted, scavenges around rubbish dumps and camp sites. Fruits of all types are eaten readily. It soars and plays in thermals even more so than other raven species and often associates with the brown-necked raven roosting in the same tree as it.

===Nesting===
This species nests on rock ledges and in cavities in cliffs though very rarely in Somalia it has been known to nest in trees. There are usually 2–4 eggs laid. The great-spotted cuckoo (&quot;Clamator glandarius&quot;) sometimes uses this species as a brood host.

<doc id="220267" wikidata="Q210746" url="?curid=220267" title="Wallace Line">
<text>The Wallace Line or Wallace&#x27;s Line is a faunal boundary line drawn in 1859 by the British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace and named by the English biologist Thomas Henry Huxley.

It separates the biogeographic realms of Asia and &#x27;Wallacea&#x27;, a transitional zone between Asia and Australia formerly also called the Malay Archipelago and the Indo-Australian Archipelago (Present day Indonesia). To the west of the line are found organisms related to Asiatic species; to the east, a mixture of species of Asian and Australian origins is present. Wallace noticed this clear division in both land mammals and birds during his travels through the East Indies in the 19th century.

The line runs through Indonesia, such as Makassar Strait between Borneo and Sulawesi (Celebes), and through the Lombok Strait between Bali and Lombok, where the distance is strikingly small, only about 35 kilometers (22 mi), but enough for a contrast in species present on each island. 

The complex biogeography of the Indo-Australian Archipelago is a result of its location at the merging point of four major tectonic plates and other semi-isolated microplates in combination with ancient sea levels. Those caused the isolation of different taxonomic groups on islands at present relatively close to each other. Wallace&#x27;s Line is one of the many boundaries drawn by naturalists and biologists since the mid-1800s intended to delineate constraints on the distribution of the fauna and flora of the archipelago.

== Historical context ==
One of the earliest descriptions of the biodiversity in the Indo-Australian Archipelago dates back to 1521 when Venetian explorer Pigafetta recorded the biological contrasts between the Philippines and the Maluku Islands (Spice Islands) (on opposite sides of Wallace&#x27;s Line) during the continuation of the voyage of Ferdinand Magellan, after Magellan had been killed on Mactan. Later on, the English navigator G.W. Earl published his observations in faunal differences between the islands in the Indo-Australian archipelago. 

In 1845, G.W. Earl described how shallow seas connected islands on the west (Sumatra, Java, etc.) with the Asian continent and with similar wildlife, and islands on the east such as New Guinea were connected to Australia and were characterized by the presence of marsupials.

These early investigations assisted Wallace in developing his theories about the biogeography which he stated publicly in his 1859 paper after extensively traveling the region. He proposed a line to the east of Bali since &quot;all the islands eastward of Borneo and Java formed part of an Australian or Pacific continent, from which they were separated.&quot;

The proposal of the line, however, was not the main objective of Wallace&#x27;s endeavours: His primary purpose was in fact to understand the geological phenomena and the colonization events that caused the boundaries in faunal distribution in the region through the development of his theories of evolution and biogeography. Wallace&#x27;s studies in Indonesia demonstrated the emerging theory of evolution, at about the same time as J.D. Hooker and Asa Gray published essays also supporting Darwin&#x27;s hypothesis. On the other hand, the lack of knowledge of tectonic plates, and the uncertainty about biodiversity in the Philippines, left Wallace with some contradicting points he had to deal with concerning his theory on biogeography. 

In fact, Wallace did not include the Philippines in his 1859 paper, and the determination of a line in honor of his name was suggested by T.H. Huxley (1868). Huxley studied the distribution of gallinaceous birds in the archipelago, and noticed that species in the Philippines were remarkably distinct from those in the Asiatic realm. Based on that, he redrew Wallace&#x27;s boundary placing it to the west of the Philippines and named it &quot;Wallace&#x27;s Line&quot;, although Wallace himself had refused to include the Philippines on the east side of the line.

Because of the complexity of the geographical landscape and the differences in diversity of organisms around the archipelago, continuous attempts to characterize faunal and botanical boundaries were carried out after Wallace. Some of them are

* Sclater line (1894)
* Lydekker&#x27;s line (1896)
* Pelseneer&#x27;s faunal balance (1904), also known as Weber line
* Mayr&#x27;s faunal balance (1944)

In addition, several smaller transition sub-regional boundaries were also proposed.

More recent work assessing biodiversity assemblages, phylogeny, and using computer-based geospatial tools to analyze previous boundaries have led to patterns of division similar to those proposed through the 19th century, although some special cases not explained before are reinforced by these modern analyses.

 for instance, evaluated the distribution of land mammals, birds, and amphibians in Wallace&#x27;s realms and concluded that the boundaries suggested by Wallace remain valid. Ali &quot;et al&quot;. (2020), in a different attempt, studied the fauna of Christmas Island and indicated that most of the ancestral colonizers of the island&#x27;s land mammals and amphibians disappeared from the Lombok Strait. Therefore, they propose a re-conformation of Wallace&#x27;s Line so that Christmas Island would be sited on the Australasian side of the biogeographical divide, instead of the oriental side.

==Biogeography==
Understanding of the biogeography of the region centers on the relationship of ancient sea levels to the continental shelves. Wallace&#x27;s Line is visible geographically when the continental shelf contours are examined. It figures as a deep-water channel that separates the southeastern edge of the Sunda Shelf from the Sahul Shelf. The Sunda Shelf links Borneo, Bali, Java, and Sumatra underwater to the mainland of southeastern Asia, while the Sahul Shelf connects Australia to New Guinea and their adjacent islands.

During the Pleistocene, when the ocean levels were up to 120 metres (390 ft) lower, islands became connected, but never uniting Asia with Australia. Consequently, for over 50 million years, deep water between those two large continental shelf areas created a barrier that kept the flora and fauna of Australia separated from those of Asia. It can reasonably be concluded it was an ocean barrier preventing species migration because the physical aspects of the separated islands are very similar. Thus, the &quot;Wallacea&quot; region consists of islands that remained isolated on their respective continental land masses, with only those organisms capable of crossing the straits between islands populating them.

Alternatively, &quot;Weber&#x27;s line&quot; runs through this transitional area (to the east of center), at the tipping point between Asian species against those with Australian origins.

== Zoogeography ==
The distributions of many bird species follow the limits of the line, since many birds do not cross even the shortest stretches of open ocean water. Among mammals, bats have distributions that can cross the line, but larger terrestrial mammals are generally limited to one side or the other. On the Australian side, many species of marsupials are present, and some monotremes, alongside native rodents—although the occurrence of rodents in this case is derived from more recent colonization events.

By contrast, to the Asian side, marsupials are excluded, and placental mammals such as apes, cats, elephants, monkeys, rhinoceroses, and other species are found. Exceptions to this include macaques, pigs, and tarsiers on Sulawesi.

Other groups of plants and animals show differing patterns, but the overall pattern is striking and reasonably consistent. Flora do not follow the Wallace Line to the same extent as fauna, since their colonization events differ in their ability to spread across bodies of water. One genus of plants that does not cross the line is the Australasian genus &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;, except for one species, &quot;E. deglupta&quot;, which naturally occurs on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines.

<doc id="220271" wikidata="Q2670080" url="?curid=220271" title="Julius Baker">
<text>Julius Baker (September 23, 1915 – August 6, 2003) was one of the foremost American orchestral flute players. During the course of five decades he concertized with several of America&#x27;s premier orchestral ensembles including the Chicago Symphony and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.

==Background==
Baker was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and at age nine started flute lessons with his Jewish-Russian immigrant father. Later he studied with August Caputo and local flautist Robert Morris. He attended the Eastman School of Music, where he was pupil of Leonardo De Lorenzo, and the Curtis Institute, where he studied with William Kincaid and had classes with Marcel Tabuteau. Upon graduation in 1937, Baker returned to Cleveland to play second flute in the Cleveland Orchestra, conducted by Artur Rodziński, and in the section led by Maurice Sharp. He went on to a distinguished and long tenure as principal flute in the New York Philharmonic.

==Career==

===Teaching, performing===
Julius Baker was well known as a teacher and served as a faculty member at the Juilliard School from 1954, the Curtis Institute of Music from 1980, and Carnegie Mellon University from 1991. He made many recordings with conductors such as Bruno Walter and Leonard Bernstein, and played second flute with the Cleveland Orchestra from 1937 to 1941.

Baker emerged as principal flautist with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra under Fritz Reiner from 1941 to 1943, the CBS Symphony Orchestra under Alfredo Antonini at the CBS network in New York City (1943-1951), with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under Rafael Kubelik from 1951 to 1953, and subsequently with the New York Philharmonic for 18 years, beginning in 1965 under such legendary conductors as: Leonard Bernstein, Pierre Boulez and Zubin Mehta. During that time he also played in the Columbia Symphony Orchestra. In 1963, he was a soloist with the Naumburg Orchestral Concerts, in the Naumburg Bandshell, Central Park, in the summer series. 

Baker loved chamber music and was one of the founding members of the Bach Aria Group, with whom he played from 1946 to 1964. Baker also performed on several notable film scores, including &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;Lovesick&quot;. In addition, he appeared opposite violinist Oscar Shumsky in filming Bach&#x27;s Brandenburg Concerto No. 5, with pianist and conductor Glenn Gould for CBC Television. Baker also collaborated with Glenn Gould, the violinist Rafael Druian and members of the New York Philharmonic in a recording of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s Brandenberg Concerto No. 4 in G Major, BWV 1049.
In addition to film, Baker was also featured on network television in such noted programs as: &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; in 1971 and the Public Broadcasting Service series &quot;Great Performances&quot; in 1995.

Baker gave the first American performance with orchestra of the &quot;Ibert Flute Concerto&quot; in 1948 with the CBS Symphony under the direction of Alfredo Antonini for Voice of America, and that concert was later issued on his own label, Oxford Records. Baker also collaborated with his friend John Serry, Sr. during his tenure at CBS and produced a demonstration recording in 1951 of Mr. Serry&#x27;s compositions for flute and accordion entitled &quot;La Culebra&quot; and &quot;Desert Rumba&quot;, both of which were dedicated to Baker.

Baker retired from the New York Philharmonic in 1983 in order to devote himself to playing recitals programs and concertos around the United States, Europe and Asia.

In 1997 and 1999 he was jury member at the International Flute Competition &quot;Leonardo De Lorenzo&quot;, held every two years in Viggiano, Italy.
===The Oxford Recording Company===
Baker was also an electronics buff and amateur ham radio operator. He built audio equipment upon which he taped his early solo recordings. The &quot;Flute Talk&quot; article explained, &quot;His interest in electronics developed into The Oxford Recording Company, a mail-order business he ran out of his home and which produced five of his flute recordings between 1946 and 1951.

<text>Mrs Dalloway is a novel by Virginia Woolf published on 14 May 1925. It details a day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, a fictional upper-class woman in post-First World War England. 

The working title of &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; was &quot;The Hours&quot;. The novel originated from two short stories, &quot;Mrs Dalloway in Bond Street&quot; and the unfinished &quot;The Prime Minister&quot;. In autumn 1922, Woolf began to think of the &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; short story as the first chapter of her new novel, and she completed the manuscript in late autumn 1924.

The book describes Clarissa&#x27;s preparations for a party she will host in the evening and the ensuing party. With an interior perspective, the story travels forwards and backwards in time to construct an image of Clarissa&#x27;s life and the inter-war social structure. The novel addresses the nature of time in personal experience through multiple interwoven stories.

In October 2005, &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; was included on &quot;TIME Magazine&quot;″s list of the 100 best English-language novels written since its first issue in 1923.

On January 1, 2021, &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; entered the public domain in the United States.

==Plot summary==
Clarissa Dalloway goes around London in the morning, getting ready to host a party that evening. The nice day reminds her of her youth spent in the countryside in Bourton and makes her wonder about her choice of husband; she had married the reliable, successful, Richard Dalloway instead of the enigmatic and demanding Peter Walsh, and she &quot;had not the option&quot; to be with a female romantic interest, Sally Seton. Peter reintroduces these conflicts by paying a visit that morning. Peter&#x27;s visit made it clear that he was still in love with Clarissa (despite mention of his new love interest, Daisy), and Clarissa expressed her desire for Peter to take her away. Clarissa additionally invites Peter to her party that evening. 

Septimus Warren Smith, a First World War veteran suffering from deferred traumatic stress, spends his day in the park with his Italian-born wife Lucrezia, who experiences major loneliness as a result of her husband&#x27;s isolating illness. His going to war affected not only his ability to function, but Lucrezia&#x27;s as well. Septimus is now visited by frequent and indecipherable hallucinations, mostly concerning his dear friend Evans, whom he had unresolved unrequited sexual feelings towards, and who died in the war; otherwise Septimus seems to be unable to feel emotions for anyone, even his wife. Septimus&#x27;s relationship with his physicians, Sir William Bradshaw and Dr Holmes, is extremely poor. He fears for his safety in the presence of both doctors and often questions human nature after their interactions. As a result of his involuntary commitment to a psychiatric hospital he takes his own life by jumping out of a window.

Clarissa&#x27;s party in the evening is a slow success. It is attended by most of the characters she has met throughout the book, including Sally, Peter and others from her past. Clarissa discovers that Sally, whom she has not seen for several decades, and who used to be a free-spirited tomboy, has become a respectable, matronly mother to five boys. 

The novel ends with Clarissa hearing about Septimus&#x27;s suicide at the party and gradually coming to admire this stranger&#x27;s act, which she considers an effort to preserve the purity of his happiness. Clarissa also acknowledges her ability to relate to Septimus regardless of her limited knowledge of him.

==Characters==
;Sir William Bradshaw
:A famous psychiatrist to whom Septimus&#x27; physician, Dr. Holmes, refers Septimus. Bradshaw notes that Septimus has had a complete nervous breakdown and suggests spending time in the country as a cure.
;Clarissa Dalloway
:The 51-year-old protagonist of the novel. She is Richard&#x27;s wife and Elizabeth&#x27;s mother, and, while reminiscing about her past, spends the day organising a party that will be held that night. She is self-conscious about her role in London&#x27;s high society. The character was based on Kitty Lushington.
;Elizabeth Dalloway
:Clarissa and Richard&#x27;s 17-year-old daughter. She is said to look &quot;oriental&quot; and has great composure. Compared to her mother, she takes great pleasure in politics and modern history, hoping to be either a doctor or farmer in the future. She would rather spend time in the country with her father than attend her mother&#x27;s party. 
;Richard Dalloway
:Clarissa&#x27;s practical, &quot;simple&quot; husband, who feels disconnected from his wife. He is immersed in his work in government.
;Miss Kilman
:Miss Doris Kilman, originally &quot;Kiehlman&quot;, is Elizabeth&#x27;s schoolmistress for history and is a born-again Christian. She has a degree in history and during the Great War was dismissed from her teaching job because &quot;Miss Dolby thought she would be happier with people who shared her views about the Germans&quot;. She has a German ancestry and wears an unattractive mackintosh coat because she is uninterested in dressing to please others. She dislikes Clarissa intensely but loves to spend time with Elizabeth.
;Sally Seton
:A love interest of Clarissa&#x27;s, with whom she shared a kiss, who is now married to Lord Rosseter and has five boys. Sally had a strained relationship with her family and spent substantial time with Clarissa&#x27;s family in her youth. She once could be described as feisty, as well as a youthful ragamuffin, although she has become more conventional with age.
;Lucrezia &quot;Rezia&quot; Warren Smith
:Septimus&#x27; Italian wife. She is burdened by his mental illness and believes she is judged because of it. During most of the novel, she is homesick for her family and country, which she left to marry Septimus after the Armistice.
;Septimus Warren Smith
:A World War I veteran who suffers from &quot;shell shock&quot; and hallucinations of his deceased friend, Evans. Educated and decorated in the war, he is detached from society and believes himself to be unable to feel. He is married to Lucrezia, from whom he has grown distant.
;Peter Walsh
:An old friend of Clarissa&#x27;s who has failed at most of his ventures in life. In the past, Clarissa rejected his marriage proposal. Now he has returned to England from India and is one of Clarissa&#x27;s party guests. He plans to marry Daisy, a married woman in India, and has returned to try to arrange a divorce from his current wife.
;Hugh Whitbread
:A pompous friend of Clarissa&#x27;s, who holds an unspecified position in the British Royal household. Like Clarissa, he places great importance on his place in society. Although he believes he is an essential member of the British aristocracy, Lady Bruton, Clarissa, Richard, and Peter find him obnoxious.

==Style==
In &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot;, all of the action, aside from the flashbacks, takes place on a day in &quot;the middle of June&quot; of 1923. It is an example of stream of consciousness storytelling: every scene closely tracks the momentary thoughts of a particular character. Woolf blurs the distinction between direct and indirect speech throughout the novel, freely alternating her mode of narration between omniscient description, indirect interior monologue, and soliloquy. The narration follows at least twenty characters in this way, but the bulk of the novel is spent with Clarissa Dalloway, Peter Walsh, and Septimus Smith.

Woolf laid out some of her literary goals with the characters of &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; while still working on the novel. A year before its publication, she gave a talk at Cambridge University called &quot;Character in Fiction&quot;, revised and retitled later that year as &quot;Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown&quot;.

=== Comparisons with Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; ===
&quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; is commonly thought to be a response to James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Both novels use the stream of consciousness technique to follow the thoughts of two characters, one older and one younger, during one day in a bustling city. Woolf herself, writing in 1928, denied any deliberate &quot;method&quot; to the book, saying instead that the structure came about &quot;without any conscious direction&quot;. In her essay &quot;Modern Fiction&quot;, Woolf praised &quot;Ulysses&quot;, writing of the chapter set at the cemetery (&quot;Hades&quot;) that, &quot;on a first reading at any rate, it is difficult not to acclaim a masterpiece&quot;. However, Woolf&#x27;s private writings throughout her first reading of &quot;Ulysses&quot; abound in hostile criticisms, as in this passage: 

&quot;I... have been amused, stimulated, charmed interested by the first 2 or 3 chapters—to the end of the Cemetery scene; &amp; then puzzled, bored, irritated, &amp; disillusioned as by a queasy undergraduate scratching his pimples. And Tom, great Tom, thinks this on a par with &quot;War &amp; Peace&quot;! An illiterate, underbred book it seems to me: the book of a self-taught working man, &amp; we all know how distressing they are, how egotistic, insistent, raw, striking, &amp; ultimately nauseating. When one can have cooked flesh, why have the raw? But I think if you are anaemic, as Tom is, there is glory in blood. Being fairly normal myself I am soon ready for the classics again. I may revise this later. I do not compromise my critical sagacity. I plant a stick in the ground to mark page 200&quot;
: —&quot;D&quot; 2: 188–89

Woolf&#x27;s disdain for Joyce&#x27;s book only solidified after she finished reading it. She summed up her thoughts on the work as a whole:

&quot;I finished &quot;Ulysses&quot;, &amp; think it is a mis-fire. Genius it has I think; but of the inferior water. The book is diffuse. It is brackish. It is pretentious. It is underbred, not only in the obvious sense, but in the literary sense. A first rate writer, I mean, respects writing too much to be tricky; startling; doing stunts. I&#x27;m reminded all the time of some callow board schoolboy, say like Henry Lamb, full of wits &amp; powers, but so self-conscious and egotistical that he loses his head, becomes extravagant, mannered, uproarious, ill at ease, makes kindly people feel sorry for him, &amp; stern ones merely annoyed; &amp; one hopes he&#x27;ll grow out of it; but as Joyce is 40 this scarcely seems likely. I have not read it carefully; &amp; only once; &amp; it is very obscure; so no doubt I have scamped the virtue of it more than is fair. I feel that myriads of tiny bullets pepper one &amp; spatter one; but one does not get one deadly wound straight in the face—as from Tolstoy, for instance; but it is entirely absurd to compare him with Tolstoy.&quot;
: —&quot;D&quot; 2: 199–200.

The Hogarth Press, run by her and her husband Leonard, had to turn down the chance to publish &quot;Ulysses&quot; in 1919 because of the obscenity law in England, as well as the practical issues regarding publishing such a substantial text.

==Themes==
The novel has two main narrative lines involving two separate characters (Clarissa Dalloway and Septimus Smith); within each narrative there is a particular time and place in the past that the main characters keep returning to in their minds. For Clarissa, her charmed youth at Bourton keeps intruding into her thoughts on this day in London. For Septimus, his time as a soldier during the &quot;Great War&quot; keeps intruding, especially in the form of Evans, his fallen comrade. Other characters, such as Peter Walsh, also find themselves returning to moments in their past. 

=== Time and secular living ===

Time plays an integral role in the theme of faith and doubt in Mrs Dalloway. The overwhelming presence of the passing of time and the impending fate of death for each of the characters is felt throughout the novel. As Big Ben towers over the city of London and rings for each half-hour, characters cannot help but stop and notice the loss of life to time in regular intervals throughout the story. For Septimus, who has experienced the vicious war, the notion of death constantly floats in his mind as he continues to see his friend Evans talking of such things. The constant stream of consciousness perspective of the characters, especially Clarissa, serves as a distraction from this passing of time and the ultimate march towards death, but each character is constantly reminded of the inevitability of these facts. Further emphasizing the passage of time is the time-frame of the novel, which takes place in the course of a single day, like Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

The idea that there can be meaning in every detail of life, and a deeper appreciation of life as a result, is emphasized by the constant connection of characters to memories and to simple ideas and things. Clarissa even feels that her job (throwing her parties) is to offer &quot;the gift&quot; of connectedness to the inhabitants of London. Woolf&#x27;s writing style crosses the boundaries of the past, present and future, emphasizing her idea of time as a constant flow, connected only by some force (or divinity) within each person. An evident contrast can be found between the constant passing of time—symbolized by Big Ben—and the seemingly random crossings of time-lines in Woolf&#x27;s writing. Yet, although these crossings seem random, they only demonstrate the infinite possibilities that the world can offer once it is interconnected by the individual character of each person.

===Mental illness===
Septimus, as the shell-shocked war hero, operates as a pointed criticism of the treatment of mental illness and depression. Woolf criticises medical discourse through Septimus&#x27; decline and suicide; his doctors make snap judgments about his condition, talk to him mainly through his wife, and dismiss his urgent confessions before he can make them. Rezia remarks that Septimus &quot;was not ill. Dr Holmes said there was nothing the matter with him.&quot;

Woolf goes beyond commenting on the treatment of mental illness. Using the characters of Clarissa and Rezia, she makes the argument that people can only interpret Septimus&#x27; shell shock according to their cultural norms. Throughout the course of the novel Clarissa does not meet Septimus. Clarissa&#x27;s reality is vastly different from that of Septimus; his presence in London is unknown to Clarissa until his death becomes the subject of idle chatter at her party. By never having these characters meet, Woolf is suggesting that mental illness can be contained to the individuals who suffer from it without others, who remain unaffected, ever having to witness it. This allows Woolf to weave her criticism of the treatment of the mentally ill with her larger argument, which is the criticism of society&#x27;s class structure. Her use of Septimus as the stereotypically traumatised veteran is her way of showing that there were still reminders of the First World War in London in 1923. These ripples affect Mrs. Dalloway and readers spanning generations. Shell shock, or post traumatic stress disorder, is an important addition to the early 20th century canon of post-war British literature.

There are similarities in Septimus&#x27; condition to Woolf&#x27;s struggles with bipolar disorder. Both hallucinate that birds sing in Greek, and Woolf once attempted to throw herself out of a window as Septimus does. Woolf had also been treated for her condition at various asylums, from which her antipathy towards doctors developed. Woolf committed suicide by drowning, sixteen years after the publication of &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot;.

Woolf&#x27;s original plan for her novel called for Clarissa to kill herself during her party. In this original version, Septimus (whom Woolf called Mrs. Dalloway&#x27;s &quot;double&quot;) did not appear at all.

===Existential issues===
When Peter Walsh sees a girl on the street and stalks her for half an hour, he notes that his relationship to the girl was &quot;made up, as one makes up the better part of life.&quot; By focusing on characters&#x27; thoughts and perceptions, Woolf emphasizes the significance of private thoughts on existential crisis rather than concrete events in a person&#x27;s life. Most of the plot in &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; consists of realizations that the characters subjectively make.

Clarissa Dalloway is depicted as a woman who appreciates life. Her love of party-throwing comes from a desire to bring people together and create happy moments. Her charm, according to Peter Walsh, who loves her, is a sense of &quot;joie de vivre&quot;, always summarized by the sentence: &quot;There she was.&quot; She interprets Septimus Smith&#x27;s death as an act of embracing life and her mood remains light, even though she hears about it in the midst of the party. 

===Feminism===
As a commentary on inter-war society, Clarissa&#x27;s character highlights the role of women as the proverbial &quot;Angel in the House&quot; and embodies sexual and economic repression and the narcissism of bourgeois women who have never known the hunger and insecurity of working women. She keeps up with and even embraces the social expectations of the wife of a patrician politician, but she is still able to express herself and find distinction in the parties she throws.

Her old friend Sally Seton, whom Clarissa admires dearly, is remembered as a great independent woman – she smoked cigars, once ran down a corridor naked to fetch her sponge-bag, and made bold, unladylike statements to get a reaction from people. When Clarissa meets her in the present day, Sally turns out to be a perfect housewife, having accepted her lot as a rich woman (&quot;Yes, I have ten thousand a year&quot;-whether before the tax was paid, or after, she couldn&#x27;t remember...), married, and given birth to five sons.

===Homosexuality===
Clarissa Dalloway felt a strong bond to Sally Seton at Bourton, and those feelings seem to extend beyond friendship. Thirty-four years later, Clarissa still considers the kiss they shared to be the &quot;most exquisite&quot; moment of her life, and she remembers feeling about Sally &quot;as men feel.&quot; Clarissa even goes so far as to compare her feelings to those that Shakespeare&#x27;s character Othello feels for Desdemona—and when she looks back and ponders those emotions, the narration remarks, &quot;But this question of love (she thought, putting her coat away), this falling in love with women. Take Sally Seton; her relation in the old days with Sally Seton. Had not that, after all, been love?&quot; Clarissa then recalls Sally&#x27;s visit and how others seemed &quot;indifferent&quot; to Sally&#x27;s presence, and she thinks to herself, &quot;But nothing is so strange when one is in love (and what was this except being in love?) as the complete indifference of other people.&quot;

Clarissa also recalls Sally&#x27;s visit—specifically the experience of seeing Sally at dinner—as &quot;the most happy&quot; moment of her life. Nevertheless, scholar Kate Haffey observes that some critics have attempted to gloss over the narrative&#x27;s erotic qualities and reframe Clarissa and Sally&#x27;s early relationship as a fanciful yet ultimately platonic phase of heterosexual female development: &quot;Despite the quite sexual nature of Clarissa&#x27;s descriptions of her affections for women, her feelings for Sally are most often constructed as representing a period of girlhood innocence that is sharply contrasted with the adult self […] When this love is not described in terms of its &#x27;innocence,&#x27; it is positioned as part of that &#x27;unruly&#x27; phase of adolescence, a period incompatible with female maturity.&quot; Yet in the novel itself, memories of the kiss are rendered in passionate language (Clarissa compares the kiss to &quot;a diamond, something infinitely precious&quot;), and this moment of the past drifts back powerfully into Clarissa&#x27;s present, creating a sense of timelessness. The kiss thus underlines the novel&#x27;s theme of temporality, as the experience is a moment that seems to stand outside or suspend ordinary time.

Similarly, Septimus is haunted by the image of his dear friend and commanding officer, Evans, who is described as being &quot;undemonstrative in the company of women.&quot; The narrator describes Septimus and Evans behaving together like &quot;two dogs playing on a hearth-rug&quot; who, inseparable, &quot;had to be together, share with each other, fight with each other, quarrel with each other...&quot; Jean E. Kennard notes that the word &quot;share&quot; could easily be read in a Forsteran manner, perhaps as in Forster&#x27;s &quot;Maurice&quot;; &quot;The word &#x27;share&#x27; […] was often used in this period to describe sexual relations between men.&quot; Kennard also notes Septimus&#x27; &quot;increasing revulsion at the idea of heterosexual sex,&quot; abstaining from sex with Rezia and feeling that &quot;the business of copulation was filth to him before the end.&quot;

==Adaptations==

Dutch film director Marleen Gorris made a film version of &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; in 1997. It was adapted from Woolf&#x27;s novel by British actress Eileen Atkins and starred Vanessa Redgrave and Natascha McElhone in the title role. The cast included Lena Headey, Rupert Graves, Michael Kitchen, Alan Cox, Sarah Badel, and Katie Carr.
A related 2002 film, &quot;The Hours&quot; depicts a single day in the lives of three women across generations affected by &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot;: Woolf writing it in 1923, a Los Angeles housewife reading it in 1951, and a New York literary editor living it in 2001. Adapted from the 1998 novel by Michael Cunningham, the cast features Nicole Kidman as Woolf, Julianne Moore as housewife Laura, and Meryl Streep as editor Clarissa. Cunningham titled his novel &quot;The Hours&quot; after Woolf&#x27;s working title for &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot;. A 2022 opera with music by Kevin Puts and libretto by Greg Pierce was based on Cunningham&#x27;s novel and the film.

==Other appearances==
Mrs Dalloway also appears in Virginia Woolf&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Voyage Out&quot;, as well as five of her short stories, in which the character hosts dinner parties to which the main subject of the narrative is invited:

* &quot;The New Dress&quot;: a self-conscious guest has a new dress made for the event
* &quot;The Introduction&quot;: whose main character is Lily Everit
* &quot;Together and Apart&quot;: Mrs Dalloway introduces the main protagonists
* &quot;The Man Who Loved His Kind&quot;: Mrs Dalloway&#x27;s husband, Richard, invites a school friend, who finds the evening uncomfortable in the extreme
* &quot;A Summing Up&quot;: a couple meet in her garden

The stories (except for &quot;The Introduction&quot;) all appear in the 1944 collection &quot;A Haunted House and Other Short Stories&quot;, and in the 1973 collection &quot;Mrs Dalloway&#x27;s Party&quot;.

<doc id="220282" wikidata="Q6483938" url="?curid=220282" title="Land reform in Kerala">
<text>Due to the ancient land relations and taxation and regulation under the British Raj, at the time of independence, India inherited a semi-feudal agrarian system, with ownership of land concentrated in the hands of a few individual landlords. Since independence, there has been voluntary and state initiated/mediated land reforms in several states. The most notable and successful example of land reforms are in the states of West Bengal and Kerala. The Land Reforms Ordinance was a law in the state of Kerala, India by K. R. Gowri Amma minister in the first EMS government.

The EMS government was the first communist state government popularly elected to power in India, in the southern state of Kerala. Soon after taking its oath of office in 1957, the government introduced the controversial Land Reforms Ordinance, which was later made into an act. This, along with an Education Bill, raised a massive uproar from the landlord classes. The popular slogan for the radical socialists was &quot;the land for tillers&quot;, which sent shock-waves through the landlord classes in the country. The ordinance set an absolute ceiling on the amount of land a family could own. The tenants and hut dwellers received a claim in the excess land, on which they had worked for centuries under the feudal system. In addition, the law ensured of tenure and protection from eviction.
These ground-breaking measures caused the premature death of the state government, as the central government, under Jawaharlal Nehru, used article 356 to dismiss it, alleging the breakdown of law and order. The land reforms in Kerala imparted drastic changes to the political, economic and social outlook.
Different types of feudal relations existed in Travancore-Cochin and Malabar at the time of the formation of the state. The landless farmers and those who were evicted from their land wanted to get their grievances redressed. The clamour for changes gathered strength. The government which came to power in 1957 introduced the Land Reforms Bill in the Legislative Assembly. The Agrarian Relations Bill introduced in 1958 was passed with minor amendments. The legislature passed subsequent land reform bills in 1960, 1963, and 1964. But the historical land reform act, Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1969 by C. Achutha Menon government which put an end to the feudal system and ensured the rights of the tenants on land, came into force on 1 January 1970. However, cash crop plantations had been exempted from its purview. There have been many amendments to the act since, the latest having been in 2012.

==Main objectives==
* To bestow on tenants ownership of a minimum of ten cents of land
* To end the old feudal relations by legitimizing the right of real peasants to own the land they cultivate
* To introduce land ceiling and distribute excess land among the landless agricultural labourers
* To abolish exploitation and inequalities in the agrarian sector
* To ensure the consistent progress and transformation of society
* To achieve economic development and modernisation
* To end the era of feudalism

==Impact==
* Leasing of land became unlawful.
* The Jenmis who lived by collecting lease became extinct.
* The lease holders were given ownership of the land.
* A few big farmers who had cultivated on the leased lands also became owners of that land.
* Land owners sold their excess land.
* Hundreds of thousands of people got dwelling places of their own.
* The labour market was enlarged as former serfs entered it.

<doc id="220289" wikidata="Q420818" url="?curid=220289" title="Brown-necked raven">
<text>The brown-necked raven (Corvus ruficollis) is a larger bird (52–56 cm in length) than the carrion crow though not as large as the common raven. It has similar proportions to the common raven but the bill is not so large or deep and the wings tend to be a little more pointed in profile. The head and throat are a distinct brownish-black giving the bird its English name, while the rest of the plumage is black glossed with purple, blue or purplish-blue. Like the common raven, thick-billed raven and white-necked raven, it is one of the larger raven species. The feathers of this species often fade quite quickly to a brownish black (even the truly black feathers) and the bird can look distinctly brown by the time it moults. The feet, legs and bill are black. The dwarf raven was formerly considered a subspecies (&quot;Corvus ruficollis edithae&quot;) but this bird now appears to be closer to the pied crow (&quot;C. albus&quot;) than this species.

== Distribution and habitat ==
This species has a wide range across virtually the whole of North Africa, down as far as Kenya, the Arabian Peninsula and up into the Greater Middle East and southern Iran. It lives in a predominantly desert environment visiting oases and palm groves.

Food consists of a wide range of items, including carrion, snakes, locusts and other grasshoppers, stranded fish (in coastal areas), grain stolen from bags, dates and other fruits. It is quite fearless when not persecuted but is quick to become wary and shy if too much attention is paid to it. A 2009 Israeli study showed the species to cooperatively hunt lizards, with birds blocking exits while others hunted.

== Nesting ==

The nest is very much like the common raven&#x27;s, and may be found in trees, on cliffs or in old and ruined buildings. The dwarf raven seems to prefer thorn trees for its nest building. There are usually 4–5 eggs laid and incubated over 20–22 days. The young usually leave the nest by the 37th or 38th day and can fly well by 42–45 days.

== Vocalisation ==

The voice is very similar to the common raven&#x27;s consisting mainly of croaks, though higher in pitch; and a harsh &quot;karr-karr-karr&quot;. In flight, it will utter a &quot;kuerk-kuerk&quot; call. Like all corvids, the Brown-necked raven is capable of vocal mimicry, however this behavior is mostly recorded in captivity and, although rarely, in the wild.

<doc id="220304" wikidata="Q5440532" url="?curid=220304" title="Federal holidays in the United States">
<text>Federal holidays in the United States are 11 calendar dates designated by the U.S. federal government as holidays. On these days non-essential U.S. federal government offices are closed and federal employees are paid for the day off.&lt;ref name=&quot;commerce/holidays&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal holidays are designated by the United States Congress in Title V of the United States Code (). Congress only has authority to create holidays for federal institutions (including federally-owned properties), employees, and the District of Columbia. As a general rule of courtesy, custom, and sometimes regulation, other institutions, such as banks, businesses, schools, and the financial markets, may be closed on federal holidays. In various parts of the country, state and city holidays may be observed concurrently with federal holidays.

==History==
The history of national holidays in the United States dates back to June 28, 1870, when Congress created national holidays &quot;to correspond with similar laws of States around the District...and...in every State of the Union.&quot; Although at first applicable only to federal employees in the Washington, D.C., Congress extended coverage in 1885 to all federal employees.

The original four holidays in 1870 were:

* New Year&#x27;s Day
* Independence Day
* Thanksgiving Day
* Christmas Day

George Washington&#x27;s Birthday became a federal holiday in 1879. In 1888 and 1894, respectively, Decoration Day (now Memorial Day) and Labor Day were created. Armistice Day was established in 1938 to honor the end of World War I, and the scope of the holiday was expanded to honor American soldiers who fought in World War II and the Korean War when it was renamed Veterans Day in 1954.

In 1968, the Uniform Monday Holiday Act gave several holidays &quot;floating&quot; dates so that they always fall on a Monday, and also established Columbus Day.

In 1983, President Ronald Reagan signed the bill that created Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day. It was first observed three years later, although some states resisted making it a state holiday. It was finally celebrated both nationally and by each of the states in 2000. Dr. King&#x27;s birthday is January 15th.

On June 17, 2021, President Joe Biden signed the law that made June 19th a federal holiday. Officially designated as &quot;Juneteenth National Independence Day&quot;, Juneteenth commemorates the belated June 19, 1865, announcement that enslaved people in the Confederate states had been freed by President Abraham Lincoln as of January 1, 1863. President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, which declared &quot;that all persons held as slaves&quot; within the rebellious states &quot;are, and henceforward shall be free&quot;. A National Park Service fact sheet explains that &quot;the word &#x27;Juneteenth&#x27; is a Black English contraction, or portmanteau, of the month &#x27;June&#x27; and the date &#x27;Nineteenth&#x27;. Juneteenth celebrates the date of June 19, 1865, when enslaved people of African descent located in Galveston, Texas, finally learned of their freedom from the system of slavery in the United States.&quot; President Biden&#x27;s annual proclamation in 2024 began, &quot;On June 19, 1865, freedom finally came for the 250,000 enslaved people of Texas. That day, which would become known as Juneteenth, the Army arrived to enforce what had already been the law of the land for two and a half years—the Emancipation Proclamation&quot;.

On October 3, 1789, at the request of the U.S. Congress, President George Washington issued a Thanksgiving proclamation designating November 26, 1789 as a day of &quot;public thanksgiving and prayer&quot; for the &quot;People of the United States&quot;. Thanksgiving has been proclaimed in the U.S. for various months and days of the week, including March, August, September, November, December, and on Sundays.

Celebrated on December 25 around the world, Christmas is the day that Christians remember the birth and incarnation of Jesus Christ. In the United States, Christmas Day as a federal or public holiday is sometimes objected to by various non-Christians, usually due to its ties with Christianity. In December 1999, the Western Division of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, in the case &quot;Ganulin v. United States&quot;, denied the charge that Christmas Day&#x27;s federal status violated the Establishment Clause of the Constitution, ruling that &quot;the Christmas holiday has become largely secularized&quot;, and that &quot;by giving federal employees a paid vacation day on Christmas, the government is doing no more than recognizing the cultural significance of the holiday&quot;.

== List of federal holidays ==
Most of the 11 U.S. federal holidays are also state holidays. Five of the &quot;floating&quot; date holidays always fall on a Monday; the remaining floating holiday, Thanksgiving, is always on a Thursday. The rest are on fixed dates. A fixed date holiday that falls on a weekend (Saturday and Sunday) is usually observed for federal employees on the closest weekday: a holiday falling on a Saturday is observed on the preceding Friday, while a holiday falling on a Sunday is observed on the succeeding Monday. The official names come from the statute that defines holidays for federal employees.
Inauguration Day, held on January 20 every four years following a quadrennial presidential election, if not falling on the Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., is considered a paid holiday for federal employees in the Washington, D.C., area by the Office of Personnel Management. It is not considered a federal holiday in the United States equivalent to the eleven holidays mentioned above.

Although many states recognize most or all federal holidays as state holidays, the federal government cannot enact laws to compel them to do so. States can recognize other days as state holidays that are not federal holidays. For example, the State of Texas recognizes all federal holidays except Columbus Day, and recognizes the Friday after Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, and the day after Christmas as state holidays.

Texas does not follow the federal rule of closing either the Friday before, if a holiday falls on a Saturday, or the Monday after if a holiday falls on a Sunday. Offices are open on those Fridays or Mondays. Texas has &quot;partial staffing holidays&quot;, such as March 2, which is Texas Independence Day, and &quot;optional holidays&quot;, such as Good Friday.

Private employers are not required to observe federal or state holidays, the key exception being federally-chartered banks. Some private employers, often by a union contract, pay a differential such as time-and-a-half or double-time to employees who work on some federal holidays. Employees not specifically covered by a union contract, might only receive their standard pay for working on a federal holiday, depending on the company policy.

== Legal holidays due to presidential proclamation ==

Federal law also provides for the declaration of other public holidays by the President of the United States. Generally the president will provide a reasoning behind the elevation of the day, and call on the people of the United States to observe the day &quot;with appropriate ceremonies and activities.&quot;

Examples of presidentially declared holidays were the days of the funerals for former Presidents Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush, and Jimmy Carter; when federal government offices are closed and employees given a paid holiday.

In addition, occasionally the President will grant Christmas Eve as a holiday or partial holiday (the latter generally being four hours for full-time employees).

==Proposed federal holidays==
Many federal holidays have been proposed. As the U.S. federal government is a large employer, the holidays are expensive. If a holiday is controversial, opposition will generally prevent bills enacting them from passing. For example, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, marking King&#x27;s birthday, took much effort to pass and for all states to recognize it. It was not until 2000 that this holiday was officially observed in all 50 states.

The following list is an example of holidays that have been proposed and reasons why they are not observed at the federal level. Some of these holidays are observed at the state level.
==Controversy==

Some Native American groups protest the observance of Columbus Day, mainly due to the controversy of Columbus&#x27; arrival to the Americas.
Alaska, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, South Dakota, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin do not recognize Columbus Day. Hawaii and South Dakota mark the day with an alternative holiday or observance. South Dakota is the only state to recognize Native American Day as an official state holiday.

<doc id="220314" wikidata="Q2490641" url="?curid=220314" title="Instruction pipelining">
<text>In computer engineering, instruction pipelining is a technique for implementing instruction-level parallelism within a single processor. Pipelining attempts to keep every part of the processor busy with some instruction by dividing incoming instructions into a series of sequential steps (the eponymous &quot;pipeline&quot;) performed by different processor units with different parts of instructions processed in parallel.

==Concept and motivation==
In a pipelined computer, instructions flow through the central processing unit (CPU) in stages. For example, it might have one stage for each step of the von Neumann cycle: Fetch the instruction, fetch the operands, do the instruction, write the results. A pipelined computer usually has &quot;pipeline registers&quot; after each stage. These store information from the instruction and calculations so that the logic gates of the next stage can do the next step.

This arrangement lets the CPU complete an instruction on each clock cycle. It is common for even-numbered stages to operate on one edge of the square-wave clock, while odd-numbered stages operate on the other edge. This allows more CPU throughput than a multicycle computer at a given clock rate, but may increase latency due to the added overhead of the pipelining process itself. Also, even though the electronic logic has a fixed maximum speed, a pipelined computer can be made faster or slower by varying the number of stages in the pipeline. With more stages, each stage does less work, and so the stage has fewer delays from the logic gates and could run at a higher clock rate.

A pipelined model of computer is often the most economical, when cost is measured as logic gates per instruction per second. At each instant, an instruction is in only one pipeline stage, and on average, a pipeline stage is less costly than a multicycle computer. Also, when made well, most of the pipelined computer&#x27;s logic is in use most of the time. In contrast, out of order computers usually have large amounts of idle logic at any given instant. Similar calculations usually show that a pipelined computer uses less energy per instruction.

However, a pipelined computer is usually more complex and more costly than a comparable multicycle computer. It typically has more logic gates, registers and a more complex control unit. In a like way, it might use more total energy, while using less energy per instruction. Out of order CPUs can usually do more instructions per second because they can do several instructions at once.

In a pipelined computer, the control unit arranges for the flow to start, continue, and stop as a program commands. The instruction data is usually passed in pipeline registers from one stage to the next, with a somewhat separated piece of control logic for each stage. The control unit also assures that the instruction in each stage does not harm the operation of instructions in other stages. For example, if two stages must use the same piece of data, the control logic assures that the uses are done in the correct sequence.

When operating efficiently, a pipelined computer will have an instruction in each stage. It is then working on all of those instructions at the same time. It can finish about one instruction for each cycle of its clock. But when a program switches to a different sequence of instructions, the pipeline sometimes must discard the data in process and restart. This is called a &quot;stall.&quot;

Much of the design of a pipelined computer prevents interference between the stages and reduces stalls.

===Number of steps===
The number of dependent steps varies with the machine architecture. For example:
* The 1956–61 IBM Stretch project proposed the terms Fetch, Decode, and Execute that have become common.
* The classic RISC pipeline comprises:
*# Instruction fetch
*# Instruction decode and register fetch
*# Execute
*# Memory access
*# Register write back
* The Atmel AVR and the PIC microcontroller each have a two-stage pipeline.
* Many designs include pipelines as long as 7, 10 and even 20 stages (as in the Intel Pentium 4).
* The later &quot;Prescott&quot; and &quot;Cedar Mill&quot; NetBurst cores from Intel, used in the last Pentium 4 models and their Pentium D and Xeon derivatives, have a long 31-stage pipeline.
* The Xelerated X10q Network Processor has a pipeline more than a thousand stages long, although in this case 200 of these stages represent independent CPUs with individually programmed instructions. The remaining stages are used to coordinate accesses to memory and on-chip function units.

As the pipeline is made &quot;deeper&quot; (with a greater number of dependent steps), a given step can be implemented with simpler circuitry, which may let the processor clock run faster. Such pipelines may be called &quot;superpipelines.&quot;

A processor is said to be &quot;fully pipelined&quot; if it can fetch an instruction on every cycle. Thus, if some instructions or conditions require delays that inhibit fetching new instructions, the processor is not fully pipelined.

Seminal uses of pipelining were in the ILLIAC II project and the IBM Stretch project, though a simple version was used earlier in the Z1 in 1939 and the Z3 in 1941.

Pipelining began in earnest in the late 1970s in supercomputers such as vector processors and array processors. One of the early supercomputers was the Cyber series built by Control Data Corporation. Its main architect, Seymour Cray, later headed Cray Research. Cray developed the XMP line of supercomputers, using pipelining for both multiply and add/subtract functions. Later, Star Technologies added parallelism (several pipelined functions working in parallel), developed by Roger Chen. In 1984, Star Technologies added the pipelined divide circuit developed by James Bradley. By the mid-1980s, pipelining was used by many different companies around the world.

Pipelining was not limited to supercomputers. In 1976, the Amdahl Corporation&#x27;s 470 series general purpose mainframe had a 7-step pipeline, and a patented branch prediction circuit.

===Hazards===
The model of sequential execution assumes that each instruction completes before the next one begins; this assumption is not true on a pipelined processor. A situation where the expected result is problematic is known as a hazard. Imagine the following two register instructions to a hypothetical processor:
 1: add 1 to R5
 2: copy R5 to R6
If the processor has the 5 steps listed in the initial illustration (the &#x27;Basic five-stage pipeline&#x27; at the start of the article), instruction 1 would be fetched at time &quot;t&quot;1 and its execution would be complete at &quot;t5&quot;. Instruction 2 would be fetched at &quot;t2&quot; and would be complete at &quot;t6&quot;. The first instruction might deposit the incremented number into R5 as its fifth step (register write back) at &quot;t5&quot;. But the second instruction might get the number from R5 (to copy to R6) in its second step (instruction decode and register fetch) at time &quot;t3&quot;. It seems that the first instruction would not have incremented the value by then. The above code invokes a hazard.

Writing computer programs in a compiled language might not raise these concerns, as the compiler could be designed to generate machine code that avoids hazards.

====Workarounds====
In some early DSP and RISC processors, the documentation advises programmers to avoid such dependencies in adjacent and nearly adjacent instructions (called delay slots), or declares that the second instruction uses an old value rather than the desired value (in the example above, the processor might counter-intuitively copy the unincremented value), or declares that the value it uses is undefined. The programmer may have unrelated work that the processor can do in the meantime; or, to ensure correct results, the programmer may insert NOPs into the code, partly negating the advantages of pipelining.

====Solutions====
Pipelined processors commonly use three techniques to work as expected when the programmer assumes that each instruction completes before the next one begins:
*The pipeline could stall, or cease scheduling new instructions until the required values are available. This results in empty slots in the pipeline, or &quot;bubbles&quot;, in which no work is performed.
*An additional data path can be added that routes a computed value to a future instruction elsewhere in the pipeline before the instruction that produced it has been fully retired, a process called operand forwarding.
*The processor can locate other instructions which are not dependent on the current ones and which can be immediately executed without hazards, an optimization known as out-of-order execution.

===Branches===
A branch out of the normal instruction sequence often involves a hazard. Unless the processor can give effect to the branch in a single time cycle, the pipeline will continue fetching instructions sequentially. Such instructions cannot be allowed to take effect because the programmer has diverted control to another part of the program.

A conditional branch is even more problematic. The processor may or may not branch, depending on a calculation that has not yet occurred. Various processors may stall, may attempt branch prediction, and may be able to begin to execute two different program sequences (eager execution), each assuming the branch is or is not taken, discarding all work that pertains to the incorrect guess.

A processor with an implementation of branch prediction that usually makes correct predictions can minimize the performance penalty from branching. However, if branches are predicted poorly, it may create more work for the processor, such as flushing from the pipeline the incorrect code path that has begun execution before resuming execution at the correct location.

Programs written for a pipelined processor deliberately avoid branching to minimize possible loss of speed. For example, the programmer can handle the usual case with sequential execution and branch only on detecting unusual cases. Using programs such as gcov to analyze code coverage lets the programmer measure how often particular branches are actually executed and gain insight with which to optimize the code.
In some cases, a programmer can handle both the usual case and unusual case with branch-free code.

===Special situations===
; Self-modifying programs
: The technique of self-modifying code can be problematic on a pipelined processor. In this technique, one of the effects of a program is to modify its own upcoming instructions. If the processor has an instruction cache, the original instruction may already have been copied into a prefetch input queue and the modification will not take effect. Some processors such as the Zilog Z280 can configure their on-chip cache memories for data-only fetches, or as part of their ordinary memory address space, and avoid such difficulties with self-modifying instructions.

; Uninterruptible instructions
: An instruction may be uninterruptible to ensure its atomicity, such as when it swaps two items. A sequential processor permits interrupts between instructions, but a pipelining processor overlaps instructions, so executing an uninterruptible instruction renders portions of ordinary instructions uninterruptible too. The Cyrix coma bug would hang a single-core system using an infinite loop in which an uninterruptible instruction was always in the pipeline.

==Design considerations==
; Speed
: Pipelining keeps all portions of the processor occupied and increases the amount of useful work the processor can do in a given time. Pipelining typically reduces the processor&#x27;s cycle time and increases the throughput of instructions. The speed advantage is diminished to the extent that execution encounters hazards that require execution to slow below its ideal rate. A non-pipelined processor executes only a single instruction at a time. The start of the next instruction is delayed not based on hazards but unconditionally.

: A pipelined processor&#x27;s need to organize all its work into modular steps may require the duplication of registers, which increases the latency of some instructions.

; Economy
: By making each dependent step simpler, pipelining can enable complex operations more economically than adding complex circuitry, such as for numerical calculations. However, a processor that declines to pursue increased speed with pipelining may be simpler and cheaper to manufacture.

; Predictability
: Compared to environments where the programmer needs to avoid or work around hazards, use of a non-pipelined processor may make it easier to program and to train programmers. The non-pipelined processor also makes it easier to predict the exact timing of a given sequence of instructions.

==Illustrated example==

To the right is a generic pipeline with four stages: fetch, decode, execute and write-back. The top gray box is the list of instructions waiting to be executed, the bottom gray box is the list of instructions that have had their execution completed, and the middle white box is the pipeline.

The execution is as follows:

===Pipeline bubble===

A pipelined processor may deal with hazards by stalling and creating a bubble in the pipeline, resulting in one or more cycles in which nothing useful happens.

In the illustration at right, in cycle 3, the processor cannot decode the purple instruction, perhaps because the processor determines that decoding depends on results produced by the execution of the green instruction. The green instruction can proceed to the Execute stage and then to the Write-back stage as scheduled, but the purple instruction is stalled for one cycle at the Fetch stage. The blue instruction, which was due to be fetched during cycle 3, is stalled for one cycle, as is the red instruction after it.

Because of the bubble (the blue ovals in the illustration), the processor&#x27;s Decode circuitry is idle during cycle 3. Its Execute circuitry is idle during cycle 4 and its Write-back circuitry is idle during cycle 5.

When the bubble moves out of the pipeline (at cycle 6), normal execution resumes. But everything now is one cycle late. It will take 8 cycles (cycle 1 through 8) rather than 7 to completely execute the four instructions shown in colors.

<text>Cochem-Zell (German: &quot;Landkreis Cochem-Zell&quot;) is a district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) in the north-west of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Neighboring districts are Mayen-Koblenz, Rhein-Hunsrück, Bernkastel-Wittlich, and Vulkaneifel.

== History ==
In 1816 the districts Cochem and Zell were created, after the area went to Prussia. In 1969 the Zell district was dissolved and its northern and middle parts were added to the Cochem district, which was renamed Cochem-Zell. In 2014 the municipalities Lahr, Mörsdorf and Zilshausen were assigned to the Rhein-Hunsrück-Kreis.

== Geography ==
The district consists of three different landscapes. The Moselle valley with its vineyards, and the mountains of the Hunsrück in the east and the Eifel in the north and west. The highest elevation is the &quot;Höchstberg&quot; at 616 m above sea level, located in the Eifel.

== Coat of arms ==
The German blazon reads: &quot;Schräglinks geteilt: vorne in Silber ein durchgehendes rotes Kreuz, belegt mit einem silbernem Hifthorn mit goldenem Riemen; hinten in Schwarz ein wachsender, rot bewehrter, gezungter und gekrönter goldener Löwe&quot;.

This might in English heraldic language be rendered thus: Per bend sinister argent a cross gules surmounted by a bugle-horn of the first, the bell to sinister, stringed Or, and sable issuant from base a lion rampant, his dexter paw couped at the line of partition, of the third armed, langued and crowned of the second.

The upper part of the coat of arms shows the main charge of the coat of arms of the Zell district, the cross of Trier, as the Bishops of Trier had a castle at Zell. The horn stands for the territory of Beilstein. The lion in the bottom is the symbol of the Electorate of the Palatinate; the Counts Palatine had a castle at Cochem.

<text>Hester Lynch Thrale Piozzi (née Salusbury; 27 January 1741 or 16 January 1740 – 2 May 1821) was a Welsh writer and socialite who was an important source on Samuel Johnson and 18th-century British life. She belonged to the prominent Salusbury family of Anglo-Welsh landowners, and married firstly a wealthy brewer, Henry Thrale, with whom she had 12 children, then a music teacher, Gabriel Mario Piozzi. Her &quot;Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson&quot; (1786) and her diary &quot;Thraliana&quot;, published posthumously in 1942, are the main works for which she is remembered. She also wrote a popular history book, a travel book, and a dictionary. She has been seen as a protofeminist.

==Early years==

Hester Lynch Salusbury was born at Bodvel Hall, Caernarvonshire, Wales, the only daughter of Hester Lynch Cotton and Sir John Salusbury. As a member of the powerful Salusbury family, she belonged to one of the most illustrious Welsh land-owning dynasties of the Georgian era. Through her father&#x27;s line, she was a direct descendant of Katheryn of Berain.
Hester enjoyed the devoted attention of her uncles and was educated to a high level for a young woman. She would later describe that &quot;they had taught me to read and speak and think and translate from the French, till I was half a prodigy.&quot;

==Career==
===First marriage===
After her father had gone bankrupt in an attempt to invest in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Hester married the rich brewer Henry Thrale on 11 October 1763, at St Anne&#x27;s Chapel, Soho, London. They had twelve children and lived at Streatham Park. However, the marriage was often strained: her husband frequently felt slighted by members of the court and may well have married to improve his social status. The Thrales&#x27; eldest daughter, Hester, became a viscountess as the wife of George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith.

After her marriage, Thrale was free to associate with whom she pleased. Due to her husband&#x27;s financial status, she was able to enter London society, as a result of which she met Samuel Johnson, James Boswell, Bishop Thomas Percy, Oliver Goldsmith, and other literary figures, including the young Frances Burney, whom she took with her to Gay Street, Bath.

In July 1774 Johnson visited Wales in Thrale&#x27;s company, during which time they visited Hester&#x27;s uncle Sir Lynch Cotton at Combermere in Denbighshire. Frances, the wife of Sir Lynch&#x27;s son Robert &quot;found Johnson, despite his rudeness, at times delightful, having a manner peculiar to himself in relating anecdotes that could not fail to attract old and young. Her impression was that Thrale was very vexatious in wishing to engross all his attention, which annoyed him much.&quot;

Johnson wrote two verses for Thrale in 1775, the first to celebrate her 35th birthday, and another in Latin to honour her.

Frances Burney, in her diary, describes the conversations at several of Thrale&#x27;s soirées, including one in 1779 about a young woman named Sophy Streatfeild (1755–1835), a daughter of Henry Streatfeild, who was a favourite of Mr Johnson and Mr Thrale, rather to the chagrin of Hester, who commented that Sophy &quot;had a power of captivation that was irresistible... her beauty joined to her softness, her caressing manners, her tearful eyes, and alluring looks, would insinuate her into the heart of any man she thought worth attacking.&quot; The touch of jealousy here is further revealed in Thrale&#x27;s remarking (after another of her male guests had professed devotion to Miss Streatfeild and the desire to &quot;soothe&quot; her): &quot;I would ensure her power of crying herself into any of your hearts she pleased. I made her cry to Miss Burney, to show how beautiful she looked in tears&quot; and (on being rebuked about this) &quot;Oh but she liked it ... Miss Burney would have run away but she came forward on purpose to show herself. Sophy Streatfeild is never happier than when tears trickle down from her fine eyes in company.&quot;

The Thrales were in Bath in 1780 at the time of the Gordon Riots, when a Roman Catholic chapel was set on fire, although the greater worry for them was whether Thrale&#x27;s brewery in Southwark would escape being ransacked, which it narrowly did.

Burney records Thrale&#x27;s distress on losing her husband (4 April 1781), referring to her as &quot;sweet Mrs. Thrale&quot; and sympathising with the &quot;agitation&quot; she was under in having to sell the brewery and wind up his affairs. Burney was there to congratulate and cheer Thrale when the business was concluded.

At this time, 1781, Thrale was socialising with Whig members of parliament such as William Smith, the abolitionist, Benjamin Vaughan and writers, including Helen Maria Williams and Anna Laetitia Barbauld at Southhampton Row in Bloomsbury, London.

===Second marriage===
During the ensuing years, Thrale fell in love with Gabriel Mario Piozzi, an Italian music teacher who had taught the Thrales&#x27; children, and married him on 25 July 1784. She complained: &quot;I see the English newspapers are full of gross Insolence towards me,&quot; with one commenting how Thrale could not have imagined &quot;his wife&#x27;s disgrace, by eventually raising an obscure and penniless Fiddler into sudden Wealth.&quot; This caused a rift with Johnson, which was only perfunctorily mended shortly before his death. The levelling marriage also earned her the disapproval of Burney (who would herself marry in 1793 the impoverished, Catholic émigré Alexandre D&#x27;Arblay) and her cousins the Cottons. Thrale and Piozzi subsequently left England to travel in Europe for three years, especially in Italy and often following traditional routes of the Grand Tour. 

Thrale retired to Brynbella, a newly built country house on her &quot;Bach y Graig&quot; estate in the Vale of Clwyd, near Tremeirchion in north Wales in 1795. She and her husband eventually adopted his nephew, John Salusbury Piozzi Salusbury, who arrived in Britain in 1798, moved to Brynbella after his marriage in 1814, which she gifted to him, and eventually became heir to the Salusbury family properties and name.

===Written works===
After Johnson&#x27;s death, she published &quot;Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson&quot; (1786) and their letters to each other (1788).

Frances Burney, who considered both Johnson and Thrale to be among her dearest friends, read the unpublished manuscript with much interest, but disapproved of the decision to publish, noting, &quot;She has given all – every word – and thinks that, perhaps, a justice to Dr Johnson, which, in fact, is the greatest injury to his memory.&quot;

Together with Thrale&#x27;s diaries, which were known as &quot;Thraliana&quot; and not published until 1942, these sources help to fill out the biased picture of Johnson often presented in James Boswell&#x27;s &quot;Life of Samuel Johnson&quot;. Johnson often stayed with the Thrale household and had his own room above the library at Streatham, in which he worked. The friendship between Johnson and Thrale was emotionally intimate, and after her husband died in 1781 &quot;Johnson&#x27;s circle took it for granted that he would marry Hester.&quot;

Based upon two letters Johnson wrote to Thrale in French and a passage in Thrale&#x27;s &quot;Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson,&quot; Thrale&#x27;s biographer Ian McIntyre and Johnson&#x27;s biographers Peter Martin and Jeffrey Meyers have suggested that Thrale and Johnson had a sadomasochistic relationship in which Thrale whipped Johnson.

Thrale also wrote &quot;Observations and Reflections made in the Course of a Journey through France, Italy, and Germany&quot; (1789), which describes her travels during her honeymoon with Piozzi. The book mostly focuses on their travel in Italy. Notably, it was one of the first travelogues written by a British woman that was written in prose rather than in letters. Although there was only one edition, it was famous enough that Queen Charlotte read it. She was also the author of two plays, both unproduced.

Her &quot;Retrospection...&quot; (1801) was an attempt at a popular history of that period, but was not received well by critics, some of whom patently resented female intrusion into what was then the male preserve of history. Reviewers also coupled sexism with ageism in dismissing her work. One reviewer called it &quot;a series of dreams by an old lady.&quot;

According to the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, &quot;it has since been seen as a feminist history, concerned to show changes in manners and mores in so far as they affected women; it has also been judged to anticipate Marxian history in its keen apprehension of reification: &#x27;machines imitated mortals to unhoped perfection, and men found out they were themselves machines.&#x27;&quot;

A lexicographer in her own right, Mrs Piozzi&#x27;s &quot;British synonymy, or, An attempt at regulating the choice of words in familiar conversation&quot; was published in 1794 by G. G. &amp; J. Robinson of London, ten years after Dr Johnson&#x27;s death.

==Death and legacy==
Hester Piozzi died at No. 10 (now 20) Sion Row, Clifton, Bristol, of complications after a fall, and was buried on 16 May 1821 near Brynbella in the churchyard of Corpus Christi Church, Tremeirchion, next to Piozzi. A marble plaque inside the church was erected in 1909:
Near this place are interred the remains of

28th April 1909.

Frances Burney eulogised her, going so far as to make a comparison with Germaine de Staël.

From the time of her death almost up to the present, she was referred to by scholars as Johnson had done, as Mrs Thrale or Hester Thrale. Nowadays she is often referred to as Hester Lynch Piozzi or Mrs Piozzi.

Samuel Beckett drew on Thrale&#x27;s diaries and &quot;Anecdotes&quot; to dramatize her and Johnson&#x27;s relationship in one of his earliest plays, &quot;Human Wishes&quot;. However, he abandoned the play after completing the first act.

Author Lillian de la Torre featured Thrale in the story &quot;The Stolen Christmas Box&quot;, part of a series featuring Johnson as a detective.

A three-act opera, &quot;Johnson Preserv&#x27;d&quot;, was written by the English composer Richard Stoker, with a libretto by Jill Watt. The characters are Dr Samuel Johnson, James Boswell, Hester Thrale, Gabriel Piozzi, and Mrs Thrale&#x27;s maid Polly (the only fictitious character). The opera was performed by Opera Piccola at St Pancras Town Hall, London, in July 1967, with the tenor Philip Langridge performing the role of Piozzi. It was conducted by Vilem Tausky and directed by Anthony Sharp. The vocal score was published by Peters Edition in 1971.

Mrs Thrale, also referred to as Signora Piozzi, is a major character in the play &quot;Fanny Burney&quot;, based on scenes in Burney&#x27;s life, from the age of sixteen to eighty-eight, in Elizabeth Goudge&#x27;s &quot;Three Plays&quot; (Duckworth, London, 1939); along with Burney&#x27;s father Charles Burney, and her sister, Susan, and Samuel Johnson and James Boswell, Alexandre D&#x27;Arblay (Burney&#x27;s French emigré husband), and William Thackeray.
