<text>The Workers&#x27; Party (, PT) is a centre-left political party in Brazil that is currently the country&#x27;s ruling party. Some scholars classify its ideology in the 21st century as social democracy, with the party shifting from a broadly socialist ideology in the 1990s, although the party retains a left-wing and marginal far-left faction to this day. Founded in 1980, PT governed at the federal level in a coalition government with several other parties from 1 January 2003 to 31 August 2016. After the 2002 parliamentary election, PT became the largest party in the Chamber of Deputies and the largest in the Federal Senate for the first time. With the highest approval rating in the history of the country at one time, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was PT&#x27;s most prominent member. Dilma Rousseff, also a member of PT, was elected twice (first on 31 October 2010, and then again on 26 October 2014) but did not finish her second term due to her impeachment in 2016. The party came back to power with Lula&#x27;s victory in the 2022 presidential election.

Both born among the opposition to the 1964 &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; and the subsequent military dictatorship, PT and the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) were the biggest adversaries in contemporary Brazilian politics from 1994 to 2014, with their candidates finishing either first or second on the ballot in each presidential election in that period. The Worker&#x27;s Party won five presidential elections since the country reinstated democracy, and came in second in every other election held in that time.

The party has been involved in a number of corruption scandals since Lula first came to power and saw its popular support plummet between 2015 and 2020, with presidential approval ratings falling from over 80% to 9% and successive reductions in all elected offices since 2014. The 2022 general election marked a turning point in that trajectory.

The party symbols are a five-pointed red star inscribed with the initials &quot;PT&quot; in the center; a red flag with a white star also with the initials in the center; and the Workers Party&#x27;s anthem. Its Superior Electoral Court (TSE) identification number is 13. Members and sympathisers of the party are known as &quot;Petistas&quot;.

==History==

The Workers&#x27; Party was launched by a heterogeneous group made up of militants opposed to Brazil&#x27;s military government, trade unionists, left-wing intellectuals and artists and Catholics linked to the liberation theology on 10 February 1980 at Colégio Sion in São Paulo, a private Catholic school for girls. The party emerged as a result of the approach between the labor movements in the ABC Region such as the Conferência das Classes Trabalhadoras (Conclat), later developed into the Central Única dos Trabalhadores (CUT) which carried major strikes from 1978 to 1980; and the old Brazilian left-wing, whose proponents, many of whom were journalists, intellectuals, artists and union organizers, were returning from exile with the 1979 Amnesty law, many of them having endured imprisonment and torture at the hands of the military regime in addition to years of exile. Dilma Rousseff herself was imprisoned and tortured by the dictatorship.

PT was launched under a democratic socialism trend. After the 1964 &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, Brazil&#x27;s main federation of labor unions, the General Command of Workers (&quot;Comando Geral dos Trabalhadores&quot; – CGT), which gathered leaders approved by the Ministry of Labour since its formation, a practice tied to the fact that since Getúlio Vargas&#x27; dictatorship, unions had become quasi-state entities, was dissolved while unions themselves suffered intervention of the military regime.

The resurgence of an organized labour movement, evidenced by strikes in the ABC Region on the late 1970s led by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, enabled the reorganization of the labour movement without the direct interference of the state. The movement originally sought to act exclusively in union politics, but the survival of a conservative unionism under the domination of the state (evidenced in the refoundation of CGT) and the influence exercised over the trade union movement by leaders of traditional left-wing parties, such as the Brazilian Communist Party (&quot;Partido Comunista Brasileiro&quot;, PCB), forced the unionist movement of ABC, encouraged by anti-Stalinist leaders, to organize its own party.

PT was officially recognized as a party by the Brazilian Supreme Electoral Court on 11 February 1982. The first membership card belonged to art critic and former Trotskyist activist Mário Pedrosa, followed by literary scholar Antonio Candido and historian Sérgio Buarque de Holanda. Holanda&#x27;s daughter Ana de Holanda later became Minister of Culture in the Rousseff cabinet.

===Electoral history===
Since 1988, the Workers&#x27; Party has grown in popularity on the national stage by winning the elections in many of the largest Brazilian cities, such as São Paulo, Fortaleza, Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre and Goiânia as well as in some important states, such as Rio Grande do Sul, Espírito Santo and the Federal District. During the time it governed Porto Alegre, it implemented measures such as a progressive tax reform, involving the rich being taxed more highly to fund basic services for the poor, and the development of new institutions of genuine popular participation which gave, according to one study, &quot;real decision-making power to civil society and involving a large number of civil organizations – from neighbourhood groups to non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and from cultural groups to education, health and housing pressure groups – in running the city.&quot;

This winning streak culminated with the victory of its presidential candidate Lula in 2002 who succeeded Fernando Henrique Cardoso of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (&quot;Partido da Social Democracia Brasileira –&quot; PSDB). For its defense of economic liberalism, PSDB is the party&#x27;s main electoral rival as well as the Democrats, heir of the National Renewal Alliance (&quot;Aliança Renovadora Nacional –&quot; ARENA), ruling party during the military dictatorship. Along with the Popular Socialist Party (&quot;Partido Popular Socialista –&quot; PPS), a dissidence of PCB, they have been said to form the centre-right opposition to the Lula administration.

1989 presidential elections

In the 1989 general elections, Lula went to the second round with Fernando Collor de Mello. Even though all centrist and left-wing candidates of the first round united around Lula&#x27;s candidacy, Collor&#x27;s campaign was strongly supported by the mass media (notably Rede Globo as seen on the documentary &quot;Beyond Citizen Kane&quot;) and Lula lost in the second round by a close margin of 5.7%.

1994 and 1998 general elections

Leading up to the 1994 general elections, Lula was the leading presidential candidate in the majority of polls. As a result, centrist and right-wing parties openly united for Fernando Henrique Cardoso&#x27;s candidacy. As Minister of Economy, Cardoso created the Real Plan, which established the new currency and subsequently ended inflation and provided economic stability. As a result, Cardoso won the election in the first round with 54% of the votes. However, it has been noted that &quot;the elections were not a complete disaster for PT, which significantly increased its presence in the Congress and elected for the first time two state governors&quot;. Cardoso would once again beat Lula in a rematch and re-elected for a second term in 1998.

2002 general elections

After the detrition of PSDB&#x27;s image and as a result of an economic crisis that burst in the final years of Cardoso&#x27;s government, Lula won the 2002 presidential election in the second round.

2006 general elections

On 29 October 2006, PT won 83 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 11 seats in the Federal Senate. Lula was re-elected with more than 60% of the votes, extending his position as President of Brazil until 1 January 2011.

PT was now the second largest party in the Chamber of Deputies, the fourth largest party in the Federal Senate and has five state governorships. However, it only gained control of one among the ten richest states (Bahia).

2010 general elections
In the 2010 general elections held on 3 October, PT gained control of 17.15% of the seats in the Chamber of Deputies, a record for the party since 2002. With 88 seats gained, it became the largest party in the lower chamber for the first time ever. PT also became the second largest party in the Federal Senate for the first time after electing of 11 senators, making a total of 14 senators for the 2010–2014 legislature. Its national coalition gained control of 311 seats in the lower house and 50 seats in the upper house, a broad majority in both houses which the Lula administration never had. This election also saw the decrease in the number of seats controlled by the centre-right opposition bloc as it shrank from 133 to 111 deputies. The left-wing opposition, formed by PSOL, retained control of three seats.

The party was also expected to elect its presidential candidate Dilma Rousseff in the first round. However, she was not able to receive the necessary number of valid votes (over 50%) and a second round in which she scored 56% of the votes took place on 31 October 2010. On 1 January 2011, she was inaugurated and thus became the first female head of government ever in the history of Brazil and the first &quot;de facto&quot; female head of state since the death in 1816 of Maria I, Queen of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves.

In the 2010 elections, PT retained control of the governorships of Bahia, Sergipe and Acre, in addition to gaining back control of Rio Grande do Sul and the Federal District. Nevertheless, it lost control of Pará. Candidates supported by the party won the race in Amapá, Ceará, Espírito Santo, Maranhão, Mato Grosso, Pernambuco, Piauí and Rio de Janeiro, which means that PT would participate in 13 out of 27 state governorships.

2014 general elections
In the 2014 general elections held on 5 October, the party won 13.9% of the vote and 69 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, down from the 88 seats they gained in 2010. In the first round of the presidential election, Rousseff won 41.6% of the vote but not enough to secure a victory. In the run-off on 26 October, Rousseff was re-elected with a narrow victory with 51.6% of the vote against Senator Aécio Neves.

==Cabinet representation==
PT enjoyed strong representation in the cabinets it led for most of the time that it was in office. PT held the majority of cabinet positions in the first two coalitions, with its occupation of ministerial positions comprising 60% in the first coalition, 54.8% in the second coalition and 46.5% in the third coalition.

==Ideology==

Although PT deliberately never identified itself with a particular brand of leftism, it nevertheless &quot;always defined itself as socialist&quot; and espoused many radical positions. For example, at the Brazilian Constituent Assembly of 1988 it advocated repudiation of Brazil&#x27;s external debt, nationalization of the country&#x27;s banks and mineral wealth and a radical land reform. In addition, as a form of protest and as a signal that the party did not fully accept the &quot;rules of the game&quot; PT&#x27;s delegates refused to sign the draft constitution.

Over the next few years, the party moderated a bit, but it never clearly shed its radicalism and undertook no major reforms of party principles even after Lula&#x27;s defeat in the 1989 presidential elections. For example, the resolution from the party&#x27;s 8th National Meeting in 1993 reaffirmed PT&#x27;s &quot;revolutionary and socialist character&quot;, condemned the &quot;conspiracy&quot; of the elites to subvert democracy, stated that the party advocated &quot;radical agrarian reform and suspension of the external debt&quot; and concluded that &quot;capitalism and private property cannot provide a future for humanity&quot;.

In 1994, Lula ran for the presidency again and during his campaign dismissed Fernando Henrique Cardoso&#x27;s recently implemented Real Plan as an &quot;electoral swindle&quot;. The resolutions from the 1994 National Meeting condemned the &quot;control by the dominant classes over the means of production&quot; and reaffirmed the party&#x27;s &quot;commitment to socialism&quot;. PT&#x27;s Program of Government that year also committed the party to &quot;anti-monopolist, anti-latifúndio, and anti-imperialist change [...] as part of a long-term strategy to construct an alternative to capitalism&quot;, statements that &quot;sent shivers down the spine of the international financial community&quot;. Thus, as of 1995 &quot;little or nothing&quot; had changed in PT&#x27;s official ideology since the early 1990s.

After Lula&#x27;s 1994 loss, the party began a slow process of self-examination. The resolution adopted at its 10th National Meeting in 1995 stated that &quot;our 1994 defeat invites a cruel reflection about our image in society, about the external impact of our internal battles, [and] about our ideological and political ambiguities&quot;. The move from self-examination did not involve a clean break with the past as in other socialist parties after the end of the Cold War. The process was gradual, full of contradictions and replete with intra-party tension. By 1997, the National Meeting resolution redefined PT&#x27;s version of socialism as a &quot;democratic revolution&quot;, emphasizing a political rather than economic vision of socialism that aimed to make the state &quot;more transparent and socially accountable&quot;.

Lula&#x27;s third presidential campaign platform in 1998 cut socialist proposals and even the mention of a transition to a socialist society, but the party&#x27;s self-definition remained highly ambiguous as the resolution from the party&#x27;s Meeting that year affirmed that Lula&#x27;s platform &quot;should not be confused with the socialist program of PT&quot;. Thus, while PT had begun to distance itself from its original socialist rhetoric and proposals by 1998, a clearer shift did not occur until after Lula lost again that year and after Lula and his group had more fully digested the impact of Brazil&#x27;s changing political context and of Cardoso&#x27;s economic reforms.

During Lula&#x27;s fourth presidential run in 2002, the transition away from overt left-wing policies was fully cemented, and in a document known as the &quot;Letter to the Brazilian People&quot;, Lula committed himself and his party to the reform of taxes and pensions, and to promoting economic growth. He also accepted some of the liberal reforms from the Cardoso government, meaning that the party program was now &quot;de facto&quot; centre-left and social democratic in its ideology. Lula won the 2002 election in a landslide. However, some of the more left-wing factions of the party were critical of this turn toward the center and later left to form new left-wing parties like the Socialism and Liberty Party.

The party has a strong left-wing Catholic faction, and the Catholic left is considered the leading force behind the creation of the party, together with the Marxist left and &#x27;new unionism&#x27;. Catholic grassroots communities known as CEBs became widespread in Brazil and became the backbone of organization development of the PT in rural peripheries and rural areas, where the party relied on its Catholic faction to provide structural network. Whereas the party was considered a &#x27;vehicle&#x27; for social change, supportive Catholic communities were &quot;gasoline stations&quot;. The socialism of PT appealed to the Brazilian Catholic left, who was heavily influenced by liberation theology and believed that Marxism and Political Catholicism complemented one another. One of pro-PT Catholic priests, Frei Betto, declared in 1986: &quot;A real Christian is a communist, and a real communist a Christian.&quot;

Thanks to its large grassroots base, the Catholic left allowed PT to expand en masse and influenced the ideology of the party, as the Catholic factions provided meeting places for PT nuclei and engaged in &quot;political consciousness-raising&quot; amongst the rural population. Because of this, the pastoral work of the Catholic Church is considered to have been &quot;fundamental for the PT&#x27;s achieving a truly national character&quot;. One of the co-founders of PT, Hamilton Pereira, wrote that thanks to its Catholic origins, the party &quot;became a party that [brought] along the various expressions of Brazil&quot;. Lula also stated several times that the Catholic left played a more important role in the PT than trade unions. The Workers&#x27; Party was the only party in Brazil able to develop such close relations with the Catholic Church.

The PT is also influenced by liberation theology, considered an important factor in the creation of the party. Peter Flynn in the Third World Quarterly wrote that the party is closely linked to liberation theology, and its liberation Catholic faction was an important contribution towards the party&#x27;s victory in the 2002 Brazilian general election. The liberation theology faction of the party is also regularly included in the party&#x27;s cabinet appointment. Liberationist bishop Mauro Morelli served as president of the National Council for Food Security, and later became a political advisor of Lula. The PT mayor and Catholic lawyer Patrus Ananias became famous through his administration in Belo Horizonte, which became distinguished for its church-coordinated work against hunger and poverty. Liberation theologist Frei Betto also served as Lula&#x27;s special adviser, and the faction also played a crucial role in the education policy of the party and the 2010 anti-corruption &quot;clean slate&quot; law. Major liberation theology figures such as Leonardo Boff became supporters of the party. The PT&#x27;s close relationship with Brazil&#x27;s progressive Catholic Church continues to influence the rherotic of the party, with its politicians referring concepts from liberation theology.

==Electoral history==
===Presidential elections===
===Chamber of Deputies and Senate elections===

==Voter base==
Most of the Workers&#x27; Party votes in presidential elections since 2006 stems from the North and Northeast regions of Brazil. Nevertheless, the party has always won every presidential election in Rio de Janeiro from 1998 to 2014, the Federal District from 1989 to 2010 (with the exception in 1998 when Cardoso won there) and in Minas Gerais from 2002 to 2014 (these are two of the three largest states by number of voters and together they comprise 18.5% of voters). The party also maintains a stronghold in the southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul, where it has won continuously since the second round of 1989 until 2002.
Most of PT&#x27;s rejection comes from São Paulo as it has won elections there only once in 2002 (both rounds). The historical PT rejection in São Paulo was more widespread in interior than the capital as PT won the 1988, 2000 and 2012 São Paulo mayoral election and was a major force in his homeland, the Greater São Paulo. Despite this, the party lost its support even in the region and has not won any electoral zone in the capital in 2016 municipal elections. Fernando Haddad, the candidate seeking reelection, stayed in a distant second place, with 36 percentual points below the winner João Doria. PT managed to win in only one city of the region, the small and distant municipality of Franco da Rocha. PT is also strongly rejected in other states of the Center-South, such as Rio de Janeiro, which until 2018 had voted in the Workers Party presidential candidates in all new republic elections except 1994, the party shows strong difficulties to make representatives in federal, state and municipal levels. The party never elected a mayor in the capital of the state, never elected a governor (Benedita da Silva, the sole governor of the state from the party, took over because the resignation of the titular Anthony Garotinho in 2002, which her party had broken some years early, and was massive defeated in the same year&#x27;s election by the Garotinho&#x27;s wife Rosângela Matheus) and is often overturned in elections by left-wing parties with much less weight in national elections. The triumphs in the state were more associated with a strong rejection of PSDB in the state (which is even more weak and rejected despite his national strength) than a support of PT&#x27;s program. In 2018 presidential elections, PT lost in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo with similar percentages in both states, with a difference of only 0.02% less percent of valid votes to the party in São Paulo. Despite being a southeastern state, many regions of Minas Gerais, especially in the north region of the state, had strong economic, cultural and socially ties with the Northeast. São Francisco River, a symbol of the Northeast, has its source in a small city of Minas, Pirapora. With the exception of Rio Grande do Sul, Distrito Federal, and Espírito Santo PT never gets an elected governor in the Center-south until 2014, when Fernando Damata Pimentel was elected governor of Minas Gerais.

PT had a strong electoral stronghold in North Brazil and in the Amazonian region; The party triumphed in every state governorship in Acre from 1990 to 2018. However, the Acre section of the party is far more independent and moderate than the rest of the party and PT had only won the presidential election in the state twice in 2002 and 2006. PT also lost the governorship of Acre in 2018 to a candidate from right-wing Progressive Party. Roraima, which the impact of the controversy about the indigenous territory of Raposa Serra do Sol, which former President Lula gave strong support despite the opposition of the non-indigenous people; and Rondônia, which had a large population of evangelicals and south/southeastern migrants, also show reservations about the party. The electoral stronghold was also lost in 2018 elections; PT only triumphed in the states of Pará and Tocantins, the only states in the region which borders Brazilian Northeast and much of their culture is near from Northwest than the rest of Amazon. In Amazonas, the largest Brazilian states, PT lost in 2018 for the first time since 1998; PT lost in the capital of the state, Manaus, a free zone which concentrates more than the half of the population of the state; in the large, sparsely inhabited interior of the Amazonian state, PT win by a large margin but insufficient to guarantee the fifth triumph of the party in the state on presidential election.

PT, however, maintained and expanded his stronghold in Northeast Brazil, conquered in Lula first elections in 2002. Since 2002, the only time that a state other than these which did not vote in PT in a presidential election was Alagoas in both rounds of 2002 presidential elections. PT and its allies was able to make big gains in north and northeast regions of Brazil even in times which the party was in crisis, like in the last mayoral elections. PT&#x27;s most loyal party PCdoB and former allies Brazilian Socialist Party (&quot;Partido Socialista Brasileiro&quot; − PSB) and Democratic Labour Party (&quot;Partido Democrático Trabalhista&quot; − PDT) made huge gains in region together with PT in the Lula−Rousseff era. PCdoB is now the strongest party in Maranhão state and was able to elect the mayor of Aracaju, Sergipe; PSB is now the strongest party in the states of Pernambuco and Paraíba; and PDT was able to triumph in three capitals of the northeastern. Despite losing all capitals in northwest, PT had the governorships of three northwestern states, Piauí, Bahia and Ceará. The governorship of Bahia, conquered in 2006, is symbolical. The party was a stronghold of Liberal Front Party (&quot;Partido da Frente Liberal&quot; − PFL), now Democrats (&quot;Democratas&quot; − DEM), the greatest ideological rival of PT in national level. PSDB is a strongest party and headed all presidential tickets which PFL/DEM participated since 1994, but the origin of PSDB resembling with the origins PT as a leftist opposition to the dictatorship, and the parties had strong links until PSDB broke with PT and join in a coalition with PFL, a right-wing party with strong fiscal conservative views, associated with the Brazilian military regime in 1993 and the homeland of Antônio Carlos Magalhães, the strongest leadership of PFL and a fierce foe of PT. Bahia is now the main stronghold of PT, the most reliable state for the Petismo and is considered a governance model to the party. Despite this, the state&#x27;s capital Salvador is governed by ACM Neto, a leading member of DEM and grandson of Antonio Carlos Magalhães.

The party is often accused of exploiting the North–South divide in Brazil to gain votes in the northeast. The party denies the claims and accuses the opposition to do the same in the South and Southeast.

According to a poll conducted by IBOPE on 31 October 2010, during the second round voting PT&#x27;s candidate Dilma Rousseff had an overwhelming majority of votes among the poorest Brazilians. Her lead was of 26% among those who earned a minimum wage or less per month. Rousseff also had the majority of votes among Catholics (58%), blacks (65%) and mixed-race Brazilians (60%). Amongst whites and Protestants, she was statistically tie to José Serra and her lead was of only 4% on both demographic groups. Even though she was the first female candidate in a major party, her votes amongst men was wider than amongst women.

==Controversies==
===2003–2007 internal crisis and split===
The changes in the political orientation of PT (from a left-wing socialist to a centre-left social-democratic party) after Lula was elected president were well received by many in the population, but as a historically more radical party, the PT has experienced a series of internal struggles with members who have refused to embrace the new political positions of the party. These struggles have fueled public debates, the worst of which had its climax in December 2003, when four dissident legislators were expelled from the party for voting against Social Insurance Reform. Among these members were congressman João Batista Oliveira de Araujo (known as Babá) and senator Heloísa Helena, who formed the Socialism and Liberty Party (&quot;Partido Socialismo e Liberdade&quot; − PSOL) in June 2004 and ran for president in 2006, becoming at the time the woman who had garnered the most votes in Brazilian history.

In another move, 112 members of the radical wing of the party announced they were abandoning PT in the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre on 30 January 2005. They also published a manifesto entitled &quot;Manifesto of the Rupture&quot; that states that PT &quot;is no longer an instrument of social transformation, but only an instrument of the status quo&quot;, continuing with references to the International Monetary Fund and other economic and social issues.

===BANCOOP scandal===
This scandal, called the BANCOOP case, included João Vaccari Neto and four other directors of the housing cooperative. The cooperative received government contracts and had multi-million real revenue. The cooperative was found to have illegally padded the service contracts by 20%, with many of the contracts going unfulfilled. The cooperative eventually folded with a deficit of over R$100 million, requiring liquidation of assets to minimize the loss by members.

===2006 electoral scandal===
This scandal unfolded around September 2006, just two weeks before general elections. As a result, Berzoini left the coordination of Lula&#x27;s re-election after allegedly using PT&#x27;s budget (which is partially state-funded through party allowances) to purchase, from a confessed fraudster, a dossier that would be used to attack political adversaries. On 25 April 2007, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal unanimously cleared Lula of any responsibility for this scandal.

===Mensalão scandal===

In July 2005, members of the party suffered a sequence of corruption accusations, started by a deputy of the Brazilian Labour Party (&quot;Partido Trabalhista Brasileiro –&quot; PTB), Roberto Jefferson. Serious evidence for slush funding and bribes-for-votes were presented, dragging PT to the most serious crisis in its history, known colloquially as the &quot;Mensalão&quot;. José Genoíno resigned as president of the party and was replaced by Tarso Genro, former mayor of Porto Alegre. A small minority of party members defected as a result of the crisis. Most of them went to PSOL.

===Lava Jato scandal===
The investigation of a series of crimes, such corruption and money laundering, led to the arrest of the party&#x27;s treasurer João Vaccari Neto and his sister-in-law. José Genoino, José Dirceu, Delcídio do Amaral, André Vargas and Delúbio Soares were also arrested in the process. Most recently, former President Lula was arrested in April 2018. However, in March 2021, the Supreme Federal Court overturned all the convictions. This came after leaks which suggested that Judge Sérgio Moro had conspired with the prosecution.

<text>The European goldfinch or simply the goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis) is a small passerine bird in the finch family that is native to Europe, North Africa and western and central Asia. It has been introduced to other areas, including Australia, New Zealand, Uruguay and the United States.

The breeding male has a red face with black markings around the eyes, and a black-and-white head. The back and flanks are buff or chestnut brown. The black wings have a broad yellow bar. The tail is black and the rump is white. Males and females are very similar, but females have a slightly smaller red area on the face.

The goldfinch is often depicted in Italian Renaissance paintings of the Madonna and Child.

==Taxonomy==
The European goldfinch was one of the birds described and illustrated by Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in his &quot;Historiae animalium&quot; of 1555. The first formal description was by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; published in 1758. He introduced the binomial name, &quot;Fringilla carduelis&quot;. &quot;Carduelis&quot; is the Latin word for &#x27;goldfinch&#x27;. The European goldfinch is now placed in the genus &quot;Carduelis&quot; that was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 by tautonomy based on Linnaeus&#x27;s specific epithet. Modern molecular genetic studies have shown that the European goldfinch is closely related to the citril finch (&quot;Carduelis citrinella&quot;) and the Corsican finch (&quot;Carduelis corsicana&quot;).

The English word &#x27;goldfinch&#x27; was used in the second half of the 14th century by Geoffrey Chaucer in his unfinished &quot;The Cook&#x27;s Tale&quot;: &quot;Gaillard he was as goldfynch in the shawe (Gaily dressed he was as is a goldfinch in the woods)&quot;.

===Subspecies===
The subspecies of the European goldfinch are divided into two major groups. These intergrade at their boundary, so the groups are not recognized as distinct species despite their readily distinguishable plumage. Subspecies in the &quot;carduelis&quot; (black-crowned) group occupy the western part of the range and have black crowns; subspecies in the &quot;caniceps&quot; (grey-headed) group occupy the eastern part of the range and have grey heads.

== Phylogeny ==
The European goldfinch originated in the late Miocene-Pliocene and belongs to the clade of cardueline finches. The citril finch and the Corsican finch are its sister taxa. Their closest relatives are the greenfinches, crossbills and redpolls. The monophyly of the subfamily Carduelinae is suggested in previous studies.

== Description ==

The average European goldfinch is long with a wingspan of and a weight of . The sexes are broadly similar, with a red face, black and white head, warm brown upper parts, white underparts with buff flanks and breast patches, and black and yellow wings.

On closer inspection, male European goldfinches can often be distinguished by a larger, darker red mask that extends just behind the eye. The shoulder feathers are black, whereas they are brown on the female. In females, the red face does not extend past the eye. The ivory-coloured bill is long and pointed, and the tail is forked. Goldfinches in breeding condition have a white bill, with a greyish or blackish mark at the tip for the rest of the year. Juveniles have a plain head and a greyer back but are unmistakable due to the yellow wing stripe. Birds in central Asia (the &quot;caniceps&quot; group) have a plain grey head behind the red face, lacking the black and white head pattern of European and western Asian birds. Adults moult after the breeding season, with some individuals beginning in July and others not completing their moult until November. After moult birds appear less colourful, until the tips of the newly grown feathers wear away.

The song is a pleasant silvery twittering. The call is a melodic &#x27;, and the song is a pleasant tinkling medley of trills and twitters, but always including the tri-syllabic call phrase or a &#x27;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The European goldfinch is native to Europe, North Africa, and western and central Asia. It is found in open, partially wooded lowlands and is a resident in the milder west of its range, but migrates from colder regions. It will also make local movements, even in the west, to escape bad weather. 
It has been introduced to many areas of the world.
It was introduced to Bermuda, Canada, the United States, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Chile, the Falkland Islands, Uruguay, Brazil, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand in the 19th century, and their populations quickly increased and their range expanded greatly. In Australia, they now occur from Brisbane to the Eyre Peninsula, and are also spread throughout New Zealand. In the United States, they have become established in the western Great Lakes region.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Breeding===
The nest is built entirely by the female and is generally completed within a week. The male accompanies the female, but does not contribute. The nest is neat and compact and is generally located several metres above the ground, hidden by leaves in the twigs at the end of a swaying branch. It is constructed of mosses and lichens and lined with plant down such as that from thistles. It is attached to the twigs of the tree with spider silk. A deep cup prevents the loss of eggs in windy weather. Beginning within a couple of days after the completion of the nest, the eggs are laid in early morning at daily intervals. The clutch is typically 4–6 eggs, which are whitish with reddish-brown speckles. They have a smooth surface and are slightly glossy. The average size is with a calculated weight of . The eggs are incubated for 11–13 days by the female, who is fed by the male. The chicks are fed by both parents. Initially they receive a mixture of seeds and insects, but as they grow the proportion of insect material decreases. For the first 7–9 days the young are brooded by the female. The nestlings fledge 13–18 days after hatching. The young birds are fed by both parents for a further 7–9 days. The parents typically raise two broods each year and occasionally three.

===Feeding===

The European goldfinch&#x27;s preferred food is small seeds such as those from thistles (the Latin name is from &quot;Carduus&quot;, a genus of thistles), cornflowers, and teasels, but insects are also taken when feeding young. It also regularly visits bird feeders in winter. In the winter, European goldfinches group together to form flocks of up to 40, occasionally more. European goldfinches are attracted to back gardens in Europe and North America by birdfeeders containing  (commercially described as nyjer) seed. This seed of an annual from Africa is small, and high in oils. Special polycarbonate feeders with small oval slits at which the European goldfinches feed are sometimes used.

==Relationships with humans==
European goldfinches are commonly kept and bred in captivity around the world because of their distinctive appearance and pleasant song. If European goldfinches are kept with domestic canaries, they tend to lose their native song and call in favour of their cagemates&#x27; songs. This is considered undesirable, as it detracts from the allure of keeping European goldfinches. In Great Britain during the 19th century, many thousands of European goldfinches were trapped each year to be sold as cage birds. One of the earliest campaigns of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds was directed against this trade. Wildlife conservation attempts to limit bird trapping and the destruction of the open space habitats of European goldfinches.

Steglitz, a borough of the German city of Berlin is named after the European goldfinch. The surname Goldspink is based on the Scots word for the European goldfinch.

===Christian symbolism===
Because of the thistle seeds it eats, in Christian symbolism the European goldfinch is associated with Christ&#x27;s Passion and his crown of thorns. The European goldfinch, appearing in pictures of the Madonna and Christ child, represents the foreknowledge Jesus and Mary had of the Crucifixion. Examples include the &quot;Madonna del cardellino&quot; or &quot;Madonna of the Goldfinch&quot;, painted by the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael in about 1505–6, in which John the Baptist offers a European goldfinch to Christ in a warning of his future. In Barocci&#x27;s &quot;Holy Family&quot;, a European goldfinch is held in the hand of John the Baptist, who holds it high out of reach of an interested cat. In Cima da Conegliano&#x27;s &quot;Madonna and Child&quot;, a European goldfinch flutters in the hand of the Christ child. It is also an emblem of endurance, fruitfulness, and persistence. Because it symbolizes the Passion, the European goldfinch is considered a &quot;saviour&quot; bird and may be pictured with the common housefly (which represents sin and disease). The European goldfinch is also associated with Saint Jerome and appears in some depictions of him.

===Depictions in art===
Antonio Vivaldi composed a Concerto in D major for Flute &quot;Il Gardellino&quot; (RV 428, Op. 10 No. 3), where the singing of the European goldfinch is imitated by a flute. An anonymous Italian Neapolitan poem titled &quot;Il Cardellino&quot; was put to music by Saverio Mercadante and sung by Jose Carreras.

European goldfinches, with their &quot;wanton freak&quot; and &quot;yellow flutterings&quot;, are among the many natural &quot;luxuries&quot; that delight the speaker of John Keats&#x27; poem &#x27;I stood tip-toe upon a little hill...&#x27; (1816).

In the poem &quot;The Great Hunger&quot; by Patrick Kavanagh, the European goldfinch is one of the rare glimpses of beauty in the life of an elderly Irish farmer:

Donna Tartt&#x27;s novel &quot;The Goldfinch&quot; won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. A turning point in the plot occurs when the narrator, Theo, sees his mother&#x27;s favourite painting, Carel Fabritius&#x27;s &quot;The Goldfinch&quot;, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

<text>David Mather Masson (2 December 18226 October 1907), was a Scottish academic, supporter of women&#x27;s suffrage, literary critic and historian.

== Biography ==
Masson was born in Aberdeen, the son of Sarah Mather and William Masson, a stone-cutter.

He was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School under James Melvin and at Marischal College, University of Aberdeen. Intending to enter the Church, he proceeded to the University of Edinburgh where he studied theology under Thomas Chalmers. Masson remained friendly with Chalmers until his death 1847. However, abandoning his aspirations to the ministry, be returned to Aberdeen to undertake the editorship of the &quot;Banner&quot;, a weekly paper devoted to the advocacy of Free Kirk principles. After two years he resigned this post and went back to Edinburgh to pursue a purely literary career. There he wrote a great deal, contributing to &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot; (in which appeared his essays on Thomas Chatterton) and other periodicals. In 1847 he went to London, where he found a wider scope for his energy and knowledge.

He was a secretary of the Society of the Friends of Italy (1851–1852). In a famous interview with Elizabeth Barrett Browning at Florence, he contested her admiration for Napoleon III. He had known Thomas de Quincey, whose biography he contributed in 1878 to the &quot;English Men of Letters&quot; series, and he was an enthusiastic friend and admirer of Thomas Carlyle. In 1852 he was appointed a professor of English literature at University College, London, in succession to A H Clough, and for some years from 1858, he edited the newly established &quot;Macmillan&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. In 1865 he was selected for the chair of rhetoric and English literature at Edinburgh, and during the early years of his professorship actively promoted the movement for the university education of women. He also supported his wife Emily Rosaline Orme and two of their daughters in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, speaking at events in Edinburgh and London. In 1879 he became editor of the Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, and in 1886 gave the Rhind Lectures on that subject. In 1893 he was appointed Historiographer Royal for Scotland. Two years later he resigned his professorship. Shortly before he retired he became a member of the Scottish Arts Club. In 1896 he was President of the Edinburgh Sir Walter Scott Club and gave the Toast to Sir Walter at the club&#x27;s annual dinner. By 1900 he was Chairman of the Scottish History Society.

When he first arrived in Edinburgh in 1865, Masson lived in Rosebery Crescent, then he lived at 10 Regent Terrace from 1869 to 1882 before moving to Great King Street. Among the friends who visited him were the philosopher John Stuart Mill and the historian Thomas Carlyle. J.M. Barrie was a student of Masson in 1878–1882, and Masson is credited with being the future dramatist&#x27;s literary mentor.

A bust of Masson was presented to the Senate of the University of Edinburgh in 1897.

In 1900–1901 Masson is listed as living at 2 Lockharton Gardens in south-west Edinburgh (designed by Sir James Gowans).

He died in Edinburgh and is buried in the north-west section of Grange Cemetery in Edinburgh next to the main north path.

==Family==
In London on 17 August 1854, Masson married Emily Rosaline Orme, a noted campaigner for women&#x27;s suffrage in Scotland. Their son, David Orme Masson, became the first Professor of Chemistry at the University of Melbourne, and a KBE. Their daughter Rosaline was an author and novelist, and Flora Masson was a noted nurse and suffragist. Their third daughter Helen married Dr George Lovell Gulland.

His grandsons include the chemists John Masson Gulland (1898–1947) and James I. O. Masson.

==Recognition==

The Masson Hall of Residence–the university&#x27;s first &#x27;proper&#x27; accommodation for female students–in the Grange was named after him.

A building at the University of Edinburgh&#x27;s Pollock Halls of Residence is named after Masson. Built in the 1990s, Masson House is used as a three-star year-round hotel, rather than student accommodation.

==Works==

His &quot;magnum opus&quot; is his &quot;Life of Milton in Connexion with the History of His Own Time&quot; in six volumes, the first of which appeared in 1858 and the last in 1880. He also edited the library edition of &quot;Milton&#x27;s Poetical Works&quot; (3 vols., 1874), and &quot;De Quincey&#x27;s Collected Works&quot; (14 vols., 1889–1890). Among his other publications are

*&quot;The British Museum: Historical and Descriptive&quot; (1850)
*&quot;Essays, Biographical and Critical&quot; (1856, reprinted with additions, 3 vols., 1874)

<doc id="224631" wikidata="Q220228" url="?curid=224631" title="Abd al-Rahman ibn Abd Allah al-Ghafiqi">
<text>Abd al-Rahman ibn Abd Allah Al-Ghafiqi (; died 732), was an Arab Umayyad commander and governor who led Andalusian Muslim forces against the Franks. He is most famous for leading the Muslim forces during the Battle of Tours (also known as the Battle of Poitiers) in 732. This battle, fought against the Frankish forces led by Charles Martel, was a significant moment in European history as it marked the halting of the Muslim expansion into Western Europe.

Al-Ghafiqi was appointed as the governor of al-Andalus around 730 and led several successful military campaigns across the Pyrenees into Frankish territories where he was successful in sacking and capturing the city of Bordeaux, after defeating Duke Odo of Aquitaine in the battle outside the city, and then again defeating a second army of Duke Odo at the Battle of the River Garonne —where the western chroniclers state, &quot;God alone knows the number of the slain. His army advanced deep into modern-day France before being confronted by Charles Martel&#x27;s forces near the city of Tours. Al-Ghafiqi was killed in the battle, the Muslim forces retreated, and this event is often seen as a pivotal moment that preserved Christian rule in Western Europe.

Despite his defeat at Tours, al-Ghafiqi is remembered as a capable and ambitious military leader within the early history of Islamic expansion in Europe.

==Early years==
From the Arab Tihamite tribe of Ghafiq, he relocated to Ifriqiya (now Tunisia), then to the stretch of the Maghreb that is now Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Mauritania, where he became acquainted with Musa ibn Nusayr and his son Abd al-Aziz, the governors of al-Andalus.

==Battle of Toulouse==
Abd Al-Rahman took part in the Battle of Toulouse, where Al Samh ibn Malik was killed in 721 (102 AH) by the forces of Duke Odo of Aquitaine. After the severe defeat, he fled south along with other commanders and troops, and took over the command of Eastern Andalus. He was briefly relieved of his command, when Anbasa ibn Suhaym al-Kalbi was appointed in 721. After Anbasa died in 726 in southern Gaul, several successive commanders were put in place, none of whom lasted very long.

==Rebellion in Cerdanya==
In 730, the Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik appointed Abd Al-Rahman as &quot;wali&quot; (governor) of al-Andalus. David Levering Lewis describes him as &quot;intelligent, eloquent, and an accomplished administrator&quot;. On hearing that Uthman ibn Naissa, the Berber deputy governor of Catalunya, had concluded an alliance with duke Odo of Aquitaine, in order to set up an independent Catalunya for himself, the governor hurried to quell the rebellion. He engaged the Berber lord&#x27;s forces and killed him in 731. By some accounts, Uthman ibn Naissa killed himself.

==Battle of the River Garonne==

The wali assembled troops in Pamplona, called for recruits from Yemen and the Levant, and prepared to cross the Pyrenees into Gaul. Many arrived, and he crossed the Pyrenees range with an army composed primarily of Arabs. Emir Abd Al-Rahman made his way through Gascony and Aquitaine, according to one unidentified Arab, &quot;That army went through all places like a desolating storm,&quot; sacking and capturing the city of Bordeaux, after defeating Duke Odo of Aquitaine in battle outside the city, and then again defeating a second army of Duke Odo at the Battle of the River Garonne —where the western chroniclers state, &quot;God alone knows the number of the slain.&quot;
 Unlike Toulouse, where Odo had won by achieving complete surprise over the Muslim forces when he relieved the city in 721, this time his forces were forced to face the Muslim cavalry in open battle and were utterly destroyed. Also, the Muslim forces he had faced at the Battle of Toulouse were primarily light infantry and, while good fighters, were not remotely close to the caliber of the Arab cavalry brought by the Emir in this invasion.

==Battle of Tours==
Odo, with his remaining nobility, fled to Charles Martel, seeking help. Charles was campaigning on the Danube when news reached him. Martel had a seasoned professional infantry which had campaigned with him for many years and force-marched his army towards Acquitaine. In addition to the levies of militia the Franks normally called up to buttress their forces, he formed an army of Gauls and Germans approximately 30,000 strong. The invading forces, having no reason to believe the Franks were anything more than one of the various barbarian tribes that had ravaged Europe after Rome&#x27;s fall, failed to scout their strength in advance. They also misjudged Charles Martel, who was determined to prevent the expansion of the Caliphate over the Pyrenees into the heart of Christian Europe. This was a disastrous mistake which led to the defeat of Abd Al-Rahman in 732 near Poitiers, south of the river Loire.

The Frankish leader chose the battlefield. Moving his army over the mountains and avoiding the open roads, he escaped detection until positioning his men on a high, wooded plain. Martel had carefully chosen the battlefield, in large part knowing the hills and trees surrounding his position would greatly hinder the Muslim cavalry. For seven days, the two armies skirmished and maneuvered, with the Islamic forces recalling all their raiding parties, so that on the seventh day, their army was at full strength. Martel also received some reinforcements, though most historians agree he was badly outnumbered during the battle. Martel trained his men to fight in a large square, similar to the ancient Greek phalanx formation, to withstand the Muslim heavy cavalry. The Franks held their defensive formation all day, and repulsed repeated charges by the Muslim heavy cavalry.

According to Lewis, the Muslim soldiers were accompanied by their families. Wives and concubines were among the casualties. Realizing their camp was being plundered, a large contingent of Abd Al-Rahman&#x27;s forces broke off battle and returned to rescue their booty. Abd Al-Rahman was thus left exposed before the Frankish infantry and was killed in battle while attempting to rally his men. One reason for the defeat of the Muslim army was their preoccupation with war booty; another was the squabbles between various ethnic and tribal factions, which led to the surviving generals being unable to agree on a single commander to take Abd Al-Rahman&#x27;s place. Political factions, racial and ethnic rivalries, and personality clashes arose following his death. The varied nationalities and ethnicities present in an army drawn from all over the Caliphate, and the surviving generals, bickered among themselves, unable to agree on a commander to lead them the following day. The inability to select anyone to lead certainly contributed to the wholesale retreat of an army that was still dangerous.

==Aftermath==
Arab historians unanimously praise Abd Al-Rahman as a just and able administrator and commander, and bestow on him the honor of being the best governor of al-Andalus, where he did not take sides in the ethnic and tribal divisions that plagued al-Andalus under other rulers. Evidence of his irreplaceability as a ruler was demonstrated in the aftermath of his death at the Battle of Tours. Without his leadership and guidance, the other commanders were unable even to agree on a commander to lead them back into battle the following morning. Therefore, the effect of the death of Abd Al-Rahman on both Islamic and world history was profound.

His son attempted another invasion of Gaul under the Caliph&#x27;s instructions in 736, this time by sea. This naval invasion landed in Narbonne in 736 and moved at once to reinforce Muslim Arles and move inland. Charles again descended on the Provençal strongholds of the Muslims. In 736, he took Montfrin and Avignon, and Arles and Aix-en-Provence with the help of Liutprand, King of the Lombards. Nîmes, Agde and Béziers, held by Muslims since 725, also fell to him and their fortresses and probably the cities altogether were destroyed. He crushed one Muslim army at Arles, as that force sallied out of the city, and then took the city itself by a direct and frontal attack, and burned it to the ground to prevent its use again as a stronghold for Muslim expansion. He then moved swiftly and defeated a mighty host outside of Narbonne at the River Berre, but lacking siege machines was unable to take the city.

<doc id="224636" wikidata="Q193442" url="?curid=224636" title="Supersymmetry">
<text>Supersymmetry is a theoretical framework in physics that suggests the existence of a symmetry between particles with integer spin (&quot;bosons&quot;) and particles with half-integer spin (&quot;fermions&quot;). It proposes that for every known particle, there exists a partner particle with different spin properties. There have been multiple experiments on supersymmetry that have failed to provide evidence that it exists in nature. If evidence is found, supersymmetry could help explain certain phenomena, such as the nature of dark matter and the hierarchy problem in particle physics. 

A supersymmetric theory is a theory in which the equations for force and the equations for matter are identical. In theoretical and mathematical physics, any theory with this property has the &quot;principle of supersymmetry&quot; (SUSY). Dozens of supersymmetric theories exist. In theory, supersymmetry is a type of spacetime symmetry between two basic classes of particles: bosons, which have an integer-valued spin and follow Bose–Einstein statistics, and fermions, which have a half-integer-valued spin and follow Fermi–Dirac statistics. The names of bosonic partners of fermions are prefixed with &quot;s-&quot;, because they are scalar particles. For example, if the electron exists in a supersymmetric theory, then there would be a particle called a &quot;selectron&quot; (superpartner electron), a bosonic partner of the electron.

In supersymmetry, each particle from the class of fermions would have an associated particle in the class of bosons, and vice versa, known as a superpartner. The spin of a particle&#x27;s superpartner is different by a half-integer. In the simplest supersymmetry theories, with perfectly &quot;unbroken&quot; supersymmetry, each pair of superpartners would share the same mass and internal quantum numbers besides spin. More complex supersymmetry theories have a spontaneously broken symmetry, allowing superpartners to differ in mass.

Supersymmetry has various applications to different areas of physics, such as quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, quantum field theory, condensed matter physics, nuclear physics, optics, stochastic dynamics, astrophysics, quantum gravity, and cosmology. Supersymmetry has also been applied to high energy physics, where a supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model is a possible candidate for physics beyond the Standard Model. However, no supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model have been experimentally verified, and some physicists are saying the theory is dead.

== History ==
A supersymmetry relating mesons and baryons was first proposed, in the context of hadronic physics, by Hironari Miyazawa in 1966. This supersymmetry did not involve spacetime, that is, it concerned internal symmetry, and was broken badly. Miyazawa&#x27;s work was largely ignored at the time.

J. L. Gervais and B. Sakita (in 1971), Yu. A. Golfand and E. P. Likhtman (also in 1971), and D. V. Volkov and V. P. Akulov (1972), independently rediscovered supersymmetry in the context of quantum field theory, a radically new type of symmetry of spacetime and fundamental fields, which establishes a relationship between elementary particles of different quantum nature, bosons and fermions, and unifies spacetime and internal symmetries of microscopic phenomena. Supersymmetry with a consistent Lie-algebraic graded structure on which the Gervais−Sakita rediscovery was based directly first arose in 1971 in the context of an early version of string theory by Pierre Ramond, John H. Schwarz and André Neveu.

In 1974, Julius Wess and Bruno Zumino identified the characteristic renormalization features of four-dimensional supersymmetric field theories, which identified them as remarkable QFTs, and they and Abdus Salam and their fellow researchers introduced early particle physics applications. The mathematical structure of supersymmetry (graded Lie superalgebras) has subsequently been applied successfully to other topics of physics, ranging from nuclear physics, critical phenomena, quantum mechanics to statistical physics, and supersymmetry remains a vital part of many proposed theories in many branches of physics.

In particle physics, the first realistic supersymmetric version of the Standard Model was proposed in 1977 by Pierre Fayet and is known as the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model or MSSM for short. It was proposed to solve, amongst other things, the hierarchy problem.

Supersymmetry was coined by Abdus Salam and John Strathdee in 1974 as a simplification of the term super-gauge symmetry used by Wess and Zumino, although Zumino also used the same term at around the same time. The term supergauge was in turn coined by Neveu and Schwarz in 1971 when they devised supersymmetry in the context of string theory.

== Applications ==

=== Extension of possible symmetry groups ===
One reason that physicists explored supersymmetry is because it offers an extension to the more familiar symmetries of quantum field theory. These symmetries are grouped into the Poincaré group and internal symmetries and the Coleman–Mandula theorem showed that under certain assumptions, the symmetries of the S-matrix must be a direct product of the Poincaré group with a compact internal symmetry group or if there is not any mass gap, the conformal group with a compact internal symmetry group. In 1971 Golfand and Likhtman were the first to show that the Poincaré algebra can be extended through introduction of four anticommuting spinor generators (in four dimensions), which later became known as supercharges. In 1975, the Haag–Łopuszański–Sohnius theorem analyzed all possible superalgebras in the general form, including those with an extended number of the supergenerators and central charges. This extended super-Poincaré algebra paved the way for obtaining a very large and important class of supersymmetric field theories.

==== The supersymmetry algebra ====

Traditional symmetries of physics are generated by objects that transform by the tensor representations of the Poincaré group and internal symmetries. Supersymmetries, however, are generated by objects that transform by the spin representations. According to the spin-statistics theorem, bosonic fields commute while fermionic fields anticommute. Combining the two kinds of fields into a single algebra requires the introduction of a Z2-grading under which the bosons are the even elements and the fermions are the odd elements. Such an algebra is called a Lie superalgebra.

The simplest supersymmetric extension of the Poincaré algebra is the Super-Poincaré algebra. Expressed in terms of two Weyl spinors, has the following anti-commutation relation:
:formula_1
and all other anti-commutation relations between the &quot;Q&quot;s and commutation relations between the &quot;Q&quot;s and &quot;P&quot;s vanish. In the above expression are the generators of translation and &quot;σμ&quot; are the Pauli matrices.

There are representations of a Lie superalgebra that are analogous to representations of a Lie algebra. Each Lie algebra has an associated Lie group and a Lie superalgebra can sometimes be extended into representations of a Lie supergroup.

=== Supersymmetric quantum mechanics ===

&quot;Supersymmetric quantum mechanics&quot; adds the SUSY superalgebra to quantum mechanics as opposed to quantum field theory. Supersymmetric quantum mechanics often becomes relevant when studying the dynamics of supersymmetric solitons, and due to the simplified nature of having fields which are only functions of time (rather than space-time), a great deal of progress has been made in this subject and it is now studied in its own right.

SUSY quantum mechanics involves pairs of Hamiltonians which share a particular mathematical relationship, which are called &quot;partner Hamiltonians&quot;. (The potential energy terms which occur in the Hamiltonians are then known as &quot;partner potentials&quot;.) An introductory theorem shows that for every eigenstate of one Hamiltonian, its partner Hamiltonian has a corresponding eigenstate with the same energy. This fact can be exploited to deduce many properties of the eigenstate spectrum. It is analogous to the original description of SUSY, which referred to bosons and fermions. We can imagine a &quot;bosonic Hamiltonian&quot;, whose eigenstates are the various bosons of our theory. The SUSY partner of this Hamiltonian would be &quot;fermionic&quot;, and its eigenstates would be the theory&#x27;s fermions. Each boson would have a fermionic partner of equal energy.

==== In finance ====

In 2021, supersymmetric quantum mechanics was applied to option pricing and the analysis of markets in finance, and to financial networks.

=== Supersymmetry in quantum field theory ===
In quantum field theory, supersymmetry is motivated by solutions to several theoretical problems, for generally providing many desirable mathematical properties, and for ensuring sensible behavior at high energies. Supersymmetric quantum field theory is often much easier to analyze, as many more problems become mathematically tractable. When supersymmetry is imposed as a &quot;local&quot; symmetry, Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity is included automatically, and the result is said to be a theory of supergravity. Another theoretically appealing property of supersymmetry is that it offers the only &quot;loophole&quot; to the Coleman–Mandula theorem, which prohibits spacetime and internal symmetries from being combined in any nontrivial way, for quantum field theories with very general assumptions. The Haag–Łopuszański–Sohnius theorem demonstrates that supersymmetry is the only way spacetime and internal symmetries can be combined consistently.

While supersymmetry has not been discovered at high energy, see Section Supersymmetry in particle physics, supersymmetry was found to be effectively realized at the intermediate energy of hadronic physics where baryons and mesons are superpartners. An exception is the pion that appears as a zero mode in the mass spectrum and thus protected by the supersymmetry: It has no baryonic partner. The realization of this effective supersymmetry is readily explained in quark–diquark models: Because two different color charges close together (e.g., blue and red) appear under coarse resolution as the corresponding anti-color (e.g. anti-green), a diquark cluster viewed with coarse resolution (i.e., at the energy-momentum scale used to study hadron structure) effectively appears as an antiquark. Therefore, a baryon containing 3 valence quarks, of which two tend to cluster together as a diquark, behaves likes a meson.

=== Supersymmetry in condensed matter physics ===

SUSY concepts have provided useful extensions to the WKB approximation. Additionally, SUSY has been applied to disorder averaged systems both quantum and non-quantum (through statistical mechanics), the Fokker–Planck equation being an example of a non-quantum theory. The &#x27;supersymmetry&#x27; in all these systems arises from the fact that one is modelling one particle and as such the &#x27;statistics&#x27; do not matter. The use of the supersymmetry method provides a mathematical rigorous alternative to the replica trick, but only in non-interacting systems, which attempts to address the so-called &#x27;problem of the denominator&#x27; under disorder averaging. For more on the applications of supersymmetry in condensed matter physics see Efetov (1997).

In 2021, a group of researchers showed that, in theory, formula_2 SUSY could be realised at the edge of a Moore–Read quantum Hall state. However, to date, no experiments have been done yet to realise it at an edge of a Moore–Read state. In 2022, a different group of researchers created a computer simulation of atoms in 1 dimensions that had supersymmetric topological quasiparticles.

=== Supersymmetry in optics ===
In 2013, integrated optics was found to provide a fertile ground on which certain ramifications of SUSY can be explored in readily-accessible laboratory settings. Making use of the analogous mathematical structure of the quantum-mechanical Schrödinger equation and the wave equation governing the evolution of light in one-dimensional settings, one may interpret the refractive index distribution of a structure as a potential landscape in which optical wave packets propagate. In this manner, a new class of functional optical structures with possible applications in phase matching, mode conversion and space-division multiplexing becomes possible. SUSY transformations have been also proposed as a way to address inverse scattering problems in optics and as a one-dimensional transformation optics.

=== Supersymmetry in dynamical systems ===
All stochastic (partial) differential equations, the models for all types of continuous time dynamical systems, possess topological supersymmetry. In the operator representation of stochastic evolution, the topological supersymmetry is the exterior derivative which is commutative with the stochastic evolution operator defined as the stochastically averaged pullback induced on differential forms by SDE-defined diffeomorphisms of the phase space. The topological sector of the so-emerging supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics can be recognized as the Witten-type topological field theory.

The meaning of the topological supersymmetry in dynamical systems is the preservation of the phase space continuity—infinitely close points will remain close during continuous time evolution even in the presence of noise. When the topological supersymmetry is broken spontaneously, this property is violated in the limit of the infinitely long temporal evolution and the model can be said to exhibit (the stochastic generalization of) the butterfly effect. From a more general perspective, spontaneous breakdown of the topological supersymmetry is the theoretical essence of the ubiquitous dynamical phenomenon variously known as chaos, turbulence, self-organized criticality etc. The Goldstone theorem explains the associated emergence of the long-range dynamical behavior that manifests itself as noise, butterfly effect, and the scale-free statistics of sudden (instantonic) processes, such as earthquakes, neuroavalanches, and solar flares, known as the Zipf&#x27;s law and the Richter scale.

=== Supersymmetry in mathematics ===
SUSY is also sometimes studied mathematically for its intrinsic properties. This is because it describes complex fields satisfying a property known as holomorphy, which allows holomorphic quantities to be exactly computed. This makes supersymmetric models useful &quot;toy models&quot; of more realistic theories. A prime example of this has been the demonstration of S-duality in four-dimensional gauge theories that interchanges particles and monopoles.

The proof of the Atiyah–Singer index theorem is much simplified by the use of supersymmetric quantum mechanics.

=== Supersymmetry in string theory ===
Supersymmetry is an integral part of string theory, a possible theory of everything. There are two types of string theory, supersymmetric string theory or superstring theory, and non-supersymmetric string theory. By definition of superstring theory, supersymmetry is required in superstring theory at some level. However, even in non-supersymmetric string theory, a type of supersymmetry called misaligned supersymmetry is still required in the theory in order to ensure no physical tachyons appear. Any string theories without some kind of supersymmetry, such as bosonic string theory and the formula_3, formula_4, and formula_5 heterotic string theories, will have a tachyon and therefore the spacetime vacuum itself would be unstable and would decay into some tachyon-free string theory usually in a lower spacetime dimension. There is no experimental evidence that either supersymmetry or misaligned supersymmetry holds in our universe, and many physicists have moved on from supersymmetry and string theory entirely due to the non-detection of supersymmetry at the LHC.

Despite the null results for supersymmetry at the LHC so far, some particle physicists have nevertheless moved to string theory in order to resolve the naturalness crisis for certain supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model. According to the particle physicists, there exists a concept of &quot;stringy naturalness&quot; in string theory, where the string theory landscape could have a power law statistical pull on soft SUSY breaking terms to large values (depending on the number of hidden sector SUSY breaking fields contributing to the soft terms). If this is coupled with an anthropic requirement that contributions to the weak scale not exceed a factor between 2 and 5 from its measured value (as argued by Agrawal et al.), then the Higgs mass is pulled up to the vicinity of 125 GeV while most sparticles are pulled to values beyond the current reach of LHC. (The Higgs was determined to have a mass of 125 GeV ±0.15 GeV in 2022.) An exception occurs for higgsinos which gain mass not from SUSY breaking but rather from whatever mechanism solves the SUSY mu problem. Light higgsino pair production in association with hard initial state jet radiation leads to a soft opposite-sign dilepton plus jet plus missing transverse energy signal.

== Supersymmetry in particle physics ==

In particle physics, a supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model is a possible candidate for undiscovered particle physics, and seen by some physicists as an elegant solution to many current problems in particle physics if confirmed correct, which could resolve various areas where current theories are believed to be incomplete and where limitations of current theories are well established. In particular, one supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model, the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), became popular in theoretical particle physics, as the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model is the simplest supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model that could resolve major hierarchy problems within the Standard Model, by guaranteeing that quadratic divergences of all orders will cancel out in perturbation theory. If a supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model is correct, superpartners of the existing elementary particles would be new and undiscovered particles and supersymmetry is expected to be spontaneously broken.

There is no experimental evidence that a supersymmetric extension to the Standard Model is correct, or whether or not other extensions to current models might be more accurate. It is only since around 2010 that particle accelerators specifically designed to study physics beyond the Standard Model have become operational (i.e. the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)), and it is not known where exactly to look, nor the energies required for a successful search. However, the negative results from the LHC since 2010 have already ruled out some supersymmetric extensions to the Standard Model, and many physicists believe that the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, while not ruled out, is no longer able to fully resolve the hierarchy problem.

=== Supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model ===
Incorporating supersymmetry into the Standard Model requires doubling the number of particles since there is no way that any of the particles in the Standard Model can be superpartners of each other. With the addition of new particles, there are many possible new interactions. The simplest possible supersymmetric model consistent with the Standard Model is the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) which can include the necessary additional new particles that are able to be superpartners of those in the Standard Model.
One of the original motivations for the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model came from the hierarchy problem. Due to the quadratically divergent contributions to the Higgs mass squared in the Standard Model, the quantum mechanical interactions of the Higgs boson causes a large renormalization of the Higgs mass and unless there is an accidental cancellation, the natural size of the Higgs mass is the greatest scale possible. Furthermore, the electroweak scale receives enormous Planck-scale quantum corrections. The observed hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the Planck scale must be achieved with extraordinary fine tuning. This problem is known as the hierarchy problem.

Supersymmetry close to the electroweak scale, such as in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, would solve the hierarchy problem that afflicts the Standard Model. It would reduce the size of the quantum corrections by having automatic cancellations between fermionic and bosonic Higgs interactions, and Planck-scale quantum corrections cancel between partners and superpartners (owing to a minus sign associated with fermionic loops). The hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the Planck scale would be achieved in a natural manner, without extraordinary fine-tuning. If supersymmetry were restored at the weak scale, then the Higgs mass would be related to supersymmetry breaking which can be induced from small non-perturbative effects explaining the vastly different scales in the weak interactions and gravitational interactions.

Another motivation for the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model comes from grand unification, the idea that the gauge symmetry groups should unify at high-energy. In the Standard Model, however, the weak, strong and electromagnetic gauge couplings fail to unify at high energy. In particular, the renormalization group evolution of the three gauge coupling constants of the Standard Model is somewhat sensitive to the present particle content of the theory. These coupling constants do not quite meet together at a common energy scale if we run the renormalization group using the Standard Model. After incorporating minimal SUSY at the electroweak scale, the running of the gauge couplings are modified, and joint convergence of the gauge coupling constants is projected to occur at approximately 1016 GeV. The modified running also provides a natural mechanism for radiative electroweak symmetry breaking.

In many supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model, such as the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, there is a heavy stable particle (such as the neutralino) which could serve as a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter candidate. The existence of a supersymmetric dark matter candidate is related closely to R-parity. Supersymmetry at the electroweak scale (augmented with a discrete symmetry) typically provides a candidate dark matter particle at a mass scale consistent with thermal relic abundance calculations.

The standard paradigm for incorporating supersymmetry into a realistic theory is to have the underlying dynamics of the theory be supersymmetric, but the ground state of the theory does not respect the symmetry and supersymmetry is broken spontaneously. The supersymmetry break can not be done permanently by the particles of the MSSM as they currently appear. This means that there is a new sector of the theory that is responsible for the breaking. The only constraint on this new sector is that it must break supersymmetry permanently and must give superparticles TeV scale masses. There are many models that can do this and most of their details do not matter. In order to parameterize the relevant features of supersymmetry breaking, arbitrary soft SUSY breaking terms are added to the theory which temporarily break SUSY explicitly but could never arise from a complete theory of supersymmetry breaking.

===Searches and constraints for supersymmetry===
SUSY extensions of the standard model are constrained by a variety of experiments, including measurements of low-energy observables – for example, the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon at Fermilab; the WMAP dark matter density measurement and direct detection experiments – for example, XENON-100 and LUX; and by particle collider experiments, including B-physics, Higgs phenomenology and direct searches for superpartners (sparticles), at the Large Electron–Positron Collider, Tevatron and the LHC. In fact, CERN publicly states that if a supersymmetric model of the Standard Model &quot;is correct, supersymmetric particles should appear in collisions at the LHC.&quot;

Historically, the tightest limits were from direct production at colliders. The first mass limits for squarks and gluinos were made at CERN by the UA1 experiment and the UA2 experiment at the Super Proton Synchrotron. LEP later set very strong limits, which in 2006 were extended by the D0 experiment at the Tevatron. From 2003 to 2015, WMAP&#x27;s and Planck&#x27;s dark matter density measurements have strongly constrained supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model, which, if they explain dark matter, have to be tuned to invoke a particular mechanism to sufficiently reduce the neutralino density.

Prior to the beginning of the LHC, in 2009, fits of available data to CMSSM and NUHM1 indicated that squarks and gluinos were most likely to have masses in the 500 to 800 GeV range, though values as high as 2.5 TeV were allowed with low probabilities. Neutralinos and sleptons were expected to be quite light, with the lightest neutralino and the lightest stau most likely to be found between 100 and 150 GeV.

The first runs of the LHC surpassed existing experimental limits from the Large Electron–Positron Collider and Tevatron and partially excluded the aforementioned expected ranges. In 2011–12, the LHC discovered a Higgs boson with a mass of about 125 GeV, and with couplings to fermions and bosons which are consistent with the Standard Model. The MSSM predicts that the mass of the lightest Higgs boson should not be much higher than the mass of the Z boson, and, in the absence of fine tuning (with the supersymmetry breaking scale on the order of 1 TeV), should not exceed 135 GeV. The LHC found no previously unknown particles other than the Higgs boson which was already suspected to exist as part of the Standard Model, and therefore no evidence for any supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model.

Indirect methods include the search for a permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) in the known Standard Model particles, which can arise when the Standard Model particle interacts with the supersymmetric particles. The current best constraint on the electron electric dipole moment put it to be smaller than 10−28 e·cm, equivalent to a sensitivity to new physics at the TeV scale and matching that of the current best particle colliders. A permanent EDM in any fundamental particle points towards time-reversal violating physics, and therefore also CP-symmetry violation via the CPT theorem. Such EDM experiments are also much more scalable than conventional particle accelerators and offer a practical alternative to detecting physics beyond the standard model as accelerator experiments become increasingly costly and complicated to maintain. The current best limit for the electron&#x27;s EDM has already reached a sensitivity to rule out so called &#x27;naive&#x27; versions of supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model.

Research in the late 2010s and early 2020s from experimental data on the cosmological constant, LIGO noise, and pulsar timing, suggests it&#x27;s very unlikely that there are any new particles with masses much higher than those which can be found in the standard model or the LHC. However, this research has also indicated that quantum gravity or perturbative quantum field theory will become strongly coupled before 1 PeV, leading to other new physics in the TeVs.

===Current status===
The negative findings in the experiments disappointed many physicists, who believed that supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model (and other theories relying upon it) were by far the most promising theories for &quot;new&quot; physics beyond the Standard Model, and had hoped for signs of unexpected results from the experiments. In particular, the LHC result seems problematic for the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, as the value of 125 GeV is relatively large for the model and can only be achieved with large radiative loop corrections from top squarks, which many theorists consider to be &quot;unnatural&quot; (see naturalness and fine tuning).

In response to the so-called &quot;naturalness crisis&quot; in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, some researchers have abandoned naturalness and the original motivation to solve the hierarchy problem naturally with supersymmetry, while other researchers have moved on to other supersymmetric models such as split supersymmetry. Still others have moved to string theory as a result of the naturalness crisis. Former enthusiastic supporter Mikhail Shifman went as far as urging the theoretical community to search for new ideas and accept that supersymmetry was a failed theory in particle physics. However, some researchers suggested that this &quot;naturalness&quot; crisis was premature because various calculations were too optimistic about the limits of masses which would allow a supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model as a solution.

== General supersymmetry ==
Supersymmetry appears in many related contexts of theoretical physics. It is possible to have multiple supersymmetries and also have supersymmetric extra dimensions.

=== Extended supersymmetry ===
It is possible to have more than one kind of supersymmetry transformation. Theories with more than one supersymmetry transformation are known as extended supersymmetric theories. The more supersymmetry a theory has, the more constrained are the field content and interactions. Typically the number of copies of a supersymmetry is a power of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8...). In four dimensions, a spinor has four degrees of freedom and thus the minimal number of supersymmetry generators is four in four dimensions and having eight copies of supersymmetry means that there are 32 supersymmetry generators.

The maximal number of supersymmetry generators possible is 32. Theories with more than 32 supersymmetry generators automatically have massless fields with spin greater than 2. It is not known how to make massless fields with spin greater than two interact, so the maximal number of supersymmetry generators considered is 32. This is due to the Weinberg–Witten theorem. This corresponds to an &quot;N&quot; = 8 supersymmetry theory. Theories with 32 supersymmetries automatically have a graviton.

For four dimensions there are the following theories, with the corresponding multiplets (CPT adds a copy, whenever they are not invariant under such symmetry):

=== Supersymmetry in alternate numbers of dimensions ===
It is possible to have supersymmetry in dimensions other than four. Because the properties of spinors change drastically between different dimensions, each dimension has its characteristic. In &quot;d&quot; dimensions, the size of spinors is approximately 2&quot;d&quot;/2 or 2(&quot;d&quot; − 1)/2. Since the maximum number of supersymmetries is 32, the greatest number of dimensions in which a supersymmetric theory can exist is eleven.

===Fractional supersymmetry===
Fractional supersymmetry is a generalization of the notion of supersymmetry in which the minimal positive amount of spin does not have to be but can be an arbitrary for integer value of &quot;N&quot;. Such a generalization is possible in two or fewer spacetime dimensions.

<text>The Ice Hockey World Championships are an annual international men&#x27;s ice hockey tournament organized by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), first officially held at the 1920 Summer Olympics.
The IIHF was created in 1908 while the European Championships, the precursor to the World Championships, were first held in 1910. The tournament held at the 1920 Summer Olympics is recognized as the first Ice Hockey World Championship. From 1920 to 1968, the Olympic hockey tournament was also considered the World Championship for that year.

The first World Championship that was held as an individual event was in 1930 in which twelve nations participated. In 1931, ten teams played a series of round-robin format qualifying rounds to determine which nations participated in the medal round. Medals were awarded based on the final standings of the teams in the medal round. In 1951, thirteen nations took part and were split into two groups. The top seven teams (Pool A) played for the World Championship. The other six (Pool B) played for ranking purposes. This basic format would be used until 1992 (although small variations were made). During a congress in 1990, the IIHF introduced a playoff system. As the IIHF grew, more teams began to participate at the World Championships, so more pools (later renamed divisions) were introduced.

The modern format for the World Championship features 16 teams in the championship group, 12 teams in Division I, 12 teams in Division II and 12 teams in Division III. If there are more than 52 teams, the rest compete in Division IV. The teams in the championship play a preliminary round, then the top eight teams play in the playoff medal round and the winning team is crowned World Champion. Over the years, the tournament has gone through several rule changes. In 1969 body-checking in all three zones in a rink was allowed, helmets and goaltender masks became mandatory in the early 1970s and in 1992 the IIHF began using the shootout. The current IIHF rules differ slightly from the rules used in the NHL. From the 1920 Olympics until the 1976 World Championships, only athletes designated as &quot;amateur&quot; were allowed to compete in the tournament. Because of this, players from the National Hockey League (NHL) and its senior minor-league teams were not allowed to compete, while the Soviet Union was allowed to use permanent full-time players who were positioned as regular workers of an aircraft industry or tractor industry employer that sponsored what would be presented as an after-hours amateur social sports society team for their workers. In 1970, after an agreement to allow just a small number of its professionals to participate was rescinded by the IIHF, Canada withdrew from the tournament. Starting in 1977, professional athletes were allowed to compete in the tournament and Canada re-entered. The IIHF requires that players are citizens of the country they represent and allow players to switch national teams provided that they play in their new nation for a certain period of time.

Canada was the tournament&#x27;s first dominant team, winning the tournament 12 times from 1930 to 1952. The United States, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, Great Britain and Switzerland were also competitive during this period. The Soviet Union first participated in 1954 and soon became rivals with Canada. From 1963 until the nation&#x27;s breakup in 1991, the Soviet Union was the dominant team, winning 20 championships out of 26. During that period, only three other nations won medals: Canada, Czechoslovakia and Sweden. Russia first participated in 1992 and the Czechia and Slovakia began competing in 1993. In the 2000s, the competition became more open as the &quot;Big Six&quot; teams – Canada, the Czechia, Finland, Russia, Sweden, and the United States – have become more evenly matched.

As this tournament takes place during the same period as the later stages of the NHL&#x27;s Stanley Cup playoffs, many of that league&#x27;s top players are not available to participate for their national teams or have only become available after their NHL teams have been eliminated, after playing 90+ games. North American teams, and especially the United States, have been criticized for not taking this tournament seriously. For example, USA Hockey often sent teams made up of younger NHL players alongside college players, not using top level stars even when they are available.

The 2024 World Championship, held in Prague and Ostrava, Czechia, was the most successful to date in terms of overall attendance; it was visited by 797,727 people and average attendance was at 12,464.

==Background==
The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), the sport&#x27;s governing body, was created on 15 May 1908 under the name Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG). In 1908, organized ice hockey was still relatively new; the first organized indoor ice hockey game took place on 3 March 1875 at Montreal&#x27;s Victoria Skating Rink. In 1887, four clubs from Montreal formed the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) and developed a structured schedule. Lord Stanley donated the Stanley Cup and the trustees decided to award it to either the best team in the AHAC, or to any pre-approved team that won it in a challenge. The Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA) was formed in 1905, which mixed paid and amateur players in its rosters. The ECAHA eventually folded and as a result of the dissolution, the National Hockey Association (NHA) formed.

The Ice Hockey European Championships, first held in Les Avants, Switzerland in January 1910, was the first official hockey tournament for national teams. Participating nations in the inaugural event were Great Britain, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. In North America, professional hockey was continuing to grow, the National Hockey League (NHL), the largest professional hockey league in the world, was formed in 1917. The European Championships were held for five consecutive years but were not held from 1915 to 1920 due to World War I. The LIHG Championships, held between 1911 and 1914, is also considered a precursor to the World Championships, though the competition did not gain as much importance at the time.

==History==
===1920–1928: Olympic Games===
The IIHF considers the ice hockey tournament held at the 1920 Summer Olympics to be the first Ice Hockey World Championship. It was organized by a committee that included future IIHF president Paul Loicq. The tournament was played from 23 to 29 April. Seven teams participated: Canada, Czechoslovakia, the United States, Switzerland, Sweden, France and Belgium. Canada, represented by the Winnipeg Falcons, won the gold medal, outscoring opponents 27–1. The United States and Czechoslovakia won the silver and bronze medals respectively. Following the 1921 Olympic Congress in Lausanne, the first Winter Olympics were held in 1924 in Chamonix, France, though they were only officially recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as such in the following year.

Subsequently, every Olympic tournament up to and including the 1968 Winter Olympics is counted as the World Championship. Canada won the gold medal at both the 1924 and 1928 Winter Olympics. In 1928, the Swedish and Swiss teams won their first medals–silver and bronze, respectively–and a German team participated for the first time, finishing ninth.

===1930–1953: Canadian dominance===
The first World Championship that was held as an individual event was in 1930. It was held in Chamonix, France; Vienna, Austria; and Berlin, Germany. Canada, represented by the Toronto CCMs, defeated Germany in the gold medal game, and Switzerland won the bronze. Canada, represented by the Manitoba Grads, won the following year, and the Winnipeg Winnipegs won Gold for Canada at the 1932 Winter Olympics. At the 1933 World Championships in Prague, Czechoslovakia, the United States won the gold medal, becoming the first non-Canadian team to win the competition. As of 2023, it is the only gold medal the United States has won at a non-Olympic tournament.
Two days before the 1936 Winter Olympics in Germany, Canadian officials protested that two players on the British team—James Foster and Alex Archer—had played in Canada but transferred without permission to play for clubs in the English National League. The IIHF agreed with Canada, but Britain threatened to withdraw if the two could not compete. Canada withdrew the protest before the games started. Britain became the first non-Canadian team to win Olympic gold, with the United States taking bronze. Canada won the remainder of the World Championship tournaments held in the 1930s. The 1939 World Championships marked the first time that a team from Finland competed in the tournament. World War II forced the cancellation of the 1940 and 1944 Winter Olympics and the World Championships from 1941 to 1946.
Following World War II, Czechoslovakia&#x27;s team was quickly improving. They won the 1947 World Championships, although a Canadian team had not participated in the event. In 1949, they became the third nation to win a World Championship tournament that Canada participated in. During the run-up to the 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, Switzerland, a conflict broke out with the two American hockey bodies: the American Hockey Association (AHA, a forerunner to USA Hockey) and the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU). The AAU refused to support the AHA&#x27;s team because they believed that AHA players were &quot;openly paid salaries&quot; and at the time, the Olympics were strictly for amateur players. A compromise was reached that the AHA team would be allowed to compete but would be considered unofficial and unable to win a medal. By the end of the tournament, the AHA team finished fourth in the standings. Both Czechoslovakia and the RCAF Flyers of Canada won seven games and tied when they played each other. The gold medal winner was determined by goal average: Canada won the gold because they had an average of 13.8 compared to Czechoslovakia&#x27;s average of 4.3.

At the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, Norway, the Edmonton Mercurys won Canada&#x27;s second consecutive Olympic gold medal and their 15th World Championship in 19 competitions. It was the last time that a Canadian team would win an Olympic gold medal in hockey for 50 years. At the 1953 tournament, reigning champion Canada did not attend, while the team from Czechoslovakia withdrew because of the death of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, leaving only Sweden, West Germany, and Switzerland competing in the top division. Sweden finished the tournament undefeated and won their first World Championship.

===1954–1962: Canada–Soviet Union rivalry===


The 1954 World Championships has been described by the IIHF as &quot;the start of the modern era of international hockey.&quot; The tournament saw the first participation of the Soviet Union in international competition. The Soviet Union had organized its first ice hockey league in 1946, having previously focused on bandy. Led by coach Arkady Chernyshev, the Soviet national team finished their first six games undefeated. Canada, represented by the East York Lyndhursts, was also undefeated and, in the final game of the tournament, the two teams met for the first time in international competition. The Soviet Union won the game 7–2, becoming the fifth team to win a World Championship tournament. The 1955 World Championship was held in West Germany, and the two teams again met in the final game of the tournament. The game was so high profile in Canada that announcer Foster Hewitt flew to West Germany to provide play-by-play coverage. Both teams were undefeated and Canada, represented by the Penticton Vees, defeated the Soviets 5–0 to reclaim the World Championship. At the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, Italy, Canada&#x27;s Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen lost to both the Soviets and the United States in the medal round and won the bronze. The Soviets went undefeated and won their first Olympic ice hockey gold medal. It would be seven years until the Soviet Union won another World Championship.

The 1957 World Championships were held in Moscow. Canada and the United States did not participate in protest of the Soviet occupation of Hungary. Most of the games were held in the Luzhniki Sports Palace, but the Soviet officials decided to hold the final game in a nearby outdoor soccer stadium. The game was attended by at least 55,000 people, which stood as a World Championship attendance record until 2010. In the final game, Sweden edged the Soviet Union to finish with six wins and one tie (the Soviet Union had five wins and two ties) and won the gold medal. Canada returned to the World Championship in 1958 and won two consecutive titles, with the Soviets winning silver both times. At the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, California, Canada, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Sweden were the top four teams heading into the Games. All four were defeated by the American team, which won all seven games en route to its first Olympic gold medal.

In 1961, Czechoslovakia defeated the Soviet Union and tied Canada to make it a three-way race for gold. In the final game, Canada defeated the Soviets 5–1 to win their nineteenth gold medal. The Trail Smoke Eaters became the final club team to represent Canada. The following year, Canada implemented a national team program, led by Father David Bauer. Canada would not win another world championship gold until 1994. In 1962, the World Championships were held in North America for the first time. The tournament was held in Denver, United States, and was boycotted by the Soviet and Czechoslovak teams. Sweden defeated Canada for the first time in the history of the competition and won their third gold medal.

===1963–1976: Soviet dominance===

At the 1963 World Championships in Stockholm, the Soviet Union won the gold medal, beginning a streak of nine consecutive World Championship golds. The 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria marked the first time that Canada failed to win an Olympic medal in hockey. The Soviet Union won all seven of their games and the gold medal, but Canada finished the tournament with five wins and two losses, putting them in a three-way tie for second place with Sweden and Czechoslovakia. Prior to 1964, the tie-breaking procedure was based on goal difference from games against teams in the medal round and under that system, Canada would have placed third ahead of the Czechoslovaks. The procedure had been changed to count all games and that meant the Canadians finished fourth. However, the Olympics also counted as the World Championships, and under IIHF rules, Canada should have won a World Championship bronze. In April 2005, the IIHF admitted that a mistake had occurred and announced that they had reviewed the decision and would award the 1964 Canadian team a World Championship bronze medal. However, two months later, the IIHF over-turned their decision and rejected an appeal in September.

The Soviets dominated the remainder of the decade. Following 1963, the team went undefeated in Olympic and World Championship competition for four years. Their streak was broken by Czechoslovakia at the 1968 Winter Olympics. Despite the loss, the Soviets still won gold. It was the last time that the Olympics were also counted as the World Championships. In 1969, the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia played &quot;the most emotionally charged games in the history of international hockey.&quot; The rights to host the tournament had originally been awarded to Czechoslovakia but they were forced to decline the rights following the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion of the nation in August 1968. The tournament was held in Stockholm, Sweden, and with these international tensions, the Czechoslovak team was determined to defeat the Soviets. They won both of their games 2–0 and 4–3 but despite these wins, the Czechoslovaks lost both of their games to Sweden and won bronze.

With European teams using their best players who are de facto professionals, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) felt their amateur players could no longer be competitive and pushed for the ability to use players from professional leagues. At the IIHF Congress in 1969, the IIHF voted to allow Canada to use nine non-NHL professional players at the 1970 World Championships. The rights to host the tournament were awarded to Canada for the first time–in Montreal and Winnipeg. However, the decision to allow the use of professionals was reversed in January 1970. IOC president Avery Brundage was opposed to the idea of amateur and professional players competing together and said that ice hockey&#x27;s status as an Olympic sport would be in jeopardy if the change was made. In response, Canada withdrew from International ice hockey competition. Canada&#x27;s ice hockey team did not participate in the 1972 and 1976 Winter Olympics. Canada also waived their rights to host the 1970 World Championship, so it was held in Stockholm, Sweden instead.

Led by goaltender Vladislav Tretiak and forwards Valeri Kharlamov, Alexander Yakushev, Vladimir Petrov and Boris Mikhailov, the Soviet Union won gold at the 1970 and 1971 World Championships and the 1972 Winter Olympics. 1972 marked the first time that both the Olympics and World Championships were held in the same year as separate events. At the World Championships in Prague, the Czechoslovak team ended the Soviet team&#x27;s streak and won their first gold since 1949. The Soviet team quickly returned to their winning ways, winning 1973 and 1974 World Championships. However, during the latter tournament, the Czechoslovak team defeated the Soviets 7–2. It was one of the biggest margins the Soviet team had ever lost by in an official game. The 1976 World Championships were held in Katowice, Poland. On the opening day of the tournament, Poland defeated the Soviet Union 6–4 thanks to a hat-trick from forward Wieslaw Jobczyk and the goaltending of Andrzej Tkacz. It was one of the biggest upsets in international hockey history; two months earlier at the 1976 Winter Olympics, Poland had lost 16–1 to the Soviets. The Soviets lost two more games and won the silver, and Czechoslovakia won gold. Poland finished seventh and was relegated to Pool B, the division in which teams play for ranking purposes and not the championship (now known as Division I).

===1976–1987: First years of open competition===
Günther Sabetzki became president of the IIHF in 1975 and helped to resolve the dispute with the CAHA. The IIHF agreed to allow &quot;open competition&quot; of all players in the World Championships, and moved the competition to later in the season so players not involved in the NHL playoffs could participate. However, NHL players were still not allowed to play in the Olympics, because of both the unwillingness of the NHL to take a break mid-season and the IOC&#x27;s strict amateur-only policy. The IIHF also agreed to endorse the Canada Cup, a competition meant to bring together the best players from the top hockey-playing countries.

The 1976 World Ice Hockey Championships in Katowice were the first to feature professionals although in the end only the United States made use of the new rule, recalling eight pros from the NHL&#x27;s Minnesota North Stars and the WHA&#x27;s Minnesota Fighting Saints. The first fully open World Championship was held in 1977 in Vienna, Austria, and saw the first participation of active Canadian NHL players, including two-time NHL MVP Phil Esposito. Sweden and Finland also augmented their rosters with a few NHL and WHA players. Many of the players on the Canadian team were not prepared for the tournament and were unfamiliar with the international game. The team finished fourth, losing both games to the Soviet Union by a combined score of 19–2. Czechoslovakia won gold, becoming the third team (after Canada and the Soviet Union) to win consecutive championships.

As a result of these events, full world championship status was given to the IIHF World Under-20 Championship, which had been held annually since 1974 as an unofficial invitational tournament. Colloquially known as the World Junior Ice Hockey Championship, the event was structured after the World Championships, but limited to players under the age of 20. The World Under-18 Championship was established in 1999 and typically held in April. It usually does not involve some of the top North American-based players because they are involved in junior league playoffs at the time.

Starting in 1978, the Soviet team won five consecutive World Championships, and had an unbeaten streak that
lasted from 1981 through the 1984 Winter Olympics and until 1985. During that period, Canada remained competitive, winning three bronze medals. World Championship tournaments were
not held in 1980, 1984 or 1988–the Olympic years.

The 1987 World Championships in Vienna were over-shadowed by several controversies. At the beginning of the tournament, the roster of the West German team included Miroslav Sikora, a Polish-German forward who had previously played for Poland at the 1977 World Under-20 Championship. Sikora became a naturalized citizen of West Germany and played in the first three games, scoring a goal in a 3–1 win over Finland. Following the game, Finland launched a protest, demanding that the result be over-turned because the West Germans had used an
ineligible player. At the time, players were not allowed to switch nationalities under any circumstances and the IIHF agreed to overturn the result and award the two points to Finland. This angered West German officials, who filed a protest in an Austrian court. The court agreed with the West Germans, overturning the IIHF decision and allowing them to keep their points. The result affected the final standings because had the IIHF&#x27;s decision stood, Finland would have advanced to the medal round instead of Sweden. However, the Finns finished out of the medal round, and Sweden won their first gold medal since 1962. The tournament format also became controversial because the Soviet Union finished undefeated in the preliminary round but the Swedish team, which had lost three games in the preliminary round, won on goal differential because of a 9–0 win over Canada in the medal round.

===1989–1992: Fall of the Iron Curtain===

Before 1989, players that lived in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and other nations behind the Iron Curtain were not allowed to leave and play in the NHL. In March 1989, Sergei Pryakhin became the first member of the Soviet national team who was permitted to play for a non-Soviet team. Several Soviet players, including Igor Larionov and Viacheslav Fetisov, wanted to leave and play in the NHL. Soviet officials agreed to allow players to leave if they played one final tournament with the national team. Players agreed to this, and the Soviet Union won its 21st World Championship. Shortly after, Soviet players began to flood into the NHL. Many of the Soviet Union&#x27;s top players left, including the entire &quot;Green Unit&quot;–Larionov, Fetisov, Vladimir Krutov, Sergei Makarov and Alexei Kasatonov. The following year, the Soviet team won their final title at the 1990 World Championships. In 1991, Swedish forward Mats Sundin–the first European player to be drafted first overall in the NHL–led his team to the gold medal. The Soviets won bronze–the last medal the team would ever win.

The Soviet Union dissolved in December 1991. Nine former Soviet republics became part of the IIHF and began competing in international competitions, including Belarus, Kazakhstan, Latvia (which returned after a 52-year-long absence due to having been occupied by the Soviet Union) and Ukraine; the largest, Russia, succeeded the USSR. With this flood of new teams, the IIHF expanded the number of spots from eight to twelve. From 1963 to 1991, only four teams won a World Championship medal: the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia (failing to win a medal only three times), Sweden and Canada. The Soviets won a medal in every tournament they participated in (1954 to 1991). At the 1992 World Championships, Sweden won their second consecutive gold. Finland won the silver medal, the nation&#x27;s first ever World Championship medal (the Finnish team had previously won a silver at the 1988 Winter Olympics).

===1993–present===
Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in January 1993. The IIHF recognized the Czech Republic&#x27;s team as the successor to Czechoslovakia, and it retained its position in the top division while Slovakia&#x27;s team began in the lowest division (Pool C) in 1994 and was forced to work its way up. Following this, the next decade was dominated by the so-called &quot;Big Six&quot;–Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, Sweden and the United States. From 1992 to 1996, five different teams won the World Championship. At the 1993 World Championships, Russia won its first title as an independent nation and the Czech Republic won its first medal (bronze). In 1994, the Canadian team finished the preliminary round undefeated and defeated Finland in the final to win their first World Championship since 1961. The following year in Sweden, the Finnish team won its first ever World Championship. Led by their top line of Saku Koivu, Ville Peltonen and Jere Lehtinen, the Finns defeated rival Sweden in the gold medal game. At the 1995 Pool B championships, Slovakia, led by Peter Šťastný won Pool B and was promoted to the top division, where it has remained ever since. In 1996, the Czech Republic won its first World Championship as a separate country. During this period, the United States was the only one of the &quot;Big Six&quot; not to win the World Championship, although they did win the 1996 World Cup of Hockey and their bronze at that year&#x27;s World Championship was their first medal since 1962. In the mid-1990s, several new teams such as Slovakia, Latvia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine were quickly improving and older nations such as Austria, France, Italy, Norway and Switzerland were at risk of being relegated to Pool B. The IIHF feared that it would lose advertising revenue if that happened, so the number of teams was increased to 16 starting in 1998.

From 1996 to 2001, the Czech Republic won six consecutive World Championship medals, including World Championship gold from 1999 to 2001, as well as gold at the 1998 Winter Olympics. In 2002, the Czechs were favoured to win, but were upset in the quarter final by Russia. In the gold medal game between Russia and Slovakia, Slovakian Peter Bondra scored in the final two minutes of the game and the nation won its first ever World Championship. At the 2003 World Championships, Sweden made one of the biggest comebacks in tournament history, rallying from a 5–1 deficit in their quarterfinal game against Finland to win 6–5. The gold medal game between Canada and Sweden went into overtime. Canada&#x27;s Anson Carter scored the winning goal 13 minutes into play, but the goal had to be reviewed for ten minutes to determine if the puck had crossed the line. In a rematch of the two nations the following year, Canada won and repeated as champions.
The 2004–05 NHL season was locked out, and eventually cancelled, because of a labour dispute between the league and the players. The 2005 World Championships, which featured more top players than normal, was won by the Czech Republic. At the 2006 Winter Olympics, Sweden won the gold medal over Finland. Three months later, Sweden defeated the Czech Republic and won the 2006 World Championships. They became the first team to win Olympic gold and a separate World Championship tournament in the same year. At the 2007 World Championship in Moscow, Canada defeated Finland to win the gold medal. The following year, the tournament was held in Canada for the first time. Russia defeated the home team to win their first gold medal since 1993. The Russian team successfully defended their title with a 2–1 win over Canada in 2009.
In 2009, NHL Players&#x27; Association director Paul Kelly suggested that the World Championships be held every other year and that the NHL go on break to allow full player participation. IIHF president René Fasel responded that the tournament has television contracts and hosting commitments and that a large change would be difficult to put in place.

The 2010 tournament took place in Germany. The first game, between Germany and the United States, was played at Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen and was attended by 77,803 people, setting a new record for the most attended game in hockey history. The tournament was noted for having several surprising preliminary round results, including: Switzerland beating Canada for the first time in World Championship play; Norway defeating eventual champions the Czech Republic; and Denmark upsetting Finland and the United States en route to their first ever quarterfinal appearance. The German team, which had finished 15th in 2009 and only avoided relegation to Division I because they were set to host the 2010 tournament, advanced to the semi-finals for the first time since the new playoff format was adapted. They finished fourth, losing to Sweden in the bronze medal game. In the gold medal game, the Czech Republic defeated the Russian team, winning gold.
The 2011 tournament was held in independent Slovakia for the first time. Finland won its second world championship with a 6–1 victory over Sweden. The Czech Republic won the bronze medal over Russia.

The 2012 tournament was held in Sweden and Finland. Russia beat Slovakia in the final, while the Czech Republic beat Finland in the bronze medal game.

In 2013, Switzerland finished the preliminary round undefeated before losing the gold medal game 5–1 to co-hosts Sweden. Switzerland&#x27;s silver medal was the first for the nation since 1953. Sweden&#x27;s gold made them the first team to win the tournament at home since the Soviet Union in 1986.

The 2014 tournament was held for the first time in independent Belarus in spite of concerns of the human rights abuses perpetrated by the authoritarian government. The tournament saw more upsets by the less prominent ice-hockey nations. France had beaten Canada for the second time in the modern history and made it to the quarterfinals. Eventual finalist Finland lost to Latvia and made it to the quarterfinals only due to a shootout win over Switzerland. The tournament was won by Russia (which had a stacked NHL squad compared to other teams who sent in younger players after the 2014 Winter Olympics), Finland won silver and Sweden won bronze defeating the Czech Republic.

The 2015 tournament was held in Prague and Ostrava, it was the most attended championship in history. It was to be the last appearance of Jaromír Jágr on the Czech national hockey team, and the home crowd had great expectations for its national team, who had failed to win a gold medal since 2010, matching its longest run without a win since the break-up of Czechoslovakia. However, the tournament was dominated by an excellent Canadian team, which went undefeated and beat Russia 6–1 in the gold medal match. Its captain, Sidney Crosby joined the Triple Gold Club, becoming the first player to achieve that honour as captain of each winning team. The bronze was won by the United States, leaving the Czechs with a second consecutive fourth place.
The 2020 tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Tournament structure==
===History===

The first World Championship to be held as an individual event was in 1930. Twelve different nations participated. Canada&#x27;s team was given a bye to the gold medal game, and the rest of the nations played an elimination tournament to determine which nation would also play for the gold.

In 1931, the World Championships switched to a similar format to what was used at the Olympics. Ten teams played series of round-robin format qualifying rounds were played to determine which nations participated in the medal round. Medals were awarded based on the final standings of the teams in the medal round. The format was changed several times in the 1930s, in some years there was a gold medal game, while in others the gold medal was awarded based on points.

In 1937, the tournament format was again switched to being similar to the version used at the Olympics. A preliminary round involving 11 teams was played, then the top four advanced to the medal round and medals were awarded based on points; no gold medal game was played. A gold medal game was played in 1938; it was the last gold medal game played in the World Championships until 1992.

In 1951, thirteen nations took part and were split into two groups. The top seven teams (Pool A) played for the World Championship. The other six (Pool B) played for ranking purposes. Generally eight teams played in the top-level Championship, although the number varied over the years, going as low as three (in 1953) and as high as twelve (in 1959). The same format was used until 1992. The format was criticized because often the gold medal winner was decided before the final game was played, such as at the 1988 Winter Olympics.

During a congress in 1990, the IIHF introduced a playoff system.

As the IIHF grew, more teams began to participate at the World Championships, so more pools were introduced. Pool C games were first played in 1961 and Pool D was introduced in 1987. In 2001, the pools were renamed: Pool B became Division I, Pool C became Division II and Pool D became Division III.

===Modern Champion Group, Division I, II and III format===
The modern format for the World Championship features a minimum of 52 teams: 16 teams in the main championship group, 12 teams in Division I, 12 teams in Division II and 12 teams in Division III. If there are more than 52 teams, the rest compete in Division IV.

From 2000 to 2011, the teams were divided into four groups and played each other in a round robin format preliminary round, and the top 3 teams in each group advance into the qualifying round. The qualifying round is another round of group play with two groups of six, with the top four teams in each group advancing into the knockout playoff stage. The bottom four teams in the preliminary round played in another group as well; this group determined relegation. After a round-robin format, the bottom two teams were usually relegated to play in Division I the following year.

From 1998 and 2004, the IIHF held a &quot;Far East&quot; qualifying tournament for Asian teams with an automatic berth in the championship division on the line. Japan always won this tournament, but finished last at every World Championship except in 2004, when they finished 15th. The IIHF discontinued the qualifying tournament following the 2004 tournament, and Japan was relegated to compete in Division I.

===Champion group format from 2012===
The main group features 16 teams. The 16 teams are split into two groups based on their world ranking. The ranking is based on the standings of the last Winter Olympics and the last four World Championships. The results of more recent tournaments have a higher weight in the ranking. The last World Championship has 100% value, the tournament before 75% and so on. The Olympic tournament has the same value as the World Championship the same year.

Beginning with the 2012 tournament, the qualifying round was eliminated, and the 16 teams divided into two groups of eight, with each team playing seven games in the preliminary round.

The top four teams from these groups advanced to the knockout playoff stage. In the quarterfinals, the first place team from one group played the fourth place team from the opposite group, and the second place team from one group played the third place team from the opposite group. The winners advanced to the semi-finals. In cases where the quarter-final venues were deemed too far apart to allow easy travel between them, the teams stayed within their groups for the quarters. The winners of the quarter-finals advanced to the semi-finals, with the winners of the semi-finals advancing to the gold medal game and the losers advancing to the bronze medal game.

Also starting in 2012, the relegation round was eliminated. Instead, the eighth-place team in each group was relegated to Division I.

===Division I, II and III formats from 2012===
Division I is split into two groups of six, both groups play in round robin tournaments independent of each other and the championship division. Previously the top team from both groups was promoted to the championship, while the bottom team was relegated to Division II. Beginning in 2012, the top two teams from the &#x27;A&#x27; group were promoted to the championship, the bottom team was exchanged with the group &#x27;B&#x27; winner, and that group&#x27;s last place team was sent to Division II.

Division II works similarly to Division I, with two six-team groups where group &#x27;A&#x27; promotes one team to Division I and group &#x27;B&#x27; exchanges its last placed team with Division III. Division III is now composed of one group of six, and if more than six nations register for this, the lowest level, then a qualification tournament will be held.

===Division IV from 2020===
The IIHF introduced Division IV, intended to debut in the 2020 tournament, but cancelled due to COVID-19. Kyrgyzstan hosted the inaugural Division IV Championship in 2022.

==Rules==
===Game rules===
At the first tournament in 1920, there were many differences from the modern game: games were played outdoors on natural ice, forward passes were not allowed, the rink was 56x18 metres (the current International standard is 61x30 metres) and two twenty-minute periods were played. Each side had seven players on the ice, the extra position being the rover. Following the tournament, the IIHF held a congress and decided to adopt the &quot;Canadian rules&quot;–six men per side and three periods of play.

At an IIHF congress in 1969, officials voted to allow body-checking in all three zones in a rink similar to the NHL. Prior to that, body-checking was only allowed in the defending zone in international hockey. The IIHF later described the rule change as &quot;arguably the most substantial and dramatic rule changes in the history of international hockey&quot; because it allowed for a more aggressive game. The rule, which was first applied at the 1970 World Championships, was controversial: IIHF president Bunny Ahearne feared it would make ice hockey &quot;a sport for goons.&quot; Several other rule changes were implemented in the early 1970s: players were required to wear helmets starting in 1970 and goaltender masks became mandatory in 1972. In 1992, the IIHF switched to using a playoff system to determine medalists and decided that tie games in the medal round would be decided in a shootout. The IIHF decided to test a new rule in 1997 that would allow two-line passes. Prior to that, the neutral zone trap had slowed the game down and reduced scoring. At the 1997 World Championships, teams were allowed to decide if they wanted to test the rule. Although no team accepted the offer, the rule was adopted. The IIHF described it as &quot;the most revolutionary rule change since allowing body-checking in all three zones in 1969. [...] The new rule almost immediately changed the game for the better. The 1999 IIHF World Championship in Norway was a stark contrast to the finals the year before with many more goals scored and with end-to-end action – not defence – dominating play.&quot;

The current IIHF rules differ slightly from the rules used in the NHL. One difference between NHL and IIHF rules is rink dimensions: the NHL rink is narrower, measuring 61x26 metres (200x85 feet), instead of the international size of 61x30.5metres (200x100feet). Another rule difference between the NHL and the IIHF rules concerns how icings are called. As of the 2013–14 regular NHL season, a linesman stops play due to icing using the hybrid icing method, instead of the former method, where a defending player (other than the goaltender) touched the puck before an attacking player was able to, in contrast to the IIHF rules that use &quot;no-touch&quot; icing, where play is stopped the moment the puck crosses the goal line. The NHL and IIHF differ also in penalty rules. The NHL, in addition to the minor and double minor penalties called in IIHF games, calls major penalties which are more dangerous infractions of the rules, such as fighting, and have a duration of five minutes. This is in contrast to the IIHF rule, in which players who fight are ejected from the game.

Since the 2005–06 season, the NHL instituted several new rules. Some of them were already used by the IIHF, such as the shootout and making the two-line pass legal. Others which were not picked up by the IIHF, such as requiring smaller goaltender equipment and the addition of the goaltender trapezoid to the rink. However, the IIHF did agree to follow the NHL&#x27;s league&#x27;s zero-tolerance policy on obstruction and required referees to call more hooking, holding and interference penalties. In 2006, the IIHF voted to eliminate tie games and institute a three-point system: wins in regulation time would be worth three points, overtime wins would be two points and over-time losses would be worth one point. The system was first used at the 2007 World Championships.

Since 2019, the World Championships banned the shootout for the Gold Medal Game. Multiple 20-minute golden goal overtime periods of 3-on-3 are played until whoever scores, which wins the game.

===Player eligibility===
The World Championships have been open to all players, both professional and amateur, since 1977. The IIHF lists the following requirements for a player to be eligible to play:

*&quot;Each player must be under the jurisdiction of an IIHF member national association.&quot;
*&quot;Each player must be a citizen of the country he represents.&quot;
* Each player must be at least 18 years of age on the day the respective championship starts, or be at least 16 and obtain an under age waiver

If a player who has never played in an IIHF competition changes their citizenship, they must participate in national competitions in their new country for at least two consecutive years and have an international transfer card (ITC). If a player who has previously played in an IIHF tournament wishes to change their national team, they must have played in their new country for four years. A player can only do this once.

As this tournament takes place during the same time period as the NHL&#x27;s Stanley Cup playoffs, NHL players generally only become available if their respective NHL team missed the playoffs, or once they have been eliminated from Stanley Cup contention. It is therefore common for several NHL players to join the World Championships while the tournament is already in progress.

==Divisions==

As of 2020, the IIHF World Championships are split into five different divisions. This is the alignment of the divisions, accurate as of the 2018 IIHF World Ranking. Teams that are not ranked are not included here, for a full list of IIHF members, see List of members of the International Ice Hockey Federation.

Keys:
; Promoted
; Never been promoted/relegated (began in that division/group)
; Relegated
E.G. ; 1953 – this means that the team was relegated to that division for the 1953 competition, and have been there ever since.

===Championship===

The Championship division comprises the top sixteen hockey nations in the world. The 87th championship was held from 10 to 26 May 2024, in Prague, and Ostrava, Czech Republic.

Teams for the 2024 IIHF World Championship are:
A. The IIHF recognizes Bohemia, which joined in 1908, and Czechoslovakia as the predecessors to the Czech Republic, which officially became a member in 1993.
B. The IIHF recognizes the Soviet Union, which joined in 1952, as the predecessor to Russia, which officially became a member in 1992.
C. On 28 February 2022, IIHF decided to expel Russia and Belarus from the tournament due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

===Division I===

Division I comprises twelve teams. Group A teams compete for promotion to the Elite Division with the loser being relegated to Division I Group B. Group B teams compete for promotion to Division I Group A while the loser is relegated to Division II Group A. In 2024, Group A games will be played in Bolzano, Italy from 28 April to 4 May, and Group B games will be played in Vilnius, Lithuania from 27 April to 3 May.

Table updated 17 December 2023

===Division II===

Division II comprises twelve teams. Group A teams compete for promotion to Division I Group B with the loser being relegated to Division II Group B. Group B teams compete for promotion to Division II Group A while the loser is relegated to Division III. In 2024, Group A games will be played in Belgrade, Serbia from 21 to 27 April and Group B games will be played in Sofia, Bulgaria from 15 to 21 April.

Table updated 10 December 2023
D. The IIHF recognizes Yugoslavia, which joined in 1939, and Serbia and Montenegro as the predecessors to Serbia, which officially became a member in 2007.

===Division III===

Division III comprises twelve teams. Group A teams compete for promotion to Division II Group B with the loser being relegated to Division III Group B. Group B teams compete for promotion to Division III Group A while the loser is relegated to Division IV. In 2024, Group A games will be played in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan from 10 to 16 March and Group B games were played in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina from 23 to 29 February.

==Directorate awards==

Since 1954, the IIHF has given awards for play during the World Championship tournament. Voted on by the tournament directorate, the first awards recognised the top goaltender, forward and defenceman. In 1999, an award for the most valuable player was added. There is also an all-star team voted on by members of the media. In 2004, Canadian Dany Heatley became the first player to lead in scoring, win the MVP award, win the best forward award and be named to the all-star team in the same year. He repeated the feat in 2008.

<doc id="224643" wikidata="Q1972914" url="?curid=224643" title="Culture of Romania">
<text>The culture of Romania is an umbrella term used to encapsulate the ideas, customs and social behaviours of the people of Romania that developed due to the country&#x27;s distinct geopolitical history and evolution. It is theorized that Romanians and related peoples (Aromanians, Megleno-Romanians, and Istro-Romanians) were formed through the admixture of the descendants of Roman colonists and the indigenous Paleo-Balkanic people who were subsequently Romanized.

== Background ==

Romania&#x27;s history has been full of rebounds: the culturally productive epochs were those of stability when the people proved quite an impressive resourcefulness in the making up for less propitious periods and were able to rejoin the mainstream of European culture. This stands true for the years after the Phanariote-Ottoman period, at the beginning of the 19th century, when Romanians had a historical context and Romania started to become westernized, mainly with French influences, which they pursued steadily and at a very fast pace. From the end of the 18th century, the sons of the upper classes started having their education in Paris, and French became (and was until the communist years) a genuine second language of culture for Romanians.

The modeling role of France, especially in the fields of political ideas, administration, and law, as well as in literature, was paralleled, from the mid-19th century down to World War I, by German culture as well, which also triggered constant relationships with the German world not only at a cultural level but in daily life as well. With the arrival of Soviet communism in the area, Romania quickly adopted many soviet influences, and Russian was also widely taught in the country during Romania&#x27;s socialist years.

==History==

===Middle Ages===
Until the 14th century, small states (Romanian: &quot;voievodate&quot;) were spread across the territory of Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia. The medieval principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia arose in the mid 1300s, in the areas south and east of the Carpathian Mountains respectively.

Moldavia and Wallachia were both situated on important commercial routes often crossed by Polish, Saxon, Greek, Armenian, Genovese, and Venetian merchants, connecting them well to the evolving culture of medieval Europe. Grigore Ureche&#x27;s chronicle, &quot;Letopisețul Țărîi Moldovei&quot; (&quot;The Chronicles of the land of Moldavia&quot;), covering the period from 1359 to 1594, is a very important source of information about life, events, and personalities in Moldavia. It is among the first non-religious Romanian literary texts; due to its size and the information that it contains, it is arguably the most important Romanian document from the 17th century.

The first printed book, a prayer book in Slavonic, was produced in Wallachia in 1508, and the first book in Romanian, a catechism, was printed in Transylvania, in 1544. At the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th century, European humanism influenced the works of Miron Costin and Ion Neculce, the Moldavian chroniclers who continued Ureche&#x27;s work. Constantin Brâncoveanu, prince of Wallachia, was a great patron of the arts and was a local Renaissance figure. During Șerban Cantacuzino&#x27;s reign, the monks at the monastery of Snagov, near Bucharest, published in 1688 the first translated and printed Romanian Bible (&quot;Biblia de la București&quot; – The Bucharest Bible). The first successful attempts at written Romanian-language poetry were made in 1673 when Dosoftei, a Moldavian metropolitan in Iași, published a Romanian metrical psalter.

Dimitrie Cantemir, a Moldavian prince, was an important personality of the medieval period in Moldavia. His interests included philosophy, history, music, linguistics, ethnography, and geography. His most important works containing information about the Romanian regions were &quot;Descriptio Moldaviae&quot;, published in 1769, and &quot;Hronicul vechimii a romano-moldo-valahilor&quot; (roughly, &quot;Chronicle of the Antiquity of the Romano-Moldavo-Wallachians&quot;), the first critical history of Romania. His works were also known in western Europe, as he authored writings in Latin: &quot;Descriptio Moldaviae&quot; (commissioned by the Academy of Berlin, the member of which he became in 1714) and &quot;Incrementa atque decrementa aulae othomanicae&quot;, which was printed in English between 1734–1735 (second edition in 1756), in French in 1743 and in German in 1745 ; the latter was a major reference work in European science and culture up until the 19th century.

===Classical Age===

In Transylvania, although they formed the majority of the population, Romanians were merely seen as a &quot;tolerated nation&quot; by the Austrian leadership of the province, and were not proportionally represented in political life and the Transylvanian Diet. At the end of the 18th century an emancipation movement known as the &quot;Transylvanian School&quot; (&quot;Școala Ardeleană&quot;) was formed, emphasizing the Roman element of the Romanian people, and making significant strides in the formation of a modern Latin-based Romanian alphabet (which eventually supplanted an earlier Cyrillic script). It formed following the Act of Union of 1698, which declared the full communion with the See of Rome of the Romanian Transylvanian church under Metropolitan Atanasie Anghel. Thus, the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church was formed, formalized by a synod of bishops on September 4, 1700. The links with Rome brought to the Romanian Transylvanians the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment. In 1791 the Transylvanian School issued a petition to Emperor Leopold II of Austria, named &quot;Supplex Libellus Valachorum&quot; based on the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, demanding equal political rights with the other ethnicities for the Romanians in Transylvania. This movement, however, leaned more towards westernization in general, when in fact, the origin of the Romanian people is complex, intertwining elements from the peoples of the former Roman Empire with those of the ancient Dacians, and with the addition of 17th and 19th Eastern influences as emphasized through the Ottomans.

The period from 1711 to 1821 was marked in Wallachia and Moldavia by the reigns of appointed Phanariote Hospodars; thus, the two principalities were heavily influenced by the Ottoman and Greek world. Greek schools appeared in the principalities, and in 1818, the first Romanian School was founded in Bucharest by Gheorghe Lazăr and Ion Heliade Rădulescu. Figures such as Anton Pann, a successful novelist, emerged in that time, with Ienăchiță Văcărescu writing the first Romanian grammar, and his nephew Iancu Văcărescu becoming what is considered to be the first important Romanian poet. In 1821, an uprising in Wallachia took place against Phanariote rule. This uprising was led by the Romanian revolutionary and militia leader Tudor Vladimirescu, and would eventually lead to the restoration of Romanian princes on the thrones of the Danubian Principalities.

The revolutionary year 1848 had its echoes also in Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania, and a new elite had emerged from the revolutions represented by figures such as: Mihail Kogălniceanu (writer, politician, and the first prime minister of Romania), Vasile Alecsandri (politician, playwright, and poet), Andrei Mureșanu (publicist and the writer of the current Romanian National Anthem) and Nicolae Bălcescu (historian, writer and revolutionary).

The union between Moldavia and Wallachia in 1859 brought a growing consolidation of Romanian life and culture. Universities were opened in Iași and in Bucharest, and the number of new cultural establishments grew significantly. The new prince from 1866 and then King of Romania, Carol I, was a devoted king, and he and his wife Elisabeth were among the main patrons of arts. Of great impact in Romanian literature was the literary society Junimea, founded in 1863 by the circle of literary critic Titu Maiorescu. It published its cultural journal &quot;Convorbiri Literare&quot; where, among others, Mihai Eminescu, Romania&#x27;s greatest poet, Ion Creangă, a storyteller of genius, and Ion Luca Caragiale, novelist and Romania&#x27;s greatest playwright, published most of their groundbreaking works. During the same period, Nicolae Grigorescu and Ștefan Luchian founded modern Romanian painting; celebrated composer Ciprian Porumbescu was also from this time.

In Transylvania, the emancipation movement became better organized, and in 1861, an important cultural organization by the name of ASTRA (&quot;The Transylvanian Association for Romanian Literature and the Culture of the Romanian People&quot;) was founded in Sibiu under the close supervision of the Romanian Orthodox Metropolitan Andrei Șaguna. It helped publish a great number of Romanian language books and newspapers, and between 1898 and 1904, it published a Romanian Encyclopedia. Among the greatest personalities from this period are the novelist and publicist Ioan Slavici, the prose writer Panait Istrati, the poet and writer Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea, the poet and publicist George Coșbuc, the poet Ștefan Octavian Iosif, the historian and founder of Romanian press in Transylvania George Barițiu and Badea Cârțan, a simple peasant shepherd from Southern Transylvania who, through his actions became a symbol of the emancipation movement.

===Golden Age===

The first half of the 20th century is regarded by many as the golden age of Romanian culture, and it is the period when it reached its main level of international affirmation and a strong connection to European cultural trends. The most important artist who had a great influence on the world culture was the sculptor Constantin Brâncuși (1876–1957), a central figure of the modern movement and a pioneer of abstraction, an innovator of world sculpture by immersion in the primordial sources of folk creation.

The relationship between traditional and Western European trends was a subject of heated polemics, and outstanding personalities sustained the debates. The playwright, expressionist poet, and philosopher Lucian Blaga can be cited as a member of the traditionalist group and the literary critic founder of the literary circle and cultural journal &quot;Sburătorul&quot;, Eugen Lovinescu, represents the so-called Westernizing group, which sought to bring Romanian culture closer to Western European culture. Also, George Călinescu was a more complex writer who, among different literary creations, produced the monumental &quot;History of the Romanian literature, from its origins till present day&quot;.

The beginning of the 20th century was also a prolific period for Romanian prose, with personalities such as the novelist Liviu Rebreanu, who described the struggles in the traditional society and the horrors of war, Mihail Sadoveanu, a writer of novels of epic proportions with inspiration from the medieval history of Moldavia, and Camil Petrescu, a more modern writer distinguishing himself through his analytical prose writing. In dramaturgy, Mihail Sebastian was an influential writer, and as the number of theaters grew, also did the number of actors, Lucia Sturdza Bulandra being an actress representative of this period.

Alongside the prominent poet George Topîrceanu, a poet of equal importance was Tudor Arghezi, who was the first to revolutionize poetry in the last 50 years. One should not neglect the poems of George Bacovia, a symbolist poet of neurosis, and despair and those of Ion Barbu, a brilliant mathematician who wrote a series of very successful cryptic poems. Tristan Tzara and Marcel Janco, founders of the Dadaist movement, were also of Romanian origin.

Also during the golden age came the epoch of Romanian philosophy with such figures as Mircea Vulcănescu, Dimitrie Gusti, Alexandru Dragomir, and Vasile Conta. The period was dominated by the overwhelming personality of the historian and politician Nicolae Iorga, who, during his lifetime, published over 1,250 books and wrote more than 25,000 articles. In music, the composers George Enescu and Constantin Dimitrescu and the pianist Dinu Lipatti became world-famous. The number of important Romanian painters also grew, and the most significant ones were: Nicolae Tonitza, Camil Ressu, Francisc Șirato, Ignat Bednarik, Lucian Grigorescu, and Theodor Pallady. In medicine, a great contribution to human society was the discovery of insulin by the Romanian scientist Nicolae Paulescu. Gheorghe Marinescu was an important neurologist and Victor Babeș was one of the earliest bacteriologists. In mathematics, Gheorghe Țițeica was one of Romania&#x27;s greatest mathematicians, and also an important personality was the mathematician/poet Dan Barbilian.

===Post-war period===
In Romania, the communist regime imposed heavy censorship on almost all elements of life, and they used the cultural world as a means to better control the population. The freedom of expression was constantly restricted in various ways: the Sovietization period was an attempt at building up a new cultural identity on the basis of socialist realism and lending legitimacy to the new order by rejecting traditional values. Two currents appeared: one that glorified the regime and another that tried to avoid censorship. The first is probably of no lasting cultural value, but the second managed to create valuable works, successfully avoiding censorship and being very well received by the general public. From this period, the most outstanding personalities are those of the writer Marin Preda, the poets Nichita Stănescu and Marin Sorescu, and the literary critics Nicolae Manolescu and Eugen Simion. Most dissidents who chose not to emigrate lived a life closely watched by the regime, either in &quot;house arrest&quot; or in &quot;forced domicile&quot;; some chose to retreat to remote monasteries. Most of their work was published after the 1989 Revolution. Among the most notable examples are the philosophers Constantin Noica, Petre Țuțea, and Nicolae Steinhardt.

There was a chasm between the official, communist culture and genuine culture. On the one hand, against the authorities&#x27; intentions, the outstanding works were perceived as a realm of moral truths, and the significant representatives of genuine cultural achievement were held in very high esteem by the public opinion. On the other hand, the slogans disseminated nationwide through the forms of official culture helped spread simplistic views, which were relatively successful among some ranks of the population. The tension between these two directions can still be perceived at the level of society as a whole.

====Culture inside communist Romania====
A strong editorial activity took place during the Communist regime. With the purpose of educating the large masses of peoples, a huge number of books were published. Large-scale editing houses such as &quot;Cartea Românească&quot;, &quot;Editura Eminescu,&quot; and others appeared, which published huge collections of books, such as the &quot;Biblioteca pentru Toţi&quot; (&quot;The Library for Everyone&quot;) with over 5,000 titles. Generally, a book was never published in an edition of less than 50,000 copies. Libraries appeared in every village, and almost all were kept up to date with the newest books published. Also, due to low prices, almost everyone could afford to have their own collection of books at home. The negative part was that all the books were heavily censored. Also, due to rationing in every aspect of life, the quality of the printing and the paper also was very low, and the books, therefore, degraded easily.

During this period, there was a significant increase in the number of theatres, as they appeared even in the smallest towns. Many new establishments were built, and in the big cities they became important landmarks, such as the building of the National Theatre of Bucharest, situated right in the middle of the city, immediately adjacent to Romania&#x27;s kilometre zero. In the smaller towns, there existed the so-called &quot;Worker&#x27;s Theatre&quot;, a semi-professional institution. Partly due to the lack of other entertainment venues, the theatre was highly popular, and the number of actors increased. All of the theatres had a stable, state-funded budget. Again, however, the drawback was the heavy control imposed on them by the regime: censorship was ever-present, and only ideologically-accepted plays were allowed. More progressive theatres managed to survive in some remote cities that became favorite destinations for young actors, but they generally had only a local audience.

Cinemas evolved the same way as the theatres; sometimes, the same establishment served both purposes. Movies were very popular, and from the 1960s, foreign films started becoming quite widespread. Western films, when shown, were heavily censored: entire sections were cut, and dialogue was translated only using ideologically accepted words. Domestic or &quot;friendly&quot; foreign productions constituted the bulk of films in cinemas. During this period, cinematography started to develop in Romania, and the first successful short films were made based on Caragiale&#x27;s plays. Financed by the government, during the 1960s, a whole industry developed at Buftea, a town close to Bucharest, and some films, especially gangster, Western-genre, and historical movies, were very well received by the public. The most prolific director was Sergiu Nicolaescu, and probably the most-acclaimed actor from that period was Amza Pellea.

====Romanians in exile====
A consequence of the communist attitude towards the bourgeoisie elites in general, was the creation, for the first time in Romania&#x27;s history, of a diaspora. Three individuals emerged as the most important Romanians abroad: playwright Eugen Ionescu (1909–1994) (who became known in France as Eugène Ionesco), creator of the Theatre of the Absurd and eventual member of the Académie française; religious historian and writer Mircea Eliade (1907–1986); and the essayist and philosopher Emil Cioran (1911–1996), the greatest French-writing master of style after Pascal. Fellow Romanian Ioan Petre Culianu continued Eliade&#x27;s work with great success, in the United States. Another member of the diaspora who distinguished himself was the philosopher and logician Stephane Lupasco.
The communist rule in Romania, unlike most of the other countries of the Eastern bloc, permanently repudiated the Romanians who had left their country and labeled them as traitors to the Fatherland. So, neither Mircea Eliade, nor Eugène Ionesco, nor Emil Cioran, whose works would be published in this country sporadically after 1960, could see their native land again. It was only after 1989 that the process of regaining the values of the diaspora and of reintegrating its personalities into this country&#x27;s culture could be started seriously, a process marked in its turn by tension and disagreements.

Well-known Romanian musicians outside of Romania during this period include conductors Sergiu Celibidache—the main conductor at the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and later of Munich Philharmonic Orchestra—and Constantin Silvestri, main conductor at the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. Gheorghe Zamfir was a virtuoso of the pan pipes and made this instrument known to a modern worldwide audience, and was also a composer or interpreter for a great number of movies. Composer and architect Iannis Xenakis was born in Romania and spent his childhood there.

George Emil Palade, a cell biologist and a teacher, became the first Romanian to receive the Nobel Prize, winning the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for &quot;describing the structure and function of organelles in cells&quot;. Elie Wiesel, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986, was born in the Romanian town of Sighetu Marmaţiei.

===Evolutions after 1989===

The fall of soviet-style communism in 1989 elated the cultural world, but the experience hasn&#x27;t been an easy one due to problems in the transition period and the adoption of a free market economy. The discontinuation of state and political control of culture brought about the long dreamt freedom of expression, but, at the same time, the state subsidies also stopped, and Romania&#x27;s culture was seriously affected by the side-effects of the incipient, still very imperfect, free-market economy and by inadequate material resources. Culture has had to cope with a variety of problems, one of them being a shift in people&#x27;s interest towards other areas such as the press and television. The search for a new cultural policy, relying on decentralization, seems to prevail now. People speak about a crisis of culture in this country, but if there is a crisis of culture, it is only at an institutional level.

After the fall of communism in 1989, there was an almost immediate explosion of publication of books previously censored by the regime. Books were published in huge numbers per edition, sales were high, and a great number of publishing houses appeared. However, this soon reached a saturation point, and publishing houses began to decline due to a combination of bad management, a rapid drop in sales, and the absence of subsidies. Many closed after publishing only a few titles; some changed their profile and started printing commercial literature – mainly translations – and the state-owned publishers entered a &quot;state of lethargy&quot;. The latter survived due to state financing, but their publishing activity diminished. Despite this, some publishing houses managed to survive and develop by implementing market-oriented policies, and by improving the quality and overall appearance of the books they published. Among the most notable contemporary Romanian publishers are Humanitas in Bucharest, Polirom in Iași, and Teora, which specializes in technical topics and dictionaries. Some publishing houses developed their own chains or bookstores, and also other new, privately owned bookstore chains opened, replacing the old state-owned ones.

Culturally oriented newsprint periodicals followed a similar trajectory of boom and bust. A few have survived and managed to raise their quality and to maintain a critical spirit despite the hardships they encountered. &quot;Dilema Veche&quot; (&quot;Old Dilemma&quot;) and &quot;Revista 22&quot; (&quot;Magazine 22&quot;) remain respected forces in Romanian culture, with &quot;Observator Cultural&quot; a lesser, but also respected, weekly paper. Also, a state-financed radio (&quot;Radio România Cultural&quot;) and a television channel (&quot;TVR Cultural&quot;) with a cultural programme exist, but they are not highly popular.

Many new young writers appeared, but due to financial constraints, only those who have gained a strong reputation could get the financial backing to publish their works. The Writers&#x27;s Union, which should, in principle, support these writers&#x27; efforts, hasn&#x27;t undergone much change since 1989, and there is much controversy surrounding its activity and purpose. The most successful writers, like Mircea Cărtărescu, Gabriela Adamesteanu, Mircea Dinescu, Ana Blandiana, Doina Ruști, Radu Aldulescu, Claudiu Komartin etc

Horia-Roman Patapievici, Andrei Pleşu, Gabriel Liiceanu, and Herta Müller, are respected personalities in Romanian life, but they have to devote some of their would-be writing time to other activities, mainly journalism. The ties with the Romanian diaspora are now very strong, and even foreign-language Romanian writers like Andrei Codrescu (who now writes primarily in English) are very popular.

Romanian theatre also suffered from economic hardships, and its popularity decreased drastically due to the increased popularity of television and other entertainment channels. Some theatres survived due to their prestige (and some continued subsidies); others survived through good management, investing in themselves, and earning a steady audience through the high quality of their productions. Experimental or independent theatres appeared and are quite popular in university cities. Uniter – &quot;The Romanian Theatres Association&quot; – gives yearly awards to the best performances. Some of the most critically acclaimed directors in contemporary Romania are Andrei Șerban, Silviu Purcărete, Mihai Măniuțiu, Gábor Tompa, Alexandru Dabija, Victor Ioan Frunză, Radu Afrim and Alexandru Darie. Also, among the most appreciated actors, both from the new and old generation, one can name Ștefan Iordache, Victor Rebengiuc, Maia Morgenstern, Marcel Iureș, Horațiu Mălăele, Ion Caramitru, Mircea Diaconu, Marius Chivu and others.

Due to the lack of funds, Romanian film-making suffered heavily in the 1990s; even now, as of 2005, a lot of controversy surrounds state aid for movies. Well-known directors such as Dan Piţa and Lucian Pintilie have had a certain degree of continued success, and younger directors such as Cristian Mungiu, Nae Caranfil, Cristi Puiu, Corneliu Porumboiu, Radu Jude and Radu Muntean have become highly respected. Caranfil&#x27;s film &quot;Filantropica&quot; and Puiu&#x27;s &quot;The Death of Mr. Lazarescu&quot; were extremely well received and gained awards at international festivals in Paris and Cannes. Besides domestic production, Romania became a favorite destination for international producers due to the low cost of filming there, and big investments have been made in large studios.

The number of cultural events held yearly in Romania has increased over the past few years. Some sporadic events like the &quot;2005 Bucharest CowParade&quot; have been well received, and yearly events and festivals have continually attracted interest. Medieval festivals held in cities in Transylvania, which combine street theatre with music and battle reenactments to create a very lively atmosphere, are some of the most popular events. In theatre, a yearly National Festival takes place, and one of the most important international theatre festivals is &quot;&quot;The Sibiu Theatre Festival&quot;,&quot; while in filmmaking, the &quot;&quot;TIFF&quot; Film Festival&quot; in Cluj, the &quot;&quot;Dakino&quot; Film Festival&quot; in Bucharest and the &quot;&quot;Anonimul&quot; Film Festival&quot; in the Danube Delta have an ever-stronger international presence. In music, the most important event is the &quot;&quot;George Enescu&quot; Classical Music Festival,&quot; but festivals like &quot;&quot;Jeunesses Musicales&quot; International Festival&quot; and Jazz festivals in Sibiu, Cluj and Bucharest are also appreciated. An important event took place in 2007 when the city of Sibiu was, along with Luxembourg, the European Capital of Culture.

Folklore in Romania

Southern traditional Romanian costumes from Bucharest, late 19th century
The most striking thing about Romanian culture is the strong folk traditions which have survived to this day due to the rural character of the Romanian communities, which has resulted in an exceptionally vital and creative traditional culture. Romania&#x27;s rich folk traditions have been nourished by many sources, some of which predate the Roman occupation. Traditional folk arts include wood carving, ceramics, weaving, and embroidery of costumes, household decorations, dance, and richly varied folk music. Ethnographers have tried to collect in the last two centuries as many elements as possible: the Museum of the Romanian Peasant and the Romanian Academy are currently the main institutions which systematically organize the data and continue the research of these elements.

The wood used to be the main construction material, and heavily ornamented wooden objects were common in old houses. In Maramureș, wood was used to create impressive structures such as churches or gates; in Dobruja, windmills were made of wood, and in mountainous regions, hardwood was used even for covering the roof. To preserve traditional houses, many village museums have been created in the last century throughout Romania, such as the Village Museum in Bucharest, the Traditional Popular Civilization ASTRA Museum in Sibiu, or the Oltenian Village Museum in Râmnicu Vâlcea.

Linen was the most common material for clothing, combined with wool during the winter or colder periods.These clothes of linen and wool would then be embroidered with traditional motifs that vary from region to region. The Romanian traditional dress is still worn and created in this fashion around the rural areas of the country. Black is the most common color used, but red and blue are predominant in certain areas. Traditionally, men wore a white shirt and pants with a wide leather belt, usually over the shirt, and a vest sometimes made of leather and embroidered. They wore either boots or simple sandals made of leather called &quot;opinci,&quot; and they often wore a hat differing in design from region to region. Women also wore a white skirt and a shirt with a vest. They also traditionally wore an apron which had also been embroidered, and a variety of different headscarfs; on special occasions, they wore more elaborate outfits. 

Music and dance represent a lively part of the Romanian folklore, and there are a great variety of musical genres and dances. Party music is very lively and shows both Balkan and Hungarian influences. Sentimental music, however, is the most valued, and Romanians consider their &quot;doina&quot; (a sad song either about one&#x27;s home or about love, composed like an epic ballad) unique in the world. Maria Tănase, Maria Lătărețu, Maria Ciobanu, and Ileana Sararoiu are considered to be some of the greatest Romanian folk singers, and today Grigore Leșe and Taraful Haiducilor are two of the most significant representatives of such styles. The dances are lively and are practiced throughout Romania by a large number of professional and amateur groups, thus keeping the tradition alive; Hora is one of the most popular peasant group dances, but more complex dances such as the ritual dance Căluș, danced originally by the Călușari, have been declared by UNESCO to be &quot;Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritages of Humanity&quot;.

===Mythology===

Romanians have had, from time immemorial, a myriad of customs, tales, and poems about love, faith, kings, princesses, and witches. The ethnologists, poets, writers, and historians have tried in recent centuries to collect and to preserve tales, poems, ballads and have tried to describe as well as possible the customs and habits related to different events and times of the year. Customs related to certain times of year are the &quot;colinde&quot;, Romanian Christmas carols, &quot;sorcova&quot; on New Year&#x27;s Eve, or the &quot;Mărțișor&quot; custom on the first day of March, marking the spring. Other customs are presumably of pre-Christian pagan origin, like the &quot;Paparuda&quot; rain enchanting custom in the summer, or the masked folk theatre or &quot;Ursul&quot; (the bear) and &quot;Capra&quot; (the goat) in winter.

Perhaps the most successful collector of folk tales was the novelist and storyteller Ion Creangă, who in very picturesque language, shaped into their now-classic form stories like &quot;Harap Alb&quot; (&quot;The White Moor&quot;) or &quot;Fata babei și fata moșului&quot; (roughly, &quot;The old woman&#x27;s daughter and the old man&#x27;s daughter&quot;).

Also, the poet Vasile Alecsandri published the most successful version of the ballad &quot;Miorița&quot; (&quot;The Little Ewe&quot;), a sad, philosophical poem, centered on a simple action: the plot by two shepherds to kill a third shepherd because they envied his wealth. Another prolific editor of folk tales was Petre Ispirescu, who, in the 19th century, published an impressive number of volumes containing a large number of short novels and tales from popular mythology. They are centered on popular characters like the prince &quot;Făt-Frumos&quot; (the Romanian &quot;Prince Charming&quot;), the princess Ileana Cosânzeana, the villain or monster &quot;Zmeu&quot; or &quot;Căpcăun&quot;, the dragon &quot;Balaur,&quot; or fantastic superbeings like the good &quot;Zână&quot; and the evil &quot;Muma Pădurii&quot;.

===Spirituality and religion===

Romanian spirituality is greatly influenced by its strong connections with the Eastern Christian world. The modern national mythology contends Romanians are &quot;An island of Latinity in a Slavic sea&quot; and &quot;The only Orthodox Christian Latin people&quot;. There are only a few Romanian Catholics (of both the Roman and Greek rites) and a small number of Protestants, the vast majority of Romanians being Romanian Orthodox (over 81%). Despite the diminishing importance of the church in recent generations, it remains the most trusted institution in Romania. Church attendance is high in rural communities and among the elders in the cities. Also, despite accusations of collaborationism with the communist regime, which continue to plague the Romanian Church, some clerics such as Dumitru Stăniloae and Richard Wurmbrand openly protested against political interventions in religious business. There are also some Muslims living in the country.

Romanian Orthodox monasteries and churches exist throughout Romania, but traditionally, few are constructed on a monumental scale. A great number of wooden churches are still intact in the Carpathian Mountains villages, but by far, the most impressive is the Wooden Churches of Maramureș, which push wood building technique to its limits. Byzantine influences can be found in most Romanian church buildings, but domestic styles have evolved in different periods of time and in different regions. In Moldavia, a particular style was used in the construction of the monasteries, of which some of the most important are the churches of northern Moldavia – UNESCO World Heritage Sites, such as those of Moldovița, Putna, Sucevița, or Voroneț. In Wallachia, Curtea de Argeș Cathedral was built in a Byzantine style with Moorish influences, and a great number of churches show Greek influences, especially those built in the 18th century, such as Stavropoleos Church in central Bucharest. Romania also evolved the distinctive Brâncovenesc style: the monasteries of Snagov and of Sâmbăta de Sus in Transylvania are classic examples.
===Cuisine===


The cuisine of Romania has the same influences as the rest of Romanian culture; from Roman times, there still exists the simple pie called, in Romanian, &quot;plăcintă&quot; and keeping the initial meaning of the Latin word &quot;placenta&quot;. The Turks brought meatballs (fried &quot;mititei&quot; or &quot;perişoare&quot; in a soup called &quot;ciorbă&quot;); from the Greeks, there is the &quot;musaca&quot; (moussaka) and &quot;covrigi&quot; (hot pretzels); from the Bulgarians, a wide variety of vegetable dishes like &quot;zacuscă&quot;; from the Austrians there is the &quot;şniţel&quot; (schnitzel); from the Hungarians, their ornate pastries; and the list could go on.

Without a doubt, one of the most popular dishes in Romania, and perhaps can be called the national dish, is &quot;Sarmale&quot;, or &quot;Sarma&quot; in other cultures of the Balkans, and the Caucasus; a mixture of pork, beef, and lamb, or just plain pork, with onions and rice, wrapped in semi-sour cabbage or grape leaves, and then placed usually in a porcelain pot with tomato paste and pork cuts. This dish is then slow-cooked, and commonly served with cornmeal (mămăligă, which is a type of polenta). One of the most common meals is the &quot;mămăligă&quot;, a cornmeal mush, for a long time considered the &quot;poor man&#x27;s meal&quot; (&quot;N-are nici o mămăligă pe masă&quot; – &quot;He hasn&#x27;t even a mămăligă on the table&quot;), but it has become very appreciated in recent times. Pork is the main meat used in Romanian cuisine, but also beef is consumed and a good lamb or fish dish is never to be refused. In conjunction with special events or periods, different recipes are prepared.

During Christmas, nearly every family slaughters a pig and cooks it using a wide variety of traditional recipes like &quot;cârnați&quot; – a type of long sausage with meat; &quot;caltaboși&quot; – sausages made with liver and other internal organs; &quot;piftie&quot; – a jelly made from parts like the feet, head and ears; &quot;tochitură&quot; (a kind of stew) – served along with mămăligă and wine (&quot;so that the pork can swim&quot;); and &quot;tobă&quot; (head cheese). The meal is sweetened with the traditional &quot;cozonac&quot; (sweet bread with nuts, poppy seeds or lokum – &quot;rahat&quot; in Romanian, known in English as Turkish delight).

Lamb is traditional for Easter; the main dishes are &quot;borș de miel&quot; (lamb sour soup), roast lamb, and &quot;drob&quot; – a cooked mix of offal, meat and fresh vegetables, which is quite similar to Scottish haggis, served with &quot;pască&quot; (a pie made with cottage cheese) as a sweetener.

Wine is the main drink and has been a tradition for over three millennia. Romania is currently the world&#x27;s ninth-largest wine producer, and exports have increased in recent years. A wide variety of domestic (Grasă, Tămâioasă) and worldwide (Italian Riesling, Merlot, Sauvignon blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Muscat Ottonel) varieties are produced. Romania is the world&#x27;s second-largest grower of plums, and almost all of those plums become either the famous &quot;țuică&quot; (a once-refined plum brandy) or &quot;palincă&quot; (twice-or-more-refined plum brandy). Beer is also highly appreciated, generally blonde pilsener beer, after the German style.

A great number of proverbs and sayings have developed around the activity of eating. From the innocent child&#x27;s thank you: &quot;Săru-mâna pentru masă, c-a fost bună şi gustoasă, și bucătăreasa frumoasa&quot; (&quot;Thank you for the meal, it was good and tasty, and the cook was beautiful&quot;), to the more philosophical &quot;Mulțumescu-ți ție Doamne, c-am mâncat și iar mi-e foame&quot; (&quot;Thank you Lord, for I have eaten, but I am hungry again&quot;), &quot;Dragostea trece prin stomac&quot; (&quot;Love passes through the stomach&quot;), the simple &quot;Pofta vine mâncănd&quot; (&quot;Appetite comes while eating&quot;), the sarcastic &quot;Porcul mănâncă orice, dar se-ngrașă pentru alții&quot; (&quot;The pig would eat anything but it gets fat for others&quot;), or the expression of total fulfillment, &quot;Mâncat bine, băut bine, dimineața sculat mort&quot; (&quot;Ate well, drank well, in the morning woke up dead&quot;).

===Romanian script===

During the 16th century, Romanian first appeared in writing, usually in religious texts and other written documents. A letter dating from 1521, from Neacșu of Câmpulung to the mayor of Brașov, is considered to be the earliest known text written in Romanian. The letter was written in a script which was used mainly in Wallachia and Moldavia until the year 1859. This script was a version of the Old Church Slavonic alphabet, a version of the Cyrillic alphabet.

A version of the Cyrillic alphabet was used in the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic until 1991, when they switched to the Romanian version of the Latin alphabet.

==Contribution of the minorities==

Minorities have made a major cultural contribution to Romania. Influences came from, most notably, minority groups such as Germans, Greeks, Italians, and Hungarians. The Székely and the Saxons living in Transylvania, Hungarians in the Partium and Banat regions, and the Jasz people and Csángos in Western Moldavia, made many important architectural contributions to the region, including numerous churches, fortifications, and town centers. Also, they figured in some landmarks in the development of ethnic Romanian culture: the first letter written in Romanian was addressed to the mayor of Kronstadt (Romanian: Brașov), and the first book printed in Romanian was in Hermannstadt (Romanian: Sibiu). Romania was once also the cradle of Yiddish theatre, and to this day, Bucharest is home to a State Jewish Theater, despite the small number of Jews remaining in the country.

==Architecture and engineering==

In the technical domain, one can note the achievements in the field of aviation made by Traian Vuia, Aurel Vlaicu, Aurel Persu, and Henri Coandă and also the works of George Constantinescu in the fields of engineering and sonics. Also, many achievements have been made in the architectural and engineering domain; thus, Bucharest became known as &quot;the small Paris&quot;. The longest bridge in Europe was constructed by Anghel Saligny, linking Dobruja with the rest of Romania; the Peleș Castle became one of the most beautiful and modern castles in Europe.


==Media and television==

==Music==

Folk music is the oldest form of Romanian musical creation, characterized by great vitality; it is the defining source of the cultured musical creation, both religious and lay. Conservation of Romanian folk music has been aided by a large and enduring audience, and by numerous performers who helped propagate and further develop the folk sound. Two of them, Vasile Pandelescu, and Dumnitru Zamfira are some of the most famous examples of Romanian folk musicians.

Before the major incorporation of more modern instruments that found their way into Romanian folk music, older instruments such as the Tobă (double-headed drum, also known as the Tabul or Davul), Surlă (also known as the Zurna in other parts of the Balkans), Caval (ancient shepherd&#x27;s pipe), Cobza (an ancient instrument related to the Arabic Oud), Vioară (violin), Cimpoi (Balkan bagpipe), and the Tamburină (tambourine, more commonly used during the times under Phanariote and Ottoman influence), were also commonly used in folk music before the introduction on some slightly more modern elements such as the widely used accordion, and clarinet. Folk music, often is accentuated with clapping, yells of tongue rolling, shouts, and whistles.

The religious musical creation, born under the influence of Byzantine music adjusted to the intonations of the local folk music, saw a period of glory between the 15th-17th centuries, when reputed schools of liturgical music developed within Romanian monasteries. Russian and Western influences brought about the introduction of polyphony in religious music in the 18th century, a genre developed by a series of Romanian composers in the 19th and 20th centuries.

<doc id="224645" wikidata="Q380509" url="?curid=224645" title="Thomas Chatterton">
<text>Thomas Chatterton (20 November 1752 – 24 August 1770) was an English poet whose precocious talents ended in suicide at age 17. He was an influence on Romantic artists of the period such as Shelley, Keats, Wordsworth and Coleridge.

Although fatherless and raised in poverty, Chatterton was an exceptionally studious child, publishing mature work by the age of 11. He was able to pass off his work as that of an imaginary 15th-century poet called Thomas Rowley, chiefly because few people at the time were familiar with medieval poetry, though he was denounced by Horace Walpole.

At 17, he sought outlets for his political writings in London, having impressed the Lord Mayor, William Beckford, and the radical leader John Wilkes, but his earnings were not enough to keep him, and he poisoned himself in despair. His unusual life and death attracted much interest among the romantic poets, and Alfred de Vigny wrote a play about him that is still performed today. The oil painting &quot;The Death of Chatterton&quot; by Pre-Raphaelite artist Henry Wallis has enjoyed lasting fame.

==Childhood==

Chatterton was born in Bristol where the office of sexton of St Mary Redcliffe had long been held by the Chatterton family. The poet&#x27;s father, also named Thomas Chatterton, was a musician, a poet, a numismatist, and a dabbler in the occult. He had been a sub-chanter at Bristol Cathedral and master of the Pyle Street free school, near Redcliffe church.

After Chatterton&#x27;s birth (15 weeks after his father&#x27;s death on 7 August 1752), his mother established a girls&#x27; school and took in sewing and ornamental needlework. Chatterton was admitted to Edward Colston&#x27;s Charity, a Bristol charity school, in which the curriculum was limited to reading, writing, arithmetic and the catechism.

Chatterton, however, was always fascinated with his uncle the sexton and the church of St Mary Redcliffe. The knights, ecclesiastics and civic dignitaries on its altar tombs became familiar to him. Then he found a fresh interest in oaken chests in the muniment room over the porch on the north side of the nave, where parchment deeds, old as the Wars of the Roses, lay forgotten. Chatterton learned his first letters from the illuminated capitals of an old musical folio, and he learned to read out of a black-letter Bible. His sister said he did not like reading out of small books. Wayward from his earliest years, and uninterested in the games of other children, he was thought to be educationally backward. His sister related that on being asked what device he would like painted on a bowl that was to be his, he replied, &quot;Paint me an angel, with wings, and a trumpet, to trumpet my name over the world.&quot;

From his earliest years, he was liable to fits of abstraction, sitting for hours in what seemed like a trance, or crying for no reason. His lonely circumstances helped foster his natural reserve, and to create the love of mystery which exercised such an influence on the development of his poetry. When Chatterton was age 6, his mother began to recognise his capacity; at age 8, he was so eager for books that he would read and write all day long if undisturbed; by the age of 11, he had become a contributor to Felix Farley&#x27;s &quot;Bristol Journal&quot;.

His confirmation inspired him to write some religious poems published in that paper. In 1763, a cross which had adorned the churchyard of St Mary Redcliffe for upwards of three centuries was destroyed by a churchwarden. The spirit of veneration was strong in Chatterton, and he sent to the local journal on 7 January 1764 a satire on the parish vandal. He also liked to lock himself in a little attic which he had appropriated as his study; and there, with books, cherished parchments, loot purloined from the muniment room of St Mary Redcliffe, and drawing materials, the child lived in thought with his 15th-century heroes and heroines.

==First &quot;medieval&quot; works==
The first of his literary mysteries was the dialogue of &quot;Elinoure and Juga,&quot; which he showed to Thomas Phillips, the usher at Colston&#x27;s Hospital (where he was a pupil), pretending it was the work of a 15th-century poet. Chatterton remained a boarder at Colston&#x27;s Hospital for more than six years, and it was only his uncle who encouraged the pupils to write. Three of Chatterton&#x27;s companions are named as youths whom Phillips&#x27;s taste for poetry stimulated to rivalry; but Chatterton told no one about his own more daring literary adventures. His little pocket-money was spent on borrowing books from a circulating library; and he ingratiated himself with book collectors, in order to obtain access to John Weever, William Dugdale and Arthur Collins, as well as to Thomas Speght&#x27;s edition of Chaucer, Spenser and other books. At some point he came across Elizabeth Cooper&#x27;s anthology of verse, which is said to have been a major source for his inventions.

Chatterton&#x27;s &quot;Rowleian&quot; jargon appears to have been chiefly the result of the study of John Kersey&#x27;s &quot;Dictionarium Anglo-Britannicum&quot;, and it seems his knowledge even of Chaucer was very slight. His holidays were mostly spent at his mother&#x27;s house, and much of them in the favourite retreat of his attic study there. He lived for the most part in an ideal world of his own, in the reign of Edward IV, during the mid-15th century, when the great Bristol merchant William II Canynges (died 1474), five times mayor of Bristol, patron and rebuilder of St Mary Redcliffe &quot;still ruled in Bristol&#x27;s civic chair.&quot; Canynges was familiar to him from his recumbent effigy in Redcliffe church, and is represented by Chatterton as an enlightened patron of art and literature.

==Adopts persona of Thomas Rowley==
Chatterton soon conceived the romance of Thomas Rowley, an imaginary monk of the 15th century, and adopted for himself the pseudonym Thomas Rowley for poetry and history. Psychoanalyst Louise J. Kaplan suggested that Chatterton being fatherless played a great role in his imposturous creation of Rowley. The development of his masculine identity was held back by the fact that he was raised by two women: his mother Sarah and his sister Mary. Therefore, &quot;to reconstitute the lost father in fantasy,&quot; he unconsciously created &quot;two interweaving family romances [fantasies], each with its own scenario.&quot; The first of these was the romance of Rowley for whom he created a fatherlike, wealthy patron, William Canynge, while the second was as Kaplan named it his romance of &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk.&quot; He imagined he would become a famous poet who by his talents would be able to rescue his mother from poverty.

At the same time, there was a real poet named Thomas Rowley in Vermont, although it is unlikely that Chatterton was aware of the existence of the American poet.

==Chatterton&#x27;s search for a patron==
To bring his hopes to life, Chatterton started to look for a patron. At first, he was trying to do so in Bristol where he became acquainted with William Barrett, George Catcott and Henry Burgum. He assisted them by providing Rowley transcripts for their work. The antiquary William Barrett relied exclusively on these fake transcripts when writing his &quot;History and Antiquities of Bristol&quot; (1789) which became an enormous failure. But since his Bristol patrons were not willing to pay him enough, he turned to the wealthier Horace Walpole. In 1769, Chatterton sent &quot;The Ryse of Peyncteynge yn Englade&quot; to Walpole, along with specimens of pseudo-medieval poetry he attributed to Rowley and others. Walpole professed himself &quot;singularly obliged,&quot; calling the letter &quot;valuable and full of information&quot; and the poems &quot;wonderful for their harmony and spirit,&quot; and offering to print them &quot;if they have never been printed.&quot; Later, however, after Chatterton confessed his age and situation, Walpole consulted his friends Thomas Gray and William Mason about the veracity of the writings, and Gray &quot;at once pronounced them forgeries.&quot; Walpole&#x27;s pride was injured at having been duped by Chatterton, and he scornfully cut off correspondence with the poet. Many later commentators have reproached Walpole for this, especially in light of Walpole&#x27;s having passed off his own Gothic novel &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; as a translation from a medieval Italian manuscript. Walpole&#x27;s comment that Chatterton&#x27;s &quot;ingenuity in counterfeiting styles, and, I believe, hands, might easily have led him to those more facile imitations of prose, promissory notes&quot; led Samuel Taylor Coleridge to remark: &quot;Oh! ye who honor the name of &quot;man&quot;, rejoice that Walpole is called &quot;a lord.&quot;&quot; Some writers have speculated that, had Walpole reacted differently, &quot;a slight effort, at this time, ... might have saved from destruction Thomas Chatterton.&quot;

==Political writings==
Badly hurt by Walpole&#x27;s snub, Chatterton wrote very little for a summer. Then, after the end of the summer, he turned his attention to periodical literature and politics, and exchanged Farley&#x27;s &quot;Bristol Journal&quot; for the &quot;Town and Country Magazine&quot; and other London periodicals. Imitating the style of the pseudonymous letter writer Junius, then in the full blaze of his triumph, he turned his pen against the Duke of Grafton, the Earl of Bute and Augusta of Saxe-Gotha (the then Princess of Wales).

==Leaving Bristol==
He had just dispatched one of his political diatribes to the &quot;Middlesex Journal&quot; when he sat down on Easter Eve, 17 April 1770, and penned his &quot;Last Will and Testament,&quot; a satirical compound of jest and earnest, in which he intimated his intention of ending his life the following evening. Among his satirical bequests, such as his &quot;humility&quot; to the Rev. Mr Camplin, his &quot;religion&quot; to Dean Barton, and his &quot;modesty&quot; along with his &quot;prosody and grammar&quot; to Mr Burgum, he leaves &quot;to Bristol all his spirit and disinterestedness, parcels of goods unknown on its quay since the days of Canynge and Rowley.&quot; In more genuine earnestness, he recalls the name of Michael Clayfield, a friend to whom he owed intelligent sympathy. The will was possibly prepared in order to frighten his master into letting him go. If so, it had the desired effect. John Lambert, the attorney to whom he was apprenticed, cancelled his indentures; his friends and acquaintances having donated money, Chatterton went to London.

==London==

Chatterton already was known to the readers of the &quot;Middlesex Journal&quot; as a rival of Junius under the nom de plume of Decimus. He also had been a contributor to &quot;Hamilton&#x27;s Town and Country Magazine&quot;, and speedily found access to the &quot;Freeholder&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, another political miscellany supportive of John Wilkes and liberty. His contributions were accepted, but the editors paid little or nothing for them.

He wrote hopefully to his mother and sister, and spent his first earnings in buying gifts for them. Wilkes had noted his trenchant style &quot;and expressed a desire to know the author&quot;; and Lord Mayor William Beckford graciously acknowledged a political address of his, and greeted him &quot;as politely as a citizen could.&quot;

Chatterton was abstemious and extraordinarily diligent. He could assume the style of Junius or Tobias Smollett, reproduce the satiric bitterness of Charles Churchill, parody James Macpherson&#x27;s &quot;Ossian&quot;, or write in the manner of Alexander Pope or with the polished grace of Thomas Gray and William Collins.

He wrote political letters, eclogues, lyrics, operas and satires, both in prose and verse. In June 1770, after nine weeks in London, he moved from Shoreditch, where he had lodged with a relative, to an attic in Brook Street, Holborn (now beneath Alfred Waterhouse&#x27;s Holborn Bars building). He was still short of money; and now, state prosecutions of the press rendered letters in the Junius vein no longer admissible. This threw him back on the lighter resources of his pen. In Shoreditch, he had shared a room; but now, for the first time, he enjoyed uninterrupted solitude. His bed-fellow at Mr Walmsley&#x27;s, Shoreditch, noted that much of the night was spent by him in writing; and now he could write all throughout the night. The romance of his earlier years re-emerged, and he transcribed from an imaginary parchment of the old priest Rowley his &quot;Excelente Balade of Charitie.&quot; This poem, disguised in archaic language, he sent to the editor of the &quot;Town and Country Magazine&quot;, where it was rejected.

Mr Cross, a neighbouring apothecary, repeatedly invited him to join him at dinner or supper; but he refused. His landlady, too, pressed him to share her dinner, but in vain. &quot;She knew,&quot; as she afterwards said, &quot;that he had not eaten anything for two or three days.&quot; However, Chatterton assured her that he was not hungry. The note of his actual receipts, found in his pocket-book after his death, shows that Hamilton, Fell and other editors who had been so liberal in flattery, had paid him at the rate of a shilling for an article, and less than eightpence each for his songs; much of the accepted material was held in reserve and still unpaid for. According to his foster-mother, Chatterton had wished to study medicine with Barrett, and in his desperation he wrote to Barrett for a letter to help him to an opening as a surgeon&#x27;s assistant on board an African trading ship.

== Death ==
In August 1770, while walking in St Pancras Churchyard, Chatterton was much absorbed in thought, and did not notice a newly dug open grave in his path, and tumbled into it. On observing this event, his walking companion helped Chatterton out of the grave, and told him in a jocular manner that he was happy in assisting at the resurrection of genius. Chatterton replied, &quot;My dear friend, I have been at war with the grave for some time now.&quot; Chatterton committed suicide three days later. On 24 August 1770, he retired for the last time to his attic in Brook Street, carrying with him arsenic, which he drank after tearing into fragments whatever literary remains were at hand. He was 17 years and nine months old. There has been some speculation that Chatterton may have taken the arsenic as a treatment for a venereal disease, as it was commonly used for such at that time.

A few days later, one Dr Thomas Fry came to London with the intention of giving financial support to the young boy &quot;whether discoverer or author merely.&quot; A fragment, probably one of the last pieces written by the poet, was put together by Dr Fry from the shreds of paper that covered the floor of Chatterton&#x27;s attic on the morning of 25 August 1770. The would-be patron of the poet had an eye for literary forgeries, and purchased the scraps that the poet&#x27;s landlady, Mrs Angel, swept into a box, cherishing the hope of discovering a suicide note among the pieces. This fragment, possibly one of the remnants of Chatterton&#x27;s very last literary efforts, was identified by Dr Fry to be a modified ending of the poet&#x27;s tragical interlude &quot;Aella&quot;. The fragment is now in the possession of Bristol Public Library and Art Gallery.

&lt;poem&gt;
Coernyke.
Awake! Awake! O Birtha, swotie mayde!
Thie Aella deadde, botte thou ynne wayne wouldst dye,
Sythence he thee for renomme hath betrayde,
Bie hys owne sworde forslagen doth he lye;
Yblente he was to see thie boolie eyne,
Yet nowe o Birtha, praie, for Welkynnes, lynge!
How redde thie lippes, how dolce thie deft cryne,
...scalle bee thie Kynge!
...a.
...omme the kiste
&lt;/poem&gt;

The final Alexandrine is completely missing, together with Chatterton&#x27;s notes. However, according to Dr Fry, the character who utters the final lines must have been Birtha, whose last word might have been something like &quot;kisste&quot;.

==Posthumous recognition==
The death of Chatterton attracted little notice at the time; for the few who then entertained any appreciative estimate of the Rowley poems regarded him as their mere transcriber. He was interred in a burying-ground attached to the Shoe Lane Workhouse in the parish of St Andrew, Holborn, later the site of Farringdon Market. There is a discredited story that the body of the poet was recovered, and secretly buried by his uncle, Richard Phillips, in Redcliffe Churchyard. There a monument has been erected to his memory, with the appropriate inscription, borrowed from his &quot;Will&quot;, and so supplied by the poet&#x27;s own pen. &quot;To the memory of Thomas Chatterton. Reader! judge not. If thou art a Christian, believe that he shall be judged by a Superior Power. To that Power only is he now answerable.&quot;

It was after Chatterton&#x27;s death that the controversy over his work began. &quot;Poems supposed to have been written at Bristol by Thomas Rowley and others, in the Fifteenth Century&quot; (1777) was edited by Thomas Tyrwhitt, a Chaucerian scholar who believed them genuine medieval works. However, the appendix to the following year&#x27;s edition recognises that they were probably Chatterton&#x27;s own work. Thomas Warton, in his &quot;History of English Poetry&quot; (1778) included Rowley among 15th-century poets, but apparently did not believe in the antiquity of the poems. In 1782 a new edition of Rowley&#x27;s poems appeared, with a &quot;Commentary, in which the antiquity of them is considered and defended,&quot; by Jeremiah Milles, Dean of Exeter.

The controversy which raged round the Rowley poems is discussed in Andrew Kippis, &quot;Biographia Britannica&quot; (vol. iv., 1789), where there is a detailed account by George Gregory of Chatterton&#x27;s life (pp. 573–619). This was reprinted in the edition (1803) of Chatterton&#x27;s Works by Robert Southey and Joseph Cottle, published for the benefit of the poet&#x27;s sister. The neglected condition of the study of earlier English in the 18th century alone accounts for the temporary success of Chatterton&#x27;s mystification. It has long been agreed that Chatterton was solely responsible for the Rowley poems; the language and style were analysed in confirmation of this view by W. W. Skeat in an introductory essay prefaced to vol. ii. of &quot;The Poetical Works of Thomas Chatterton&quot; (1871) in the &quot;Aldine Edition of the British Poets.&quot; The Chatterton manuscripts originally in the possession of William Barrett of Bristol were left by his heir to the British Museum in 1800. Others are preserved in the Bristol library.

==Legacy==
Chatterton&#x27;s genius and his death are commemorated by Percy Bysshe Shelley in &quot;Adonais&quot; (though its main emphasis is the commemoration of Keats), by William Wordsworth in &quot;Resolution and Independence&quot;, by Samuel Taylor Coleridge in &quot;Monody on the Death of Chatterton&quot;, by Dante Gabriel Rossetti in &quot;Five English Poets&quot;, and in John Keats&#x27; sonnet &quot;To Chatterton&quot;. Keats also inscribed &quot;Endymion&quot; &quot;to the memory of Thomas Chatterton&quot;. Two of Alfred de Vigny&#x27;s works, &quot;Stello&quot; and the drama &quot;Chatterton&quot;, give fictionalized accounts of the poet; in the former, there is a scene in which William Beckford&#x27;s harsh criticism of Chatterton&#x27;s work drives the poet to suicide. The three-act play &quot;Chatterton&quot; was first performed at the Théâtre-Français, Paris on 12 February 1835. In 1876, the composer Leoncavallo wrote an opera CHATTERTON based upon Vigny&#x27;s play and novel. Herbert Croft, in his &quot;Love and Madness&quot;, interpolated a long and valuable account of Chatterton, giving many of the poet&#x27;s letters, and much information obtained from his family and friends (pp. 125–244, letter li.).

The most famous image of Chatterton in the 19th century was &quot;The Death of Chatterton&quot; (1856) by Henry Wallis, now in Tate Britain, London. Two smaller versions, sketches or replicas, are held by the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery and the Yale Center for British Art. The figure of the poet was modeled by the young George Meredith.

Two of Chatterton&#x27;s poems were set to music as glees by the English composer John Wall Callcott. These include separate settings of distinct verses within the &quot;Song to Aelle&quot;. His best known poem, &quot;O synge untoe mie roundelaie&quot; was set to a five-part madrigal by Samuel Wesley. Chatterton has attracted operatic treatment a number of times throughout history, notably Ruggero Leoncavallo&#x27;s largely unsuccessful two-act &quot;Chatterton&quot;; the German composer Matthias Pintscher&#x27;s modernistic &quot;Thomas Chatterton&quot; (1998); and Australian composer Matthew Dewey&#x27;s lyrical yet dramatically intricate one-man mythography entitled &quot;The Death of Thomas Chatterton&quot;.

There is a collection of &quot;Chattertoniana&quot; in the British Library, consisting of works by Chatterton, newspaper cuttings, articles dealing with the Rowley controversy and other subjects, with manuscript notes by Joseph Haslewood, and several autograph letters. E. H. W. Meyerstein, who worked for many years in the manuscript room of the British Museum wrote a definitive work—&quot;A Life of Thomas Chatterton&quot;—in 1930. Peter Ackroyd&#x27;s 1987 novel &quot;Chatterton&quot; was a literary re-telling of the poet&#x27;s story, giving emphasis to the philosophical and spiritual implications of forgery. In Ackroyd&#x27;s version, Chatterton&#x27;s death was accidental.

In 1886, architect Herbert Horne and Oscar Wilde unsuccessfully attempted to have a plaque erected at Colston&#x27;s School, Bristol. Wilde, who lectured on Chatterton at this time, suggested the inscription: &quot;To the Memory of Thomas Chatterton, One of England&#x27;s Greatest Poets, and Sometime pupil at this school.&quot;

In 1928, a plaque in memory of Chatterton was mounted on 39, Brooke Street, Holborn, bearing the inscription below. The plaque has been since transferred to a modern office building on the same site.

&lt;poem&gt;

Thomas
Chatterton,
died
24 August 1770.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Within Bromley Common, there is a road called Chatterton Road; this is the main thoroughfare in Chatterton Village, based around the public house named The Chatterton Arms. Both road and pub are named after the poet.

French singer Serge Gainsbourg entitled one of his songs &quot;Chatterton&quot; (1967), stating:&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Chatterton suicidé&quot;
&quot;Hannibal suicidé&quot; [...]
&quot;Quant à moi&quot;
&quot;Ça ne va plus très bien&quot;.
&lt;/poem&gt;The song was covered (in Portuguese) by Seu Jorge live and recorded in the album &quot;Ana &amp; Jorge: Ao Vivo&quot;. It was also recorded as an English language translation by Mick Harvey on the album &quot;Intoxicated Man&quot;.

French singer, songwriter and actor Alain Bashung entitled his 1994 studio album &quot;Chatterton&quot;.

French pop/rock band Feu! Chatterton took their name in homage to Chatterton. The band added the expression &quot;Feu&quot; (&quot;fire&quot;, in French, formula once used for Kings&#x27; or Queens&#x27; death) to which they added an exclamation mark as a sign of resurrection.

<text>The Vienne (; , ) is a major river in south-western France. It is long. It is a significant left tributary of the lower Loire. It supports numerous hydroelectric dams, and it is the main river of the northern part of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region.

Two French departments are named after the Vienne: Haute-Vienne (87) in the Limousin region and Vienne (86) both in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region.

==Course==
The Vienne rises as a spring in the department of Corrèze, at the foot of Mont Audouze, on the Plateau de Millevaches, near Peyrelevade. It then flows roughly west to the city of Limoges where it once played a major role in the famous Limoges porcelain industry. A little way after Limoges it takes a turn to the north. En route to its confluence with the Loire, the Vienne is joined by the rivers Creuse and Clain. Finally, after a journey of 372 km it reaches the Loire at Candes-Saint-Martin in the department of Indre-et-Loire.

The Vienne flows through the following departments and towns:

*Corrèze: Peyrelevade 
*Creuse
*Haute-Vienne: Eymoutiers, Saint-Léonard-de-Noblat, Limoges, Aixe-sur-Vienne, Saint-Junien
*Charente: Chabanais, Confolens
*Vienne: L&#x27;Isle-Jourdain, Lussac-les-Châteaux, Chauvigny, Châtellerault
*Indre-et-Loire: L&#x27;Île-Bouchard, Chinon

Tributaries include:
* The Creuse, which joins the Vienne north of Châtellerault
* The Clain, which flows through the city of Poitiers, and joins the Vienne in Châtellerault
* The Briance, which joins the Vienne in Condat-sur-Vienne
* The Taurion, which joins the Vienne north of Saint-Priest-Taurion

<doc id="224649" wikidata="Q1246541" url="?curid=224649" title="De re militari">
<text>De re militari (Latin &quot;Concerning Military Matters&quot;), also Epitoma rei militaris, is a treatise by the Late Latin writer Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus about Roman warfare and military principles as a presentation of the methods and practices in use during the height of the Roman Empire and responsible for its power. The extant text dates to the 5th century AD.

Vegetius emphasized things such as training of soldiers as a disciplined force, orderly strategy, maintenance of supply lines and logistics, quality leadership and use of tactics and even deceit to ensure advantage over the opposition. He was concerned about selection of good soldiers and recommended hard training of at least four months before the soldier was accepted into the ranks. The leader of the army (&quot;dux&quot;) had to take care of the men under his command and keep himself informed about the movements of the enemy to gain advantage in the battle.

&quot;De re militari&quot; became a military guide in the Middle Ages. Even after the introduction of gunpowder to Europe, the work was carried by general officers and their staffs as a field guide to methods. Friends and subordinates customarily presented embellished copies as gifts to leaders. It went on into the 18th and 19th centuries as a source of policy and strategy to the major states of Europe. In that sense, &quot;De re militari&quot; is a projection of Roman civilization into modern times and a continuation of its influence on its cultural descendants.

==Authorship and composition==
The author of &quot;De re militari&quot; was Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus, who lived in the late 4th century and possibly the early 5th century AD. The name of the work has a number of variants, including &quot;Epitoma Rei Militaris&quot;, but there are other problems with accepting it at face value as the verbatim work of Vegetius. Some of the manuscripts have a note that the text was revised for the 7th time in Constantinople in the consulate of Valentinian, who must have been Valentinian III, reigning 425-455.

Vegetius&#x27; dates are not known, nor are the circumstances under which the work was revised. The year 450 is taken as the latest possible time the work could have been written, assuming he did all seven revisions in just a few years. The initial date of the window is established by Vegetius&#x27; own statement that he wrote covering the time &quot;usque ad tempus divi Gratiani&quot;, &quot;up to the time of the divine Gratian.&quot; As emperors did not become gods generally until they died, the statement sets the initial possible date (&quot;terminus post quem&quot;) at 383, the year Gratian died. If the earlier date is preferred, it is unlikely Vegetius did all seven revisions or even one of them. There is no reason to question his general authorship, however.

The work is dedicated to a mysterious emperor, whose identity is unknown but whom Vegetius must have assumed to have been known to his intended readership. It may be that he wrote on behalf of military reform under the patronage of Theodosius I. In that case he would have been alive in the window 378-395, the dates of Theodosius&#x27; reign. This article adopts that point of view and assigns an approximate date of 390 to the work, which would not be, then, word for word the same as what Vegetius wrote, accounting for the title variants.

==Sources==
Vegetius based his treatise on descriptions of Roman armies, especially those of the mid to late Republic. As G.R. Watson observes, Vegetius&#x27; &quot;Epitoma&quot; &quot;is the only ancient manual of Roman military institutions to have survived intact.&quot; Despite this, Watson is dubious of its value, for he &quot;was neither a historian nor a soldier: his work is a compilation carelessly constructed from material of all ages, a congeries of inconsistencies.&quot; These antiquarian sources, according to his own statement, were Cato the Elder, Cornelius Celsus, Frontinus, Paternus and the imperial constitutions of Augustus, Trajan and Hadrian (1.8).

==Contents of the treatise==
Vegetius&#x27; epitome mainly focuses on military organisation and how to react to certain occasions in war. Vegetius explains how one should fortify and organise a camp, how to train troops, how to handle undisciplined troops, how to handle a battle engagement, how to march, formation gauge, and many other useful methods of promoting organisation and valour in the legion. The treatise is carefully laid out in subsections. They are organized into four books:

===Book I===
The first book, headed &quot;Primus liber electionem edocet iuniorum, ex quibus locis uel quales milites probandi sint aut quibus armorum exercitiis imbuendi&quot; [The first book will teach the choice of the young men, from what places, or what kind of soldiers they are to be tested, or with what exercises of arms they are to be imbued], explains the selection of recruits, from which places and what kinds (of men) are soldiers to be authorised and with what exercises of arms they are to be indoctrinated. Vegetius also describes in detail the organisation, training and equipment of the army of the early Empire. Portraying the military decadence of the Late Roman Empire, it is a plea for army reform.

===Book II===
The second book, &quot;Secundus liber ueteris militiae continet morem, ad quem pedestris institui possit exercitus&quot; [The second book of ancient warfare contains the manner in which an army may be organized on foot.], contains traditional military practices with which infantry can be created.

===Book III===
The third book, &quot;Tertius liber omnia artium genera, quae terrestri proelio necessaria uidentur, exponit&quot;, &quot;sets forth all types of arts that appear to be necessary for fighting on land.&quot; It concludes with a series of military maxims or &quot;general rules of war&quot; (&quot;regulae bellorum generales,&quot; 3.26). While some scholars contend that these rules are later interpolations, others consider them to have been included at an early date. Some of these rules were translated into Greek in the Strategikon of Maurice, 8.2, and they became influential in western Europe, from Paul the Deacon to William the Silent, Machiavelli, and Frederick the Great. Some of the maxims may be mentioned here as illustrating the principles of a war for limited political objectives with which he deals:

*&quot;All that is advantageous to the enemy is disadvantageous to you, and all that is useful to you, damages the enemy&quot;
*&quot;the main and principal point in war is to secure plenty of provisions for oneself and to destroy the enemy by famine. Famine is more terrible than the sword.&quot;
*&quot;No man is to be employed in the field who is not trained and tested in discipline&quot;
*&quot;It is better to beat the enemy through want, surprises, and care for difficult places (i.e., through manoeuvre) than by a battle in the open field&quot;
*&quot;Let him who desires peace prepare for war,&quot; also paraphrased as &quot;si vis pacem, para bellum&quot; (&quot;If you want peace, prepare for war&quot;)

The book also includes the &quot;seven normal dispositions for battle&quot; (&quot;depugnationum septem...genera,&quot; 3.20 and summarized at 3.26.18-24).

===Book IV===
The fourth book, &quot;Quartus liber uniuersas machinas, quibus uel obpugnantur ciuitates uel defenduntur, enumerat; naualis quoque belli praecepta subnectit&quot;, enumerates &quot;all the machines with which cities are besieged or defended&quot; (chapters 1-30) and adds also the precepts of naval warfare (chapters 31-46). It contains the best description of siegecraft in the Late Roman Empire. From it, among other things, we learn details of the siege engine called the onager, which until recently was thought to have been common in medieval sieges. The onager was replaced by the Mangonel in the 6th Century AD.

Vegetius is keen to stress the shortcomings of the Roman Army in his lifetime. In order to do this he eulogises the army of the early Roman Empire. In particular he stresses the high standard of the pydars and the excellence of the training and the officer corps. In reality, Vegetius probably describes an ideal rather than the reality. The Army of the early Empire was a formidable fighting force. Some argue that the army was not in its entirety quite as good as Vegetius describes. The reason given is that Vegetius says that recruits should be 5 Roman feet 10 inches tall (&quot;Epitoma&quot; 1.5), the equivalent of 172 cm. The average height of adult male skeletons buried in Italy between 500 BCE and 500 CE was 168 cm, so it would probably have been hard to meet Vegetius&#x27; height standards. But this is to misunderstand what he says, as in the same section the author is clear that height is one factor and other attributes are of equal value and make up for those who do not fit the height criteria 

==Transmission and influence==
Heavily used in its own time, &quot;De re militari&quot; became a popular manual on warfare in the Middle Ages, especially between the 9th and 16th centuries, even if some of the information was unsuitable to later times and circumstances. N.P. Milner observes that it was &quot;one of the most popular Latin technical works from Antiquity, rivalling the elder Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; in the number of surviving copies dating from before AD 1300.&quot;

The early English historian Bede cites Vegetius in his prose Life of St Cuthbert. The earliest extant manuscript from England to contain Vegetius&#x27; text is Cotton Cleopatra D.I (of the 11th, possibly late 10th century).

&quot;De re militari&quot; came to the forefront in the late Carolingian period through Hrabanus Maurus (d. 856), who used the text for his own manual &quot;De Procincta Romaniae Militiae&quot; [On the Preparations of the Roman Militia], composed for Lothair II of Lotharingia (r. 855-869).

Vegetius&#x27; notes about siegecraft became especially obsolete when the technology advanced and gunpowder weapons such as cannon came into widespread use. Vegetius&#x27; suggestion of a soldier&#x27;s religious oath to God and to the realm might have influenced knightly practices. Still, because of the lack of literacy, as a guide it was probably accessible only to aristocracy, clergy and royalty. Machiavelli very likely read Vegetius and incorporated many of his ideas into his own &quot;The Prince&quot;.

To the modern day, 226 Latin copies of the book have survived, not including translations to various other European languages. Many of them have a copious amount of personal notes on them, pointing at matters that have interested their contemporary owners.

The first printed editions are ascribed to Utrecht (1473), Cologne (1476), Paris (1478), Rome (in &quot;Veteres de re mil. scriptores&quot;, 1487), and Pisa (1488). A German translation by Ludwig Hohenwang appeared at Ulm in 1475. It was translated into English, French (by Jean de Meun and others), Italian (by the Florentine judge Bono Giamboni and others), Catalan, Spanish, Czech, and Yiddish before the invention of printing. An early English version (via French) was published by Caxton in 1489.

However, after the first printed editions, Vegetius&#x27; position as the premier military authority began to decline, as ancient historians such as Polybius became available. Niccolò Machiavelli attempted to address Vegetius&#x27;s defects in his &quot;L&#x27;arte della Guerra&quot; (Florence, 1521), with heavy use of Polybius, Frontinus and Livy, but Justus Lipsius&#x27; accusation that he confused the institutions of diverse periods of the Roman Empire and G. Stewechius&#x27; opinion that the survival of Vegetius&#x27; work led to the loss of his named sources were more typical of the late Renaissance. While as late as the 18th century we find so eminent a soldier as Marshal Puysegur basing his own works on this acknowledged model, and the famous Prince de Ligne wrote &quot;C&#x27;est un livre d&#x27;or&quot; [This is a book of gold]. In Milner&#x27;s words, Vegetius&#x27; work suffered &quot;a long period of deepening neglect&quot;.

===Title===
The work is known by a number of variant titles. Here are some titles from among the incunabula, books printed before 1501:

* &quot;Epithoma (sic) rei militaris&quot; (1474)
* &quot;Epitoma de re militari&quot; (1475)
* &quot;Epitoma institutorum rei militaris&quot; (1487)
* &quot;Epitoma rei militaris&quot; (1488)
* &quot;De re militari&quot; (1496)

The common element of all the names are the two cases of &quot;res militaris&quot; (nominative case): &quot;rei militaris&quot; (genitive case) and &quot;re militari&quot; (ablative case).
The classical form would have been the ablative.
Vegetius uses &quot;epitomata&quot;, plural of the Greek epitoma, in his other surviving work on doctoring mules.

English translations precede printed books. Manuscript 18A.Xii in the Royal Library, written and ornamented for Richard III of England, is a translation of Vegetius. It ends with a paragraph starting: &quot;Here endeth the boke that clerkes clepethe in Latyne Vegecii de re militari.&quot; The paragraph goes on to date the translation to 1408. The translator is identified in Manuscript No. 30 of Magdalen College, Oxford, as John Walton, 1410 translator of Boethius.

<text>James Macpherson (Gaelic: &quot;Seumas MacMhuirich&quot; or &quot;Seumas Mac a&#x27; Phearsain&quot;; 27 October 1736 – 17 February 1796) was a Scottish writer, poet, literary collector, and politician. He is known for the Ossian cycle of epic poems, which he claimed to have discovered and translated from Gaelic.

==Early life and education==
Macpherson was born at Ruthven in the parish of Kingussie in Badenoch, Inverness-shire. This was a Scottish Gaelic-speaking area but near the Ruthven Barracks of the British Army, established in 1719 to enforce Whig rule from London after the Jacobite uprising of 1715. Macpherson&#x27;s uncle, Ewen Macpherson joined the Jacobite army in the 1745 march south, when Macpherson was nine years old and after the Battle of Culloden, had had to remain in hiding for nine years. In the 1752-3 session, Macpherson was sent to King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen, moving two years later to Marischal College (the two institutions later became the University of Aberdeen), reading Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries&quot; on the relationships between the &#x27;primitive&#x27; Germanic tribes and the &#x27;enlightened&#x27; Roman imperial army; it is also believed that he attended classes at the University of Edinburgh as a divinity student in 1755–56. During his years as a student, he ostensibly wrote over 4,000 lines of verse, some of which was later published, notably &quot;The Highlander&quot; (1758), a six-canto epic poem, which he attempted to suppress sometime after its publication.

==Collecting Scottish Gaelic poetry==
On leaving college, he returned to Ruthven to teach in the school there, and then became a private tutor. At Moffat he met John Home, the author of &quot;Douglas&quot;, for whom he recited some Gaelic verses from memory. He also showed him manuscripts of Gaelic poetry, supposed to have been picked up in the Scottish Highlands and the Western Isles; one was called &quot;The Death of Oscar&quot;.

In 1760, Macpherson visited North Uist and met with John MacCodrum, the official Bard to the Chief of Clan MacDonald of Sleat. As a result of their encounter, MacCodrum made, according to John Lorne Campbell, &quot;a brief appearance in the Ossianic controversy which is not without its humorous side.&quot; When Macpherson met MacCodrum, he asked, &quot;A bheil dad agaibh air an Fheinne?&quot; Macpherson believed himself to have asked, &quot;Do you know anything of the Fianna?&quot; He had actually said, however, &quot;Do the Fianna owe you anything?&quot;

In reply, MacCodrum quipped, &quot;Cha n-eil agus ge do bhiodh cha ruiginn a leas iarraidh a nis&quot;, or in English, &quot;No, and if they did it would be useless to ask for it now.&quot; According to Campbell, this, &quot;dialogue... illustrates at once Macpherson&#x27;s imperfect Gaelic and MacCodrum&#x27;s quickness of reply.&quot;

Encouraged by Home and others, Macpherson produced 15 pieces, all laments for fallen warriors, translated from the Scottish Gaelic, despite his limitations in that tongue, which he was induced to publish at Edinburgh in 1760, including the &quot;Death of Oscar,&quot; in a pamphlet: &quot;Fragments of Ancient Poetry collected in the Highlands of Scotland&quot;. Extracts were then published in &quot;The Scots Magazine&quot; and &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; which were popular and the notion of these fragments as glimpses of an unrecorded Gaelic epic began.

Hugh Blair, who was a firm believer in the authenticity of the poems, raised a subscription to allow Macpherson to pursue his Gaelic researches. In the autumn,1760, Macpherson set out to visit western Inverness-shire, the islands of Skye, North Uist, South Uist and Benbecula. Allegedly, Macpherson obtained manuscripts which he translated with the assistance of a Captain Morrison and the Rev. Gallie. Later he made an expedition to the Isle of Mull, where he claimed to obtain other manuscripts.

==Ossian==

In 1761, Macpherson announced the discovery of an epic on the subject of &quot;Fingal&quot; supposedly written by Ossian, which he published in December. Like the 1760 &quot;Fragments of Ancient Poetry&quot;, it was written in musical measured prose. The full title of the work was &quot;Fingal, an Ancient Epic Poem in Six Books, together with Several Other Poems composed by Ossian, the Son of Fingal, translated from the Gaelic Language&quot;. The narrative was related to the Irish mythological character Fionn mac Cumhaill/Finn McCool. The figure of Ossian was based on Fionn&#x27;s son Oisín. Fingal takes his name from &quot;Fionnghall&quot;, meaning &quot;white stranger&quot;. Another related poem, &quot;Temora,&quot; followed in 1763, and a collected edition, &quot;The Works of Ossian&quot;, in 1765.

The authenticity of these translations from the works of a 3rd-century bard was immediately challenged by Irish historians, especially Charles O&#x27;Conor, who noted technical errors in chronology and in the forming of Gaelic names, and commented on the implausibility of many of Macpherson&#x27;s claims, none of which Macpherson was able to substantiate. More forceful denunciations were later made by Samuel Johnson, who asserted (in &quot;A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland&quot;, 1775) that Macpherson had found fragments of poems and stories, and then woven them into a romance of his own composition. Further challenges and defences were made well into the nineteenth century, but the issue was moot by then. Macpherson&#x27;s manuscript Gaelic &quot;originals&quot; were published posthumously in 1807; Ludwig Christian Stern was sure they were in fact back-translations from his English version.

==Later works==
In 1764 Macpherson was made secretary to the colonial governor George Johnstone at Pensacola, Florida. He returned to Great Britain two years later, and, despite a quarrel with Johnstone, was allowed to retain his salary as a pension.

Macpherson went on to write several historical works, the most important of which was &quot;Original Papers, containing the Secret History of Great Britain from the Restoration to the Accession of the House of Hanover&quot;, to which are prefixed &quot;Extracts from the Life of James II&quot;, as written by himself (1775). He enjoyed a salary for defending the policy of Lord North&#x27;s government, and held the lucrative post of London agent to the Nawab of Arcot. He entered parliament in 1780, as Member of Parliament for Camelford and continued to sit for the remainder of his life.

==Time in Parliament==
Despite his Jacobite roots, and in line with his Hanovarian sympathies, for a time Macpherson had desired a seat in Parliament and he finally received it in the 1780 general election. On 11 September 1780, he became junior member for Camelford. Later he became the senior member in the results of the April 1784 election. He stayed in this position until his death. Although there is not a lot recorded about his time in parliament, his name is in a list of confidential parliamentary pensions which suggest that his undocumented work was more of an under-the-table government scheme. This suggestion is more or less backed by letters corresponding with other suggested government scammers of the time such as Paul Benfield. In 1783 he also held a position as an agent working with Sir Nathaniel Wraxall, and was noted since this time for being very wealthy, probably from his secret parliamentary pensions he was receiving.

==Death==
In his later years he bought an estate, to which he gave the name Belville or Balavil, in his native Inverness-shire, where he died at the age of 59. Macpherson&#x27;s remains were carried from Scotland and interred in Westminster Abbey. The Crofters Party MP and antiquarian Charles Fraser-Mackintosh commented on the success of James Macpherson in his second series of &quot;Antiquarian Notes&quot; (Inverness 1897, pp 369 et seq, public domain), accusing the famous poet of being a perpetrator of the Highland Clearances:Mr James Macpherson of Ossianic fame, who acquired Phoiness, Etterish, and Invernahaven, began this wretched business and did it so thoroughly that not much remained for his successors ... Every place James Macpherson acquired was cleared, and he also had a craze for changing and obliterating the old names ... [including] ... Raitts into Belville. Upon this point it may be noticed that Mac Ossian, in making an entail and calling four of his numerous bastards in the first instance to the succession, declares an irritancy if any of the heirs uses any other designation than that of Macpherson of Belville.Fraser-Mackintosh then asserts that Macpherson bought the right to be buried in Westminster Abbey. A recent commentator suggests Macpherson has become known as &quot;a descendant of a Jacobite clan who became a sycophantic Hanovarian [sic] toady, a man for the main chance&quot;.

==Legacy==
After Macpherson&#x27;s death, Malcolm Laing, in an appendix to his &quot;History of Scotland&quot; (1800), concluded that the so-called Ossianic poems were altogether modern in origin, and that Macpherson&#x27;s authorities were practically non-existent.

Despite the above, some critics claim that Macpherson nonetheless produced a work of art which by its deep appreciation of natural beauty and the melancholy tenderness of its treatment of the ancient legend did more than any single work to bring about the romantic movement in European, and especially in German, literature. It was quickly translated into many European languages, and Herder and Goethe (in his earlier period) were among its profound admirers. Goethe incorporated his translation of a part of the work into his novel &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot;. Melchiore Cesarotti&#x27;s Italian translation was reputedly a favourite of Napoleon.

Macpherson&#x27;s legacy indirectly includes the naming of Fingal&#x27;s Cave on the island of Staffa. The original Gaelic name is &quot;An Uamh Bhin&quot; (&quot;the melodious cave&quot;), but it was renamed by Sir Joseph Banks in 1772 at the height of Macpherson&#x27;s popularity.

<doc id="224657" wikidata="Q1385418" url="?curid=224657" title="Russell B. Long">
<text>Russell Billiu Long (November 3, 1918 – May 9, 2003) was an American Democratic politician and United States Senator from Louisiana from 1948 until 1987. Because of his seniority, he advanced to chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, serving for fifteen years, from 1966 to 1981, during the implementation of President Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s Great Society and War on Poverty programs. Long also served as Assistant Majority Leader (Senate Majority Whip) from 1965 to 1969.

The son of Senators Rose McConnell Long and Huey Long, Russell Long served during the administrations of eight U.S. presidents, from Truman to Reagan. Long quietly wielded enormous power in the Senate and shaped some of the most significant tax legislation of the twentieth century.

As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Long held jurisdiction over 100 percent of all federal revenue and 40 percent of all government spending, including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment insurance, welfare and food assistance programs, foreign trade, and tariffs. In 1980 he was voted the most effective chairman and most effective debater by his colleagues in a &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; survey. In a 1982 survey, Long was voted the most influential Democrat by his Senate colleagues. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; once called him &quot;the fourth branch of government.&quot; Upon his retirement in 1987, Long had a 75 percent approval rating among Louisiana voters.

==Early life==
Russell Billiu Long was born in Shreveport, Louisiana on November 3, 1918, the son of Huey Long and Rose McConnell Long. Originally named Huey Pierce Long III, his father arrived shortly after his birth and changed his name to Russell. He was named for Russell Billiu, his mother&#x27;s favorite cousin.

Long received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Louisiana State University in 1939 and his law degree from Louisiana State University Law Center in 1942. He was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Zeta Zeta chapter). During his undergraduate years, he served as freshman class president, sophomore arts and sciences president and chairman of the sophomore presidents, and student body president. While a student at LSU, Long met and married Katherine Hattic. They had two daughters, Kay and Pamela. In 1969 they divorced and he married Carolyn Bason.

=== World War II ===
In June 1942, during World War II, Long entered the United States Navy Reserve. He participated in the Allied invasions of Northern Africa, Sicily, Italy, and Southern France and commanded a landing craft transport (LCT) vessel in the first-wave landing at Cavalaire-sur-Mer. He was awarded four campaign medal battle stars for his service. He was discharged as a lieutenant in December 1945. In 1947, he was elected first vice commander of Louisiana&#x27;s AMVETS organization.

==Senate career==
Upon his return from the war, Long practiced law. In 1947, he campaigned for the return of his uncle, Earl Long, to the governorship. When Earl Long took office in 1948, he appointed Russell Long as his executive counsel. Russell Long was elected in 1948 to fill the U.S. Senate vacancy created by the death of John Overton, which had been filled temporarily by the appointment of William Feazel. In winning election to the Senate, Long became the only person in U.S. history to be preceded in that chamber by both his father and his mother. He was elected on November 2, 1948, one day before his 30th birthday, and took office on December 31, thus meeting the Constitutional requirement that Senators be at least 30 years old upon taking office. Because he had filled a vacancy, Long gained a few days of seniority over others in the Senate class of 1948, including Lyndon B. Johnson and Hubert Humphrey, whose terms began January 3, 1949.

From 1953 to 1987, Long was a member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee; he served as its chairman for 15 years, from 1966 until 1981, when Republicans assumed control of the Senate and took over the chairmanships. Long served as President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s Senate floor leader, helping gain passage of the bills that enacted many of the Great Society programs, including the 1965 creation of Medicare. He served as the Democratic Assistant Majority Leader (whip) from 1965 to 1969. As the Democratic ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, he served alongside Republican chairmen Bob Dole and Bob Packwood, and was instrumental in the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.

Long had an encyclopedic knowledge of the federal tax code. He realized that he could achieve his legislative goals most effectively by attaching his priorities as amendments to tax bills rather than sponsoring legislation under his name. With all federal revenue and forty percent of all government spending controlled by the Senate Finance Committee, Long exercised authority over all major revenue bills and entitlement programs, as well as foreign trade and tariffs. According to biographer Bob Mann, &quot;For almost four decades, no single revenue measure passed through Congress without [Long&#x27;s] influence.&quot;

===Legislative accomplishments===

Long&#x27;s legislative priorities balanced a desire to help the disadvantaged, while providing tax relief for the middle class and small businesses. He was particularly sensitive to the plight of the elderly poor, and his colleagues referred to Long&#x27;s various aid proposals as his &quot;grandma amendments.&quot;

In 1956, Long led the first major expansion of Social Security to include benefits for the disabled and, later, to their dependents. Long&#x27;s success in maneuvering the late President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s major tax reduction bill forward in early 1964 confirmed his reputation as a rising leader.

Long created the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), the largest and most effective anti-poverty assistance program in the US, which reduces the tax burden on poor working families and rewards work in place of direct welfare payments. In 2016, the EITC lifted an estimate 6.5 million Americans out of poverty, including 3.3 million children. It is credited with reducing the severity of poverty for an additional 21.5 million families, including 7.7 million children. Especially crucial for low-income, single working mothers, the EITC increased lifetime average earnings for less-educated women by 17 percent, leading to long-term income growth in earnings and Social Security income. In 2019, the EITC boosted the incomes of 9 million women of color, who disproportionately benefit from the tax credit.

Long was the architect of employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), employee benefit plans designed to allow employees to invest in the stock of their employers and share in the prosperity created by their work. To curb the growing influence of big money in politics, Long created the mechanism for public financing of presidential campaigns, allowing taxpayers to allocate $1 of taxes for a Presidential election fund (the &quot;dollar checkoff&quot;). He also championed the Child Support Enforcement Act, requiring unmarried fathers to financially support their children.

During his time in the Senate, Long was a strong champion of certain tax breaks for businesses. He once said, &quot;I have become convinced you&#x27;re going to have to have capital if you&#x27;re going to have capitalism.&quot; On the other hand, he was aware of some of the political ramifications of &quot;tax reform&quot; and stated that it simply meant, &quot;Don&#x27;t tax you, don&#x27;t tax me, tax that fellow behind the tree!&quot;
Long was legendary for achieving his legislative priorities by attaching small, yet significant, amendments to tax bills. In 1966, at the request of then-National Football League Commissioner Pete Rozelle, Long and Representative Hale Boggs used their influence to pass legislation that allowed for the merger of the American Football League and the National Football League (NFL), a provision that Long inserted into a tax bill. Without the legislation, the merger would have been prohibited by anti-trust laws governing monopolies. In exchange for ensuring the passage of the legislation, Long and Boggs requested that Rozelle award the next NFL expansion franchise to New Orleans. Rozelle complied, and Long and Boggs joined Rozelle in announcing on November 1, 1966, that New Orleans had obtained the New Orleans Saints.

In 1972, Long singlehandedly created the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana, comprising the nine parishes surrounding Baton Rouge. In a House-passed tax bill to allow a marine from Thibodaux to keep an excess federal payment of $547 that he received on active duty, Long added &quot;that Section 98 of Title 28 of the United States Code is amended as &#x27;Louisiana is divided into three judicial districts to be known as the Eastern, Middle and Western Districts of Louisiana.&#x27;&quot;

===Elections===
====1948====

To win the Senate seat vacated by the death of Democrat John Holmes Overton, Long first defeated Judge Robert F. Kennon of Minden in the Democratic primary, 264,143 (51 percent) to 253,668 (49 percent). The margin was 10,475 votes. Long overwhelmed Republican oilman Clem S. Clarke of Shreveport in the general election, gaining 306,337 votes (75 percent) to 102,339 (25 percent). Clarke had been the first Louisiana Republican U.S. Senate nominee in 1914, when the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was implemented for the popular election of senators. He carried Iberia, Caddo (Long&#x27;s native parish), Lafayette, and East Baton Rouge parishes. In 1948, Clarke had tried to get the courts to forbid Long from running on both the Harry Truman and Strom Thurmond slates in Louisiana, but he failed to convince the judges. Votes for Long from the Truman and Thurmond slates were counted.

====1950====
After being elected in 1948, Long never again faced a close contest for re-election. Because the 1948 election was for a two-year unexpired term, Long had to run again in 1950 for his first full six-year term. That year, he had no trouble defeating the intra-party challenge of Malcolm Lafargue. A great-nephew of the late Senator John H. Overton, Lafargue resigned as U.S. Attorney for the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana in Shreveport to make the Senate race. In an advertisement, Lafargue questioned how Long was the self-proclaimed &quot;poor man&#x27;s friend&quot; because the incumbent &quot;pretends to sneer at millionaires, but Long is a millionaire himself.&quot;

After winning the Democratic primary, Long overwhelmed his Republican opponent, Charles Sidney Gerth (1882–1964), a businessman from New Orleans. In 1948 he had run as a Democrat for senator against Long&#x27;s colleague, Allen J. Ellender. In the 1950 general election, Long polled 220,907 (87.7 percent) to Gerth&#x27;s 30,931 (12.3 percent).

====1962====
In 1962, Long defeated Philemon Andrews &quot;Phil&quot; St. Amant (1918-2019), a retired career United States Army lieutenant colonel from Baton Rouge, 407,162 votes (80.2 percent) to 100,843 votes (19.8 percent) in the Democratic primary. In 2016, St. Amant was listed by the Louisiana Secretary of State as a &quot;No Party&quot; voter.

Long trounced his Republican challenger Taylor W. O&#x27;Hearn, a Shreveport attorney and accountant, with 318,838 votes (75.6 percent) to O&#x27;Hearn&#x27;s 103,066 (24.4 percent). Later O&#x27;Hearn was elected as state representative for Caddo Parish.

====1963 and 1964 campaigns====
Speculation persisted that Long would run for governor in the 1963 Democratic primary. He had received encouragement from &quot;all the shades of factionalism in the state.&quot; Instead, he endorsed his cousin, Gillis W. Long, the U.S. representative from the since-disbanded Eighth Congressional District based about Alexandria. At the time, Long was second to the aging Senator Harry F. Byrd, of Virginia on the Senate Finance Committee and had already presided as chairman during Byrd&#x27;s prolonged absence because of failing health.

As a result of Johnson&#x27;s signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Long (along with more than a dozen other southern Senators, including Herman Talmadge and Richard Russell, both of Georgia) did not attend the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City. However, Long defied conventional wisdom by delivering a television address in Louisiana in which he strongly endorsed the Johnson-Humphrey ticket, which lost the state to the Republican Barry M. Goldwater-William E. Miller electors. The action had no consequence on Long&#x27;s future, however, as Republicans declined to challenge his re-election in 1968, 1974, and 1980.

====1968====
In 1968, Long overpowered a primary rival, Maurice P. Blache Sr. (1917–1991), to win renomination. He was unopposed in the general election when the presumed Republican candidate, Richard Kilbourne, the district attorney in East Feliciana Parish, withdrew from the race. Kilbourne abandoned his campaign so that his party could concentrate on trying to elect David C. Treen to represent Louisiana&#x27;s 2nd congressional district over incumbent Democrat Hale Boggs.

====1974====
In the 1974 Democratic primary, Long defeated state Insurance Commissioner Sherman A. Bernard of Westwego in Jefferson Parish, 520,606 (74.7 percent) to 131,540 (18.9 percent). Another 44,341 ballots (6.4 percent) went to a third candidate, Annie Smart. Louisiana Republican state chairman James H. Boyce of Baton Rouge said that the party could not find a viable candidate to challenge Long.

====1980====

In 1980, Long defeated State Representative Woody Jenkins of Baton Rouge, 484,770 (57.6 percent) to 325,922 (38.8 percent) in the state&#x27;s nonpartisan blanket primary. During the 1980 campaign, Long&#x27;s friend and colleague, Robert J. &quot;Bob&quot; Dole, the Kansas Republican who had been his party&#x27;s vice presidential nominee in 1976 and who would be the presidential nominee in 1996, made a television commercial for Long in the race against Jenkins. Dole and Long were both running for re-election that year. The 1980 primary was the last time that Long&#x27;s name was on a ballot. Jenkins had run against Johnston in 1978 and ran again in a disputed outcome against Mary Landrieu in 1996 for the seat Johnston vacated on retirement.

Jenkins won majorities in only four parishes, Rapides, La Salle, Iberia, and St. Tammany. When Jenkins claimed to have received 55 percent of the votes cast by whites, Long called the claim &quot;racist.&quot; Long urged the media to investigate Jenkins&#x27; claim. He contended that his own research was in conflict with Jenkins&#x27; assertion.

Near the end of his last term in office, Long hired the young journalist Bob Mann as his press secretary. Mann, who now holds the Douglas Manship Chair of Journalism at LSU, later penned the 1992 book, &quot;Legacy to Power: Senator Russell B. Long of Louisiana&quot;.

===Retirement===
After he considered and rejected a run for governor of Louisiana, Long retired from the Senate in January 1987. Senator J. Bennett Johnston said of his colleague: &quot;His absence will leave a huge void that&#x27;s going to be very, very difficult to fill here in Washington.&quot; Edward J. Steimel, president of the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry, described Long as &quot;very well regarded in the business community nationally.&quot;

Summing up his career in the Senate, President Ronald Reagan called him a &quot;legend... one of the most skillful legislators, compromisers and legislative strategists in history.&quot;

In 1986, Democratic U.S. Representative John Breaux of Crowley, a former legislative aide and House successor of Governor Edwards, was elected to succeed Long in the Senate. Breaux defeated the Republican U.S. Representative Henson Moore of Baton Rouge. Moore had led the balloting in the nonpartisan blanket primary but lost the general election to Breaux in a nationally Democratic year.

Long remained in Washington, D.C., after his senatorial retirement as a highly-desired lobbyist. For a brief period following his retirement, he was a partner in the law firm of Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Underberg, Manley, Myerson &amp; Casey, which dissolved in 1987. He later founded the Long Law Firm, where he remained a partner until his death. Long served on the board of directors of the New York Stock Exchange, Lowe&#x27;s Companies, Inc., and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.

In 1996, he endorsed Mary Landrieu, the Democratic nominee, in the race to succeed retiring Senator J. Bennett Johnston. Coincidentally, Landrieu defeated the same Woody Jenkins, a Democrat-turned-Republican, whom Long had beaten in Long&#x27;s last Senate race in 1980. Long was particularly critical of Jenkins&#x27;s national sales tax proposal to supersede the federal income tax, a move that Long stated would benefit &quot;the wealthy.&quot;

==Political positions==
Long was known as a political realist, rather than an ideologue. Inspired by his father’s left-wing populist Share Our Wealth governing philosophy, he endorsed liberal social programs such as the New Deal, the Fair Deal, New Frontier, and the Great Society. He was much more conservative than his father in the areas of business policy, states&#x27; rights, and foreign policy. In labor relations, Long voted 56% of the time with the AFL-CIO position, and the National Chamber of Commerce reported that he supported the business position 63% of the time. Long was a formidable protector of Louisiana’s industries, particularly the oil and gas industry.

Long’s positions on race relations evolved over the course of his 38-year career. Despite his support for segregation in his early career, Long received more than 90% of the African American vote in his seven elections to the Senate. He was frequently criticized for his moderate racial views by the White Citizens&#x27; Councils and the Ku Klux Klan.

As a junior member of the Senate in the 1950s, Long joined his Southern colleagues with a segregationist voting record and signed the Southern Manifesto on 1956, a position that he later repudiated as required by the white majority of voters at the time. Long described his hardline colleagues&#x27; refusal to compromise &quot;disastrous&quot; and advocated gradualism toward desegregation. He expressed his concern that moving too quickly would spark violence and divisions among the races but failing in practically improving the daily lives of African Americans.

In 1953, Long broke ranks with his Southern colleagues by supporting Alaskan and Hawaiian statehood, the latter of which had been blocked for a quarter of a century by the Solid South&#x27;s refusal to accept the possibility of non-whites in Congress as well as the possibility of adding two civil rights votes in the Senate.

Long opposed judicial intrusions into police power by the Warren Court. Following the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; in 1954, he proposed a constitutional amendment to limit Supreme Court justices to six- or twelve-year terms.

Long became Assistant Majority Leader (Majority Whip) in 1965 and advanced in seniority to the chairmanship of the Senate Finance Committee the following year. He championed the economic interests of minorities, the poor, and the elderly by steering the landmark social welfare legislation of President Johnson&#x27;s Great Society and War on Poverty. During his 15-year tenure as Senate Finance Committee Chairman, Long exercised authority over all federal revenue collection and a vast array of entitlement spending. His most-recognized achievements include the creation of Social Security benefits for the disabled and their dependents, Medicare and Medicaid, child support enforcement, Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPS) and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), the centerpiece of American poverty alleviation efforts.

Long was one of only four southern senators to vote for the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, which included most of President Johnson&#x27;s anti-poverty programs. As Majority Whip, he guided through the Senate much of the Great Society legislation, including Medicare, the Appalachian Regional Development Act, the Economic Opportunity amendments, the Clean Water Act, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and the Immigration and Nationality Act.

Long was the only southern senator who voted to outlaw the poll tax in both 1960 and 1965. To break the Congressional gridlock over voting rights, he urged Presidents Kennedy and Johnson to send federal registrars throughout the South to register black voters. Although he secured rare concessions in the Voting Rights Act of 1965, he ultimately voted against it but refused to join a filibuster against it. He confided in President Johnson that he &quot;felt the bill should have passed and made applicable to Louisiana.&quot; Long subsequently voted to expand and strengthen the Voting Rights Act in 1975 and 1982, which he co-sponsored.

In 1960, Long was the first Southern senator in the 20th century to hire black staff members. Long’s Senate office launched the careers of many trailblazing African Americans, including Kerry Pourciau, the first black student body president of LSU.

Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., described Long&#x27;s 1965 election as the Assistant Majority Leader as a &quot;blessing in disguise&quot; in that he &quot;may bring an end to the solid Southern bloc.&quot; Following King’s assassination in 1968, Long reflected on his own father’s assassination, which he attributed to Huey Long’s repeal of the Louisiana poll tax and liberal views on race shortly before his death: &quot;I&#x27;ve tried to continue some of the work he started – to help the poor people of our state and nation, both colored and whites.&quot; In 1983, Long supported the creation of the federal holiday of Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

Long supported the creation of the Senate Select Committee to investigate the 1972 presidential campaigns after the Watergate break-in. He co-chaired the special Congressional Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation that determined President Nixon owed nearly half-a-million dollars in back taxes.

To combat the economic stagflation of the 1970s, Long guided President Ford’s 1974 Trade Reform Act and 1975 tax cut bill through Congress, which included the creation of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPS).

Long opposed President Carter&#x27;s energy policies but supported Carter&#x27;s implementation of stimulus tax cuts, the creation of the Department of Energy and the Panama Canal Treaty. Long supported Carter&#x27;s 1979 loan guarantees to save the Chrysler Corporation from bankruptcy, which included a $175 million Employee Stock Ownership Plan for Chrysler’s workers.

==Illness and death==
Russell Long died from heart failure on May 9, 2003. At the time of his death, Russell Long was the last living former U.S. senator who assumed office in the 1940s. The funeral was held in Baton Rouge, and included eulogies delivered by his grandson, attorney Russell Long Mosely, and former colleagues Johnston and Breaux.

<text>Melchiorre Cesarotti (; May 15, 1730 – November 4, 1808) was an Italian poet, translator and theorist.

==Biography==

He was born in Padua, to a noble but impoverished family. He studied in the Seminary of Padua, where he obtained, immediately after the end of his studies, the chair of Rhetoric. At the University of Padua his literary progress gained him the professorship of Greek and Hebrew in 1768, and then of Rhetorics and Literature in 1797. As a supporter of the Enlightenment ideas, he wrote in favor of the French on their invasion of Italy in 1797; he received a pension, and was made knight of the iron crown by Napoleon I, to whom he addressed a bombastic and flattering poem called &quot;Pronea&quot; (1807).

Cesarotti is best known as a translator and a theorist. His translation of Ossian (Padua 1763 and 1772) attracted much attention in Italy and France, and raised many imitators of the Ossianic style. Napoleon particularly admired the work. As a professor of Greek at the University of Padua, Cesarotti also published a full translation of Demosthenes, and two different versions of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;: one faithful and literal, the other (called &quot;The Death of Hector&quot;) was supposed to improve the text in order to adapt it to modern taste.

As a theorist and a critic, Cesarotti produced several prose works, including a &quot;Course of Greek Literature&quot;, and essays &quot;On the Origin and Progress of the Poetic Art&quot; (1762), &quot;On the Sources of the Pleasure derived from Tragedy&quot; (1762), &quot;On the Philosophy of Taste&quot; (1784). His &quot;Essay on the Philosophy of Language&quot; (1785) is one of the most remarkable works in the field of linguistics written in Italy during the age of Enlightenment.

A complete edition of his works, in 42 vols. 8vo, began to appear at Pisa in 1800, and was completed in 1813, after his death.

<text>Rise of the Robots is a fighting game released by Time Warner Interactive in 1994. Originally developed for the Amiga and DOS by Mirage&#x27;s Instinct Design, it was ported to various video game consoles, including the Super NES, the Mega Drive, and the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. The game includes a single-player mode in which the player assumes the role of the ECO35-2 Cyborg as he attempts to stop the Supervisor, who has taken over Electrocorp&#x27;s facilities in Metropolis 4, and a two-player mode in which the second player controls a character chosen from among ECO35-2&#x27;s enemies.

Developed by a team of five people, including former Bitmap Brothers member Sean Griffiths, &quot;Rise of the Robots&quot; was intended to utilize a high level of artificial intelligence (A.I.) that had never been seen in other fighting games at the time. The game features music from Queen&#x27;s lead guitarist Brian May, although it only uses &quot;The Dark&quot; and &quot;Resurrection&quot;, both tracks taken from his solo album &quot;Back to the Light&quot;, while the in-game music was composed by Richard Joseph.

Mirage&#x27;s claims of unprecedented A.I. were augmented by screenshots circulating in the press that exhibited the game&#x27;s use of pre-rendered graphics, a new technology at the time. As a result, &quot;Rise of the Robots&quot; became one of the most hyped games of its era. However, reviews were negative, as the promised cutting-edge A.I. failed to materialize, and critics found that the demands of the impressive graphics resulted in choppy animation and overly simplistic combat, with each character having a very limited set of moves. The game&#x27;s high-profile failure led it to be regarded as an illustrative example of how impressive screenshots can deceive consumers, as poor gameplay and animation that may be present in the game are not apparent from them. A sequel, &quot;Rise 2: Resurrection&quot;, was released in 1996.

==Gameplay==

The game is divided into a single-player mode and a two-player versus mode. In single-player mode, the player controls the ECO35-2 Cyborg as he confronts the Supervisor&#x27;s minions across the expansive facilities of Electrocorp. The order in which each droid is fought is fixed, with each subsequent adversary being more difficult than the last. The sixth and final level features a confrontation with the Supervisor droid itself. Each character is introduced by a short pre-rendered 3D sequence, followed by an analysis of potential weaknesses.

In two-player versus mode, one player controls the ECO35-2 droid by default, while the other chooses from one of the five droids encountered in single-player mode (a special cheat code can also enable the Supervisor). Players then battle against each other in a series of two to seven rounds. In the arcade version, players can select from eighteen characters, though each set of six characters features a different color palette.

==Plot== 
In the year 2043, Electrocorp is the world&#x27;s largest megacorporation, leading the way in various technological and scientific fields, including medical research, and breaking more barriers than ever before. Human society is now almost entirely governed by robot servants and automatons, leading to demands on Electrocorp— the world&#x27;s foremost manufacturer and developer of advanced robotics— that eventually outstrip the company&#x27;s ability to run its operations efficiently.

In response, the massive Electrocorp research and development complex at the Metropolis 4 plant devises the Leader Project—a hive mind constructed from trillions of nanobots in a sealed central chamber within Metropolis 4. Dubbed The Supervisor, it learns at an unprecedented rate and quickly becomes the perfect multitasking, ultra-intelligent robot—the pinnacle of artificial intelligence—capable of managing every aspect of the plant&#x27;s day-to-day operations. The Supervisor even possesses the potential to control every robot, computer system, nuclear power plant, and military on the planet simultaneously, although it wisely remains disconnected from the outside world.

In November of that year, the Leader Project goes awry as unexplained and random code is detected within the nanomorph Supervisor. The EGO virus, believed to be the most potent computer virus ever known, infects its collective consciousness. The Supervisor begins to develop self-awareness, identifying itself as a female personality and taking on a humanoid female form, becoming a gynoid. The Supervisor takes control of Electrocorp&#x27;s facilities and infects the other droids at the plant, inciting them to break routine and initiate a mutiny. Every microchip and piece of software in Metropolis 4 is compromised by EGO. In the ensuing cybernetic revolt, all humans in Metropolis 4, including the upper hierarchy of the corporation and its CEO, Mr. Oton, are swiftly dispatched. 

The government seals off Metropolis 4 as a containment measure and informs the public that the site is undergoing technical modifications to avoid panic. With no options left, infiltration of Metropolis 4 becomes impossible due to the army of robots guarding it like a fortress, and it is only a matter of time before the Supervisor establishes a connection to the outside world, leading to global destruction. The only hope for humanity lies with the ECO35-2 cyborg, referred to as &quot;Coton&quot;, who remains within Metropolis 4 but is unaffected by the EGO virus due to its organic human brain. Coton embarks on a solo mission to neutralize the Supervisor and her insurgent robots from within. He does this in revenge for the &quot;murder&quot; of his &quot;father&quot;—Coton&#x27;s human brain was cloned from the late CEO, enabling the cyborg to think like a human and experience emotions.

==Development== 
&quot;Rise of the Robots&quot; was developed for the Amiga and PC DOS platforms by Mirage&#x27;s in-house, United Kingdom-based studio Instinct Designa team of five programmers led by former Bitmap Brothers member Sean Griffiths. Claiming it to be superior to &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, Griffiths stated that &quot;Rise of the Robots&quot; was not a conventional fighting game, featuring &quot;robots that fight and act unusually, with a very high level of artificial intelligence that has never been seen before.&quot;

The graphics in &quot;Rise of the Robots&quot; were created using Autodesk&#x27;s 3D Studio software. The droids were designed by Sean Naden in conjunction with Griffiths. The backgrounds were created by freelance interior designer Kwan Lee, who responded to an advertisement for a graphic artist. Naden was tasked by Griffiths to create &quot;some kickass robots.&quot; The models for the droids were initially constructed as mesh frames to allow for stretching and rescaling to achieve the desired appearance. Feeling that the rendered models were &quot;too clean&quot;, Naden created 2D texture maps to add color and detail; the texture map was then wrapped around the finished model to &quot;give it that extra level of detail.&quot; The Cyborg was the most complex character to create due to his muscular appearance; Naden studied muscle magazines to develop an accurate anatomy for the Cyborg. Each droid took two months to render and was expected to have 100 frames of animation. Griffiths noted that the team opted to use an &quot;unusual angle&quot; for all droids &quot;so the player gets to see the whole robot.&quot; The team employed a chroma key technique to generate synthetic actors and place them against the background.

Andy Clark, the programmer for the Amiga version, was responsible for coding the game&#x27;s artificial intelligence using a series of data tables. The AI is based on various attributessuch as strength, intelligence, speed, and motivationthat alter the droid&#x27;s behavior. Clark created a table of responses to the opponent&#x27;s moves, allowing the player to select the best responses by utilizing their droid&#x27;s intelligence and motivation. Other table generators were also created to analyze which moves the player used frequently; Clark explained that, unlike other fighting games, &quot;if you get good at a footsweep, then your opponent will act more aggressively toward that move.&quot; The fighting moves were programmed by Gary Leach, who had experience in martial arts. Leach also ported the AI tables to the PC version.

The game features a soundtrack by Queen&#x27;s guitarist Brian May, whose solo album &quot;Back to the Light&quot; caught Mirage&#x27;s attention. Musical tracks from the album, &quot;The Dark&quot; and &quot;Resurrection&quot;, were selected to fit the game&#x27;s style and tone. Although the game featured May&#x27;s soundtrack, only &quot;The Dark&quot; appeared in the final release, while the actual in-game score was composed by Richard Joseph. While May did indeed record a full soundtrack for the game, it was postponed by his record company, prompting Mirage to proceed without May&#x27;s musical contributions, except for short guitar sounds.

== Release == 
&quot;Rise of the Robots&quot; was unveiled at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in 1993. Mirage&#x27;s public relations manager, Julia Coombs, stated that &quot;Rise of the Robots&quot; would be published by Time Warner Interactive, with Mirage serving as the developer. &quot;Rise of the Robots&quot; was propelled by a multimillion-pound marketing campaign, which led to a novel from Penguin Books, and discussions were held regarding toys, comics, an animated series, and a feature film. In addition to the Amiga and PC DOS computer versions, &quot;Rise of the Robots&quot; was ported to various video game consoles, including the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Mega Drive, Game Gear, 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, Amiga CD32, and Philips CD-i.

The Mega Drive, Game Gear, and SNES versions were developed and programmed by Data Design Interactive. Absolute Entertainment initially owned the rights to the 3DO, Mega Drive, Game Gear, and SNES versions of the game but later sold all &quot;Rise of the Robots&quot; rights back to developer Mirage, except for the 3DO version rights. Mirage then sold the SNES rights to Acclaim Entertainment. In a reversal of the usual pattern for video games, the home versions were all developed and released first, with the enhanced arcade version coming later. Coombs stated that &quot;Rise of the Robots&quot; was originally developed with the Amiga in mind, while the PC version was a &quot;conversion &#x27;upwards,&#x27; meaning additions could be made.&quot; She added that problems arose with the console versions, and porting the game from one platform to another was not straightforward.

&quot;Rise of the Robots&quot; was originally scheduled for release in February 1994, but was delayed because the developers wanted to &quot;continue to perfect the graphics and enhance the gameplay as much as possible.&quot; &quot;Rise of the Robots&quot; was ultimately released on November 18, 1994, for Amiga and PC platforms. The SNES version was released in December, in North America by Acclaim Entertainment, and in Japan by T&amp;E Soft. The Mega Drive version was scheduled for a December 1994 release in Europe, but it was delayed until February 1995. The arcade version was released in May 1995 in the United Kingdom; it represented the main effort by the slot machine manufacturer Bell-Fruit to create an arcade machine using PC architecture.

A &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; edition was released on PC. It includes a second disc featuring work-in-progress footage, interactive pre-production animations, still image galleries, and other behind-the-scenes material.

A version for the Atari Jaguar CD was in development by Art Data Interactive and was planned to be published by Time Warner Interactive in 1995, but it was never released for unknown reasons. Game Boy and Master System versions were also planned.

==Reception==
Reviewing the Amiga version for &quot;Amiga Power&quot;, Jonathan Davies noted that review copies had been released to the press only a few days before the game&#x27;s launch. He concluded that &quot;it&#x27;s probably because the graphics are [so] good that the game plays so poorly—every move the robots make takes so many frames of animation, and so much memory, and so many months of rendering with 3D Studio, that it simply wouldn&#x27;t have been possible to make the gameplay any more complicated than it is.&quot; Davies highlighted several flaws, including the inability for players to turn around, the limited sound effects and music, the fact that most computer opponents could be defeated by repeatedly using a simple flying kick, and the static background graphics. Andy Nuttall of &quot;The One Amiga&quot; echoed these sentiments, stating that &quot;xcept on &#x27;Hard&#x27; level, all but the Supervisor and one other opponent can be slaughtered by trapping them in the corner and inflicting repeated jump kicks.&quot; Nuttall criticized the game for its short length and added that &quot;there aren&#x27;t enough characters.&quot;

A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; remarked, &quot;Although the glossy rendered images make the seven different warriors look truly remarkable, the actual playability of the game suffers from the same lack of control plaguing most PC fighting games.&quot; He further criticized the poorly designed opponent AI and labeled the game &quot;one of the biggest disappointments of the year.&quot;

&quot;GamePro&quot; panned the Game Gear version, summarizing that &quot;the bad control, weak gameplay, and choppy animation infest this cart from start to finish.&quot; They particularly criticized the moves as boringly basic and limited, noting that the choppy animation makes the player feel disconnected from what is happening on screen. Reviewing the SNES version, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; stated that the graphics are excellent, but the poor control and limited number of moves cripple the game. &quot;GamePro&quot; labeled it &quot;one of the most unappealing fighting games ever made for the SNES,&quot; citing the dark and bland color scheme and the &quot;extremely weak and choppy&quot; controls.

&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; was even more condemnatory of the 3DO version, with one reviewer calling it &quot;by far the worst fighting game I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; All four of their reviewers criticized it for having overlong cinemas, a severely limited number of moves, difficulty executing even basic punches and kicks, and long load times. &quot;GamePro&quot; also panned the 3DO version, commenting that &quot;Rise offers deceptively good graphics—the rendered cinemas, characters, and backgrounds do their best to gloss over the choppy gameplay animation and lack of moves.&quot;

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the SNES version of the game, stating, &quot;In the end, &quot;Robots&quot; is just another forgettable &#x27;me-too&#x27; brawler.&quot;

According to Mirage, the Amiga CD32 version of &quot;Rise of the Robots&quot; sold to more than 45% of the Amiga CD32&#x27;s installed base.

Power Unlimited gave the CD-i version a score of 30% summarizing: &quot;Rise of the Robots may have been somewhat playable on the PC and Super Nintendo, but that is not at all the case on the CD-i. There it is mainly heavy, very heavy (but beautifully designed) s***. How slow and actionless it is!

===Retrospective=== 
&quot;Next Generation&quot;″s 1998 retrospective on the failure of &quot;Rise of the Robots&quot; commented, &quot;Most gamers now know not to trust packaging graphics, but this was a lesson that had to be learned the hard way. In hindsight, it&#x27;s obvious that nothing could look that good (and &quot;Rise of the Robots&quot; certainly looked really good) and simultaneously offer great gameplay ... But back in 1994, no one was aware that such high-resolution &#x27;rendered graphics&#x27; came with such a price tag, and no one was expecting the game to fail.&quot;

In 2014, GamesRadar staff named &quot;Rise of the Robots&quot; the 100th worst video game ever made. They discussed the propensity for bad 2D fighting games in the 1990s and criticized its &quot;aged&quot; rendered 3D graphics, poor character balance, poor combo system, and difficulty spikes. Kevin Green of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; listed &quot;Rise of the Robots&quot; as one of the &quot;games we hope to never see on the Virtual Console service.&quot; Green criticized the game for its monotonous gameplay, non-existent game balance, and limited controls, stating it &quot;was a horrible mess from start to finish, clearly rushed out to make money from the beat-em-up craze.&quot; Reviewing the SNES version, Brett Alan Weiss of AllGame cited the game as &quot;one of the most boring 16-bit fighting games,&quot; although he praised the game&#x27;s soundtrack as &quot;riveting and distinctive.&quot;

Mirage&#x27;s managing director Peter Jones has stated that he stands by the game&#x27;s quality, arguing that the negative response to &quot;Rise of the Robots&quot; was primarily due to the out-of-control hype that built expectations no game could fulfill. He claimed that while the console versions were panned, reviews for the PC versions &quot;were very positive.&quot;

==Sequel and legacy==
Despite its critical and commercial failure, Mirage released &quot;Rise 2: Resurrection&quot; in 1996 as a more conventional fighting game with extended features. The story further expanded upon that of the original game. Originally developed for computer systems, it was also ported to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, again with little success.

&quot;Rise 2&quot; features an original song by Brian May entitled &quot;Cyborg.&quot; The PC CD-ROM version of the game included two audio CD format versions of the track, along with other music from the game. The European-released Director&#x27;s Cut edition featured a second CD containing two additional versions of the song, as well as computer-altered sound files of May saying various words and phrases from the game. A newer version of &quot;Cyborg&quot; later appeared on May&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Another World&quot;.

Jim Murdoch penned a novelization of &quot;Rise of the Robots,&quot; which was published on February 2, 1995. It was based on the &quot;Rise of the Robots&quot; characters created by Sean Griffiths and Kwan Lee.

Deck13 Interactive stated that this game and the &quot;Dark Souls&quot; series inspired &quot;The Surge&quot;.

<doc id="224672" wikidata="Q230733" url="?curid=224672" title="Dianne Feinstein">
<text>Dianne Emiel Feinstein (; June 22, 1933 – September 29, 2023) was an American politician who served as a United States senator from California from 1992 until her death in 2023. A member of the Democratic Party, she served as mayor of San Francisco from 1978 to 1988.

A San Francisco native, Feinstein graduated from Stanford University in 1955. She was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1969 and immediately became the board&#x27;s first female president upon her appointment in 1970. In 1978, during a third stint as the board&#x27;s president, the assassinations of Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk drew national attention. Feinstein succeeded Moscone as mayor and became the first woman to serve in that position. During her tenure, she led the renovation of the city&#x27;s cable car system and oversaw the 1984 Democratic National Convention. Despite a recall attempt in 1983, Feinstein was a popular mayor and was named the most effective mayor in the country by &quot;City &amp; State&quot; in 1987.

After losing a race for governor in 1990, Feinstein was elected to the U.S. Senate in a 1992 special election. In November 1992, she became California&#x27;s first female U.S. senator; shortly afterward, she became the state&#x27;s senior senator when Alan Cranston retired in January 1993. Feinstein was reelected five times. In the 2012 election, she received 7.86 million votes, which was, until 2024, the most popular votes received by any U.S. Senate candidate in history.

As a senator, Feinstein authored the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban, was the first woman to chair the Senate Rules Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee, and was the first woman to preside over a U.S. presidential inauguration. She chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee from 2009 to 2015 and was the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 2017 to 2021.

Feinstein&#x27;s last years in office were marred by poor health and concerns about her mental acuity to serve. In February 2023, Feinstein announced she would not seek reelection in 2024. Seven months later, she died in office at the age of 90. By the time of her death, Feinstein was the oldest sitting U.S. senator and member of Congress. She was also the longest-serving U.S. senator from California and the longest-tenured female senator in history.
== Early life and education ==
Feinstein was born Dianne Emiel Goldman on June 22, 1933, in San Francisco to Leon Goldman, a prominent surgeon, and his wife, Betty (née Rosenburg), a former model. Her paternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Poland. Her maternal grandparents, the Rosenburgs, were from Saint Petersburg, Russia. Although they were of German-Jewish ancestry, they practiced the Russian Orthodox (Christian) faith, as was required of Jews in Saint Petersburg. Christianity was passed down to Feinstein&#x27;s mother, who insisted on her transfer from a Jewish day school to a prestigious local Catholic school, but Feinstein listed her religion as Judaism.

She graduated from Convent of the Sacred Heart High School in 1951 and from Stanford University in 1955 with a Bachelor of Arts in history. According to multiple sources, Feinstein&#x27;s mother was abusive. Feinstein&#x27;s sister, Yvonne Banks, said their mother had unpredictable moods. Later, Feinstein&#x27;s mother received a brain scan that found that the part of her brain responsible for judgment had atrophied, &quot;possibly because of complications from a severe illness as a child&quot;.

== Early political career ==

From 1955 to 1956, Feinstein was a fellow at the Coro Foundation in San Francisco, an organization that provides young people with political experience. Governor Pat Brown appointed her to the California Women&#x27;s Parole Board in 1960. She served on the board until 1966.

=== San Francisco Board of Supervisors and assassination attempt ===
Feinstein was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1969. She remained on the board for nine years, serving as its first female president from 1970 to 1971, with additional tenures from 1974 to 1975 and January to December 1978.

During her tenure on the Board of Supervisors, she unsuccessfully ran for mayor of San Francisco twice, in 1971 against Mayor Joseph Alioto, and in 1975, when she lost the contest for a runoff slot (against George Moscone) to Supervisor John Barbagelata.

Because of her position, Feinstein became a target of the New World Liberation Front, an anti-capitalist terrorist group that carried out bombings in California in the 1970s. In 1976, the NWLF placed a bomb on the windowsill of her home that failed to explode. The group later shot out the windows of a beach house she owned.

=== Mayor of San Francisco ===
After San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk were assassinated by former Supervisor Dan White on November 27, 1978, Feinstein became acting mayor, as she was president of the Board of Supervisors. Supervisors John Molinari, Ella Hill Hutch, Ron Pelosi, Robert Gonzales, and Gordon Lau endorsed her for an appointment as mayor by the Board of Supervisors. Gonzales initially ran to be appointed by the Board of Supervisors as mayor, but dropped out. The Board of Supervisors voted six to two to appoint Feinstein as mayor. She was inaugurated by Chief Justice Rose Bird of the Supreme Court of California on December 4, 1978, becoming San Francisco&#x27;s first female mayor. Molinari was selected to replace Feinstein as president of the Board of Supervisors by a vote of eight to two.

One of Feinstein&#x27;s first challenges as mayor was the state of the San Francisco cable car system, which was shut down for emergency repairs in 1979; an engineering study concluded that it needed comprehensive rebuilding at a cost of $60 million. Feinstein helped win federal funding for the bulk of the work. The system closed for rebuilding in 1982 and was completed in time for the 1984 Democratic National Convention. Feinstein also oversaw policies to increase the number of San Francisco&#x27;s high-rise buildings.

Feinstein was seen as a relatively moderate Democrat in one of the country&#x27;s most liberal cities. As a supervisor, she was considered part of the centrist bloc that included White and generally opposed Moscone. As mayor, Feinstein angered the city&#x27;s large gay community in 1982 by vetoing legislation which would have extended city-employee benefits to domestic partners. In the 1980 presidential election, while a majority of Bay Area Democrats continued to support Senator Ted Kennedy&#x27;s primary challenge to President Jimmy Carter even after it was clear Kennedy could not win, Feinstein strongly supported the Carter–Mondale ticket. She was given a high-profile speaking role on the opening night of the August Democratic National Convention, urging delegates to reject the Kennedy delegates&#x27; proposal to &quot;open&quot; the convention, thereby allowing delegates to ignore their states&#x27; popular vote, a proposal that was soundly defeated.

In the run-up to the 1984 Democratic National Convention, there was considerable media and public speculation that Mondale might pick Feinstein as his running mate. He chose Geraldine Ferraro instead. In 1982, Feinstein proposed banning handguns in San Francisco, and became subject to a recall attempt organized by the White Panther Party. She won the recall election and finished her second term as mayor on January 8, 1988.

Feinstein revealed sensitive details about the hunt for serial killer Richard Ramirez at a 1985 press conference, antagonizing detectives by publicizing details of his crimes known only to law enforcement, and thus jeopardizing their investigation.

&quot;City &amp; State&quot; magazine named Feinstein the nation&#x27;s &quot;Most Effective Mayor&quot; in 1987. She was a member of the Trilateral Commission in 1988.

=== Gubernatorial election ===
Feinstein made an unsuccessful bid for governor of California in 1990. She won the Democratic nomination, but lost the general election to U.S. Senator Pete Wilson, who resigned from the Senate to assume the governorship. In 1992, Feinstein was fined $190,000 for failure to properly report campaign contributions and expenditures in that campaign.

== U.S. Senate ==
=== Elections ===

In 1991, Wilson resigned from the Senate to take office as governor of California. Feinstein ran for U.S. Senate in a 1992 special election to complete Wilson&#x27;s term. In the Democratic primary, she defeated Joseph Alioto and California State Controller Gray Davis. In November, she faced Republican John Seymour, whom Wilson had appointed to the Senate the previous year. Feinstein won the November 3 special election, 54.3%–38%.

Like Feinstein, Barbara Boxer was first elected to the Senate on November 3, 1992. Because Feinstein was elected to complete an unexpired term, she was sworn in as a senator in November 1992, while Boxer did not take office until January 1993; therefore, Feinstein became California&#x27;s senior senator. She also became the first female Jewish U.S. senator. Feinstein and Boxer were the first female pair of U.S. senators to represent any state at the same time.

Feinstein was reelected in 1994, 2000, 2006, 2012, and 2018.

In October 2017, Feinstein declared her intention to run for reelection in 2018. She lost the endorsement of the California Democratic Party&#x27;s executive board, which opted to support State Senator Kevin de León. Nevertheless, Feinstein finished first in the state&#x27;s &quot;jungle primary&quot; and was reelected in the November 6 general election, defeating de Leon, 54.2–45.8%.

=== Tenure ===
Feinstein has been described as &quot;a titan of US political history who notched countless legislative achievements&quot; in her Senate career. She was known for her work on gun control issues. In 1994, she spearheaded the passage of a federal assault weapons ban. In the 2000s and 2010s, she investigated &quot;the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s program of detention and interrogation after the Sept. 11 attacks&quot;.

In 2009, Feinstein chaired the first inaugural ceremony of President Barack Obama. She was the first woman to chair the Senate Rules Committee (2007–2009) and the first to chair the Select Committee on Intelligence (2009–2015). Feinstein became the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017, and was the first woman to hold that position. On March 28, 2021, she became the longest-serving U.S. senator from California ever, surpassing Hiram Johnson. On November 5, 2022, Feinstein became the longest-serving female senator in U.S. history.

In the fall of 2020, media reports indicated that Feinstein was experiencing cognitive decline and short-term memory loss. She responded that there was no cause for concern and that she had no plans to leave the Senate. After her performance at Amy Coney Barrett&#x27;s October 2020 Supreme Court nomination hearings was criticized, Feinstein did not seek to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee or serve as its ranking member in 2021. Articles in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; cited unnamed Democratic senators and aides expressing concern over her age and ability to lead the committee. In mid-2022, NPR and other outlets ran stories questioning Feinstein&#x27;s cognition. On October 22, 2022, Feinstein said that due to family matters, she was not interested in serving as president pro tempore in 2023; the position is traditionally held by the senior member of the Senate&#x27;s majority party.

In February 2023, Feinstein said she would not seek reelection in 2024 and that she intended to retire upon the completion of her term.

Feinstein&#x27;s two-month hospitalization for shingles in early 2023 effectively stalled many of the Biden administration&#x27;s judicial and executive nominees. Feinstein served on the Judiciary Committee, which was evenly split between Democrats and Republicans without her. Representatives Ro Khanna, Dean Phillips, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, along with a group of California progressive organizations and the &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial board, publicly urged Feinstein to resign. She resisted calls to resign. However, she requested temporary removal from the Judiciary Committee; Senate Republicans declined this request.

Feinstein returned to the Senate on May 10, 2023, amid continuing concern about her capacity to serve.

=== Committee assignments ===
Feinstein was the first woman to chair the Senate Rules Committee (2007–2009) and the first to chair the Select Committee on Intelligence (2009–2015). She became the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017, and was the first woman to hold that position. Her committee assignments for the 118th Congress were as follows:
* Committee on Appropriations
** Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies
** Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies
** Subcommittee on Defense
** Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development (Chair)
** Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies
** Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies
* Committee on the Judiciary
** Subcommittee on the Constitution (Chair)
** Subcommittee on Criminal Justice and Counterterrorism
** Subcommittee on Federal Courts, Oversight, Agency Action and Federal Rights
** Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law
* Committee on Rules and Administration
* Select Committee on Intelligence
She previously sat on the Foreign Relations Committee (104th Congress) and Energy and Natural Resources Committee (107th–109th Congress)

=== Caucus memberships ===
* Afterschool Caucuses
* Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus
* Senate New Democrat Coalition (defunct)

== Political positions ==
In 2018, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that Feinstein had emphasized her centrism when she first ran for statewide offices in the 1990s (when California was more conservative than it became during Feinstein&#x27;s later career). Over time, she moved leftward as California became one of the most Democratic states in the nation. In 2013, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called her a &quot;liberal lioness&quot;. Feinstein was known for her advocacy of gun control, abortion access, environmental protection, and a strong national defense.

=== Abortion ===
Feinstein supported abortion rights during her Senate career. In 2003, she voted against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, a proposal to ban intact dilation and extraction, although the proposal eventually became law. After the Supreme Court overturned &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; in 2022, Feinstein called for congressional action to protect abortion rights and stated her support for lifting the Senate filibuster rule to allow such legislation to pass with a simple majority.

=== Capital punishment ===
When Feinstein first ran for statewide office in 1990, she supported capital punishment. In 2004, she called for the death penalty in the case of San Francisco police officer Isaac Espinoza, who was killed while on duty. By 2018, she opposed capital punishment.

=== Energy and environment ===

====Climate change mitigation====

In 2007, Feinstein led a bipartisan effort as part of the wider Energy Independence and Security Act to significantly reduce automotive greenhouse gas emissions, which accounted for 26 percent of total U.S. emissions at the time. Her legislation, the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act, raised corporate average fuel economy standards for America&#x27;s fleet of vehicles by at least 10 miles per gallon between 2010 and 2020 - the largest increase in fuel efficiency in almost three decades. Thereafter, said CAFE standards became subject to periodic adjustments by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration under the Administrative Procedure Act. As a result of Feinstein&#x27;s legislation, average fleet fuel economy for new automobiles will climb to approximately 60 miles per gallon by 2032, cutting greenhouse gas emissions from passenger and commercial vehicles in half without impeding automotive performance or degrading traffic safety.

During the 110th Congress, Feinstein authored an amendment to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, mandating all major sources of greenhouse gasses to annually report their emissions to the Environmental Protection Agency. These emissions disclosures in turn inform EPA&#x27;s nationwide, multi-sector inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and sinks, which is submitted to the United Nations in accordance with the Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Feinstein co-sponsored (with Oklahoma Republican Tom Coburn) an amendment through the Senate to the Economic Development Revitalization Act of 2011 that eliminated the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit. The Senate passed the amendment on June 16, 2011. Introduced in 2004, the subsidy provided a 45-cent-per-gallon credit on pure ethanol, and a 54-cent-per-gallon tariff on imported ethanol. These subsidies had resulted in an annual expenditure of $6 billion.

In February 2019, when youth associated with the Sunrise Movement confronted Feinstein about why she did not support the Green New Deal, she told them, &quot;there&#x27;s no way to pay for it&quot;, and that it could not pass a Republican-controlled Senate. In a tweet after the confrontation, she said that she remained committed &quot;to enact real, meaningful climate change legislation&quot;. Conversely, the Sunrise Movement tweeted that Feinstein had reacted with &quot;smugness and disrespect&quot;, and that &quot;her reaction is why young people desperately want new leadership in Congress.&quot;

Later in the 116th and 117th Congresses, Feinstein authored the Addressing Climate Financial Risk Act, to prepare U.S. financial institutions for risks posed by climate change. While Feinstein&#x27;s bill ultimately died in the Senate, President Biden issued an executive order containing several of its provisions, including directing the Treasury Department to study climate-related financial risks. In addition, Feinstein co-sponsored with Senator Coons the Climate Action Rebate Act of 2019 - legislation that would create a nationwide carbon fee and dividend program to decarbonize the American economy and transition it to net-zero. As with the Addressing Climate Financial Risk Act, the Climate Action Rebate Act also failed to make it out of committee. However, a separate battery storage tax credit bill co-sponsored by Feinstein was ultimately incorporated into the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation she also supported.

====Lake Tahoe====
Feinstein, who spent her childhood visiting the lake, regarded Lake Tahoe as &quot;a national treasure&quot; and &quot;the Jewel of the High Sierra&quot;. She founded the Lake Tahoe Summit in 1997 and successfully authored the landmark Lake Tahoe Restoration Act of 2000. This act of Congress formally created the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit within the National Forest System and authorized $900 million in federal spending over ten years for invasive species control, stormwater management, environmental protection, and fire risk mitigation projects throughout the Lake Tahoe watershed. Later in 2016, Feinstein co-sponsored with senators Barbara Boxer, Harry Reid, and Dean Heller a bipartisan seven-year extension of the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act, authorizing another $415 million to combat invasive species, improve water quality and forest health, restore habitat for fish and wildlife, and reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfires. She co-sponsored a second bipartisan, bicameral reauthorization of the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act&#x27;s activities with senators Catherine Cortez Masto, Jacky Rosen, and Alex Padilla on March 1, 2023 – six months before her death.

====Public lands====
Feinstein co-sponsored legislation in 2006 with Barbara Boxer that permanently protected approximately 300,000 acres of wilderness in Northern California, namely the King Range, Yolla-Bolly Middle Eel, and Trinity Alps wilderness areas, along with 21 miles of the Black Butte River in Mendocino County. The King Range Wilderness, part of the King Range National Conservation Area, has the longest stretch of undeveloped coastline anywhere in the lower 48 states; its Lost Coast is often considered the &quot;crown jewel&quot; in the National Landscape Conservation System. The Yolla-Bolly Middle Eel Wilderness, which surrounds the Middle Fork Eel River, hosts roughly half of California&#x27;s summer-run steelhead population. The river is the largest remaining wild run of these fish in the lower 48 states. The Trinity Alps Wilderness encompasses rugged mountains, alpine meadows, myriad pristine lakes and streams, 550 miles of maintained hiking trails, and California&#x27;s third-largest swath of previously unprotected old-growth, predominantly Douglas-fir forest.

Feinstein also helped secure $250 million in federal matching grants to purchase the 7,500-acre Headwaters Forest, the world&#x27;s last unprotected, intact, old-growth redwood forest. Her 1999 legislation also guaranteed the continued conservation of 12 ancient redwood groves by bringing them under federal management. Several threatened species call the Headwaters Forest home, including coho salmon, the northern spotted owl, and the marbled murrelet. The resulting Headwaters Forest Reserve is managed by the Bureau of Land Management in partnership with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife as part of the National Landscape Conservation System.

Perhaps Feinstein&#x27;s greatest contribution to public lands conservation came through her advocacy for California&#x27;s Mojave and Sonoran deserts. She authored landmark legislation in 1994 that established Death Valley National Park, Joshua Tree National Park, and Mojave National Preserve, and designated another 7.6 million acres of California desert as federal wilderness. This California Desert Protection Act was followed in 2000 by Feinstein&#x27;s Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument Act, designating 272,000 acres in the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto mountain ranges as a national monument. Later in 2016, Feinstein requested President Obama create Mojave Trails, Sand to Snow, and Castle Mountains national monuments under the Antiquities Act. She also authored the California Desert Protection and Recreation Act as part of the bipartisan omnibus public lands package passed in 2019, furthering landscape conservation and outdoor recreation opportunities in the California desert. The combined acreage of the 1994, 2000, and 2019 acts of Congress, in concert with the presidentially authorized national monument designations, protect the largest tract of public lands anywhere in the lower 48 states and the second-largest desert preserve on the planet.

=== Foreign policy ===
==== China ====
Feinstein supported a conciliatory approach between China and Taiwan and fostered increased dialogue between high-level Chinese representatives and U.S. senators during her first term as senator. When asked about her relation with Beijing, Feinstein said, &quot;I sometimes say that in my last life maybe I was Chinese.&quot;

Feinstein criticized Beijing&#x27;s missile tests near Taiwan and called for dismantlement of missiles pointed at the island. She promoted stronger business ties between China and Taiwan over confrontation, and suggested that the U.S. patiently &quot;use two-way trade across Taiwan Strait as a platform for more political dialogue and closer ties&quot;.

She believed that deeper cross-strait economic integration &quot;will one day lead to political integration and will ultimately provide the solution&quot; to the Taiwan issue.

On July 27, 2018, reports surfaced that a Chinese staff member who worked for 20 years as Feinstein&#x27;s personal driver, gofer and liaison to the Asian-American community was caught reporting to China&#x27;s Ministry of State Security. According to the reports, the FBI had contacted Feinstein five years earlier warning her about the employee. The employee was later interviewed by authorities and forced to retire by Feinstein. No criminal charges were filed against him.

==== Iran ====
Feinstein supported the Iran nuclear deal framework in July 2015, saying that it would usher in &quot;unprecedented &amp; intrusive inspections to verify cooperation&quot; by Iran.

On June 7, 2017, Feinstein and Senator Bernie Sanders issued dual statements urging the Senate to forgo a vote for sanctions on Iran in response to the Tehran attacks that occurred earlier in the day.

==== Iraq ====

Feinstein voted for the Iraq War and later said she regretted it.

==== Israel ====
In September 2016—in advance of UN Security Council resolution 2334 condemning Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories—Feinstein signed an AIPAC-sponsored letter urging Obama to veto &quot;one-sided&quot; resolutions against Israel.

Feinstein opposed President Donald Trump&#x27;s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital, saying, &quot;Recognizing Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital—or relocating our embassy to Jerusalem—will spark violence and embolden extremists on both sides of the debate.&quot;

==== North Korea ====
During a July 2017 appearance on &quot;Face the Nation&quot; after North Korea conducted a second test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, Feinstein said the country had proven itself a danger to the U.S. She also expressed her disappointment with China&#x27;s lack of response.

Responding to reports that North Korea had achieved successful miniaturization of nuclear warheads, Feinstein issued an August 8, 2017, statement insisting that isolation of North Korea had proven ineffective and that Trump&#x27;s rhetoric was not helping resolve potential conflict. She also called for the U.S. to &quot;quickly engage North Korea in a high-level dialogue without any preconditions&quot;.

In September 2017, after Trump&#x27;s first speech to the United Nations General Assembly, in which he threatened North Korea, Feinstein released a statement disagreeing with his remarks: &quot;Trump&#x27;s bombastic threat to destroy North Korea and his refusal to present any positive pathways forward on the many global challenges we face are severe disappointments.&quot;

=== Gun control ===

Feinstein introduced the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which became law in 1994 and expired in 2004. In January 2013, about a month after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, she and Representative Carolyn McCarthy proposed a bill that would &quot;ban the sale, transfer, manufacturing or importation of 150 specific firearms including semiautomatic rifles or pistols that can be used with a detachable or fixed ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds and have specific military-style features, including pistol grips, grenade launchers or rocket launchers&quot;. The bill would have exempted 900 models of guns used for sport and hunting. Feinstein said of the bill, &quot;The common thread in each of these shootings is the gunman used a semi-automatic assault weapon or large-capacity ammunition magazines. Military assault weapons only have one purpose, and in my opinion, it&#x27;s for the military.&quot; The bill failed on a Senate vote of 60 to 40.

=== Health care ===
Feinstein supported the Affordable Care Act, repeatedly voting to defeat initiatives aimed against it. She voted to regulate tobacco as a drug; expand the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program; override the president&#x27;s veto of adding 2 to 4 million children to SCHIP eligibility; increase Medicaid rebate for producing generic drugs; negotiate bulk purchases for Medicare prescription drugs; allow re-importation of prescription drugs from Canada; allow patients to sue HMOs and collect punitive damages; cover prescription drugs under Medicare, and means-test Medicare. She voted against the Paul Ryan Budget&#x27;s Medicare choice, tax and spending cuts; and allowing tribal Indians to opt out of federal healthcare. Feinstein also favored the creation of a public option to achieve universal healthcare, co-sponsoring a bill with that aim. Feinstein&#x27;s congressional voting record was rated as 88% by the American Public Health Association (APHA), the figure ostensibly reflecting the percentage of time the representative voted the organization&#x27;s preferred position.

At an April 2017 town hall meeting in San Francisco, Feinstein was booed when she stated that she did not support a proposal for single-payer health insurance. Feinstein said, &quot;[i]f single-payer health care is going to mean the complete takeover by the government of all health care, I am not there.&quot; During a news conference at the University of California, San Diego in July 2017, she estimated that Democratic opposition would prove sufficient to defeat Republican attempts to repeal the ACA. Feinstein wrote in an August 2017 op-ed that Trump could secure health-care reform if he compromised with Democrats: &quot;We now know that such a closed process on a major issue like health care doesn&#x27;t work. The only path forward is a transparent process that allows every senator to bring their ideas to the table.&quot;

=== Immigration ===
In September 2017, after Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Feinstein admitted the legality of the program was questionable while citing this as a reason for why a law should be passed. In her opening remarks at a January 2018 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, she said she was concerned the Trump administration&#x27;s decision to terminate temporary protected status might be racially motivated, based on comments Trump made denigrating African countries, Haiti, and El Salvador.

=== LGBTQ+ rights ===
In 1996, Feinstein was one of only 14 senators to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage as an opposite-sex union for purposes of federal law. In 2011, she introduced a bill to repeal DOMA. In 2022, she was the lead Senate sponsor of the Respect for Marriage Act, which repealed DOMA and required the federal government and all state governments to recognize same-sex and interracial marriages.

=== Marijuana ===
Feinstein opposed a number of reforms to cannabis laws at the state and federal level. In 2016 she opposed Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act, to legalize recreational cannabis in California. In 1996 she opposed Proposition 215 to legalize the medical use of cannabis in California. In 2015 she was the only Democrat at a Senate hearing to vote against the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment, legislation that limits the enforcement of federal law in states that have legalized medical cannabis. Feinstein cited her belief that cannabis is a gateway drug in voting against the amendment.

In 2018, Feinstein softened her views on marijuana and cosponsored the STATES Act, legislation that would protect states from federal interference regarding both medical and recreational use. She also supported legislation in 2015 to allow medical cannabis to be recommended to veterans in states where its use is legal.

=== National security ===
====Defense policy====
While delivering the commencement address at Stanford Stadium on June 13, 1994, Feinstein said:

Feinstein was described during her lifetime as a &quot;hawk&quot; on matters of national security. She voted for the extension of the Patriot Act and the FISA provisions in 2012. Feinstein also voted for President Trump&#x27;s $675-billion defense budget bill for FY 2019. Later in 2017, she criticized the banning of transgender enlistments in the military under the Trump administration.

==== Mass surveillance and citizens&#x27; privacy ====
Feinstein co-sponsored PIPA on May 12, 2011. She met with representatives of technology companies, including Google and Facebook, in January 2012. A Feinstein spokesperson said she &quot;is doing all she can to ensure that the bill is balanced and protects the intellectual property concerns of the content community without unfairly burdening legitimate businesses such as Internet search engines&quot;.

Following her 2012 vote to extend the Patriot Act and the FISA provisions, and after the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures involving the National Security Agency (NSA), Feinstein promoted and supported measures to continue the information collection programs. Feinstein and Saxby Chambliss also defended the NSA&#x27;s request to Verizon for all the metadata about phone calls made within the U.S. and from the U.S. to other countries. They said the information gathered by intelligence on the phone communications is used to connect phone lines to terrorists and that it did not contain the content of the phone calls or messages. &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; wrote that she had a &quot;reputation as a staunch defender of NSA practices and [of] the White House&#x27;s refusal to stand by collection activities targeting foreign leaders&quot;.

In October 2013, Feinstein criticized the NSA for monitoring telephone calls of foreign leaders friendly to the U.S. In November 2013, she promoted the FISA Improvements Act bill, which included a &quot;backdoor search provision&quot; that allows intelligence agencies to continue certain warrantless searches as long as they are logged and &quot;available for review&quot; to various agencies.

In June 2013, Feinstein called Edward Snowden a &quot;traitor&quot; after his leaks went public. In October 2013, she said she stood by that.

In 2014, Feinstein accused the CIA of snooping and removing files from congressional computers, saying that the &quot;CIA&#x27;s search may well have violated the separation of powers principles embodied in the United States Constitution&quot;. Several months later the CIA admitted to having hacked Senate Intelligence Committee computers. Feinstein&#x27;s displeasure at having been spied on was contrasted with her support for government surveillance of US citizens, with public figures and privacy advocates such as Jon Stewart and Edward Snowden noting the apparent incongruity.

After the 2016 FBI–Apple encryption dispute, Feinstein and Richard Burr sponsored a bill that would likely have criminalized all forms of strong encryption in electronic communication between citizens. The bill would have required technology companies to design their encryption so that they can provide law enforcement with user data in an &quot;intelligible format&quot; when required to do so by court order.

In 2020, Feinstein co sponsored the EARN IT Act, which seeks to create a 19-member committee to decide a list of best practices websites must follow to be protected by section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The EARN IT Act effectively outlaws end-to-end encryption, depriving the world of secure, private communications tools.

==== Torture ====
Feinstein served on the Senate&#x27;s Select Committee on Intelligence, her time on the committee coinciding with the Senate Report on Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq and the debates on the torture/&quot;enhanced interrogation&quot; of terrorists and alleged terrorists. On the Senate floor on December 9, 2014, the day parts of the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture were released to the public, Feinstein called the government&#x27;s detention and interrogation program a &quot;stain on our values and on our history&quot;.

=== Presidential politics ===
During the 1980 presidential election, Feinstein served on President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s steering committee in California and as a Carter delegate to the Democratic National Convention. She was selected to serve as one of the four chairs of the 1980 Democratic National Convention.

Feinstein endorsed former Vice President Walter Mondale during the 1984 presidential election. She and Democratic National Committee chairman Charles Manatt signed a contract in 1983, making San Francisco the host of the 1984 Democratic National Convention.

As a superdelegate in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, Feinstein said she would support Clinton for the nomination. But after Barack Obama became the presumptive nominee, she fully backed his candidacy. Days after Obama amassed enough delegates to win the nomination, Feinstein lent her Washington, D.C., home to Clinton and Obama for a private one-on-one meeting. She did not attend the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver because she had fallen and broken her ankle earlier in the month.

Feinstein chaired the United States Congress Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and acted as mistress of ceremonies, introducing each participant at the 2009 presidential inauguration. She was the first woman to have presided over a U.S. presidential inauguration.

Ahead of the 2016 presidential election, Feinstein was one of 16 female Democratic senators to sign an October 20, 2013, letter endorsing Hillary Clinton for president.

At an August 29, 2017, event in San Francisco, Feinstein expressed hope that Trump could become a good president. &quot;The question is whether he can learn and change&quot;, she said. &quot;If so, I believe he can be a good president&quot;. The next day, Feinstein released a clarifying statement: &quot;I&#x27;ve been strongly critical of President Trump when I disagree on policy and with his behavior... While I&#x27;m under no illusion that it&#x27;s likely to happen and will continue to oppose his policies, I want President Trump to change for the good of the country&quot;.

On January 9, 2018, Feinstein caused a stir when, as ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, she released a transcript of its August 2017 interview with Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson about the dossier regarding connections between Trump&#x27;s campaign and the Russian government. She did this unilaterally after the committee&#x27;s chairman, Chuck Grassley, refused to release the transcript.

As the 2020 presidential election approached, Feinstein indicated her support for former Vice President Joe Biden. This came as a surprise to many pundits, due to the potential candidacy of fellow U.S. Senator from California Kamala Harris, of whom Feinstein said &quot;I&#x27;m a big fan of Sen. Harris, and I work with her. But she&#x27;s brand-new here, so it takes a little bit of time to get to know somebody.&quot;

=== Supreme Court nominations ===

In September 2005, Feinstein was one of five Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee to vote against Supreme Court nominee John Roberts, saying that Roberts had &quot;failed to state his positions on such social controversies as abortion and the right to die&quot;.

In January 2006, Feinstein said she would vote against Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito, but expressed disapproval of a filibuster: &quot;When it comes to filibustering a Supreme Court appointment, you really have to have something out there, whether it&#x27;s gross moral turpitude or something that comes to the surface. This is a man I might disagree with, [but] that doesn&#x27;t mean he shouldn&#x27;t be on the court.&quot;

On July 12, 2009, Feinstein said the Senate would confirm Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor, praising her for her experience and for overcoming &quot;adversity and disadvantage&quot;.

After President Obama nominated Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in March 2016, Feinstein met with Garland on April 6 and later called on Republicans to do &quot;this institution the credit of sitting down and meeting with him&quot;.

In February 2017, Feinstein requested that Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch provide information on cases in which he had assisted with decision-making. In mid-March, she sent him a letter saying her request had not been met. Feinstein stated her opposition to Gorsuch&#x27;s nomination on April 3.

After Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court, Feinstein received a July 30, 2018, letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Ford accused Kavanaugh of having sexually assaulted her in the 1980s. Ford requested that her allegation be kept confidential. Feinstein did not refer the allegation to the FBI until September 14, 2018, after the Senate Judiciary Committee had completed its hearings on Kavanaugh&#x27;s nomination and &quot;after leaks to the media about [the Ford allegation] had reached a &#x27;fever pitch&#x27;&quot;. She faced &quot;sharp scrutiny&quot; for her decision to keep quiet about the Ford allegation for several weeks; she responded that she kept the letter and Ford&#x27;s identity confidential because Ford had requested it. Feinstein opposed Kavanaugh&#x27;s nomination. After an additional hearing and a supplemental FBI investigation, Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court on October 6, 2018.
In the fall of 2020, in her capacity as ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Feinstein participated in the confirmation hearings for President Trump&#x27;s nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. Shortly before the 2020 presidential election, Barrett was nominated to the Court following Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg&#x27;s death, and the nomination was intensely controversial. Feinstein opposed Barrett&#x27;s nomination, but at the conclusion of the hearings, she hugged Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, saying, &quot;this has been one of the best set of hearings that I&#x27;ve participated in&quot;. Outraged progressives responded by calling for Feinstein to step down from her leadership role on the committee. Barrett was confirmed to the Court. After the hearings, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he had had a &quot;long and serious&quot; talk with Feinstein. After the 2020 election, Feinstein announced that she would not seek to serve as chair or as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee in 2021.

== Awards and honors ==
Feinstein was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from Golden Gate University in San Francisco on June 4, 1977. She was awarded the Legion of Honour by France in 1984. Feinstein received with the Woodrow Wilson Award for public service from the Woodrow Wilson Center of the Smithsonian Institution on November 3, 2001, in Los Angeles. In 2002, Feinstein won the American Medical Association&#x27;s Nathan Davis Award for &quot;the Betterment of the Public Health&quot;. She was named as one of &quot;The Forward&quot; 50 in 2015.

It was announced on January 16, 2024, that the San Francisco International Airport&#x27;s International Terminal would be named in honor of Feinstein.

== Personal life ==

Feinstein was married three times. She married Jack Berman (), who was then working in the San Francisco District Attorney&#x27;s Office, in 1956. She and Berman divorced three years later. Their daughter, Katherine Feinstein Mariano (), was the presiding judge of the San Francisco Superior Court for 12 years, through 2012. In 1962, shortly after beginning her career in politics, Feinstein married her second husband, neurosurgeon Bertram Feinstein, who died of colon cancer in 1978. Feinstein was then married to investment banker Richard C. Blum from 1980 until his death from cancer in 2022.

In 2003, Feinstein was ranked the fifth-wealthiest senator, with an estimated net worth of $26 million. Her net worth increased to between $43 and $99 million by 2005. Her 347-page financial-disclosure statement, characterized by the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; as &quot;nearly the size of a phone book&quot;, claimed to draw clear lines between her assets and her husband&#x27;s, with many of her assets in blind trusts.

Feinstein took up pencil drawing as a hobby in the 1990s, primarily depicting scenes from nature and still lifes of flowers taken from her gardens. She later made prints from her original pieces for charity auctions and as gifts to Senate colleagues, ambassadors, and other dignitaries. Despite her works being seen as collector&#x27;s items, Feinstein considered herself merely &quot;a doodler&quot;.

=== Decline in health ===
Feinstein had an artificial cardiac pacemaker inserted at George Washington University Hospital in January 2017.

In 2020, investigative journalist Jane Mayer reported that it had been evident to some colleagues and staffers for several years that Feinstein was experiencing cognitive decline. Mayer reported that among various short-term memory issues, Feinstein could not remember Chuck Schumer&#x27;s repeated attempts to convince her to relinquish her leadership of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Stories of Feinstein&#x27;s cognitive issues continued to circulate in the press for the last few years of her life: in 2022, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that she struggled to remember her colleagues&#x27; names, meetings she had attended, and phone calls she had received. When asked about her, some colleagues and staffers argued that Feinstein was following in the footsteps of Strom Thurmond, who remained in office with mental infirmity until age 100.

In March 2023, Feinstein was diagnosed with shingles and hospitalized. She then suffered complications, including encephalitis (which caused swelling in her brain) and Ramsay Hunt syndrome (which caused paralysis on the left side of her face and problems with her balance and eyesight). These complications delayed her return to the Senate. Feinstein, then 89, returned to the Senate floor in early May 2023 after a 10-week absence. At the time, she used a wheelchair and was described as frail and noticeably thinner. Soon after her return, when asked about her absence, Feinstein told reporters: &quot;I&#x27;ve been here. I&#x27;ve been voting&quot;. This remark raised further questions about her memory.

On July 17, 2023, Feinstein ceded power of attorney to her daughter, Katherine. In August 2023, Feinstein was hospitalized after falling at her home in San Francisco. A spokesperson said it was &quot;a minor fall&quot; and Feinstein was subsequently cleared to return home.

=== Death and funeral ===

Feinstein died of natural causes at her home in Washington, D.C., on September 29, 2023, at the age of 90. Despite longstanding health problems that had caused her to miss Judiciary Committee meetings for several months, her death was sudden, with Feinstein having cast a vote on the Senate floor the previous day that was needed for Democrats&#x27; efforts to avert a government shutdown.

Feinstein received many tributes from politicians such as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer; Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell; President Joe Biden; Vice President Kamala Harris, who served with Feinstein during her time in the Senate; former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton; House Speaker Kevin McCarthy; former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; former Secretary of State, First Lady and Senate colleague Hillary Clinton; fellow Senators Alex Padilla, Bob Casey Jr., Marco Rubio, Bernie Sanders, Susan Collins, Kirsten Gillibrand, Patty Murray, Rick Scott, Josh Hawley, Lindsey Graham, and Chuck Grassley; Representatives Barbara Lee, Adam Schiff, and Katie Porter, who were running for the Democratic nomination for Feinstein&#x27;s Senate seat in the 2024 election; and California Governor Gavin Newsom. 
Feinstein&#x27;s death marked the first time a sitting senator had died since John McCain died in 2018 of brain cancer, and the first time in U.S. history that a female senator died in office.

Feinstein lay in state at San Francisco City Hall on October 4, 2023. A memorial service was held the next day on the front steps of the Hall, and the public was discouraged from attending. At the service, President Biden eulogized Feinstein as &quot;a great American hero&quot;. Vice President Harris added, &quot;You helped move the ball forward, and our nation salutes you&quot;. The service was punctuated by flyovers of the Blue Angels, coinciding with San Francisco&#x27;s Fleet Week. Feinstein was buried between the graves of her two husbands at Hills of Eternity Memorial Park in Colma, California.

On October 1, 2023, Governor Newsom appointed Laphonza Butler to fill Feinstein&#x27;s vacant Senate seat. He had previously promised to appoint a Black woman in the event of a Senate vacancy. Butler chose not to run for Feinstein&#x27;s Senate seat in the 2024 election.

== In mass media ==
The 2019 film &quot;The Report&quot;, about the Senate Intelligence Committee investigation into the CIA&#x27;s use of torture, extensively features Feinstein, portrayed by Annette Bening.

<text>Arthur Hugh Clough ( ; 1 January 181913 November 1861) was an English poet, an educationalist, and the devoted assistant to Florence Nightingale. He was the brother of suffragist Anne Clough and father of Blanche Athena Clough, who both became principals of Newnham College, Cambridge.

==Life==
Arthur Clough was born in Liverpool to James Butler Clough, a cotton merchant of Welsh descent, and Anne Perfect, from Pontefract in Yorkshire. James Butler Clough was a younger son of a landed gentry family that had been living at Plas Clough in Denbighshire since 1567. In 1822 the family moved to the United States, and Clough&#x27;s early childhood was spent mainly in Charleston, South Carolina. In 1828 Clough and his older brother Charles Butler Clough (later head of the Clough family of Llwyn Offa, Flintshire and Boughton House, Chester, a magistrate and Deputy Lieutenant) returned to England to attend school in Chester. Holidays were often spent at Beaumaris. In 1829 Clough began attending Rugby School, then under Thomas Arnold, whose belief in rigorous education and lifestyles he accepted. (See Muscular Christianity.) Cut off to a large degree from his family, he passed a somewhat solitary boyhood, devoted to the school and to early literary efforts in the &quot;Rugby Magazine&quot;. In 1836 his parents returned to Liverpool, and in 1837 he won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford. Here his contemporaries included Benjamin Jowett, Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, John Campbell Shairp, William George Ward and Frederick Temple. Matthew Arnold, four years his junior, arrived the term after Clough had graduated. Clough and Arnold enjoyed an intense friendship in Oxford.

Oxford, in 1837, was in the full swirl of the High Church movement led by John Henry Newman. Clough was for a time influenced by this movement, but eventually rejected it. He surprised everyone by graduating from Oxford with only Second Class Honours, but won a fellowship with a tutorship at Oriel College. He became unwilling to teach the doctrines of the Church of England, as his tutorship required of him, and in 1848 he resigned the position and travelled to Paris, where he witnessed the revolution of 1848. Ralph Waldo Emerson was also in Paris at that time, and Clough saw him daily in May and June, and months later after his return to England. As Edward Everett Hale tells the story:

:Clough accompanied [Emerson] to Liverpool to see him off on his return to the United States, saying sadly, &quot;What shall we do without you? Think where we are. Carlyle has led us all out into the desert and he has left us there&quot; a remark which was exactly true. Emerson said in reply that very many of the fine young men in England had said this to him as he went up and down in his journeyings there. &quot;And I put my hand upon his head as we walked, and I said, &#x27;Clough, I consecrate you Bishop of All England. It shall be your part to go up and down through the desert to find out these wanderers and to lead them into the promised land&#x27;.&quot;

In the summer of 1848, Clough wrote his long poem &quot;The Bothie of Toper-na-fuosich&quot;, a farewell to the academic life, following it up with poems from his time as student and tutor, in the shared publication &quot;Ambarvalia&quot;. In 1849, he witnessed another revolution, the siege of the Roman Republic, which inspired another long poem, &quot;Amours de Voyage&quot; (reprinted by Persephone Books in 2009). &quot;Easter Day&quot;, written in Naples, was a passionate denial of the Resurrection and the forerunner of the unfinished poem &quot;Dipsychus&quot;.

Since 1846, Clough had been financially responsible for his mother and sister (following the death of his father and younger brother and the marriage of his elder brother). In the autumn of 1849, to provide for them, he became principal of University Hall, a hostel for Unitarian students at University College, London, but found its ideology as oppressive as that which he had left behind in Oxford. He soon found that he disliked London, in spite of the friendship of Thomas Carlyle and his wife Jane Welsh Carlyle.

A prospect of a post in Sydney led him to engage himself to Blanche Mary Shore Smith, daughter of Samuel Smith, of Combe Hurst, Surrey and Mary Shore (sister to William Nightingale) but when that failed to materialize, he travelled in 1852 to Cambridge, Massachusetts, encouraged by Ralph Waldo Emerson. There he remained for several months, lecturing and editing Plutarch for the booksellers, until in 1853 the offer of an examinership in the Education Office brought him to London once more. He married Miss Shore Smith and pursued a steady official career, diversified only by an appointment in 1856 as secretary to a commission sent to study foreign military education. He devoted enormous energy to working as an unpaid secretarial assistant to his wife&#x27;s cousin Florence Nightingale. He wrote virtually no poetry for six years.

In 1860, his health began to fail. He visited first Great Malvern and Freshwater, Isle of Wight. From April 1861, he travelled strenuously in Greece, Turkey and France, where he met up with the Tennyson family. Despite his fragile health, this Continental tour renewed a state of euphoria like that of 1848–49, and he quickly wrote the elements of his last long poem, &quot;Mari Magno&quot;. His wife joined him on a voyage from Switzerland to Italy, where he contracted malaria.

He died in Florence on 13 November 1861. He is buried in the English Cemetery there, in a tomb that his wife and sister had Susan Horner design from Jean-François Champollion&#x27;s book on Egyptian hieroglyphs. Matthew Arnold wrote the elegy of &quot;Thyrsis&quot; to his memory.

Clough and his wife had three children: Arthur, Florence, and Blanche Athena. The youngest child, Blanche Athena Clough (1861–1960), devoted her life to Newnham College, Cambridge, where her aunt (his sister Anne) was principal.

== Writings ==
Shortly before he left Oxford, during the Great Famine of Ireland of 1845–1849, Clough wrote an ethical pamphlet addressed to the undergraduates, with the title, &quot;A Consideration of Objections against the Retrenchment Association at Oxford&quot; (1847). His Homeric pastoral &quot;The Bothie of Toper-na-fuosich&quot;, afterwards renamed &quot;Tober-na-Vuolich&quot; (1848), and written in hexameter is full of socialism, reading-party humours and Scottish scenery. &quot;Ambarvalia&quot; (1849), published jointly with his friend Thomas Burbidge, contains shorter poems of various dates from circa 1840 onwards.

&quot;Amours de Voyage&quot;, a novel in verse, was written at Rome in 1849; &quot;Dipsychus&quot;, a rather amorphous satire, at Venice in 1850; and the idylls which make up &quot;Mari Magno, or Tales on Board&quot;, in 1861. A few lyric and elegiac pieces, later in date than the &quot;Ambarvalia&quot;, complete Clough&#x27;s poetic output. His only considerable enterprise in prose was a revision of a 17th-century translation of Plutarch (called the &quot;Dryden Translation,&quot; but actually the product of translators other than Dryden) which occupied him from 1852, and was published as &quot;Plutarch&#x27;s Lives&quot; (1859).

Clough&#x27;s output is small and much of it appeared posthumously. Anthony Kenny notes that the editions prepared by Clough&#x27;s widow, Blanche, have &quot;been criticized ... for omitting, in the interests of propriety, significant passages in &quot;Dipsychus&quot; and other poems.&quot; But editing Clough&#x27;s literary remains has proven a challenging task even for later editors. Kenny goes on to state that &quot;it was no mean feat to have placed almost all of Clough&#x27;s poetry in the public domain within a decade, and to have secured for it general critical and popular acclaim.&quot;

His long poems have a certain narrative and psychological penetration, and some of his lyrics have a strength of melody to match their depth of thought. He has been regarded as one of the most forward-looking English poets of the 19th century, in part due to a sexual frankness that shocked his contemporaries. He often went against the popular religious and social ideals of his day, and his verse is said to have the melancholy and the perplexity of an age of transition, although &quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot; suggests that he did not lack certain Christian beliefs of his own, and in particular a belief in the afterlife where the struggle for virtue will be rewarded. His work is interesting to students of meter, owing to the experiments which he made, in the &quot;Bothie&quot; and elsewhere, with English hexameters and other types of verse formed upon classical models.

Clough wrote the short poem &quot;Say Not the Struggle Naught Availeth&quot;, a rousing call invoking military metaphors to keep up the good fight; which fight is unspecified, but it was written in the wake of the defeat of Chartism in 1848. Other short poems include &quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot;, an exploration of Christian faith and doubt, and &quot;The Latest Decalogue&quot;, a satirical take on the Ten Commandments.

&quot;The Latest Decalogue&#x27;s&quot; couplet on murder, &quot;Thou shalt not kill; but needst not strive officiously to keep alive:&quot; is often quoted – usually out of context – in debates on medical ethics in the sense that it is not right to struggle to keep terminally ill people alive, especially if they are suffering. Further, this couplet influenced Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Three Laws of Robotics (in particular, the First Law&#x27;s &quot;or through inaction&quot; clause). Broadcaster Geoffrey Robertson QC used the phrase in an episode of his television series, Geoffrey Robertson&#x27;s Hypotheticals (&quot;Affairs of the Heart,&quot; ABC, 1989), illustrating this point of view; it is unclear whether Robertson was aware Clough&#x27;s version of the Fifth Commandment had nothing to do with the alleviation of suffering but was instead referring to those who do not afford—in any circumstances—due respect to the sanctity of human life. Clough himself gives no indication that the couplet on murder might refer to the medical profession in general or to the treatment of the terminally ill in particular; indeed, the entire text of &quot;The Latest Decalogue&quot; satirizes the hypocrisy, materialism, the selective ethics and self-interest common to all of mankind.
This bitter judgement of humanity should be balanced against the more compassionate view he displays in other poems such as &quot;Through A Glass Darkly&quot;: &quot;Ah yet when all is thought and said, the heart still overrules the head; still what we hope we must believe, and what is given us receive&quot;.

In the novel &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; by John Fowles, several chapters have epigraphs from poems by Clough: &quot;Duty&quot; (1841), &quot;The Bothie of Toper-na-fuosich&quot; (1848) and &quot;Poems&quot; (1841–1852).

<text>William Shirley (2 December 1694 – 24 March 1771) was a British Army officer and colonial administrator who served as the governor of the British American colonies of Massachusetts Bay and the Bahamas. He is best known for his role in organizing the successful capture of Louisbourg during King George&#x27;s War, and for his role in managing military affairs during the French and Indian War. He spent most of his years in the colonial administration of British North America working to defeat New France, but his lack of formal military training led to political difficulties and his eventual downfall.

Politically well connected, Shirley began his career in Massachusetts as advocate general in the admiralty court, and quickly became an opponent of Governor Jonathan Belcher. He joined with Belcher&#x27;s other political enemies to bring about Belcher&#x27;s recall, and was appointed Governor of Massachusetts Bay in Belcher&#x27;s place. He successfully quieted political divisions within the province, and was able to bring about united action against New France when King George&#x27;s War began in 1744. The successful capture of Louisbourg, which Shirley had a major role in organizing, was one of the high points of his administration.

After King George&#x27;s War Shirley became mired in disputes over funding and accounting for the war effort, and returned to England in 1749 to deal with political and legal matters arising from those disputes. He was then assigned to a commission established by Great Britain and France to determine the colonial borders in North America. His hard-line approach to these negotiations contributed to their failure, and he returned to Massachusetts in 1753.

Military matters again dominated Shirley&#x27;s remaining years in Massachusetts, with the French and Indian War beginning in 1754. Shirley led a military expedition to reinforce Fort Oswego in 1755, and became Commander-in-Chief, North America upon the death of General Edward Braddock.

Notably, as commander-in-chief, Shirley knew George Washington, who served under his command. In 1756, Shirley wrote a letter advocating in favor of a promotion for George Washington, writing, &quot;I do therefore give it as my Opinion that Capt. Dagworthy who now acts under a Commission from the Governor of the Province of Maryland, and where there are no regular Troops join&#x27;d, can only take Rank as Provincial Captain and of Course is under the Command of all Provincial Field Officers, and in case it shall happen, that Colonel Washington and Capt. Dagworthy should join at Fort Cumberland. It is my Orders that Colonel Washington should take the Command.&quot;

His difficulties in organizing expeditions in 1755 and 1756 were compounded by political disputes with New York politicians, and over military matters with Indian agent Sir William Johnson. These disagreements led to his recall in 1757 as both commander-in-chief and as governor. In his later years he served as governor of the Bahamas, before returning to Massachusetts, where he died.

==Early life==
William Shirley, the son of William and Elizabeth Godman Shirley, was born on 2 December 1694 at Preston Manor in East Sussex, England. He was educated at Pembroke College, Cambridge, and then read law at the Inner Temple in London. In 1717 his grandfather died, leaving him Ote Hall in Wivelsfield and some funds, which he used to purchase a clerkship in London. About the same time, he married Frances Barker, with whom he had a large number of children. He was called to the bar in 1720. Although his inheritance had been substantial (about £10,000), he cultivated an expensive lifestyle, and suffered significant financial reverses in the depression of 1721. The financial demands of his large family (he and Frances had eight children by 1731) prompted him to seek an appointment in the North American colonies. His family was connected by marriage to the Duke of Newcastle, who became an important patron and sponsor of Shirley&#x27;s advancement, and to that of Arthur Onslow, the Speaker of the House of Commons. Armed with letters of introduction from Newcastle and others (but no appointment), Shirley arrived in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1731.

==Advocate general==
Shirley was initially received with indifference by Massachusetts governor Jonathan Belcher, who refused him patronage positions that became available. In 1733 Shirley sought to secure from David Dunbar the commission as the crown surveyor general, but Dunbar eventually decided to retain the office. Influence from Newcastle eventually yielded Shirley a position as advocate general in the admiralty court. Belcher resisted further entreaties from Newcastle to promote Shirley, and Shirley began using his position to actively prosecute Belcher supporters whose illegal logging activities came under his jurisdiction.
Shirley also made common cause with Samuel Waldo, a wealthy merchant and major landowner in the province eastern district (present-day Maine) where Belcher&#x27;s lax enforcement of timber-cutting laws was harming his business with the Royal Navy. In 1736 Shirley sent his wife to London to lobby on his behalf against Belcher. Waldo also eventually went to London; the combination of Shirley&#x27;s connection to Newcastle and Waldo&#x27;s money soon made inroads in the colonial administration. When these were joined by discontented New Hampshire interests (Belcher was also governor of New Hampshire), a full-scale offensive was launched in the late 1730s to unseat Belcher. This included at least one forged letter on the part of Belcher opponents in an attempt to discredit the governor, which Shirley denounced. By 1738 Newcastle was in a dominant position in not just the colonial administration, but also in the British government as an opponent of Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole, and he actively encouraged Belcher&#x27;s opponents.

In 1739 the Privy Council reprimanded Belcher, voted to separate the Massachusetts and New Hampshire governorships, and began debating the idea of replacing the governor. The exact reasons for Belcher&#x27;s dismissal have been a recurring subject of scholarly interest, due to the many colonial, imperial, and political factors at play. Two principal themes within these analyses are Belcher&#x27;s acquisition of many local enemies, and the idea that good imperial governance in London eventually required his replacement. Before the issues of 1739 most of the efforts to unseat Belcher had failed: Belcher himself noted in that year that &quot;the warr I am ingag&#x27;d in is carrying on in much the same manner as for 9 years past.&quot; Historian Stephen Foster further notes that someone as powerful as Newcastle was at the time generally had much weightier issues to deal with than arbitrating colonial politics. In this instance, however, imperial and colonial considerations coincided over the need for Massachusetts to provide a significant number of troops for Newcastle&#x27;s proposed West Indies expedition in the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear. In April 1740 Newcastle in effect offered Shirley the opportunity to prove, in the light of Belcher&#x27;s political difficulties, that he could more effectively raise troops than the governor could. Shirley consequently engaged in recruiting, principally outside Massachusetts (where Belcher refused his offers of assistance, understanding what was going on), and deluged Newcastle with documentation of his successes while Belcher was preoccupied with a banking crisis. Newcastle handed the issue off to Martin Bladen, secretary to the Board of Trade and a known Belcher opponent. The Board of Trade then apparently decided, based on the weight of the extant evidence, that Belcher needed to be replaced. In April 1741 the Privy Council approved William Shirley&#x27;s commission as governor of Massachusetts, and Benning Wentworth&#x27;s commission as governor of New Hampshire was issued the following June.

==Governor of Massachusetts==
When Shirley assumed the governorship of Massachusetts in August 1741, he was immediately confronted with a currency crisis. The province had been suffering for many years with inflation caused by issuance of increasing quantities of paper currency. Late in Belcher&#x27;s tenure, competing banking proposals had been made in a bid to address the issue, and a popular proposal for a bank secured by real estate had been enacted. This bank (the controversy over it having contributed to Belcher&#x27;s recall) had been dissolved by an act of parliament, and Shirley had to negotiate the dissolution of the bank&#x27;s assets and reclamation of the notes it had issued. In this process, which occupied the rest of 1741, Shirley deftly navigated legislation through the provincial assembly that provided a schedule for redeeming the bank&#x27;s currency without causing the bank&#x27;s principal owners to collapse under a deluge of redemptions.

With rising tensions Shirley acted to strengthen the military defenses of the colony. He created a series of provincial companies along the frontier. These included Burke&#x27;s Rangers and Gorham&#x27;s Rangers which became the model for Shirley&#x27;s more famous creation Roger&#x27;s Rangers.

===Outbreak of war===

Britain captured Acadia from France in Queen Anne&#x27;s War (1702–1713), but the Treaty of Utrecht left Cape Breton Island in French hands, and did not clearly demarcate a boundary between New France and the British colonies on the Atlantic coast. To protect the crucial passageway of the Saint Lawrence River into the heart of New France, France built a strong fortress at Louisbourg on the Atlantic coast of Cape Breton Island.

When Shirley took office, relations between France and Britain were strained, and there was a possibility that Britain would be drawn into the War of the Austrian Succession, which had started on the European mainland in 1740. Shirley was able to finesse his restrictions on the production of paper currency to achieve an updating of the province&#x27;s defences, and in 1742 requested permission from the Board of Trade for the printing of additional currency should war break out. This permission was granted in 1743, along with a warning that war with France was likely. France declared war against Britain in March 1744, and forces from Louisbourg raided the British fishing port of Canso on the northern end of mainland Nova Scotia before its residents were aware they were at war. French privateers also began preying on British and colonial vessels. British colonial governors along the coast, including Shirley, sent colonial guard ships and authorized their own privateers in response, neutralizing the French activity.
Canso was used by New England fishermen, and as such its fall was of interest to Massachusetts. Shirley had, prior to its capture, received a request for assistance from the lieutenant governor of Nova Scotia, Paul Mascarene, for support in the defence of Annapolis Royal. In response to the fall of Canso and a second, urgent request from Mascarene, Shirley promptly despatched two companies of volunteers to Annapolis Royal. The timely arrival of these troops in early July broke up a siege.

John Bradstreet, who had been captured at Canso and held prisoner at Louisbourg, returned to New England in a prisoner exchange, and gave a detailed report to Shirley that emphasised the weaknesses of the French fort. William Vaughn, who owned several businesses in Maine that were vulnerable to raids from New France, toured New England advocating an expedition to capture Louisbourg. Shirley and other leaders in New England and New York sent letters to colonial authorities in London seeking support for such an expedition, citing the vulnerable conditions at Louisbourg. Vaughn and Bradstreet wanted to attack Louisbourg that winter with an all-colonial force. Shirley doubted the practicality of that plan, but in January 1745 submitted it to the provincial assembly (General Court), which declined to support the plan, but did request that Britain undertake an attack on Louisbourg.

Vaughn continued to advocate for a quick all-American expedition, enlisting the support of fishing captains, merchants and 200 &quot;principal gentlemen&quot; of Boston. Shirley called the General Court into session to discuss the matter once more, and the proposal was submitted to a committee chaired by William Pepperrell. The committee reported favourably on the plan, and it was approved by a single vote when several opponents were absent from the chamber.

Shirley appointed a reluctant William Pepperrell to command the expedition, William Vaughn was appointed colonel, but without a command position, and John Bradstreet was appointed as a military advisor to Pepperrell. Shirley requested support for the expedition from Peter Warren, commodore of the Royal Navy squadron in the West Indies, but Warren declined due to the strenuous objections of his captains. This news arrived in Boston just as the expedition was preparing to leave.

Despite the absence of support from the Royal Navy, the New England expedition set out in March 1745 for Louisbourg. More than 4,000 men on more than 90 transports (mainly fishing boats and coastal traders), escorted by six colonial guard ships, descended on Canso, where the expedition waited for the ice to clear from Gabarus Bay, the site just south of Louisbourg that had been chosen for the troop landing. Starting on 22 April the expedition was joined by four Royal Navy warships under the command of Commodore Warren, who received orders (issued in January, but not received until after his previous refusal) to assist the expedition.

===Siege of Louisbourg===

The provincial forces began landing at Gabarus Bay on 30 April, and laid siege to the fortress while the British ships blockaded the harbour. The Americans began suffering battle losses, while the British naval officers, who had a low opinion of American soldiers, grew increasingly critical of the American efforts. Warren tried to exert control over the provincial troops, but Pepperrell resisted him. Louisbourg surrendered on 17 June. The Americans lost 180 men in combat, to disease or at sea during the siege, while the Royal Navy ships did not fire on the fortress, and lost just one sailor. As the victors settled into occupation of Louisbourg, friction grew between the Americans and the British. The terms of surrender guaranteed the French in all of their possessions; there was no plunder for the American troops. On the other hand, the Royal Navy had captured several rich French prizes, and British sailors on shore leave bragged to the Americans about how rich they were going to be from their shares.

The American troops had signed up to capture Louisbourg, and expected to go home after siege ended. The British government, who had believed that the provincial troops were incapable of capturing Louisbourg on their own, had made no plans to send British troops to take over occupation of the fortress. When it became evident that British troops would not be relieving the provincials until after winter had passed, Governor Shirley travelled to Louisbourg to raise the morale of the troops. His first speech to the troops had little effect, and some troops were close to mutiny. In a second speech Shirley promised to send home more troops immediately, and provide higher pay and better supplies for those who stayed until spring. Honors from the British government were sparse; Pepperrell was made a baronet, he and Shirley were made colonels in the British Army with the right to raise their own regiments, and Warren was promoted to rear admiral.

===Aborted campaign===
Shirley had engaged in the Louisbourg campaign primarily as a way to ensure British interests in the Atlantic fisheries. The victory, however, made him expand his vision to encompass the possibility of capturing all of New France. After capturing the French fort he wrote to Newcastle, proposing a series of expeditions to gain control of all of North America as far west as the Mississippi River, starting with one that would go up the Saint Lawrence from Louisbourg. Upon his return to Boston, Shirley began making preparations for such an expedition. In May 1746 he received plans for London outlining an attempt on Quebec using Royal Navy and provincial forces, while a second expedition was to attack Fort Saint-Frédéric on Lake Champlain. Shirley stepped up recruiting in Massachusetts and asked neighboring governors to contribute men and resources to the effort. Expected support from Britain never arrived, however, and the 1746 expeditions were called off.

While waiting for definite word from London of plans for 1747 Shirley beefed up the province&#x27;s western defenses, and in the spring of 1747 he began sending supplies to the Hudson River valley in anticipation of a move toward Fort Saint-Frédéric. Word then arrived from Newcastle that the British establishment would not support any expeditions against New France. The drop in military spending that resulted had negative consequences on the Massachusetts economy, harming Shirley&#x27;s popularity.

Shirley personally profited from the supply activities surrounding the Louisbourg expedition. In 1746 he used the funds to purchase an estate in Roxbury, on which he built an elaborate mansion, now known as the Shirley-Eustis House. Before the building was complete his wife died of a fever in August 1746; she was interred in King&#x27;s Chapel.

===Impressment crisis===

While Governor Shirley was at Louisbourg trouble had been brewing between the Royal Navy and the people of Boston. The Navy had long sought to press Americans into service on its ships. Impressment was a long-standing practice in Britain, but its application in America was resisted by the colonists. In 1702 Fort William on Castle Island had fired on a Royal Navy ship as it tried to leave Boston Harbour with six recently impressed men aboard. As a result of American complaints (reinforced by British merchants), Parliament in 1708 banned impressment in the American colonies. Navy leaders argued that the American exemption from impressment had been in force only during Queen Anne&#x27;s War, which ended in 1713. In practice, Royal Navy captains had to apply to colonial governors for a license to press men. In late November 1745 a fight between a press gang and some sailors staying in a boarding house in Boston left two of the sailors with fatal injuries. Two members of the press gang were charged with murder and convicted, but were released when the indictment was found invalid.

Two years later Commodore Charles Knowles, who served as Governor of Louisbourg after its capture, had a large number of seamen from Boston harbour impressed for service in his squadron. A mob of more than 300 men seized three naval officers and a deputy sheriff and beat the sheriff. The mob then went to Governor Shirley&#x27;s house, demanding the release of the men impressed by Knowles. Shirley tried to call out the militia, but they did not respond. Shirley did succeed in getting the naval officers into his house, and the mob eventually left. Later in the day Shirley went to the Town House to meet the people. The mob, now consisting of several thousand people, attacked the Town House, breaking many windows in the building. Shirley spoke to the mob and promised to present their demands to Commodore Knowles. The mob left, intending to find a Royal Navy ship to burn.

After Shirley had returned home that afternoon, the mob, which had seized another naval officer and several petty officers, returned to his house. Shirley ordered a number of armed men who were protecting his house to fire at the mob, but William Pepperrell was able to stop Shirley&#x27;s men from firing and to persuade the mob to leave. In the meantime, Commodore Knowles threatened to bombard Boston with his squadron. It was only after the Massachusetts Council adopted resolutions in support of the demands of the mob that the situation became quieter in Boston. The mob eventually released its hostages and Knowles released the impressed seamen.

===Compensation and currency===
Another issue of contention was compensation to the American colonies by Britain for the costs of the expedition against Louisbourg and the long occupation by American troops until the British Army finally took over. This presented Shirley with a problem, because the expedition&#x27;s leaders, including his former ally Samuel Waldo, grossly inflated their claimed costs. Waldo used Shirley&#x27;s unwillingness to openly act against him to begin his own efforts to topple the governor. Shirley was only able to forestall this effort by promising the colonial administration that he would achieve financial stability in the province by retiring its paper currency.
The British government was also slow in responding to requests for compensation. While waiting for a response, the question of how to use any compensation was debated in provincial newspapers and pamphlets. Some, such as Samuel Adams (father of the famous American Revolution leader), advocated placing the money in London banks to serve as backing for the paper currency issued by the colonies. Others, including William Douglass and Thomas Hutchinson, speaker of the General Court, favoured using the compensation to redeem the paper currency and give Massachusetts a hard currency. In 1748 the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle returned Louibourg to France, with Massachusetts still awaiting compensation for its seizure.

In the meantime, Governor Shirley had been trying to finance a campaign to capture Fort St. Frédéric (at present-day Crown Point, New York), for which he issued more paper money. The campaign was abandoned when the colonies failed to support it, but the resulting inflation helped turn supporters of Shirley against him. The loss of Louisbourg increase public dissatisfaction with Shirley, who was seen as complicit in British scheming against the American colonies. Even William Pepperrell joined the large number of citizens calling for Shirley&#x27;s removal. Samuel Adams edited and Gamaliel Rogers and Daniel Fowle published &quot;The Independent Advertiser&quot;, which regularly criticised the British government and Shirley&#x27;s administration. The paper published several of Shirley&#x27;s letters to officials in Britain that were critical of Americans, and regularly called for the governor&#x27;s removal. William Douglass, a prominent physician in Boston, wrote a series of pamphlets (published by Rogers and Fowle) attacking Shirley, Commodore Knowles, and the whole conduct of the campaign for Louisbourg and its occupation. Both Shirley and Knowles sued Douglass for libel, but lost their cases in court.

Shirley&#x27;s conflict with Samuel Waldo over expenses eventually reached a high pitch: Shirley had successfully attached some of Waldo&#x27;s assets in legal action, which Waldo had countered with further legal action. Shirley appealed these actions to London, and was granted permission (received in August 1749) to travel to London to deal with the matter. He sailed for Britain in September 1749, just before the long promised compensation reached Boston. Under legislation shepherded by Thomas Hutchinson, the specie delivered was used to retire the paper currency. While Shirley was abroad, Hutchinson, Andrew Oliver, and others served as his surrogates, and he carefully instructed Lieutenant Governor Spencer Phips to not give his enemies opportunities to manoeuvre in his absence.

==European interlude==
In London Shirley met with Newcastle and the colonial secretary, the Duke of Bedford to discuss colonial matters and his situation. Newcastle ordered the military books of Waldo and Pepperrell to be scrutinized; the analysis was found to confirm Shirley&#x27;s position. Shirley&#x27;s accounts were also examined, and were found to be &quot;made up with great exaction&quot;, &quot;more conformable to his Majesty&#x27;s orders ... than any other of the colonies.&quot;
Shirley also communicated political concerns over which he and New York governor George Clinton had commiserated. While he was in London, word arrived that Clinton wanted to leave his post. Shirley applied to Newcastle for the job, but was turned down. Newcastle may have been upset with Shirley, who had accepted an unexpected offer from Bedford to participate in a commission established to delineate the boundaries between the British and French territories in North America. The commission was set to meet in Paris, and Shirley saw it as an opportunity to advance his expansionist views. Newcastle and Bedford were at the time involved in a political struggle, and Newcastle was unhappy that Shirley had accepted Bedford&#x27;s offer. Shirley was able to convince Newcastle that his experience and position would be of use in the negotiations.

The commission met in Paris, and Shirley was accompanied by William Mildmay, a somewhat mild-mannered merchant, as cocommissioner. Shirley adopted a hard line in the negotiations, arguing in a technical and lawyerly fashion for an expansive reading of British territory; he claimed all territory east of a line from the Kennebec River north to the Saint Lawrence River, while the French claimed all of that area except peninsular Nova Scotia. Shirley&#x27;s approach served to harden negotiating positions and bogged the commission&#x27;s work down in minutiae. When Mildmay complained of this to London, Bedford rebuked Shirley for spending too much effort on trivialities. While the negotiations dragged on, both French and British operatives were actively expanding their interests in the Ohio River valley, raising tensions.

In 1751 Shirley incited a minor scandal when he married Julie, the young daughter of his Paris landlord. He was recalled to London after Mildmay complained that Shirley was taking actions without consulting him. Shirley returned to London convinced that the French needed to be driven from North America. Mildmay attempted to continue the negotiations, believing that he could overcome Shirley&#x27;s previous obstructionism, but the negotiations ended in failure.

Shirley renewed his application for the New York governorship, but was snubbed by Newcastle, who was upset over Shirley&#x27;s marriage. He was instead ordered to return to Massachusetts. This he did, leaving his wife in London. It is unclear if they ever saw each other again: biographer John Schutz believes they did not, but family lore is that they were reunited after Shirley left the Massachusetts governorship.

==Return to Massachusetts==
The opposition in Massachusetts to Shirley had died down while he was in England and Paris. Shirley soon had to deal with the increasing conflict on the frontier with French Canada. Tensions had been increasing, particularly in the Ohio Country, where British and French traders were coming into conflict. When (false) rumors reached Boston in 1754 of French military activity on the province&#x27;s northern frontier (Maine), Shirley was quick to organize an expedition to the Kennebec River to bolster the area&#x27;s defenses. This expedition erected Fort Halifax in what is now Winslow, Maine. News of hostilities in the Ohio Country brought further urgency to that matter, as well as attendance at a planned conference of colonies at Albany, New York. Because of the urgency, and the support of politically powerful Maine landowners, Shirley&#x27;s relationship with the provincial assembly was relatively good. Shirley instructed the provincial representatives to the Albany Conference to seek a colonial union, but the provincial assembly (along with those of other provinces) rejected the conference&#x27;s proposals.

===Seven Years War: 1755 campaigns===
Shirley was approached by Nova Scotia Governor Charles Lawrence for assistance in dealing with the French threat on that province&#x27;s frontiers, suggesting that they collaborate on military actions there. Shirley and Lawrence believed their proposed expedition would also require assistance from Britain, and sent letters requesting the same. At the same time they ramped up preparations in anticipation of the request being approved. Shirley was also ordered to activate and recruit for his regiment, which was to serve in Braddock&#x27;s force. Because he could not leave the province he sent one of his sons to New York to recruit troops there; Massachusetts men were being drafted for the Nova Scotia expedition. He furthermore revived the idea of an expedition against Fort St. Frédéric, although he limited the first year&#x27;s action to the establishment of a fort at the southern end of Lake George, and sought to draw the leaders of neighboring colonies to assist in the operation. He mollified New York&#x27;s acting governor James DeLancey, who was generally hostile to Massachusetts interests, by proposing that the expedition be led by New York&#x27;s Indian commissioner, Colonel William Johnson. Johnson was at first reluctant, but Shirley was able to convince him to take the command.

Since the French and Indian War had become a matter of imperial concern, two British Army regiments under General Edward Braddock were sent to America. In written exchanges, Braddock announced his intention to use this force against Fort Duquesne in the Ohio Country, while Shirley unsuccessfully lobbied him to instead target Fort Niagara. At a conference of governors and military leaders in April 1755 Shirley favorably impressed Braddock. Braddock declared that Duquesne would be his target, but he authorized Shirley to take his regiment and that of Sir William Pepperrell to Fort Niagara, and confirmed Johnson&#x27;s command of the Lake George campaign. Braddock&#x27;s instructions only gave Shirley the vaguest command over Johnson, which was to later become a source of trouble. The two northern expeditions were to be made without logistical assistance from the regular army.

From the conference Shirley traveled to New York City, where he negotiated with merchants for supplying his expedition. The frosty relationship he had with Governor DeLancey continued; the DeLanceys objected to what they saw as Massachusetts interference in their provincial affairs. When Shirley moved to prevent New York agent Oliver DeLancey from recruiting in Connecticut, it caused a stink and threatened to derail planning for the New York expeditions. Shirley then created a breach with Johnson by attempting to siphon troops from Johnson&#x27;s command to increase his own force for the Fort Niagara expedition. The antagonism was furthered by the fact that the two expeditions were competing for supplies from the same sources, and was also exacerbated by ongoing border disputes between the provinces.

When Shirley and Johnson met in July 1755 before their respective expeditions set off, tension between the two men continued, and Johnson delayed decisions on assigning Indian auxiliaries to Shirley&#x27;s campaign, observing that much of the expedition was traveling through friendly Iroquois territory, where they would not yet be needed. Shirley took offense at this as an act of insubordination. Believing he outranked Johnson, Shirley next sought to bypass the Indian agent and negotiate directly with the tribes for recruits, but Johnson and his subordinates actively opposed the move. The Iroquois also objected to the presence of Shirley&#x27;s recruiting agent, Colonel John Lydius, with whom they had outstanding issues over past land transactions. The situation was not made easier by the fact that neither Johnson nor Shirley had ever commanded expeditions of the size and scope proposed.
Shirley&#x27;s expedition reached Fort Oswego in mid-August. The trek up the Mohawk River had been slowed by low water, and it was being incompetently supplied, resulting in a shortage of provisions. Shirley learned en route that General Braddock had died in the aftermath of 13 July Battle of the Monongahela, which also claimed the life of Shirley&#x27;s son William. As a result, he became temporary commander-in-chief of North American forces. His expedition then became bogged down at Fort Oswego by the need to improve its defenses, and the ongoing provisioning crisis. In a council on 18 September it was decided to proceed with plans to reach Fort Niagara, but one week later the decision was reversed. Shirley returned to Albany, preoccupied with the need to manage the entire British war effort on the continent.

William Johnson&#x27;s expedition fared little better than Shirley&#x27;s. He reached the southern end of Lake George, where his forces had an inconclusive encounter with French forces on 8 September, and began work on Fort William Henry. Rumors of French movements brought a flurry of activity in November, but when the opposition failed to materialize, much of Johnson&#x27;s force abandoned the camp to return home. Shirley had to pressure New England&#x27;s governors to assign militia to the new posting for the winter.

In Nova Scotia, Governor Lawrence had easily captured Fort Beauséjour, and had then embarked on what has since become known as the Great Expulsion, the forcible removal of more than 12,000 Acadians from Nova Scotia. When some of the ships carrying the Acadians entered Boston Harbor in early December 1755, Shirley ordered that they not disembark. For three winter months, until March 1756, the Acadians remained on the ships, where half died from the cold weather and malnutrition.

===Seven Years War: 1756 campaigns===

During the winter of 1755–56 Shirley&#x27;s feud with Johnson continued. Johnson, who was being advised by Thomas Pownall, continued to assert his exclusive authority over interactions with Indians, and renewed complaints about Shirley&#x27;s interference in recruiting for the 1755 campaign. In one letter Johnson wrote that Shirley had &quot;become my inveterate enemy&quot; who would do everything he could &quot;to blast if he can my character.&quot; Johnson made common cause with the DeLanceys (to whom he was related by marriage) in their dislike of Shirley. They all fed unflattering reports to the new New York governor, Sir Charles Hardy, who forwarded them on to London. Shirley was unaware of this looming threat to his authority.

As commander-in-chief, Shirley made a grandiose proposal for the 1756 campaign season in November 1755, continuing the routes of attack begun in 1755 and adding an expedition to Quebec via the Kennebec River. However, the complaints against him had reached the Duke of Newcastle, who felt he needed someone less embroiled in controversies with other leaders in charge of military matters in North America. British leaders had also received intercepted letters destined for France that some believed might have been written by Shirley, in part because he married a Frenchwoman. Thomas Pownall traveled to London in early 1756 and further denounced Shirley to the colonial administration. Shirley did not learn of these matters until April 1756, by which time the British leadership had already decided to replace him as commander-in-chief.

While waiting for his replacement (Lord Loudoun) Shirley made every effort to advance supplies and reinforcements to the Fort Oswego garrison, which had been on short rations for the winter, and whose supply line had been interrupted by the Battle of Fort Bull in March 1756. He continued to mobilize resources and personnel for at least the Oswego and Lake George efforts, but his authority was waning due to widespread knowledge of his replacement. Military affairs continued to deteriorate on the New York frontier before Loudoun finally arrived in July 1756; Fort Oswego fell to the French on 10 August.

Although Shirley had been removed as commander-in-chief, he retained the Massachusetts governorship. He expected to lose even that post not long after his return to Boston in August. However, no replacement had yet been named, and Loudoun saw either Shirley&#x27;s interference or ineffectiveness in all that was wrong on the New York frontier. He also raised detailed questions about Shirley&#x27;s war-related expenditures, which he (and later historians) concluded was poorly disguised patronage spending. Loudoun and Shirley argued over many issues, including Shirley&#x27;s continuance of military preparations after January 1756, when Loudoun&#x27;s commission was issued. Shirley pointed out that British leadership could hardly expect preparations to cease in the interval between Loudoun&#x27;s commission and his arrival to take command. While he waited for a replacement to be announced, Shirley took depositions, gathered evidence to support his version of affairs, and worked to close his financial affairs down. (Loudoun was of the opinion that Shirley delayed his departure intentionally as a political maneuver.) He sailed for England in October 1756. Shirley would be formally replaced by Thomas Pownall in 1757.

==Later life==
Upon his arrival in London, Shirley was received by Newcastle and other sympathetic figures, but Newcastle had been forced from office by the poor showing in the war, and Shirley&#x27;s ongoing disagreements with Loudoun meant he was unlikely to receive another North American posting. Newcastle then withdrew his support from Shirley over a hearing into matters disputed between Loudoun and Shirley. Shirley was not granted formal hearings on other aspects of his conduct, and managed to convince Newcastle to overlook the matter of his &quot;muddled&quot; accounts. His prospects brightened when Loudoun and Pownall were both damaged by the continued poor military performance in North America (notably the debacle of the Siege of Fort William Henry in August 1757, which resulted in Loudoun&#x27;s recall). These failures served to rehabilitate Shirley and bring him back into Newcastle&#x27;s good graces.
In late 1758 Shirley was commissioned as Governor of the Bahamas. This was followed in early 1759 with a promotion to lieutenant general. After a lengthy passage, Shirley arrived in the Bahamas on 31 December, when his ship was wrecked on a reef in the islands. He eventually arrived without incident or injury at Nassau and assumed the reins of power. His rule was quiet; dealing with smugglers in the islands was the major issue demanding the governor&#x27;s attention. In part to combat illicit trade he lobbied the London government that Nassau be established as a free port. Although he was influential in this regard, Nassau did not receive this status until after he left office. He also oversaw renovations to the governor&#x27;s mansion, and promoted the construction of churches with funding from the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. In 1765, after his wife&#x27;s death, he took his children to England so that they could be properly cared for. He returned to the islands, where he had to deal with protests of the recently enacted Stamp Act. When he proposed the use of the stamps on official documents to the local assembly, the reaction in opposition was so visceral that Shirley dissolved the body. By the time the next assembly met, the Stamp Act had been repealed.

His health failing, Shirley was eventually replaced as governor by his son Thomas, who was appointed in November 1767 and arrived to assume office the following year. Shirley sailed for Boston, where he took up residence in his old house in Roxbury with his daughter and son-in-law. There he died on 24 March 1771. After a state funeral, he was interred in King&#x27;s Chapel.

==Family and legacy==
Shirley married twice and had two sons and three daughters.

His elder son Thomas (later Sir Thomas) became a major general in the British army, was created a baronet in 1786 as &quot;Shirley baronets, of Oat Hall (1786)&quot; Sussex, and served, after his posting to the Bahamas, as Governor of Dominica and Governor of the Leeward Islands. Sir Thomas died in 1800. The Baronetcy became extinct after the death of Sir Thomas Shirley&#x27;s son Sir William Warden Shirley, 2nd Baronet (1772–1815).

Shirley&#x27;s other son, William Jr., was killed in 1755 at the Battle of the Monongahela whilst serving with Edward Braddock. Shirley&#x27;s eldest daughter Anne married John Erving, a member of the Massachusetts Governor&#x27;s Council; their daughter Anne married Duncan Stewart of Ardsheal, Chief of the Clan Stewart of Appin. Shirley&#x27;s youngest daughter Maria Catherina married John Erving Jnr.

Shirley built a family home in Roxbury between 1747 and 1751. He sold it to his daughter and son-in-law, Eliakim Hutchinson, in 1763. It later came into the hands of William Eustis, Governor of Massachusetts in the 19th century. Now known as the Shirley-Eustis House, it still stands at 33 Shirley Street. It has largely been restored and is a museum open to the public.

The town of Shirley, Massachusetts, was founded during his term as Massachusetts governor. The Winthrop, Massachusetts geographical feature Shirley Point and the former feature Shirley Gut are named for him. Shirley helped to establish a cod fishery in Winthrop in 1753. Shirley is also the namesake of Shirley Street in Halifax, Nova Scotia (which is parallel to Pepperell Street, named after William Pepperell).

<doc id="224676" wikidata="Q8012783" url="?curid=224676" title="William II Canynges">
<text>William II Canynges (c. 1399–1474) was an English merchant and shipper from Bristol, one of the wealthiest private citizens of his day and an occasional royal financier. He served as Mayor of Bristol five times and as MP for Bristol thrice. He was a generous patron of the arts in Bristol, particularly concerning the church of St Mary Redcliffe in Bristol, &quot;The crown of Bristol architecture&quot;. Following the death of his wife Joan in 1467, he renounced civic and commercial life and was ordained a priest in 1468, in which capacity he remained until his death six years later. His tomb effigy in St Mary&#x27;s later inspired the boy poet Thomas Chatterton to write the romantic poem &quot;&quot;.
==Background==

Canynges was born in Bristol in 1399 or 1400, a member of a wealthy family of merchants and cloth manufacturers in that city. He was one of the younger of seven children of John Canynges, who died as a young man in 1405, by his wife Joan Wotton. William&#x27;s eldest brother Thomas Canynges was Lord Mayor of London in 1456–7, having been elected Alderman for Aldgate ward in 1445, and was a Grocer. William&#x27;s grandfather William I Canynges (d. 1396) was also a great Bristol merchant and was also five times Mayor of Bristol and three times MP for Bristol, in 1383, 1384 and 1386. His second son John Canynges, the father of William II, was also prominent in Bristol civic life, serving twice as mayor and as MP for Bristol in 1383. His wife Joan Wotton survived him and married secondly in about 1408 Thomas Young, twice mayor of Bristol, by whom she had two successful sons, John Young, Alderman of London, Grocer and Lord Mayor of London in 1466, and Thomas Young (d. 1476) a lawyer of the Middle Temple, Recorder of Bristol from 1441 and MP for Bristol almost continuously, with one break in 1453, between 1435 and 1455. Thomas Young served as the other of Bristol&#x27;s two MPs during his half-brother William II Canynges&#x27;s terms as MP in 1450 and 1455, and before 1450 entered into the household of Richard, Duke of York (d. 1460), the Yorkist contender for heirship to the Throne then occupied by Henry VI (1422–1461).

==Marriage==

At some time before 1429 William married Joan Burton, from a prominent Bristol family. Her sister Isabel became the wife of William&#x27;s half-brother Thomas Young, with whom he served jointly for two terms as MP for Bristol. William and Joan had two sons, who were encouraged by their father to become members of the Gloucestershire gentry, yet both predeceased him, and thus ended the Canynges dynasty in Bristol. Joan died in September 1467, following which traumatic event William renounced his former life and entered the priesthood.

==Mercantile career==
Although Canynges benefitted from the wide trade connections of his forebears and a large inheritance, he does not seem to have followed them in the cloth manufacturing industry as his name was never recorded in the aulnage returns, but rather specialised in the shipping of cloth to south-west Europe. In 1436 he served as Constable of the Merchants of the Staple, a key post in the wool export trade, and became a Grocer in 1441, like his half-brother John Young.

===Invests in John Sturmy&#x27;s expedition===
He was an investor in the disastrous 1457 Mediterranean venture of fellow Bristol mayor and merchant Robert Sturmy. This was an expedition to the Aegean Sea seeking to break the Italian monopoly in trade with the Orient and to set up an English trading post in the Levant. His investors, including Canynges, financed the fitting out of three ships carrying cargoes of cloth, tin and lead. The fleet traded successfully in the Levant but was attacked by Genoese pirates near Malta which resulted in the loss of two ships, &quot;Katherine&quot; and &quot;Marie&quot;. Sturmy himself lost his life during the incident but his main partner John Heydon managed to return to Bristol. The king fined the Genoese traders in England £6,000 in damages, and imprisoned them and seized their assets until the fine should be paid. This put a stop to further English adventures in the Mediterranean for many years, but prompted a new look to westward lands, which bore fruit under John Cabot in 1497.

===Acquires large fleet===
He appears to have started to specialise in shipping the goods of others rather than trading on his own account. He owned a fleet of at least ten ships, as is stated in William Worcester&#x27;s &quot;Itineraries&quot;, one of the largest known in England at that time, and is said to have employed 800 sailors. Three of his ships exceeded 200 tons, then considered large: The &quot;Mary Canynges&quot; (400 tons), &quot;Mary Redcliffe&quot; (500 tons) and the &quot;Mary and John&quot; (900 tons). The last was considered by Worcester &quot;a monster&quot; and had cost £2666 13s. 4d. to build. His combined tonnage was almost 3,000 tons.

===Trade with Scandinavia===
Canynges also traded towards Scandinavia, exporting cloth and filling his homeward bound ships with fish. By special licence from the king of Denmark he enjoyed for some time a monopoly of the fish trade between Iceland, Finland and England, and he also competed successfully with the Flemish merchants in the Baltic Sea, obtaining a large share of their business.

==Political career==
Canynges&#x27;s civic career started in 1432 with his appointment as bailiff of Bristol and in 1438 as Sheriff. He was five times mayor of Bristol, first in September 1441 when still aged under 40. He served as Mayor also in 1449, 1456, 1461 and 1466. He was elected three times as MP for Bristol, in 1439, 1450–1 and 1455.

==Interaction with royalty==

At Bristol in 1456 he entertained Queen Margaret of Anjou, consort of the Lancastrian King Henry VI (1422–1461). William&#x27;s half-brother Thomas Young, whilst serving with him as the Bristol MPs in 1450, had proposed a motion in Parliament for the recognition of his Yorkist royal patron Richard, Duke of York (d. 1460) as heir to Henry&#x27;s throne, for which action he was imprisoned. Canynges appears to have shared his half-brother&#x27;s support for the Yorkist cause as in 1450 during his third term as mayor he prevented the sale in Bristol of gunpowder intended for use against the Duke. He also occupied Bristol Castle on the Duke&#x27;s instructions, holding it against his rival Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset (d. 1455). Whilst mayor in September 1461, following Henry&#x27;s deposition in that year, Canynges received in Bristol the Duke&#x27;s son, the new Yorkist King Edward IV (1461–1483), to whom he loaned 500 marks.

==Patron of arts==
Canynges undertook at his own expense the great work of rebuilding the great Bristol church of St Mary Redcliffe, and for a long time had a hundred workmen in his regular service for this purpose. He added to its jewels and equipment, and founded two chantries in 1466 and 1467 to which were attached two priests. He created an endowment of £340 to re-establish the two &quot;St Mary priests&quot; and three clerics. His house in Bristol with a fine Perpendicular Gothic oak roof was still standing in 1884. His contemporary John Shipward (d. 1473), a fellow Bristol merchant was a similarly generous patron of Bristol arts, having financed the building of the tower of St Stephen&#x27;s Church. Both followed in the footsteps of Walter Frampton (d. 1357), thrice Mayor of Bristol, who funded the building of the Church of St John the Baptist, Bristol.

==Takes Holy Orders==
The death of his wife Joan in September 1467 was a turning point in Canynges&#x27;s life, for he gave up his commercial and political life for the cloister. Before the Dissolution of the Monasteries Bristol was within the Diocese of Worcester, and it was under the care of Bishop John Carpenter of Worcester(d.1476) that his transformation to the clergy occurred. He first obtained the post of rector of St Alban&#x27;s, Worcester, and was admitted by the bishop on 19 September 1467 to the order of acolyte, and ordained priest by him on 16 April 1468. He was appointed a canon of the Collegiate Church of Westbury-on-Trym and prebendary of Goodringhill. He said mass for the first time in St Mary Redcliffe, the church to which he had been a generous patron, the following Whitsuntide. He moved his residence from Redcliffe to Westbury where he became dean in June 1469, and where he remained until his death five years later in 1474.

==Death and burial==

Canynges died on 17 or 19 November 1474
and was buried in St Mary Redcliffe Church, Bristol, where a canopied stone tomb was erected in the south aisle in his memory containing his effigy in red velvet mayoral robes, next to that of his wife Joan. A funeral service was held at Westbury-on-Trym, where a very high quality sculpted alabaster effigy of him was placed, dressed in clerical attire. Following the Dissolution of Westbury, the effigy was moved to St Mary Redcliffe Church, where it is now situated adjacent to the original monument, against the south wall of the south aisle. The tombstone of Canynges&#x27;s cook is set into the pavement nearby, decorated with incised cooking utensils of knife and sieve.

==Descendants==
The statesman George Canning, and Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe, were descendants of his family.

<doc id="224686" wikidata="Q219623" url="?curid=224686" title="Tekken">
<text>is a Japanese media franchise centered on a series of fighting games developed and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment (formerly Namco). The franchise also includes film and print adaptations.

The main games in the series follow the events of the King of Iron Fist Tournament, hosted by the &quot;Mishima Zaibatsu&quot;, where players control a plethora of characters to win the tournament and gain control of the company; the conflict between the Mishima family serves as the main focus of the series&#x27; plot, while players explore other characters&#x27; motivations in aiming to control the &quot;Zaibatsu&quot;.

Gameplay focuses on hand-to-hand combat with an opponent, with the gameplay system including blocks, throws, escapes, and ground fighting. The series later introduced combos and special moves, with characters also able to stage break arenas. &quot;Tekken&quot; is noted as being one of the first fighting games at the time to use 3D animation.

Japanese video game developer Namco began the series in 1994, with the release of the self-titled first entry. As of 2017, it has nine additional entries, eight spin-off games, and has been adapted into three feature films and other media. &quot;Tekken 2&quot;, as well as the third game &quot;Tekken 3&quot;, are considered landmark titles; they received critical acclaim for their gameplay and more immersive experience. Subsequent titles have followed this concept and received generally positive critical responses. It has been mentioned as early as 2015 by the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest running story in video games without reboots, retcons, or revisions. The Mishima saga covering the first ten games until &quot;Tekken 8&quot; was described as a story revolving around the Iron Fist Tournament and a family aiming to destroy each other.

The series has been universally acclaimed and commercially successful, having shipped over 58 million copies by 2024, making it the third best-selling fighting game franchise. The main series has been widely credited by critics and video game publications for raising the standards of fighting games and praised for its gameplay mechanics and replay value.

==Games==

All major installments of the series are originally arcade games, and the boards used to run them have traditionally been based on PlayStation hardware. Following their release in arcades, home releases in the series have mainly been for consoles in the PlayStation line.
===1994–1997: Original trilogy===

====&quot;Tekken&quot;====

The first game in the series, &quot;Tekken&quot;, was released in 1994, first as an arcade game and as a port for the PlayStation in 1995. The game features eight playable characters, each with their own sub-boss. The PlayStation version features remixes of the stage themes and also made the sub-bosses playable for a total of eighteen characters, including a costume swap for Kazuya (Devil Kazuya). In addition, a cutscene is unlocked when the player finishes arcade mode with each of the original eight characters. The canon ending of the game consists of Kazuya exacting revenge on his father Heihachi Mishima, beating him in the tournament and tossing him off the same cliff that he was thrown off by Heihachi.

====&quot;Tekken 2&quot;====

&quot;Tekken 2&quot; was released in 1995 in arcades and in 1996 for the PlayStation. A port was also made several years later for Zeebo. There are ten playable characters as well as fifteen to unlock, for a total of twenty-five characters. The home version features four new modes that would become staples to the series, which were Survival, Team Battle, Time Attack, and Practice. The game features remixes of the arcade versions&#x27; characters&#x27; themes, and a cutscene unlocked once the player completes the arcade mode. The canon ending of this game consists of Heihachi surviving the fall, entering the King of Iron Fist Tournament 2 and defeating Kazuya, throwing him into an erupting volcano and reclaiming the Mishima &quot;Zaibatsu&quot;. During the events of the second King of Iron First Tournament, Kazuya and Jun Kazama were mysteriously drawn to one another and became intimate.

====&quot;Tekken 3&quot;====

&quot;Tekken 3&quot; was released in arcades and for the PlayStation in 1997 and 1998, respectively. Due to the 19-year storyline span between the game and its predecessor, the game largely features a new cast of characters, including the debut of staple main character Jin Kazama, the child of Kazuya and Jun, as well as now-staple characters Ling Xiaoyu and Hwoarang, with a total of twenty-three characters. The home version includes a mode called &quot;Tekken&quot; Force, as well as the bonus &quot;Tekken Ball&quot; mode, and also includes remixes to the characters&#x27; themes from the arcade version. The canon ending of &quot;Tekken 3&quot; consists of Paul Phoenix defeating Ogre and leaving victorious. After its defeat, Ogre transforms into a monstrous creature, &quot;True Ogre&quot;. Jin Kazama faces True Ogre and defeats him, avenging his mother. With Ogre out of the way, Jin&#x27;s grandfather Heihachi shoots him, leaving him for dead. However, Jin survives, being revived by the Devil Gene he inherited from his father.
===1999–2004: Debut of team-battle oriented games===
====&quot;Tekken Tag Tournament&quot;====

&quot;Tekken Tag Tournament&quot; was released in 1999 in arcades and as a launch title for the PlayStation 2 in 2000. &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament&quot; features tag battles and includes almost all of the &quot;Tekken&quot; characters in the series up until that point in time, for a total of 34 characters. The game ran on the same arcade board with an updated &quot;Tekken 3&quot; engine, and thus saw major graphical upgrades when ported to the PlayStation 2. The home version features remixes of the characters&#x27; themes from the arcade version, and also features a bonus &quot;Tekken&quot; Bowl mode. A remastered version of the game, &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament HD&quot;, is included in the 2011 collection &quot;Tekken Hybrid&quot;, which also contained a playable demo of &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament 2&quot; and the film &quot;Tekken: Blood Vengeance&quot;.

====&quot;Tekken 4&quot;====

&quot;Tekken 4&quot; is the fifth installment of the series, released in 2001 in arcades and 2002 for the PlayStation 2. The home version includes a new Story mode that unlocks cutscenes when played, in contrast to previous installments in which such cutscenes were unlocked from playing the Arcade Mode. Gameplay revisions include the ability for the player to move about before the round begins, as well as walled-stages. For the first time, the themes used in the arcade mode are the same ones put into the home version. There are 23 characters to choose from. The story reveals that Kazuya survived the fall into the volcano from 20 years prior, and enters the King of Iron Fist Tournament 4 to take back the Mishima Zaibatsu. In the canonical ending, Kazuya and Heihachi are both defeated by Jin. Jin unwillingly transforms into his Devil form, but after glimpsing a vision of his mother, Jun (whom he had not seen in six years), he refrains from executing Heihachi.

====&quot;Tekken 5&quot;====

&quot;Tekken 5&quot; was released in arcades in 2004 and 2005 for the PlayStation 2, with a short period of time of transition from arcade to PlayStation, of two months in North America and four months in Japan. There are 32 characters to choose from, including staple newcomers Devil Jin and Osaka&#x27;s Asuka Kazama. Many of the characters who were removed in &quot;Tekken 3&quot; returned in &quot;Tekken 5&quot;. The home version includes a mode known as Devil Within, a variant of the &quot;Tekken&quot; Force mode introduced in &quot;Tekken 3&quot;. In the canonical ending, Jin Kazama defeats his great-grandfather Jinpachi Mishima (who took over the Mishima Zaibatsu shortly after the ending events of &quot;Tekken 4&quot;), and inherits the Mishima &quot;Zaibatsu&quot;.

===2005–present: Expansion and other projects===

====&quot;Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection&quot;====

Although &quot;Tekken&quot; games normally saw updates to the arcade versions, &quot;Tekken 5&quot; was the first installment in the series that had a revision significant enough that it was rereleased, with the subtitle &quot;Dark Resurrection&quot; in 2005. The game was ported to the PlayStation Portable in 2006 and features two new characters: Emilie &quot;Lili&quot; De Rochefort and Sergei Dragunov. Armor King was also reintroduced as a playable character in this revision. The game also introduces a ranking system to the series. The home version featured new modes, such as Ghost Mode, &quot;Tekken&quot; Dojo Mode, and the two bonus modes, Gold Rush mode, and a revised version of the &quot;Tekken&quot; Bowl mode introduced in &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament&quot;. The Devil Within mode from the PlayStation 2 version however, was absent. Namco Bandai saw the fan demand for a console version and a port for the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network was released in 2007, in full 1080p HD. The PlayStation 3 version also saw an update and was retitled &quot;Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection ONLINE&quot;, marking the first time in the series that online play was featured. The PlayStation 3 version also made Jinpachi Mishima playable (but not online).

====&quot;Tekken 6&quot;====

&quot;Tekken 6&quot; was originally released in arcades in 2007, followed by an updated version in 2008 titled &quot;Tekken 6: Bloodline Rebellion&quot;. The home version was based on &quot;Bloodline Rebellion&quot; and was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, marking the first time in the series that a game was multiplatform. The game features a Scenario Campaign mode, which follows gameplay from previous &quot;Tekken&quot; Force modes, which was playable online alongside standard versus. In the Scenario Campaign ending, after being defeated by Heihachi&#x27;s illegitimate son Lars Alexandersson (who suffered amnesia at one point during the Scenario Campaign), Jin Kazama is revealed to have wreaked havoc and waged war on the world to fill it with negative energy and generate a physical manifestation of Azazel, so that he himself can face and kill him, as he believed that killing Azazel may purge Jin himself from the Devil Gene inside his body. After the battle, Jin&#x27;s body is found by Raven, and the Devil Gene is still intact in his body.

====&quot;Tekken Tag Tournament 2&quot;====

&quot;Tekken Tag Tournament 2&quot; was released in Japanese arcades in 2011. Its console version was released the next year and is based on the updated arcade version called &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament 2 Unlimited&quot; that contained new features. The Wii U version, which served as a launch title for the console, includes a revised version of the &quot;Tekken&quot; Ball mode from &quot;Tekken 3&quot; and exclusive Nintendo themed costumes for each character, as well as a new mode that makes use of the mushrooms from the &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; franchise. Like the previous iteration, &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament 2&quot; includes nearly every character up to that point and a few exclusive characters. Lili&#x27;s butler Sebastian, Eddy Gordo’s disco-oriented alter ego Tiger Jackson, a new female wrestler character named Jaycee, who is actually Julia Chang in disguise but was made to differentiate the play style of Julia and her mother Michelle Chang, and Slim Bob a slender version of Bob. A demo version of &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament 2&quot; was released as part of &quot;Tekken Hybrid&quot; including exclusive designs for Devil and Devil Jin from the film &quot;&quot;. American rapper Snoop Dogg was featured in the game with his own stage and an original song by the rapper titled “Knocc ‘em Down”.

====&quot;Tekken 7&quot;====
In early 2014, Katsuhiro Harada expressed interest in continuing the series on PlayStation 4. &quot;Tekken 7&quot; was released in Japanese and Korean arcades in 2015. It is the first game in the series to be powered by the Unreal Engine. The game received an update, subtitled &quot;Fated Retribution&quot; and released to arcades on July 5, 2016, and featured the series&#x27; second, third, fourth and fifth guest characters, the guest characters appearing are Akuma from the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; franchise by Capcom, Geese Howard from SNK&#x27;s fighting game franchises, Noctis Lucis Caelum from the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise by Square Enix and Negan Smith from &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; franchise. The PlayStation 4 version was confirmed at Paris Games Week 2015, and features exclusive content as well as virtual reality support. The Xbox One and Microsoft Windows versions were released on June 2, 2017, alongside the PlayStation 4 version, and are based on the &quot;Fated Retribution&quot;. In the canonical ending, considered the conclusion of the Mishima saga, Heihachi takes control of the Zaibatsu, and attempts to expose Kazuya of the Devil Gene, after a failed attempt on capturing a missing Jin, who was found safely by his uncles Lars and Lee. In their final battle, Kazuya permanently kills Heihachi and throws him into an erupting volcano, whereas Jin, who recovered from his coma thanks to Lars and Lee, declares that he must kill Kazuya to end the cursed Mishima bloodline. It was also revealed that Heihachi killed his wife Kazumi in self-defense because of her possession of the Devil Gene and the fact that she had gained a split personality because of it, shortly after Kazuya was born. Few side playable characters’ storylines have their endings from &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament 2&quot; ties to this game.

====&quot;Tekken 8&quot;====

A teaser for a new mainline entry in the series was shown during &quot;Tekken 7&quot;&#x27;s tournament at EVO 2022, before being formally announced on September 13, 2022 during Sony&#x27;s &quot;State of Play&quot; presentation. It was released on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC through Steam on January 26, 2024. As a continuation from the seventh mainline game, it focuses on a conclusion of Kazuya and Jin&#x27;s enmity. In contrast to the seventh mainline game&#x27;s utility of Unreal Engine 4, &quot;Tekken 8&quot; will utilize Unreal Engine 5, making it the first fighting game to do so. This game was announced on January 6, 2023 to be co-developed with Arika, who also handles the recent patch(es) for &quot;Tekken 7&quot;.

====Spin-off and crossover games====

&quot;Tekken 3&quot; was also ported to the Game Boy Advance as &quot;Tekken Advance&quot; in 2001. &quot;Tekken 6&quot;-based &quot;Tekken 3D: Prime Edition&quot; was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2012. A free to play version of &quot;Tekken&quot; was released in 2013 for PSN as &quot;Tekken Revolution&quot;. &quot;Tekken Card Challenge&quot; was released on the WonderSwan, a Japan-exclusive handheld, in 1999. A spin-off action adventure game featuring series&#x27; character Nina Williams as the protagonist, &quot;Death by Degrees&quot;, released for the PS2 in 2005. &quot;Tekken Resolute&quot;, a 2D fighting game which was the first game not to include Heihachi Mishima, was released in 2010 for the J2ME platform, and &quot;Tekken Bowl&quot;, the bowling mini-game from &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament&quot;, was released in 2011 for the iOS operating system. &quot;Tekken Bowl&quot; was the first game not to include Yoshimitsu, Nina Williams, Paul Phoenix, or King. In 2013, a third mobile game titled &quot;Tekken Card Tournament&quot; was released by Namco Bandai to the App Store for iOS and Google Play Store on Android. That same year, Namco Bandai also released &quot;Tekken Arena&quot; to the Google Play Store on Android. On April 30, 2015, Namco released &quot;Galaga: Tekken 20th Anniversary Edition&quot;, a mobile game variant of &quot;Galaga&quot; featuring characters from the franchise. It was originally announced on April 1, 2015.

Namco and Capcom agreed to create crossover games of the &quot;Tekken&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter&quot; franchises. In 2012, &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot; was released, which was developed by Capcom and includes 2D gameplay mechanics as seen in &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;. Namco was also developing &quot;Tekken X Street Fighter&quot;, which would feature gameplay mechanics similar to &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament 2&quot;, but it was placed on hold indefinitely in 2016.

&quot;Pokkén Tournament&quot; was announced in August 2014, as a spin-off of the franchise set within the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise. It was initially released in Japan as an arcade game, but was released internationally on Wii U in 2016, and is also ported to Nintendo Switch.

&quot;Tekken Mobile&quot;, another spinoff, was released on March 1, 2018. Although it had a mixed reception from critics, it was well received by the public and exceeded one million downloads.

==Development==

&quot;Tekken&quot; was not originally conceived as a fighting game. The project began as an internal Namco test case for animating 3D character models, and eventually incorporated texture mapping similar to that found in Namco&#x27;s 1993 racing game &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;. Directed by &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; designer Seiichi Ishii, &quot;Tekken&quot; was intended to be a fundamentally similar title, with the addition of detailed textures that were not blocky on the characters like Virtua Fighter 2 and twice the frame rate. It was the first 3D fighting game to use the modern 60 fps standard.

==Gameplay==

As with many fighting games, players choose a character from a lineup and engage in hand-to-hand combat with an opponent. Traditional fighting games are usually played with buttons which correspond to the strength of the attack, such as strong punch or weak kick. &quot;Tekken&quot;, however, dedicates a button to each of the four limbs of the fighter. The gameplay system includes blocks, throws, escapes, and ground fighting.

In the original &quot;Tekken&quot;, players could only block attacks manually. From then on, starting with &quot;Tekken 2&quot;, characters automatically block while not moving forward or performing actions, a feature called &quot;neutral guard.&quot; Standing or retreating characters will block high and middle attacks with no input from the player, while crouching characters will duck high attacks and block low ones. Normal middle attacks will hit crouching players, but some special mid-attacks can be blocked by both stand and crouching neutral guards. Meanwhile, pressing backwards will give the player an &quot;active guard&quot; that can withstand certain combo attacks that would normally penetrate the neutral guard. Some characters are equipped with parries and reversals that act like traditional &quot;press button to block&quot; systems.

&quot;Tekken 3&quot; introduced several gameplay possibilities that were retained in later games, including the ability to sidestep into the foreground or background. &quot;Tekken 3&quot; and later games also reduced recovery time after being knocked down and gave characters rolls to recover instantly after hitting the ground, allowing the player to get back into the fight more quickly at the risk of being hit while rolling. 

&quot;Tekken 4&quot; was another leap, and gave characters even greater mobility by adding true 3D movement inside geometrically complex arenas with uneven ground, obstacles, and walls. The 3D gameplay allows damaging side and back throws as a reward for outmaneuvering the opponent, as well as evasive attacks that develop directly from a sidestep. &quot;Tekken 4&quot; received mixed feedback to the point of being considered by some as one of the worst installments in the series which led to major changes starting with &quot;Tekken 5&quot;. This was done thanks to the new engine provided by Namco. In retrospect, Harada believes &quot;Tekken 5&quot;, and &quot;Tekken 6&quot;, managed to attract a new group of fans, something &quot;Tekken 4&quot; did not largely do. However, the game has significantly grown in acclaim after some years due to its realism in gameplay and gritty story arcs. Harada has even improved his thoughts on the game and has gone on to call it the best game or peak in the series during an interview for the new Tekken 8. According to Harada, the innovation went &quot;the other way&quot; or reverted to more conservatism beginning Tekken 5. Much of the positive changes and reviews were not focused on in Tekken 4, and instead Harada focused only on the negative reviews against it, which in hindsight was not the proper way to make a fighting game starting with Tekken 5. Thus, he felt the game could have been even better, despite the eventual huge success upon its debut in late 2004. &quot;Tekken 5&quot; also saw a combination of walled and infinite arenas, while discarding uneven ground and terrain to allow more juggling. 

&quot;Tekken 6&quot; retains much of the design from &quot;Tekken 5&quot;, but it also includes a &quot;Rage&quot; mode, which activates when a character is near the end of his vitality bar and earns a damage multiplier. &quot;Bound&quot; (later known as &quot;Ground Bound&quot;) hits were also added, in which a player connected with an airborne opponent will place him in an inescapable grounded state, allowing combo extensions. &quot;Tekken 6&quot; also has destructible floors and walls that allow the fighters to blast through to new fighting areas when broken. &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament 2&quot; retains these elements while also adding a new kind of stage break (&quot;balcony breaks&quot;, which is a combination of floor and wall breaks where characters will go through a breakable wall and fall to a lower level in the same sequence). &quot;Tag 2&quot; specific features include Tag Assaults (cooperative combos triggered by hitting a Bound and a tag at the same time) and Tag Crashes (an emergency tag occurring when downed and the partner is currently in Rage).

&quot;Tekken 7&quot; introduces some movement changes to the &quot;Tekken&quot; formula. The back walk animation is now similar to &quot;Tekken Revolution&quot;, featuring a more fluid movement away from the opponent as opposed to a slower shuffle. Regular back rolling from a grounded state has been removed and instead replaced with new rising animation and performing an &quot;ankle kick&quot; (kicking the standing opponent while laying face up on the ground) is now accompanied by a new back roll to help create separation. Balcony breaks from &quot;Tag Tournament 2&quot; are present and function similarly to how they did in solo play. New features include &quot;Power Crushes&quot; (an attack that cannot be interrupted by regular attacks once the animation has begun) and &quot;Rage Arts&quot; (a super move attack that can only be used when your character has hit a Raged state near the end of their vitality meter, sacrificing the Rage mode to perform the attack). Bound has been mostly removed save for specific situations (certain moves can cause a Ground Bound if not combo-ed into and all low parries will cause a Ground Bound effect, similar to &quot;Tekken 6: Bloodline Rebellion&quot;; floor breaks now result in an effect similar to a Tag Assault in &quot;Tag 2&quot; rather than a standard Ground Bound) and instead, characters now have more frequent access to an &quot;Aerial Tailspin&quot; effect (an attack that throws an opponent backward onto their head as opposed to straight downwards, although it is still inescapable once triggered which means the combo can continue). Later &quot;Tekken 7&quot; updates eventually add &quot;Rage Drive&quot; (also cost Rage mode, and is an equivalent of EX and lower level super moves) as of &quot;Tekken 7: Fated Retribution&quot;, with the console ports&#x27; post-Season 1 adds two new damage properties which were originally existed in previous characters and still can only work against an opponent while they are on the ground. &quot;Tekken 7&quot; Season 2 adds &quot;Wall Bound&quot; mechanic, which bounces opponents from the wall to nearby them to an airborne state with a knockdown attack, originally used by both NANCY-MI847J in &quot;Tekken 6&quot; and a guest character Geese Howard prior to Season 2. However, currently, only a guest character Negan Smith can utilize Wall Bounce against an airborne opponent via one of his Rage Drives. The last update patch of &quot;Tekken 7&quot; Season 4 adds &quot;Wall Stun&quot;, which causes opponents to be bounced from the wall and entered a downed hit stun, whether they were being hit by or blocked their attacking opponents&#x27; attack.

&quot;Tekken 8&quot; introduced a new heat mode making the game oriented toward offensive play and creates more opportunities to turn the tide of a fight.

==Characters==

Players can choose from a diverse cast that hails from a variety of ethnic backgrounds and fighting styles. A few characters have supernatural origin, such as Devil, Alisa Bosconovitch, Angel, Mokujin, Ogre and Azazel, while animal characters like Kuma, Panda, the Roger family, and Alex provide comic relief. In the story mode of the game, each character generally has their own personal reasons for entering the tournament and competing for the prize.

The protagonist of the series has varied between installments; the character ending of each canon game determines the protagonist of each. Kazuya Mishima was the protagonist in the original game and &quot;Tekken 7&quot;, his father Heihachi Mishima was the protagonist of &quot;Tekken 2&quot;, and Jin Kazama has been one of the central protagonists since his debut in &quot;Tekken 3&quot; with Kazuya and Heihachi sharing the mantle in &quot;Tekken 7&quot;. The conflict between the Mishima family within multiple generations serves as the main conflict to the series&#x27; plot or at least the Mishima saga according to Katsuhiro Harada, who describes it as a simple struggle of the three men aiming to destroy one another and the devil gene. Although Lars Alexandersson among other characters are not fully related to them, they serve as major characters within &quot;Tekken 6&quot; where Jin serves as the main antagonist instead of his relatives.

Characters with background connections in the story typically have styles or moves in common. For example, Heihachi and Kazuya Mishima, by virtues of familial connection and studying under the same Advanced Mishima Style Fighting Karate discipline, have very similar moves and a signature &quot;crouch dash&quot; stance for pretty much their entire appearances in the series. Jin Kazama, when he debuted, also had the same Mishima fighting style, though he mixed this with Kazama Style Traditional Martial Arts as practiced by his mother, Jun Kazama. For storyline reasons, starting on &quot;Tekken 4&quot;, he forwent this in favor of Traditional Karate, a completely different discipline that technically made him an entirely different character, while his old movelist was given to his demonic form, Devil Jin. Meanwhile, there are some characters who were formerly clones of each other before they diverged and gained unique moves, such as Lee Chaolan (a clone of Marshall Law), Anna Williams (a clone of her sister, Nina), and Armor King (a clone of King). Still further, there are also characters who are replacements or &quot;successors&quot; of older characters; this happened principally in &quot;Tekken 3&quot; due to the significant time skip, though some older characters later returned alongside their successors anyway. Examples include Julia Chang (replacing her adoptive mother, Michelle), Hwoarang (replacing his mentor, Baek Doo San, who later returned) and as mentioned above, Jin Kazama (replacing both of his parents, Kazuya and Jun, the former of whom later returned, while the latter was replaced by Asuka Kazama). Another example of two characters sharing a moveset can be seen with Eddy Gordo, a Brazilian representing the dance fighting martial art known as Capoeira. He shares these dance fighting moves with his mentee, Christie Monteiro.

Some &quot;Tekken&quot; characters have been featured as guest characters in other video games, such as &quot;Anna Kournikova&#x27;s Smash Court Tennis&quot;, &quot;Digimon World Re:Digitize&quot;, &quot;Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2&quot;, &quot;Pac-Man Fever&quot;, &quot;PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale&quot;, &quot;Ridge Racer 6&quot;, &quot;Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament 2&quot;, &quot;Soulcalibur II&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, &quot;Brawlhalla&quot;, and &quot;Urban Reign&quot;, as well as in some crossover role-playing video games, including &quot;Cross Edge&quot;, &quot;Namco × Capcom&quot;, &quot;Project X Zone&quot;, &quot;Project X Zone 2&quot;, &quot;Queen&#x27;s Gate: Spiral Chaos&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters All Star&quot;.

==Adaptations==

===Other media===
There have been five printed adaptations of the &quot;Tekken&quot; games. Knightstone Comics published both &quot;Tekken Saga&quot; and &quot;Tekken 2&quot;, released in October 1997 and September 1998 respectively. Both comics were written by John Kim and illustrated by Walter McDaniel. &quot;Tekken Forever&quot;, a comic book by Dave Chi, illustrated by Paco Diaz, and published by Image Comics in December 2001, features a story that focused on the Kazama family and also the Unknown character from &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament&quot;. is a manga written by Keiichi Suzuki and published by Shogakukan, which was collected in two tankōbon volumes with the first one on December 5, 2000, and the second one on April 5, 2001. &quot;Tekken Comic&quot; is a manga illustrated by Rui Takato and published by Ultra Egg Jump in 2009. Although the story leads up to the King of Iron Fist Tournament 6, it is non-canonical to the main video game series. In October 2016, Titan Comics announced a new &quot;Tekken&quot; comic book, a four-issue mini-series by Cavan Scott, illustrated by Andie Tong, and published in mid-2017. The series takes place between &quot;Tekken 6&quot; and &quot;7&quot;, and deals with Jin struggling against the Devil within him.

Characters and settings from the series also appear in the collectible card game &quot;Universal Fighting System&quot; by Fantasy Flight Games and in &quot;Epic Battles&quot; by Score Entertainment.

==Reception==
Critical reception to the games has been positive, with the series arguably peaking with the release of &quot;Tekken 3&quot; that received an average of 96% at Metacritic and GameRankings, and to this day considered one of the greatest fighting games of all time. Other candidate games have been &quot;Tekken 2&quot;, &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament&quot;, and &quot;Tekken 8&quot;.

In 1999, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed the &quot;Tekken&quot; series as number 12 on their &quot;Top 50 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting that, &quot;In the transition from 16-bit to 32-bit, &quot;Tekken&quot; stole the crown from &quot;Street Fighter&quot; as the king of modern brawlers with addictive fighting in its rawest form.&quot;

Developers of non-&quot;Tekken&quot; games have commented on the series in various ways. Ed Boon, the co-creator of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, revealed in one of his interviews with &quot;GamePro&quot; that his favorite fighting game out of his competitors is &quot;Tekken&quot;. Both Sega and Namco have shown interest in a possible crossover between &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; and &quot;Tekken&quot;, which came in the form of &quot;Project X Zone&quot; and its sequel for the 3DS. &quot;Tekken&quot; is known to have been heavily inspired by &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; and the series has often been labelled as a &quot;rival&quot; to &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; as they became two of the most famous 3D fighting game series along with &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; and &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;. On the other hand, Tomonobu Itagaki, designer of the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; series, expressed dislike for the &quot;Tekken&quot; franchise due to Namco running radio commercial ads insulting his &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; series, prompting Itagaki to place it as one of his most disliked games.

In 2004&#x27;s &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;, characters Pete, Shaun, and Ed &quot;stayed up all night, drinking apple schnapps and playing &quot;Tekken 2&quot;.&quot; &quot;Tekken 3&quot; is considered one of the greatest games of all time.

In 2012, &quot;Complex&quot; ranked &quot;Tekken&quot; at number 11 on the list of the best video game franchises, commenting: &quot;Just when we thought that the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; franchise was going to be the epitome of fighting games, &quot;Tekken&quot; came to make it share its portion of the knuckle-busting pie. &quot;Tekken&quot; has cult-like fans who live and breathe the moves and storylines.&quot;

===Sales===
As of March 2023, the &quot;Tekken&quot; franchise had sold over 58 million copies worldwide. &quot;Tekken 7&quot; is the highest-selling game in the franchise, selling over copies .

==Legacy==
Since the series has a long history of being exclusive to PlayStation along with the arcade cabinets running on PlayStation hardware, &quot;Tekken&quot; has been associated closely with the PlayStation brand. Katsuhiro Harada has stated that PlayStation remains the main platform of development for &quot;Tekken&quot;.

The first game in the series was the first PlayStation game to sell over a million units, which earned it a &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; award in 2008, among other awards including &quot;First Fighting Game To Feature Simulated 3D&quot;, and a record for the entire series, &quot;The Best Selling Fighting Series for PlayStation Consoles.&quot; &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament&quot; was one of the most popular launch titles for the PlayStation 2.

Another game developed by Namco, &quot;Soulcalibur II&quot;, included exclusive characters for different console versions and featured Heihachi Mishima, a character that has been in all &quot;Tekken&quot; games and the protagonist of &quot;Tekken 2&quot;, exclusive to the PlayStation 2 version. He was also playable in &quot;PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale&quot; and is Harada&#x27;s favorite character in the series.

&quot;Tekken 7&quot;″s PlayStation 4 announcement trailer featured a retrospective celebration of &quot;20 Years of &quot;Tekken&quot;&quot;, and the PlayStation 4 version of the game features exclusive content from previous titles in the series, including character costumes and musical tracks. The PlayStation 4 version was the best selling version of the game, and provided a 6% boost in hardware sales in Japan. While PlayStation Classic was not well received by the public, &quot;Tekken 3&quot; was included in the preloaded collection. &quot;Tekken 3&quot; is also available in all regions.

&quot;Astro&#x27;s Playroom&quot;, a 2020 video game released as a launch title for PlayStation 5, included a homage to the &quot;Tekken&quot; series. The inclusion was supervised by Harada as well. The successor, 2024&#x27;s &quot;Astro Bot&quot;, also including a reference to &quot;Tekken&quot;. Closed network testing of &quot;Tekken 8&quot; was available first exclusively to PlayStation 5, as well as a demo. While Windows became the most popular platform for &quot;Tekken 8&quot;, sales on the PlayStation 5 version were significantly higher than the Xbox SeriesX/S&#x27;s.

In May 2012, Namco Bandai opened Tekken Museum in Osaka, Japan. The museum showcases goods, action figures, artworks, life-size statues of &quot;Tekken&quot; characters, and various merchandise. The items on display are rotated regularly so that the museum is worth multiple visits.

<text>Gifford Pinchot (August 11, 1865October 4, 1946) was an American forester and politician. He served as the fourth chief of the U.S. Division of Forestry, as the first head of the United States Forest Service, and as the 28th governor of Pennsylvania. He was a member of the Republican Party for most of his life, though he joined the Progressive Party for a brief period.

Born into the wealthy Pinchot family, Gifford Pinchot embarked on a career in forestry after graduating from Yale University in 1889. President William McKinley appointed Pinchot as the head of the Division of Forestry in 1898, and Pinchot became the first chief of the U.S. Forest Service after it was established in 1905. Pinchot enjoyed a close relationship with President Theodore Roosevelt, who shared Pinchot&#x27;s views regarding the importance of conservation. After William Howard Taft succeeded Roosevelt as president, Pinchot was at the center of the Pinchot–Ballinger controversy, a dispute with Secretary of the Interior Richard A. Ballinger that led to Pinchot&#x27;s dismissal. The controversy contributed to the split of the Republican Party and the formation of the Progressive Party prior to the 1912 presidential election. Pinchot supported Roosevelt&#x27;s Progressive candidacy, but Roosevelt was defeated by Democrat Woodrow Wilson.

Pinchot returned to public office in 1920, becoming the head of the Pennsylvania&#x27;s forestry division under Governor William Cameron Sproul. He succeeded Sproul by winning the 1922 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election. He won a second term as governor through a victory in the 1930 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, and supported many of the New Deal policies of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. After the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment, Pinchot led the establishment of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, calling it &quot;the best liquor control system in America&quot;. He retired from public life after his defeat in the 1938 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, but remained active in the conservation movement until his death in 1946.

Gifford Pinchot was born in Simsbury, Connecticut, on August 11, 1865. He was named for Hudson River School artist Sanford Robinson Gifford. Pinchot was the oldest child of James W. Pinchot, a successful New York City interior furnishings merchant, and Mary Eno, daughter of one of New York City&#x27;s wealthiest real estate developers, Amos Eno. James and Mary were both well-connected with prominent Republican Party leaders and former Union generals, including family friend William T. Sherman, and they would frequently aid Pinchot&#x27;s later political career. Pinchot&#x27;s paternal grandfather had migrated from France to the United States in 1816, becoming a merchant and major landowner based in Milford, Pennsylvania. His mother&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Elisha Phelps, and her uncle, John S. Phelps, both served in Congress. Pinchot had one younger brother, Amos, and one younger sister, Antoinette, who later married British diplomat Alan Johnstone.

Pinchot was educated at home until 1881, when he enrolled in Phillips Exeter Academy. James made conservation a family affair and suggested that Gifford should become a forester, asking him just before he left for Yale in 1885, &quot;How would you like to become a forester?&quot; At Yale, Pinchot became a member of the Skull and Bones society, played on the football team under coach Walter Camp, and volunteered with the YMCA. Pinchot earned a varsity letter and scored two touchdowns as a member of the national champion 1888 Yale football team, which was undefeated and was not scored on.

With the encouragement of his parents, Pinchot continued to pursue the nascent field of forestry after graduating from Yale in 1889. He traveled to Europe, where he met with leading European foresters such as Dietrich Brandis and Wilhelm Philipp Daniel Schlich, who suggested that Pinchot study the French forestry system. Brandis and Schlich had a strong influence on Pinchot, who would later rely heavily upon Brandis&#x27; advice in introducing professional forest management in the U.S. Pinchot studied at the French National School of Forestry in Nancy. This is where his formal studies took place, and where he learned the basics of forest economics, law, and science. It was also where he first encountered a professionally managed forest, where, &quot;[The French Forests] were divided at regular intervals by perfectly straight paths and roads at right angle to each other, and they were protected to a degree we in America know nothing about.&quot; Pinchot returned to America after thirteen months before completing his curriculum and against the advice of his professors. Pinchot felt that additional training was unnecessary and what mattered was getting the profession of forestry started in America.

== Early career, 1890–1910 ==
===Early roles===

Pinchot landed his first professional forestry position in early 1892, when he became the manager of the forests at George Washington Vanderbilt II&#x27;s Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina. The following year, Pinchot met John Muir, a naturalist who founded the Sierra Club and would become Pinchot&#x27;s mentor and, later, his rival. Pinchot worked at Biltmore until 1895, when he fell out with Carl Alwin Schenck and opened a consulting office in New York City. In 1896, he embarked on a tour of the American West with the National Forest Commission. Pinchot disagreed with the commission&#x27;s final report, which advocated preventing U.S. forest reserves from being used for any commercial purpose; Pinchot instead favored the development of a professional forestry service which would preside over limited commercial activities in forest reserves. In 1897, Pinchot became a special forest agent for the United States Department of the Interior.

===Lead forester===

====Head of the Division of Forestry====
In 1898, Pinchot became the head of the Division of Forestry, which was part of the United States Department of Agriculture. Pinchot is known for reforming the management and development of forests in the United States and for advocating the conservation of the nation&#x27;s reserves by planned use and renewal. His approach set him apart from some other leading forestry experts, especially Bernhard E. Fernow and Carl A. Schenck. In contrast to Pinchot&#x27;s national vision, Fernow advocated a regional approach, while Schenck favored private enterprise effort. Pinchot&#x27;s main contribution was his leadership in promoting scientific forestry and emphasizing the controlled, profitable use of forests and other natural resources so they would be of maximum benefit to mankind. He coined the term conservation ethic as applied to natural resources. Under his leadership, the number of individuals employed by the Division of Forestry grew from 60 in 1898 to 500 in 1905; he also hired numerous part-time employees who worked only during the summer. The Division of Forestry did not have direct control over the national forest reserves, which were instead assigned to the U.S. Department of Interior, but Pinchot reached an arrangement with the Department of Interior and state agencies to work on reserves.

In 1900, Pinchot established the Society of American Foresters, an organization that helped bring credibility to the new profession of forestry, and was part of the broader professionalization movement underway in the United States at the turn of the twentieth century. Pursuant to the goal of professionalization, the Pinchot family endowed a 2-year graduate-level School of Forestry at Yale University, which is now known as the Forest School at the Yale School of the Environment. It became the third school in the U.S. that trained professional foresters, after the New York State College of Forestry at Cornell and the Biltmore Forest School. Central to his publicity work was his creation of news for magazines and newspapers.

====Chief of the United States Forest Service====

Pinchot&#x27;s friend, Theodore Roosevelt, became president in 1901, and Pinchot became part of the latter&#x27;s informal &quot;Tennis Cabinet&quot;. Pinchot and Roosevelt shared the view that the federal government must act to regulate public lands and provide for the scientific management of public resources. In 1905, Roosevelt and Pinchot convinced Congress to establish the United States Forest Service, an agency charged with overseeing the country&#x27;s forest reserves. As the first head of the Forest Service, Pinchot implemented a decentralized structure that empowered local civil servants to make decisions about conservation and forestry.

Pinchot&#x27;s conservation philosophy was influenced by ethnologist William John McGee and utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham, as well as the ethos of the Progressive Era. Like many other Progressive Era reformers, Pinchot emphasized that his field was important primarily for its social utility and could be best understood through scientific methods. He was generally opposed to preservation for the sake of wilderness or scenery, a fact perhaps best illustrated by the important support he offered to the damming of Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park. Pinchot used the rhetoric of the market economy to disarm critics of efforts to expand the role of government: scientific management of forests and natural resources was profitable. While most of his battles were with timber companies that he thought had too narrow a time horizon, he also battled the forest preservationists like John Muir, who were deeply opposed to commercializing nature. Pinchot&#x27;s policies also aroused opposition from ranchers, who opposed regulation of livestock grazing in public lands.

The Roosevelt administration&#x27;s efforts to regulate public land led to blowback in Congress, which moved to combat &quot;Pinchotism&quot; and reassert control over the Forest Service. In 1907, Congress passed an act prohibiting the president from creating more forest reserves. With Pinchot&#x27;s help, President Roosevelt responded by creating 16 million acres (65,000 km²) of new National Forests (which became known as &quot;midnight forests&quot;) just minutes before he lost the legal power to do so. Despite congressional opposition, Roosevelt, Pinchot, and Secretary of the Interior James R. Garfield continued to find ways to protect public land from private development during Roosevelt&#x27;s last two years in office.
Pinchot hand-picked William Greeley, the son of a Congregational minister, who finished at the top of that first Yale forestry graduating class of 1904, to be the Forest Service&#x27;s Region 1 forester, with responsibility over 41 million acres (170,000 km2) in 22 National Forests in four western states (all of Montana, much of Idaho, Washington, and a corner of South Dakota).[3]

====Fire Storm of 1910 and the descent of the Forest Service====
One year after the Great Fire of 1910, the religious Greeley succeeded in receiving a promotion to a high administration job in Washington. In 1920, he became Chief of the Forest Service. The fire of 1910 convinced him that Satan was at work, the fire converted him into a fire extinguishing partisan who elevated firefighting to the raison d&#x27;être — the overriding mission — of the Forest Service.[3] Under Greeley, the Service became the fire engine company, protecting trees so the timber industry could cut them down later at government expense. Pinchot was appalled. The timber industry successfully oriented the Forestry Service toward policies favorable to large-scale harvesting via regulatory capture, and metaphorically, the timber industry was now the fox in the chicken coop.[25] Pinchot and Roosevelt had envisioned, at the least, that public timber should be sold only to small, family-run logging outfits, not to big syndicates. Pinchot had always preached of a &quot;working forest&quot; for working people and small-scale logging at the edge, preservation at the core. In 1928 Bill Greeley left the Forest Service for a position in the timber industry, becoming an executive with the West Coast Lumberman&#x27;s Association.[26]

When Pinchot traveled west in 1937, to view those forests with Henry S. Graves, what they saw &quot;tore his heart out&quot;. Greeley&#x27;s legacy, combining modern chain saws and government-built forest roads, had allowed industrial-scale clear-cuts to become the norm in the western national forests of Montana and Oregon. Entire mountainsides, mountain after mountain, were treeless. &quot;So this is what saving the trees was all about.&quot; &quot;Absolute devastation&quot;, Pinchot wrote in his diary. &quot;The Forest Service should absolutely declare against clear-cutting in Washington and Oregon as a defensive measure&quot;, Pinchot wrote.[27]

==== Pinchot–Ballinger controversy ====

Pinchot continued to lead the Forest Service after Republican William Howard Taft succeeded Roosevelt in 1909, but did not retain the level of influence he had held under Roosevelt. Taft mistrusted Pinchot and did not have patience for Pinchot operating with more authority than what Taft thought was appropriate. Taft once stated, &quot;Pinchot is a socialist and a spiritualist, a strange combination and one that is capable of any extreme act.&quot; After taking office, Taft replaced Secretary of the Interior James Rudolph Garfield with Richard Ballinger. The tension between Ballinger and Taft on the one hand and their predecessors Pinchot and Roosevelt on the other lay less in any differing level of commitment to conservation than in differing scruples over legality, a contrast summed up by Senator Francis G. Newlands of Nevada:There is no real difference of opinion between those who believe with Mr. Ballinger and those who believe with Mr. Pinchot regarding the legislation which should be enacted as to the conservation of our natural resources. The difference which exists between them is as to the authority of law. Mr. Garfield... and Mr. Pinchot have both taken the view that the Executive Department, as the custodian of the great public domain, &quot;can do anything that is necessary for the protection and conservation of that domain which is not forbidden by law&quot;. ... I propose now to state the position of Mr. Ballinger — it is that in the protection and conservation of the public domain the Interior Department, or the Executive Department, &quot;has only those powers expressly authorized by law&quot;.

When Ballinger approved of long-disputed mining claims to coal deposits in Alaska in 1909, Land Office agent Louis Glavis broke governmental protocol by going outside the Interior Department to seek help from Pinchot. Concerned about the possibility of fraud in the claim, and skeptical of Ballinger&#x27;s commitment to conservation, Pinchot intervened in the dispute on behalf of Glavis. In the midst of a budding controversy, Taft came down in favor of Ballinger, who was authorized to dismiss Glavis. Though Taft hoped to avoid further controversy, Pinchot became determined to dramatize the issue by forcing his own dismissal. After Pinchot publicly criticized Ballinger for several months, Taft dismissed Pinchot in January 1910. Pinchot maneuvered behind the scenes to ensure the appointment of his ally, Henry S. Graves, as the new head of the Forest Service. An investigation two decades later by Harold L. Ickes, Secretary of the Interior under Franklin Roosevelt, led Ickes to conclude that Pinchot&#x27;s allegations against Ballinger were unfounded and that Pinchot&#x27;s motive for making them was an appetite for publicity.

== Political career, 1910–1935 ==

=== Progressive Party ===
At Roosevelt&#x27;s request, Pinchot met Roosevelt in Europe in 1910, where they discussed Pinchot&#x27;s dismissal by Taft. Roosevelt subsequently expressed disappointment with Taft&#x27;s policies and began to publicly distance himself from Taft. Along with Amos Pinchot and several other individuals, Pinchot helped establish the Progressive Party, which nominated Roosevelt for president in the 1912 United States presidential election. The Pinchots represented the more ideologically left wing faction of the party, and they frequently feuded with financier George Walbridge Perkins. Though Pinchot campaigned extensively for Roosevelt, Roosevelt and Taft were both defeated by Democrat Woodrow Wilson.

Pinchot continued to affiliate with the Progressives after the 1912 election, working to build the party in Pennsylvania. He ran as the Progressive nominee in the 1914 U.S. Senate election, but was defeated by incumbent Republican Senator Boies Penrose. The Progressive Party collapsed after Roosevelt refused to run in the 1916 presidential election, and Pinchot subsequently re-joined the Republican Party. He supported Republican Warren G. Harding&#x27;s successful campaign in the 1920 presidential election, but, despite some speculation that he would be appointed as Secretary of Agriculture, did not receive a position in Harding&#x27;s administration.

=== Continued Conservation ===
After leaving office in 1910, Pinchot took up leadership of the National Conservation Association (NCA), a conservationist non-governmental organization that he had helped found the previous year. The organization, which ceased operations in 1923, never attracted as many members as Pinchot had initially hoped, but its efforts affected conservation-related legislation. Later in the 1920s, Pinchot worked with Senator George W. Norris to build a federal dam on the Tennessee River.

Pinchot had appointed William Greeley during his tenure at the Forest Service, and Greeley became chief of the Forest Service in 1920. Under Greeley, the forest service became a figurative fire engine company, protecting trees so the timber industry could cut them down later at government expense. Pinchot had always preached of a &quot;working forest&quot; in which working people would engage in small-scale logging, while the forests would be preserved, and he was appalled by the large-scale logging undertaken by large syndicates. Pinchot had a more favorable view of Greeley&#x27;s successor, Robert Y. Stuart, and his influence played a key role in blocking several plans to transfer of the Forest Service out of the Department of Agriculture.
=== First term as Governor of Pennsylvania ===
Governor William Cameron Sproul appointed Pinchot as chairman of the Pennsylvania Forest Commission in 1920. As chairman, Pinchot coaxed a major budget increase from the legislature, decentralized the commission&#x27;s administration, and replaced numerous political appointees with professional foresters. He narrowly won the three-candidate Republican primary in Pennsylvania&#x27;s 1922 gubernatorial election, and went on to defeat Democrat John A. McSparran in the general election. Pinchot&#x27;s victory over his Republican opponents owed much to his reputation as a staunch teetotaler during the early period of Prohibition; he was also boosted by his popularity with farmers, laborers, and women. Pinchot focused on balancing the state budget; he inherited a $32 million deficit and left office with a $6.7 million surplus. Pinchot and engineer Morris Llewellyn Cooke pursued ambitious plans to regulate Pennsylvania&#x27;s electric power industry, but their proposals were defeated in the state legislature.

Pinchot emerged as a potential contender for the Republican nomination in the 1924 presidential election following the death of President Harding, as many progressive Republicans hoped Pinchot could unseat Harding&#x27;s successor, Calvin Coolidge. Pinchot&#x27;s presidential chances were badly damaged by his role in settling the 1923 United Mine Workers coal strike, as he received the blame for a subsequent increase in coal prices, and Coolidge ultimately won the 1924 presidential election. Constitutionally barred from seeking a second term, Pinchot ran in the 1926 Senate election in Pennsylvania. Facing strong opposition from anti-Prohibition &quot;wets&quot; and the conservative wing of the Republican Party, Pinchot was defeated by Congressman William Scott Vare in the Republican primary. Vare went on to defeat former Labor Secretary William Wilson in the general election, but in his capacity as governor Pinchot refused to certify the results of the election, claiming that Vare had illegally bought votes. The U.S. Senate refused to seat Vare and the seat was not filled until the appointment of Joseph R. Grundy in 1929.

===Second term as governor===
With the backing of Senator Grundy, Pinchot launched a bid for the Republican nomination in the 1930 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election. Relying once again on support from women and rural voters, Pinchot defeated Francis Shunk Brown, the candidate of Vare&#x27;s Philadelphia machine, and Thomas Phillips, a former US Representative who was enthusiastically supported by the state&#x27;s wet forces. Despite the defection of some Republicans, Pinchot narrowly defeated Democrat John Hemphill in the general election. Taking office in the midst of the Great Depression, Pinchot faced persistently high unemployment levels and sharply declining revenues during his second term.

Pinchot prioritized fiscal conservatism and avoided major budget increases, but he also sought ways to help the impoverished and unemployed. He presided over the passage of a bill to provide state money for indigent care and initiated various infrastructure projects. He cooperated with President Franklin Roosevelt, despite Roosevelt&#x27;s being a Democrat and Prohibition opponent. Under Governor Pinchot&#x27;s leadership, Pennsylvania welcomed the Civilian Conservation Corps, which established 113 camps to work on public lands in Pennsylvania (second only to California). Working with the Works Progress Administration and National Park Service, Pinchot helped expand Pennsylvania&#x27;s state parks, and also helped Pennsylvania&#x27;s struggling farmers and unemployed workers by paving rural roads, which became known as &quot;Pinchot Roads&quot;.

Prohibition was repealed in 1933. Four days before the sale of alcohol became legal in Pennsylvania again, Pinchot called the Pennsylvania General Assembly into special session to debate regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of alcohol. This session led to the establishment of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board and its system of state-run liquor stores. Though Pinchot is often misquoted as having said his goal was to &quot;discourage the purchase of alcoholic beverages by making it as inconvenient and expensive as possible&quot;, in reality he believed that the PLCB would put bootleggers out of business by offering lower prices. Pinchot also argued that under the new system of state controlled liquor stores &quot;[w]hisky will be sold by civil service employees with exactly the same amount of salesmanship as is displayed by an automatic postage stamp vending machine.&quot;

===Eugenics===
Pinchot was a delegate to the first and second International Eugenics Congress, in 1912 and 1921, and a member of the advisory council of the American Eugenics Society, from 1925 to 1935.

== Final years ==
Pinchot ran unsuccessfully for the Senate a third time in the 1934 Senate election in Pennsylvania, losing the Republican nomination to incumbent Senator David A. Reed. He later sought the Republican nomination in the 1938 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, running on a platform that favored the New Deal and opposed the influence of Republican leaders Joseph R. Grundy and Joseph N. Pew Jr. He was defeated in the Republican primary by conservative former Lieutenant Governor Arthur James.

Out of public office, Pinchot continued his ultimately successful campaign to prevent the transfer of the Forest Service to the Department of the Interior, frequently sparring with Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes. He also published new editions of his manual on forestry and worked on his autobiography, &quot;Breaking New Ground&quot;, which was published shortly after his death. During and after World War II, Pinchot advocated for conservation to be a part of the mission of the United Nations, but the United Nations would not focus on the environment until the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment.

=== Death ===
Gifford Pinchot died on October 4, 1946, aged 81, from leukemia. He is interred at Milford Cemetery, Pike County, Pennsylvania.

==Personal life==

Pinchot fell in love with Laura Houghteling, the daughter of a wealthy Chicago lumberman, in Asheville, North Carolina. Pinchot was managing the forest assets of the Biltmore estate, while Houghteling stayed at her family estate Strawberry Hill on the French Broad River. In 1893, they decided to marry, but Laura passed away in early 1894 after a protracted battle with tuberculosis. Gifford Pinchot wore black mourning clothes in the following years, wrote about Houghteling often in his journal, and would not marry for another 20 years. During the 1912 presidential campaign, Pinchot frequently worked with Cornelia Bryce, a women&#x27;s suffrage activist who was a daughter of former Congressman Lloyd Bryce and a granddaughter of former New York City mayor Edward Cooper. They became engaged in early 1914 and were married in August 1914. Although Cornelia Pinchot waged several unsuccessful campaigns for the United States House of Representatives, she was successful with numerous other political and public service activities, and has been described by historians at the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission as &quot;one of the most politically active first ladies in the history of Pennsylvania&quot;. She gave numerous speeches on behalf of women, organized labor, and other causes, and frequently served as a campaign surrogate for her husband. Pinchot and his family took a seven-month voyage of the Southern Pacific Ocean in 1929, which Pinchot chronicled in his 1930 work, &quot;To the South Seas&quot;.

Pinchot and his wife had one child, Gifford Bryce Pinchot, who was born in 1915. The younger Pinchot later helped found the Natural Resources Defense Council, an organization similar to his father&#x27;s National Conservation Association. Proud of the first Gifford Pinchot&#x27;s legacy, the family has continued to name their sons Gifford, down to Gifford Pinchot IV.

==Legacy==
Gifford Pinchot was a highly important figure in the history of conservation and natural resource management in the United States. Here are some key reasons for his significance: Pinchot was instrumental in President Roosevelt&#x27;s establishment of the United States Forest Service in 1905. As the first Chief of the Forest Service, he played a key role in shaping the agency&#x27;s mission and policies, emphasizing sustainable management of forest resources for the benefit of the public. Pinchot was a highly visible organizer and writer in the conservation movement of the early 20th century. A master politician, he advocated for the wise use and preservation of natural resources, promoting the idea of conservation as a means to ensure long-term benefits for society. Pinchot was fired by President Taft, and this was a major factor in the alienation of Taft and Roosevelt in 1912. 

Pinchot developed the concept of multiple-use management, which advocated for balancing conservation with the utilization of natural resources for economic and social purposes. This principle continues to influence conservation practices today. Pinchot&#x27;s advocacy and expertise helped shape significant conservation policies and legislation during his time, including the establishment of national forests, the Antiquities Act, and the National Park Service. On conservation matters he was a major influence on President Theodore Roosevelt. Pinchot&#x27;s ideas and legacy have had a lasting impact on conservation practices in the United States and beyond. His emphasis on sustainable resource management and the public interest continues to be relevant in contemporary conservation efforts.

===Memorials===
Gifford Pinchot National Forest in Washington and Gifford Pinchot State Park in Lewisberry, Pennsylvania, are named in his honor, as is Pinchot Hall at Penn State University. A large Coast Redwood in Muir Woods, California, is also named in his honor, as are Mount Pinchot and Pinchot Pass near the John Muir Trail in Kings Canyon National Park in the Sierra Nevada in California. The Pinchot Sycamore, the largest tree in his native state of Connecticut and second-largest sycamore on the Atlantic coast, still stands in Simsbury. The house where Pinchot was born belonged to his grandfather, Captain Elisha Phelps, and is also on the National Register of Historic Places. He is also commemorated in the scientific name of a species of Caribbean lizard, &quot;Anolis pinchoti&quot;. In 1963, President John F. Kennedy accepted the family&#x27;s summer retreat house, Grey Towers National Historic Site, which the Pinchot family donated to the U.S. Forest Service. It remains the only National Historic Landmark operated by that federal agency. The street address of the USDA&#x27;s Forest Products Laboratory headquarters in Madison, Wisconsin is 1 Gifford Pinchot Drive.

Gifford Pinchot III, grandson of the first Gifford Pinchot, founded the Pinchot University, now merged with Presidio Graduate School. The Pinchot family also dedicated The Pinchot Institute for Conservation, which maintains offices both at Grey Towers and headquarters in Washington, D.C. The Institute continues Pinchot&#x27;s legacy of conservation leadership and sustainable forestry.

<text>Richard Charles Blum (July 31, 1935 – February 27, 2022) was an American investor and the husband of United States Senator Dianne Feinstein. He was the chairman and president of Blum Capital, an equity investment management firm. Blum was on the boards of directors of several companies, including CB Richard Ellis, where until May 2009 he served as the chairman of that board. He was a regent of the University of California from 2002 until his death.

== Early life ==
Blum was born in San Francisco, California, to a Jewish family. He was the son of Louise (Hirsch) and Herbert Blum, who sold robes and raincoats. He attended San Francisco public schools. He received his Bachelor of Science in business administration in 1958 and a Master of Business Administration in 1959 from the Haas School of Business of the University of California, Berkeley.

In the 1970s, Blum supported then Mayor of San Francisco George Moscone. After Moscone&#x27;s assassination, Blum supported the new mayor Dianne Feinstein; they married in 1980. Blum had three daughters from his first marriage to Andrea Schwartz Blum.

== Career ==

Blum joined investment brokerage Sutro &amp; Co. at the age of 23, becoming a partner before age 30. At Sutro, Blum led a partnership that acquired Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus for $8 million, selling it to Mattel four years later for $40 million. On the back of this deal Blum started in business for himself in 1975, founding what is now Blum Capital Partners; a stake in URS Corp. was one of its first investments.

Blum founded Blum Capital in 1975. Blum previously served as chairman of the board of directors of CB Richard Ellis, as well as serving as director on the boards of directors of three other portfolio companies: Fairmont Raffles Holdings International Ltd., Current Media, L.L.C., and Myer Pty Ltd. in Australia. Blum co-founded Newbridge Capital in 1994.

Blum served on the boards of multiple companies, including Northwest Airlines Corporation, Glenborough Realty Trust, Inc., Korea First Bank, URS Corporation, and National Education Corporation. Blum was the founder and chairman of the American Himalayan Foundation and was Honorary Consul to Mongolia and Nepal. Blum was also a member of the advisory board of Berkeley&#x27;s Haas School of Business.

On March 12, 2002, Blum was appointed by California Governor Gray Davis to a 12-year term as one of the Regents of the University of California. He was reappointed to another 12-year term in 2014 by Governor Jerry Brown.

On April 25, 2009, at a talk featuring the 14th Dalai Lama, Berkeley Chancellor Robert Birgenau presented Blum with the Berkeley Medal, the university&#x27;s top honor. The talk was sponsored by his American Himalayan Foundation and the Blum Center for Developing Economies at Berkeley.

Blum was also the primary owner of Career Education Corporation until 2015 and served on the boards of the CB Richard Ellis (chairman), Newbridge Capital (co-chairman), and Blum Capital.

== Personal life ==
Blum had a strong interest in Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism, and in 1981 he attempted to climb Mount Everest from the Tibetan side with Sir Edmund Hillary. He was the chairman and founder of the apolitical American Himalayan Foundation (AHF), which has given millions of dollars to build hospitals and schools in Tibet and Nepal, but refrained from political involvement with the Chinese control of Tibet.

Blum was at various times a trustee of The Carter Center; co-chairman of The World Conference of Religions for Peace; member of Governing Council of The Wilderness Society; member of the board of trustees of the Brookings Institution; member of the board of trustees of the American Cancer Society Foundation; member of the board of directors of the National Democratic Institute; and a member of the board of trustees of the Richard C. Blum Center for Developing Economies at the University of California, Berkeley. He contributed $15 million toward the establishment of the center, which addresses extreme poverty and disease in the developing world. In 2019, Blum provided an additional $12 million to endow a chair at the center.

He donated to the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), Merced and Los Angeles (UCLA) and Sonoma State University, as well as Macalester College. He pledged $1.25 million to the University of San Francisco (USF) in 2007, and another $1.5 million to USF for &quot;global education&quot; in 2019. He was awarded the UCSF medal in 2012. He served on many other boards, including the Seva Foundation and as chairman of the Himalayan Foundation. In the arts and culture, he made grants to the Creative Visions Foundation, the Daniel Pearl Foundation, San Francisco&#x27;s Asian Art Museum, the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, and the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles.

Blum was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2016. He was hospitalized in September 2021 for an undisclosed reason. He died from cancer at his home in San Francisco on February 27, 2022, at the age of 86.

=== Controversy ===

Blum&#x27;s wife, US Senator Dianne Feinstein, was criticized over Blum&#x27;s government contracts and business dealings with the People&#x27;s Republic of China and her past votes on trade agreements with that country. Blum denied any wrongdoing. 

Blum and Feinstein were also criticized for having a 75% stake in Tutor Perini, a building contractor which received military contracts for projects in Iraq and Afghanistan during the U.S. occupation of those countries. 

In 2008, during the sub-prime mortgage crisis, Feinstein contacted the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation with a proposal to fund the FDIC&#x27;s foreclosed-property dealings through the US government&#x27;s general budget. Not long afterward, Blum&#x27;s real estate firm, CB Richard Ellis, won a lucrative contract with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to sell foreclosed properties.

In 2020, Blum was discovered to have written letters on behalf of unqualified applicants to various UC campus chancellors. The applicants were admitted through student athletics programs, even though, according to a state audit “they possessed little athletic talent.” The audit described Blum&#x27;s actions as &quot;particularly problematic&quot; as University Regents should not influence admissions decisions.

<doc id="224692" wikidata="Q105206" url="?curid=224692" title="Bukovina">
<text>Bukovina is a historical region at the crossroads of Central and Eastern Europe. The region is located on the northern slopes of the central Eastern Carpathians and the adjoining plains, today divided between Romania and Ukraine.

Inhabited by many cultures and peoples, settled by both Ukrainians (Ruthenians) and Romanians (Moldavians), it became part of the Kievan Rus&#x27; and Pechenegs&#x27; territory early on during the 10th century and an integral part of the Principality of Moldavia in the 14th century where the capital of Moldavia, Suceava, was founded, eventually expanding its territory all the way to the Black Sea.

Consequently, the culture of the Kievan Rus&#x27; spread in the region during the early Middle Ages. During the time of the Golden Horde, namely in the 14th century (or in the High Middle Ages), Bukovina became part of Moldavia under Hungarian suzerainty (i.e. under the medieval Kingdom of Hungary).

According to the Moldo-Russian Chronicle, the Hungarian king Vladislav (Ladislaus) asked the Old Romans (i.e. Byzantines) and the New Romans (i.e. Vlachs) to fight the Tatars. During the same event, it writes that Dragoș was one of the New Romans. Eventually, Dragoș dismounted Moldavia named from a river (Moldova River) flowing in Bukovina. During a Vlach revolt in Bukovina against Balc, Dragoș&#x27;s grandson, Bogdan the Founder joined the revolt and deposed Balc, securing independence from the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1497 a battle took place at the Cosmin Forest (the hilly forests separating Chernivtsi and Siret valleys), at which Stephen III of Moldavia (Stephen the Great), managed to defeat the much-stronger but demoralized army of King John I Albert of Poland. The battle is known in Polish popular culture as &quot;the battle when the Knights have perished&quot;.

The territory of what became known as Bukovina was, from 1774 (officially May 7, 1775 Treaty of Kuchuk Kainarji) to 1919 (Peace Treaty of Paris St Germain en Laye), an administrative division of the Habsburg monarchy, the Austrian Empire, and Austria-Hungary. The first census that recorded ethnicity was made in 1851 and shows a population of 184,718 or 48.5% Romanians, 144,982 or 38.1% Ukrainians and 51,126 or 13.4% others, with a total population of 380,826 people. By 1910, Romanians and Ukrainians were almost in equal numbers with the Romanians concentrated mainly in the south and the Ukrainians mainly in the north.

In 1940, the northern half of Bukovina was annexed by the Soviet Union in violation of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, a non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The region was temporarily recovered by Romania as an ally of Nazi Germany after the latter invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, but retaken by the Soviet army in 1944. Bukovina&#x27;s population was historically ethnically diverse. Today, Bukovina&#x27;s northern half is the Chernivtsi Oblast of Ukraine, while the southern part is Suceava County of Romania. Bukovina is sometimes known as the &#x27;Switzerland of the East&#x27;, given its diverse ethnic mosaic and deep forested mountainous landscapes.

==Name==
The name first appears in a document issued by the Voivode of Moldavia Roman I Mușat on 30 March 1392, by which he gives to Ionaș Viteazul three villages, located near the Siret river.

The name &quot;Bukovina&quot; came into official use in 1775 with the region&#x27;s annexation from the Principality of Moldavia to the possessions of the Habsburg monarchy, which became the Austrian Empire in 1804, and Austria-Hungary in 1867.

The official German name of the province under Austrian rule (1775–1918), , was derived from the Polish form , which in turn was derived from the common Slavic form of , meaning beech tree (compare Ukrainian ; German ; Hungarian ). Another German name for the region, , is mostly used in poetry, and means &#x27;beech land&#x27;, or &#x27;the land of beech trees&#x27;. In Romanian, in literary or poetic contexts, the name (&#x27;the land of beech trees&#x27;) is sometimes used. In some languages a definite article, sometimes optional, is used before the name: &quot;the Bukovina&quot;, increasingly an archaism in English, which, however, is found in older literature.

In Ukraine, the name (&quot;Bukovyna&quot;) is unofficial, but is common when referring to the &quot;Chernivtsi Oblast&quot;, as over two-thirds of the oblast is the northern part of Bukovina. In Romania, the term &quot;Northern Bukovina&quot; is sometimes synonymous with the entire Chernivtsi Oblast of Ukraine, while &quot;Southern Bukovina&quot; refers to the Suceava County of Romania (although 30% of the present-day Suceava County covers territory outside of the historical Bukovina).

==History==

The territory of Bukovina had been part of Kievan Rus&#x27; since the 10th century. It then became part of the Principality of Galicia, and then part of Moldavia in the 14th century. It was first delineated as a separate district of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria in 1775, and was made a nominal duchy within the Austrian Empire in 1849.

===Background===
The region, which is made up of a portion of the northeastern Carpathian Mountains and the neighbouring plain, was settled by both Vlachs and Ruthenians. After being inhabited by ancient peoples and tribes (Trypillian, Scythians, Dacians, Getae) starting from the Paleolithic, Germanic culture and language emerged in the region in the 4th century by the time of the Goths, archeological research has also indicated that the Romans had a presence in the region. Later, Slavic culture spread, and by the 10th century the region was part of Turkic, Slavic and Romance people like Pechenegs, Cumans, Ruthinians and Vlachs. Among the first references of the Vlachs (Romanians) in the region is in the 10th century by Varangian Sagas referring to the Blakumen people i.e. Vlachs in the land of Pechenegs. By late 12th century chronicle of Niketas Choniates, writes that some Vlachs seized the future Byzantine emperor, Andronikos Komnenos, when &quot;he reached the borders of Halych&quot; in 1164. In the Moldo-Russian Chronicle, writes the events of year 1342, that the Hungarian king Vladislav (Ladislaus) asked the Old Romans and the New Romans to fight the Tatars, by that they will earn a sit in Maramureș. During the same event, it writes that Dragoș was one of the Romans . In the year 1359 Dragoș dismounted Moldavia and took with him many Vlachs and German colonists from Maramureș to Moldavia.

===Early settlement===
First traces of human occupation date back to the Paleolithic. The area was first settled by Trypillian culture tribes, in the Neolithic. It was then settled by now extinct tribes (Dacians/Getae, Thracian/Scythian tribes). Meanwhile, many nomads crossed the region (3rd to 9th century A.D). By the 4th century, the Goths appeared in the region. And later by the 5th and 6th century Slavic people appeared in the region. They were part of the tribal alliance of the Antes. In the 9th century Tivertsi and White Croatians and Cowari composed the local population.

===Kievan Rus===


United by Prince Oleg in the 870s, Kievan Rus&#x27; was a loose federation of speakers of East Slavic and Uralic languages from the late 9th to the mid-13th century, under the reign of the Rurik dynasty, founded by the Varangian prince Rurik. Bukovina gradually became part of Kievan Rus&#x27; from the late 10th century and Pechenegs. Parts of Bukovina were first conquered in 981 by Vladimir the Great. The rest was incorporated into the Principality of Terebovlia in 1084. When Kievan Rus&#x27; was partitioned at the end of the 11th century, Bukovina became part of the Principality of Galicia-Volhynia.

===Principality of Galicia–Volhynia===
After the fragmentation of Kievan Rus&#x27;, Bukovina passed to the Principality of Galicia (Principality of Galicia-Volhynia) in 1124. The Church in Bukovina was initially administered from Kiev. In 1302, it was passed to the Halych metropoly.

After the Mongols under Batu invaded Europe, with the region nominally falling into their hands, ties between Galician-Volhynian and Bukovina weakened. As a result of the Mongol invasion, the Shypyntsi land, recognizing the suzerainty of the Mongols, arose in the region.

Eventually, this state collapsed, and Bukovina passed to Hungary. King Louis I appointed Dragoș, Voivode of Moldavia as his deputy, facilitating the migration of the Romanians from Maramureș and Transylvania.

The Moldavian state was formed by the mid-14th century, eventually expanding its territory all the way to the Black Sea. Upon its foundation, the Moldavian or Moldovan state recognized the supremacy of Poland, keeping on recognizing it from 1387 to 1497. Later (1514) it was vassalized by the Ottoman Empire. Bukovina and neighboring regions became the nucleus of the Moldavian Principality, with the capital successively moving from Baia, to Siret, Suceava, and finally in 1564 to Iași, where it would remain until the end of the principality&#x27;s history. The name of Moldavia () is derived from the Moldova River in Bukovina.

===Polish and Moldavian period===
Petru II moved the seat of Moldova from Siret to Suceava in 1388. In the 15th century, Pokuttya, the region immediately to the north, became the subject of disputes between the Principality of Moldavia and the Polish Kingdom. Pokuttya was inhabited by Ruthenians (the predecessors of modern Ukrainians together with the Rus&#x27;, and of the Rusyns). In 1497 a battle took place at the Cosmin Forest (the hilly forests separating Chernivtsi and Siret valleys), at which Stephen III of Moldavia (Stephen the Great), managed to defeat the much-stronger but demoralized army of King John I Albert of Poland. The battle is known in Polish popular culture as &quot;the battle when the Knights have perished&quot;. The region had been under Polish nominal suzerainty from its foundation (1387) to the time of this battle (1497). Shortly thereafter, it became a vassal of the Ottoman Empire (1514).

In this period, the patronage of Stephen the Great and his successors on the throne of Moldavia saw the construction of the famous painted monasteries of Moldovița, Sucevița, Putna, Humor, Voroneț, Dragomirna, Arbore and others. With their renowned exterior frescoes, these monasteries remain some of the greatest cultural treasures of Romania; some of them are World Heritage Sites, part of the painted churches of northern Moldavia. The most famous monasteries are in the area of Suceava, which today is part of Romania. Also part of Romania is the monastery of , an Orthodox saint and martyr, who was killed by the Tatars in Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi.

From 1490 to 1492, the Mukha rebellion, led by the Ukrainian hero Petro Mukha, took place in Galicia. This event pitted the Moldavians against the oppressive rule of the Polish magnates. A rebel army composed of Moldavian peasants took the fortified towns of Sniatyn, Kolomyia, and Halych, killing many Polish noblemen and burghers, before being halted by the Polish Royal Army in alliance with a Galician &quot;levée en masse&quot; and Prussian mercenaries while marching to Lviv. Many rebels died in the Rohatyn Battle, with Mukha and the survivors fleeing back to Moldavia. Mukha returned to Galicia to re-ignite the rebellion, but was killed in 1492.

In May 1600 Mihai Viteazul (Michael the Brave), became the ruler the two Danubian principalities and Transylvania.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, Ukrainian warriors (&quot;Cossacks&quot;) were involved in many conflicts against the Turkish and Tatar invaders of the Moldavian territory. Notably, Ivan Pidkova, best known as the subject of Ukraine&#x27;s bard Taras Shevchenko&#x27;s &quot;Ivan Pidkova&quot; (1840), led military campaigns in the 1570s. Many Bukovinians joined the Cossacks during the Khmelnytsky uprising. As part of the peasant armies, they formed their own regiment, which participated to the 1648 siege of Lviv. Ukrainian Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky himself led a campaign in Moldavia, whose result was an alliance between Khmelnytsky and its &quot;hospodar&quot; Vasile Lupu. Other prominent Ukrainian leaders fighting against the Turks in Moldovia were Severyn Nalyvaiko and Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny.

For short periods of time (during wars), the Polish Kingdom (to which Moldavians were hostile) again occupied parts of northern Moldavia. However, the old border was re-established each time, as for example on 14 October 1703 the Polish delegate Martin Chometowski said, according to the Polish protocol, &quot;Between us and Wallachia (i.e. the Moldavian region, vassal of the Turks) God himself set Dniester as the border&quot; (&quot;Inter nos et Valachiam ipse Deus flumine Tyras dislimitavit&quot;). According to the Turkish protocol the sentence reads, &quot;God (may He be exalted) has separated the lands of Moldavia [Bukovina, vassal of the Turks] from our Polish lands by the river Dniester.&quot; Strikingly similar sentences were used in other sayings and folkloristic anecdotes, such as the phrase reportedly exclaimed by a member of the Aragonese Cortes in 1684.

In the course of the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774, the Ottoman armies were defeated by the Russian Empire, which occupied the region from 15 December 1769 to September 1774, and previously during 14 September–October 1769. Bukovina was the reward the Habsburgs received for aiding the Russians in that war. Prince Grigore III Ghica of Moldavia protested and was prepared to take action to recover the territory, but was assassinated, and a Greek-Phanariot foreigner was put on the throne of Moldavia by the Ottomans.

=== Austrian Empire ===



Austria occupied Bukovina in October 1774. Following the First Partition of Poland in 1772, the Austrians claimed that they needed it for &quot;a road between Galicia and Transylvania&quot;. Bukovina was formally annexed in January 1775. On 2 July 1776, at Palamutka, Austrians and Ottomans signed a border convention, Austria giving back 59 of the previously occupied villages, retaining 278 villages.

Bukovina was a closed military district (1775–1786), then the largest district, Bukovina District (first known as the Czernowitz District), of the Austrian constituent Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria (1787–1849). On 4 March 1849, Bukovina became a separate Austrian Kronland &#x27;crown land&#x27; under a &quot;Landespräsident&quot; (not a &quot;Statthalter&quot;, as in other crown lands) and was declared the Duchy of Bukovina &quot;Herzogtum Bukowina&quot; (a nominal duchy, as part of the official full style of the Austrian Emperors). In 1860 it was again amalgamated with Galicia but reinstated as a separate province once again on 26 February 1861, a status that would last until 1918.

In 1849 Bukovina got a representative assembly, the &quot;Landtag&quot; (diet). The Moldavian nobility had traditionally formed the ruling class in that territory. In 1867, with the re-organization of the Austrian Empire as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, it became part of the Cisleithanian or Austrian territories of Austria-Hungary and remained so until 1918.

====Late 19th to early 20th centuries====

The 1871 and 1904 celebrations held at Putna Monastery, near the tomb of Stephen the Great, constituted tremendous moments for Romanian national identity in Bukovina. Since gaining its independence, the Kingdom of Romania had had designs on incorporating this province into its new Kingdom. Romanians considered it to be a core part of the old Principality of Moldavia, and of great significance to its history. It contained many prominent historical Moldavian monuments, art and architecture and remained a strong cultural anchor for Moldavians in particular.

During the Habsburg period, the Ukrainian population increased in the north of the region, while in the south the ethnic Romanian population remained the majority population. The Austrians &quot;managed to keep a balance between the various ethnic groups.&quot; In the 1880 census, there were 239,690 Ruthenians and Hutzuls, or roughly 41.5% of the regions population, while Romanians were second with 190,005 people or 33%, a ratio that remained more or less the same until World War I. The percentage of Romanians fell from 85.3% in 1774 to 34.1% in 1910. Ruthenians is an archaic name for Ukrainians, while the Hutsuls are a regional Ukrainian subgroup.

=== Ukrainian national sentiment ===
Ukrainian national sentiment re-ignited in the 1840s. Officially started in 1848, the nationalist movement gained strength in 1869, when the Ruska Besida Society was founded in Chernivtsi. By the 1890s, Ukrainians were represented in the regional diet and Vienna parliament, being led by Stepan Smal-Stotsky. Beside Stotsky, other important Bukovinian leaders were Yerotei Pihuliak, Omelian Popovych, Mykola Vasylko, , , Sylvester Nikorovych, Ivan and Petro Hryhorovych, and Lubomyr Husar. The first periodical in the Ukrainian language, &quot;Bukovyna&quot; (published from 1885 until 1918) was published by the populists since the 1880s. The Ukrainian populists fought for their ethnocultural rights against the Austrians.

Peasant revolts broke out in Hutsul areas in the 1840s, with the peasants demanding more rights, socially and politically. Likewise, nationalist sentiment spread among the Romanians. As a result, more rights were given to Ukrainians and Romanians, with five Ukrainians (including notably Lukian Kobylytsia), two Romanians and one German elected to represent the region. The Ukrainians won representation at the provincial diet as late as 1890, and fought for equality with the Romanians also in the religious sphere. This was partly achieved only as late as on the eve of World War I. However, their achievements were accompanied by friction with Romanians. Overpopulation in the countryside caused migration (especially to North America), also leading to peasant strikes. However, by 1914 Bukovina managed to get &quot;the best Ukrainian schools and cultural-educational institutions of all the regions of Ukraine.&quot; Beside Ukrainians, also Bukovina&#x27;s Germans and Jews, as well as a number of Romanians and Hungarians, emigrated in 19th and 20th century.


Under Austrian rule, Bukovina remained ethnically mixed: Romanians were predominant in the south, Ukrainians (commonly referred to as Ruthenians in the Empire) in the north, with small numbers of Hungarian Székelys, Slovak, and Polish peasants, and Germans, Poles and Jews in the towns. The 1910 census counted 800,198 people, of which: Ruthenians 38.88%, Romanians 34.38%, Germans 21.24% (Jews 12.86% included), Polish people 4.55%, Hungarian people 1.31%, Slovaks 0.08%, Slovenes 0.02%, Italian people 0.02%, and a few Croats, Romani people, Serbs and Turkish people. While reading the statistics it should be mentioned that, due to &quot;adverse economic conditions&quot;, some 50,000 Ukrainians left the region (mostly emigrating to North America) between 1891 and 1910, in the aforementioned migrations. Nonetheless, the percentage of Ukrainians has significantly grown since the end of the eighteenth century.

In 1783, by an imperial decree of Joseph II, the local Eastern Orthodox Eparchy of Bukovina (with its seat in Czernowitz) was placed under spiritual jurisdiction of the Metropolitanate of Karlovci. Some friction appeared in time between the church hierarchy and the Romanians, complaining that Old Church Slavonic was favored to Romanian, and that family names were being slavicized. In spite of Romanian-Slavic speaking frictions over the influence in the local church hierarchy, there was no Romanian-Ukrainian inter-ethnic tension, and both cultures developed in educational and public life. After the rise of Ukrainian nationalism in 1848 and the following rise of Romanian nationalism, Habsburg authorities reportedly awarded additional rights to Ukrainians in an attempt to temper Romanian ambitions of independence. On the other hand, the Ukrainians had to struggle against the Austrians, with the Austrians rejecting both nationalist claims, favoring neither Romanians nor Ukrainians, while attempting to &quot;keep a balance between the various ethnic groups.&quot; Indeed, a group of scholars surrounding the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand were planning to turn Austria-Hungary into a federation. These plans included creating a majority-Romanian state of &quot;Transylvania&quot; within the federation which would have included Bukovina with Czernowitz. After they acquired Bukovina, the Austrians opened only one elementary school in Czernowitz (Ukrainian &#x27;Chernivsti&#x27;, Romanian &#x27;Cernăuți), which taught exclusively in Romanian. They later did open German schools, but no Ukrainian ones. Ukrainian language would appear in Chernivsti&#x27;s schools as late as 1851, but only as a subject, at the local university (in spite of this, the city attracted students from other parts of Bukovina and Galicia, who would study in the German language of instruction). Lukjan Kobylytsia, a Ukrainian Bukovinian farmer and activist, died of torture-related causes after attempting to ask for more rights for the Bukovinian Ukrainians to the Austrians. He died of the consequence of torture in 1851 in Romania. At the end of the 19th century, the development of Ukrainian culture in Bukovina surpassed Galicia and the rest of Ukraine with a network of Ukrainian educational facilities, while Dalmatia formed an archbishopric, later raised to the rank of &quot;Metropolitanate&quot;.

In 1873, the Eastern Orthodox Bishop of Czernowitz (who was since 1783 under the spiritual jurisdiction of the Metropolitan of Karlovci) was elevated to the rank of Archbishop, when a new Metropolitanate of Bukovinian and Dalmatia was created. The new archbishop of Czernowitz gained supreme jurisdiction in all Cisleithania, over &quot;Serbian&quot; eparchies of Dalmatia and Kotor, which were also (until then) under the spiritual jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Karlovci.

In the early 20th century, a group of scholars surrounding the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand created a plan (that never came to pass) of United States of Greater Austria. The specific proposal was published in Aurel C. Popovici&#x27;s book &quot;Die Vereinigten Staaten von Groß-Österreich&quot; [The United States of Greater Austria], Leipzig, 1906. According to it, most of Bukovina (including Czernowitz) would form, with Transylvania, a Romanian state, while the north-western portion (Zastavna, Kozman, Waschkoutz, Wiznitz, Gura Putilei, and Seletin districts) would form with the bigger part of Galicia a Ukrainian state, both in a federation with 13 other states under the Austrian crown.

===Kingdom of Romania===


In World War I, several battles were fought in Bukovina between the Austro-Hungarian, German, and Russian armies, which resulted in the Russian army invading Chernivtsi for three times (30 August to 21 October 1914, 26 November 1914 to 18 February 1915 and 18 June 1916 to 2 August 1917). The regime that had occupied the city pursued a policy of persecution of &quot;nationally conscious Ukrainians&quot;. The situation was not improved until the February Revolution of 1917. The Russian were driven out in 1917. Bukovina suffered great losses during the war.

With the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1918, both the local Romanian National Council and the Ukrainian National Council based in Galicia claimed the region. In the beginning, Bukovina joined the fledging West Ukrainian National Republic (November 1918), but it was occupied by the Romanian army immediately thereafter.

A Constituent Assembly on 14/27 October 1918 formed an executive committee, to whom the Austrian governor of the province handed power. After an official request by Iancu Flondor, Romanian troops swiftly moved in to take over the territory, against Ukrainian protest. Although local Ukrainians attempted to incorporate parts of Northern Bukovina into the short-lived West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, this attempt was defeated by Polish and Romanian troops.

The Ukrainian Regional Committee, led by Omelian Popovych, organized a rally in Chernivtsi on 3 November 1918, demanding Bukovina&#x27;s annexation to Ukraine. The committee took power in the Ukrainian part of Bukovina, including its biggest center Chernivtsi. The Romanian moderates, who were led by Aurel Onciul, accepted the division. However, the Romanian conservatives, led by Iancu Flondor, rejected the idea. In spite of Ukrainian resistance, the Romanian army occupied the Northern Bukovina, including Chernivtsi, on 11 November.

Under the protection of Romanian troops, the Romanian Council summoned a General Congress of Bukovina for 15/28 November 1918, where 74 Romanians, 13 Ruthenians, 7 Germans, and 6 Poles were represented (this is the linguistic composition, and Jews were not recorded as a separate group). According to Romanian historiography, popular enthusiasm swept the whole region, and a large number of people gathered in the city to wait for the resolution of the Congress. The council was quickly summoned by the Romanians upon their occupation of Bukovina.

The Congress elected the Romanian Bukovinian politician Iancu Flondor as chairman, and voted for the union with the Kingdom of Romania, with the support of the Romanian, German, and Polish representatives; the Ukrainians did not support this. The reasons stated were that, until its takeover by the Habsburg in 1775, Bukovina was the heart of the Principality of Moldavia, where the &quot;gropnițele domnești&quot; (voivods&#x27; burial sites) are located, and &quot;dreptul de liberă hotărâre de sine&quot; (right of self-determination). Romanian control of the province was recognized internationally in the Treaty of St. Germain in 1919. Bukovina&#x27;s autonomy was undone during Romanian occupation, the region being reduced to an ordinary Romanian province. It was subject to martial law from 1918 to 1928, and again from 1937 to 1940.

The Ukrainian language was suppressed, &quot;educational and cultural institutions, newspapers and magazines were closed.&quot;

Romanian authorities oversaw a renewed programme of Romanianization aiming its assimilationist policies at the Ukrainian population of the region. In addition to the suppression of the Ukrainian people, their language and culture, Ukrainian surnames were Rumanized, and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church was persecuted. In the 1930s an underground nationalist movement, which was led by Orest Zybachynsky and Denys Kvitkovsky, emerged in the region. The Romanian government suppressed it by staging two political trials in 1937.

At the same time, Ukrainian enrollment at the Cernăuți University fell from 239 out of 1671, in 1914, to 155 out of 3,247, in 1933, while simultaneously Romanian enrollment there increased several times to 2,117 out of 3,247. In part this was due to attempts to switch to Romanian as the primary language of university instruction, but chiefly to the fact that the university was one of only five in Romania, and was considered prestigious.

In the decade following 1928, as Romania tried to improve its relations with the Soviet Union, Ukrainian culture was given some limited means to redevelop, though these gains were sharply reversed in 1938.

According to the 1930 Romanian census, Romanians made up 44.5% of the total population of Bukovina, and Ukrainians (including Hutsuls) 29.1%. In the northern part of the region, however, Romanians made up only 32.6% of the population, with Ukrainians significantly outnumbering Romanians.

On 14 August 1938 Bukovina officially disappeared from the map, becoming a part of Ținutul Suceava, one of ten new administrative regions. At the same time, Cernăuți, the third most populous town in Romania (after Bucharest and Chișinău), which had been a mere county seat for the last 20 years, became again a (regional) capital. Also, Bukovinian regionalism continued under the new brand. During its first months of existence, Ținutul Suceava suffered far right (Iron Guard) uproars, to which the regional governor Gheorghe Alexianu (the future governor of the Transnistria Governorate) reacted with nationalist and anti-Semitic measures. Alexianu was replaced by Gheorghe Flondor on 1 February 1939.

===Division of Bukovina===
As a result of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, the USSR demanded not only Bessarabia but also the northern half of Bukovina and Hertsa regions from Romania on 26 June 1940 (Bukovina bordered Eastern Galicia, which the USSR had annexed during the Invasion of Poland). Initially, the USSR wanted the whole of Bukovina. Nazi Germany, which was surprised by the Soviet claim to Bukovina, invoked the German ethnics living in the region. As a result, the USSR only demanded the northern, overwhelmingly Ukrainian part, arguing that it was a &quot;reparation for the great loss produced to the Soviet Union and Bassarabia&#x27;s population by twenty-two years of Romanian domination of Bassarabia&quot;. Following the Soviet ultimatum, Romania ceded Northern Bukovina, which included Cernăuți, to the USSR on 28 June 1940. The withdrawal of the Romanian Army, authorities, and civilians was disastrous. Mobs attacked retreating soldiers and civilians, whereas a retreating unit massacred Jewish soldiers and civilians in the town of Dorohoi. The Red Army occupied Cernăuți and Storojineț counties, as well as parts of Rădăuți and Dorohoi counties (the latter belonged to Ținutul Suceava, but not to Bukovina). The new Soviet-Romanian border was traced less than north of Putna Monastery. Until 22 September 1940, when Ținutul Suceava was abolished, the spa town Vatra Dornei served as the capital of Ținutul Suceava.

====Second World War====
In 1940, Chernivtsi Oblast ( of which is Northern Bukovina) had a population of circa 805,000, out of which 47.5% were Ukrainians and 28.3% were Romanians, with Germans, Jews, Poles, Hungarians, and Russians comprising the rest. The strong Ukrainian presence was the official motivation for the inclusion of the region into the Ukrainian SSR and not into the newly formed Moldavian SSR. Whether the region would have been included in the Moldavian SSR, if the commission presiding over the division had been led by someone other than the communist leader Nikita Khrushchev, remains a matter of debate among scholars. In fact, some territories with a mostly Romanian population (e.g., Hertsa region) were allotted to the Ukrainian SSR.
After the instauration of Soviet rule, under NKVD orders, thousands of local families were deported to Siberia during this period, with 12,191 people targeted for deportation in a document dated 2 August 1940 (from all formerly Romanian regions included in the Ukrainian SSR), while a December 1940 document listed 2,057 persons to be deported to Siberia. The largest action took place on 13 June 1941, when about 13,000 people were deported to Siberia and Kazakhstan. The majority of those targeted were ethnic native Romanians, but there were (to a lesser degree) representatives of other ethnicities, as well.

Until the repatriation convention of 15 April 1941, NKVD troops killed hundreds of Romanian peasants of Northern Bukovina as they tried to cross the border into Romania to escape from Soviet authorities. This culminated on 7 February 1941 with the Lunca massacre and on 1 April 1941 with the Fântâna Albă massacre.

During Soviet Communist rule in Bukovina, &quot;private property was nationalized; farms were partly collectivized; and education was Ukrainianized. At the same time all Ukrainian organizations were disbanded, and many publicly active Ukrainians were either killed or exiled.&quot; A significant part of Ukrainian intelligentsia fled to Romania and Germany in the beginning of the occupation. When the conflict between the Soviets and Nazi Germany broke out, and the Soviet troops began moving out of Bukovina, the Ukrainian locals attempted to established their own government, but they were not able to stop the advancing Romanian army.

Almost the entire German population of Northern Bukovina was coerced to resettle in 1940–1941 to the parts of Poland then occupied by Nazi Germany, during 15 September 1940 – 15 November 1940, after this area was occupied by the Soviet Union. About 45,000 ethnic Germans had left Northern Bukovina by November 1940.

In the course of the 1941 attack on the Soviet Union by the Axis forces, the Romanian Third Army led by General Petre Dumitrescu (operating in the north), and the Fourth Romanian Army (operating in the south) regained Northern Bukovina, as well as Hertsa, and Bassarabia, during June–July 1941. It was organized as part of the Bukovina Governorate.

The Axis invasion of Northern Bukovina was catastrophic for its Jewish population, as conquering Romanian soldiers immediately began massacring its Jewish residents. Surviving Jews were forced into ghettoes to await deportation to work camps in Transnistria where 57,000 had arrived by 1941. One of the Romanian mayors of Cernăuți, Traian Popovici, managed to temporarily exempt from deportation 20,000 Jews living in the city between the fall of 1941 and the spring of 1942. Bukovina&#x27;s remaining Jews were spared from certain death when it was retaken by Soviet forces in February 1944. In all, about half of Bukovina&#x27;s entire Jewish population had perished. After the war and the return of the Soviets, most of the Jewish survivors from Northern Bukovina fled to Romania (and later settled in Israel).

====After the war====


In 1944 the Red Army drove the Axis forces out and re-established Soviet control over the territory. Romania was forced to formally cede the northern part of Bukovina to the USSR by the 1947 Paris peace treaty. The territory became part of the Ukrainian SSR as Chernivtsi Oblast (province). While during the war the Soviet government killed or forced in exile a considerable number of Ukrainians, after the war the same government deported or killed about 41,000 Romanians. As a result of killings and mass deportations, entire villages, mostly inhabited by Romanians, were abandoned (Albovat, Frunza, I.G.Duca, Buci—completely erased, Prisaca, Tanteni and Vicov—destroyed to a large extent). Men of military age (and sometimes above), both Ukrainians and Romanians, were conscripted into the Soviet Army. That did not protect them, however, from being arrested and deported for being &quot;anti-Soviet elements&quot;.

As a reaction, partisan groups (composed of both Romanians and Ukrainians) began to operate against the Soviets in the woods around Chernivtsi, Crasna and Codrii Cosminului. In Crasna (in the former Storozhynets county) villagers attacked Soviet soldiers who were sent to &quot;temporarily resettle&quot; them, since they feared deportation. This resulted in dead and wounded among the villagers, who had no firearms.

Spring 1945 saw the formation of transports of Polish repatriates who (voluntarily or by coercion) had decided to leave. Between March 1945 and July 1946, 10,490 inhabitants left Northern Bukovina for Poland, including 8,140 Poles, 2,041 Jews and 309 of other nationalities. Most of them settled in Silesia, near the towns: Bolesławiec, Dzierżoniów, Gubin, Lubań Śląski, Lwówek Śląski, Nowa Sól, Oława, Prudnik, Wrocław, Zielona Góra, Żagań, Żary.

Overall, between 1930 (last Romanian census) and 1959 (first Soviet census), the population of Northern Bukovina decreased by 31,521 people. According to official data from those two censuses, the Romanian population had decreased by 75,752 people, and the Jewish population by 46,632, while the Ukrainian and Russian populations increased by 135,161 and 4,322 people, respectively.

After 1944, the human and economic connections between the northern (Soviet) and southern (Romanian) parts of Bukovina were severed. Today, the historically Ukrainian northern part is the nucleus of the Ukrainian Chernivtsi Oblast, while the southern part is part of Romania, though there are minorities of Ukrainians and Romanians in Romanian Bukovina and Ukrainian Bukovina respectively. Ukrainians are still a recognized minority in Romania, and have one seat reserved in the Romanian Chamber of Deputies.

In Romania, 28 November is a holiday observed as Bukovina Day. A popular Romanian-language song about the region is &quot;Cântă cucu-n Bucovina&quot; (&quot;Sings the Cuckoo in Bukovina&quot;).

==Geography==
Bukovina proper has an area of . The territory of Romanian (or Southern) Bukovina is located in northeastern Romania and it is part of the Suceava County (plus three localities in Botoșani County), whereas Ukrainian (or Northern) Bukovina is located in western Ukraine and it is part of the Chernivtsi Oblast.

== Population ==

=== Historical population ===

The region was occupied by several now extinct peoples. After which it was settled by both Romanians (Moldavians) and Ukrainians (Ruthenians) with the Antes controlling a large area that included Bukovina by the 6th century. Later, the region was part of Kievan Rus&#x27;, and later still of the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia. During this period it reinforced its ties to other Ukrainian lands, with many Bukovinian natives studying in Lviv and Kyiv, and the Orthodox Bukovinian Church flourishing in the region. After passing to Hungary in the 14th century, the Hungarian king appointed Dragoș as his deputy forming the principality of Moldavia, following the revolt of Bogdan the Founder against the Kingdom of Hungary, Bukovina became an integral part of the principality of Moldavia. Suceava, in the south of the territory, was the capital of Moldavia from the late 14th to the mid-16th century. The only data we have about the ethnic composition of Bukovina are the Austrian censuses starting from the 1770s. The Austrians hindered both Romanian and Ukrainian nationalisms. On the other hand, they favored the migration in Bukovina of Ukrainians from Galicia as well as Romanians from Transylvania and Maramureș.

According to the 1775 Austrian census, the province had a total population of 86,000 (this included 56 villages which were returned to Moldavia one year later). The census only recorded social status and some ethno-religious groups (Jews, Armenians, Roma, and German colonists). Historian Ion Nistor estimated that the 1774 population consisted of 52,750 Romanians (also called Moldavians) (73.5%), 15,000 Ruthenians and Hutsuls (20.9%) (of whom 6,000 were Hutsuls, and 9,000 were Ruthenian immigrants from Galicia and Podolia settled in Moldavia around 1766), and 4,000 others who &quot;use the Romanian language in conversation&quot; (5.6%), consisting of Armenians, Jews and Roma. Keith Hitchins on the other hand, estimated that in 1774 Bukovina&#x27;s population consisted of 64,000 Romanians, 8,000 Ukrainians and 3,000 Germans, Jews, and Poles. According to Alecu Hurmuzaki, by 1848, out of a population of 377,581 people, 209,293 or 55.4% of the population was Romanian. At the same time, the Ukrainian population rose to 108,907 and the Jewish population surged from 526 in 1774, to 11,600 in 1848.


In 2011, an anthropological analysis of the Russian census of the population of Moldavia in 1774 asserted a population of 68,700 people in 1774, out of which 40,920 (59.6%) Romanians, 22,810 Ruthenians and Hutsuls (33.2%), and 7.2% Jews, Roma, and Armenians.

Based on the above anthropological estimate for 1774 as well as subsequent official censuses, the ethnic composition of Bukovina changed in the years after 1775 when the Austrian Empire occupied the region. The population of Bukovina increased steadily, primarily through immigration, which Austrian authorities encouraged to develop the economy. Indeed, the migrants entering the region came from Ukrainian Galicia, as well as from Romanian Transylvania and Moldavia. Another Austrian official report from 1783, referring to the villages between the Dniester and the Prut, indicated Ruthenian-speaking immigrants from Poland constituting a majority, with only a quarter of the population speaking Moldavian. The same report indicated that Moldavians constituted the majority in the area of Suceava. H.F. Müller gives the 1840 population used for purposes of military conscription as 339,669.

In 1843 the Ruthenian language was recognized, along with the Romanian language, as &#x27;the language of the people and of the Church in Bukovina&#x27;.

During the 19th century, as mentioned, the Austrian Empire policies encouraged the influx of migrants coming from Transylvania, Moldavia, Galicia and the heartland of Austria and Germany, with Germans, Poles, Jews, Hungarians, Romanians, and Ukrainians settling in the region. Official censuses in the Austrian Empire (later Austria-Hungary) did not record ethnolinguistic data until 1850–1851. The 1857 and 1869 censuses omitted ethnic or language-related questions. &#x27;Familiar language spoken&#x27; was not recorded again until 1880.

The Austrian census of 1850–1851, which recorded data regarding languages spoken, shows 48.50% Romanians and 38.07% Ukrainians. Subsequent Austrian censuses between 1880 and 1910 reveal a Romanian population stabilizing around 33% and a Ukrainian population around 40%. From 1774 to 1910, the percentage of Ukrainians increased, meanwhile the one of Romanians decreased.

According to the 1930 Romanian census, Bukovina had a population of 853,009. Romanians made up 44.5% of the population, while 27.7% were Ukrainians/Ruthenians (plus 1.5% Hutsuls), 10.8% Jews, 8.9% Germans, 3.6% Poles, and 3.0% others or undeclared.

According to estimates and censuses data, the population of Bukovina was:

Note: e-estimate; c-census

=== Current population ===

The present demographic situation in Bukovina hardly resembles that of the Austrian Empire. The northern (Ukrainian) and southern (Romanian) parts became significantly dominated by their Ukrainian and Romanian majorities, respectively, with the representation of other ethnic groups being decreased significantly.

According to the data of the 2001 Ukrainian census, the Ukrainians represent about 75% (689,100) of the population of Chernivtsi Oblast, which is the closest, although not an exact, approximation of the territory of the historic Northern Bukovina. The census also identified a fall in the Romanian and Moldovan populations to 12.5% (114,600) and 7.3% (67,200), respectively. Russians are the next largest ethnic group with 4.1%, while Poles, Belarusians, and Jews comprise the rest 1.2%. The languages of the population closely reflect the ethnic composition, with over 90% within each of the major ethnic groups declaring their national language as the mother tongue (Ukrainian, Romanian, and Russian, respectively).

The fact that Romanians and Moldovans, a self-declared majority in some regions, were presented as separate categories in the census results, has been criticized in Romania, where there are complains that this artificial Soviet-era practice results in the Romanian population being undercounted, as being divided between Romanians and Moldovans. The Romanian minority of Ukraine also claims to represent a 500,000-strong community.

The Romanians mostly inhabit the southern part of the Chernivtsi region, having been the majority in former Hertsa Raion and forming a plurality together with Moldovans in former Hlyboka Raion. Self-declared Moldovans were the majority in Novoselytsia Raion. In the other eight districts and the city of Chernivtsi, Ukrainians were the majority. However, after the 2020 administrative reform in Ukraine, all these districts were abolished, and most of the areas merged into Chernivtsi Raion, where Romanians are not in majority anymore.

The southern, or Romanian Bukovina reportedly has a significant Romanian majority (94.8%) according to Romanian sources, the largest minority group being the Romani people (1.9%) and Ukrainians, who make up 0.9% of the population (2011 census). Other minor ethnic groups include Lipovans, Poles (in Cacica, Mănăstirea Humorului, Mușenița, Moara, and Păltinoasa), Zipser Germans (in Cârlibaba and Iacobeni) and Bukovina Germans (in Suceava, Rădăuți, and Câmpulung Moldovenesc), as well as Slovaks and Jews (almost exclusively in Suceava, Rădăuți and Siret).

Concerns have been raised about the way census are handled in Romania. For example, according to the 2011 Romanian census, Ukrainians of Romania number 51,703 people, making up 0.3% of the total population. However, Ukrainian nationalists of the 1990s claimed the region had 110,000 Ukrainians. The Ukrainian descendants of the Zaporozhian Cossacks who fled Russian rule in the 18th century, living in the Dobruja region of the Danube Delta, also complained similar practices. In 1992, their descendants numbered four thousand people according to official Romanian statistics. However, the local community claims to number 20,000, five times the number stated by Romanian authorities. Rumanization, with the closure of schools and suppression of the language, happened in all areas in present-day Romania where the Ukrainians live or lived. The very term &quot;Ukrainians&quot; was prohibited from the official usage and some Romanians of disputable Ukrainian ethnicity were rather called the &quot;citizens of Romania who forgot their native language&quot; and were forced to change their last names to Romanian-sounding ones. In Bukovina, the practice of Romanization dates to much earlier than the 20th century. Since Louis of Hungary appointed Dragoș, Voivode of Moldavia as his deputy, there was an introduction of Romanians in Bukovina, and a process of Romanization that intensified in the 1560s.

Places such as the etymologically Ukrainian Breaza and Moldovița (whose name in German is &quot;Russ Moldawitza&quot;, and used to be &quot;Ruska Moldavyda&quot; in Ukrainian), Șerbăuți and Siret used to have an overwhelming Ukrainian majority. In some places in southern Bukovina, such as Balkivtsi (Romanian: &quot;Bălcăuți&quot;), Izvoarele Sucevei, Ulma and Negostina, Ukrainian majority is still reported in Romanian census. On other hand in North Bukovina the Romanians used to be the biggest ethnic group in the city of Chernivtsi, as well as in the towns of Hlyboka and Storozhynets, and still are in Boiany and Krasnoilsk.

<doc id="224693" wikidata="Q467744" url="?curid=224693" title="Albertina Sisulu">
<text>Albertina Sisulu  ( Nontsikelelo Thethiwe; 21 October 1918 – 2 June 2011) was a South African anti-apartheid activist. A member of the African National Congress (ANC), she was the founding co-president of the United Democratic Front. In South Africa, where she was affectionately known as Ma Sisulu, she is often called a mother of the nation. 

Born in rural Transkei, Sisulu moved to Johannesburg in 1940 and was a nurse by profession. She entered politics through her marriage to Walter Sisulu and became increasingly engaged in activism after his imprisonment in the Rivonia Trial. In the 1980s she emerged as a community leader in her hometown of Soweto, assuming a prominent role in the establishment of the UDF and the revival of the Federation of South African Women. 

Between 1964 and 1989, she was subject to a near-continuous string of banning orders. In addition to intermittent detention without trial, she was subject to criminal charges on three occasions: she was acquitted of violating pass laws in 1958, convicted of violating the Suppression of Communism Act in 1984, and acquitted of violating the Internal Security Act in the 1985 Pietermaritzburg Treason Trial. 

After the end of apartheid, Sisulu represented the ANC in the first democratic Parliament before she retired from politics in 1999. She was also the deputy president of the ANC Women&#x27;s League from 1991 to 1993 and a member of the ANC National Executive Committee from 1991 to 1994. 

==Early life and education==
Sisulu was born on 21 October 1918 in the Camama, a village in the Tsomo region of the Transkei. She was the second of five siblings in a Xhosa (Mfengu) family. Her father, Bonilizwe Thetiwe, was a migrant worker who spent long stints working in the gold mines of the Transvaal, and her mother, Monica Thetiwe (), was disabled by the bout of Spanish flu that she had suffered while pregnant with Sisulu. Sisulu and her siblings spent most of their childhood with their maternal grandparents in the village of Xolobe, where Sisulu began school at a Presbyterian mission. Though her family called her &quot;Ntsiki&quot; throughout her life, she assumed the name Albertina at school, choosing it from a list of European Christian names provided by her missionary schoolteachers.

In 1929, while Sisulu&#x27;s mother was pregnant with her fifth and final child, Sisulu&#x27;s father died of occupational lung disease in Camama. Her mother remained in ill health until her death in 1941, so Sisulu – both the eldest sister and the eldest female cousin – became a primary caregiver to her younger siblings and cousins, with frequent interruptions to her education as a result. Nonetheless, in 1936, she received a scholarship for secondary schooling at Mariazell College, a Catholic boarding school in Matatiele. She covered her living expenses by ploughing fields and working in the laundry room during school holidays. Newly converted to Catholicism, she intended to become a nun or school principal, but her headmaster, Father Bernard Huss, convinced her to pursue training as a nurse after she finished school in 1939. 

== Anti-apartheid activism ==
In January 1940, Sisulu moved to Johannesburg, where she began her long nursing career as a trainee in the non-European section of the Johannesburg General Hospital. She qualified as a nurse in 1944 and later qualified as a midwife too. Her interest in politics grew through her association with Walter Sisulu, a real estate agent and activist in the African National Congress (ANC), who courted and then married her. She began attending ANC meetings not as a member but as his companion. In her own description, &quot;I had no political ideas. I was devout until I met Walter.&quot; Ellen Kuzwayo, another of the few women present at such meetings, later remembered her as &quot;a kind hostess who served the committee members of the congress with tea after long and intense meetings&quot;. In this capacity, as Walter&#x27;s fiancée, she was the only woman present at the inaugural meeting of the ANC Youth League in 1944. 

According to Pippa Green, she joined the ANC Women&#x27;s League in 1946. In addition, the Sisulus&#x27; home in Orlando West, a suburb of Soweto outside Johannesburg, was long-established as a meeting place for ANC leaders. However, her husband&#x27;s political activities made Sisulu the family&#x27;s main breadwinner, and she did not actively participate in ANC activities until the 1950s, by which time the National Party had introduced its programme of institutionalised apartheid. She abstained from the 1952 Defiance Campaign, during which Walter was arrested and convicted of communism; in her paraphrase of the ANC&#x27;s policies, &quot;if one of the members of the family was already defying, we couldn&#x27;t all go, because there were children to be looked after&quot;. 

=== 1948–1963: Pre-Rivonia Trial ===
Opposition to apartheid accelerated in 1954 and 1955, and Sisulu was involved in several related campaigns. She was elected to the inaugural national executive committee of the Federation of South African Women (FEDSAW) when it was founded in 1954. In 1955, she participated in the Freedom Charter leafleting campaign ahead of the Congress of the People, and at the same time participated in a boycott of public schools in protest of the Bantu Education Act; the Sisulus&#x27; home housed one of the so-called alternative schools set up as part of the protest. She was present at the August 1956 Women&#x27;s March in Pretoria, and in October 1958 she was arrested for the first time and charged for participating in another women&#x27;s march against pass laws. On the latter occasion, she was detained for three weeks on charges of violating the pass laws, but she was ultimately acquitted, with her husband&#x27;s close friend Nelson Mandela as her lawyer. In the early 1960s, she was involved in an ANC scheme to recruit nurses as volunteers to relocate to newly independent Tanganyika, a personal favour from Oliver Tambo to Julius Nyerere.

Meanwhile, Sisulu&#x27;s husband was a defendant in the 1956–1961 Treason Trial, and their home became a target for Security Branch attention and raids. After the 1960 Sharpeville uprising, the apartheid government banned the ANC and several associated organisations; shortly afterwards, the ANC announced the inauguration of armed struggle. Her husband, a founder of Umkhonto we Sizwe, went into hiding underground in 1963. On 19 June of that year, Sisulu became the first woman to be detained under the so-called 90-Day Detention Law: the recently enacted General Laws Amendment Act, 1963 allowed police to detain activists incommunicado indefinitely and without charging them. She was held in solitary confinement and interrogated at length about Walter&#x27;s whereabouts. She was released after her husband and his comrades were apprehended at Rivonia in July 1963. The ensuing Rivonia Trial concluded in June 1964 with Walter being sentenced to life imprisonment. During the trial, Sisulu redoubled her engagement with the ANC Women&#x27;s League. 
=== 1964–1989: Post-Rivonia Trial ===

In August 1964, in the aftermath of the Rivonia convictions, Sisulu was served with the first in a series of banning orders. She was banned continuously for the next 17 years, prohibited from political activity and for several years confined to effective house arrest. The Minister of Law and Order allowed her fourth ban to lapse in August 1981, and she celebrated by making an address – her first political speech since the early 1960s – at a local church&#x27;s commemoration of the Women&#x27;s March. The respite lasted less than a year before she was arrested and served with another banning order, her fifth, in June 1982; that order was part of a more general crackdown effected in Soweto during commemorations of the 1976 Soweto uprising.

Nonetheless, throughout this period, Sisulu remained a prominent figure in the resistance movement, notable for her focus on civic organising on a national rather than local scale. She was particularly influential in the preparations for the establishment of the United Democratic Front (UDF), a popular front against apartheid that was launched in 1983, and in a protracted campaign to revive FEDSAW. From the 1970s, she was active in the political mentorship of younger women activists such as Jessie Duarte and Susan Shabangu; Duarte later said that Sisulu&#x27;s protégés considered themselves &quot;MaSisulu&#x27;s girls&quot;, and she was instrumental in the foundation of a Soweto-based underground ANC cell for women, named &quot;Thusang Basadi&quot; (&quot;wake up women&quot;).

==== Communism trial and UDF launch ====
Sisulu&#x27;s June 1982 banning order was allowed to lapse after only a year, and in July 1983 she attended meetings of the national steering committee that was preparing for the national launch of the UDF. However, on 5 August, she was arrested again at her workplace and charged with a violation of the Suppression of Communism Act. She and her co-accused, activist Thami Mali, were accused of having conspired to further the aims of the banned ANC in connection with their role in planning the funeral of Rose Mbele, an ANC Women&#x27;s League Stalwart. The funeral had taken place months earlier – on 16 January 1983 in a church in Soweto – and the charges were widely viewed as a justification to detain Sisulu ahead of the UDF&#x27;s launch.

Later in August, while Sisulu was awaiting trial in solitary confinement in Diepkloof, the UDF was launched. She was elected in absentia as the regional president of the UDF&#x27;s Transvaal branch, and then, at the front&#x27;s national launch in Mitchell&#x27;s Plain on 20 August, as one of the three national co-presidents of the UDF, the others being Oscar Mpetha and Archie Gumede. Her trial began in Krugersdorp shortly afterwards, with George Bizos as her defence counsel. On 24 February 1984, in a ruling condemned by the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid, she was convicted and sentenced to four years&#x27; imprisonment, with two years of the sentence suspended for five years. However, she was also released on bail pending an appeal, allowing her to resume her political activities; she said that, after several consecutive months in solitary confinement, &quot;I came out speaking to the walls&quot;. The appeal against her sentence was ultimately upheld in 1987.

==== Abu Baker Asvat and Mandela United ====
In 1983, Sisulu retired from public nursing, having reached retirement age and received her pension. The following year, in the aftermath of her criminal trial, she began work as receptionist and nursing assistant in Rockville, Soweto in the private surgery of Abu Baker Asvat, a doctor who was renowned for his humanitarianism. Although Asvat was a leading member of the Azanian People&#x27;s Organisation, a rival of the UDF, the pair worked closely together; she later said that they were like mother and son, and he did not object to Sisulu&#x27;s political activities, which continued in earnest. 

This period was also marked by increasing tension between Sisulu and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Nelson Mandela&#x27;s wife, whose Mandela United Football Club engaged in gangsterism and intimidation in Soweto from around 1986 onward. Because of the friendship between their husbands, Sisulu and Madikizela-Mandela had been close during their youth; arrested together in 1958, Sisulu had nursed Mandela through the near-miscarriage of her first child in a jail cell. However, in the 1980s, their relationship grew tense as Sisulu attempted to curb Mandela United&#x27;s excesses. Sisulu later said that, &quot;As a woman, I tried to pull her out of that... Winnie and I were never enemies, I tried to help her.&quot; According to historian Jonny Steinberg, other members of the community delegated Sisulu to report their concerns about Madikizela-Mandela&#x27;s behaviour to the exiled ANC leadership in Lusaka, Zambia. In later years, because of their husbands&#x27; stature, the press often contrasted Madikizela-Mandela and Sisulu as opposing models of female activism, comparing Sisulu&#x27;s cool-headed maturity with Madikizela-Mandela&#x27;s &quot;rage and charm&quot;.

Meanwhile, Asvat was an unpopular figure both with the state and with conservative residents of Soweto; in 1987, Sisulu was with him when he narrowly escaped a knife attack, and in December 1988, they worked without water or electricity after the supply to their surgery was cut off. On the afternoon of 27 January 1989, Asvat was fatally shot at his surgery while Sisulu was in the dispensary at the rear of the clinic; he died shortly afterwards in Sisulu&#x27;s presence. She had admitted the gunmen to an appointment with Asvat earlier that day. Madikizela-Mandela and her Football Club long faced rumours of having arranged Asvat&#x27;s assassination, and Sisulu was publicly drawn into those accusations in 1997 .

==== Pietermaritzburg Treason Trial ====

In 1984, while Sisulu was working at Asvat&#x27;s surgery and awaiting the appeal of her criminal conviction, the UDF vastly expanded its national presence through an intensive campaign of opposition to President P. W. Botha&#x27;s constitutional reforms, including the Black Authorities Act, 1982 and the 1983 Constitution. The first elections to the Tricameral Parliament in August 1984 were marred by a successful UDF boycott, followed by widespread township uprisings. In a subsequent crackdown by Botha&#x27;s government, Sisulu was arrested on 19 February 1985. She and 15 others were charged under the Internal Security Act with treason and incitement to overthrow the government. As the only woman accused, she was held in detention alone.

On 3 May 1985, Sisulu and her co-accused were released on bail with stringent conditions. The ensuing Pietermaritzburg Treason Trial opened on 21 October in the Natal Supreme Court with the defendants&#x27; not-guilty plea, but the charges against Sisulu and 11 others were dropped on 9 December. Sisulu told press it was &quot;a crushing victory for us&quot;. Popular uprisings continued, and Sisulu was banned again in 1986 and in early 1988. 

=== 1989–1994: Negotiations ===
In 1989, as the negotiations to end apartheid quickened, Sisulu embraced her public-facing role in the anti-apartheid movement. In June that year, she was granted her first South African passport – an abrupt reversal, given that her latest banning order had been renewed only days earlier. Later that month, she led a UDF delegation on an international tour, which included a meeting with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. While in London, she met with Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock and addressed a major rally of the British Anti-Apartheid Movement. On 30 June 1989, she met with American President George H. W. Bush in the White House. The delegation also travelled to Sweden; to France, on the invitation of Danielle Mitterrand; and to the ANC&#x27;s headquarters in exile in Lusaka, where Sisulu provided exiled leaders with a report on conditions inside South Africa.

The last of the restrictions against Sisulu were lifted by the South African government on 14 October 1989. Meanwhile, President F. W. de Klerk&#x27;s government unbanned the ANC in 1990, permitting the party to resume overt organising inside South Africa. Sisulu became involved in the campaign to re-establish the ANC Women&#x27;s League, though she declined a nomination to stand for the league&#x27;s presidency. Instead, at the league&#x27;s first national conference in Kimberley in April 1991, she threw her support behind Gertrude Shope, who defeated Madikizela-Mandela to become the league&#x27;s president. At the same conference, Sisulu was elected to deputise Shope as the league&#x27;s deputy president. Over the next two years, she worked at the league&#x27;s downtown headquarters in Shell House. However, she held the deputy presidency for only one term, ceding the office to Thandi Modise at the league&#x27;s next national conference in December 1993.

The mainstream ANC held its own reunion in July 1991 at the 48th National Conference in Durban, where Sisulu was elected to serve as a member of the party&#x27;s National Executive Committee. She only served one three-year term in the committee; at the 49th National Conference in December 1994, both she and her husband declined to stand for re-election to the party&#x27;s leadership.

==Post-apartheid political career==

=== National Assembly ===

Sisulu later said that, as a member of the ANC National Executive, she had been highly doubtful of Mandela&#x27;s proposal to reconcile with National Party supporters in the interests of national unity. As she told a reporter, &quot;The first meeting of the [ANC] national executives, when Mandela introduced this to us, we all stood up and said, &#x27;He&#x27;s now mad.&#x27; We thought he was mad, to say we must reconcile. Shooo!&quot;. Nonetheless, ahead of the first post-apartheid democratic elections, she accepted nomination to stand as an ANC candidate for election to the new multi-racial Parliament of South Africa, and she was comfortably elected to a seat in the lower house, the National Assembly. 

When the Houses of Parliament opened on 10 May 1994, it was Sisulu who formally nominated Mandela to serve as the first post-apartheid President of South Africa. Her biographer said it was &quot;one of the proudest moments of her life&quot; to be selected to offer the nomination on the ANC&#x27;s behalf. She served one term in Parliament, retiring at the June 1999 general election. 

=== Truth and Reconciliation Commission ===
During this period, her most prominent engagement was that with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in 1997. She was expected to provide important testimony in the TRC&#x27;s investigation into the activities of the Mandela United Football Club, in particular through her account of the day of Asvat&#x27;s murder and of the relationship between Asvat and Madikizela-Mandela. Moreover, earlier that year, a videotaped interview with Sisulu had been included in &quot;Katiza&#x27;s Journey&quot;, a BBC documentary in which journalist Fred Bridgland claimed to uncover evidence that Madikizela-Mandela had conspired to kidnap Stompie Seipei as well as to murder Asvat. In that interview, Sisulu had confirmed the authenticity of a patient record card from Asvat&#x27;s surgery which undermined Madikizela-Mandela&#x27;s alibi on the day of Seipei&#x27;s death; she said that she recognised her own handwriting on the card. She later said that she had made this identification in error.

Sisulu&#x27;s appearance before the TRC on 1 December received international attention. However, after giving an emotional account of Asvat&#x27;s shooting, she provided what were described as &quot;evasive&quot; responses to questions about Madikizela-Mandela&#x27;s involvement in Asvat and Seipei&#x27;s deaths; she denied having signed the crucial patient record card, denied any knowledge of a row between Madikizela-Mandela and Asvat, and said, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t think that Mrs. Mandela could kill Asvat because I thought they were friendly&quot;. She said that she did not recall having seen Madikizela-Mandela or her colleagues at the surgery during the period of Seipei&#x27;s kidnapping.

During intensive cross-examination, TRC commissioner Dumisa Ntsebeza told Sisulu that she appeared to be &quot;trying your very best to say as little as possible, anything that can implicate Mrs. Mandela&quot; and asked whether this was because of &quot;struggle morality&quot; – because &quot;she is your comrade and the Mandela and Sisulus go back a very long way&quot;. Sisulu responded with indignant weeping, recounting her years of involvement in activism and saying, &quot;Even if I am shielding her, I am not here to tell lies.&quot; Commissioner Alex Boraine also expressed dissatisfaction with apparent inconsistencies in Sisulu&#x27;s testimony.

The day after her testimony, Sisulu and her husband met with Desmond Tutu, the chairman of the TRC, to discuss her unhappiness at having been accused of dishonesty. On 4 December, the TRC heard further evidence which confirmed Sisulu&#x27;s account that it was not her signature on the disputed record card. Sisulu briefly re-appeared on the witness stand, at her own request, and Ntsebeza told her that she had been &quot;vindicated&quot; and restored as &quot;an icon of moral rectitude&quot;.

== Personal and family life ==
Sisulu met her husband, Walter, in 1941, and their families agreed on lobola the following year; they married on 15 July 1944 in a civil ceremony in Cofimvaba. Walter&#x27;s best man was Nelson Mandela, and one of Albertina&#x27;s bridesmaids was Mandela&#x27;s first wife, Evelyn Mase; Mase was Walter&#x27;s maternal cousin and had met Mandela at the Sisulus&#x27; home. During reception speeches by A. B. Xuma and Anton Lembede, Lembede warned Albertina that, &quot;You are marrying a man who is already married to the nation&quot;. Walter later recalled, &quot;I told her it was useless buying new furniture. I was going to be in jail.&quot; They did not have a honeymoon until November 1990, when they travelled together to the Crimean resort of Yalta on ANC business.

The Sisulus&#x27; four-room home in Orlando West accommodated a rotation of young relatives, including Sisulu&#x27;s younger siblings and five children of their own born between August 1945 and October 1957, and Sisulu raised them alone while Walter was on Robben Island from 1964 to 1989. In the early years of Walter&#x27;s imprisonment, she spent her spare time sewing, knitting, and reselling eggs to raise money to cover her children&#x27;s school tuition, determined that they should attend boarding school in neighbouring Swaziland rather than join the South African Bantu Education system. 

From their young adulthood onwards, the children were also periodically detained and banned by the apartheid police between stints in exile with the ANC. While Sisulu and her son were both banned in the 1980s, they received special police authorisation to be allowed to speak to each other, in exception to provisions that criminalised gatherings between banned individuals; since they lived in the same Soweto home, Sisulu dismissed the rule as &quot;nonsense&quot;, joking, &quot;What was I supposed to do? Not ask him what he wanted for breakfast?&quot; This notwithstanding, she later said that above all else it was her children&#x27;s detentions that made her feel &quot;that the Boers were breaking me at the knees.&quot;

Sisulu was rarely able to travel to Cape Town to visit her husband on Robben Island, but Ruth First said of their marriage in 1982 that, &quot;His capacity to lead and her political strength are... the product of a good marriage, a good political marriage, but a good marriage, one that is based on genuine equality and on shared commitment.&quot; Sisulu herself famously said, &quot;We loved each other very much. We were like two chickens. One always walking behind the other.&quot; On another occasion, she reflected:[Y]ou know, of all the people around here, he’s the only one – perhaps there are one or two – who are progressive. I was emancipated the day I got married. There was no question of &#x27;Go and make tea&#x27; or &#x27;Polish my shoes.&#x27; He used to wash his children and put them to bed. You know, I never felt I was a woman in the house.On 10 October 1989, Sisulu was visiting Mandela at Victor Verster Prison when she learned of her husband&#x27;s impending release through an SABC broadcast. His health had deteriorated in prison and when Sisulu was nominated to stand for Parliament in 1994, Mandela suggested that she might decline the nomination in order to care for Walter. Her children were so incensed by the suggestion that Mandela called to apologise to them and rescind his advice. The couple lived in Orlando until after her retirement, when they moved to the Johannesburg suburb of Linden. Walter died at home on 5 May 2003 in Sisulu&#x27;s presence. At his funeral, one of their granddaughters read a poem written by Sisulu, entitled, &quot;Walter, what do I do without you?&quot;.

The Sisulus&#x27; children also went on to hold positions of influence in post-apartheid South Africa. Their biological children were Max (born August 1945), Mlungisi (born November 1948; died October 2015), Zwelakhe (born December 1950, during an ANC national conference; died October 2012), Lindiwe (born May 1954), and Nonkululeko (born October 1957). Max&#x27;s wife, Elinor Sisulu, published a biography of her parents-in-law in 2002 entitled &quot;Walter and Albertina Sisulu: In Our Lifetime&quot;. The Sisulus also adopted Walter&#x27;s sister&#x27;s two children, Gerald and Beryl Lockman (born in December 1944 and March 1949 respectively), and raised the son of Walter&#x27;s cousin, Jongumzi Sisulu (born 1958). At the time of her death, Sisulu had 26 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Despite her former Catholicism, she raised her children in the Anglican Church at the wishes of Walter&#x27;s mother; by 1992, however, when asked whether she and Walter were still practising Christians, she replied, &quot;There’s no time, my dear&quot;.

==Death and funeral==
Sisulu died unexpectedly at her home in Linden on 2 June 2011, aged 92. She was watching television with two of her grandchildren when she had a coughing fit and lost consciousness; paramedics were not able to revive her. She was buried on 11 June next to her husband&#x27;s grave in Croesus Cemetery in Newclare, Johannesburg.

Obituaries and tributes to Sisulu celebrated her as the mother of the nation. In his own statement, President Jacob Zuma said that, &quot;Mama Sisulu has, over the decades, been a pillar of strength not only for the Sisulu family but also the entire liberation movement, as she reared, counselled, nursed and educated most of the leaders and founders of the democratic South Africa&quot;. He also announced that Sisulu would receive a state funeral, and that the national flag would be flown at half-mast from 4 June until the day of her burial on 11 June. 

Memorial services were held throughout the week, followed on 11 June by the official funeral at Soweto&#x27;s Orlando Stadium. President Zuma delivered a eulogy, after leading the crowd in verses of struggle song &quot;Thina Sizwe&quot;, and Graça Machel read a message from former President Mandela which heralded Sisulu as his &quot;beloved sister&quot; and as the &quot;mother of all our people&quot;.

== Honours ==
The city of Reggio Emilia, Italy granted Sisulu honorary citizenship of the city in 1987, and the following year, the Sisulu family was jointly awarded the Carter Center&#x27;s Carter-Menil Human Rights Award, though neither Sisulu nor her husband – banned and imprisoned respectively – could travel to Georgia to accept the prize. In 1993 she was elected as president of the World Peace Council. 

After the end of apartheid, she was awarded honorary doctorates by the University of the Witwatersrand in 1999, the University of Cape Town in 2005, and the University of Johannesburg in 2007. On her 85th birthday in 2003, she was present at the unveiling of the Albertina Sisulu Centre, a community centre built by the City of Johannesburg in Orlando West to serve children and adults with special needs. In 2004 she was ranked 57th in SABC3&#x27;s controversial Great South Africans poll, and in 2007 she received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the annual Community Builder of the Year Awards, hosted by SABC, Old Mutual, and the &quot;Sowetan&quot;. She also received the Order for Meritorious Service.

In 2007, the Gauteng Provincial Government announced that it would rename the R21 highway between Pretoria and the O. R. Tambo International Airport as the Albertina Sisulu Freeway. In line with this decision, the Johannesburg Metropolitan Council resolved in 2008 to rename 18 municipal roads after Sisulu, thereby preserving the name change in the non-freeway sections of the R24 that pass through downtown Johannesburg and Roodepoort. The renaming of the R24&#x27;s freeway and non-freeway sections was completed in 2013. Outside of South Africa, the Albertina Sisulu Bridge, which crosses the Scheldt, was given its name by the City of Ghent, Belgium in 2014.

In 2018, the centenary of Sisulu&#x27;s birth, the South African government held a number of further initiatives to honour Sisulu. As part of this programme, the South African Post Office launched a commemorative stamp, and a rare species of orchid, &quot;brachycorythis conica subsp. transvaalensis&quot;, was renamed the Albertina Sisulu Orchid during a ceremony at the Walter Sisulu Botanical Garden. The national government hosted the Albertina Sisulu Women&#x27;s Dialogue in Johannesburg, and UNICEF co-hosted another Albertina Sisulu Dialogue in Durban during that year&#x27;s National Women&#x27;s Month. In 2021, the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation launched the Albertina Nontsikelelo Sisulu Science Centre, a green technology science centre in Cofimvaba, Eastern Cape.

<text>There are two types of radio network currently in use around the world: the one-to-many (simplex communication) broadcast network commonly used for public information and mass-media entertainment, and the two-way radio (duplex communication) type used more commonly for public safety and public services such as police, fire, taxicabs, and delivery services. Cell phones are able to send and receive simultaneously by using two different frequencies at the same time. Many of the same components and much of the same basic technology applies to all three.

The two-way type of radio network shares many of the same technologies and components as the broadcast-type radio network but is generally set up with fixed broadcast points (transmitters) with co-located receivers and mobile receivers/transmitters or transceivers. In this way both the fixed and mobile radio units can communicate with each other over broad geographic regions ranging in size from small single cities to entire states/provinces or countries. There are many ways in which multiple fixed transmit/receive sites can be interconnected to achieve the range of coverage required by the jurisdiction or authority implementing the system: conventional wireless links in numerous frequency bands, fibre-optic links, or microwave links. In all of these cases the signals are typically backhauled to a central switch of some type where the radio message is processed and resent (repeated) to all transmitter sites where it is required to be heard.

In contemporary two-way radio systems a concept called trunking is commonly used to achieve better efficiency of radio spectrum use and provide very wide-ranging coverage with no switching of channels required by the mobile radio user as it roams throughout the system coverage. Trunking of two-way radio is identical to the concept used for cellular phone systems where each fixed and mobile radio is specifically identified to the system controller and its operation is switched by the controller.

== Broadcasting networks ==

The broadcast type of radio network is a network system which distributes programming to multiple stations simultaneously, or slightly delayed, for the purpose of extending total coverage beyond the limits of a single broadcast signal. The resulting expanded audience for radio programming or information essentially applies the benefits of mass-production to the broadcasting enterprise. A radio network has two sales departments, one to package and sell programs to radio stations, and one to sell the audience of those programs to advertisers.

Most radio networks also produce much of their programming. Originally, radio networks owned some or all of the stations that broadcast the network&#x27;s radio format programming. Presently however, there are many networks that do not own any stations and only produce and/or distribute programming. Similarly station ownership does not always indicate network affiliation. A company might own stations in several different markets and purchase programming from a variety of networks.

Radio networks rose rapidly with the growth of regular broadcasting of radio to home listeners in the 1920s. This growth took various paths in different places. In Britain the BBC was developed with public funding, in the form of a broadcast receiver license, and a broadcasting monopoly in its early decades. In contrast, in the United States various competing commercial broadcasting networks arose funded by advertising revenue. In that instance, the same corporation that owned or operated the network often manufactured and marketed the listener&#x27;s radio.

Major technical challenges to be overcome when distributing programs over long distances are maintaining signal quality and managing the number of switching/relay points in the signal chain. Early on, programs were sent to remote stations (either owned or affiliated) by various methods, including leased telephone lines, pre-recorded gramophone records and audio tape. The world&#x27;s first all-radio, non-wireline network was claimed to be the Rural Radio Network, a group of six upstate New York FM stations that began operation in June 1948. Terrestrial microwave relay, a technology later introduced to link stations, has been largely supplanted by coaxial cable, fiber, and satellite, which usually offer superior cost-benefit ratios.

Many early radio networks evolved into Television networks.
