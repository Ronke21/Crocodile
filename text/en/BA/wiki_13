<text>August Vollmer (March 7, 1876 – November 4, 1955) was the first police chief of Berkeley, California, and a leading figure in the development of the field of criminal justice in the United States in the early 20th century. He has been described as &quot;the father of modern policing&quot;. Vollmer played an influential role in introducing early 20th-century police reforms, which increasingly militarized police departments in the United States. A veteran of the Spanish–American War in the Philippines and the Philippine–American War, Vollmer introduced reforms that reflected his experiences in the U.S. military.

==Early life==
Vollmer was born in New Orleans to German immigrant parents, John and Philopine (Klundt) Vollmer. His father saw to it that he learned to box and swim, both of which he excelled at. Upon his father&#x27;s death, his mother returned to Germany with her children for two years, after which she returned to New Orleans in 1886, but soon thereafter decided to move her family to San Francisco. In July 1890, the Vollmer family moved across the bay to Berkeley.

Before he was 20, August helped organize the North Berkeley Volunteer Fire Department, and in 1897, was awarded the Berkeley Fireman medal. He supported his mother and the rest of his family as a partner in Patterson and Vollmer, a hay, grain, wood and coal supply store, at the corner of Shattuck Avenue and Vine Street near a fire station north of downtown Berkeley.

In 1898, August enlisted in the Eighth Corps of the United States Army, fighting in numerous engagements in the Spanish–American War in the Philippines as well as taking part in occupation duties following the close of formal combat. Vollmer left the military in August 1899 and returned to Berkeley. In March 1900, he began working for the local post office.

==Law enforcement==
In 1904, Vollmer became a local hero when he leapt onto a runaway railroad freight car on Shattuck Avenue in downtown Berkeley and applied its brakes, preventing a disastrous collision with a loaded passenger coach at the Berkeley station. This event led to his election as town marshal on April 10, 1905.

In 1907, Vollmer was re-elected town marshal. He was also elected president of the California Association of Police Chiefs, even though, by title, he was not yet a police chief himself. In 1909, Berkeley created the office of police chief, and Vollmer became the first to hold that office.

Drawing on his military experience, and his own research, Vollmer reorganized the Berkeley police force. Vollmer had discovered that very little literature existed in the United States on the subject of police work, so he located and read a number of European works on the subject, in particular, &quot;Criminal Psychology&quot;, by Hans Gross, an Austrian criminologist, and &quot;Memoirs of Vidocq&quot;, by Eugène François Vidocq, head of the detective division of the French police in Paris. He then set out on a program of modernization. He established a bicycle patrol and created the first centralized police records system, designed to streamline and organize criminal investigations. He established a call box network. And he trained his deputies in marksmanship.

In the ensuing years, Vollmer&#x27;s reputation as the &quot;father of modern law enforcement&quot; grew. He was the first chief to require that police officers attain college degrees, and persuaded the University of California to teach criminal justice. In 1916, UC Berkeley established a criminal justice program, headed by Vollmer. At Berkeley, he taught O. W. Wilson, who went on to become a professor and continued efforts to professionalize policing, by being the first to establish the first police science degree at Municipal University of Wichita (now Wichita State University). This is often seen as the start of criminal justice as an academic field.

Vollmer&#x27;s courses taught how there were &quot;racial types&quot;, and how &quot;heredity&quot; and &quot;racial degeneration&quot; contributed to crime.

Vollmer was also the first police chief to create a motorized force, placing officers on motorcycles and in cars so that they could patrol a broader area with greater efficiency. Radios were included in patrol cars. He was also the first to use the lie detector, developed at the University of California, in police work. Vollmer supported programs to assist disadvantaged children, and was often criticized for his leniency towards petty offenders such as drunks and loiterers. He also encouraged the employment and training of African American (first hired in 1919) and female (first hired in 1925) police officers. This included the hiring of Walter A. Gordon, who became the recipient of the Benjamin Ide Wheeler Medal in 1955.

In 1921, Vollmer was elected president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. Vollmer left the Berkeley Police Department for a brief stint as police chief of the Los Angeles Police Department from 1923 to 1924, but returned upon being disillusioned by the extent of corruption and hostility towards leadership coming from outside the department. Nonetheless, Vollmer introduced militaristic reforms to the LAPD.

Vollmer married Millicent Gardner in 1924. They had no children. In 1926, Vollmer played himself in the silent serial &quot;Officer 444&quot; which was filmed in Berkeley under the direction of John Ford&#x27;s brother Francis Ford.
Vollmer contributed to sections of the Wickersham Commission national criminal justice report of 1931, namely to the fourteenth and final volume, &quot;The Police&quot;, which advocated for a well-selected, well-educated, and well-funded professionalized police force. Other portions of the Wickersham report were sharply critical of current police practice; one of the volumes was entitled &quot;Lawlessness in Law Enforcement&quot;. Vollmer was the 1931 recipient of the Benjamin Ide Wheeler Medal.

He retired from the Berkeley Police in 1932 as his eyesight began to fail. He was then appointed as a professor of police administration in the Political Science Department at the University of California, and went on to found its School of Criminology. He was also among the five people elected as the first directors of the East Bay Regional Parks District in 1934. The same year Vollmer was awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. Vollmer authored the 1936 book &quot;The Police and Modern Society&quot;. In 1941, he was instrumental in the establishment of what would become the American Society of Criminology, the leading professional criminological association in the world.

==Drug prohibition==
Vollmer was against police involvement with the problem of drug addiction, which he viewed as a medical and regulatory issue rather than a criminal one: &quot;Like prostitution, and like liquor, drug use was not a police problem; it never has been and never can be solved by policemen.&quot; Vollmer wrote that enforcement of moralistic vice laws leads to police corruption and &quot;engenders disrespect both for law and for the agents of law enforcement.&quot; Vollmer supported the establishment of federal distribution, at cost, of habit-forming drugs. Vollmer&#x27;s views, however, found little favor in the prohibitionist-dominated consensus of the time.

==Later life and death==
Late in life, Vollmer developed Parkinson&#x27;s disease and cancer. On the morning of November 4, 1955, he told his housekeeper, &quot;I&#x27;m going to shoot myself. Call the Berkeley Police&quot;, then stepped outside and did so.

<text>Teaching is the practice implemented by a &quot;teacher&quot; aimed at transmitting skills (knowledge, know-how, and interpersonal skills) to a learner, a student, or any other audience in the context of an educational institution. Teaching is closely related to &quot;learning&quot;, the student&#x27;s activity of appropriating this knowledge.

Teaching is part of the broader concept of &quot;education&quot;.

==Profession==
==Training==
==Teaching in non-human animals==
Teaching has been considered uniquely human because of mentalistic definitions. Indeed, in psychology, teaching is defined by the intention of the teacher, which is to transmit information and/or behavior and/or skill. This implies the need for the teacher to assess the knowledge state of the potential learner, thus to demonstrate theory of mind abilities. As theory of mind and intentions are difficult (if not impossible) to assess in non-humans, teaching was considered uniquely human.
However, if teaching is defined by its function, it is then possible to assess its presence among non-human species. Caro and Hauser suggested a functionalist definition. For a behavior to be labeled as teaching, three criteria must be met :
* The behavior of the &quot;teacher&quot; must be observed only in the presence of a naive individual
* The behavior represents a cost for the teacher, or at least no direct benefit
* The possible consequence of the behavior is a learning gain for the learner

<doc id="213819" wikidata="Q1700617" url="?curid=213819" title="John Jay College of Criminal Justice">
<text>The John Jay College of Criminal Justice (John Jay) is a public college focused on criminal justice and located in New York City. It is a senior college of the City University of New York (CUNY). John Jay was founded as the only liberal arts college with a criminal justice and forensic focus in the United States.

== History ==
===Founding===
In 1964, a committee convened by the Board of Higher Education recommended the establishment of an independent, degree-granting school of police science. The College of Police Science (COPS) of the City University of New York was subsequently founded and admitted its first class in September 1965. In 1967, the school was renamed John Jay College of Criminal Justice to reflect broader education objectives. The school&#x27;s namesake, John Jay (1745–1829), was the first chief justice of the United States Supreme Court and a Founding Father of the United States. Jay was a native of New York City and served as governor of New York State.

Classes were originally held at the Police Academy on East 20th Street. Leonard E. Reisman served as college president from 1964 to 1970, succeeded by Donald Riddle, president from 1970 to 1975.

===Era of protests and disputes===
In the spring of 1970, after President Nixon announced that the Cambodian Campaign would be extended, the college held two &quot;heated&quot; teach-ins about the conflict. Many other college campuses were home to student strikes across the nation. On May 7, 1970, the faculty voted 52–39 in favor of closing the college in protest of President Nixon&#x27;s handling of the Vietnam War and the killing of students by National Guardsmen at Kent State University and Jackson State College. But the closing of John Jay College would ultimately be up to its students, the faculty decided. At an impassioned student meeting, the final vote was 865–791 in favor of keeping the college open.

In the summer of 1970, Professor Abe Blumberg made some criticisms of the FBI and the Director J. Edgar Hoover in a graduate course on the sociology of law. One of his students, an FBI agent named Jack Shaw, examined the agency&#x27;s role in American society in his master&#x27;s thesis, granting that some of Blumberg&#x27;s criticisms may have been valid. His paper found its way to Hoover&#x27;s hands, who ordered that Shaw resign and told President Riddle that as long as Blumberg (a tenured professor) remained on the faculty, no FBI agents would attend John Jay. Riddle defended Blumberg, citing academic freedom. After Hoover&#x27;s death in 1972, FBI agents began to enroll again at the college. The FBI later paid former agent Shaw $13,000 in back pay.

===Open admissions===
CUNY&#x27;s open admissions Program came into effect in the fall of 1970. Adopting the Open Admissions policy meant that the university would now provide a place for any high school graduate who desired to attend. Across CUNY, student enrollment ballooned. At John Jay, undergraduates numbered 2,600 in 1969; 4,400 in 1970; 6,700 in 1972; and 8,600 in 1973. The size of the faculty grew by over 200% between 1970 and 1972. Moreover, the policy brought many more &quot;civilian&quot; (non-law enforcement) students to the college. The school&#x27;s massive and sudden growth had a profound effect. More of the college&#x27;s budget went toward remedial programs to help transition underprepared freshmen. In addition, the college broadened its curriculum, expanding into liberal arts. Majors including English, Math, American Studies, and Chemistry were introduced during this period in the early 1970s. The SEEK program developed during this time as well, supporting students from underprivileged backgrounds who showed academic promise.

President Riddle resigned to become chancellor of the University of Illinois at Chicago. From 1975 to 1977, Gerald W. Lynch served as acting president, and in 1977, he was sworn in as college president, a position he would hold until 2004.

As the school grew, its space constraints were felt, despite having acquired the Miles Shoe Building on West 59th Street (North Hall) in 1969. In 1973, John Jay rented the former 20th Century Fox building (South Hall) a few blocks from North Hall.

===CUNY fiscal crisis of 1976===
In 1976, City University Board of Trustees threatened to shut down the college during a time of fiscal crisis for CUNY and New York City as a whole. Throughout the campaign to &quot;save John Jay,&quot; the faculty and administration united to advocate the sentiment voiced by President Lynch in a memo: &quot;John Jay can contribute to the city as a unique resource to help solve the problems of crime, public productivity, manpower needs, and budget management.&quot; After weeks of turmoil, the college decided to trim its budget to remain independent rather than merge with Baruch College. On April 5, the Board of Higher Education voted to preserve John Jay. Though the budget cuts were still painful, the college community&#x27;s efforts were successful.

===Curricular expansion ===
In 1980, at President Lynch&#x27;s urging, the college established its first doctorate program, offering a PhD in Criminal Justice on the heels of several Master&#x27;s programs. In the next two decades of Lynch&#x27;s presidency, enrollment and the faculty grew, the school&#x27;s external activities expanded, and its curriculum continued to evolve. John Jay continued to pursue an approach to education more attuned to the liberal arts. The college supported more curricular cultural diversity, establishing an Ethnic Studies track and strengthening its Women&#x27;s Studies program. Between 1985 and 1988, as faculty pursued more research opportunities, the amount of grant money given to John Jay faculty increased by over 500%.

Again, the college felt the constraints of space, and in 1986 acquired Haaren Hall (formerly DeWitt Clinton High School) across the intersection from North Hall. After renovation, Haaren Hall was opened to students in 1988. The new hall included a spacious two-level library, christened Lloyd Sealy Library in 1991 for Lloyd Sealy, 
the first African-American Associate Professor of Law and Police Science.

===CUNY fiscal crisis of 1995===
In 1995, CUNY suffered another fiscal crisis when Governor George Pataki announced a $162 million cut in state financing for the university. The CUNY board of trustees declared a state of financial emergency. By June, in response to the threat of budget cuts, CUNY had adopted a stricter admissions policy for its senior colleges: students deemed unprepared for college would not be admitted, a departure from the 1970 Open Admissions program, in order to save money spent on remedial programs. The proposed $162 million in cuts was reduced to $102 million, which CUNY absorbed by increasing tuition by $750 and offering a retirement incentive plan for faculty. (In May 1996, a State Supreme Court justice ruled that CUNY misused their emergency financial authority to lay off professors, close departments, and cut remedial aid.)

===Academic overhaul and campus expansion===
On September 11, 2001, John Jay lost 67 alumni and students, many of them firefighters, in the World Trade Center attacks. The school resumed class on September 13, providing additional counseling for students, many of whom saw their studies and career aspirations in a new light. In September 2011, John Jay dedicated a memorial to the fallen members of its community who died on 9/11. The memorial, a large steel fragment from the World Trade Center ruins, was officially unveiled in September 2013.

In 1998, the New York State Legislature had approved a five-year capital budget of $352 million for the college to improve its facilities. The college continued to expand its campus as enrollment grew. The &quot;New Building&quot;, a 13-story tower connected to Haaren Hall&#x27;s west side, opened in 2011, dramatically increasing the college&#x27;s square footage and adding green space to the campus.

John Jay joined the Macaulay Honors College, an advising program for top students, in September 2012. In December 2012, the college received its largest-ever donation: $5 million from adjunct professor and alumnus Andrew Shiva.

President Lynch retired in 2004, having headed the longest senior-level administration in City University of New York history. He was succeeded by Jeremy Travis, who was previously a senior fellow at the Justice Policy Center and had directed the National Institute of Justice. Travis retired in 2017. Karol Mason, former Assistant Attorney General, assumed the office of college president in August 2017.

==Academics==
John Jay College of Criminal Justice is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. The school is primarily known for its criminal justice studies, forensic psychology, and forensic science programs, supported by a liberal arts curriculum. The student-faculty ratio is 16:1, and the average freshman retention rate is 78%. The college offers a variety of in-person, online, and hybrid courses. There are a total of 1,100 faculty employed by the school, over one-third of which are full-time faculty members.

===Rankings===

&quot;Forbes&quot;, in its 2016 rankings of America&#x27;s Top Colleges, ranked John Jay as the 497th-best college in the country; &quot;Forbes&quot; also ranked John Jay #175 in the Best College in the Northeast category and #169 in the Best Public Colleges category respectively. In 2023, the college was ranked #4 in the US for Best Public Colleges in America by Money Magazine.

In 2016, &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; ranked John Jay #72 in its Master&#x27;s Universities Ranking, which rated universities on their contribution to the public good in three broad categories: social mobility (recruiting and graduating low-income students), research (producing cutting-edge scholarship and PhDs), and service (encouraging students to give something back to their country).

As of 2016, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked John Jay&#x27;s Criminology graduate program #10 nationally and its Public Affairs graduate program #56 in the country (in the top 20%). The same publication also ranked John Jay College of Criminal Justice #108 in the Regional Universities North Category, as well as the 34th-top public school in the same region. In an alternative ranking of the top public universities in New York for 2016, Niche ranked John Jay #9. Niche&#x27;s rankings were based on &quot;key statistics and student reviews&quot; and &quot;the top ranked public colleges are elite academic institutions that provide a good value for in-state students and offer an exceptional college experience&quot; according to Niche&#x27;s assessment.

John Jay College of Criminal Justice was ranked as the 61st-top college in the United States by Payscale and CollegeNet&#x27;s Social Mobility Index in 2015, which ranked colleges and universities on their ability to improve both economic opportunity and social stability in our country.

The college consists of six buildings. It is located in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, Manhattan close to Central Park, Columbus Circle, Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center.

The college&#x27;s newest building, a 13-story, facility, opened in 2011 and occupies a full city block in midtown.

Known around campus as the &quot;New Building&quot; it has been recognized as an &quot;overlooked architectural masterpiece&quot; by The Real Deal, a leading New York City real estate news publication, which recently listed the building among the &quot;ten best buildings to see in America&quot; and one of the &quot;coolest works of architecture in the country&quot;.

===Haaren Hall===
Haaren Hall, also known as the &#x27;Tenth Avenue building or, simply, the T building, is the main campus building of John Jay. Located at 899 Tenth Avenue, it houses the majority of the administrative departments and classrooms. Originally designed by Charles B. J. Snyder to house De Witt Clinton High School, the building was erected in 1903. In 1988, Haaren Hall was acquired by John Jay and now contains the Lloyd Sealy Library, the Gerald W. Lynch Theater, a gymnasium, and a swimming pool.

===North Hall===
North Hall, also known as the N building, is located at 445 West 59th Street, diagonally across the intersection from Haaren Hall. Prior to the acquisition in 1973, the building was a shoe factory.

===Westport Building===
Westport Building, also referred as the W building, is a 24-story residential/commercial skyscraper located at 500 West 56th Street. Constructed in 2003 by The Related Companies, the first two floors of Westport Building are occupied by John Jay. It was also the location of the John Jay branch of Barnes &amp; Noble College Booksellers, until the summer of 2014, in which the bookstore was closed as the campus switched to a digital service.

===BMW Building===
The BMW Building is a commercial skyscraper on 555 West 57th Street, opened in 1992. Located adjacent to the New Building, the sixth floor of the BMW Building houses the Academic Centers and Training Rooms of John Jay.

===54th Street Annex===
The 54th Street Annex is a 10-story building, built in 1930 and located at 619 West 54th Street. It is the southernmost structure of the campus. Some of John Jay&#x27;s administrative offices are located there.

===The &quot;New&quot; Building===
(Also known as &quot;The Tower&quot; and denoted &quot;NB&quot;.) The New Building is located at 11th Avenue between West 58th and 59th Streets. The modernistic , 13-story structure was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, and structurally engineered by Leslie E. Robertson Associates. The New Building was opened on November 2, 2011, at a cost of $600 million. The tower is directly connected to the western side of Haaren Hall and includes classrooms, conference rooms, a black box theater, a mock court, a 9/11 memorial, and an exterior roof quad called the &quot;Jay Walk.&quot;

<text>Little Bookham is a village in the Mole Valley district, in Surrey, England between Great Bookham and Effingham. It is home to several listed historical buildings, included in a large conservation area, along with Ye Olde Windsor Castle public house, Manor House School, and All Saints&#x27; Church. The village is centred immediately north of the North Downs and is contiguous with Great Bookham, the two divisions of Bookham having been made in the early medieval period.

== History ==
It is difficult to conjecture when the parish of Little Bookham was formed. The first documentary evidence can be found after the conversion of England to Christianity in the 7th century. The Venerable Bede states that Erconwald, who became Bishop of London in 674, founded the Benedictine Abbey of St. Peter of Chertsey in 666, and Frithuwald, who was sub-king or regent of Surrey, joined in the grant endowing the abbey with certain lands.

Frithuwald, however, seems to have been the subject at that time of Ecgberht, King of Kent, and the charter is stated to have been confirmed by Wulfhere, King of Mercia, to whom the overlordship of Surrey must have been passed before his death in 675. It has been stated that the monastery was first built under King Egbert.

According to a charter C.675, the original of which is lost but which exists in a later form, there was granted to the Abbey twenty dwellings at &quot;Bocham cum Effingham&quot;. This was confirmed by four Saxon kings; Offa, &quot;King of the Mercians and of the nations roundabout&quot; in 787; Æthelstan who was &quot;King and ruler of the whole island of Britain&quot; in 933 confirmed the privileges to the monastery; King Edgar, &quot;Emperor of all Britain&quot; in 967 confirmed &quot;twelve mansiones&quot; in Bocham, and King Edward the Confessor, &quot;King of the English&quot; in 1062 confirmed twenty &quot;mansae&quot; at Bocham cum Effingham, Driteham and Pechingeorde. Driteham and Pechingeorde are both referred to in the Domesday Book and appear to have been absorbed into the manors of Effingham and Effingham East Court.

Little Bookham lay within the Anglo-Saxon administrative district of Effingham half hundred.

Little Bookham appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Bocheham&quot;. It was held by Halsard from William de Braiose. Its Domesday Assets were: 2 hides; 2 ploughs, of meadow, herbage and pannage worth 11 hogs. It rendered (in total): £3.

Parts of the present parish of Effingham, however, lying to the east of Effingham Common Road at one time belonged to the parish of Little Bookham. The charters of Frithwald, Offa, Edgar and Edward the Confessor are all believed to be substantially fabricated, but probably embodied authentic material or recorded an earlier genuine transaction. These charters were probably written at a later date than stated in order to confirm a position which was thought to have existed at that earlier date. The Charter of Æthelstan is believed to be complete fabrication.

It seems probable, as the number of cottages in Bocham cum Effingham remained constant, that the later charters must have been copies of earlier charters which were not revised to accord with the actual number of cottages at any one time.

In 1951 the civil parish had a population of 650. On 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished.

==The Old Rectory==
The King and Queen of Yugoslavia were evacuated to the Old Rectory in Little Bookham during the Second World War, now partly redeveloped into six houses.

== &quot;Domesday Book&quot; record ==

The Domesday Book of 1086, which was a survey for taxation purposes, makes the first known distinction between the parishes of Great and Little Bookham, if it is assumed that there was no separate parish at the time of the charter of Edward the Confessor in 1062. As the Domesday Book makes no reference to there being a church in Little Bookham, then the church must have been built sometime subsequent to that date and that the parish of Little Bookham is likely a slice cut from the parish of Bookham. By way of confirmation of this supposition that there is no distinction between the two parishes, as recently as 1824, lay documents relate to land transactions, in which land was described as being &quot;in Great Bookham in the parish of Bookham&quot;.

The Domesday survey refers to the manor of Little Bookham being held by Halsard of William de Braose, Lord of Bramber, and the manor appears to have remained in the Halsard or Hansard family until about 1291. It would seem, therefore, that Little Bookham Parish Church was built by the Hansard family about 1100 and probably at first was a manorial chapel. It is dedicated to All Saints and is a Grade II* listed building.

== Roads in Little Bookham ==
Lower Road, Water Lane, Manor House Lane, Guildford Road, Woodlands Road, Links Way, Chalkpit Lane, Rectory Lane, Little Bookham Street, Long Meadow, Bennetts Farm Place, Heatherside Close, Fox Lane, Longheath Drive, Burnhams Road, Edgeley, Atwood, Maddox Park, Maddox Lane, Little Acre.

=== Petition to create Little Bookham postal locality===

Royal Mail do not recognise prefixes &#x27;Great&#x27; or &#x27;Little&#x27; in its published data cross referencing the optional &quot;locality&quot; line(s) with numerical subdistricts (&quot;inward codes&quot;) of postcodes, meaning that residents&#x27; addresses are incomplete when the information is computer-generated or looked up using postcodes alone.

Royal Mail are willing to update their records to add the specific localities to its data if Mole Valley D.C. and MP, Paul Beresford, need to give permission for this.

The Council have asked residents to sign a petition to show that they support this update, before they decide whether to give their permission. The petition reached sufficient initial support to be hosted at the local authority website. The problem can be overcome manually by broader postcode to traditional/main locality search boxes online.
As of April 2020, Royal Mail now recognises both Little Bookham and Great Bookham as separate localities by their postcodes.

<doc id="213836" wikidata="Q6668" url="?curid=213836" title="Pippi Longstocking">
<text>Pippi Longstocking () is the fictional main character in a series of children&#x27;s books by Swedish author Astrid Lindgren. Pippi was named by Lindgren&#x27;s daughter Karin, who asked her mother for a get-well story when she was off school.

Pippi is red-haired, freckled, unconventional and superhumanly strong – able to lift her horse one-handed. She is playful and unpredictable. She often makes fun of unreasonable adults, especially if they are pompous and condescending. Her anger comes out in extreme cases, such as when a man mistreats his horse. Pippi, like Peter Pan, does not want to grow up. She is the daughter of a buccaneer captain and has adventure stories to tell about that, too. Her four best friends are her horse and monkey, and the neighbours&#x27; children, Tommy and Annika.

After being rejected by Bonnier Publishers in 1944, Lindgren&#x27;s first manuscript was accepted by Rabén and Sjögren. The three Pippi chapter books (&quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot;, &quot;Pippi Goes on Board&quot;, and &quot;Pippi in the South Seas&quot;) were published from 1945 to 1948, followed by three short stories and a number of picture book adaptations. They have been translated into 76 languages and made into several films and television series.
==Character==
Pippi Longstocking is a nine-year-old girl. At the start of the first novel, she moves into Villa Villekulla: the house she shares with her monkey, named Mr. Nilsson, and her horse that is not named in the novels but called (Little Old Man) in the movies. Pippi soon befriends the two children living next door, Tommy and Annika Settergren. With her suitcase of gold coins, Pippi maintains an independent lifestyle without her parents: her mother died soon after her birth; her father, Captain Ephraim Longstocking, goes missing at sea, ultimately turning up as king of a South Sea island. Despite periodic attempts by village authorities to make her conform to cultural expectations of what a child&#x27;s life should be, Pippi happily lives free from social conventions. According to Eva-Maria Metcalf, Pippi &quot;loves her freckles and her tattered clothes; she makes not the slightest attempt to suppress her wild imagination, or to adopt good manners.&quot; Pippi is literate and has a penchant for storytelling, which often takes the form of tall tales. 

When discussing Pippi, Astrid Lindgren explained that &quot;Pippi represents my own childish longing for a person who has power but does not abuse it.&quot; Although she is the self-proclaimed &quot;strongest girl in the world&quot;, Pippi often uses nonviolence to solve conflicts, via guile, creativity with facts, and misdirection, such as to protect other children from bullying or excuse her chronic truancy. Pippi has been variously described by literary critics as &quot;warm-hearted&quot;, compassionate, kind, clever, generous, playful, and witty to the point of besting adult characters in conversation. Laura Hoffeld wrote that while Pippi&#x27;s &quot;naturalness entails selfishness, ignorance, and a marked propensity to lie&quot;, the character &quot;is simultaneously generous, quick and wise, and true to herself and others.&quot;

The inspiration for her father, Captain Ephraim Longstocking, came from the real life Carl Emil Pettersson, a Swedish sailor who became king of Tabar Island in Papua New Guinea after he was shipwrecked in 1904. He married the local king&#x27;s daughter, and they had nine children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jensen_5/21/2012&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Biographer Jens Andersen locates a range of influences and inspiration for Pippi not only within educational theories of the 1930s, such as those of A. S. Neill and Bertrand Russell, but also contemporary films and comics that featured &quot;preternaturally strong characters&quot; (e.g. Superman and Tarzan). Literary inspiration for the character can be found in &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, E. T. A. Hoffmann&#x27;s &quot;The Strange Child&quot;, &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;, and &quot;Daddy Long Legs&quot; in addition to myths, fairytales, and legends. Andersen argues that the &quot;misanthropic, emotionally stunted age&quot; of the Second World War, during which Lindgren was developing the character, provided the most influence: the original version of Pippi, according to Andersen, &quot;was a cheerful pacifist whose answer to the brutality and evil of war was goodness, generosity, and good humor.&quot;

Pippi originates from bedside stories told for Lindgren&#x27;s daughter, Karin. In the winter of 1941, Karin had come down with an illness and was confined to her sickbed; inspired by Karin&#x27;s request to tell her stories about Pippi Longstocking—a name Karin had created on the spot—Lindgren improvised stories about an &quot;anything-but-pious&quot; girl with &quot;boundless energy.&quot; As a child, Karin related more to Annika and Tommy, rather than Pippi, who she felt was very different from her personality. Pippi became a staple within the household, with Karin&#x27;s friends and cousins also enjoying her adventures. In April 1944, while recovering from a twisted ankle, Lindgren wrote her stories about Pippi in shorthand, a method she used throughout her writing career; a copy of the clean manuscript was turned into a homemade book for Karin and given to her on May 21, while another was posted to publisher Bonnier Förlag, where it was rejected in September on the grounds of being &quot;too advanced.&quot;

After her critical success with her debut children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Confidences of Britt-Mari&quot; (1944), Lindgren sent the manuscript for &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot; to her editor at Rabén and Sjögren, the children&#x27;s librarian and critic Elsa Olenius, in May 1945. Olenius advised her to revise some of the &quot;graphic&quot; elements, such as a full chamber pot being used as a fire extinguisher, and then to enter it into the upcoming competition at Rabén and Sjögren, which was for books targeted at children between the ages of six and ten. Critic Ulla Lundqvist estimates that a third of the manuscript was altered, with some changes made to improve its prose and readability, and others done to the character of Pippi, who according to Lundqvist &quot;acquire[d] a new modesty and tenderness, and also a slight touch of melancholy,&quot; as well as &quot;less intricate&quot; dialogue. &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot; placed first and was subsequently published in November 1945 with illustrations by Ingrid Vang Nyman. Two more books followed: &quot;Pippi Goes on Board&quot; (1946) and &quot;Pippi in the South Seas&quot; (1948). Three picture books were also produced: &quot;Pippi&#x27;s After Christmas Party&quot; (1950), &quot;Pippi on the Run&quot; (1971), and &quot;Pippi Longstocking in the Park&quot; (2001).

==Name==
Pippi in the original Swedish language books says her full name is . Although her surname – literally &quot;long stocking&quot; – translates easily into other languages, her personal names are less easily translated, and one of them is a patronymic, , which is unfamiliar to many cultures. English language books and films about Pippi have given her name in the following forms:
*&quot;Pippilotta Rollgardinia Victualia Peppermint Longstocking&quot;
*&quot;Pippilotta Delicatessa Windowshade Mackrelmint Efraim&#x27;s Daughter Longstocking&quot;
*&quot;Pippilotta Delicatessa Windowshade Mackrelmint Efraimsdotter Longstocking&quot;

==Cultural impact==

&quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot; quickly became popular in Sweden upon publication, and by the end of the 1940s, 300,000 copies had been sold, saving Rabén and Sjögren from impending financial ruin. This was partially due to Olenius&#x27;s marketing: she ensured that the book was frequently read to a radio audience, as well as helping to put on a popular adaptation of the book at her children&#x27;s theatre at Medborgarhuset, Stockholm, in March 1946, for which only a library card was required for admission. This performance also toured other Swedish cities, including Norrköping, Göteborg, and Eskilstuna. Another factor in the book&#x27;s success was two positive reviews by the influential Swedish critics of children&#x27;s culture, Eva von Zweigbergk and Greta Bolin, writing for and , respectively; they praised the main character as &quot;a liberatory force.&quot; Zweigbergk wrote that Pippi could provide an outlet for regular children who do not have the considerable freedom she possesses, with which Bolin agreed, remarking that Pippi&#x27;s humor and antics would also appeal to adults for the same reason.

Subsequent reviews of &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot; echoed the general opinions of von Zweigbergk and Bolin towards the book, until John Landquist&#x27;s criticism in an August 1946 piece published in , titled &quot;BAD AND PRIZEWINNING.&quot; Landquist, who worked as a professor at Lund University, argued that the book was badly done, harmful to children, and that Pippi herself was mentally disturbed. Further criticism of Pippi&#x27;s supposedly &quot;unnatural&quot; and harmful behavior followed in an article in the teachers&#x27; magazine and in readers&#x27; letters to magazines. This debate over Pippi&#x27;s performance of childhood colored the reviews of the sequel &quot;Pippi Goes On Board&quot; (October 1946), some of which responded to Landquist&#x27;s argument within the review itself. Regardless, Pippi continued to maintain her popularity and was featured in a range of merchandising, adaptations, and advertising.

In 1950, &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot; was translated into American English by Viking Books, featuring Louis Glanzman&#x27;s artwork. It did not become a bestseller, although sales did eventually improve after the initial release; more than five million copies had been sold by 2000. Pippi was positively received by American reviewers, who did not find her behavior &quot;subversive&quot; or problematic, but rather &quot;harmless&quot; and entertaining. Eva-Maria Metcalf has argued that Pippi was subject to a &quot;double distancing&quot; as both a foreign character and one believed to be nonsensical, thus minimizing her potentially subversive actions that had stirred the minor controversy earlier in Sweden. As a result of Pippi and Lindgren&#x27;s growing recognition in the United States, Pippi&#x27;s behavior in later books became more critically scrutinized by literary critics, some of whom were less sure of the &quot;hilarious nonsensical behavior, the goodness of her heart, and the freedom of her spirit&quot; that had been lauded in earlier reviews. Reviewers of &quot;Pippi in the South Seas&quot; in &quot;The Horn Book Magazine&quot; and &quot;The Saturday Review&quot; found Pippi to be less charming than in earlier books, with &quot;The Saturday Review&quot; describing her as &quot;noisy and rude and unfunny.&quot;
An influential television adaptation of &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot; debuted on 8 February 1969 in Sweden, and was broadcast for thirteen weeks, during which it acquired a considerable following. It was directed by Olle Hellbom, who later directed other adaptations of Lindgren&#x27;s works. Inger Nilsson starred as Pippi, and upon the broadcast of the television series, she became a celebrity along with her co-stars Pär Sundberg and Maria Persson, who played Tommy and Annika respectively. In this adaptation Pippi&#x27;s horse that is unnamed in the novels was called (Little Old Man). As a result of Lindgren&#x27;s considerable unhappiness with the lesser-known Swedish film adaptation of &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot; (1949), she wrote the screenplay for the television adaptation, which stuck more closely to the narrative of the books than the film had. Scholar Christine Anne Holmlund briefly discussed the difference she found between the two iterations of Pippi, namely that Viveca Serlachius&#x27;s portrayal of Pippi sometimes took on middle-class sensibilities in a way that other iterations of Pippi had not, for example, purchasing a piano in one scene only to show it off in Villa Villakula. In contrast, the Pippi of Hellbom&#x27;s television series and subsequent tie-in 1970 films, &quot;Pippi in the South Seas&quot; and &quot;Pippi on the Run&quot;, is an &quot;abnormal, even otherworldly,&quot; periodically gender-defying bohemian reminiscent of Swedish hippies. Holmlund argued that both Gunvall and Hellbom&#x27;s adaptations depict her as a &quot;lovably eccentric girl.&quot;
In the twenty-first century, Pippi has continued to maintain her popularity, often placing on lists of favorite characters from children&#x27;s literature or feminist characters. She is regarded as the most well-known of Lindgren&#x27;s creations, and appears as a character in Astrid Lindgren&#x27;s World, a theme park in Vimmerby, Sweden, dedicated to Lindgren&#x27;s works, and on the obverse of the Swedish 20 kronor note, as issued by Riksbank. Additionally, Pika&#x27;s Festival, a children&#x27;s festival in Slovenia, borrows its name from her. Pippi has also inspired other literary creations: for his character Lisbeth Salander in the &quot;Millennium&quot; series, Stieg Larsson was inspired by his idea of what Pippi might have been like as an adult. Pippi has continued to remain popular with critics, who often cite her freedom as part of her appeal. &quot;The Independent&quot;″s Paul Binding described her as &quot;not simply a girl boldly doing boys&#x27; things,&quot; but rather &quot;[i]n her panache and inventiveness she appeals to the longings, the secret psychic demands of girls and boys, and indeed has happily united them in readership all over the world.&quot; Susanna Forest of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; called Pippi &quot;still outrageous and contemporary&quot; and &quot;the ultimate imaginary friend to run along rooftops and beat up the bad guys.&quot; In &quot;100 Best Books for Children&quot;, Anita Silvey praised the character as &quot;the perfect fantasy heroine — one who lives without supervision but with endless money to execute her schemes.&quot;
Pippi has been subject to censorship in translations. A censored edition of &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot; appeared in France, with changes made to her character to make her &quot;a fine young lady&quot; instead of &quot;a strange, maladjusted child.&quot; Additionally, the publisher, Hachette, thought that Pippi&#x27;s ability to lift a horse would seem unrealistic to French child readers, and thus changed the horse to a pony. In response to this change, Lindgren requested that the publisher give her a photo of a real French girl lifting a pony, as that child would have a &quot;secure&quot; weightlifting career. Sara Van den Bossche has hypothesized that the lack of controversy as a result of the censorship might be why &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot; went mainly unremarked upon in France, whereas in Germany and Sweden, the book quickly became accepted within the countries&#x27; respective children&#x27;s literature canon, even as it stirred controversy over its &quot;anti-authoritarian tendencies.&quot; In 1995, an uncensored version of &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot; was released in France, which &quot;shook&quot; French readers, although the book did not reach the cultural status as it had in Germany and Sweden.

The character has also centered in debates about how to handle potentially offensive racial language in children&#x27;s literature. In 2014, the Swedish public broadcaster SVT edited the 1969 television adaptation of &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot; with the approval of Astrid Lindgren&#x27;s heirs: the first edit removed Pippi&#x27;s reference to her father as &quot;King of the Negroes,&quot; a term now offensive in Sweden; and the second eliminated Pippi slanting her eyes, although it kept her pretending to sing in &quot;Chinese&quot;. These changes received a backlash: of the first 25,000 Swedish readers polled by the &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; on Facebook, eighty-one percent disagreed with the idea of removing outdated racial language and notions from &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot;, and the columnist Erik Helmerson of &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; labelled the changes as censorship. One of Lindgren&#x27;s grandchildren, Nils Nyman, defended the edits, arguing that to not do so might have diluted Pippi&#x27;s message of female empowerment.

<text>The Academy of Country Music (ACM) was founded in 1964 in Los Angeles, California as the Country &amp; Western Music Academy. Among the founders were Eddie Miller, Tommy Wiggins, and Mickey and Chris Christensen. They wanted to promote country music in the western 13 states with the support of artists based on the West Coast. Artists such as Johnny Bond, Glen Campbell, Merle Haggard, Roger Miller and others influenced them. A board of directors was formed to govern the academy in 1965.

==History and mission==
The Country Music Academy (Academy of Country Music) was founded in 1964 on the west coast of USA. The Academy sought to promote country/western music in the western states; this was in contrast to the Country Music Association, based in Nashville, Tennessee (then the center of the pop-oriented Nashville sound). During the early 1970s, the organization changed its name to the Academy of Country and Western Music and finally to the Academy of Country Music to avoid confusion about whether the organization was a school. Being based in the West, its early membership was largely composed of those country performers based there. This is evidenced by the early awards shows being dominated by Bakersfield artists Buck and Bonnie Owens, and Merle Haggard. Due to the convergence of country and western music into one genre in the late 20th century, the Academy and the Association no longer have a significant distinction in the artists each organization promotes and recognizes.

At the first ceremony held in 1966 (thus predating its Nashville counterpart&#x27;s award ceremony by a year), honoring the industry and artist from the previous year. This ceremony was the first awards ceremony in country music. Winners from the first ceremony included Kay Adams, Merle Haggard, Bonnie Owens and Buck Owens. Fran Boyd, the first paid employee wife of the late Bill Boyd previous President, created the original signature “hat” trophy. A different, stylized version is used today. During this time, they expanded the efforts by sponsoring “Country Music Caravan” in Los Angeles and promoting their events (also held in Los Angeles) to benefit Prisoners of War and many more benefit golf events to support those in need.

There were many different presidents, CEO and boards, staff members, of the organization nominated and voted on by the membership. The voting was by membership also for the awards and most of the early awards shows were held in CA until a new group took over the running of the organization. Then they moved their annual TV awards broadcasts to Las Vegas, Nevada while maintaining an office space in Encino, California.

Under the leadership of CEO Damon Whiteside the Academy moved its office space to Nashville, Tennessee and closed its West Coast Presence. The awards show has since moved to Frisco, Texas in collaboration with the Dallas Cowboys.

==Awards==

The awards are “dedicated to honoring and showcasing the biggest names and emerging talent in the country music industry.” Typically, the ACM Awards are presented in April or May and recognize the achievements from the previous year.
The most prestigious awards are for Artist of the Decade and Entertainer of the Year as well as Pioneer. There are a number of other awards to recognize male and female vocalists, albums, videos, songs and musicians.

<doc id="213841" wikidata="Q420604" url="?curid=213841" title="Phenylalanine hydroxylase">
<text>Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydroxylation of the aromatic side-chain of phenylalanine to generate tyrosine. PAH is one of three members of the biopterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, a class of monooxygenase that uses tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4, a pteridine cofactor) and a non-heme iron for catalysis. During the reaction, molecular oxygen is heterolytically cleaved with sequential incorporation of one oxygen atom into BH4 and phenylalanine substrate. In humans, mutations in its encoding gene, &quot;PAH&quot;, can lead to the metabolic disorder phenylketonuria.

==Enzyme mechanism==
The reaction is thought to proceed through the following steps:

# formation of a Fe(II)-O-O-BH4 bridge.
# heterolytic cleavage of the O-O bond to yield the ferryl oxo hydroxylating intermediate Fe(IV)=O
# attack on Fe(IV)=O to hydroxylate phenylalanine substrate to tyrosine.

Formation and cleavage of the iron-peroxypterin bridge. Although evidence strongly supports Fe(IV)=O as the hydroxylating intermediate, the mechanistic details underlying the formation of the Fe(II)-O-O-BH4 bridge prior to heterolytic cleavage remain controversial. Two pathways have been proposed based on models that differ in the proximity of the iron to the pterin cofactor and the number of water molecules assumed to be iron-coordinated during catalysis. According to one model, an iron dioxygen complex is initially formed and stabilized as a resonance hybrid of Fe2+O2 and Fe3+O2−. The activated O2 then attacks BH4, forming a transition state characterized by charge separation between the electron-deficient pterin ring and the electron-rich dioxygen species. The Fe(II)-O-O-BH4 bridge is subsequently formed. On the other hand, formation of this bridge has been modeled assuming that BH4 is located in iron&#x27;s first coordination shell and that the iron is not coordinated to any water molecules. This model predicts a different mechanism involving a pterin radical and superoxide as critical intermediates. Once formed, the Fe(II)-O-O-BH4 bridge is broken through heterolytic cleavage of the O-O bond to Fe(IV)=O and 4a-hydroxytetrahydrobiopterin; thus, molecular oxygen is the source of both oxygen atoms used to hydroxylate the pterin ring and phenylalanine.

Hydroxylation of phenylalanine by ferryl oxo intermediate. Because the mechanism involves a Fe(IV)=O (as opposed to a peroxypterin) hydroxylating intermediate, oxidation of the BH4 cofactor and hydroxylation of phenylalanine can be decoupled, resulting in unproductive consumption of BH4 and formation of H2O2. When productive, though, the Fe(IV)=O intermediate is added to phenylalanine in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction that reduces iron from the ferryl to the ferrous state. Although initially an arene oxide or radical intermediate was proposed, analyses of the related tryptophan and tyrosine hydroxylases have suggested that the reaction instead proceeds through a cationic intermediate that requires Fe(IV)=O to be coordinated to a water ligand rather than a hydroxo group. This cationic intermediate subsequently undergoes a 1,2-hydride NIH shift, yielding a dienone intermediate that then tautomerizes to form the tyrosine product. The pterin cofactor is regenerated by hydration of the carbinolamine product of PAH to quinonoid dihydrobiopterin (qBH2), which is then reduced to BH4.

==Enzyme regulation==

PAH is proposed to use the morpheein model of allosteric regulation.

Mammalian PAH exists in an equilibrium consisting of tetramers of two distinct architectures, with one or more dimeric forms as part of the equilibrium. This behavior is consistent with a dissociative allosteric mechanism.

Many studies suggest that mammalian PAH shows behavior comparable to porphobilinogen synthase (PBGS), wherein a variety of factors such as pH and ligand binding are reported to affect enzyme activity and protein stability.

== Structure ==
The PAH monomer (51.9 kDa) consists of three distinct domains: a regulatory N-terminal domain (residues 1–117) that contains a Phe-binding ACT subdomain, the catalytic domain (residues 118–427), and a C-terminal domain (residues 428–453) responsible for oligomerization of identical monomers. Extensive crystallographic analysis has been performed, especially on the pterin- and iron-coordinated catalytic domain to examine the active site. The structure of the N-terminal regulatory domain has also been determined, and together with the solved structure of the homologous tyrosine hydroxylase C-terminal tetramerization domain, a structural model of tetrameric PAH was proposed. Using X-ray crystallography, the structure of full-length rat PAH was determined experimentally and showed the auto-inhibited, or resting-state form of the enzyme. The resting-state form (RS-PAH) is architecturally distinct from the activated form (A-PAH). A full-length structure of A-PAH is currently lacking, but the Phe stabilized ACT-ACT interface that is characteristic of A-PAH has been determined and a structural model of A-PAH based on SAXS analysis has been proposed.

=== Catalytic domain ===
Solved crystal structures of the catalytic domain indicate that the active site consists of an open and spacious pocket lined primarily by hydrophobic residues, though three glutamic acid residues, two histidines, and a tyrosine are also present and iron-binding. Contradictory evidence exists about the coordination state of the ferrous atom and its proximity to BH4 within the active site. According to crystallographic analysis, Fe(II) is coordinated by water, His285, His290, and Glu330 (a 2-his-1-carboxylate facial triad arrangement) with octahedral geometry. Inclusion of a Phe analogue in the crystal structure changes both iron from a six- to a five-coordinated state involving a single water molecule and bidentate coordination to Glu330 and opening a site for oxygen to bind. BH4 is concomitantly shifted toward the iron atom, although the pterin cofactor remains in the second coordination sphere. On the other hand, a competing model based on NMR and molecular modeling analyses suggests that all coordinated water molecules are forced out of the active site during the catalytic cycle while BH4 becomes directly coordinated to iron. As discussed above, resolving this discrepancy will be important for determining the exact mechanism of PAH catalysis.

=== N-terminal regulatory domain ===
The regulatory nature of the N-terminal domain (residues 1–117) is conferred by its structural flexibility. Hydrogen/deuterium exchanges analysis indicates that allosteric binding of Phe globally alters the conformation of PAH such that the active site is less occluded as the interface between the regulatory and catalytic domains is increasingly exposed to solvent. This observation is consistent with kinetic studies, which show an initially low rate of tyrosine formation for full-length PAH. This lag time is not observed, however, for a truncated PAH lacking the N-terminal domain or if the full-length enzyme is pre-incubated with Phe. Deletion of the N-terminal domain also eliminates the lag time while increasing the affinity for Phe by nearly two-fold; no difference is observed in the Vmax or Km for the tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor. Additional regulation is provided by Ser16; phosphorylation of this residue does not alter enzyme conformation but does reduce the concentration of Phe required for allosteric activation. This N-terminal regulatory domain is not observed in bacterial PAHs but shows considerable structural homology to the regulatory domain of phosphogylcerate dehydrogenase, an enzyme in the serine biosynthetic pathway.

=== Tetramerization domain ===
Prokaryotic PAH is monomeric, whereas eukaryotic PAH exists in an equilibrium between homotetrameric and homodimeric forms. The dimerization interface is composed of symmetry-related loops that link identical monomers, while the overlapping C-terminal tetramerization domain mediates the association of conformationally distinct dimers that are characterized by a different relative orientation of the catalytic and tetramerization domains (Flatmark, Erlandsen). The resulting distortion of the tetramer symmetry is evident in the differential surface area of the dimerization interfaces and distinguishes PAH from the tetramerically symmetrical tyrosine hydroxylase. A domain-swapping mechanism has been proposed to mediate formation of the tetramer from dimers, in which C-terminal alpha-helixes mutually alter their conformation around a flexible C-terminal five-residue hinge region to form a coiled-coil structure, shifting equilibrium toward the tetrameric form. Although both the homodimeric and homotetrameric forms of PAH are catalytically active, the two exhibit differential kinetics and regulation. In addition to reduced catalytic efficiency, the dimer does not display positive cooperativity toward L-Phe (which at high concentrations activates the enzyme), suggesting that L-Phe allosterically regulates PAH by influencing dimer-dimer interaction.

== Biological function ==
PAH is a critical enzyme in phenylalanine metabolism and catalyzes the rate-limiting step in its complete catabolism to carbon dioxide and water. Regulation of flux through phenylalanine-associated pathways is critical in mammalian metabolism, as evidenced by the toxicity of high plasma levels of this amino acid observed in phenylketonuria (see below). The principal source of phenylalanine is ingested proteins, but relatively little of this pool is used for protein synthesis. Instead, the majority of ingested phenylalanine is catabolized through PAH to form tyrosine; addition of the hydroxyl group allows for the benzene ring to be broken in subsequent catabolic steps. Transamination to phenylpyruvate, whose metabolites are excreted in the urine, represents another pathway of phenylalanine turnover, but catabolism through PAH predominates.

In humans, this enzyme is expressed both in the liver and the kidney, and there is some indication that it may be differentially regulated in these tissues. PAH is unusual among the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases for its involvement in catabolism; tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases, on the other hand, are primarily expressed in the central nervous system and catalyze rate-limiting steps in neurotransmitter/hormone biosynthesis.

== Disease relevance ==
Deficiency in PAH activity due to mutations in &quot;PAH&quot; causes hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), and when blood phenylalanine levels increase above 20 times the normal concentration, the metabolic disease phenylketonuria (PKU) results. PKU is both genotypically and phenotypically heterogeneous: Over 300 distinct pathogenic variants have been identified, the majority of which correspond to missense mutations that map to the catalytic domain. When a cohort of identified PAH mutants were expressed in recombinant systems, the enzymes displayed altered kinetic behavior and/or reduced stability, consistent with structural mapping of these mutations to both the catalytic and tetramerization domains of the enzyme. BH44 has been administered as a pharmacological treatment and has been shown to reduce blood levels of phenylalanine for a segment of PKU patients whose genotypes lead to some residual PAH activity but have no defect in BH44 synthesis or regeneration. Follow-up studies suggest that in the case of certain PAH mutants, excess BH44 acts as a pharmacological chaperone to stabilize mutant enzymes with disrupted tetramer assembly and increased sensitivity to proteolytic cleavage and aggregation. Mutations that have been identified in the PAH locus are documented at the Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Locus Knowledgbase (PAHdb, https://web.archive.org/web/20130718162051/http://www.pahdb.mcgill.ca/).

Since phenylketonuria can cause irreversible damage, it is imperative that deficiencies in the phenylalanine hydroxylase are determined early on in development. Originally, this was done using a bacterial inhibition assay known as the Guthrie Test. Now, PKU is part of newborn screening in many countries, and elevated phenylalanine levels are identified shortly after birth by measurement with tandem mass spectrometry. Placing the individual on a low phenylalanine, high tyrosine diet can help prevent any long-term damage to their development.

== PAH Knock-out Model ==
The first attempt at creating a &quot;Pah&quot;-KO mouse model was reported in a research article published in 2021. This knockout mouse was created to be homozygous through its development within the C57BL/6 J strain using CRISPR/Cas9. Codon 7, GAG, in the &quot;Pah&quot; gene was altered to the stop codon TAG, depicting an intentional point mutation. Two to six-month-old, male, homozygous mice were studied by scientific methods such as behavioral and biochemical assays, MRI, and histopathology. The homozygous mice were routinely compared to control mice, age and sex-matched heterozygous &quot;Pah&quot;-KO mice that expressed sufficient PAH enzyme activity to supply phenylalanine and tyrosine levels similar to wild type mice.

The &quot;Pah&quot;-KO mouse model presented high blood phenylalanine and low tyrosine levels, hypocholesterolemia, high phenylalanine and low levels of neurotransmitters and tyrosine in the brain, hypomyelination, low brain and body weight, high grade of ocular pathology, hypopigmentation, and a progressive behavioral deficit compared to heterozygous mice. After termination of the homozygous mice, no hepatic PAH proteins were detected by western blot analysis. The increased amount of phenylalanine in whole brain homogenates of homozygous mice was similar to PKU patients. The hair coat color of both mice was dependent on the amount of melanin pigment in hair shafts; thus, homozygous mice were prone to be a lighter brown based on less melanin present. Mice behavior was tested with a nesting building assay.

This model sets up the potential for an extensive investigation of PKU biology resembling PKU patients and for the evaluation of modern therapeutic strategies for PKU treatment.

== Related enzymes ==

Phenylalanine hydroxylase is closely related to two other enzymes:
* tryptophan hydroxylase (EC number 1.14.16.4), which controls levels of serotonin in the brain and the gastrointestinal tract
* tyrosine hydroxylase (EC number 1.14.16.2), which controls levels of dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine in the brain and the adrenal medulla.

The three enzymes are homologous, that is, are thought to have evolved from the same ancient hydroxylase.

<text>The stiff-tailed ducks, the genus Oxyura, are part of the Oxyurini tribe of ducks.

All ducks in the genus have, as their name implies, long, stiff tail feathers which are erect when the bird is resting. They all have relatively large, swollen bills. These are freshwater diving ducks. Their legs are set far back, which makes them awkward on land and they rarely leave the water.

Their uncommon displays involve drumming noises from inflatable throat sacs, throwing its head back, and erect short crests on its head. Plumage sequences are complicated and aging difficult. Plumage is vital for survival because the bird spends most of its time in the water. 

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Oxyura &quot; was introduced (as a subgenus) in 1828 by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte to accommodate a single taxon, &quot;Anas rubidus&quot; Wilson, 1814. It is now considered to be a synonym of &quot;Anas jamaicensis&quot; Gmelin 1789, the ruddy duck. The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;oxus&quot;, meaning &quot;sharp&quot; and &quot;oura&quot; meaning &quot;tail&quot;.

The six extant members of the genus are distributed widely throughout North America, South America, Australia, Asia, and much of Africa.

==Species==






A fossil species from the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene of Jalisco (Mexico) was described as &quot;Oxyura zapatanima&quot;. It resembled a small ruddy duck or, even more, an Argentine blue-bill. A larger Middle Pleistocene fossil form from the southwestern United States was described as &quot;Oxyura bessomi&quot;; it was probably quite close to the ruddy duck.

&quot;&quot;Oxyura&quot; doksana&quot; from the Early Miocene of Dolnice (Czech Republic) cannot be assigned to any anatine subfamily with certainty.

<text>The Oxyurini are a tribe of the duck subfamily of birds, the Anatinae. It has been subject of considerable debate about its validity and circumscription. Some taxonomic authorities place the group in its own subfamily, the &quot;Oxyurinae&quot;. Most of its members have long, stiff tail feathers which are erected when the bird is at rest, and relatively large, swollen bills. Though their relationships are still enigmatic, they appear to be closer to swans and true geese than to the typical ducks. The highest diversity is found in the warmer parts of the Americas, but at least one species occurs in a major part of the world.

Their habitus resembles a freshwater diving duck, particularly when moving on dry land. Their legs are set far back, making them awkward walkers, so they rarely leave the water. When at rest, their tails are a notable difference, and in the water they often swim very deep-set. Their unusual courtship displays involve drumming noises from inflatable throat sacs, head throwing, and erecting short crests. Most display singly with a very elaborate and peculiar display, but musk ducks congregate at leks and have a more limited display.

== Systematics ==
One mid-sized genus and two or three which are monotypic are described today:
The black-headed duck of &quot;Heteronetta&quot; is indisputably quite basal, looking more like a typical duck-like Anatidae with a short tail and normal bill. The masked duck of &quot;Nomonyx&quot; has a more intermediate position; it probably diverged from the lineage leading to the main radiation some time after &quot;Heteronetta&quot;.

The musk ducks (&quot;Biziura&quot;), sometimes included in this group, are noted for their bizarre habitus and pronounced sexual dimorphism; they are of uncertain position and decidedly aberrant. Their anatomy is more similar to &quot;Oxyura&quot; than to the two less derived genera, but still unique in many respects. mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequence data suggest a closer relationship with the pink-eared ducks (&quot;Malacorhynchus&quot;) which if correct would represent one of the most drastic cases of divergent adaptation in the whole Anseriformes.

Altogether, however, the only thing that seems clear is that the musk ducks probably are not part of the stiff-tailed ducks in the strict sense, but rather represent a not-too-distantly related lineage that is highly convergent as regards their hind limb anatomy. These two are probably part of a very ancient radiation of Gondwanan (often Australian) waterfowl, including such forms as the Cape Barren goose (&quot;Cereopsis&quot;), the coscoroba swan (&quot;Coscoroba&quot;), the freckled duck (&quot;Stictonetta&quot;) which once was placed in the Oxyurinae, or the pygmy geese (&quot;Nettapus&quot;), but the exact relationships between these lineages remains unresolved. For example, the African white-backed duck (&quot;Thalassornis&quot;) also shows some similarities to &quot;Oxyura&quot;, but again, this may be yet another case of convergent evolution.

One fossil genus of Oxyurini, &quot;Tirarinetta&quot; from the Pliocene of Australia, and some prehistoric members of genera are still extant. Three enigmatic genera of waterfowl, &quot;Mionetta&quot; from the Late Oligocene to Middle Miocene of central Europe and &quot;Dunstanetta&quot; and &quot;Manuherikia&quot; from the Bathans Early/Middle Miocene of Otago, New Zealand, show some similarities to oxyurine ducks and judging from biogeography, the latter two may plausibly be related. However, &quot;Manuherikia&quot; and &quot;Mionetta&quot; are sometimes held to be Dendrocheninae adapted to diving, so closer to whistling ducks, a very ancient lineage of the Anatidae.

<doc id="213858" wikidata="Q244152" url="?curid=213858" title="Willebrord Snellius">
<text>Willebrord Snellius (born Willebrord Snel van Royen) (13 June 158030 October 1626) was a Dutch astronomer and mathematician, commonly known as Snell. His name is usually associated with the law of refraction of light known as Snell&#x27;s law.

The lunar crater Snellius is named after Willebrord Snellius. The Royal Netherlands Navy has named three survey ships after Snellius, including a currently-serving vessel.

== Biography ==
Willebrord Snellius was born in Leiden, Netherlands. In 1613 he succeeded his father, Rudolph Snel van Royen (1546–1613) as professor of mathematics at the University of Leiden.

=== Surveying ===


In 1615, Snellius, after the work of Eratosthenes in Ptolemaic Egypt in the 3rd century BC, probably was the first to use triangulation to do a large-scale arc measurement for determining the circumference of the earth. He was helped in his measurements by two of his students, the Austrian barons Erasmus and Casparus Sterrenberg. In several cities he also received support of friends among the city leaders (&quot;regenten&quot;). In his work &quot;The terrae Ambitus vera quantitate&quot; (1617) under the author&#x27;s name (&quot;The Dutch Eratosthenes&quot;) Snellius describes the methods he used. He came up with an estimate of 28,500 Rhineland rods – in modern units 107.37 km for one degree of latitude. 360 times 107.37 then gives a circumference of the Earth of 38,653 km. The actual circumference is 40,075 kilometers, so Snellius underestimated the circumference of the earth by 3.5%.

Snellius came to his result by calculating the distances between a number of high points in the plain west and southwest of the Netherlands using triangulation. In order to carry out these measurements accurately Snellius had a large quadrant built, with which he could accurately measure angles in tenths of degrees. This quadrant can still be seen in the Museum Boerhaave in Leiden. In a network of fourteen cities a total of 53 triangulation measurements were made. In his calculations Snellius made use of a solution for what is now called the Snellius–Pothenot problem.
By necessity Snellius&#x27;s high points were nearly all church spires. There were hardly any other tall buildings at that time in the west of the Netherlands. More or less ordered from north to south and/or in successive order of measuring, Snellius used a network of fourteen measure points: Alkmaar : St. Laurenskerk; Haarlem : Sint-Bavokerk; Leiden : a then new part (built in 1599) of the City walls; The Hague : Sint-Jacobskerk; Amsterdam : Oude Kerk; Utrecht : Cathedral of Utrecht; Zaltbommel : Sint-Maartenskerk; Gouda : Sint Janskerk; Oudewater : Sint-Michaelskerk; Rotterdam : Sint-Laurenskerk; Dordrecht : Grote Kerk; Willemstad : Koepelkerk; Bergen-op-Zoom : Gertrudiskerk; Breda : Grote Kerk
The actual distance between the two church spires in Alkmaar and Breda, two places nearly on the same meridian, is 116.1 kilometers. The difference in latitude between Alkmaar (52° 37&#x27; 57&quot; N) and Breda (51° 35&#x27; 20&quot; N) is 1.0436 degree. Assuming Snellius corrected for this he must have calculated a distance of 107.37 * 1.0436 = 112.05 kilometers between the Sint-Laurenskerk in Alkmaar and the Grote Kerk in Breda.

=== Mathematics and physics ===
Snellius was also a distinguished mathematician, producing a new method for calculating π—the first such improvement since ancient times. He discovered the law of refraction in 1621.

=== Other works ===
In addition to the &quot;Eratosthenes Batavus&quot;, he published (1621), and &quot;Tiphys Batavus&quot; (1624). He also edited &quot;Coeli et siderum in eo errantium observationes Hassiacae&quot; (1618), containing the astronomical observations of Landgrave William IV of Hesse. A work on trigonometry (&quot;Doctrina triangulorum&quot;) authored by Snellius was published a year after his death.

=== Death ===

<doc id="213859" wikidata="Q4078702" url="?curid=213859" title="1999 Atlanta day trading firm shootings">
<text>On July 29, 1999, a shooting spree occurred at two Atlanta-area day trading firms, Momentum Securities and the All-Tech Investment Group. Nine people were killed, and 13 other people were injured. The gunman, identified as 44-year-old former day trader Mark Orrin Barton, later committed suicide in Acworth before he could be apprehended by police.

Police searching Barton&#x27;s home in nearby Stockbridge found the bodies of his second wife and the two children from his first marriage, murdered by hammer blows inflicted before the shooting spree started. According to a note left at the scene by Barton, his wife was killed on July 27 before the children were on the following day. Barton was believed to be motivated by large financial losses incurred during the previous two months.

As of 2024, it remains the deadliest mass shooting in Georgia&#x27;s history.

==Events==
On July 27, 1999, Mark Orrin Barton woke up early in the morning at his home in Stockbridge, Georgia, and bludgeoned his second wife, Leigh Ann Vandiver, to death as she slept. The next night, he also beat his children from his first marriage, Matthew and Mychelle, to death. He covered them with blankets and left notes on their bodies, reading in part:
I killed Leigh Ann because she was one of the main reasons for my demise. ... I know that Jehovah will take care of all of them in the next life. I&#x27;m sure the details don&#x27;t matter. There is no excuse, no good reason I am sure no one will understand. If they could I wouldn&#x27;t want them to. I just write these things to say why. Please know that I love Leigh Ann, Matthew and Mychelle with all my heart. If Jehovah&#x27;s willing I would like to see them all again in the resurrection to have a second chance. I don&#x27;t plan to live very much longer, just long enough to kill as many of the people that greedily sought my destruction.

On July 29, Barton went to the offices of his former employer, Momentum Securities, in Atlanta. Witnesses say that Barton briefly chatted with coworkers before suddenly pulling out two pistols and opening fire. He shot and killed four people and attempted to execute Brad Schoemehl, who was shot three times at point-blank range. Barton then walked to the nearby All-Tech Investment Group building and murdered an additional five victims. Barton left the scene before police could arrive. The police searched his house and found the bodies of his family and the notes that he had left with them, in which Barton vehemently denied responsibility for the deaths of his first wife and mother-in-law.

An intense manhunt ensued. Four hours after the All-Tech Investment Group shooting, Barton accosted and threatened a young girl in Kennesaw, apparently attempting to secure a hostage for his escape. The young girl escaped and called police. Responding police officers spotted Barton in his minivan and a chase ensued, culminating at a gas station in Acworth. As law enforcement attempted to apprehend him, Barton shot and killed himself.

==Perpetrator==

Mark Orrin Barton (April 2, 1955 – July 29, 1999) was born in Stockbridge, Georgia, to an Air Force family and was raised in South Carolina. He attended Clemson University and the University of South Carolina. Back in Atlanta, Barton married Debra Spivey, with whom he had two children named Matthew and Mychelle.

Barton&#x27;s family moved to Alabama as his employer required him there. Barton grew paranoid and started distrusting his wife. He lost his employment after his performance plummeted. He was also caught sabotaging data of the company that had fired him and served a short jail term for this retaliatory act. Barton found a new employer in Georgia and a mistress in one of his wife&#x27;s acquaintances, with whom he had an affair. In 1993, Spivey and her mother Eloise were killed by bludgeoning. Barton was the prime suspect in the double homicide, but he was not charged due to a lack of evidence. He always denied having had any part in them, including in the note that he would leave behind with the bodies of Leigh Ann Vandiver and his children in 1999. Despite his denials, authorities still consider Barton a suspect in the 1993 murders.

Barton had received a $294,000 insurance settlement from his first wife&#x27;s death and used the funds to finance his day trading career, preferring high-risk Internet-related stocks. He married Vandiver, his former mistress, in 1995. His mental health continued to deteriorate, however, and he began to suffer from both severe depression and paranoid delusions. In the month prior to his killing spree, Barton had lost $105,000, and Momentum Securities had cancelled his account.

==Victims==
The following is a list of those killed:
* Leigh Ann Vandiver Barton, 27, wife of Mark Barton
* Matthew David Barton, 11, son of Mark Barton
* Mychelle Elizabeth Barton, 8, daughter of Mark Barton
* Allen Charles Tenenbaum, 48, day trader at All-Tech Investment Group
* Dean Delawalla, 52, day trader at All-Tech Investment Group
* Joseph J. Dessert, 60, day trader at All-Tech Investment Group

* Edward Quinn, 58, day trader at Momentum Securities
* Kevin Dial, 36, office manager at Momentum Securities
* Russell J. Brown, 42, day trader at Momentum Securities
* Scott A. Webb, 30, day trader at Momentum Securities

<text>Louis de Blois (October 1506 – 7 January 1566) was a Flemish monk and mystical writer, generally known under the name of Blosius.

==Life==
Louis was born at the château of Donstienne, near Liège, of an illustrious family to which several crowned heads were allied. He was one of the ten children born to Adrian de Blois, Sieur of Jumigny, and his wife Catharine Barbanson.

He was educated at the court of the Habsburg Netherlands as a page of the future emperor Charles V, who remained to the last his staunch friend. At the age of fourteen he received the Benedictine habit in Liessies Abbey in Hainaut. After his novitiate he was sent to study at the University of Louvain, whence he was recalled in 1527 to become coadjutor to the Abbot, Gilles Gippus.

Three years later, in 1530, he succeeded Gippus as thirty-fourth Abbot of Liessies, and received ordination and the abbatial blessing in the same year. Abbot Blosius was one of the youngest members in the community. During the early years of his tenure as Abbot, he bore the laxity of the monks with patience, rather than risk any internal conflict.

In 1537 Flanders was invaded by Francis I of France. Liessies, being on the frontier, became an unsafe habitation and Blosius proposed a move to the priory at Ath, in the interior, but most of his monks, being opposed to his reform, elected to go to other monasteries. The abbot, however, with three monks, went to Ath and there he at once restored the primitive observance of the rule. In spite of opposition the reform gained ground and numbers increased rapidly. When a return to Liessies became possible, in 1545, the reform was accepted by those that had remained. The observance he established in his monastery became a model for other Benedictine houses.

Though Charles V pressed in vain upon him the archbishopric of Cambrai, Blosius studiously exerted himself in the reform of his monastery and in the composition of devotional works. He died at his monastery on 7 January 1566.

==Works==

Blosius&#x27;s works, which were written in Latin, have been translated into almost every European language, and have appealed not only to Roman Catholics, but to many English laymen of note, such as William Ewart Gladstone and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

His best-known works are:
*the &quot;Institutio Spiritualis&quot; (Eng. trans., &quot;A Book of Spiritual Instruction&quot;, London, 1900)
*&quot;Consolatio Pusillanimium&quot; (Eng. trans., &quot;Comfort for the Faint Hearted&quot;, London, 1903)
*&quot;Sacellum Animae Fidelis&quot; (Eng. trans., &quot;The Sanctuary of the Faithful Soul&quot;, London, 1905)
All these three works were translated and edited by Father Bertrand Wilberforce, O.P., and have been reprinted several times; and especially &quot;Speculum Monachorum&quot; (French trans. by Félicité de Lamennais, Paris, 1809; Eng. trans., Paris, 1676; re-edited by Lord Coleridge, London, 1871, 1872, and inserted in &quot;Paternoster&quot; series, 1901).

&quot;Blois’ outline of the monastic lifestyle influenced Christian monastics all throughout Europe, and it continues to inspire modern Catholics as they conduct their lives as Christians.&quot;

<text>Jean Bernard Léon Foucault (, ; ; 18 September 1819 – 11 February 1868) was a French physicist best known for his demonstration of the Foucault pendulum, a device demonstrating the effect of Earth&#x27;s rotation. He also made an early measurement of the speed of light, discovered eddy currents, and is credited with naming the gyroscope.

==Early years==
The son of a publisher, Foucault was born in Paris on 18 September 1819. After an education received chiefly at home, he studied medicine, which he abandoned in favour of physics due to a blood phobia. He first directed his attention to the improvement of Louis Daguerre&#x27;s photographic processes. For three years he was experimental assistant to Alfred Donné (1801–1878) in his course of lectures on microscopic anatomy.

With Hippolyte Fizeau he carried out a series of investigations on the intensity of the light of the sun, as compared with that of carbon in the arc lamp, and of lime in the flame of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe; on the interference of infrared radiation, and of light rays differing greatly in lengths of path; and on the chromatic polarization of light.

In 1849, Foucault experimentally demonstrated that absorption and emission lines appearing at the same wavelength are both due to the same material, with the difference between the two originating from the temperature of the light source.

==Middle years==

In 1850, he did an experiment using a rotating mirror to measure the speed of light; it was viewed as &quot;driving the last nail in the coffin&quot; of Newton&#x27;s corpuscular theory of light when it showed that light travels more slowly through water than through air.
In 1851, he provided an experimental demonstration of the rotation of the Earth on its axis (diurnal motion). This experimental setup had been used by Vincenzo Viviani but became well known to the public by Foucault&#x27;s work. Foucault achieved the demonstration by showing the rotation of the plane of oscillation of a long and heavy pendulum suspended from the roof of the Panthéon, Paris. The experiment caused a sensation in both the learned and popular worlds, and &quot;Foucault pendulums&quot; were suspended in major cities across Europe and America and attracted crowds. In the following year he used (and named) the gyroscope as a conceptually simpler experimental proof (see Foucault&#x27;s gyroscope experiment). In 1855, he received the Copley Medal of the Royal Society for his &#x27;very remarkable experimental researches&#x27;. Earlier in the same year he was made &quot;physicien&quot; (physicist) at the imperial observatory at Paris.

In September 1855 he discovered that the force required for the rotation of a copper disc becomes greater when it is made to rotate with its rim between the poles of a magnet, the disc at the same time becoming heated by the eddy current or &quot;Foucault currents&quot; induced in the metal.

In 1857 Foucault invented the polarizer which bears his name, and in the succeeding year devised a method of testing the mirror of a reflecting telescope to determine its shape. The so-called &quot;Foucault knife-edge test&quot; allows the worker to tell if the mirror is perfectly spherical or has non-spherical deviation in its figure. Prior to Foucault&#x27;s publication of his findings, the testing of reflecting telescope mirrors was a &quot;hit or miss&quot; proposition.

Foucault&#x27;s knife edge test determines the shape of a mirror by finding the focal lengths of its areas, commonly called zones and measured from the mirror center. In the test, light from a point source is focused onto the center of curvature of the mirror and reflected back to a knife edge. The test enables the tester to quantify the conic section of the mirror, thereby allowing the tester to validate the actual shape of the mirror, which is necessary to obtain optimal performance of the optical system. The Foucault test is in use to this date, most notably by amateur and smaller commercial telescope makers as it is inexpensive and uses simple, easily made equipment.

With Charles Wheatstone’s revolving mirror he, in 1862, determined the speed of light to be 298,000 km/s – 10,000 km/s less than that obtained by previous experimenters and only 0.6% in error of the currently accepted value.

==Later years==
In 1862 Foucault was made a member of the Bureau des Longitudes and an officer of the Legion of Honour. He became a member of the Royal Society of London in 1864, and member of the mechanical section of the Institute a year later. In 1865 he published his papers on a modification of James Watt&#x27;s centrifugal governor; he had for some time been experimenting with a view to making its period of revolution constant and developing a new apparatus for regulating the electric light. Foucault showed how, by the deposition of a transparently thin film of silver on the outer side of the object glass of a telescope, the sun could be viewed without injuring the eye. His chief scientific papers are to be found in the &quot;Comptes Rendus&quot;, 1847–1869. Near his death he returned to Roman Catholicism that he previously abandoned.

==Death and afterwards==

Foucault died of what was probably a rapidly developing case of multiple sclerosis on 11 February 1868 in Paris and was buried in the Montmartre Cemetery.

The asteroid 5668 Foucault was named for him. His is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.

<text>Armand Hippolyte Louis Fizeau (; 23 September 1819 – 18 September 1896) was a French physicist who, in 1849, measured the speed of light to within 5% accuracy. In 1851, he measured the speed of light in moving water in an experiment known as the Fizeau experiment.

==Biography==
Fizeau was born in Paris to Louis and Beatrice Fizeau. He married into the de Jussieu botanical family. His earliest work was concerned with improvements in photographic processes. Following suggestions by François Arago, Léon Foucault and Fizeau collaborated in a series of investigations on the interference of light and heat. In 1848, he predicted the redshifting of electromagnetic waves.

In 1849, Fizeau calculated a value for the speed of light to a better precision than the previous value determined by Ole Rømer in 1676. He used a beam of light reflected from a mirror 8633 meters away. The beam passed through the gaps between the teeth of a rapidly rotating wheel with 720 teeth. The speed of the wheel was increased until, at 12.6 rotations per second, the returning light hit the next tooth and could not be seen. At 25.2 rotations per second, the light was again visible. This gives a result of 
, which is within 5% of the correct value (299,792,458 meters per second). (See Fizeau&#x27;s measurement of the speed of light in air.) Fizeau made the first suggestion in 1864 that the &quot;speed of a light wave be used as a length standard&quot;.

In 1850 he measured the relative speeds of light in air and water, using a rotating mirror, however Foucault independently achieved the same result seven weeks earlier.

Fizeau was involved in the discovery of the Doppler effect, which is known in French as the Doppler–Fizeau effect.

In 1853, Fizeau described the use of a capacitor (sometimes termed a &quot;condenser&quot;) as a means to increase the efficiency of the induction coil. Later, he studied the thermal expansion of solids and applied the phenomenon of interference of light to the measurement of the dilatations of crystals. He became a member of the Académie des Sciences in 1860 and a member of the Bureau des Longitudes in 1878. He died in France at Venteuil on 18 September 1896.

&quot;Fizeau&quot; is one of the 72 names inscribed on the frieze below the first platform of the Eiffel Tower, all of whom were French scientists, mathematicians, engineers, or industrialists from the hundred years before the tower&#x27;s public opening for the 1889 World&#x27;s Fair. Of the 72, Fizeau is the only one who was still alive when the tower was opened.

The crater Fizeau on the far side of the Moon is named after him.

<text>Bad Boy Entertainment, doing business as Bad Boy Records, is an American record label founded in 1993 by Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs and Kirk Burrowes. During the mid-1990s, the label signed hip hop and contemporary R&amp;B artists, beginning with the Notorious B.I.G. Following his commercial success, the label signed other acts, including Faith Evans, Mase, 112, Total, The Lox, Shyne and Carl Thomas. At its 1997 peak, Bad Boy was worth an estimated US $100 million. 

During the 2000s, the label signed artists including French Montana, Machine Gun Kelly, Janelle Monáe, and Cassie. In 2023, Combs created a successor label, Love Records, to independently release his fifth studio album, &quot;The Love Album: Off the Grid&quot;.

==History==

===Beginnings===
After his climb from a non-paid internship to becoming an A&amp;R executive at Uptown, Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs was fired in 1993 by Andre Harrell and founded his own label, Bad Boy Records, shortly after. The label&#x27;s first release was &quot;Flava in Ya Ear&quot; by Craig Mack, followed quickly by Mack&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Project Funk da World&quot; in 1994. On the heels of these releases came &quot;Juicy&quot; and &quot;Ready to Die&quot;, the lead single and debut album from the Notorious B.I.G. (a.k.a. Biggie Smalls), released the same year. While Mack&#x27;s album went Gold, &quot;Ready to Die&quot; achieved multi-platinum success. Dominating the charts in 1995, B.I.G. became one of the genre&#x27;s biggest names of the day and Bad Boy&#x27;s premier star. Also in 1995, the label continued its success with platinum releases by Total and Faith Evans. Bad Boy, meanwhile, staffed a bevy of in-house writer/producers, including: Easy Mo Bee, Chucky Thompson and D Dot—each of whom are credited on a bulk of Bad Boy&#x27;s releases during this time.

===Feud with Death Row Records and loss of the Notorious B.I.G.===

The rapid success of the Notorious B.I.G., and Bad Boy as a company, raised some tensions, especially with the Beverly Hills, California-based Death Row Records. For 3 years leading up to 1995, West Coast hip hop, dominated by labels such as Death Row, had been preeminent in mainstream Rap. Suge Knight, CEO of Death Row, held Puff Daddy responsible for the shooting death of his friend Jake Robles, allegedly at the hands of Sean Combs&#x27; bodyguard Anthony &quot;Wolf&quot; Jones. Tensions were heightened when Death Row signed 2Pac, who alleged that Bad Boy, notably the Notorious B.I.G. and Puff Daddy, had been complicit in his November 1994 shooting in Quad Studios in Times Square.

After the June 1996 release of 2Pac&#x27;s &quot;Hit &#x27;Em Up&quot;, smearing Bad Boy, tensions escalated. 2Pac was shot in Las Vegas, Nevada on September 7, 1996, and died September 13. Bad Boy issued a statement of condolences. On March 9, 1997, while Bad Boy were preparing the release of the Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s double album &quot;Life After Death&quot;, he was killed in Los Angeles, California. Their deaths left many to speculate if the coastal hostility had been responsible for their deaths. The police investigations were criticized by public and judicial sources. Both cases remain officially unsolved.

===Life after the Notorious B.I.G. and rebuilding the label===
Posthumously, Biggie&#x27;s &quot;Life After Death&quot; reached number one on the Billboard Top 200. Its first two singles, &quot;Hypnotize&quot; and &quot;Mo Money, Mo Problems&quot; also topped the singles charts. The album eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. alone, and is one of the highest selling rap albums ever in the U.S..

In 1996, Puff Daddy had begun recording his own solo debut album. The first single, &quot;Can&#x27;t Nobody Hold Me Down&quot;, peaked at No. 1 on the Rap, R&amp;B, and pop charts that spring. In response to Biggie&#x27;s death, the label rush-released a Puff Daddy tribute song, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Missing You&quot;, which featured Biggie&#x27;s widow, Faith Evans, and Bad Boy&#x27;s R&amp;B singing group 112. The single topped the charts for eleven weeks and became the hasty second single from Combs&#x27; album, &quot;No Way Out&quot;, which was released in July 1997. The album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; with over 560, 000 copies sold in its first week alone, and sold 7 million copies in America. It featured appearances from Mase, The LOX, Carl Thomas, and introduced Bad Boy signee &quot;Black Rob&quot;. Mase, Combs&#x27; newest protégé, in the meantime was immediately thrust into the void that the Notorious B.I.G. left. His own debut album, &quot;Harlem World&quot;, also released the same year, would go Quadruple Platinum. Due to the successive successes of &quot;Life After Death&quot;, &quot;No Way Out&quot; and &quot;Harlem World&quot;, by the end of 1997, Bad Boy as a label and brand name had hit a commercial peak. During this time, the label began to promote its latest signing the L.O.X., who had been prominently featured on various Bad Boy releases that year. 

Bad Boy found success with rap group &quot;The LOX&quot;. In January 1998, Bad Boy released the group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Money, Power &amp; Respect&quot; to commercial success. It debuted within the top 3 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; and was certified platinum by the RIAA. The album was executive produced by Combs and Deric &quot;D-Dot&quot; Angelettie, and featured guest appearances by Combs and Carl Thomas. That year, Combs decided to expand Bad Boy&#x27;s roster to genres other than hip-hop and R&amp;B, and subsequently signed Fuzzbubble to the label as its 1st rock act. The group appeared on the rock remix of Puff Daddy&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s All About the Benjamins&quot;, but parted ways with the label before releasing a full-length album.

In the years to follow, Bad Boy saw a commercial decline. In 1999, Mase became religious and abruptly retired from the business, leaving a serious dent in the company, especially since his 2nd album had just been released. Bad Boy found some success with Shyne, a young rapper from Brooklyn, who garnered generally mixed reviews for his deep voice and slow flow—which many considered to be too reminiscent to, and perhaps a rip-off of the Notorious B.I.G., meanwhile, Combs&#x27; later albums failed to generate the same kind of acclaim that his debut had. In an attempt to further market himself, he underwent several name changes; from &quot;Puff Daddy&quot; to &quot;Puffy&quot; to &quot;P. Diddy&quot;, to simply just &quot;Diddy&quot; then shortly Diddy- Dirty Money&quot;. But with the split of the group he abruptly returned to &quot;Diddy&quot;. In June 1999, it was reported that Clive Davis and Arista had given Combs a $50 million advance on future earnings in 1998, but Bad Boy only generated around $30 million in 1999. 

As the 2000’s emerged, Bad Boy had noticeably floundered. Many of its more noted acts would eventually vacate the label, while those who remained saw their album sales dwindle as time went on. In spite of continually releasing new material, and various attempts at building artists to the status of Bad Boy&#x27;s the Notorious B.I.G., few proved as successful as the company hoped. Bad Boy had success in 2000 with Black Rob, a New York City rapper who began associating with Bad Boy in 1996. His album, &quot;Life Story&quot;, was released through Bad Boy on March 27, 2000. The album debuted in the top 3 on the Billboard top 200, and was certified Platinum by the RIAA. 

On June 20, 2002, it was announced and confirmed that Combs and Bad Boy had parted ways with Arista Records after being with the label since its inception. Combs was able to walk away with ownership of Bad Boy&#x27;s catalogue as well as recording roster. Around this same time, Combs began overseeing the tv show Making The Band 2 for MTV, a reality music show that focuses on the development of a group act. Making the Band 2&#x27;s three seasons focused on Combs&#x27; new group, Bad Boy&#x27;s Da Band. 

In January 2003, Combs and Bad Boy then entered talks with The Warner Music Group&#x27;s Elektra Records about Elektra possibly housing Bad Boy for a reported $10 million deal. However, the deal ultimately fell through. On February 6, 2003, it was announced and confirmed that Bad Boy had signed a distribution deal with The Universal Music Group&#x27;s Universal Records. Under terms of the deal, Combs would retain 100% of the company, while Universal would handle distribution and provide marketing and promotional support. In September 2003, Bad Boy&#x27;s Da Band released their debut studio album, &quot;Too Hot for TV&quot;. The group&#x27;s exposure on MTV helped the album secure a Gold certification by the RIAA.

Southern rap duo 8Ball &amp; MJG released an album called &quot;Living Legends&quot; to some success in 2004, prompting the creation of Bad Boy South—which would eventually house acts such as Yung Joc. At this time, the label also signed a rapper named Aasim, whose Bad Boy debut album never been released.

By January 2005, Bad Boy began clashing with Universal Records. It is alleged that the tension between the two labels stemmed from Combs believing that Universal had not done enough to market their music, while Universal in turn had refused to offer more money until Bad Boy started to produce more hit records. Though Bad boy&#x27;s contract with Universal was set to expire in 2006, Combs had already began talking to other record labels, in particular The Warner Music Group and Sony Music&#x27;s Columbia Records, for distribution.

===Resurgence===
In 2005, the company formed a joint venture with Warner Music Group (WMG). This saw WMG become the worldwide distributor of the company’s back catalog of classic hits, and take 50% equity in Bad Boy Entertainment. Combs, however, retained joint control over the label and could buy back his equity stake at a later date. 

Bad Boy would also see its fortunes improve in 2005, with the success of releases from new signees: Cassie and Yung Joc (both of whom would score top five singles/debut albums). Also in 2006, Bad Boy hit paydirt with Making the Band 3&#x27;s Danity Kane, whose debut album topped the charts at No. 1 (the label&#x27;s first chart topping album since the Bad Boys II soundtrack three years prior), and spun off a top five single. Their second album, Welcome to the Dollhouse also debuted at No. 1, and contained the group&#x27;s second top ten single &quot;Damaged&quot;. Diddy also signed Day26 and Donnie Klang to the label.

However, by 2009, Combs had dissolved Danity Kane, terminating Aubrey O&#x27;Day&#x27;s, D. Woods&#x27;, Shannon Bex&#x27;s and Aundrea Fimbres&#x27; contracts. Dawn Richard remained signed working as solo artist and songwriter for Bad Boy. In March 2009, it was reported that Richard and Combs were assembling a new girl group but later formed Diddy – Dirty Money, composed of Combs, Richard and a singer-songwriter named Kalenna Harper. In April 2009, Bad Boy also signed Red Cafe.

In September 2009, it was announced that Combs would be leaving Warner, inking a new deal with Universal&#x27;s Interscope Records. Under the terms of the new deal, Combs rebooted the Bad Boy name and trademark, to be operated through Interscope. The previous Bad Boy catalog and roster, however, remains under the control of Warner.

===2010–present===
In 2010, Puff Daddy offered Mase a 1-year release from Bad Boy to settle their differences after the 2009 incident with Mase wanting to be released from Bad Boy. With this Mase decided to retire from rap for good, although he was to be reassigned to Bad Boy after his year break was done. In 2011, under his new deal with Interscope-Geffen-A&amp;M, Puff Daddy stated he was looking for new talent to add to his new Bad Boy roster. Jay Electronica, who had close ties with Puff Daddy, was originally planned to be signed to the label but had signed with Jay-Z&#x27;s Roc Nation imprint instead. Machine Gun Kelly announced that he signed to Bad Boy/Interscope on August 3, 2011. French Montana and Los also were announced as signees to the label in 2012.

On April 25, 2012, Mase featured alongside Puff Daddy on Wale&#x27;s &quot;Slight Work&quot; remix, marking the first appearance of the Harlem rapper on record since 2010. Rumors began to start that Mase, as well as singer Omarion, were both signing to Rick Ross&#x27; Maybach Music Group. It was later revealed that Bad Boy artist French Montana was the reason Mase was making his third comeback. According to Montana, Mase is serving as an A&amp;R representative on Montana&#x27;s forthcoming Bad Boy debut, &quot;Excuse My French&quot;, as well as appearing on the remix of Montana&#x27;s &quot;Everything&#x27;s a Go&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m not sure what kind of decisions he&#x27;s going to make,&quot; Montana says, &quot;[but] I would love to see him in my camp.&quot; Mase is currently resigned to Bad Boy Records but has yet to announce whether he is resigned as part of a joint venture deal between Bad Boy and MMG. He later announced he had gotten his release from Bad Boy. In April 2013, Cassie released her first full-length project seven years after her debut album, a mixtape titled &quot;RockaByeBaby&quot;, to positive reception. Rapper Los announced his departure from Bad Boy Records on March 19, 2014.

On October 5, 2015, Combs announced that Bad Boy would be distributed by Epic Records. This will mark the second time that Epic president L.A. Reid oversaw distribution for Bad Boy, having previously overseen distribution for the label 15 years earlier after being appointed president of Arista in 2000. Despite founding the label in 1993, Bad Boy began celebrating their 20th anniversary in 2015 with a 20-minute mega-medley performance at the BET Awards. It stretched into 2016, starting with the label&#x27;s May reunion sold-out shows at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, and originating the Bad Boy Family Reunion Tour, starting in North America in the last week of August 2016.

<text>Lycophron ( ; ; born about 330–325 BC) was a Hellenistic Greek tragic poet, grammarian, and commentator on comedy, to whom the poem &quot;Alexandra&quot; is attributed (perhaps falsely).

==Life and miscellaneous works==
He was born at Chalcis in Euboea, and flourished at Alexandria in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus (285–247 BC). According to the &quot;Suda&quot;, the massive tenth century Byzantine Greek historical encyclopaedia, he was the son of Socles, but was adopted by Lycus of Rhegium. It is believed that Lycophron was acquaintances with Greek philosopher Menedemus, who may have influenced some of Lycophron&#x27;s tragedies and even wrote a satyr drama about the man. At an unknown date Lycophron was intrigued by the literary movement in Alexandria and settled there. He was entrusted by Ptolemy with the task of arranging the comedies in the Library of Alexandria; as the result of his labours he composed a treatise &quot;On Comedy&quot;. Lycophron is also said to have been a skillful writer of anagrams. Like most of his life, the end of Lycophron&#x27;s life is lost to time as of now, but there is some evidence of his death. Although it is not known if he stayed in Alexandria for the rest of his life, what may be his end is told in Ovid&#x27;s Ibis, &quot;Tuque cothurnatus cecidesse Lycophrona narrant, Haereat in fibris fixa sagitta tuis&quot; (And they say that Lycophron fell in his boots, and let his arrow stick in his bones.)

==Tragedies==
The poetic compositions of Lycophron chiefly consisted of tragedies, which secured him a place in the Pleiad of Alexandrian tragedians. The &quot;Suda&quot; gives the titles of twenty tragedies, of which a very few fragments have been preserved: &quot;Aeolus&quot;, &quot;Allies&quot; (&quot;Symmakhoi&quot;), &quot;Andromeda&quot;, &quot;Chrysippus&quot;, &quot;Daughters of Aeolus&quot;, &quot;Daughters of Pelops&quot;, &quot;Elephenor&quot;, &quot;Herakles&quot;, &quot;Hippolytus&quot;, &quot;Kassandreis&quot;, &quot;Laius&quot;, &quot;Marathonians&quot;, &quot;Menedemus&quot;, &quot;Nauplius&quot;, &quot;Oedipus&quot; (two versions), &quot;Orphan&quot; (&quot;Orphanos&quot;), &quot;Pentheus&quot;, &quot;Suppliants&quot; (&quot;Hiketai&quot;), &quot;Telegonus&quot;, and the &quot;Wanderer&quot; (&quot;Aletes&quot;). Among these, a few well-turned lines show a much better style than the &quot;Alexandra&quot;.

==The &quot;Alexandra&quot;==
One poem traditionally attributed to him, &quot;Alexandra&quot; or &quot;Cassandra&quot;, has been preserved in its complete form. The first mention of &quot;Alexandra&quot; is from the first century A.D. by The ancient scholiast, whose report is traced back to Theon, an Alexandrian Grammarian (first century A.D.). &quot;Alexandra&quot; runs at 1474 iambic trimeters. It consists of a prophecy uttered by Cassandra and relates the later fortunes of Troy and of the Greek and Trojan heroes. References to events of mythical and later times are introduced, and the poem ends with a reference to Alexander the Great, who was to unite Asia and Europe in his world-wide empire.

The style obtained for the poem&#x27;s author, even among the ancients, the title of &quot;obscure&quot;; one modern scholar says the &quot;Alexandra&quot; &quot;may be the most illegible piece of classical literature, one which nobody can read without a proper commentary and which even then makes very difficult reading.&quot; The poem is evidently intended to display the writer&#x27;s knowledge of obscure names and uncommon myths; it is full of unusual words of doubtful meaning gathered from the older poets, and long-winded compounds coined by the author. It was probably written as a show-piece for the Alexandrian school, rather than as straight poetry. It was very popular in the Byzantine period, and was read and commented on very frequently; the manuscripts of the &quot;Alexandra&quot; are numerous. Two explanatory paraphrases of the poem survive, and the collection of scholia by Isaac and John Tzetzes is very valuable (much used by, among others, Robert Graves in his &quot;Greek Myths&quot;).

===Debate over the author of &quot;Alexandra&quot;===
Through most of antiquity there seems to be a mostly universal opinion that the tragedy was written by Lycophron. The only real skeptics from antiquity instead believe that &quot;Alexandra&quot; was rather written by a homonymous poet who probably was a grandson of Lycophron and lived during the first half of the second century B.C.

Many support that it was written by a revisionist. The reasoning behind this is that there are many historical inconsistencies within &quot;Alexandra.&quot; Many of the key elements of the poem do not line up with the third century B.C., notably its mentions of Rome. &quot;Alexandra&quot; takes place in the Hellenistic period, and says that Rome was on the rise to be a great world power. An example is in verses 1444-1450, in which the poet describes the Romans&#x27; successes against the Macedonians. Many historians believe that for somebody living in the second century B.C., describing the first Macedonian War as a victory for Rome is unfitting, the details and predictions for the Roman&#x27;s triumph fit better with the second Macedonian War. Some modern studies have concluded that the &quot;Alexandra&quot; cannot be the work of the third-century BC author; in one scholar&#x27;s summary of this view, the poem was:written in the immediate aftermath of the victory of Flamininus at Battle of Cynoscephalae over Philip V of Macedon in 197/6 BC. The author, whose true name and place of origin are probably concealed beneath the impenetrably enigmatic biographical tradition concerning &quot;Lycophron,&quot; probably used the name, and some of the literary substance, of Lycophron, not in emulation, but as an ironic reminiscence of the earlier writer, who had combined the practice of tragedy and the elucidation of comedy. Only on this assumption of a deliberate pseudepigraphon can the full irony of his work be appreciated.

Cassandra prophesies that her Trojan ancestors&#x27; descendants &quot;shall with their spears win the foremost crown of glory, obtaining the sceptre and monarchy of earth and sea&quot; and elaborates with allusions to the course of historical events. Some scholars, such as Stephanie West, regard these passages as interpolations and defend the attribution of the bulk of the poem to Lycophron the tragic poet. Thomas Nelson and Katherine Molesworth have argued that &#x27;Lycophron&#x27; is a pen name to signpost the poem&#x27;s style, aligning it with the &#x27;frigidity&#x27; of Lycophron the sophist.

Many scholars are certain that the Ptolemaic court would not have commissioned a piece to praise the Romans. Although the Egyptians and Romans had established a political relationship in 273 B.C., the two powers did not do much diplomacy together during the rule of Ptolemy II. Egypt became more dependent on Rome after the second century B.C. when the nation was a shell of its former self due to a series of weak pharaohs. This is why many historians believe that &quot;Alexandra&quot; was written after the military success of the Roman general Titus Quinctus Flamininus over Philip V of Macedonia at Cynoscephalae, which, if correct, would then give 197 B.C. as a beginning date or creation.

<doc id="213884" wikidata="Q352702" url="?curid=213884" title="Quintus Smyrnaeus">
<text>Quintus Smyrnaeus (also Quintus of Smyrna; , &quot;Kointos Smyrnaios&quot;) was a Greek epic poet whose &quot;Posthomerica&quot;, following &quot;after Homer&quot;, continues the narration of the Trojan War. The dates of Quintus Smyrnaeus&#x27; life and poetry are disputed: by tradition, he is thought to have lived in the latter part of the 4th century AD, but earlier dates have also been proposed.

His epic in fourteen books, known as the &quot;Posthomerica&quot;, covers the period between the end of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and the end of the Trojan War. Its primary importance is as the earliest surviving work to cover this period, the archaic works in the Epic Cycle, which he knew and drew upon, having been lost. His materials are borrowed from the cyclic poems from which Virgil (with whose works he was probably acquainted) also drew, in particular the &quot;Aethiopis&quot; (&quot;Coming of Memnon&quot;) and the &quot;Iliupersis&quot; (&quot;Destruction of Troy&quot;) of Arctinus of Miletus, and the &quot;Ilias Mikra&quot; (&quot;Little Iliad&quot;) of Lesches. His work is closely modeled on Homer.

==Life==
The dates of Quintus&#x27;s life are controversial, but they are traditionally placed in the latter part of the 4th century AD. Way suggests that &quot;His date is approximately settled by two passages in the poem, viz. vi. 531 sqq., in which occurs an illustration drawn from the man-and-beast fights of the amphitheatre, which were suppressed by Theodosius I. (379–395 AD); and xiii. 335 sqq., which contains a prophecy, the special particularity of which, it is maintained by Koechly, limits its applicability to the middle of the fourth century AD.&quot;

Some scholars suggest an earlier date in the 3rd or even the 2nd century, arguing that his &quot;Posthomerica&quot; shows an influence from the &quot;Second Sophistic&quot;, the school of Greek orators who flourished in the 1st and 2nd centuries. According to his own account (xii. 310), he began composing poetry in his early youth while tending sheep near Smyrna (present-day İzmir).

A Christian poet of the 4th century, Dorotheus, known for his Greek epic poem &quot;The Vision of Dorotheus&quot;, has been identified as the son of Quintus Smyrnaeus. At the end of the manuscript of his &quot;Vision&quot;, he identifies himself as &quot;Dorotheus, son of Quintus the poet&quot;. This identification is supported by the facts that there is no other poet Quintus in this period and Dorotheus uses the same Homeric poetic structure as Quintus.

==The &quot;Posthomerica&quot;==

The plot of &quot;Posthomerica&quot; begins where Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; ends, immediately after Hector&#x27;s body was regained by the Trojans. The first four books, covering the same ground as the &quot;Aethiopis&quot; of Arctinus of Miletus, describe the doughty deeds and deaths of the Amazon Penthesileia and of Aethiopian king Memnon, the son of the dawn goddess Eos, both slain by Achilles, and the death of Achilles himself and the funeral games in his honour.

Books five through twelve, covering the same ground as the &quot;Little Iliad&quot; of Lesches, span the contest between Aias and Odysseus for the arms of Achilles, the death of Aias of suicide after his loss, the exploits of Neoptolemus, Eurypylus and Deiphobus, the deaths of Paris and Oenone, and the building of the wooden horse. As well as drawing inspiration from Lesches&#x27; work, it is likely that these books gathered source material from Greek tragedy, such as Sophocles&#x27; depiction of Ajax.

The remaining books, covering the same ground as Arctinus&#x27; &quot;The Sack of Troy&quot;, relate the capture of Troy by means of the wooden horse, the sacrifice of Polyxena at the grave of Achilles, the departure of the Greeks, and their dispersal by storm.

==Editions==
The &quot;editio princeps&quot; by Aldus Manutius was published at Venice, 1504 under the title &quot;Quinti Calabri derelictorum ab Homero libri XIV&quot;. Aldus calls him Quintus Calabrus, because the only known manuscript of his poem was discovered at Otranto in Calabria by Cardinal Bessarion, in 1450. His familiar name was first given him by his editor Lorenz Rhodomann, in 1577, who included a Latin translation by Michael Neander.

There has been a renewed interest in the poet and his poem in the twentieth century, with A. Way&#x27;s translation (Loeb Classical Library vol. 19, 1913); a new edition of the text with partial commentary and French translation done by Francis Vian (3 vols. published by Budé, 1963, 1966, 1969); Frederick Combellack&#x27;s English translation; Alan James and Kevin Lee&#x27;s detailed commentary on book 5; and Alan James&#x27;s English translation, with newly edited text and commentary.

<doc id="213887" wikidata="Q866317" url="?curid=213887" title="Semipermeable membrane">
<text>Semipermeable membrane is a type of synthetic or biologic, polymeric membrane that allows certain molecules or ions to pass through it by osmosis. The rate of passage depends on the pressure, concentration, and temperature of the molecules or solutes on either side, as well as the permeability of the membrane to each solute. Depending on the membrane and the solute, permeability may depend on solute size, solubility, properties, or chemistry. How the membrane is constructed to be selective in its permeability will determine the rate and the permeability. Many natural and synthetic materials which are rather thick are also semipermeable. One example of this is the thin film on the inside of an egg.

Biological membranes are selectively permeable, with the passage of molecules controlled by facilitated diffusion, passive transport or active transport regulated by proteins embedded in the membrane.

== Biological membranes ==

=== Phospholipid bilayer ===

A phospholipid bilayer is an example of a biological semipermeable membrane. It consists of two parallel, opposite-facing layers of uniformly arranged phospholipids. Each phospholipid is made of one phosphate head and two fatty acid tails. The plasma membrane that surrounds all biological cells is an example of a phospholipid bilayer. The plasma membrane is very specific in its permeability, meaning it carefully controls which substances enter and leave the cell. Because they are attracted to the water content within and outside the cell (or &quot;hydrophillic&quot;), the phosphate heads assemble along the outer and inner surfaces of the plasma membrane, and the hydrophobic tails are the layer hidden in the inside of the membrane. Cholesterol molecules are also found throughout the plasma membrane and act as a buffer of membrane fluidity. The phospholipid bilayer is most permeable to small, uncharged solutes. Protein channels are embedded in or through the phospholipids, and, collectively, this model is known as the fluid mosaic model. Aquaporins are protein channel pores permeable to water.

=== Cellular communication ===
Information can also pass through the plasma membrane when signaling molecules bind to receptors in the cell membrane. The signaling molecules bind to the receptors, which alters the structure of these proteins. A change in the protein structure initiates a signaling cascade. G protein-coupled receptor signaling is an important subset of such signaling processes.
=== Osmotic stress ===
Because the lipid bilayer is semipermeable, it is subject to osmotic pressure. When the solutes around a cell become more or less concentrated, osmotic pressure causes water to flow into or out of the cell to equilibrate. This osmotic stress inhibits cellular functions that depend on the activity of water in the cell, such as the functioning of its DNA and protein systems and proper assembly of its plasma membrane. This can lead to osmotic shock and cell death. Osmoregulation is the method by which cells counteract osmotic stress, and includes osmosensory transporters in the membrane that allow K+ and other molecules to flow through the membrane.

== Artificial membranes ==
Artificial semipermeable membranes see wide usage in research and the medical field. Artificial lipid membranes can easily be manipulated and experimented upon to study biological phenomenon. Other artificial membranes include those involved in drug delivery, dialysis, and bioseparations.

=== Reverse osmosis ===
The bulk flow of water through a selectively permeable membrane because of an osmotic pressure difference is called osmosis. This allows only certain particles to go through including water and leaving behind the solutes including salt and other contaminants. In the process of reverse osmosis, water is purified by applying high pressure to a solution and thereby push water through a thin-film composite membrane (TFC or TFM). These are semipermeable membranes manufactured principally for use in water purification or desalination systems. They also have use in chemical applications such as batteries and fuel cells. In essence, a TFC material is a molecular sieve constructed in the form of a film from two or more layered materials. Sidney Loeb and Srinivasa Sourirajan invented the first practical synthetic semi-permeable membrane. Membranes used in reverse osmosis are, in general, made out of polyamide, chosen primarily for its permeability to water and relative impermeability to various dissolved impurities including salt ions and other small molecules that cannot be filtered.

==== Regeneration of reverse osmosis membranes ====
Reverse osmosis membrane modules have a limited life cycle, several studies have endeavored to improve the performance of the process and extend the RO membranes lifespan. However, even with the appropriate pretreatment of the feed water, the membranes lifespan is generally limited to five to seven years.

Discarded RO membrane modules are currently classified worldwide as inert solid waste and are often disposed of in landfills, with limited reuse. Estimates indicated that the mass of membranes annually discarded worldwide reached 12,000 tons. At the current rate, the disposal of RO modules represents significant and growing adverse impacts on the environment, giving rise to the need to limit the direct discarding of these modules.

Discarded RO membranes from desalination operations could be recycled for other processes that do not require the intensive filtration criteria of desalination, they could be used in applications requiring nanofiltration (NF) membranes. 

Regeneration process steps:

1- Chemical Treatment

Chemical procedures aimed at removing fouling from the spent membrane; several chemicals agents are used; such as:

       - Sodium Hydroxide (alkaline)

      - Hydrochloric Acid (Acidic)

      - Chelating agents Such as Citric and Oxalic acids

There are three forms of membranes exposure to chemical agents; simple immersion, recirculating the cleaning agent, or immersion in an ultrasound bath.

2 - Oxidative treatment

It includes exposing the membrane to oxidant solutions in order to remove its dense aromatic polyamide active layer and subsequent conversion to a porous membrane. Oxidizing agents such as Sodium Hypochlorite NaClO (10–12%) and Potassium Permanganate KMnO₄ are used. These agents remove organic and biological fouling from RO membranes, They also disinfect the membrane surface, preventing the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms. 

Sodium Hypochlorite is the most efficient oxidizing agent in light of permeability and salt rejection solution.

=== Dialysis tubing ===
Dialysis tubing is used in hemodialysis to purify blood in the case of kidney failure. The tubing uses a semipermeable membrane to remove waste before returning the purified blood to the patient. Differences in the semipermeable membrane, such as size of pores, change the rate and identity of removed molecules. Traditionally, cellulose membranes were used, but they could cause inflammatory responses in patients. Synthetic membranes have been developed that are more biocompatible and lead to fewer inflammatory responses. However, despite the increased biocompatibility, synthetic membranes have not been linked to decreased mortality.

== Other types ==
Other types of semipermeable membranes are cation-exchange membranes (CEMs), anion-exchange membranes (AEMs), alkali anion-exchange membranes (AAEMs) and proton-exchange membranes (PEMs).

<text>Frederick Apthorp Paley (14 January 1815 – 8 December 1888), was an English classical scholar.

==Life==
Born at Easingwold in Yorkshire, to Rev. Edmund Paley and Sarah (née Apthorp), he was the grandson of William Paley, and brother of architect E.G. Paley, and was educated at Shrewsbury School and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge (BA 1838). His conversion to Roman Catholicism forced him to leave Cambridge in 1846, but he returned in 1860 and resumed his work as &quot;coach,&quot; until in 1874 he was appointed by Mgr Thomas Capel as professor of classical literature at the newly founded Roman Catholic University at Kensington. This institution was closed in 1877 for lack of funds, and Paley removed to Boscombe, where he lived until his death.

==Works==
His most important editions are:
*Aeschylus, with Latin notes (1844-1847), the work by which he first attracted attention
*Aeschylus (4th ed., 1879)
*Euripides (2nd ed., 1872)
*Propertius, &quot;Carmina. The Elegies of Propertius&quot;, with English notes (2nd ed., 1872), London : Bell &amp; Dandy
*Hesiod (2nd ed., 1883)
*Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; (2nd ed., 1884)
*Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Philoctetes&quot;, &quot;Electra&quot;, &quot;Trachiniae&quot;, &quot;Ajax&quot; (1880)--all with English commentary and forming part of the &quot;Bibliotheca classica&quot;
*select private orations of Demosthenes (3rd ed., 1896–1898)
*Theocritus (2nd ed., 1869), with brief Latin notes, one of the best of his minor works
He possessed considerable knowledge of architecture, and published a &quot;Manual of Gothic Architecture&quot; (1846) and &quot;Manual of Gothic Mouldings&quot; (1845).

<text>Lesches () is a semi-legendary early Greek poet and the reputed author of the &quot;Little Iliad&quot;. According to the usually accepted tradition, he was a native of Pyrrha in Lesbos, and flourished about 660 BC (others place him about 50 years earlier). Proclus refers to him as &quot;Lesches of Mytilene&quot;. Mytilene and Lesbos are names of the same Greek island used interchangeably. 

The lost epic &quot;Little Iliad&quot;, in four books, was commonly attributed to Lesches. It took up the story of the Homeric &quot;Iliad&quot;, and, beginning with the contest between Telamonian Ajax and Odysseus for the arms of Achilles, carried it down to the feast of the Trojans over the captured Trojan Horse, according to the epitome in Proclus, or to the Fall of Troy, according to Aristotle. Some ancient authorities ascribe the work to a Spartan named Cinaethon, and even to Homer.

<text>Ownership is the state or fact of legal possession and control over property, which may be any asset, tangible or intangible. Ownership can involve multiple rights, collectively referred to as &quot;title&quot;, which may be separated and held by different parties.

The process and mechanics of ownership are fairly complex: one can gain, transfer, and lose ownership of property in a number of ways. To acquire property one can purchase it with money, trade it for other property, win it in a bet, receive it as a gift, inherit it, find it, receive it as damages, earn it by doing work or performing services, make it, or homestead it. One can transfer or lose ownership of property by selling it for money, exchanging it for other property, giving it as a gift, misplacing it, or having it stripped from one&#x27;s ownership through legal means such as eviction, foreclosure, seizure, or taking. Ownership implies that the owner of a property also owns any economic benefits or deficits associated with the property.

== History ==
Over the millennia and across cultures, notions regarding what constitutes &quot;property&quot; and how it is treated culturally have varied widely. Ownership is the basis for many other concepts that form the foundations of ancient and modern societies such as money, trade, debt, bankruptcy, the criminality of theft, and private vs. public property. Ownership is the key building block in the development of the capitalist socio-economic system. Adam Smith stated that one of the sacred laws of justice was to guard a person&#x27;s property and possessions.

==Types of owners==

===In person===
Individuals may own property directly. In some societies only adult men may own property; in other societies (such as the Haudenosaunee), property is matrilinear and passed on from mother to the offspring. In most societies both men and women can own property with no restrictions and limitations at all.

===Structured ownership entities===
Throughout history, nations (or governments) and religious organizations have owned property. These entities exist primarily for purposes other than to own or operate property; hence, they may have no clear rules regarding the disposition of their property.

To own and operate property, structures (often known today as legal entities) have been created in many societies throughout history. The differences in how they deal with members&#x27; rights is a key factor in determining their type. Each type has advantages and disadvantages derived from their means of recognizing or disregarding (rewarding or not) contributions of financial capital or personal effort.

Cooperatives, corporations, trusts, partnerships, and condominium associations are only some of the many varied types of structured ownership; each type has many subtypes. Legal advantages or restrictions on various types of structured ownership have existed in many societies past and present. To govern how assets are to be used, shared, or treated, rules and regulations may be legally imposed or internally adopted or decreed.

====Liability for the group or for others in the group====
Ownership by definition does not necessarily imply a responsibility to others for actions regarding the property. A &quot;legal shield&quot; is said to exist if the entity&#x27;s legal liabilities do not get redistributed among the entity&#x27;s owners or members. An application of this, to limit ownership risks, is to form a new entity (such as a shell company) to purchase, own and operate each property. Since the entity is separate and distinct from others, if a problem occurs which leads to a massive liability, the individual is protected from losing more than the value of that one property. Many other properties are protected, when owned by other distinct entities.

In the loosest sense of group ownership, a lack of legal framework, rules and regulations may mean that group ownership of property places each member in a position of responsibility (liability) for the actions of every other member. A structured group duly constituted as an entity under law may still not protect members from being personally liable for each other&#x27;s actions. Court decisions against the entity itself may give rise to unlimited personal liability for each and every member. An example of this situation is a professional partnership (e.g. law practice) in some jurisdictions. Thus, being a partner or owner in a group may give little advantage in terms of share ownership while producing a lot of risk to the partner, owner or participant.

====Sharing gains====
At the end of each fiscal year, accounting rules determine a surplus or profit, which may be retained inside the entity or distributed among owners according to the initial setup intent when the entity was created. For public corporations, common shareholders have no right to receive any of the profit.

Entities with a &quot;member focus&quot; will give financial surplus back to members according to the volume of financial activity that the participating member generated for the entity. Examples of this are producer cooperatives, buyer cooperatives and participating whole life policyholders in both mutual and share-capital insurance companies.

Entities with &quot;shared voting rights&quot; that depend on financial capital distribute surplus among shareholders without regard to any other contribution to the entity. Depending on internal rules and regulations, certain classes of shares have the right to receive increases in financial &quot;dividends&quot; while other classes do not. After many years the increase over time is substantial if the business is profitable. Examples of this are common shares and preferred shares in private or publicly listed share capital corporations.

Entities with a focus on providing service &quot;in perpetuam&quot; do not distribute financial surplus; they must retain it. It will then serve as a cushion against losses or as a means to finance growth activities. Examples of this are not-for-profit entities: they are allowed to make profits, but are not permitted to give any of it back to members except by way of discounts in the future on new transactions.

Depending on the charter at the foundation of the entity, and depending on the legal framework under which the entity was created, the form of ownership is determined once and for all time. To change it requires significant work in terms of communicating with stakeholders (member-owners, governments, etc.) and acquiring their approval. Whatever structural constraints or disadvantages exist at the creation thus remain an integral part of the entity. Common in, for instance, New York City, Hamburg, and Berlin is a form of real estate ownership known as a cooperative (also co-operative or co-op, in German &quot;Wohnungsgenossenschaft&quot; – apartment co-operative, also &quot;&quot;Wohnbaugenossenschaft&quot; or simply &quot;Baugenossenschaft&quot;&quot;) which relies heavily on internal rules of operation instead of the legal framework governing condominium associations. These &quot;co-ops&quot;, owning the building for the mutual benefit of its members, can ultimately perform most of the functions of a legally constituted condominium, i.e. restricting use appropriately and containing financial liabilities to within tolerable levels. To change their structure now that they are up and operating would require significant effort to achieve acceptance among members and various levels of government.

====Sharing use====
The owning entity makes rules governing use of property; each property may comprise areas that are made available to any and every member of the group to use. When the group is the entire nation, the same principle is in effect whether the property is small (e.g. picnic rest stops along highways) or large (such as national parks, highways, ports, and publicly owned buildings). Smaller examples of shared use include common areas such as lobbies, entrance hallways and passages to adjacent buildings.

One disadvantage of communal ownership, known as the Tragedy of the Commons, occurs where unlimited unrestricted and unregulated access to a resource (e.g. pasture land) destroys the resource because of over-exploitation. The benefits of exploitation accrue to individuals immediately, while the costs of policing or enforcing appropriate use, and the losses dues to over exploitation, are distributed among many, and are only visible to these gradually.

In a communist nation, the means of production of goods would be owned communally by all people of that nation; the original thinkers did not specify rules and regulations.

===Ownership models===
* State ownership: ownership of an industry, asset, or enterprise by the state or a public body representing a community as opposed to an individual or private party.
** Public ownership: ownership and operation of an enterprise by a central government; also an ambiguous term that could refer to either social, partial state, or full state ownership.
* Private ownership: exclusive ownership of property by non-governmental legal entities.
** Fractional ownership: ownership held in percentage shares of an expensive asset, sold to individual owners, who are charged fees for the asset&#x27;s management and variable use.
* Collective ownership: either joint ownership of an economic entity (e.g., a cooperative) or public ownership.
** Cooperative ownership: ownership by the people who together operate and trade with an enterprise.
** Common ownership non-exclusive ownership of property by everyone involuntarily.
* Property is also distinguished by whether it is movable (personal property) or immovable (immovable property and real property).
* Property can also be distinguished by whether or not it is owned with exclusive rights, such rights grant owners a monopoly to refuse ownership to non-owners.
* Concerning ownership of means of production and delineating which groups receive the direct profits, capitalism&#x27;s private ownership is distinguished from socialism&#x27;s social ownership.
* Ownership of resources can be distinguished as either as individual or communal, analogous to private or public in delineating who has rights of use.

==Types of property==

===Personal property===

Personal property is a type of property. In the common law systems personal property may also be called chattels. It is distinguished from real property, or real estate. In the civil law systems personal property is often called movable property or movables – any property that can be moved from one location or another. This term is used to distinguish property that different from immovable property or immovables, such as land and buildings. This also means the direct owner of the item(s) is in full control of them/it until either stolen, confiscated by law enforcement, or destroyed.

Personal property may be classified in a variety of ways, such as goods, money, negotiable instruments, securities, and intangible assets including choses in action.

===Land ownership===

Real estate or immovable property is a legal term (in some jurisdictions) that encompasses land along with anything permanently affixed to the land, such as buildings. Real estate (immovable property) is often considered synonymous with real property, in contrast from personal property (also sometimes called &quot;chattel&quot; or &quot;personalty&quot;). However, for technical purposes, some people prefer to distinguish real estate, referring to the land and fixtures themselves, from real property, referring to ownership rights over real estate. The terms &quot;real estate&quot; and &quot;real property&quot; are used primarily in common law, while civil law jurisdictions refer instead to immovable property.

In law, the word &quot;real&quot; means relating to a thing (from Latin &quot;reālis,&quot; ultimately from &quot;rēs&quot;, &#x27;matter&#x27; or &#x27;thing&#x27;), as distinguished from a person. Thus the law broadly distinguishes between &quot;real property&quot; (land and anything affixed to it) and &quot;personal property&quot; (everything else, e.g., clothing, furniture, money). The conceptual difference is between immovable property, which would transfer title along with the land, and movable property, which a person would retain title to.

With the development of private property ownership, real estate has become a major area of business.

===Corporations and legal entities===

An individual or group of individuals can own shares in corporations and other legal entities, but do not necessarily own the entities themselves. A legal entity is a legal construct through which the law allows a group of natural persons to act as if it were an individual for certain purposes.

Some duly incorporated entities may not be owned by individuals nor by other entities; they exist without being owned once they are created. Not being owned, they cannot be bought and sold. Mutual life insurance companies, credit unions, foundations and cooperatives, not for profit organizations, and public corporations are examples of this. No person can purchase the company, as their ownership is not legally available for sale, neither as shares nor as a single whole.

===Intellectual property===

Intellectual property (IP) refers to a legal entitlement which sometimes attaches to the expressed form of an idea, or to some other intangible subject matter. This legal entitlement generally enables its holder to exercise exclusive rights of use in relation to the subject matter of the IP. The term intellectual property reflects the idea that this subject matter is the product of the mind or the intellect, and that IP rights may be protected at law in the same way as any other form of property.

Intellectual property laws confer a bundle of exclusive rights in relation to the particular form or manner in which ideas or information are expressed or manifested, and not in relation to the ideas or concepts themselves (see idea-expression divide). The term &quot;intellectual property&quot; denotes the specific legal rights which authors, inventors and other IP holders may hold and exercise, and not the intellectual work itself.

Intellectual property laws are designed to protect different forms of intangible subject matter, although in some cases there is a degree of overlap.

*Copyright may subsist in creative and artistic works (e.g. books, movies, music, paintings, photographs and software), giving a copyright holder the exclusive right to control reproduction or adaptation of such works for a certain period of time.
*A patent may be granted in relation to an invention that is new, useful and not simply an obvious advancement over what existed when the application was filed. A patent gives the holder an exclusive right to commercially exploit the invention for a certain period of time (typically 20 years from the filing date of a patent application).
*A trademark is a distinctive sign which is used to distinguish the products or services of one business from those of another business.
*An industrial design right protects the form of appearance, style or design of an industrial object (e.g. spare parts, furniture or textiles).
*A trade secret (also known as &quot;confidential information&quot;) is an item of confidential information concerning the commercial practices or proprietary knowledge of a business.

Patents, trademarks and designs fall into a particular subset of intellectual property known as industrial property.

Like other forms of property, intellectual property (or rather the exclusive rights which subsist in the IP) can be transferred (with or without consideration) or licensed to third parties. In some jurisdictions it is possible to use intellectual property as collateral for a loan.

The basic public policy rationale for the protection of intellectual property is that IP laws facilitate and encourage disclosure of innovation into the public domain for the common good, by granting authors and inventors exclusive rights to exploit their works and invention for a limited period.

However, various schools of thought are critical of the very concept of intellectual property, and some characterise IP as &quot;intellectual protectionism&quot;. There is ongoing debate as to whether IP laws truly operate to confer the stated public benefits, and whether the protection they are said to provide is appropriate in the context of innovation derived from such things as traditional knowledge and folklore, and patents for software and business methods. Manifestations of this controversy can be seen in the way different jurisdictions decide whether to grant intellectual property protection in relation to subject matter of this kind, and the stark divide on issues of the role and scope of intellectual property laws.

===Chattel slavery===

The term &quot;Slavery&quot; is commonly understood to refer to chattel slavery.
The living human body is, in modern societies, considered something which cannot be the property of anyone but the person whose body it is. Its opposite, in which the person in the body does not own their body, is chattel slavery. Chattel slavery was defined as the absolute legal ownership of a person, including the legal right to buy and sell them. Persons who were so enslaved did not have the freedom to direct their own actions, and their legal rights were either severely limited or nonexistent. The Antebellum period in the United States is considered both the worst for the exploitation of chattel slaves, and also where the practice aroused such fierce opposition and support that it led to the American Civil War.

Chattel slavery is currently (2020) illegal in every country in the world. However, until the 19th century slavery in one form or another existed in most societies and was thought of as the normal state of things; slaves of whatever ethnicity were considered racially inferior. Notwithstanding the illegality of enslavement, virtual slavery still exists in various forms today, although called by other names.

==Critical views==
The question of ownership reaches back to the ancient philosophers, Plato and Aristotle, who held different opinions on the subject. Plato (428/427 BC – 348/347 BC) thought private property created divisive inequalities, while Aristotle (384 BC – 322 BC) thought private property enabled people to receive the full benefit of their labor. Private property can circumvent what is now referred to as the &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; problem, where people tend to degrade common property more than they do private property. While Aristotle justified the existence of private ownership, he left two open questions
# how to allocate property between what is private and common, and
# how to allocate the private property within society

===Modern Western views===
In modern western politics, some people believe that exclusive ownership of property underlies much social injustice, and facilitates tyranny and oppression on an individual and societal scale. Others consider the striving to achieve greater ownership of wealth as the driving factor behind human innovation and technological advancement and increasing standards of living. Some support the latter view, believing that ownership is necessary for liberty itself.

===Ownership society===
Ownership society was a political slogan used by United States President George W. Bush to promote a series of policies aimed to increase the control of individual citizens over health care and social security payments and policies. Critics have claimed that slogan hid an agenda that sought to implement tax cuts and curtail the government&#x27;s role in health care and retirement saving.

<text>Adrian Constantine Anson (April 17, 1852 – April 14, 1922), nicknamed &quot;Cap&quot; (for &quot;Captain&quot;), &quot;Pop&quot;, and &quot;Baby&quot; (early in his career) was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) first baseman. Including his time in the National Association (NA), he played a record 27 consecutive seasons. Anson was regarded as one of the greatest players of his era and one of the first superstars of the game. He spent most of his career with the Chicago Cubs franchise (then known as the &quot;White Stockings&quot; and later the &quot;Colts&quot;), serving as the club&#x27;s manager, first baseman and, later in his tenure, minority owner. He led the team to six National League pennants in the 1880s. Anson was one of baseball&#x27;s first great hitters, and probably the first to tally over 3,000 career hits. In addition to being a star player, he innovated managerial tactics such as signals between players and the rotation of pitchers.

Anson played a role in establishing the racial segregation in professional baseball that persisted until the late 1940s. On several occasions, Anson refused to take the field when the opposing roster included black players. His demands may have been cited as representative of player attitudes by team owners of the International League (top tier of the minor leagues) when they voted on July 14, 1887 to ban the signing of new contracts with black players.

After retiring as a player and leaving the Colts, Anson briefly managed the New York Giants. He ran several enterprises in Chicago, including opening a billiards and bowling hall and running a semi-professional baseball team he dubbed &quot;Anson&#x27;s Colts&quot;. Anson also toured extensively on the vaudeville circuit, performing monologues and songs. Many of his business ventures failed. As a result, Anson lost his ownership stake in the Colts (by then known as the Cubs) and filed for bankruptcy. In 1939, Anson was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Anson was born in Marshalltown, Iowa. Beginning in 1866, he spent two years at the high-school age boarding school of the University of Notre Dame after being sent there by his father in hopes of curtailing his mischievousness. His time away did little to discipline him. Soon after he returned home, his father sent him to the University of Iowa, where his bad behavior resulted in the school asking him to leave after one semester.

==Professional career==
===National Association===
Anson played on a number of competitive baseball clubs in his youth and began to play professionally in the National Association (NA) at the age of 19, primarily third base for the Rockford Forest Citys, one of the original teams of the Association. He was a large and powerful man, standing tall and weighing about .

After being traded to Philadelphia Athletics, in 1872 and 1873, Anson finished in the NA&#x27;s top five in batting, on-base percentage (OBP), and on-base plus slugging (OPS). He led the National Association in OBP in 1872. His numbers declined slightly in 1874 and 1875, but he was still good enough that Chicago White Stockings secretary-turned-president William Hulbert sought him to improve his club for the 1876 season. Hulbert broke league rules by negotiating with Anson and several other stars while the 1875 season was still in progress and ultimately founded the new National League to forestall any disciplinary action.

Anson, who had become engaged to a Philadelphia native in the meantime, had second thoughts about going west, but Hulbert held Anson to his contract and he eventually warmed to the Windy City.

===Chicago White Stockings/Colts===

The White Stockings won the first league title, but fell off the pace the following two seasons. During this time, Anson was a solid hitter, but not quite a superstar. Both his fortunes and those of his team would change after Anson was named captain-manager of the club in 1879.

His new role led to the nickname &quot;Cap&quot;, though newspapers typically called him by the more formal &quot;Captain Anson&quot; or &quot;Capt. Anson&quot;. With Anson pacing the way, the White Stockings won five pennants between 1880 and 1886. They were helped to the titles using new managerial tactics, including the use of a third-base coach, having one fielder back up another, signaling batters, and the rotation of two star pitchers. In the first half of the 1880s, aided by speedy players like Mike Kelly, Anson had his players aggressively run the bases, forcing the opposition into making errors. After the expression first became popular in the 1890s, he retroactively claimed to use some of the first &quot;hit and run&quot; plays.

Anson shares credit as an innovator of modern spring training along with the president of the Chicago club, Albert Spalding. They were among the first to send their clubs to warmer climates in the South to prepare for the season, beginning in Hot Springs, Arkansas, in 1886. On the field, Anson was the team&#x27;s best hitter and run producer. In the 1880s, he won two batting titles (1881, 1888) and finished second four times (1880, 1882, 1886–1887). During the same period, he led the league in runs batted in (RBIs) seven times (1880–82, 1884–86, 1888). His best season was in 1881, when he led the league in batting (.399), OBP (.442), OPS (.952), hits (137), total bases (175), and RBIs (82). He also became the first player to hit three consecutive home runs, five homers in two games, and four doubles in a game, as well as being the first to perform two unassisted double plays in a game. He is one of only a few players to score six runs in a game, a feat he accomplished on August 24, 1886.

Anson signed a ten-year contract in 1888 to manage the White Stockings (which, because of a typographical error he failed to spot, ended after the 1897 season instead of 1898), but his best years were behind him. He led the league in walks in 1890 and garnered his eighth and final RBI crown in 1891. On the managerial front, he failed to win another pennant.

As the end of the 1880s approached, the club had begun trading away its stars in favor of young players, with the exception of the veteran Anson. Local newspapers had started to call the team &quot;Anson&#x27;s Colts&quot;, or just &quot;Colts&quot;, before the decade was out. With the advent of the Players&#x27; League in 1890, what little talent the club still had was drained away, and the team nickname &quot;Colts&quot;, though never official, became standard usage in the local media along with variants such as (Anson&#x27;s) White Colts and (Anson&#x27;s) Broncos.

He also mellowed enough that he became a fatherly figure and was often called &quot;Pop&quot;. When he was fired as manager after the 1897 season, it also marked the end of his 27-year playing career. The following season, newspapers dubbed the Colts the &quot;Orphans&quot;, as they had lost their &quot;Pop&quot;.

===Racism===

Although the decision to ban black players from the National League and (minor) International League was made behind the scenes by team owners, Anson was the most outspoken player and vociferously insisted on segregation even before the ban was official. As a star player and team manager, his influence was substantial. Baseball historian Kevin Blackistone opined that &quot;I don’t think anyone has had a greater impact on baseball than Anson&quot; for his role in baseball&#x27;s racist discrimination. While not disputing the specific impacts of Anson&#x27;s direct actions, baseball historian Bill James felt that this viewpoint overstated Anson&#x27;s influence; he speculated that it is &quot;enormously likely that Jim Crow would have come to baseball even had Cap Anson never been born.&quot;

On August 10, 1883, Anson refused to play an exhibition game against the Toledo Blue Stockings because their catcher, Moses Fleetwood Walker, was black. When Blue Stockings Manager Charlie Morton told Anson the White Stockings would forfeit the gate receipts if they refused to play, Anson backed down, but not before uttering the word &quot;nigger&quot; on the field and vowing that his team would not play in such a game again.

In 1884, Chicago again played an exhibition game at Toledo, which was then in the American Association, a major league. Walker sat it out, however, it is uncertain whether he did so to placate Chicago or due to injury; Jimmy McGuire instead did the catching. Both had sore hands, the &quot;Toledo Blade&quot; had said a few days earlier. Of the two catchers, Walker was seemingly the more injured, as he did not play in Toledo&#x27;s second-most recent game. Among Anson&#x27;s incidents, this one is unique in that private correspondence provides insight. Three months before the game, Chicago Treasurer-Secretary John A. Brown wrote Toledo manager Charlie Morton that &quot;the management of the Chicago Ball Club have no personal feeling about the matter,&quot; while &quot;the players do most decisively object and to preserve harmony in the club it is necessary that I have your assurance in writing that [Walker] will not play any position in your nine July 25. I have no doubt such is your meaning[;] only your letter does not express in full [sic]. I have no desire to replay the occurrence of last season and must have your guarantee to that effort.&quot;

Walker and his brother Welday were released from their team later that year, Welday last playing on August 6 and Fleet on September 4. On July 14, 1887 the Chicago White Stockings played an exhibition game against the Newark Little Giants. African American George Stovey was listed in the &quot;Newark News&quot; as the scheduled Newark starting pitcher. Anson objected, and Stovey did not pitch. Moreover, International League owners had voted 6-to-4 at a 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. meeting in Buffalo on the morning of the game to exclude African-American players from future contracts.

===Personal character===

Anson was authoritarian as a manager, marching his players onto the field in military formation and banning alcohol consumption during the playing season. Starting in the latter 1880s, he often bet on baseball, mainly on his team&#x27;s chances to win the pennant. However, in that era, the main concern was players taking bribes to purposely lose games. Betting by players, managers, and owners was regarded as acceptable so long as they did not bet against their team doing well or associate with gamblers.
On corruption in sports, he said the following in 1891: &quot;The time may have been, and probably was, when base-ball was as rotten as horse racing, but that time has gone by. The men in control of base-ball matters are of the highest personal character, and no one will say anything against them. As to the charges against any individual player, I will believe them when they have been proved. Every thing [sic] possible has been done to protect the patrons of the National game, and efforts in that direction will never be abated. I don’t know of any crookedness in the ball field. If I did I’d undoubtedly say something about it.&quot;
A chronological review of 162 reports of bets on regular season baseball by players, managers or club officials, from 1876 to 1900, tallied the sport&#x27;s top bettors in that era as follows:

* 1. Anson (57), Chicago&#x27;s captain-manager; Hall of Famer

===Albert Spalding and James Hart===
Anson first met Albert Spalding while both were players; Spalding was a pitcher for the Rockford Forest Citys, Anson played for the Marshalltown, Iowa, team. Spalding convinced the 18-year-old Anson to come play for the Forest Citys at a salary of $65 per month. In 1876, when Anson was playing for Philadelphia, Spalding and William Hulbert lured Anson to the Chicago team, which Spalding now managed. After signing the contract, Anson had second thoughts (his future wife did not want to leave her family in Philadelphia), and offered Spalding $1,000 to void the contract. Spalding held Anson to the contract, and Anson came to Chicago in March 1876.

Spalding retired as a player and manager after the 1877 season, but continued as secretary, and later president, of the White Stockings. Anson became a player/manager of the team in 1879, and by 1889 had a 13% ownership. In 1888 Spalding announced that the White Stockings, including Anson, and a &quot;picked nine&quot; from the rest of the National League would begin a World Tour after the end of the season. Spalding put up most of the money, but Anson invested $3,750 of his own. James Hart was hired as business manager and Anson developed an intense dislike for him.

After Spalding stepped down as president of the Chicago club in 1891, he appointed James Hart to the position, which Anson felt should have been his despite his dismal business record. Spalding, however, continued to run the club behind the scenes. In December 1892, Hart, with Spalding&#x27;s blessing, reorganized the White Stockings into a stock company. Anson was required to sign a new contract, which ended in 1898 instead of 1899 as the previous one had. Anson spotted the error later but said nothing, trusting that Spalding would honor the previous terms.

Hart began to undermine Anson&#x27;s managerial decisions by reversing fines and suspensions imposed by Anson. By 1897 Anson had little control over his players; after Anson demanded a sportswriter print that Anson thought &quot;the Chicago ball club is composed of drunkards and loafers who are throwing him down&quot;, his days as manager were numbered. Spalding invited Anson and his wife on a four-week journey to England in late November 1897. Spalding dropped many hints on the voyage, encouraging Anson to voluntarily retire, but Anson had no intention of doing so. Things remained in limbo until January 29, 1898 when the Associated Press printed a statement by Spalding: &quot;I have taken pains as a mediator to find out from Chicagoans how they feel about a change of management. There has been a decided undercurrent in favor... Lovers of baseball think that Anson has been in power too long.&quot;
===Career hits total===
There has been some controversy as to whether Anson should be considered the first player ever to reach the 3,000 hit milestone. For many years, official statistics credited him with achieving that goal. When the first edition of Macmillan&#x27;s &quot;Baseball Encyclopedia&quot; was published in 1969, it disregarded a rule in place only for the 1887 season which counted base-on-balls (walks) as hits and at-bats instead of zeroes in both categories as they were before and have been since. Anson&#x27;s 60 walks were removed from his 1887 hit total, resulting in a career mark of 2,995, though later editions of the encyclopedia still added five more hits to exactly 3,000.

The other controversy over Anson&#x27;s total hits had to do with his five years in the National Association. Neither the Macmillan &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; editions nor MLB itself at that time recognized the National Association as being a major league. MLB.com does not count Anson&#x27;s time in the National Association in his statistics, but tallies his National League total as 3,011 hits. This places Anson 25th on the all-time list.

Other sources credit Anson with a different number of hits, largely because scoring and record keeping was haphazard in baseball until well into the 20th century.

Beginning with the publication of the &quot;Baseball Encyclopedia&quot;, statisticians have continually found errors and have adjusted career totals accordingly. According to the &quot;Sporting News&quot; baseball record book, which does not take National Association statistics into account, Anson had 3,012 hits over his career. Baseball Reference also credits Anson with 3,012 hits during his National League career; including his time in the NA, Anson is credited with 3,435 hits. The National Baseball Hall of Fame, which uses statistics verified by the Elias Sports Bureau, credits Anson with 3,081 hits. This figure disregards games played in the NA, but includes the walks earned during 1887 as hits.

==Retirement==
Anson briefly made a return to baseball managing the New York Giants in June and July 1898. He then attempted to buy a Chicago team in the Western League, but failed after being opposed by Spalding. In 1900, he helped to organize a new version of the defunct American Association, called the New American Base Ball Association, and was named its president. However, at the first sign of trouble he dissolved the league before a single game was played, drawing heated criticism from other backers.

After a number of failed business attempts, including a handball arena and bottled ginger beer that exploded on store shelves, he was later elected city clerk of Chicago in 1905. After serving one term, he failed in the Democratic primary to become sheriff in 1907.

In 1907, Anson made another attempt to come back to baseball, acquiring a semi-pro team in the Chicago City League, which he would call &quot;Anson&#x27;s Colts&quot;. Anson initially had no intention of playing for the team, but in June 1907, at the age of 55, Anson started playing some games at first base in an attempt to boost poor attendance. Despite the draw of seeing Anson play, the team did not attract much attendance, and lost money for Anson. In the fall of 1908, Anson assembled a semi-pro football team, also called Anson&#x27;s Colts. Although the football team won the city championship, they were not a financial success.

Anson&#x27;s few successful ventures included a combination billiards hall and a bowling alley he opened in downtown Chicago in 1899. Anson was named vice-president of the American Bowling Congress in 1903, and led a team to the five-man national championship in 1904. Anson was forced to sell the billiards hall in 1909 when faced with mounting financial problems that led to his bankruptcy. Anson was also an avid golfer.

Anson&#x27;s 1900 book &quot;A Ball Player&#x27;s Career: Being the Personal Reminiscences of Adrian C. Anson&quot;, was ghostwritten by Chicago horse racing writer and poet Richard Cary Jr., who had the pen name of Hyder Ali. Right after it was published, Cary told the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;, &quot;I really thought when I started that the ‘Cap’ [sic] would be able to reel off the story of his life about as fast as a nimble man would care to write it. It took me just two days to find that was not the case. A day and a half to get the ‘Cap’ to sit down and the other half day in egging him on. The story had to be literally dragged out of him. The incidents of his baseball career were apparently fresh in his mind, but when it came to actual dates he was all at sea. When he did give a date nine times out of ten it was wrong and had to be corrected later on.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; said whether Anson &quot;wrote every word in this volume of reminiscences or not[,] the book reads characteristically. The expression is Ansonian.&quot;

Anson began acting during his baseball career. In 1888, he made his stage debut with a single appearance in Hoyt&#x27;s play &quot;A Parlor Match&quot; at the Theatre Comique in Harlem. He also played himself in an 1895 Broadway play called &quot;The Runaway Colt&quot;, written to take advantage of his fame. Later, Anson began touring on the vaudeville circuit, a common practice for athletes of the time, which lasted up until about a year before his death.

He first appeared in vaudeville in 1913 doing a monologue and a short dance. In 1914, George M. Cohan wrote a monologue for him, and in 1917, Cohan, with &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; sportswriter Ring Lardner wrote another piece for him, titled &quot;First Aid for Father&quot;. Anson appeared with two of his grown daughters, Adele and Dorothy, and would bat papier-mâché baseballs made by Albert Spalding into the audience. He appeared in 1921 accompanied by his two daughters in an act written by Ring Lardner with songs by Herman Timberg.

Anson retired from vaudeville in 1921, and continued to refuse a pension from Major League Baseball, despite having no other income. In April 1922, he became the general manager of a new golf club in the South Side of Chicago.

==Death==
Anson died from a glandular ailment on April 14, 1922, three days shy of his 70th birthday. He was interred at the Oak Woods Cemetery in Chicago.

==Legacy==
Anson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939, one of the first 19th century players selected. Over 100 years after his retirement, he still holds several Cubs franchise records, including most career runs batted in, runs, hits, singles, and doubles while being the only Cub in the 3,000 hit club.

Defensively, he also holds the franchise record for putouts, but also is second in franchise history for errors.

On the managerial side, he was the second manager to ever reach 1,000 wins (doing so after Harry Wright), a feat that has seen over sixty managers reach the mark since the 20th century. Anson won 1,282 games with the Cubs, a mark that still stands after a century. Just 24 other managers have won 1,000 games with one team in Major League Baseball.

Anson still holds the Major League record for most seasons played (27), although Nolan Ryan equalled it in 1993.

In a 1992 &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode, &quot;Homer at the Bat&quot;, Anson, along with several other players, was suggested by Mr. Burns as one of the players for his &#x27;all stars&#x27; Baseball team to represent the Springfield power plant, before being informed that they are all long since deceased.

==Personal life==
In 1872, the 20-year-old Anson met 13-year-old Virginia Fiegal, the daughter of a Philadelphia bar and restaurant owner. The couple got married on November 21, 1876; the marriage lasted until her death in 1915. For the first seven years of their marriage, the couple lived in Chicago during the baseball season and Philadelphia during the off-season, but eventually moved to Chicago on a year-round basis.

The Ansons had seven children, three of whom died in infancy. Daughter Grace was born in October 1877; son Adrian Hulbert was born in 1882 and died four days later; daughter Adele was born in April 1884; son Adrian Constantine, Jr. was born in 1887 and died four months later; daughter Dorothy was born in 1889; son John Henry was born in 1892 and died four days later; and daughter Virginia Jeanette was born in 1899.

<text>John Payne Collier (11 January 178917 September 1883) was an English writer and scholar. He was well known for publishing many books on Shakespeare. However, his reputation has declined as a result of the Perkins Folio forgery.

==Reporter and solicitor==
His father, John Dyer Collier (1762–1825), was a successful journalist, and his connection with the press obtained for his son a position on the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; as leader writer, dramatic critic and reporter, which continued until 1847; he was also for some time a reporter for &quot;The Times&quot;. He was summoned before the House of Commons in 1819 for giving an incorrect report of a speech by Joseph Hume. He entered the Middle Temple in 1811, but was not called to the bar until 1829. The delay was partly due to his indiscretion in publishing the &quot;Criticisms on the Bar&quot; (1819) by &quot;Amicus Curiae&quot;.

==Controversial Shakespearean scholar==
Collier&#x27;s leisure was given to the study of Shakespeare and the early English drama. After some minor publications, he produced in 1825–1827 a new edition of Dodsley&#x27;s &quot;Old Plays&quot; and in 1833 a supplementary volume entitled &quot;Five Old Plays&quot;. In 1831 appeared his 3-volume &quot;History of English Dramatic Poetry to the Time of Shakespeare and Annals of the Stage to the Restoration&quot;, a badly arranged but valuable work. It obtained for him the post of librarian to the 6th Duke of Devonshire, and, subsequently, access to the chief collections of early English literature throughout the kingdom, especially to the treasures of Lord Ellesmere at Bridgewater House. Other publications included a script in 1828 under the title &quot;The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Punch and Judy&quot;.

He produced the &quot;Memoirs of Edward Alleyn&quot; for the Shakespeare Society in 1841. He followed up this volume with the &quot;Alleyn Papers&quot; (1843) and the &quot;Diary of Philip Henslowe&quot; (1845). Collier used these opportunities to commence a series of literary fabrications, as the debates of the following decades revealed. His 8-volume edition of the Works of Shakespeare began to appear in 1842. His edition attracted criticism from his long-time friend, the literary historian Revd. Alexander Dyce, who nonetheless also found much to commend in it, including Collier&#x27;s biographical essay. In 1847 he was appointed secretary to the Royal Commission on the British Museum.

===The Perkins Folio===
Over the next several years he claimed to find a number of new documents relating to Shakespeare&#x27;s life and business. After &quot;New Facts&quot;, &quot;New Particulars&quot; and &quot;Further Particulars respecting Shakespeare&quot; had appeared and passed muster, Collier produced (1852) the famous &quot;Perkins Folio&quot;, a copy of the Second Folio (1632), so called from a name written on the title-page. In this book were numerous manuscript emendations of Shakespeare, said by Collier to be from the hand of an &quot;old corrector&quot;. He published these alterations as &quot;Notes and Emendations to the Text of Shakespeare&quot; (1853) as a supplementary volume to his edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s works, bringing out a revised edition of this volume within months of the first. At the same time he published an edition of the plays in a single volume (the &quot;Monovolume&quot; edition), incorporating the Perkins Folio amendments without any detailed commentary.

===Unfavourable reception===
Collier&#x27;s friend Dyce was among the first to reject many of the alterations by the &quot;Old Corrector&quot; as &quot;ignorant, tasteless and wanton&quot;, while recognizing that others required no more authority than common sense to be accepted as correct, many having been proposed already by other scholars. The authenticity of the whole, however, was roundly rejected, on internal evidence, by S. W. Singer in &quot;The Text of Shakespeare Vindicated&quot; (1853). In 1853 J.O. Halliwell showed the Dulwich letter to have been (at best) misinterpreted by Collier, and stated (with the owner&#x27;s permission) his misgivings that Lord Ellesmere&#x27;s Shakespearean manuscripts were all modern forgeries.

In 1855, in &quot;Notes and Queries&quot;, Volume X, Collier reported a new &quot;find&quot; in the re-discovery of his own shorthand notes from lectures given by Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1811 or 1812, which he published as a volume in 1856 together with a list of the emendations in the Perkins Folio. In a public letter soon extended into a short tract of 1855, A.E. Brae (anonymously) brought evidence challenging the authenticity of Collier&#x27;s lecture notes, and in effect accusing Collier of having perpetrated the Shakespeare alterations as a fraud. In response to these challenges, in January 1856 Collier made a legal affidavit swearing to the truth of his statements regarding the Coleridge lectures and the Perkins folio, and sought to move the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench for a criminal action for libel against the publisher John Russell Smith. While Lord Campbell, presiding, refused to proceed, he commended the character of the applicant and pronounced him to be vindicated by his affidavit, and afterwards gave Collier other tokens of his friendship and esteem.

===Controversy and exposure===
Collier&#x27;s second edition of the &quot;Works of Shakespeare&quot; appeared in 6 volumes in 1858, and bore both in its Preface and in the notes to the text a scathing attack on (among others) Alexander Dyce, accusing him of selective appropriation of Collier&#x27;s emendations without acknowledgement, motivated by an intention to disparage. Their friendship irrecoverably broken, Dyce responded in a full volume by rejecting Collier&#x27;s charges against him as artful and deliberate misrepresentations.

In 1853 Collier had made a gift of the Perkins Folio to his patron, the 6th Duke of Devonshire, who remained supportive towards him but died in 1858. In 1859, his cousin and successor the 7th Duke submitted the Folio to the scrutiny of Sir Frederic Madden, Keeper of Manuscripts at the British Museum, and Nicholas Hamilton, of that department, who pronounced that the emendations were incontestably forgeries of modern date. These findings were further confirmed by a microscopic physical analysis by N.S. Maskelyne, Keeper of the Mineral Department, showing that the supposed archaic handwriting of the emendations was made using not ink but a sepia paint, which overlay erased pencil annotations in modern handwriting closely resembling that of John Payne Collier. The facts were presented by C.M. Ingleby in collected form in 1859, with a full-page dedication naming Andrew Edmund Brae as the first to protest against the specious readings of the Perkins Folio, and, by the use of philological methods, the first to prove that they were modern fabrications.

Ingleby showed that the annotations incorporated ideas drawn from very recent scholarship, knowledge or usage. Hamilton&#x27;s findings were more fully expressed in his &quot;Inquiry&quot; (1860). A.E. Brae, now in his own name, reviewed the matter more at length in 1860, and Ingleby gave a fuller account of the discussion raised by Collier&#x27;s emendations in his &quot;Complete View of the Shakespeare Controversy&quot; (1861).

===Legacy===
During the later 18th century, literary forgeries had a certain esteem, when audacious impostures like the &quot;De Situ Britanniae&quot;, the pseudo-Ossian, the medieval poems of Thomas Chatterton, or the works of William Henry Ireland might carry their own worth, and capture the romantic imagination. The case of Collier, in the mid-19th century, was different, because it was profoundly shocking to the scholarly establishment to discover that a long-established colleague in their midst, a person closely associated with the British Museum, the editor of numerous important editions, with privileged access to the primary documents of English literature, should become suspected of the systematic falsification of evidence and possibly the mutilation of original materials, especially in relation to William Shakespeare. Much as Sir Edward Dering&#x27;s forgeries had corrupted the historical record in ways that were then not yet recognized, such a presence placed a question-mark over the authenticity of the whole resource, and over the work of other scholars whom he might have misled.

It became clear during the 1850s to most of his critics, that Collier was himself the deceiver, not the deceived. Since then, the falsifications of which he was unquestionably guilty among the manuscripts at Dulwich College have left little doubt of it. He interpolated the name of Shakespeare in a genuine letter at Dulwich, and the spurious entries in Alleyn&#x27;s &quot;Diary&quot; were proved to be by Collier&#x27;s hand when the sale of his library in 1884 gave access to a transcript he had made of the Diary with interlineations corresponding with the Dulwich forgeries. No statement of his can be accepted without verification, nor any manuscript handled by him, without careful examination, but he did much useful work. He compiled a valuable &quot;Bibliographical and Critical Account of the Rarest Books in the English Language&quot; (1865); he reprinted a great number of early English tracts of extreme rarity and rendered good service to the numerous antiquarian societies with which he was connected, especially in the editions he produced for the Camden Society and the Percy Society.

His &quot;Old Man&#x27;s Diary&quot; (1871–72) is an interesting record, though even here the taint of fabrication is not absent. Unfortunately, what he did amiss is more striking to the imagination than what he did aright, and he will be chiefly remembered by it. He died at Maidenhead, where he had long resided, on 17 September 1883.

==Modern views==
An attempt to redeem Collier&#x27;s reputation from the charge of forgery was made by Dewey Ganzel in his 1982 study &quot;Fortune and Men&#x27;s Eyes.&quot; He argued that Collier&#x27;s accusers, led by Frederic Madden, were motivated largely by envy and class bias, and that they were upper-class dilettantes determined to put down a lower-class but ferociously hard-working and talented striver. Some of the accusations against Collier, such as the claim by American psychiatrist Samuel A. Tannenbaum that Collier had forged &quot;all&quot; the accounts of the Master of the Revels, do not stand up to critical examination.

Scholarly opinion, however, still convicts Collier of the forgeries. Samuel Schoenbaum pointed out that in 1875, many years after the Perkins Folio affair, Collier claimed to possess a John Milton folio &quot;full of Milton&#x27;s brief notes and references; 1500 of them.&quot; By that time his reputation was so tarnished that a fresh campaign was impossible. His &quot;Milton&quot; folio is preserved in the New York Public Library, but the annotations are not by Milton. Schoenbaum also referred to entries in Collier&#x27;s diary in which, late in life, he expressed an unspecified remorse. On 19 February 1881 he wrote, &quot;I have done many base things in my time—some that I knew to be base at the moment, and many that I deeply regretted afterwards and up to this very day&quot;: and on 14 May 1882 he wrote, &quot;I am bitterly sad and most sincerely grieved that in every way I am such a despicable offender[.] I am ashamed of almost every act of my life... My repentance is bitter and sincere[.]&quot; Frank Kermode observed that Collier&#x27;s &quot;repentance would have been more useful if he had identified his fabrications and forgeries.&quot;

A more recent study in two volumes by Arthur Freeman and Janet Ing Freeman, after re-examining the evidence, again concluded that Collier was a forger. Dewey Ganzel responded to this study,&quot;He [Arthur Freeman] assumes Collier&#x27;s guilt and that leads to looking at Collier&#x27;s work with the expectation of finding fraud... my study revealed what was the irrefutable evidence that he was a victim of a conspiracy of which Frederick Madden was a part... Freeman starts with a criminal; I tried to end up with a man. Freeman says that in &#x27;suspending judgement&#x27; of Collier&#x27;s guilt &#x27;one forfeits the opportunity to explain him at all.&#x27; That confusion leads to only one kind of explanation of the events he describes, and, for me, not a very satisfactory one. The point is, the crimes are not &#x27;unproven&#x27;; the perpetrators are.&quot;

Ganzel suggested that Collier&#x27;s so-called &quot;confession&quot; may have referred to non-acceptance of certain Christian beliefs. Richard J. Westall, Collier&#x27;s great-great-grandson, published a note which Collier dictated to his daughter shortly before his death: &quot;I have written much in verse and prose, but can confidently say that I never produced a line, either in verse or prose that was calculated to be injurious either to morality or religion&quot;. Westall also referred to Arthur Freeman&#x27;s comment in a letter to Westall, that &quot;we never presume JPC guilty until the evidence is sifted&quot;: Westall remarks that this &quot;hardly squares with the disparagement made in their [the Freemans&#x27;] biography of those who &#x27;high-mindedly&#x27; suspend judgement&quot;, by which they state that such an approach &quot;forfeits the opportunity to explain him at all&quot;.

<doc id="213909" wikidata="Q54212" url="?curid=213909" title="Barnsley">
<text>Barnsley () is a market town in South Yorkshire, England. It is the main settlement of the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley and the fourth largest settlement in South Yorkshire. The town&#x27;s population was 96,888 in 2021, while the wider borough had a population of 244,600 in the 2021 census.

Historically in the West Riding of Yorkshire, Barnsley is located on the M1 corridor between the cities of Sheffield to the south and Wakefield to the north. Doncaster is to the east, Huddersfield to the north-west, and Manchester lies west across the Peak District to which it is connected to via the A628 road.

Barnsley&#x27;s former industries include linen, coal mining, glass making and textiles. Barnsley&#x27;s culture is rooted in its industrial heritage and it has a tradition of brass bands, originally created as social clubs by its mining communities.

==History==

Following the Norman invasion of 1066, many abbeys and priories were built in Yorkshire. Norman landowners increased their revenues and established new towns such as Barnsley, Doncaster, Hull, Leeds, Scarborough, and Sheffield, among others. Of towns founded before the conquest, only Bridlington, Pocklington, and York continued at a prominent level.

Although settlements had been established in the Barnsley area for centuries prior, and was a well known centre to trade, the first reference to Barnsley occurs in 1086 in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, in which it is called Berneslai and has a population of around 200.

The town was in the parish of Silkstone and developed little until in the 1150s, when it was given to the Pontefract Priory. The monks built a town where three roads met: the Sheffield to Wakefield, Rotherham to Huddersfield and Cheshire to Doncaster routes. The Domesday village became known as Old Barnsley, and a town grew up on the new site.

The monks erected a chapel of ease dedicated to Saint Mary, which survived until 1820 , and established a market. In 1249, a Royal charter was granted to Barnsley permitting it to hold a weekly market on Wednesdays and annual four-day fair at Michaelmas. By the 1290s, three annual fairs were held. The town was the centre of the Staincross wapentake, but in the mid-16th century had only 600 inhabitants.

From the 17th century, Barnsley developed into a stop-off point on the route between Leeds, Wakefield, Sheffield and London. The traffic generated as a result of its location fuelled trade, with hostelries and related services prospering. A principal centre for linen-weaving during the 18th and 19th century, Barnsley grew into an important manufacturing town.

The first passenger station to serve Barnsley was opened by the North Midland Railway in 1840. Barnsley station (later called Cudworth railway station) was located some away at Cudworth. On 1 January 1850, the Manchester and Leeds Railway opened Barnsley Exchange station, close to the town centre. On 1 May 1870, the Midland Railway opened Regent Street station, a temporary structure. A new station was opened by the MR on the Regent Street site on 23 August 1873. As it incorporated the old court house in its construction Regent Street station was renamed Barnsley Court House station.

Barnsley became a municipal borough in 1869, and a county borough in 1913. The town&#x27;s boundaries were extended to absorb Ardsley and Monk Bretton in 1921 and Carlton in 1938.

Barnsley was the site of a human crush that resulted in the deaths of 16 children in 1908, at a public hall now known as The Civic, when children were rushing to watch a film in the building.

Barnsley has a long tradition of glass-making, however Barnsley is most famous for its coal mines. In 1960, there were 70 collieries within a radius of Barnsley town centre, but the last of these closed in 1994. The National Union of Mineworkers still has its HQ in Barnsley.

George Orwell mentioned the town in &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot;. He arrived in the town on 11 March 1936 and spent a number of days in the town living in the houses of the working class miners while researching for the book. He wrote very critically of the council&#x27;s expenditure on the construction of Barnsley Town Hall and claimed that the money should have been spent on improving the housing and living conditions of the local miners.

==Governance==

The Town Hall itself is visible behind some gardens; the building is made of white stone and has an impressive clock tower. Opened on 14 December 1933, Barnsley Town Hall is the seat of local government in the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley.
The County Borough of Barnsley was created in 1913, administered independently of the West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1974, following the Local Government Act 1972, the county borough was abolished and Barnsley became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley in the new county of South Yorkshire, along with nine urban districts and parts of two rural districts of the surrounding area, including many towns and villages including Penistone and Cudworth.

Elections to Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council have seen the Labour Party retain control of the council at every election. Following the latest election in 2012 the council has 53 Labour, 5 Barnsley Independent Group and 5 Conservative councillors. The borough council elects the mayor every year. On the day of the election, a parade takes place in front of the town hall in honour of the new mayor.

Barnsley is split into four constituencies, Barnsley North, whose MP is Dan Jarvis of the Labour Party, Barnsley South, whose MP is Stephanie Peacock of the Labour Party, Penistone and Stocksbridge, whose MP is Marie Tidball of the Labour Party, and Wentworth and Dearne, whose MP is John Healey of the Labour Party.

==Geography==
Barnsley is located in the valley of the River Dearne at the eastern foothills of the Pennines, near the uplands of the Peak District to the west. Geologically, the town is located within the area of the South Yorkshire Coalfield, consisting of the middle coal measures and sandstones laid down in the Carboniferous period. The town is approximately north of Sheffield, south of Leeds, south of Wakefield and east of Manchester.

===Green belt===
Barnsley is within a green belt region that extends into the borough and wider surrounding counties. It is in place to reduce urban sprawl, prevent the towns in the Barnsley/Dearne Valley conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage brownfield reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas, and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.

The green belt surrounds the Barnsley built-up area, separating towns and villages throughout the borough. Larger outlying communities such as Cudworth, Dodworth, Kendray, Monk Bretton, and Worsbrough are also exempt from the green belt area. However, nearby smaller villages, hamlets and rural areas such as Swaithe, Smithley, Low Laithes, and Upper Norcroft are &#x27;washed over&#x27; by the designation. Much semi-rural land on the fringes is also included. The green belt was first defined in 1979, and the area in 2017 amounted to some , 77% of the borough.

A subsidiary aim of the green belt is to encourage recreation and leisure interests, with rural landscape features, greenfield areas and facilities including the River Dearne valley, and tributaries Cawthorne Dyke and Tanyard Beck; Hugset and Dovecliffe Woods; Worsbrough Mill Park and reservoir; Dearne Valley Park; Trans Pennine Trail; Kendray recreation ground; Locke Park; Stainborough Cricket Club and Park; Wentworth Castle and gardens; Barnsley Colliery; Monk Bretton Priory; Laithes Lane playing fields; and Barnsley Golf Club.

===Ethnic groups===
According to the 2021 census, Barnsley was 95.5% White, 1.4% Asian, 1.1% Mixed, 1.0% Black and 1.0% other.
Previously 2011 census data showed the town was 94.7% White British, 1.1% Asian and 0.8% Black.

==Economy==
The town was known for a thriving linen trade prior to the arrival of the coal industry. From the 1850s onwards, a large number of coal pits were opened, mostly in the villages surrounding the town, especially those to the east. Coal mining was the major industry of the town until the late 1950s, when a long-term decline set in. All the mines in the borough are now closed, the last to shut being Goldthorpe Colliery in 1994. Wire, linen and glass making were also major industries, but only glass making remains, with one company still operating. The coat of arms for the town has both a coal miner and a glass-blower supporting a shield and depicting local families and other industries, above a ribbon bearing the town&#x27;s motto, &quot;Spectemur agendo&quot; (&quot;Let us be judged by our acts&quot;).
Major companies in Barnsley include online retailer ASOS, the largest cake bakery in Europe, Premier Foods (formerly Lyons Bakery) who make the Mr Kipling Cake brand, Ardagh Glass (glass bottle makers), Symphony Kitchens, Premdor, several double glazing joinery manufacturers and a number of other large food manufacturers. Most of these businesses are based on industrial parks outside the town centre including many on reclaimed former coal mine sites. The town centre is now moving towards a service economy.

In June 2024, unemployment stood at 3.4% in Barnsley North and 4.1% in Barnsley South, compared to the national level of 3.9%.

The western half of the borough stretches from the M1 to the edge of the Peak District and is rural in character. This western part includes the market town of Penistone and Wentworth Castle and its Grade I listed gardens, Cannon Hall Park and Museum, Cawthorne Jubilee Museum, Wortley Hall and gardens, and Wortley Top Forge (16th century Forge).

In 2002, Barnsley Council and partners launched a consultation, &quot;Rethinking Barnsley&quot;. It led to a regeneration programme centred on the town centre which is still underway. Developments included the transport interchange, a cultural centre in the old Civic Hall, a Digital Media Centre (opened August 2007), and new offices and apartments throughout the town centre. At the same time new housing areas were developed. Business parks on the M1 at Junctions 37 and 36, and in the Dearne Valley, have expanded job opportunities. Unemployment is now below the national average. The economic development of Barnsley is led by the Barnsley Development Agency.

Significant industrial employers include the Ardagh Group and ASOS.com.

===Town centre===
A large part of Barnsley town centre was constructed during the 1960s. The area around Cheapside and May Day Green, the Metropolitan Centre, is home to the market and many national high street chains such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Carphone Warehouse, Vodafone, Boots, and The Body Shop. It is in the process of renovation to make space for a new retail and leisure development. Alhambra Shopping Centre, which was opened in 1991, houses retailers such as Next, Poundstretcher, and Primark. Other prominent areas include Queen Street, home to Marks and Spencer, Market Street, Eldon Street and the Victorian Arcade, which houses the majority of the independent and designer retailers in Barnsley. The town also has a large concentration of pubs and bars in the central district. There is also a twin auditorium cinema called Parkway Cinema Barnsley occupying what once was the Odeon Cinema on Eldon Street.

Outside the town centre are large retail units, retail parks and supermarkets, which include Asda, Morrisons, Currys, and Halfords.

The development of a new shopping centre was started in the town centre in late 2015.

===Development===

*Barnsley College A Block was completed and opened in September 2011.
*Aimed for opening in 2021, a new area of town, covering the current Cheapside and semi-open market area is intended to open by spring 2021. The facility is under construction, and is named the Glass Works. The first stage of the development has opened and consists of the town&#x27;s market. The new facility will create an urban, glass and steel fronted open-top shopping area, comparable to that of Trinity Walk in Wakefield. The development includes a 13-screen Cineworld cinema, bowling alley and high street shops. (now completed)

==Culture==
===Theatre===
The Civic, in Barnsley town centre, is a multi-purpose performance venue in a grade II listed building. The building was originally the Barnsley Mechanics Institute and Public Hall, built by Henry Harvey in 1877. His brother Charles Harvey, gave the building to the people of the town a few years later, renaming it the Harvey Institute. The Harvey Institute was host to many types of entertainment, including variety shows and cinema. It was also home to the public library and shops; public meetings and celebrations were held in the hall; and education was provided. The School of Art occupied the Public Hall from 1878 to 1948, which was also used as first headquarters and billets for &quot;Barnsley Pals&quot; during World War I. In 1962, the building became Barnsley Civic Theatre, closing in 1998.
The Civic was re-opened in March 2009 after a major redevelopment, which included provision for a theatre and public art gallery. The Civic has hosted high-profile acts such as Al Murray and Russell Howard. The Civic houses a contemporary art gallery that hosts touring exhibition from the V&amp;A and the Flow Gallery in London. The Civic also curates its own work for touring.
The Lamproom Theatre has four theatrical companies, and showcases theatre in the town.

The Academy Theatre is part of the Take 2 Centre where performances range from comedy to musicals. The Take 2 Centre houses The Take 2 Performing Arts Academy, The Stage Door Restaurant, and The Take 2 Music Centre.

===Music===
Barnsley is home to a tradition of brass bands, which were originally created as social clubs for the mining communities. Grimethorpe Colliery Band, located in Grimethorpe, to the east of Barnsley, is perhaps the best known brass band in Britain. It rose to fame in the film &quot;Brassed Off&quot; and is now the &#x27;artist in residence&#x27; at the Royal College of Music, London. The band has performed in Hyde Park during the Last Night of the Proms. Other events include Picnic In The Park, being held annually to raise funds for Barnsley Hospice.

There is a live rock and hip hop music scene, which reached its height in the Britpop years, around 1997, due to its close proximity to Sheffield and Manchester. The 1980s saw the rise of Saxon (metal band), Danse Society (Goth) and Party Day (Indie-rock). Both Alex Turner and Matt Helders, of the Arctic Monkeys, studied music at Barnsley College.

Barnsley is the home of several live music venues such as The Underground, The Garrison, The Old No 7 and The Old School House. Barnsley formerly hosted the Barnsley Origin Music festival (BOMfest), an outdoor summer music festival which catered for local and national artists. It now hosts Barnsley Live, an annual music festival featuring local acts that takes place in the town centre over a weekend in June.

In December 2023, a Christmas carol, written by local musician Arthur Godfrey in 1933, was rediscovered in the archives of the &quot;Barnsley Chronicle&quot;. It was re-recorded to celebrate the 90th birthday of the Town Hall.

==Sport==
Barnsley F.C. play in League One, the third tier of English football. Their home ground, Oakwell Stadium is situated in Oakwell, just outside the town centre. The club has had a mixed recent history. In the late 1990s, they had a brief spell in the Premier League, but were relegated after one season. Subsequent seasons saw them relegated to the third tier of English football; they were promoted to the second tier in 2006, beating Swansea in the play off final. They were relegated in the 2013–14 season. After two seasons, Barnsley regained a place in the second tier, following a victory at Wembley in the 2016 Football League One play-off final, and the winners of the 2016 Football League Trophy Final. They were again relegated to the third tier at the end of the 2017–18 season.

Also in Barnsley, there is a women&#x27;s football team called Barnsley WFC, who currently play in the North East Regional Women&#x27;s Football League Premier Division.

Speedway racing was staged at a track near Barnsley at Lundwood. The track entered a team in the Northern Leagues of 1929 and 1930. Two-time British Under-21 Championship rider Josh Bates hails from the town. Greyhound racing was held at Dillington Park Stadium from 1934 -1990 and at the Dearne Athletic and Sports Stadium in Old Mill Lane, from 1934 to 1935. A third venue at the Queen&#x27;s Ground was refused three times by the Corporation in 1936.

Rugby league is played in the town, at a number of clubs, past and present.
Dodworth ARLFC played in the second division of the BARLA run Pennine League, playing through the winter. They played at the Miners Welfare ground in Dodworth until deteriorating player participation forced the club to fold 5 games into the 2013/14 season.
The same fate befell Hoyland Vikings ARLFC, prompting talk of a merger. This however failed to materialise leaving only one club to represent the town.
The only representation now comes from the Dearne Valley Bulldogs in nearby Bolton on Dearne. Like Dodworth and Hoyland, they participate in the Pennine League.
Barnsley Broncos play in the RFL conference, which is a summer competition and runs from May to September. Also based at the Miners Welfare, Barnsley Broncos were set up to play in the less intense summer season.

Shaw Lane is the home to many sports in town, cricket, rugby union, squash, bowls, football, athletics, and archery are all played to a high standard and host many of the towns teams including Barnsley CC and Barnsley RUFC.

<text>Bergslagen is a historical, cultural, and linguistic region located north of Lake Mälaren in northern Svealand, Sweden, traditionally known as a mining district. In Bergslagen, the mining and metallurgic industries have been important since the Middle Ages although Malmfälten (&quot;the Ore Fields&quot;), the mining district of northernmost Sweden centred at the towns of Kiruna and Malmberget, has been of greater importance during the 20th century.

Bergslagen is not precisely defined, but generally understood to cover part of the provinces of Västmanland, Dalarna (the southern part), and Värmland (the eastern part). Typical towns in the area include Lindesberg, Nora, Fagersta, Sala, Kristinehamn, Filipstad, Grythyttan, Ludvika and Hedemora. Also parts of northern Östergötland, around Finspång, as well as southern Närke can be included, then often referring to &quot;South Bergslagen&quot;. A wider definition of the area can include parts of Gästrikland (Hofors) and Uppland (the former iron manufacturing district centred on Dannemora) as well.

== History ==
The conflict of interests between iron exports from Bergslagen and territorial conflicts at Denmark&#x27;s southern border was a chief reason behind the Engelbrekt rebellion in 1434 and the following strife that ultimately resulted in the dissolution of the Kalmar Union in 1523.

Exports from Bergslagen were a source of wealth for Swedish merchants such as Birgitta Ingvaldsdotter who traded in the early part of the 16th century.

The region was an industrial powerhouse from the 17th century, up to the Steel crisis during the 1970s.

== Minerals and mining ==
The area is very rich in minerals. Mining has been focused on iron ore for centuries but other ores have been mined as well. Most mines are now closed, but in the 1970s many mines were still in operation. The earliest signs of iron making date back to 400 BC while industrial-scale activities date back to the 17th century.

At Långban, where iron and manganese have been mined, 270 mineral species have been reported to date. Many of these minerals are unique to the Långban deposit, and 67 minerals were first found at this site.

<text>Robert Dodsley (13 February 1703 – 23 September 1764) was an English bookseller, publisher, poet, playwright, and miscellaneous writer.

==Life==
Dodsley was born near Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, where his father was master of the free school.
He is said to have been apprenticed to a stocking-weaver in Mansfield, from whom he ran away, going into service as a footman. Profits and fame from his early literary works enabled Dodsley to establish himself with the help of his friends (Alexander Pope lent him £100) as a bookseller at the sign of Tully&#x27;s Head in Pall Mall, London, in 1735.

He soon became one of the foremost publishers of the day. One of his first publications was Samuel Johnson&#x27;s &quot;London&quot; for which he paid ten guineas in 1738. He published many of Johnson&#x27;s works, and he suggested and helped to finance Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary&quot;. Pope also made over to Dodsley his interest in his letters. In 1738, the publication of Paul Whitehead&#x27;s &quot;Manners&quot; was voted scandalous by the House of Lords and led to Dodsley&#x27;s imprisonment for a brief period. Dodsley published for Edward Young and Mark Akenside, and in 1751 brought out Thomas Gray&#x27;s &quot;Elegy&quot;. He was also publisher to the Rev. Joseph Spence and Joseph Warton, and collaborated with John Baskerville, the innovative Birmingham printer.

In 1759, Dodsley retired, leaving the conduct of the business to his brother James, with whom he had been in partnership for many years. He died and was buried at Durham while he was on a visit to his friend Joseph Spence.

==Works==
In 1729, Dodsley published his first work, &quot;Servitude: a Poem written by a Footman&quot;, with a preface and postscript ascribed to Daniel Defoe; and a collection of short poems, &quot;A Muse in Livery, or the Footman&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;, was published by subscription in 1732, Dodsley&#x27;s patrons comprising many persons of high rank. This was followed by a satirical farce called &quot;The Toy-Shop&quot; (Covent Garden, 1735), in which the toymaker indulges in moral observations on his wares, a hint which was probably taken from Thomas Randolph&#x27;s &quot;Conceited Pedlar&quot;. In 1737 his &quot;King and the Miller of Mansfield&quot;, a &quot;dramatic tale&quot; of King Henry II, was produced at Drury Lane, and received with much applause; the sequel, &quot;Sir John Cockle at Court&quot;, a farce, appeared in 1738. Dodsley displayed his egalitarian leanings with the anonymous &quot;The Chronicle of the Kings of England by &quot;Nathan ben Saddi&quot;&quot; (1740), rewriting English history in the style of the King James Version of the Pentateuch. &quot;The Oeconomy of Human Life&quot; appeared in 1750, a collection of moral precepts attributed to ancient authors in India and China, set out in a King James Version style of English attributed to an anonymous translator.
Dodsley is, however, best known as the editor of two collections, one of plays, and one of poems. The first was the &quot;Select Collection of Old Plays&quot; (12 vols., 1744; 2nd edition with notes by Isaac Reed, 12 vols., 1780; 4th edition, by William Carew Hazlitt, 1874–1876, 15 vols). Dodsley&#x27;s collection of poems, &quot;A collection of Poems by Several Hands&quot; (1748, 3 vols.) was ‘to preserve to the public those poetical performances, which seemed to merit a longer remembrance than what would probably be secured to them by the Manner wherein they were originally published’ (Collection of Poems, 1748, vol. 1.iii–iv). Given his literary circle, he was able to fill three volumes of poetry by the time of the first edition on 15 January 1748. By March 1755 it had entered four editions and he added a fourth volume, and in 1758 volumes five and six, hence the change in titles.

In 1745 he published a collection of his dramatic works, and some poems which had been issued separately in one volume under the modest title of &quot;Trifles&quot;. This was followed by &quot;The Triumph of Peace, a Masque occasioned by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle&quot; (1749); his three-canto blank verse georgic on &quot;Agriculture&quot; (1753), originally intended as part of a longer work to be titled &quot;Public Virtue&quot;; &quot;The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green&quot; (acted at Drury Lane 1739, printed 1741); and an ode, &quot;Melpomene&quot; (1751). His tragedy of &quot;Cleone&quot; (1758) had a long run at Covent Garden, 2000 copies being sold on the day of publication, and it passed through four editions within the year.

Dodsley also founded several literary periodicals: &quot;The Museum&quot; (1746–1767, 3 vols.); &quot;The Preceptor&quot; containing a general course of education (1748, 2 vols.), with an introduction by Dr Johnson; &quot;The World&quot; (1753–1756, 4 vols.); and &quot;The Annual Register&quot;, founded in 1758 with Edmund Burke as editor. To these various works, Horace Walpole, Akenside, Soame Jenyns, Lord Lyttelton, Lord Chesterfield, Burke and others were contributors.

He produced and published more successful works towards the end of his life. &quot;The Select Fables of Esop&quot; (1761), which remained in print in various editions for many decades, for which he and some of his friends wrote additional fables. The &quot;Works of William Shenstone&quot; (3 vols., 1764–1769) was brought out as a memorial after Shenstone&#x27;s sudden death, and was very selectively edited so as to show that writer at his best.

<text>A triangular number or triangle number counts objects arranged in an equilateral triangle. Triangular numbers are a type of figurate number, other examples being square numbers and cube numbers. The th triangular number is the number of dots in the triangular arrangement with dots on each side, and is equal to the sum of the natural numbers from 1 to . The sequence of triangular numbers, starting with the 0th triangular number, is

==Formula==

The triangular numbers are given by the following explicit formulas:

{2} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\
&amp;= {n+1 \choose 2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;}}
where formula_1 is notation for a binomial coefficient. It represents the number of distinct pairs that can be selected from objects, and it is read aloud as &quot; plus one choose two&quot;.

The fact that the formula_2th triangular number equals formula_3 can be illustrated using a visual proof. For every triangular number formula_4, imagine a &quot;half-rectangle&quot; arrangement of objects corresponding to the triangular number, as in the figure below. Copying this arrangement and rotating it to create a rectangular figure doubles the number of objects, producing a rectangle with dimensions formula_5, which is also the number of objects in the rectangle. Clearly, the triangular number itself is always exactly half of the number of objects in such a figure, or: formula_6. The example formula_7 follows:

This formula can be proven formally using mathematical induction. It is clearly true for formula_8:

formula_9

Now assume that, for some natural number formula_10, formula_11. We can then verify it for formula_12:
formula_13

so if the formula is true for formula_10, it is true for formula_12. Since it is clearly true for formula_8, it is therefore true for formula_17, formula_18, and ultimately all natural numbers formula_2 by induction.

The German mathematician and scientist, Carl Friedrich Gauss, is said to have found this relationship in his early youth, by multiplying pairs of numbers in the sum by the values of each pair . However, regardless of the truth of this story, Gauss was not the first to discover this formula, and some find it likely that its origin goes back to the Pythagoreans in the 5th century BC. The two formulas were described by the Irish monk Dicuil in about 816 in his Computus. An English translation of Dicuil&#x27;s account is available.

Occasionally it is necessary to compute large triangular numbers where the standard formula codice_1 would suffer integer overflow before the final division by 2. For example, = 210 &lt; 256, so will fit into an 8-bit byte, but not the intermediate product 420. This can be solved by dividing either or by 2 before the multiplication, whichever is even. This does not require a conditional branch if implemented as codice_2. If codice_3 is odd, the binary OR operation codice_4 has no effect, so this is equivalent to codice_5 and thus correct. If codice_3 is even, setting the low bit with codice_4 is the same as adding 1, while the 1 added before the division is truncated away, so this is equivalent to codice_8 and also correct.

==Relations to other figurate numbers==
Triangular numbers have a wide variety of relations to other figurate numbers.

Most simply, the sum of two consecutive triangular numbers is a square number, since:

:formula_20
:formula_21
:formula_22
:formula_23 

with the sum being the square of the difference between the two (and thus the difference of the two being the square root of the sum):
formula_24

This property, colloquially known as the theorem of Theon of Smyrna, is visually demonstrated in the following sum, which represents formula_25 as digit sums:

formula_26

This fact can also be demonstrated graphically by positioning the triangles in opposite directions to create a square:
The double of a triangular number, as in the visual proof from the above section , is called a pronic number.

There are infinitely many triangular numbers that are also square numbers; e.g., 1, 36, 1225. Some of them can be generated by a simple recursive formula:
formula_27 with formula_28

&quot;All&quot; square triangular numbers are found from the recursion
formula_29 with formula_30 and formula_28

Also, the square of the th triangular number is the same as the sum of the cubes of the integers 1 to . This can also be expressed as
formula_32

The sum of the first triangular numbers is the th tetrahedral number:
formula_33

More generally, the difference between the th -gonal number and the th -gonal number is the th triangular number. For example, the sixth heptagonal number (81) minus the sixth hexagonal number (66) equals the fifth triangular number, 15. Every other triangular number is a hexagonal number. Knowing the triangular numbers, one can reckon any centered polygonal number; the th centered -gonal number is obtained by the formula
formula_34

where is a triangular number.

The positive difference of two triangular numbers is a trapezoidal number.

The pattern found for triangular numbers formula_35 and for tetrahedral numbers formula_36 which uses binomial coefficients, can be generalized. This leads to the formula:
formula_37
==Other properties==
Triangular numbers correspond to the first-degree case of Faulhaber&#x27;s formula.

Alternating triangular numbers (1, 6, 15, 28, ...) are also hexagonal numbers.

Every even perfect number is triangular (as well as hexagonal), given by the formula
formula_38
where is a Mersenne prime. No odd perfect numbers are known; hence, all known perfect numbers are triangular.

For example, the third triangular number is (3 × 2 =) 6, the seventh is (7 × 4 =) 28, the 31st is (31 × 16 =) 496, and the 127th is (127 × 64 =) 8128.

The final digit of a triangular number is 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, or 8, and thus such numbers never end in 2, 4, 7, or 9. A final 3 must be preceded by a 0 or 5; a final 8 must be preceded by a 2 or 7.

In base 10, the digital root of a nonzero triangular number is always 1, 3, 6, or 9. Hence, every triangular number is either divisible by three or has a remainder of 1 when divided by 9:
The digital root pattern for triangular numbers, repeating every nine terms, as shown above, is &quot;1, 3, 6, 1, 6, 3, 1, 9, 9&quot;.

The converse of the statement above is, however, not always true. For example, the digital root of 12, which is not a triangular number, is 3 and divisible by three.

If is a triangular number, is an odd square, and , then is also a triangular number. Note that will always be a triangular number, because , which yields all the odd squares are revealed by multiplying a triangular number by 8 and adding 1, and the process for given is an odd square is the inverse of this operation.
The first several pairs of this form (not counting ) are: , , , , , , ... etc. Given is equal to , these formulas yield , , , , and so on.

The sum of the reciprocals of all the nonzero triangular numbers is
formula_39

This can be shown by using the basic sum of a telescoping series:
formula_40

In addition, the &quot;n&quot;th partial sum of this series can be written as 

Two other formulas regarding triangular numbers are
formula_41
and
formula_42
both of which can easily be established either by looking at dot patterns (see above) or with some simple algebra. The first formula are relevant to multiplication algorithm#Quarter square multiplication.

In 1796, Gauss discovered that every positive integer is representable as a sum of three triangular numbers, writing in his diary his famous words, &quot;ΕΥΡΗΚΑ! &quot;. The three triangular numbers are not necessarily distinct, or nonzero; for example 20 = 10 + 10 + 0. This is a special case of the Fermat polygonal number theorem.

The largest triangular number of the form is 4095 (see Ramanujan–Nagell equation).

Wacław Franciszek Sierpiński posed the question as to the existence of four distinct triangular numbers in geometric progression. It was conjectured by Polish mathematician Kazimierz Szymiczek to be impossible and was later proven by Fang and Chen in 2007.

Formulas involving expressing an integer as the sum of triangular numbers are connected to theta functions, in particular the Ramanujan theta function.

The number of line segments between closest pairs of dots in the triangle can be represented in terms of the number of dots or with a recurrence relation:
formula_43

In the limit, the ratio between the two numbers, dots and line segments is
formula_44

==Applications==
The triangular number solves the handshake problem of counting the number of handshakes if each person in a room with people shakes hands once with each person. In other words, the solution to the handshake problem of people is . 

Equivalently, a fully connected network of computing devices requires the presence of cables or other connections.

In a tournament format that uses a round-robin group stage, the number of matches that need to be played between teams is equal to the triangular number . For example, a group stage with 4 teams requires 6 matches, and a group stage with 8 teams requires 28 matches. This is also equivalent to the handshake problem and fully connected network problems.
One way of calculating the depreciation of an asset is the sum-of-years&#x27; digits method, which involves finding , where is the length in years of the asset&#x27;s useful life. Each year, the item loses , where is the item&#x27;s beginning value (in units of currency), is its final salvage value, is the total number of years the item is usable, and the current year in the depreciation schedule. Under this method, an item with a usable life of = 4 years would lose of its &quot;losable&quot; value in the first year, in the second, in the third, and in the fourth, accumulating a total depreciation of (the whole) of the losable value.

Board game designers Geoffrey Engelstein and Isaac Shalev describe triangular numbers as having achieved &quot;nearly the status of a mantra or koan among game designers&quot;, describing them as &quot;deeply intuitive&quot; and &quot;featured in an enormous number of games, [proving] incredibly versatile at providing escalating rewards for larger sets without overly incentivizing specialization to the exclusion of all other strategies&quot;.
==Triangular roots and tests for triangular numbers==
By analogy with the square root of , one can define the (positive) triangular root of as the number such that :
formula_45

which follows immediately from the quadratic formula. So an integer is triangular if and only if is a square. Equivalently, if the positive triangular root of is an integer, then is the th triangular number.

==Alternative name==
By analogy with the factorial function, a product whose factors are the integers from 1 to , Donald Knuth proposed the name Termial function, with the notation ? for the sum whose terms are the integers from 1 to  (the th triangular number). Although some other sources use this name and notation, they are not in wide use.

<text>In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, 9 is a square number, since it equals and can be written as .

The usual notation for the square of a number is not the product , but the equivalent exponentiation , usually pronounced as &quot; squared&quot;. The name &quot;square&quot; number comes from the name of the shape. The unit of area is defined as the area of a unit square (). Hence, a square with side length has area . If a square number is represented by &quot;n&quot; points, the points can be arranged in rows as a square each side of which has the same number of points as the square root of &quot;n&quot;; thus, square numbers are a type of figurate numbers (other examples being cube numbers and triangular numbers).

In the real number system, square numbers are non-negative. A non-negative integer is a square number when its square root is again an integer. For example, formula_1 so 9 is a square number.

A positive integer that has no square divisors except 1 is called square-free.

For a non-negative integer , the th square number is , with being the zeroth one. The concept of square can be extended to some other number systems. If rational numbers are included, then a square is the ratio of two square integers, and, conversely, the ratio of two square integers is a square, for example, 
formula_2.

Starting with 1, there are formula_3 square numbers up to and including , where the expression formula_4 represents the floor of the number .

The difference between any perfect square and its predecessor is given by the identity . Equivalently, it is possible to count square numbers by adding together the last square, the last square&#x27;s root, and the current root, that is, .

==Properties==
The number &quot;m&quot; is a square number if and only if one can arrange &quot;m&quot; points in a square:
The expression for the th square number is . This is also equal to the sum of the first odd numbers as can be seen in the above pictures, where a square results from the previous one by adding an odd number of points (shown in magenta). The formula follows:formula_5For example, .

There are several recursive methods for computing square numbers. For example, the th square number can be computed from the previous square by . Alternatively, the th square number can be calculated from the previous two by doubling the th square, subtracting the th square number, and adding 2, because . For example,
The square minus one of a number is always the product of formula_6 and formula_7 that is,formula_8For example, since , one has formula_9. Since a prime number has factors of only and itself, and since is the only non-zero value of to give a factor of on the right side of the equation above, it follows that is the only prime number one less than a square ().

More generally, the difference of the squares of two numbers is the product of their sum and their difference. That is,formula_10This is the difference-of-squares formula, which can be useful for mental arithmetic: for example, can be easily computed as .
A square number is also the sum of two consecutive triangular numbers. The sum of two consecutive square numbers is a centered square number. Every odd square is also a centered octagonal number.

Another property of a square number is that (except 0) it has an odd number of positive divisors, while other natural numbers have an even number of positive divisors. An integer root is the only divisor that pairs up with itself to yield the square number, while other divisors come in pairs.

Lagrange&#x27;s four-square theorem states that any positive integer can be written as the sum of four or fewer perfect squares. Three squares are not sufficient for numbers of the form . A positive integer can be represented as a sum of two squares precisely if its prime factorization contains no odd powers of primes of the form . This is generalized by Waring&#x27;s problem.

In base 10, a square number can end only with digits 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 or 9, as follows:

* if the last digit of a number is 0, its square ends in 00;
* if the last digit of a number is 1 or 9, its square ends in an even digit followed by a 1;
* if the last digit of a number is 2 or 8, its square ends in an even digit followed by a 4;
* if the last digit of a number is 3 or 7, its square ends in an even digit followed by a 9;
* if the last digit of a number is 4 or 6, its square ends in an odd digit followed by a 6; and
* if the last digit of a number is 5, its square ends in 25.

In base 12, a square number can end only with square digits (like in base 12, a prime number can end only with prime digits or 1), that is, 0, 1, 4 or 9, as follows:

* if a number is divisible both by 2 and by 3 (that is, divisible by 6), its square ends in 0, and its preceding digit must be 0 or 3;
* if a number is divisible neither by 2 nor by 3, its square ends in 1, and its preceding digit must be even;
* if a number is divisible by 2, but not by 3, its square ends in 4, and its preceding digit must be 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, or 9; and
* if a number is not divisible by 2, but by 3, its square ends in 9, and its preceding digit must be 0 or 6.

Similar rules can be given for other bases, or for earlier digits (the tens instead of the units digit, for example). All such rules can be proved by checking a fixed number of cases and using modular arithmetic.

In general, if a prime  divides a square number  then the square of must also divide ; if fails to divide , then is definitely not square. Repeating the divisions of the previous sentence, one concludes that every prime must divide a given perfect square an even number of times (including possibly 0 times). Thus, the number is a square number if and only if, in its canonical representation, all exponents are even.

Squarity testing can be used as alternative way in factorization of large numbers. Instead of testing for divisibility, test for squarity: for given and some number , if is the square of an integer  then divides . (This is an application of the factorization of a difference of two squares.) For example, is the square of 3, so consequently divides 9991. This test is deterministic for odd divisors in the range from to where covers some range of natural numbers formula_11

A square number cannot be a perfect number.

The sum of the &quot;n&quot; first square numbers isformula_12The first values of these sums, the square pyramidal numbers, are: 

0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, 91, 140, 204, 285, 385, 506, 650, 819, 1015, 1240, 1496, 1785, 2109, 2470, 2870, 3311, 3795, 4324, 4900, 5525, 6201...
The sum of the first odd integers, beginning with one, is a perfect square: 1, 1 + 3, 1 + 3 + 5, 1 + 3 + 5 + 7, etc. This explains Galileo&#x27;s law of odd numbers: if a body falling from rest covers one unit of distance in the first arbitrary time interval, it covers 3, 5, 7, etc., units of distance in subsequent time intervals of the same length. From formula_13, for and constant (acceleration due to gravity without air resistance); so is proportional to , and the distance from the starting point are consecutive squares for integer values of time elapsed.

The sum of the &quot;n&quot; first cubes is the square of the sum of the &quot;n&quot; first positive integers; this is Nicomachus&#x27;s theorem.

All fourth powers, sixth powers, eighth powers and so on are perfect squares.

A unique relationship with triangular numbers formula_14 is:formula_15

==Odd and even square numbers== 

Squares of even numbers are even, and are divisible by 4, since . Squares of odd numbers are odd, and are congruent to 1 modulo 8, since , and is always even. In other words, all odd square numbers have a remainder of 1 when divided by 8.

Every odd perfect square is a centered octagonal number. The difference between any two odd perfect squares is a multiple of 8. The difference between 1 and any higher odd perfect square always is eight times a triangular number, while the difference between 9 and any higher odd perfect square is eight times a triangular number minus eight. Since all triangular numbers have an odd factor, but no two values of differ by an amount containing an odd factor, the only perfect square of the form is 1, and the only perfect square of the form is 9.

==Special cases==
* If the number is of the form where represents the preceding digits, its square is where and represents digits before 25. For example, the square of 65 can be calculated by which makes the square equal to 4225.
* If the number is of the form where represents the preceding digits, its square is where . For example, the square of 70 is 4900.
* If the number has two digits and is of the form where represents the units digit, its square is where and . For example, to calculate the square of 57, and and , so .
* If the number ends in 5, its square will end in 5; similarly for ending in 25, 625, 0625, 90625, ... 8212890625, etc. If the number ends in 6, its square will end in 6, similarly for ending in 76, 376, 9376, 09376, ... 1787109376. For example, the square of 55376 is 3066501376, both ending in &quot;376&quot;. (The numbers 5, 6, 25, 76, etc. are called automorphic numbers. They are sequence in the OEIS.)
* In base 10, the last two digits of square numbers follow a repeating pattern mirrored symmetrical around multiples of 25. In the example of 24 and 26, both 1 off from 25, and , both ending in 76. In general, formula_16. An analogous pattern applies for the last 3 digits around multiples of 250, and so on. As a consequence, of the 100 possible last 2 digits, only 22 of them occur among square numbers (since 00 and 25 are repeated).

<text>Charles Knight (15 March 1791 – 9 March 1873) was an English publisher, editor and author. He published and contributed to works such as &quot;The Penny Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Penny Cyclopaedia&quot;, and &quot;The English Cyclopaedia&quot;, and established the &quot;Local Government Chronicle&quot;.

==Early life==
The son of a bookseller and printer at Windsor, he was apprenticed to his father. On completion of his indentures he took up journalism and had an interest in several newspaper speculations, including the &quot;Windsor, Slough and Eton Express&quot;.

In 1823, in conjunction with friends he had made as publisher (1820–1821) of &quot;The Etonian&quot;, he started &quot;Knight&#x27;s Quarterly Magazine&quot;, to which Winthrop Mackworth Praed, Derwent Coleridge and Thomas Macaulay contributed. It lasted for only six issues, but it made Knight&#x27;s name as publisher and author, beginning a career which lasted over forty years. The periodical included an 1824 review of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; in which Percy Bysshe Shelley was attributed as the author in a comparison with his wife&#x27;s second novel &quot;Valperga&quot;. One of his early publications was the diary of the naval chaplain Henry Teonge (c. 1620–1690). From 1826 to 1827, he published the second series of Alaric Alexander Watts&#x27; monthly magazine &quot;The Literary Magnet&quot;.

==Editor==

In 1827 Knight was forced to give up publishing, and became the superintendent of the publications of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, for which he projected and edited &quot;The British Almanack and Companion&quot;, begun in 1828. In 1829 he resumed business on his own account with the publication of &quot;The Library of Entertaining Knowledge&quot;, writing several volumes of the series himself. In 1832 and 1833 he started &quot;The Penny Magazine&quot; (1832-1845) and &quot;The Penny Cyclopaedia&quot;. Both sold well, the &quot;Penny Magazine&quot; with a circulation of 200,000 by the end of its first year. &quot;The Penny Cyclopaedia&quot;, as a result of the heavy excise duty on paper, was only completed in 1844 at a financial loss of £40,000.

He edited and published &quot;London&quot; (1841) in three volumes, a heavily illustrated history of the city.

Besides many illustrated editions of standard works, including in 1842 an edition of the works of William Shakespeare entitled &quot;The Pictorial Shakspere&quot;, which had appeared in parts (1838–1841), Knight published a variety of illustrated works, such as &quot;Old England&quot;, &quot;The Land We Live In&quot; and &quot;The Pictorial Gallery of Arts&quot; (Useful Arts; Fine Arts), the latter based on the Great Exhibition of 1851. He also undertook the series known as &quot;Knight&#x27;s Weekly Volume for All Readers&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;Knight&#x27;s Weekly Volumes&quot;) himself contributing the first volume, a biography of William Caxton (1844), as well as one on Sir Thomas Gresham (1845). Many famous books, Harriet Martineau&#x27;s &quot;Tales&quot;, Anna Brownell Jameson&#x27;s &quot;Early Italian Painters&quot; and G. H. Lewes&#x27;s &quot;Biographical History of Philosophy&quot;, appeared for the first time in this series.

His zeal for popular instruction saw him publish &quot;The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge&quot; (1847-1851) in 12 volumes, and, &quot;The English Encyclopaedia: A Dictionary of Useful Knowledge&quot; (1854-1862) in 22 volumes, with a 4 volume supplement. The latter work essentially a revision of &quot;The Penny Cyclopaedia&quot;. Knight also launched the &quot;Local Government Chronicle&quot; in 1855, and at about the same time he began his &quot;Popular History of England&quot; (8 vols., 1856–1862).

==Author==
In addition to being the editor and author of &quot;Penny Magazine&quot; and &quot;Penny Cyclopedia&quot;, and other popular works, Knight wrote &quot;The Results of Machinery&quot; (1831) and &quot;Knowledge is Power&quot;, which was published in 1855. 
&quot;A Popular History of England&quot; over eight volumes appeared in 1856. In 1864 he withdrew from the business of publishing, but he continued to write nearly to the close of his long life, authoring &quot;The Shadows of the Old Booksellers&quot; (1865), an autobiography under the title &quot;Passages of a Working Life during Half a Century&quot; (2 vols., 1864–1865), and an historical novel, &quot;Begg&#x27;d at Court&quot; (1867).

==Inventor==
In 1838 Knight took out a patent for, &quot;improvements in the process and in the apparatus used in the production of coloured impressions on paper, vellum, parchment and pasteboard by surface printing.&quot;

==Legacy==
Charles Knight died at Addlestone, Surrey on 9 March 1873. A gateway was erected in his memory at the cemetery adjacent to Bachelors Acre in Windsor, where he was buried. He is considered to be the first person to propose the use of stamped newspaper wrappers in 1834, thus is attributed as their inventor.

His many reference books intended for a general audience mark him out as a pioneer in self-improvement.

<doc id="213923" wikidata="Q5794619" url="?curid=213923" title="William Carew Hazlitt">
<text>William Carew Hazlitt (22 August 18348 September 1913), known professionally as W. Carew Hazlitt, was an English lawyer, bibliographer, editor and writer. He was the son of the barrister and registrar William Hazlitt, a grandson of the essayist and critic William Hazlitt, and a great-grandson of the Unitarian minister and author William Hazlitt. William Carew Hazlitt was educated at the Merchant Taylors&#x27; School and was called to the bar of the Inner Temple in 1861.

== Works ==
Among Hazlitt&#x27;s many publications are &quot;Handbook to the Popular, Poetical and Dramatic Literature of Great Britain: From the Invention of Printing to the Restoration&quot; (1867). Hazlitt published further contributions to the subject in &quot;Bibliographical Collections and Notes on Early English Literature, Made During the Years 1893–1903&quot; (1903), and a &quot;Manual for the Collector and Amateur of Old English Plays ...&quot; (1892). He was also the chief editor of an edition of Warton&#x27;s &quot;History of English Poetry&quot; (1871) and compiled the &quot;Catalogue of the Huth Library&quot; (1880).

He edited &quot;A Select Collection of Old English Plays&quot;, 4th edition (London: Reeves and Turner, 1874–76), which had been originally published by Dodsley in 1744.

He also published &quot;Collections and Notes, 1867-1876&quot; (London: Reeves &amp; Turner, 1876, containing detailed bibliographical entries on many early English printed books) followed by &quot;Bibliographical Collections and Notes on Early English Literature 1474-1700: Second Supplement&quot; (1882).

In 1897 Hazlitt published his autobiography under the title &quot;The Confessions of a Collector&quot;.

In 1875, he published an edition of the works of Thomas Randolph. In 1877 he published a new edition of Charles Cotton&#x27;s translation of Montaigne&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot;.

He also published &quot;The History of the Venetian Republic: Her Rise, Her Greatness, and Her Civilization&quot; (1860) and &quot;Old Cookery Books and Ancient Cuisine&quot; (1886).

Of great use, historical interest and delight to gardeners and collectors of herbals, etc., is his &quot;Gleanings in Old Garden Literature&quot;, published by Elliot Stock, London, 1887, in &quot;The Book-Lover&#x27;s Library&quot;. This book includes, in its final chapter, a &quot;Bibliography of Gardening Literature, 1603–1800, and of Herbals and Bee Culture&quot;. The book focuses on European gardening and British adoptions and modifications thereof from the 15th through the 17th century.

Compendious in scope and idiosyncratic in selection is his , which preserves evidence of numerous folk customs now extinct.

<text>Mikhail Alekseevich Kuzmin () ( – March 1, 1936) was a Russian poet, musician and novelist, as well as a prominent contributor to the Silver Age of Russian Poetry.

==Biography==
Born into a noble family in Yaroslavl, Kuzmin grew up in St. Petersburg and studied music at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory under Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. He did not graduate, however, later explaining his move towards poetry thus: &quot;It&#x27;s easier and simpler. Poetry falls ready-made from the sky, like manna into the mouths of the Israelites in the desert.&quot; Despite this Kuzmin did not give up music; he composed the music for Meyerhold&#x27;s famous 1906 production of Alexander Blok&#x27;s play &quot;Balaganchik&quot; (The Fair Show Booth), and his songs were popular among the Petersburg elite: &quot;He sang them, accompanying himself on the piano, first in various salons, including Ivanov&#x27;s Tower, and then at The Stray Dog. Kuzmin liked to say of his work that &#x27;it&#x27;s only little music, but it has its poison.&#x27;&quot;

One of his closest friends and major influences as a young man was the polyglot Germanophile aristocrat Georgy Chicherin (who later entered the diplomatic service and after the October Revolution became People&#x27;s Commissar of Foreign Affairs), a passionate supporter of Wagner and Nietzsche. Another strong influence was his travels, first to Egypt and Italy and then to northern Russia, where he was deeply impressed by the Old Believers. Settling down in St. Petersburg, he became close to the circle around &quot;Mir iskusstva&quot; (World of Art). His first published writings appeared in 1905 and attracted the attention of Valery Bryusov, who invited him to contribute to his influential literary magazine &quot;Vesy&quot; (The Balance), the center of the Symbolist movement, where in 1906 he published his verse cycle &quot;Alexandrian Songs&quot; (modeled on Les Chansons de Bilitis, by Pierre Louÿs) and the first Russian novel with a homosexual theme, &quot;Wings&quot;, which instantly achieved notoriety and made him a widely popular writer. In 1908 appeared his first collection of poetry, &quot;Seti&quot; (Nets), which was also widely acclaimed. In the words of Roberta Reeder, &quot;His poetry is erudite and the themes range from Ancient Greece and Alexandria to modern-day Petersburg.&quot;

In 1908 he was living with Sergei Sudeikin and his first wife Olga Glebova, whom he had married just the year before; when Olga discovered her husband was having an affair with Kuzmin she insisted Kuzmin move out. &quot;But in spite of this contretemps, Kuzmin, Sudeikin, and Glebova continued to maintain a productive, professional relationship, collaborating on many ventures—plays, musical evenings, poetry declamations—especially at the St. Petersburg cabarets.&quot; Kuzmin was also one of the favorite poets of Sudeikin&#x27;s second wife, Vera, and her published album contains several of his manuscript poems.

Kuzmin met Yuri Yurkun, a poet, in 1913. The two men lived together with Yurkun&#x27;s mother, and Yurkun’s wife, Olga Arbenina, joined them, for a short while. Kuzmin and Yurkun&#x27;s relationship lasted until Kuzmin&#x27;s death. Kuzmin died in 1936 of pneumonia, two years before Yurkun and many other writers were arrested under the by Soviet authorities and shot.

Kuzmin&#x27;s association with the Symbolists was never definitive, and in 1910 he helped give rise to the Acmeist movement with his essay &quot;O prekrasnoi yasnosti&quot; (On beautiful clarity), in which he attacked &quot;incomprehensible, dark cosmic trappings&quot; and urged writers to be &quot;logical in the conception, the construction of the work, the syntax... love the word, like Flaubert, be economical in means and niggardly in words, precise and genuine -- and you will find the secret of an amazing thing — beautiful clarity — which I would call clarism.&quot; He was no more a member of the group than he had been of the Symbolists, but he was personally associated with a number of them; in the years 1910-12 he lived in the famous apartment (called the Tower) of Vyacheslav Ivanov, who was another formative influence on the Acmeists, and he was a friend of Anna Akhmatova, for whose first book of poetry, &quot;Vecher&quot; [Evening], he wrote a flattering preface. (In later years Kuzmin incurred Akhmatova&#x27;s enmity, probably because of a 1923 review she took as condescending, and she made him a prototype of one of the villains in her &quot;Poem Without a Hero&quot;.)

The last volume of poetry Kuzmin published during his lifetime was &quot;The Trout Breaks the Ice&quot; (1929), a cycle of narrative poetry.

In the 1920s and 1930s Kuzmin made his living primarily as a literary translator, most notably of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. He died in poverty in Leningrad.

==Legacy==
Contemporary poet and critic Alexei Purin thinks the openly &quot;tragic,&quot; socially oriented tradition of Russian literature has been exhausted and it needed to reorient itself along the more personal and artistic tradition exemplified by Kuzmin and Vladimir Nabokov. He quotes Innokenty Annensky as saying it was important to avoid &quot;the persistent embrace of the &#x27;like everyone&#x27;&quot; and writes: &quot;It is precisely the poetry of Annensky and Kuzmin that at the beginning of the twentieth century took the first and decisive step away from this &#x27;like everyone&#x27; — in the direction of psychologically interpreted details and the everyday word, in the direction of living intonation — a step to be compared, perhaps, only with the Pushkin revolution. All succeeding Russian lyric poetry is unimaginable without it.&quot;

Mandelstam, in his 1916 review &quot;On Contemporary Poetry,&quot; wrote:Kuzmin&#x27;s classicism is captivating. How sweet it is to read a classical poet living in our midst, to experience a Goethean blend of &quot;form&quot; and &quot;content,&quot; to be persuaded that the soul is not a substance
made of metaphysical cotton, but rather the carefree, gentle Psyche. Kuzmin&#x27;s poems not only lend themselves easily to memorization, but also to recall, as it were (the impression of recollection after the very first reading), and they float up to the surface as if out of oblivion (Classicism)...And in his essay &quot;A Letter about Russian Poetry&quot; (1922), he said &quot;Kuzmin brought dissident songs from the Volga shores, an Italian comedy from his own native Rome, and the entire history of European culture insofar as it had become music—from Giorgione&#x27;s &quot;Concert&quot; at the Pitti Palace to the most recent tone poems of Debussy.&quot;

<doc id="213926" wikidata="Q1565841" url="?curid=213926" title="HP Sauce">
<text>HP Sauce is a British brown sauce, the main ingredients of which are tomatoes, malt vinegar and molasses. It was named after London&#x27;s Houses of Parliament. After making its first appearance on British dinner tables in the late 19th century, HP Sauce went on to become an icon of British culture. It was the best-selling brand of brown sauce in the UK in 2005, with 73.8% of the retail market. The sauce was originally produced in the United Kingdom, but is now made by Heinz in the Netherlands. 

HP Sauce has a tomato base, blended with malt vinegar and spirit vinegar, sugars (molasses, glucose-fructose syrup, sugar), dates, cornflour, rye flour, salt, spices and tamarind. It is used as a condiment with hot and cold savoury food, and as an ingredient in soups and stews.

The picture on the front of the bottle is a selection of London landmarks including Elizabeth Tower, the Palace of Westminster, and Westminster Bridge.

==History==
Frederick Gibson Garton had a grocers and provisions shop on Milton Street, in Nottingham. He used this recipe for the brown sauce in his pickles and sauce factory in New Basford. This was located at the rear of his home in Sandon Street. Its ingredients included vinegar, water, tomato puree, garlic, tamarind, ground mace, cloves and ginger, shallots, cayenne pepper, raisins, soy, flour and salt. Garton registered the name H.P. Sauce in 1895, choosing it because he had heard a rumour that a restaurant in the Houses of Parliament had begun serving it. The sauce bottle labels carried a picture of the Houses of Parliament. This was by no means his only product. He also made Nottingham Sauce, Sandon Sauce, Worcester Sauce, Banquet Sauce, Yorkshire Sauce and Daddies Favourite Sauce, as well as Garton &amp; Co&#x27;s Indian Chutney.

In 1899 he was unable to settle a debt with his vinegar suppliers, the Midland Vinegar Company of Aston Cross, Birmingham. Edwin Samson Moore of the vinegar company visited his Nottingham premises to settle the matter. The outcome was that Garton handed over the name and recipe for HP Sauce - for just £150. He also had to agree to keep out of the Sauce and Pickles business. The name of GARTON remained on the bottles of HP sauce for many years afterwards but it was The Midland Vinegar Company who profited from the huge sales that were generated. Today HP and Daddies are the two most popular national brands of brown sauce. They can both trace their origins to a tiny premises in Sandon Street, Basford, Nottinghamshire.

For many years the bottle labels have carried a picture of the Houses of Parliament.

In the United Kingdom, HP Sauce became informally known as &quot;Wilson&#x27;s gravy&quot; in the 1960s and 1970s, after Mary Wilson, the wife of Prime Minister Harold Wilson, gave an interview to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, in which she said: &quot;If Harold has a fault, it is that he will drown everything with HP Sauce.&quot;

===Heinz takeover===

The brand passed from the Midlands Vinegar Company to Smedley HP Foods Limited, which was subsequently acquired by a division of Imperial Tobacco, before being sold to the French Groupe Danone SA in 1998 for £199 million.

In June 2005, Heinz purchased the parent company, HP Foods, from Danone. In October of that year the United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading referred the takeover to the Competition Commission, which approved the £440 million acquisition in April 2006.

In May 2006, Heinz announced plans to switch production of HP Sauce from Aston in Birmingham to its European sauces facility in Elst, Netherlands, only weeks after HP launched a campaign to &quot;Save the Proper British Cafe&quot;. The announcement caused backlash and prompted a call to boycott Heinz products. The move, resulting in the loss of approximately 125 jobs at the Aston factory, was criticised by politicians and union officials, especially as the owner still wanted to use the image of the House of Commons on its bottles. In the same month, local Labour MP Khalid Mahmood brandished a bottle of HP Sauce during Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions in the House of Commons as part of a protest against the Heinz move. He also made reference to the sauce&#x27;s popularity with the former Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson. These plans were confirmed on 23 August 2006 and the factory at Aston ceased production on 16 March 2007. A week later a &quot;wake&quot; was held at the location of the factory.

The factory was demolished in the summer of 2007.

The six-acre Aston site was purchased by developer Chancerygate in 2007 at £800,000 per acre; they subsequently sold it for half that price and it now houses a distribution warehouse for East End Foods.

<text>Anthony Nomar Garciaparra (; born July 23, 1973) is an American former Major League Baseball player and current SportsNet LA analyst. After playing parts of nine seasons as an All-Star shortstop for the Boston Red Sox, he played shortstop, third base and first base for the Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers, and the Oakland Athletics. Garciaparra is one of 13 players in Major League history to hit two grand slams during a single game, and the only player to achieve the feat at his home stadium.

Garciaparra is a six-time All-Star (1997, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2006), and was the AL Rookie of the Year and AL Silver Slugger Award winner at shortstop in 1997. In 2001, he suffered a wrist injury, the first in a series of significant injuries that plagued the remainder of his career. Known for his ability to hit for average, Garciaparra is a lifetime .313 hitter. He had the highest single-season batting average by a right-handed batter in the post-war era, batting .372 in 2000, and won the AL Batting Title in 1999 and 2000, the first right-handed batter to accomplish this in consecutive seasons since Joe DiMaggio.

==Early years==
Garciaparra, who is of Mexican-American descent, was born in Whittier, California and attended St. John Bosco High School in Bellflower, California. His middle name comes from his father, Ramon; Nomar is &quot;Ramon&quot; spelled backwards. When Nomar was a young boy, his father stressed the importance of not striking out, offering him 25 cents for each hit in tee ball and fining him 50 cents for every strikeout. When Nomar was 13, Ramon once put him in a batting cage against a college pitcher who could throw . After missing the first pitch, Nomar proceeded to hit solid line drives on the next two pitches. As a boy, Nomar was nicknamed &quot;No Nonsense Nomar&quot; for his methodical and tireless preparation as an athlete.

The Milwaukee Brewers selected Garciaparra in the fifth round of the 1991 draft, however, he did not sign. Instead, he enrolled at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he played college baseball for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. Garciaparra helped the Yellow Jackets reach the College World Series title game in 1994; they lost to Oklahoma. Garciaparra was an Atlantic Coast Conference All-Star and a first team All-American twice in 1993–94. He batted .427 in his final season at Georgia Tech. In 1992 Garciaparra played on the United States Olympic Baseball team in the Summer Olympics in Barcelona. In 1993, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Orleans Cardinals of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL). Garciaparra batted .321 and led Orleans to the league championship. He was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame in 2002.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
Following his career at Georgia Tech, Garciaparra was a first round draft pick of the Red Sox in 1994, and entered the Red Sox farm system. He began his professional career in Class A Advanced, as a member of the Sarasota Red Sox following his NCAA season. Since the season was already well underway by the point Garciaparra joined the team, he only appeared in 28 games. However, he batted .295 and hit his first professional home run. In 1995, Garciaparra moved up to join the Double-A Trenton Thunder. In 125 games, he batted .267 with eight home runs and again walked more than he struck out. He also showcased his speed, stealing 35 bases, and continued gathering experience at shortstop. After the 1995 season, rather than go home, Garciaparra embarked on an ambitious off-season training regimen to add 15 pounds of muscle. In 1996, he found himself at the highest level of the minors playing for the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox. That season, Garciaparra batted .343 with 16 home runs and 46 RBI in just 43 games and earned a late-season call up to the Major Leagues.

===Boston Red Sox (1996–2004)===
====1996–1997====
Garciaparra made his Major League debut on August 31, 1996, as a defensive replacement against Oakland, going 0-for-1. His first Major League hit was a home run off Oakland pitcher John Wasdin on September 1, a game in which Garciaparra recorded three hits. Garciaparra batted .241 with four home runs, 16 RBI, and five stolen bases in his initial stint with the club at the end of 1996. On September 18, 1996, Garciaparra stole his first major league base against the Tigers, which happened on the same night where Roger Clemens tied his own MLB record for striking out 20 batters in a game.

When he returned in 1997, Garciaparra set the league on fire in his rookie season. He hit 30 home runs among his 209 base hits (a Red Sox rookie record), and drove in 98 runs, setting a new MLB record for RBIs by a leadoff hitter and most homers by a rookie shortstop. He also batted .306, and his 30-game hitting streak set an A.L. rookie record. Garciaparra also stole 22 bases, and his 11 triples led the league. He was named Rookie of the Year in a unanimous vote, competed in the Home Run Derby as well as his first MLB All-Star Game, finished eighth in MVP voting, and captured the Silver Slugger Award for AL Shortstop. He also won the immediate admiration of Red Sox fans, who referred to him in Boston accents as &quot;NO-mah!&quot;.

====1998–2000====
In the spring of 1998, Garciaparra and the Red Sox signed a five-year contract worth $23.25 million. The deal also included two team options (for 2003 and 2004) that, if exercised, would boost the deal to $44.25 million. At the time, it was unprecedented for a team to sign a player who had just completed his rookie season to a long-term contract. Once the 1998 season started, Garciaparra moved down in the batting order, typically batting third or cleanup. He finished with 35 home runs and 122 RBI in 1998, and was the runner-up for AL MVP. His batting average of .323 was good for sixth in the AL among qualifiers.

Both he and teammate Pedro Martínez were instrumental in leading the Red Sox to the postseason. Though the team lost to the Cleveland Indians in the 1998 American League Division Series, Garciaparra had an outstanding postseason debut in the series, batting .333 with 3 homers and 11 RBI in the four-game loss. He hit a memorable three-run home run in the fifth inning of Game 1, the only game in the series the Red Sox won.

Garciaparra then continued to come into his own in 1999, winning the batting title by hitting .357 (including .400 against left-handed pitchers). He reached the century mark in RBIs once again, with 27 home runs and 104 batted in over the course of only 135 games. On May 10, he hit three home runs, including two grand slams, and drove in 10 RBI in a game against the Seattle Mariners. He was named an MLB All-Star in 1999, earning the right to start at shortstop and bat second for the game which took place in front of his hometown fans at Boston&#x27;s Fenway Park. Again, he led the Red Sox to the postseason, where they defeated the Indians in five games in the 1999 American League Division Series, and Nomar was again a key cog, despite battling injury as he hit .417 in the four games he was able to appear in. Garciaparra became the first player in MLB history to hit safely and score a run in the first five games of his post-season career (1998–99), a feat completed in Game 1 of the 1999 ALDS. He is since joined by Ian Kinsler (2010) as the only other player to start his post-season career in that manner. Against the New York Yankees in the 1999 American League Championship Series, Garciaparra was again at his finest, hitting .400 with two home runs, but the team lost in five games. After the season, he finished seventh in MVP voting.

The year 2000 was a year of transition for the Red Sox, but very little changed for Nomar. By the end of June, his average was sitting at .396, prompting some to speculate he might be the first batter to hit .400 since Ted Williams. Indeed, Garciaparra did reach the mark, batting .403 as late in the season as July 20. However, as the summer went on, Garciaparra&#x27;s batting average slipped from those lofty heights. He finished the season with a .372 batting average, which was the highest batting average by a right-handed batter in the post-war era. Garciaparra also easily won the American League batting title, becoming the first right-handed batter to win consecutive titles in the American League since Joe DiMaggio. He also homered 21 times and drove in 96 runs. Despite the strong individual play, the Red Sox missed the postseason in 2000.

====2001====
In February 2001, a shirtless and muscular Garciaparra appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, with the headline &quot;A Cut Above... baseball&#x27;s toughest out&quot;. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; later described the cover photo as &quot;controversial&quot;, adding that it &quot;forever fueled the inevitable speculation of steroid usage&quot;. Baseball fans looked forward to see if he might challenge the .400 mark, and Red Sox fans hoped he would lead them back to the postseason with new acquisition Manny Ramirez. However, the week after the issue hit newsstands, Garciaparra aggravated an old wrist injury and had to start the season on the disabled list.

He did not play in his first game during 2001 until July 29, though he hit a memorable home run on his return in that game. However, by the end of August, the wrist acted up yet again, and Garciaparra missed the rest of the season due to the injury. He only saw action in 21 games, batting .289 with 4 homers and 8 RBI during the shortened campaign. Many believe that the wrist injury not only ruined his season, but altered the trajectory of his career. Before the 2001 season, Scott Boras had run a statistical study of Garciaparra for his own client (Alex Rodriguez) predicting that by age 40, Nomar would hit 513 home runs, have 3,581 hits, and have .336 career batting average.

====2002–03====

By the start of the 2002 season, Garciaparra had recovered from his wrist injury. He posted a .310 mark in 2002, homering 24 times, and driving in 120 runs. His 56 doubles led the league. On July 23 (his 29th birthday), he homered three times and drove in eight runs in the first game of a doubleheader against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. On September 2, Garciaparra recorded his 1,000th hit in his 745th game, becoming the fastest Red Sox player to the milestone, in a game against the New York Yankees. Garciaparra was recognized by baseball in making his fourth MLB All-Star Game, and he finished 11th in AL MVP voting at the end of the season. That season, Garciaparra played in 156 games, the highest single season total of his career. However, even with Nomar helping the team win 93 games during the season, the Red Sox did not qualify for the postseason.

Before the 2002 season, a new ownership group purchased the Red Sox. Contract extension negotiations between Garciaparra&#x27;s agent (Arn Tellem) and Red Sox brass went on during the offseason, but an agreement could not be reached. Though the sides agreed on a four-year, $60 million deal, the sticking point was the $8 million signing bonus Garciaparra requested. Garciaparra entered the 2003 season without a new pact. In 2003, Garciaparra had another productive All-Star season. On April 20, he hit a walk-off home run to give the Red Sox a 6–5 win over the Toronto Blue Jays. He batted .319 over the season&#x27;s first half, earning yet another All-Star selection, but a late season slump caused him to finish at .301. His 28 home runs were the most he had hit in a single season since 1998, and he drove in 105 runs. He appeared in 156 games again, tying his career high from the previous year. The Red Sox returned to MLB&#x27;s postseason for the first time since 1999, largely due to a potent lineup that featured Garciaparra, Manny Ramirez, and David Ortiz.

Additionally, new stars and cult heroes, led by Kevin Millar, began to emerge in Boston. Garciaparra&#x27;s September slump (he batted .170 during the month) followed him into the postseason. While he hit .300 in the 2003 American League Division Series against the Oakland Athletics, he did not drive in a run. The Red Sox won the series in five games to face the rival Yankees in the ALCS, where Garciaparra fared even worse. In the tense seven-game series, Garciaparra batted only .241 with just one RBI and an uncharacteristic eight strikeouts. However, he did record a memorable hit in Game 6, tripling and scoring on an error in the top of the seventh inning. At the time, Boston was down 6–4 and facing elimination, but the hit started a rally that saw the Red Sox come back and win 9–6 to force a Game 7. However, the Red Sox lost that game and the series on Aaron Boone&#x27;s infamous extra-inning walk-off home run.

With Garciaparra&#x27;s contract situation still not settled, Red Sox management explored trading Manny Ramírez to the Texas Rangers for shortstop Alex Rodriguez after the 2003 season. Simultaneously, the team had exploratory talks with the Chicago White Sox about trading Garciaparra for Magglio Ordóñez if the Alex Rodriguez trade was finalized. The Nomar talks had been intended to be covert but quickly leaked out, angering Garciaparra and his agent. In the end, the MLB Players Association objected to Rodriguez&#x27; willingness to sacrifice a huge amount of his $250 million contract to facilitate a deal to Boston, so both deals were shut down. After Aaron Boone injured his knee playing off-season basketball, it was the rival Yankees who instead acquired Rodriguez. Garciaparra thus returned to Boston for the start of the 2004 season in the final year of the old contract from March 1998, without an extension, and it quickly became clear that he was displeased with the team&#x27;s handling of the situation. It was believed by Red Sox brass that Nomar would not return to Boston when his contract expired after the 2004 season.

====2004====
The 2004 season began with Garciaparra&#x27;s future in Boston unresolved. Complicating matters was an Achilles&#x27; injury that kept him out until June. When he returned, Garciaparra continued to hit well, batting .321 with five home runs and 21 RBI in 38 games. On July 10, 2004, in a 14–6 win over the Rangers, Garciaparra went 4-for-5 with three runs batted in and fell a triple shy of the cycle. However, his defense saw a significant decline, primarily in his fielding range, which was believed to be due to the effects of his injury. General Manager Theo Epstein believed defense was the team&#x27;s weak point, and felt he needed to improve it for Boston to have any shot at winning a World Series. Additionally, the nature of Garciaparra&#x27;s injury required him to get frequent days off, which meant his bat was not even guaranteed to be in the lineup every day (and thus the weaker bats of the backup players would be during a pennant race). Finally, at the July 31, 2004, trading deadline, Boston decided to trade away Garciaparra. Garciaparra finished his Red Sox career with a .323 average, 178 home runs, and 690 RBI over parts of nine seasons.

===Chicago Cubs (2004–05)===
====2004–05====

On July 31, 2004 (the MLB trading deadline), Garciaparra was the key player involved in a four-team deal that sent him and Matt Murton to the wild-card-leading Chicago Cubs. The Red Sox received shortstop Orlando Cabrera from the Montreal Expos and first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz from the Minnesota Twins. Nomar expressed his appreciation to Red Sox fans in a speech to the media and left for Chicago. At first, Garciaparra was assigned jersey number 8, because Cub catcher Michael Barrett wore number 5, but a few days later, they switched numbers. Garciaparra drove in three runs in his first three games as a Cub. However, he continued to battle his Achilles&#x27; injury down the stretch, and in 43 games after the trade, he hit .297 with 4 home runs and 20 RBI in Chicago. Combined, his 2004 totals were a .308 average, nine home runs, and 41 RBI.

The Cubs led the wild card until mid-September, but finished the 2004 season with 89 wins and out of the playoffs. Meanwhile, the Red Sox finally overcame the Yankees en route to a World Series sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals, after which Garciaparra&#x27;s former teammates voted to give him a World Series ring and three-fourths of a playoff share ($167,715). Curt Schilling noted that if not for Garciaparra, the Red Sox might not have been in a position to win at all, clearly referencing the role Garciaparra&#x27;s ascension as a player had in drawing talent like Pedro Martínez, Manny Ramirez, and even himself to Boston.

After the season, Garciaparra was unable to get the long-term contract he had hoped for. His injury was the most significant reason why, as it was apparent he could still hit when healthy. So in the offseason, Garciaparra signed a 1-year deal worth $8.25 million to remain with the Cubs. Once the 2005 season began, a torn left groin forced him onto the disabled list in late April for more than three months. At the time of the injury, Garciaparra was hitting just .157. On April 23, 2005, following the publication of an op-ed in which &quot;Boston Globe&quot; columnist Bob Ryan speculated that Garciaparra&#x27;s many injuries might be caused by steroid use, Garciaparra &quot;flatly denied&quot; having used steroids and called the speculation &quot;ridiculous&quot;. Garciaparra resumed play on August 5, 2005 and almost immediately began raising his batting average. In late August, when Cubs regular third baseman Aramis Ramírez went on the disabled list for the remainder of the 2005 season, Garciaparra volunteered to play third base, and Cubs manager Dusty Baker agreed. Aside from his first game in the Majors, where he played second base, Nomar had played shortstop in all of his other Major League games up to that point in his career. Garciaparra finished 2005 with a .283 average, nine homers, and 30 RBI, and again became a free agent.

===Los Angeles Dodgers (2006–08)===
====2006====

In 2006, Garciaparra returned to his hometown, signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers, near Garciaparra&#x27;s childhood home in Whittier. The contract was again a one-year deal that Garciaparra hoped would lead to a multi-year offer following a strong season. The contract was worth $6 million, with another $2.5 million in performance bonuses. Also part of the lure of the Dodgers was that former Red Sox players Bill Mueller and Derek Lowe, and former manager Grady Little, were already with the team. Though he was able to retain his original jersey number (5), he moved to first base, as the Dodgers had also signed Rafael Furcal from the Atlanta Braves to step in for the recovering César Izturis at shortstop.

Healthy for the first extended period of time since 2003, Garciaparra regained his offensive stroke. On June 6, while facing the New York Mets Nomar hit a two-run home run on the first pitch he ever saw against former teammate and fellow Boston icon Pedro Martínez. Coincidentally, Derek Lowe was the starting pitcher for the Dodgers that day. Just days later, on June 9, Garciaparra&#x27;s batting average stood at .370. On June 25, he hit his 200th career home run against the Pittsburgh Pirates. By the MLB All-Star Break, Nomar was tied with Pittsburgh&#x27;s Freddy Sanchez for the lead in batting average among all MLB infielders and all NL batters with a .358 batting average, to go along with 11 home runs and 53 RBIs, and carrying a 21-game hitting streak into the break. It was the second highest batting average entering the All-Star Break by a Dodger since they moved into Dodger Stadium in 1962, with the only higher mark being held by Mike Piazza (.363 in 1996). Garciaparra was rewarded for his strong first half with his sixth All-Star selection. The selection came as the National League All-Star Final Vote winner, as he received about six million fan votes to earn the honor. It was his first All-Star appearance since 2003, and his first selection at any position other than shortstop.

Nomar adjusted well to playing first base, only committing one error through his first 588.2 innings played, and finishing with four for the entire season. However, his lofty batting average steadily declined to .303 by the end of the season as nagging injuries returned. Despite this, he prevailed in the clutch for the Dodgers during their playoff race with two game-winning home runs. The first capped off one of the most remarkable games of the season on September 18, as the Dodgers hit four consecutive home runs in the ninth inning against the San Diego Padres to tie the game. After the Padres scored a run in the tenth inning, Garciaparra hit a game-winning, two-run walk-off home run in the bottom of the 10th inning to win the game 11–10. Six days later on September 24, Garciaparra hit a game-winning grand slam against the Arizona Diamondbacks to give the Dodgers a 5–1 victory with one week left in the regular season. The Dodgers went on to win their last seven games of the regular season, qualifying for the postseason. For the season, Garciaparra batted .303 with 20 home runs and 93 RBI, and struck out only 30 times, in 122 games. On October 7, Garciaparra was named the National League&#x27;s Comeback Player of the Year for 2006. He received 72,054 votes. Ultimately, the Dodgers were swept by the New York Mets in the 2006 NLDS. Garciaparra batted only .222 in the series, but did drive in 2 runs. On November 20, 2006, the Dodgers re-signed Garciaparra to a two-year contract worth $18.5 million, keeping him with the team through the 2008 season.

====2007–08====
Garciaparra got off to a strong start in 2007, batting .307 in April, but did not hit for power as he usually did, with only 1 home run during the first two and a half months of the season. On June 25, 2007, Garciaparra volunteered to move from first to third base in order to make room for rookie James Loney. He missed time in August and September due to injury, but still appeared in 121 games. His numbers were down, however, as he batted .283 with just 7 home runs and 59 RBI.

During 2008 spring training Garciaparra suffered a microfracture to his hand after a hit-by-pitch. That forced him to start the 2008 MLB season on the Disabled List. Rookie Blake DeWitt played third base in the meantime. On April 16, he started his first game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, only to suffer a strained left calf muscle nine days later, resulting in another trip to the DL. He returned July 4, playing at shortstop for the first time since 2005 due to an injury to Rafael Furcal. On August 1, Garciaparra was placed on the DL to make room for Manny Ramirez, who had been acquired in a trade. Garciaparra had sprained his knee in a July 27 contest against the Washington Nationals after being slid into spikes-first at third base as Garciaparra had attempted to field a throw and tag the runner, Lastings Milledge.

He returned on August 12, and continued seeing time at shortstop through the end of the month. On August 13, he hit a walk-off home run against the Philadelphia Phillies, giving the Dodgers a 7–6 win. Garciaparra actually saw more time at shortstop during 2008 than any other position to accommodate other players on the Dodgers. But by September, he was back to seeing time at first base and third base, and being used as a pinch hitter. Despite the return to the position he enjoyed the most success in his career, it was a difficult season for Nomar. He hit .264 for the year, with 8 home runs and 28 RBI, as he appeared in only 55 games. The Dodgers met the Phillies in the 2008 NLCS once the postseason started, and Garciaparra hit well, going 3-for-7 (.429) with 1 RBI in the series. However, he did not appear in Game 1, and subsequently did not play the entirety of any game in the series, as he was either used as a substitute, or was replaced as the game went on in Games 2–5. The Dodgers were defeated in the fifth game by the Phillies, who eventually moved on to win the 2008 World Series.

===Oakland Athletics===
====2009====
On March 6, 2009, Garciaparra signed a one-year deal with the Oakland Athletics. With the acquisition of Matt Holliday from the Colorado Rockies in the off-season, Garciaparra was not granted his accustomed number 5, instead wearing number 1. Immediately after Holliday&#x27;s trade to the St. Louis Cardinals, Eric Patterson was called up and given number 5. Garciaparra and Patterson subsequently switched numbers. In his final season, Garciaparra batted .281 with three home runs and 16 RBI in 65 games with Oakland.

====Career statistics====
In 1,434 games over 14 seasons, Garciaparra posted a .313 batting average (1,747-for-5,586) with 927 runs, 370 doubles, 52 triples, 229 home runs, 936 RBI, 95 stolen bases, 403 bases on balls, .361 on-base percentage, and .521 slugging percentage. He finished his career with an overall .975 fielding percentage. In 32 postseason games, he was productive, batting .321 (36-for-112) with seven home runs and 24 RBI.

==Retirement==

On March 10, 2010, Garciaparra signed a one-day contract with the Boston Red Sox to enable him to retire as a member of the Red Sox. Garciaparra took a position at ESPN, contributing analysis for the program &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot; as well as select &quot;Wednesday Night Baseball&quot; telecasts. He has also been one of the lead analysts on ESPN&#x27;s coverage of the College World Series.

On May 5, 2010, the Red Sox hosted &quot;Nomar Garciaparra Night,&quot; honoring Garciaparra before a game against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. He was given two official seats from Fenway by Johnny Pesky, one bearing Garciaparra&#x27;s own number 5, and the other bearing Pesky&#x27;s number 6.

Garciaparra threw out the first pitch on Nomar Day, with his signature off-balance sidearm throw, to his former teammate Jason Varitek.

On December 2, 2013, the Los Angeles Dodgers announced that Garciaparra would be part of their broadcast team beginning with the 2014 season. He served as a pre-and-post game analyst for the Dodgers&#x27; telecasts on SportsNet LA, and also teamed with Rick Monday to call most of the team&#x27;s road games on KLAC and the Dodgers Radio Network. However, a few months into the season he was promoted from the radio broadcasts and added to the television crew, working with Charley Steiner and Orel Hershiser on road games.

On Wednesday, February 5, 2014, it was announced that Garciaparra would be inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame, along with former pitchers Pedro Martínez and Roger Clemens, as well as longtime radio announcer Joe Castiglione.

In a rare non-sports appearance, he had a gag cameo as himself on the October 14, 2000 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The show itself had referenced Garciaparra during 14 sketches called The Boston Teens starring Jimmy Fallon and Rachel Dratch who played a pair of Lexington, Massachusetts teenagers. The duo were avid fans of the Boston Red Sox; in particular their favorite player, who they called: &quot;Nomah&quot; and sported team shirts.

In 2016, he still lived in Whittier with his family, and was doing commentary for local Los Angeles Dodgers broadcasts. By 2020, he and his family were based out of Manhattan Beach in California.

==Personal life==

Garciaparra&#x27;s younger brother, Michael, was selected by the Seattle Mariners in the first round of the 2001 MLB draft and played in Minor League Baseball until 2010.

On November 22, 2003, Garciaparra married Olympian and World Cup Champion soccer star Mia Hamm. The couple has twin girls, Grace Isabella and Ava Caroline, who were born on March 27, 2007, in Los Angeles. The couple also welcomed their first son, named Garrett Anthony, born in January 2012. Hamm and Garciaparra originally met at a 1998 promotional event in Boston, where Hamm defeated Garciaparra in a soccer shootout. Hamm, married at the time, later stated that she was impressed with Garciaparra&#x27;s passion for the game, and the two kept in touch as friends. Sometime after Hamm&#x27;s 2001 divorce, the two began dating.

Garciaparra is known for his elaborate routine between pitches when batting. This includes batting glove adjustments and alternating toe taps on the ground prior to an ensuing pitch.

On October 7, 2005, Garciaparra and his uncle Victor Garciaparra were alerted to the screams of two women who had fallen into Boston Harbor outside his condominium. One of the women sustained injuries to her head after hitting the pier on her way in. Garciaparra quickly jumped into the harbor and saved both women, who were later taken to the hospital.

In November 2014, Garciaparra became a minority investor in Los Angeles F.C. of Major League Soccer (MLS), In 2022, LAFC won the MLS Cup, thus making Garciaparra an MLS champion as part owner.

<text>The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program compiles official data on crime in the United States, published by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). UCR is &quot;a nationwide, cooperative statistical effort of nearly 18,000 city, university and college, county, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement agencies voluntarily reporting data on crimes brought to their attention&quot;.

Crime statistics are compiled from UCR data and published annually by the FBI in the &quot;Crime in the United States&quot; series. The FBI does not collect the data itself. Rather, law enforcement agencies across the United States provide the data to the FBI, which then compiles the Reports.

The Uniform Crime Reporting program began in 1929, and since then has become an important source of crime information for law enforcement, policymakers, scholars, and the media.

==History==

=== Formation by the IACP &amp; SSRC and Initial Reports (1927-1930) ===
The UCR Program was based upon work by the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) and the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) throughout the 1920s to create a uniform national set of crime statistics, reliable for analysis. In 1927, the IACP created the Committee on Uniform Crime Reporting to determine statistics for national comparisons. The committee concluded that eight index crimes were fundamental to comparing crime rates across geographic locations: murder and non-negligent manslaughter, negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft. (From 1930 to 1957, negligent manslaughter was included as an index crime. In 1979, arson would be added as an index crime by a congressional directive.) 

The early program was managed by the IACP and published through a monthly report. The first report in January 1930 reported data from 400 cities throughout 43 states, covering more than 20 million individuals, approximately twenty percent of the total U.S. population at the time.

=== Transition to Oversight by the FBI (1930) ===
The intention of the IACP in developing the UCR program was always to have its management transferred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Through IACP lobbying, on June 11, 1930 the United States Congress passed legislation enacting 28 U.S.C. § 534, which granted the office of the Attorney General the ability to &quot;acquire, collect, classify, and preserve identification, criminal identification, crime, and other records&quot; and the ability to appoint officials to oversee this duty, including the subordinate members of the Bureau of Investigation. The Attorney General, in turn, designated the FBI to serve as the national clearinghouse for the data collected, and the FBI assumed responsibility for managing the UCR Program in September 1930. In the July 1930 issue of the crime report the IACP announced the FBI&#x27;s takeover of the program. While the IACP discontinued oversight of the program, they continued to advise the FBI on how to better the UCR.

Since 1935, the FBI served as a data clearinghouse, organizing, collecting, and disseminating information voluntarily submitted by local, state, federal and tribal law enforcement agencies. The UCR remained the primary tool for collection and analysis of data for the next half century.

=== Development of NIBRS (1980s-present) ===
Throughout the 1980s, a series of National UCR Conferences were with members from the IACP, Department of Justice, including the FBI, and newly formed Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). The purpose was to determine necessary system revisions and then implement them. The result of these conferences was the release of a &quot;Blueprint for the Future of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program&quot; release in May 1985, detailing the necessary revisions. The key recommendations made by the report were 1) a move to requesting data on each individual offense rather than monthly totals, 2) a move to requesting more detailed data about crime incidents including more specific data used to classify offenses and information like the victim and offender&#x27;s demographic characteristics, their relationship, and the location of the crime, and 3) quality assurance measures like routine audits, minimum reporting-system standards, increased feedback to and from local agencies, and strengthening of state-level UCR Programs. 

These recommendations were implemented in the form of the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). The FBI began accepting data in the new NIBRS format in January, 1989. For many years, the FBI collected UCR data in both the NIBRS and traditional Summary Reporting System (SRS) formats. In 2015, in consultation with the their law enforcement partners and the Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Advisory Policy Board, the FBI announced that it would be retiring the SRS format. As of January 1, 2021, the SRS has been discontinued and been fully replaced by (NIBRS).

== Coverage ==
Each month, law enforcement agencies report the number of known index crimes in their jurisdiction to the FBI. This mainly includes crimes reported to the police by the general public, but may also include crimes that police officers discover, and known through other sources. Law enforcement agencies also report the number of crime cases cleared.

In 2003, FBI UCR data were compiled from more than 16,000 agencies, representing 93 percent of the population in 46 states and the District of Columbia. While nationally reporting is not mandated, many states have instituted laws requiring law enforcement within those states to provide UCR data.

== Data Collection and Publications ==
The UCR Program has published data on crime in the United States since 1930. In addition, the UCR Program has published more specific reports based on its primary data collection efforts and overseen other data collection efforts related to crime and law enforcement in the U.S. 

=== Crime in the United States ===

* National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) - NIBRS collects information about offenses known to and arrests made by law enforcement officers in the U.S. While the FBI began collecting NIBRS-format data in 1989, the NIBRS data collection program ran concurrently with the traditional SRS for many years. As of January 1, 2021, NIBRS is the sole FBI data collection program used for crime data. NIBRS-format data is reported at the incident-level rather than in totals per months (as the SRS was). For each incident, agencies are asked to report information about the crime victim(s), the offender(s), their relationship to each other, and the value of any property stolen, lost, damaged, etc. during the incident. 
* Summary Reporting System (SRS) - The SRS collected information about offenses known to and arrests made by law enforcement officers in the U.S. The SRS data collection program was in use from 1930 to 2020. SRS-format data included monthly offense totals for the eight index crimes and arrest totals for all crime types broken down by age, sex, race, and (starting in 2013) Hispanic-origin. 
** Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) - As part of the SRS program, agencies were also asked to submit detailed information about each homicide incident that occurred in their jurisdiction through the SHR. This information included the date, location, and circumstances of the killing, the method used to kill, and demographic characteristics of the homicide victim and the offender. In addition, the Supplementary Homicide Reports included data about incidents of justifiable homicide, that is, non-crime incidents when a private citizen kills someone committing a crime or when law enforcement kills someone while acting in the line of duty. This information is now collected as part of NIBRS. 
* Hate Crime Statistics - As part of the Hate Crime Statistics Act passed in 1990, the UCR began collecting additional information about hate crimes reported through the SRS and NIBRS.
* Cargo Theft
* Federal Crime Data 
* Human Trafficking 

=== Law Enforcement Data Collections ===

* Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted (LEOKA)
* Law Enforcement Suicide Data Collection 
* The National Use-of-Force Data Collection 

==UCR crime categories==

=== NIBRS Categories ===
Under the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), offenses are classified as Group A or Group B offenses. Additionally, Group A offenses can fall into one of three sub-categories: crimes against persons, crimes against property, or crimes against society. 

==== Group A (Offenses &amp; Arrests) ====
Agencies are asked to fill out an incident report for every Group A offense reported to them (or that they otherwise come to know about), regardless of whether an arrest was made. NIBRS&#x27;s Group A therefore replaces and expands on the SRS&#x27;s Part I offenses.

==== Group B (Arrests Only) ====
Agencies only submit information to the FBI about Group B offenses if an arrest is made. 
=== SRS Categories ===
The UCR program&#x27;s traditional Summary Reporting System (SRS) was in use from 1930 to 2020. As of January 1, 2021, the SRS has been discontinued and been fully replaced by the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). In the SRS, criminal offenses were divided into two major groups: Part I offenses and Part II offenses.

==== Part I Offenses (Offenses &amp; Arrests) ====
In Part I, the UCR indexed reported incidents of major crimes, referred to as &quot;index crimes,&quot; which were reported to the FBI via a document named &quot;Return A – Monthly Return of Offenses Known to the Police.&quot; Agencies were asked to report each month the total number of index crimes reported to them (or that they otherwise came to know about) regardless of whether an arrest was made.

Crimes were included in the index based on their relative seriousness, their tendency to be reported more reliably than other crime types, and that reports for them are generally taken directly by the police and not a separate agency which aggregates the data and does not necessarily contribute to the UCR. The index crimes were broken into two categories: violent and property crimes. Murder and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault were classified as violent crimes and used to create an overall &quot;violent crime index&quot; while burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson were classified as property crimes and used to create an overall &quot;property crime index.&quot; 

Arson was not initially included as one of the Part I index crimes. It was added in 1979 by a congressional directive.

From 1930 to 1957, negligent manslaughter was included in UCR reporting as one of the violent index crimes. As of 1958 annual report, it was no longer included in reporting about the index crimes, although the FBI continued to request information about the total number of negligent homicide offenses known to law enforcement agencies as part of Return A until 1985. So, from 1958 to 1985, negligent manslaughter was a Part I offense but not an index crime. 

==== Part II Offenses (Arrests Only) ====
In Part II, the following categories were tracked: simple assault, curfew offenses and loitering, embezzlement, forgery and counterfeiting, disorderly conduct, driving under the influence, drug offenses, fraud, gambling, liquor offenses, offenses against the family, prostitution, public drunkenness, runaways, sex offenses, stolen property, vandalism, vagrancy, and weapons offenses. Agencies were asked to report each month the total number of arrests made for all Part I and Part II offenses.

==Advisory groups==
The Criminal Justice Information Systems Committees of the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) and the National Sheriffs&#x27; Association (NSA) serve in an advisory capacity to the UCR Program and encourage local police departments and sheriff&#x27;s departments to participate fully in the program.

In 1988, a Data Providers&#x27; Advisory Policy Board was established to provide input for UCR matters. The Board operated until 1993 when it combined with the National Crime Information Center Advisory Policy Board to form a single Advisory Policy Board (APB) to address all issues regarding the FBI&#x27;s criminal justice information services. In addition, the Association of State UCR Programs (ASUCRP) focuses on UCR issues within individual state law enforcement associations and promotes interest in the UCR Program. These organizations foster widespread and responsible use of UCR statistics and assist data contributors when needed.

==Limitations==
The UCR itself warns that it reflects crime reports by police, not later adjudication. Because reporting quality, arrest likelihood, officers per capita, and funding vary by jurisdiction, the data should not be used to compare crime rates or frequencies between reporting agencies.

<doc id="213936" wikidata="Q234570" url="?curid=213936" title="Harriet Martineau">
<text>Harriet Martineau (12 June 1802 – 27 June 1876) was an English social theorist. She wrote from a sociological, holistic, religious and feminine angle, translated works by Auguste Comte, and, rare for a woman writer at the time, earned enough to support herself. The young Princess Victoria enjoyed her work and invited her to her 1838 coronation. Martineau advised &quot;a focus on all [society&#x27;s] aspects, including key political, religious, and social institutions&quot;. She applied thorough analysis to women&#x27;s status under men. The novelist Margaret Oliphant called her &quot;a born lecturer and politician... less distinctively affected by her sex than perhaps any other, male or female, of her generation.&quot;

Her lifelong commitment to the abolitionist movement has seen Martineau&#x27;s celebrity and achievements studied world-wide, particularly at American institutions of higher education such as Northwestern University. When unveiling a statue of Martineau in December 1883 at the Old South Meeting House in Boston, Wendell Phillips referred to her as the &quot;greatest American abolitionist&quot;. Martineau&#x27;s statue was donated to Wellesley College in 1886.

==Early life==

Born in Norwich, England, Harriet Martineau was the sixth of the eight children of Thomas, a textile manufacturer. He served as deacon of the Octagon Chapel, Norwich from 1797. Her mother, Elizabeth (née Rankin), was the daughter of a sugar refiner and grocer. Harriet&#x27;s five older siblings included two sisters and three brothers. In age order their names were, Elizabeth, Thomas, Henry, Robert and Rachel Ann. Harriet&#x27;s two younger siblings were James and the youngest of the eight, Ellen.

The Martineau family was of French Huguenot ancestry and professed Unitarian views. Her uncles included the surgeon Philip Meadows Martineau (1752–1829), whom she had enjoyed visiting at his nearby estate, Bracondale Lodge, and businessman and benefactor Peter Finch Martineau. Martineau was closest to her brother James, who became a philosopher and clergyman in the tradition of the English Dissenters. According to the writer Diana Postlethwaite, Harriet&#x27;s relationship with her mother was strained and lacking affection, which contributed to views expressed in her later writing. Martineau claimed her mother abandoned her to a wet nurse.

Harriet&#x27;s childhood was rather different compared to any other ordinary child. Her family was financially comfortable and they were close friends with the Gurney family of Earlham Hall, Norfolk. Harriet&#x27;s father, Thomas, owned the leasehold of the Gurney&#x27;s home, Gurney Court, Harriet&#x27;s birthplace. The family&#x27;s wealth remained intact until around 1825–26 when the stock market and banking system collapsed. As previously mentioned Harriet and her mother&#x27;s relationship was quite hostile early on. It was a traditional gesture for mothers to hire wet nurses for their children, especially if they could not nurse their child by themselves. However the specific wet nurse that Harriet&#x27;s mother had hired could not produce a sufficient amount of milk for an infant. This left Harriet starved for the first few weeks of her life, which is what Mrs. Martineau had attributed all of Harriet&#x27;s future ailments to.

Harriet&#x27;s ideas on domesticity and the &quot;natural faculty for housewifery&quot;, as described in her book &quot;Household Education&quot; (1848), stemmed from her lack of nurture growing up. It was found that affection shown toward Harriet by her mother was quite rare. In fact, there have been findings that suggested that Harriet had imagined angels coming to take her away, which was thought to symbolize her wishing to find a way to escape her mother&#x27;s reign through suicide.

Although their relationship was better in adulthood, Harriet saw her mother as the antithesis of the warm and nurturing qualities which she knew to be necessary for girls at an early age. Her mother urged all her children to be well read, but at the same time opposed female pedantics &quot;with a sharp eye for feminine propriety and good manners. Her daughters could never be seen in public with a pen in their hand&quot;. Despite this conservative approach to raising girls, Harriet was not the only academically successful daughter in the family; her sister Rachel ran her own Unitarian academy with artist Hilary Bonham Carter as one of her students. Mrs. Martineau strictly enforced proper feminine behavior, pushing her daughter to &quot;hold a sewing needle&quot; as well as the (hidden) pen.

== Education ==
In the Martineau family, Harriet&#x27;s mother Elizabeth made sure all her children received a proper education. With the Martineaus being Unitarian, both the boys and girls in the family were expected to receive a conventional education. In order to abide by this well-rounded education, Harriet was taught at home by several of her elder siblings in the beginning of her education journey. Harriet was taught French by her mother, which was the predominant language spoken by her father. Thomas, her father, taught her Latin, and her brother Thomas taught Harriet maths and writing. Unfortunately for Harriet, being taught at home especially by all her siblings often led to lots of mockery.

When she was nine years old Harriet transitioned to a small school run by a man named Mr. Perry. Mr. Perry was very special to Harriet, allegedly one of the first people in her life to provide her with a positive and non-judgmental learning environment. Later on in her life, Harriet claimed that Mr. Perry&#x27;s school was the catalyst for her intellectual development and interest in education. As her education progressed she began to grow very fond of the following topics: Shakespeare, political economy, philosophy and history. Despite her love for all these topics, her mind was often dominated by the three biggest insecurities in her life: her hearing disability, her poor handwriting, and the look of her hair.

The next step in Harriet Martineau&#x27;s education came when she received an invitation from the all-girl boarding school that her Aunt and Uncle Kentish ran in Bristol. Besides the standardized course she took at the school, Harriet began her lifelong self-directed research here. She dived deep into topics on her own, such as Latin, Greek, Italian, and even took a deeper interest in the Bible. Up until her brother James, who was born when she was 3 years old, went off to college at the Manchester New College of York in 1821 (Harris Manchester College, Oxford), she did not write often. James and Harriet had a great relationship, so James had suggested that Harriet begin writing as a way to cope with their new separation.

== Writing career ==

Martineau began losing her senses of taste and smell at a young age. She was deaf and having to use an ear trumpet at the young age of 12. However, it was said that Harriet did not actually utilize the ear trumpet until her late twenties as she was trying to avoid harassment from others by doing so. It was the beginning of many health problems in her life. With such an early onset of illness, and the passing of her father, requiring her to make a living for herself, she became an avid writer. In 1821, she began to write anonymously for the &quot;Monthly Repository&quot;, a Unitarian periodical. Her first contribution was &quot;Female Writers of Practical Divinity,&quot; and in 1823 she published &quot;Devotional Exercises and Addresses, Prayers and Hymns&quot;.

The year 1823 was the same year that Harriet&#x27;s brother James introduced her to one of his friends from school, John Hugh Worthington. The two were engaged, however never married as Worthington fell ill and died. Martineau later reveals in her autobiography that she was in a strange sense relieved in the long run that marriage was not an option, as their relationship was filled with stress and disagreements. Martineau remained unmarried in her life.

Her earliest novels were also published during these years, beginning with &quot;Principle and Practice&quot; in 1827 and &quot;&quot; in 1829.

In 1829, the family&#x27;s textile business failed. Martineau, then 27 years old, stepped out of the traditional roles of feminine propriety to earn a living for her family. Along with her needlework, she began selling her articles to the &quot;Monthly Repository&quot;, earning accolades, including three essay prizes from the Unitarian Association. Her regular work with the &quot;Repository&quot; helped establish her as a reliable and popular freelance writer.

In Martineau&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography&quot;, she reflects on her success as a writer and her father&#x27;s business failure, which she describes as &quot;one of the best things that ever happened to us&quot;. She described how she could then &quot;truly live instead of vegetate&quot;. Her reflection emphasizes her experience with financial responsibility in her life while she writes &quot;[her] fusion of literary and economic narratives&quot;.

Harriet&#x27;s first commissioned book, &quot;Illustrations of Political Economy&quot;, was a fictional tutorial intended to help the general public understand the ideas of Adam Smith. &quot;Illustrations&quot; was published in February 1832 in an edition of just 1500 copies, since the publisher assumed it would not sell well. Yet it very quickly became highly successful, and would steadily out-sell the work of Charles Dickens. &quot;Illustrations&quot; was her first work to receive widespread acclaim, and its success served to spread the free-market ideas of Adam Smith and others throughout the British Empire. Martineau then agreed to compose a series of similar monthly stories over a period of two years, the work being hastened by having her brother James also work on the series with her.

The subsequent works offered fictional tutorials on a range of political economists such as James Mill, Bentham and Ricardo, the latter especially forming her view of rent law. Martineau relied on Malthus to form her view of the tendency of human population to exceed its means of subsistence. However, in stories such as &quot;Weal and Woe in Garvelock&quot;, she promoted the idea of population control through what Malthus referred to as &quot;voluntary checks&quot; such as voluntary chastity and delayed marriages.

One of Martineau&#x27;s most popular works of fiction was &quot;Deerbrook&quot; (1839). The book drew much attention because it focused on the idea of domestic realism. Martineau&#x27;s ideas in the novel were inspired by the works of David Hartley. This novel in particular was different from her other works as her development was evident. Her development included both her improvement of fictional writing, but also showed mastery of the theories she wrote about.

==London and the United States==
In the early 19th century, most social institutions and norms were strongly shaped by gender, or the perception of what was appropriate for men versus for women. Writing was no exception; non-fiction works about social, economic and political issues were dominated by men, while limited areas, such as romance fiction, and topics dealing with domesticity were considered to be appropriate for women authors. Despite these gendered expectations in the literary world, Martineau strongly expressed her opinions on a variety of topics.

Martineau&#x27;s frequent publication in the Repository acquainted her with editor Rev. William Johnson Fox (not William Darwin Fox, see disambiguation). First coming to London around 1830, Martineau joined Fox&#x27;s social circle of prominent thinkers, which also introduced her to Erasmus Alvey Darwin, older brother to Charles Darwin.

In November 1832, Martineau moved to London. Among her acquaintances were: Henry Hallam, Harriet Taylor, Alexander Maconochie, Henry Hart Milman, Thomas Malthus, Monckton Milnes, Sydney Smith, John Stuart Mill, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Sarah Austin, and Charles Lyell, as well as Jane Welsh Carlyle and Thomas Carlyle. She met Florence Nightingale, Charlotte Brontë, George Eliot and Charles Dickens later on in her literary career.

Until 1834, Martineau was occupied with her brother James on the political economy series, as well as a supplemental series of &quot;Poor Laws and Paupers Illustrated and Illustrations of Taxation&quot; which was intended to directly influence government policy. About the same time, she published four stories expressing support of the Whig Poor Law reforms. These tales (direct, lucid, written without any appearance of effort, and yet practically effective) display the characteristics of their author&#x27;s style. Tory paternalists reacted by calling her a Malthusian &quot;who deprecates charity and provision for the poor&quot;, while Radicals opposed her to the same degree. Whig high society fêted her.

In May 1834 Charles Darwin, on his expedition to the Galapagos Islands, received a letter from his sisters saying that Martineau was &quot;now a great Lion in London, much patronized by Ld. Brougham who has set her to write stories on the poor Laws&quot; and recommending &quot;Poor Laws and Paupers Illustrated&quot; in pamphlet-sized parts. They added that their brother Erasmus &quot;knows her &amp; is a very great admirer &amp; every body reads her little books &amp; if you have a dull hour you can, and then throw them overboard, that they may not take up your precious room&quot;.

===Abolitionist===
In 1834–36, after completing the economic series, Harriet Martineau paid a long visit to the United States; she and her travelling companions spanning the nation from New York to Boston, and from Chicago through to Atlanta and elsewhere in Georgia. During this time, she visited a great many people, some little known, others as famous as James Madison, the former US president, at his home at Montpelier. She also met numerous abolitionists in Boston and studied the emerging schools for the education of girls. Her support of abolitionism, then widely unpopular across the U.S., caused controversy, which her publication, soon after her return, of &quot;Society in America&quot; (1837) and &quot;How to Observe Morals and Manners&quot; (1838), only fueled. 
In &quot;Society in America&quot;, Martineau angrily criticized the state of women&#x27;s education. She wrote:

The publication of Martineau&#x27;s &quot;Illustrations of Political Economy&quot; found public success. So much success that, &quot;by 1834, the monthly sales . . . had reached 10,000 in a decade in which a sale of 2,000 or 3,000 copies of a work of fiction was considered highly successful.&quot;

Her article &quot;The Martyr Age of the United States&quot; (1839), in the &quot;Westminster Review&quot;, introduced English readers to the struggles of the abolitionists in America several years after Britain had abolished slavery.

In October 1836, soon after returning from the voyage of the &quot;Beagle&quot;, Charles Darwin went to London to stay with his brother Erasmus. He found him spending his days &quot;driving out Miss Martineau&quot;, who had returned from her trip to the United States. Charles wrote to his sister: 
The Darwins shared Martineau&#x27;s Unitarian background and Whig politics, but their father Robert was concerned that, as a potential daughter-in-law, she was too extreme in her politics. Charles noted that his father was upset by a piece in the &quot;Westminster Review&quot; calling for the radicals to break with the Whigs and give working men the vote &quot;before he knew it was not [Martineau&#x27;s], and wasted a good deal of indignation, and even now can hardly believe it is not hers&quot;. In early December 1836 Charles Darwin called on Martineau and may have discussed the social and natural worlds she was writing about in her book &quot;Society in America&quot;, including the &quot;grandeur and beauty&quot; of the &quot;process of world making&quot; she had seen at Niagara Falls. He remarked in a letter, Significantly, Martineau&#x27;s earlier popularization of Thomas Malthus&#x27; theories of population control may have helped convince Charles to read Malthus, which provided the breakthrough ideas for his nascent theory of evolution.

In April 1838, Charles wrote to his older sister Susan that

Martineau wrote &quot;Deerbrook&quot; (1838), a three-volume novel published after her American books. She portrayed a failed love affair between a physician and his sister-in-law. It was considered her most successful novel. She also wrote &quot;The Hour and the Man: An Historical Romance&quot; (1841), a three-volume novel about the Haitian slave leader Toussaint L&#x27;Ouverture, who contributed to the island nation&#x27;s gaining independence in 1804.

==Newcastle and Tynemouth==

In 1839, during a visit to Continental Europe, Martineau was diagnosed with a uterine tumor. She several times visited her brother-in-law, Thomas Michael Greenhow, who was a celebrated doctor in Newcastle upon Tyne, to try to alleviate her symptoms. On the last occasion she stayed for six months in the Greenhow family house at 28 Eldon Square. Immobile and confined to a couch, she was cared for by her mother until purchasing a house and hiring a nurse to aid her.

She next moved downriver to Tynemouth where she regained her health. She stayed at Mrs Halliday&#x27;s boarding-house, 57 Front Street, for nearly five years from 16 March 1840. The establishment is still open as a guest house today, now named the &quot;Martineau Guest House&quot; in her honor.

The critic Diana Postlethwaite wrote of this period for Martineau: Her illness caused her to literally enact the social constraints of women during this time.

Martineau wrote a number of books during her illness, and a historical plaque marks this house. In 1841 she published a series of four novels for children, &quot;The Playfellow&quot;, comprising &quot;The Settlers at Home&quot;, &quot;The Peasant and the Prince&quot;, &quot;Feats on the Fiord&quot;, and &quot;The Crofton Boys&quot;. In 1844 she published &quot;Life in the Sickroom: Essays by an Invalid,&quot; an autobiographical reflection on invalidism. She wrote &quot;Household Education&quot; (1848), the handbook on the &quot;proper&quot; way to raise and educate children. Lastly, she began working on her autobiography. Completed much later, it included some hundred pages on this period. Notable visitors included Richard Cobden and Thomas and Jane Carlyle.

&quot;Life in the Sickroom&quot; is considered to be one of Martineau&#x27;s finest works. It upset evangelical readers, as they &quot;thought it dangerous in &#x27;its supposition of self-reliance&#x27;&quot;. This series of essays embraced traditional womanhood. Martineau dedicated it to Elizabeth Barrett, as it was &quot;an outpouring of feeling to an idealized female alter ego, both professional writer and professional invalid- and utterly unlike the women in her own family&quot;. Written during a kind of public break from her mother, this book was Martineau&#x27;s proclamation of independence.

At the same time, Martineau turned the traditional patient–doctor relationship on its head by asserting control over her space even in sickness. The sickroom was her space. &quot;Life in the Sickroom&quot; explained how to regain control even in illness. Alarmed that a woman was suggesting such a position in the power dynamic, critics suggested that, as she was an invalid, her mind must also be sick and the work was not to be taken seriously. &quot;British and Foreign Medical Review&quot; dismissed Martineau&#x27;s piece on the same basis as the critics: an ill person cannot write a healthy work. They thought it was unheard of for a woman to suggest being in a position of control, especially in sickness. Instead, the &quot;Review&quot; recommended that patients follow &quot;unconditional submission&quot; to the advice of doctors. They disagreed with the idea that Martineau might hold any sort of &quot;authority to Britain&#x27;s invalids&quot;.

Expecting to remain an invalid for the rest of her life, Martineau delighted in the new freedom of views using her telescope. Across the Tyne was the sandy beach &quot;where there are frequent wrecks — too interesting to an invalid... and above the rocks, a spreading heath, where I watch troops of boys flying their kites; lovers and friends taking their breezy walks on Sundays...&quot; She expressed a lyrical view of Tynemouth:
During her illness, she for a second time declined a pension on the civil list, fearing to compromise her political independence. After publication of her letter on the subject, some of her friends raised a small annuity for her soon after.

In 1844, Martineau underwent a course of mesmerism, returning to health after a few months. There was national interest in mesmerism at this time. Also known as &quot;animal magnetism&quot;, it can be defined as a &quot;loosely grouped set of practices in which one person influenced another through a variety of personal actions, or through the direct influence of one mind on another mind. Mesmerism was designed to make invisible forces augment the mental powers of the mesmeric object.&quot; Martineau eventually published an account of her case in 16 &quot;Letters on Mesmerism&quot;, which caused much discussion. Her work led to friction with &quot;the natural prejudices of a surgeon and a surgeon&#x27;s wife&quot; (i.e., her brother-in-law, Thomas Michael Greenhow and her sister, Elizabeth Martineau Greenhow).

==Ambleside==
In 1845, Martineau left Tynemouth for Ambleside in the Lake District, where she designed herself and oversaw the construction of the house called &quot;The Knoll, Ambleside&quot; (made a Grade II Listed Building in 1974), where she spent the greater part of her later life. Although she was single and had no children she believed that: She began house-hunting and the first house she looked at was not entirely perfect and did not have everything that she needed and was looking for. Her friend, who went with her to view it, said it would be worth the money to build a house of her own rather than pay for something she did not love. The next place Martineau was brought to look at was the land of a minister at Ambleside called the Knoll. She ended up getting a great deal for the original plot of land and a bonus plot. The next task she took on was actually planning the layout of the house, which found very enjoyable. When the actual act of constructing came around, she and her contractor were on very good terms and understood each other&#x27;s expectations, in terms of payment and time commitments. It was not until April 1846 that Martineau moved into her new house, which was later referred to as The Knoll at Ambleside in England.

== Views on religion, philosophical atheism, and Darwin ==
In 1845, Martineau published three volumes of &quot;Forest and Game Law Tales&quot;. In 1846, she resided with her elderly mother, Elizabeth, in Birmingham for some time, following which she then toured Egypt, Palestine and Syria with some friends. On her return she published &quot;Eastern Life, Present and Past&quot; (1848), in which she reports a breakthrough realization standing on a prominence looking out across the Nile and desert to the tombs of the dead, where &quot;the deceased crossed the living valley and river&quot; to &quot;the caves of the death region&quot; where Osiris the supreme judge &quot;is to give the sign of acceptance or condemnation&quot;. Her summary: &quot;the mortuary ideas of the primitive Egyptians, and through them, of the civilized world at large, have been originated by the everlasting conflict of the Nile and the Desert&quot;.

This epiphany changed the course of her life. &quot;Eastern Life&quot; expressed her concept that, as humanity passed through one after another of the world&#x27;s historic religions, the conception of the deity and of divine government became at each step more and more abstract and indefinite. She believed the ultimate goal to be philosophic atheism, but did not explicitly say so in the book. She described ancient tombs, &quot;the black pall of oblivion&quot; set against the paschal &quot;puppet show&quot; in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and noted that Christian beliefs in reward and punishment were based on and similar to heathen superstitions. Describing an ancient Egyptian tomb, she wrote, &quot;How like ours were his life and death!... Compare him with a retired naval officer made country gentleman in our day, and in how much less do they differ than agree!&quot; The book&#x27;s &quot;infidel tendency&quot; was too much for the publisher John Murray, who rejected it. Martineau&#x27;s biographer, Florence Fenwick Miller, wrote that &quot;all her best moral and intellectual faculties were exerted, and their action becomes visible, at one page or another&quot; of this work. &quot;Eastern Life, Present and Past&quot; marked an important chapter in Martineau&#x27;s life as it documented her move away from Unitarianism towards atheism, which was never fully achieved. This shifting of religiosity can best be seen in her instruction to travel with the hopes of gaining a historical understanding of holy places and in her critiques on biblical literalism, as influenced by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. &quot;Eastern Life, Present and Past&quot; is also important historically, as Billie Melman notes, it was the &quot;first feminine travelogue proper that is not an account of a pilgrimage.&quot; In her doing so, Martineau&#x27;s so-called &quot;anti-pilgrimage&quot; became an important point in the growth of female academia, as well as an addition to the growing field of Egyptology.

Martineau wrote &quot;Household Education&quot; in 1848, lamenting the state of women&#x27;s education. She believed women had a natural inclination to motherhood and believed domestic work went hand in hand with academia for a proper, well-rounded education. She stated, &quot;I go further than most persons... in desiring thorough practice in domestic occupations, from an early age, for young girls&quot;. She proposed that freedom and rationality, rather than command and obedience, are the most effectual instruments of education.

Her interest in schemes of instruction led her to start a series of lectures, addressed at first to the school children of Ambleside, but afterward extended to their parents at the request of the adults. The subjects were sanitary principles and practice, the histories of England and North America, and the scenes of her Eastern travels. At the request of the publisher Charles Knight, in 1849 she wrote &quot;The History of the Thirty Years&#x27; Peace, 1816–1846&quot;, an excellent popular history from the point of view of a &quot;philosophical Radical&quot;. Martineau spanned a wide variety of subject matter in her writing and did so with more assertiveness than was expected of women at the time. She has been described as having an &quot;essentially masculine nature&quot;. It was commonly thought that a &quot;progressive&quot; woman, in being progressive, was improperly emulating the qualities of a man.

Martineau&#x27;s work included a widely used guide book to the Lake District, &quot;A Complete Guide to the English Lakes&quot;, published in 1855 and in its 4th edition by 1876. This served as the definitive guidebook for the area for 25 years, effectively replacing the earlier guide by William Wordsworth, and continued in common usage until the publication of Baddeley&#x27;s &quot;Thorough Guide to the English Lake District&quot; in 1880.
Martineau edited a volume of &quot;Letters on the Laws of Man&#x27;s Nature and Development&quot;, published in March 1851. Its epistolary form is based on correspondence between her and the self-styled scientist Henry G. Atkinson. She expounded the doctrine of philosophical atheism, which she thought the tendency of human belief. She did not deny a first cause but declared it unknowable. She and Atkinson thought they affirmed man&#x27;s moral obligation. Atkinson was a zealous exponent of mesmerism. The prominence given to the topics of mesmerism and clairvoyance heightened the general disapproval of the book. Literary London was outraged by its mesmeric evolutionary atheism, and the book caused a lasting division between Martineau, her beloved brother, James who had become a Unitarian cleric, and some of her friends.

From 1852 to 1866, she contributed regularly to the &quot;Daily News&quot;, writing sometimes six leaders a week. She wrote more than 1,600 articles for the paper in total. It also published her &quot;Letters from Ireland&quot;, written during a visit to that country in the summer of 1852. For many years she was a contributor to the &quot;Westminster Review&quot;; in 1854 she was among financial supporters who prevented its closing down.

Martineau believed she had experienced psychosomatic symptoms and later benefits from mesmerism; this medical belief of the times related the uterus to emotions and hysteria. She had symptoms of hysteria in her loss of taste and smell. Her partial deafness throughout life may have contributed to her problems. Various people, including the maid, her brother, and Spencer T. Hall (a notable mesmerist) performed mesmerism on her. Some historians attribute her apparent recovery from symptoms to a shift in the positioning of her tumor so that it no longer obstructed other organs. As the physical improvements were the first signs of healing she had in five years and happened at the same time of her first mesmeric treatment, Martineau confidentially credited mesmerism with her &quot;cure&quot;.

She continued her political activism during the late 1850s and 1860s. She supported the Married Women&#x27;s Property Bill and in 1856 signed a petition for it organized by Barbara Bodichon. She also pushed for licensed prostitution and laws that addressed the customers rather than the women. She supported women&#x27;s suffrage and signed Bodichon&#x27;s petition in its favor in 1866.

In the early part of 1855, Martineau was experiencing heart disease. She began to write her autobiography, as she expected her life to end. Completing the book rapidly in three months, she postponed its publication until after her death, and lived another two decades. It was published posthumously in 1877.

When Darwin&#x27;s book &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; was published in 1859, his brother Erasmus sent a copy to his old flame Harriet Martineau. At age 58, she was still reviewing from her home in the Lake District. From her &quot;snow landscape&quot;, Martineau sent her thanks, adding that she had previously praised
Martineau supported Darwin&#x27;s theory because it was not based in theology. Martineau strove for secularism stating, &quot;In the present state of the religious world, Secularism ought to flourish. What an amount of sin and woe might and would then be extinguished.&quot; She wrote to her fellow Malthusian (and atheist) George Holyoake enthusing, &quot;What a book it is! – overthrowing (if true) revealed Religion on the one hand, &amp; Natural (as far as Final Causes &amp; Design are concerned) on the other. The range &amp; mass of knowledge take away one&#x27;s breath.&quot; To Fanny Wedgwood (the wife of Hensleigh Wedgwood) she wrote,
==Economics and social sciences==
Harriet Martineau propounds political economic theories in &quot;Illustrations of Political Economy&quot;. She is seen as a frontrunner who merges fiction and economy in a time period when &quot;fiction claimed authority over emotional knowledge, while economics claimed authority over empirical knowledge&quot;. Moreover, Martineau&#x27;s text sets the stage for women to enter into economics. For example, Lana Dalley explains that &quot;by bringing the topic of domestic economy to bear on political economy, Martineau places women more centrally within economic theory and practice. In this context, women – as readers of the &quot;Illustrations&quot; and as characters with the tales – are not only rendered a part of larger-scale economics but also (because of their participation) encourage to learn the principles of political economy.&quot;

As early as 1831, Martineau wrote on the subject &quot;Political Economy&quot; (as the field of economics was then known). Her goal was to popularize and illustrate the principles of &quot;laissez faire&quot; capitalism, though she made no claim to original theorizing.

Martineau&#x27;s reflections on &quot;Society in America&quot;, published in 1837, are prime examples of her sociological methods. Her ideas in this field were set out in her 1838 book &quot;How to Observe Morals and Manners&quot;. She believed that some very general social laws influence the life of any society, including the principle of progress, the emergence of science as the most advanced product of human intellectual endeavor, and the significance of population dynamics and the natural physical environment.

Auguste Comte coined the name sociology and published a lengthy exposition under the title of &quot;Cours de Philosophie Positive&quot; in 1839. Martineau undertook a concise translation that was published in two volumes in 1853 as &quot;The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte (freely translated and condensed by Harriet Martineau)&quot;. It was a remarkable achievement, and a successful one; Comte recommended her volumes to his students instead of his own. Some writers regard Martineau as the first female sociologist. Her introduction of Comte to the English-speaking world and the elements of sociological perspective in her original writings support her credit as a sociologist.

==Death==
Harriet Martineau died of bronchitis at &quot;The Knoll&quot; on 27 June 1876, aged 74. An autopsy revealed an ovarian cyst that had grown to twelve inches in diameter. She was buried alongside her mother in Key Hill Cemetery, Hockley, Birmingham. The following April, at Bracondale, her cousin&#x27;s estate, much of Martineau&#x27;s extensive art collection was sold at auction.

Harriet had a unique view on death, she said, &quot;...I have not acquired any dread or dislike of death; but I have felt, for the first, time a keen and unvarying relish of life.&quot; (Harriet 483). She explained how that, as she knew death was approaching, day by day she was not scared of it or dreading it, in fact she even described how she did not let this knowledge impact her daily life activities.

==Legacy==

She left an autobiographical sketch to be published by the &quot;Daily News&quot;, in which she wrote:
In 1877 her autobiography was published. It was rare for a woman to publish such a work, let alone one secular in nature. Her book was regarded as dispassionate, &quot;philosophic to the core&quot; in its perceived masculinity, and a work of necessitarianism. She deeply explored childhood experiences and memories, expressing feelings of having been deprived of her mother&#x27;s affection, as well as strong devotion to her brother James Martineau, a theologian.

The first volume of &quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot;, published in 1881, states: &quot;THESE VOLUMES ARE AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED TO THE Memory of Mary Wollstonecraft, Frances Wright, Lucretia Mott, Harriet Martineau, Lydia Maria Child, Margaret Fuller, Sarah and Angelina Grimké, Josephine S. Griffing, Martha C. Wright, Harriot K. Hunt, M.D., Mariana W. Johnson, Alice and Phebe Carey, Ann Preston, M.D., Lydia Mott, Eliza W. Farnham, Lydia F. Fowler, M.D., Paulina Wright Davis, Whose Earnest Lives and Fearless Words, in Demanding Political Rights for Women, have been, in the Preparation of these Pages, a Constant Inspiration TO The Editors.&quot;.

Martineau&#x27;s name is listed on the east face of the Reformers&#x27; Memorial in Kensal Green cemetery in London.

In February 2014, it was reported that London&#x27;s National Portrait Gallery held several portraits of Martineau.

Anthony Giddens and Simon Griffiths argued that Martineau is a neglected founder of sociology and that she remains important today. She taught that study of the society must include all its aspects, including key political, religious and social institutions, and she insisted on the need to include the lives of women. She was the first sociologist to study such issues as marriage, children, religious life, and race relations. Finally, she called on sociologists to do more than just observe, but also work to benefit the society.

<doc id="213940" wikidata="Q1342455" url="?curid=213940" title="Myxomatosis">
<text>Myxomatosis is a disease caused by &quot;Myxoma virus&quot;, a poxvirus in the genus &quot;Leporipoxvirus&quot;. The natural hosts are tapeti (&quot;Sylvilagus brasiliensis&quot;) in South and Central America, and brush rabbits (&quot;Sylvilagus bachmani&quot;) in North America. The myxoma virus causes only a mild disease in these species, but causes a severe and usually fatal disease in European rabbits (&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot;), the species of rabbit commonly raised for companionship and as a food source.

Myxomatosis is an example of what occurs when a virus jumps from a species adapted to the virus to a naive host, and has been extensively studied for this reason. The virus was intentionally introduced in Australia, France, and Chile in the 1950s to control wild European rabbit populations.

==Cause==

&quot;Myxoma virus&quot; is in the genus &quot;Leporipoxvirus&quot; (family &quot;Poxviridae&quot;; subfamily &quot;Chordopoxvirinae&quot;). Like other poxviruses, myxoma viruses are large DNA viruses with linear double-stranded DNA. Virus replication occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell. The natural hosts are tapeti (&quot;Sylvilagus brasiliensis&quot;) in South and Central America, and brush rabbits (&quot;Sylvilagus bachmani&quot;) in North America. The myxoma virus causes only a mild disease in these species, with signs limited to the formation of skin nodules.

Myxomatosis is the name of the severe and often fatal disease in European rabbits caused by the myxoma virus. Different strains exist which vary in their virulence. The Californian strain, which is endemic to the west coast of the United States and Baja in Mexico, is the most virulent, with reported case fatality rates approaching 100%. The South American strain, present in South America and Central America, is slightly less virulent, with reported case fatality rates of 99.8%. Strains present in Europe and Australia were originally introduced from South America but have become attenuated, with reported case fatality rates of 50–95%. While wild rabbits in Europe and Australia have developed some immunity to the virus, this is not generally true of pet rabbits.

==Transmission==
Myxomatosis is transmitted primarily by insects. The myxoma virus does not replicate in these arthropod hosts, but is physically carried by biting arthropods from one rabbit to another. In North America mosquitoes are the primary mode of viral transmission, and multiple species of mosquito can carry the virus. In Europe the rabbit flea is the primary means of transmission. Transmission via the bites of flies, lice, and mites have also been documented. Outbreaks have a seasonal nature and are most likely to occur between August and November, but cases can occur year round. Seasonality is driven by the availability of arthropod vectors and the proximity of infected wild rabbits.

The myxoma virus can also be transmitted by direct contact. Infected rabbits shed the virus in ocular and nasal secretions and from areas of eroded skin. The virus may also be present in semen and genital secretions. Poxviruses are fairly stable in the environment and can be spread by contaminated objects such as water bottles, feeders, caging, or people&#x27;s hands. They are resistant to drying but are sensitive to some disinfectants.

==Pathophysiology==
A laboratory study in which European rabbits received intradermal injections of a South American strain of the myxoma virus demonstrated the following progression of disease. Initially the virus multiplied in the skin at the site of inoculation. Approximately two days following inoculation the virus was found in nearby lymph nodes, and at three days it was found in the bloodstream and abdominal organs. At approximately four days the virus was isolated from non-inoculated skin as well as from the testes. Slight thickening of the eyelids and the presence of virus in conjunctival fluid was detectable on day five. Testicular engorgement was noticed on day six.

== Clinical presentation: South American strains of myxomatosis ==
The clinical signs of myxomatosis depend on the strain of virus, the route of inoculation, and the immune status of the host. Signs of the classic nodular form of the disease include a subcutaneous mass at the site of inoculation, swelling and edema of the eyelids and genitals, a milky or purulent ocular discharge, fever, lethargy, depression, and anorexia.

According to Meredith (2013), the typical time course of the disease is as follows:

In peracute disease with a highly virulent strain, death may occur within 5 to 6 days of infection with minimal clinical signs other than the conjunctivitis. Death usually occurs between days 10 and 12.

In rabbits infected with attenuated, less virulent strains of the virus, the lesions seen are more variable and generally milder, and the time course is delayed and prolonged. Many rabbits will survive and the cutaneous lesions gradually scab and fall off, leaving scarring. A milder form of the disease is also seen in previously vaccinated domestic rabbits that have partial immunity. Vaccinated rabbits often present with localized scabbed lesions, frequently on the bridge of the nose and around the eyes, or multiple cutaneous masses over the body. They are often still bright and alert, and survive with nursing care.

Respiratory signs are a common finding in rabbits that survive the first stages of myxomatosis. Mucopurulent nasal discharge occurs, leading to gasping and stertorous respiration with extension of the head and neck. Secondary bacterial pneumonia occurs in many cases. Chronic respiratory disease, such as nasal discharge, is common in surviving rabbits. Even in apparently recovered rabbits, it is not unusual to find lung lobes filled with fluid rather than air at necropsy.

Since the 1970s an &quot;amyxomatous&quot; form of the disease has been reported in Europe which lacks the cutaneous nodules typical of myxomatosis. This form is clinically milder and generally nonlethal. Respiratory signs, including clear or purulent nasal discharge, predominate. Perineal edema, swollen eyelids, and purulent blepharoconjunctivitis are generally still present. This form has been observed in wild rabbits, but is significant mainly in farmed rabbits.

== Clinical presentation: North American strains of myxomatosis ==

The distribution of Myxomatosis in North America is limited to the brush rabbit’s native habitat, which extends from the Columbia River in Oregon to the north, the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountains to the East, and the tip of the Baja California peninsula to the south.[3] The brush rabbit is the sole carrier of myxoma virus in North American because other native lagomorphs, including cottontail rabbits and hares, are incapable of transmitting the disease.[4][1] Clinical signs of myxomatosis depend on the strain of virus, the route of inoculation, and the immune status of the host. Cases of myxomatosis in northern California, southern California, Oregon, and Mexico are caused by different strains of myxoma virus, and symptoms vary. All North American strains are highly virulent, with close to 100% case fatality rates.

=== California ===

A 1931 paper reported twelve cases of myxomatosis from Santa Barbara, Ventura, and San Diego counties of California. Affected rabbits developed mucopurulent conjunctivitis and swelling of the nose, lips, ears, and external genitalia. Rabbits that survived for over a week developed cutaneous nodules on the face.

A 2024 study found that myxomatosis caused by the MSW strain (California/San Francisco 1950) of the myxoma virus occurs regularly in the greater San Jose and Santa Cruz regions of California. Common physical examination findings included swollen eyelids, swollen genitals, fever, and lethargy. Swollen lips and ears and subcutaneous edema also occurred in some rabbits. Domesticated rabbits that spent time outdoors were at greater risk of acquiring the disease, and most of the cases occurred between August and October. It was postulated that the number of cases brought to veterinarians underestimated the total number of cases, as sudden death was sometimes the first sign noted.

=== Oregon ===
A 1977 report from western Oregon described several cases of myxomatosis. The most common clinical signs observed were inflammation and swelling of the eyelids, conjunctiva, and anogenital region. Lethargy, fever, and anorexia were also observed. A single rabbit with confirmed myxomatosis eventually recovered.

A 2003 report of a myxomatosis outbreak in western Oregon reported sudden death as a common finding. Also noted were lethargy, swollen eyelids, and swollen genital regions.

=== Baja California ===
A 2000 report from the Baja Peninsula in Mexico described two outbreaks of myxomatosis in 1993. Affected domestic rabbits developed skin nodules and respiratory symptoms.

==Diagnosis==
Because the clinical signs of myxomatosis are distinctive and nearly pathognomonic, initial diagnosis is largely based on physical exam findings. If a rabbit dies without exhibiting the classic signs of myxomatosis, or if further confirmation is desired, a number of laboratory tests are available.

===Histopathology===
Tissues from rabbits suffering from myxomatosis show a number of changes on histopathology. Affected skin and mucous membranes typically show undifferentiated mesenchymal cells within a matrix of mucin, inflammatory cells, edema, and intracytoplasmic viral inclusion bodies. Spleen and lymph nodes are often affected by lymphoid depletion. Necrotizing appendicitis and secondary infections with gram-negative bacteria have also been described.

===Polymerase chain reaction===
The development of molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays has created faster and more accurate methods of myxoma virus identification. PCR can be used on swabs, fresh tissue samples, and on paraffin-embedded tissue samples to confirm the presence of the myxoma virus and as well as to identify the viral strain.

===Other Testing===
Other means of diagnosing myxomatosis include immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and virus isolation. Immunohistochemistry can demonstrate the presence of myxoma virus particles in different cells and tissues of the body. Negative-stain electron microscopic examination can be used to identify the presence of a poxvirus, although it does not allow specific verification of virus species or variants. Virus isolation remains the &quot;gold standard&quot; against which other methods of virus detection are compared. Theoretically at least, a single viable virus present in a specimen can be grown in cultured cells, thus expanding it to produce enough material to permit further detailed characterization.

== Treatment ==
At present, no specific treatment exists for myxomatosis. Given that the mortality rate of North American strains of myxomatosis nears 100%, euthanasia is often recommended in the United States. In other countries where less virulent strains are present and vaccines against the disease are available, supportive care may help rabbits to survive the infection. If treatment is attempted then careful monitoring is necessary to avoid prolonging suffering. Cessation of food and water intake, ongoing severe weight loss, or rectal temperatures below are reasons to consider euthanasia.

==Prevention==
=== Vaccination ===
Vaccines against myxomatosis are available in some countries. All are modified live vaccines based either on attenuated myxoma virus strains or on the closely related Shope fibroma virus, which provides cross-immunity. It is recommended that all rabbits in areas of the world where myxomatosis is endemic be routinely vaccinated, even if kept indoors, because of the ability of the virus to be carried inside by vectors or fomites. In group situations where rabbits are not routinely vaccinated, vaccination in the face of an outbreak is beneficial in limiting morbidity and mortality. The vaccine does not provide 100% protection, so it is still important to prevent contact with wild rabbits and insect vectors. Myxomatosis vaccines must be boostered regularly to remain effective, and annual vaccinations are usually recommended.

In Europe and the United Kingdom a bivalent vectored vaccine called Nobivac Myxo-RHD is available that protects against both myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease. This vaccine is licensed for immunization of rabbits 5 weeks of age or older, with onset of immunity taking approximately 3 weeks. Protection against myxomatosis and rabbit hemorrhagic disease has a duration of immunity for 12 months, and annual vaccination is recommended to ensure continued protection. The vaccine has been shown to reduce mortality and clinical signs of myxomatosis.

Vaccination against myxomatosis is currently prohibited in Australia due to concerns that the vaccine virus could spread to wild rabbits and increase their immunity to myxomatosis. As feral rabbits in Australia already cause a great deal of environmental damage, this concern is taken seriously by the government. Many pet rabbits in Australia continue to die from myxomatosis due to their lack of immunity. There is at least one campaign to allow the vaccine for domestic pets. The Australian Veterinary Association supports the introduction of a safe and effective myxomatosis vaccine for pet rabbits, and the RSPCA of Australia has repeatedly called for a review of available myxoma virus vaccines and a scientific assessment of their likely impacts in the Australian setting.

Although myxomatosis is endemic in parts of Mexico and the United States, there is no commercially available vaccine in either of these countries.

===Other preventive measures===
In locations where myxomatosis is endemic but no vaccine is available, preventing exposure to the myxoma virus is of vital importance. The risk of a pet contracting myxomatosis can be reduced by preventing contact with wild rabbits, and by keeping rabbits indoors (preferred) or behind screens to prevent mosquito exposure. Using rabbit-safe medications to treat and prevent fleas, lice, and mites is also warranted. New rabbits that could have been exposed to the virus should be quarantined for 14 days before being introduced to current pets.

Any rabbit suspected of having myxomatosis should be immediately isolated, and all rabbits in the area moved indoors. To prevent the virus from spreading further any cages and cage furnishings that have come into contact with infected rabbits should be disinfected, and owners should disinfect their hands between rabbits. Poxviruses are stable in the environment and can be spread by fomites but are highly sensitive to chemical disinfection; bleach, ammonia, and alcohol can all be used to deactivate myxoma virus.

==Reporting==
Myxomatosis is a reportable disease in California, the United States, and in Mexico. Veterinarians and pet owners who see this disease are encouraged to report all cases to the relevant agencies. Without accurate data on myxomatosis in North America, vaccine manufacturers will underestimate the need for a vaccine and be reluctant to produce one.

== Use as a population control agent ==
Myxoma virus was the first virus intentionally introduced into the wild with the purpose of eradicating a vertebrate pest, namely the European rabbit in Australia and Europe. The long-term failure of this strategy has been due to natural selective pressures on both the rabbit and virus populations, which resulted in the emergence of myxomatosis-resistant animals and attenuated virus variants. The process is regarded as a classical example of host–pathogen coevolution following cross-species transmission of a pathogen.

===Australia===


European rabbits were brought to Australia in 1788 by early English settlers. Initially used as a food source, they later became feral and their numbers soared. In November 1937, the Australian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research used Wardang Island to conduct its first field trials of myxomatosis, which established the methodology for the successful release of the myxoma virus throughout the country.

In 1950, the SLS strain of myxoma virus from the South American tapeti (&quot;Sylvilagus brasiliensis&quot;) was released in Australia as a biological control agent against feral rabbits. The virus was at first highly lethal, with an estimated case fatality rate of close to 99.8%. Within a few years, however, this strain was replaced by less virulent ones, which permitted longer survival of infected rabbits and enhanced disease transmission. The virus created strong selection pressure for the evolution of rabbits resistant to myxomatosis. As rabbits became more resistant the viral strains responded by becoming less virulent. Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus has also been used to control wild rabbit populations in Australia since 1995.

===Europe===
In June 1952, Paul-Félix Armand-Delille, the owner of an estate in northwestern France, inoculated two wild rabbits with the Lausanne strain of myxoma virus. His intention was to only eradicate rabbits on his property and town, but the disease quickly spread through Western Europe, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Some dissemination of the virus clearly appeared deliberate, such as the introduction into Britain in 1953 and the introduction into Ireland in 1954. Unlike in Australia, however, strenuous efforts were made to stop the spread in Europe. These efforts proved in vain. According to estimates, the wild rabbit population in the United Kingdom fell by 99%, in France by 90% to 95%, and in Spain by 95%. This in turn drove specialized rabbit predators, such as the Iberian lynx and the Spanish imperial eagle, to the brink of extinction.

Myxomatosis not only decreased the wild rabbit population and the population of its natural predators, but also had significant impacts on the large rabbit-farming industry, which produced domestic rabbits for meat and fur. The Lausanne strain of the myxoma virus causes the formation of large purple skin-nodules, a sign not seen in other strains. As happened in Australia, the virus has generally become less virulent and the wild rabbit populations more resistant subsequently.

=== New Zealand ===
The introduction of myxomatosis into New Zealand in 1952 to control a burgeoning rabbit problem failed for lack of a vector.

===South America===
Two pairs of European rabbits set free in 1936 at Punta Santa Maria resulted in an infestation that spread over the northern half of Tierra del Fuego. More rabbits were introduced in 1950 near Ushuaia by the Argentinian Navy and a private rabbit farmer. The rabbits quickly became pests, riddling the ground with holes and leaving it bare of grass. By 1953 the rabbit population numbered about 30 million. In 1954 Chilean authorities introduced a Brazilian strain of myxoma virus to Tierra del Fuego, which succeeded in bringing rabbits to very low population levels.

== Use as an evolutionary model ==
Given the importance of viral evolution to disease emergence, pathogenesis, drug resistance, and vaccine efficacy, it has been well studied by theoreticians and experimentalists. The introductions of myxoma virus into European rabbit populations in Australia and France created natural experiments in virulence evolution. While initial viral strains were highly virulent, attenuated strains were soon recovered from the field. These attenuated strains, which allowed rabbits to survive longer, came to dominate because they were more readily transmitted. As the complete genome sequences of multiple myxoma strains have been published, scientists have been able to pinpoint exactly which genes are responsible for the changes in the myxoma virus&#x27;s virulence and behavior.

However, the evolution of the disease has proved to be increasingly complex and unpredictable, both among various strains of host, and among strains of the virus. Both in modes of resistance and of virulence, and in all countries in which the virus has been introduced for control of feral rabbits, the hosts and the pathogens have continually adapted in various ways to evolutionary challenges. Although current strains of myxomatosis do not provide sufficient control on their own, the disease remains a significant ecological factor in rabbit control, both in Australia and in other countries. For example, in spite of long-term concern in Australia especially, where the initial virulence of myxomatosis declined after a few decades in the field, rabbit evolution of resistance to the disease has not gone unchallenged. For some recent strains of the virus, as a case in point, selection for reduced inflammation prolongs virus replication, which enhances transmission and reduces suppression of the virus by the host&#x27;s fever; it also may cause immunosuppression, which favors high virulence. Studies continue, both in the contexts of rabbit control, and of the relevant evolutionary principles.

== In culture ==
Myxomatosis is referred to as &quot;the white blindness&quot; by the rabbit characters of the novel &quot;Watership Down&quot; (1972) by Richard Adams, and in the story a rabbit chief had driven out all rabbits who seemed to be afflicted. In one of the novel&#x27;s folk tales about the rabbit hero El-ahrairah, the transmission of the disease is explained to him by the lord of the rabbit underworld, the Black Rabbit of Inle (&quot;it is carried by the fleas in rabbits&#x27; ears; they pass from the ears of a sick rabbit to those of his companions&quot;).

The sixth album of British band Radiohead, &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot;, contains a song &quot;Myxomatosis&quot;. The disease is used as analogy to the journalist attention the band has. Thom Yorke has said:

&quot;I remember my parents pointing out all these dead rabbits on the road when I was a kid. I didn’t know that much about the virus, or even how to spell it, but I loved the word. I loved the way it sounded.&quot;

<text>The Isles of Shoals are a group of small islands and tidal ledges situated approximately off the east coast of the United States, straddling the border of the states of Maine and New Hampshire.

They have been occupied for more than 400 years, first by fishing communities and more recently as the site of private homes, a large seasonal hotel and a marine research facility.

== History ==
Some of the islands were used for seasonal fishing camps by Indigenous peoples and first settled by Europeans in the early 17th century. They became one of the many fishing areas for the young British and French colonies. This was one of the most northern fishing ports, the closest one to the south being Rockport, Massachusetts. The Isles of Shoals were named the &quot;Smith Iles&quot; by English explorer Capt. John Smith after sighting them in 1614. This name did not last once colonization of New England by the British began. The first recorded landfall of an Englishman was that of explorer Captain Christopher Levett, whose 300 fishermen in six ships discovered that the Isles of Shoals were largely abandoned in 1623.

&quot;The first place I set my foot upon in New England was the Isle of Shoals, being islands in the sea about two leagues from the main,&quot; Levett wrote later. &quot;Upon these islands I neither could see one good timber-tree nor so much good ground as to make a garden. The place is found to be a good fishing-place for six ships, but more can not be well there, for want of convenient stage room, as this year&#x27;s experience hath proved.&quot;

In 1628 the Plymouth Pilgrims exiled Thomas Morton on the island due to his libertine activities with the Indians at Merrymount.

The first town, &quot;Apledoore&quot;, included all of the Isles of Shoals, and was incorporated by the General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony on May 22, 1661. At that time, the province of New Hampshire and the province of Maine were both part of Massachusetts Bay Colony. By 1665, the name of the town had changed to &quot;Iles of Shoales&quot;. Starting in 1680 and continuing for several years, there was a general migration of the population to Star Island in what is now New Hampshire, departing from Hog Island (now known as Appledore) in what is now Maine. In 1696, the town was annexed by Kittery. In 1715 the township of Gosport was established by New Hampshire on Star Island.

The Gosport community was fairly prosperous up until about 1778, when the islanders were evacuated to Rye, New Hampshire, due to the Revolutionary War. Though a small population remained, the islands were largely abandoned until the middle of the 19th century, when Thomas Laighton and Levi Thaxter opened a popular summer hotel on Appledore Island. Laighton&#x27;s daughter, Celia, married Levi at the age of fifteen and as Celia Thaxter became the most popular American female poet of the 19th century. She hosted an arts community on the island frequented by authors including Nathaniel Hawthorne, John Greenleaf Whittier, Oliver Wendell Holmes and Sarah Orne Jewett, and the Impressionist painter Childe Hassam. Having executed his last drawing three days previous, the Boston painter William Morris Hunt drowned there in 1879, reportedly a suicide. Hunt&#x27;s body was discovered by Celia Thaxter.

William James visited the Isles of Shoals in 1873. His experiences were recalled in a letter to brother Henry James dated July 14-16 [1873]. At one point he reminisces, &quot;I just lay around drinking the air and the light and the sounds. I succeeded in reading no word for three days, and then took Goethe&#x27;s Gedichte out on my walks, and with them in my memory, the smell of the laurels and pines in my nose, and the rhythmic pounding of the surf upon my ear, I was free and happy again.

The popularity of Laighton&#x27;s Appledore House soon led to establishment of the Mid-Ocean House on Smuttynose Island, and the Oceanic Hotel, which is still in use today on Star Island.
==Appledore Island==
Appledore Island, in Maine, is the largest of the Isles of Shoals, at . Formerly known as Hog Island, and prior to that as Farm Island, it is approximately from east to west, and from north to south. It was home to a large hotel, The Appledore House, during the 19th century. Built in 1847 and opened the following year, the hotel was lost to a fire in 1914. According to Celia Thaxter, as late as 1873, &quot;Philip Babb, or some evil-minded descendant of his, haunted Appledore.&quot; Today, the island is the operating station of the Shoals Marine Laboratory, run cooperatively by Cornell University and the University of New Hampshire. The island is mostly owned by the Star Island Corporation.

==Star Island==
Second in size at , Star Island is located in New Hampshire within the borders of the town of Rye and is the only island served by a commercial boat from the mainland. It is a religious and educational conference center, owned by the Star Island Corporation, which is affiliated with the Unitarian Universalist Association and the United Church of Christ. During the summer, the island hosts a number of week-long and shorter conferences which make use of the Oceanic Hotel, Gosport House, the over 200-year-old chapel, and several buildings dating back to the original village. Short-term day visitors are also welcomed, although that may depend on the boat schedule. This is also a popular destination for sailboats wishing to tie up overnight in Gosport harbor.

==Smuttynose and Malaga Islands==
Smuttynose Island, at , is the third-largest island. It is allegedly the site of Blackbeard&#x27;s honeymoon, later for the shipwreck of the Spanish ship &quot;Sagunto&quot; in 1813, and then for the notorious 1873 murders of two young women. The latter is recalled in the story, &quot;A Memorable Murder&quot;, by Celia Thaxter, in the 1997 novel, &quot;The Weight of Water&quot;, by Anita Shreve (and in the 2000 film), and in the song, &quot;The Ballad of Louis Wagner&quot; by John Perrault. There are two small houses on the island. One of them, the Samuel Haley house, was once believed to be the oldest structure in the state of Maine. Smuttynose is not populated today, but the Stewards of Smuttynose Island, a group consisting of volunteer individuals and families, participate in the care and upkeep of the two historic dwellings and grounds of the island.

Malaga Island is a diminutive island just to the west of Smuttynose, connected to it by a breakwater. The original breakwater was built around 1820 by Captain Samuel Haley, who is reputed to have paid for its construction with proceeds from four bars of pirate silver that he found under a flat rock on the island.

==White and Seavey Islands==
White Island and Seavey Island are located at the southern end of the Isles of Shoals, within the borders of the town of Rye, New Hampshire. During low tide, the two islands are connected by a land bridge.

White Island is dominated by Isles of Shoals Light, now automated, and the keeper&#x27;s house. The lighthouse, one of two on the New Hampshire coast, and associated buildings are now owned by the state of New Hampshire. The island hosts a coastal weather station which frequently records sustained hurricane-force winds from Nor&#x27;easter coastal storms in the winter, due to the exposed nature of the island. The lighthouse tower was restored in 2005 as the result of the efforts of a group of seventh graders in nearby North Hampton, known as the Lighthouse Kids (a chapter of the American Lighthouse Foundation). Poet Celia Thaxter grew up on this island before moving to Smuttynose Island and eventually Appledore Island.

Seavey Island has been the site of a tern restoration project conducted by the Audubon Society of New Hampshire in recent years.

==Other islands==
Lunging, Duck, and Cedar islands are also part of the Isles of Shoals. Lunging, on the New Hampshire side of the border, formerly Londoner&#x27;s Island, was the site of an early trading post for codfish. Today it is privately owned.

Duck and Cedar are islands on the Maine side. Duck Island lies about to the north and once was used as a bombing range for the US Navy. It was sold by the Star Island Corporation to Maine Coast Heritage Trust in 2002, and was transferred to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2003. It is kept as a wildlife sanctuary. It is home to a seal colony and has never supported a human population.

Cedar Island is connected by breakwaters to both Smuttynose Island and Star Island and is privately 
owned.

<doc id="213946" wikidata="Q2713091" url="?curid=213946" title="No More Mr. Nice Guy (Gang Starr album)">
<text>No More Mr. Nice Guy is the debut studio album by American hip hop duo Gang Starr. The album was released on June 6, 1989. It peaked at No. 83 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. The song &quot;Positivity&quot; peaked at No. 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; rap chart.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that some songs &quot;are more concerned with educating and relating than with egos and bragging, using hot soul-flavored dance beats and infusions of jazz.&quot; &quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that &quot;DJ Premier provides samples, beats and rhythms that are perfectly adequate, if not up to his future level.&quot;

== Track listing ==
All songs are produced by DJ Premier &amp; Guru, except for tracks 5 &amp; 13, produced by the 45 King

The PRT Records cassette issue in the UK contains &quot;Movin&#x27; On (Vocal)&quot; and &quot;Movin&#x27; On (Dub)&quot; as bonus tracks B7 and B8.

<doc id="213948" wikidata="Q477328" url="?curid=213948" title="Group of 77">
<text>The Group of 77 (G77) at the United Nations (UN) is a coalition of developing countries, designed to promote its members&#x27; collective economic interests and create an enhanced joint negotiating capacity in the United Nations. The group consists of a diverse set of states with a common South-South ideology. There were 77 founding members of the organization headquartered in Geneva, but it has since expanded to 134 member countries. Iraq holds its chairmanship for 2025, succeeding Uganda.

The group was founded on 15 June 1964, by 77 non-aligned nations in the &quot;Joint Declaration of the Seventy-Seven Countries&quot; issued at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The first major meeting was in Algiers in 1967, where the &quot;Charter of Algiers&quot; was adopted and the basis for permanent institutional structures was begun under the leadership of Raul Prebisch who had previously worked at ECLA. There are &quot;Chapters of the Group of 77&quot; in Geneva (UN), Rome (FAO), Vienna (UNIDO), Paris (UNESCO), Nairobi (UNEP) and the Group of 24 in Washington, D.C. (International Monetary Fund and World Bank).

==Policies==
The group was credited with a common stance against apartheid and for supporting global disarmament. It has been supportive of the New International Economic Order.

Regarding environmental matters, the G77&#x27;s position is that the developed countries bear historical responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions, pointing also to the disparity in per capita emissions between the developing and developed countries. As a result, the G77 often resists binding commitments to reduce its emissions. The G77 has been subject to criticism for its lacklustre support, or outright opposition, to pro-environmental initiatives, which the group considers secondary to economic development and poverty eradication initiatives. In turn, the G77 has criticized the wealthier nations for their insufficient attention to poverty eradication, including at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

== Members ==
As of 2023, the group comprises all of the UN member states (along with the UN observer State of Palestine), excluding the following countries:

# Members of the Council of Europe, except for Azerbaijan.
# Members of the Commonwealth of Independent States Free Trade Area, except for Tajikistan.
# Members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, except for all its (four) Latin American members.
# Two microstates in Oceania: Palau and Tuvalu.

===Current founding members===

Source:

=== Other current members ===
=== Former members ===
# signed the original &quot;Joint Declaration of the Developing Countries&quot; in October 1963 but pulled out of the group before the formation of the G77 in 1964 (it joined the OECD in 1973).
# was a founding member but left the Group after joining the OECD in 1996.
# was a founding member; by the late 1990s, it was still listed on the membership list, but it was noted that it &quot;cannot participate in the activities of G77.&quot; It was removed from the list in late 2003. It had presided over the group from 1985 to 1986.
#* was the only former Yugoslavian state to be listed as a member on the G77 official website in 2007; it was removed from the member list in February 2020.
# was a founding member but was no longer listed on the official membership list after it acceded to the European Union in 2004. A document from 1975 states that Cyprus is not a member.
# was a founding member, while North Vietnam never joined separately.
# joined separately from founding member North Yemen sometime between 1967 and 1975.
# was admitted to the Group in 1976 but was no longer listed on the official membership list after it acceded to the European Union in 2004.
# joined the Group in 2002 but withdrew in 2004, having decided that it could best pursue its environmental interests through the Alliance of Small Island States.
# was classed as a Latin American country for the purposes of the G77, having joined in 1976. The G77 was divided into geographical regions, and because there was technically no European area, Romania was placed under the umbrella of Latin America. Romania left the G77 following its accession to the European Union.

=== China ===
The Group of 77 lists China as one of its members. The Chinese government provides consistent political support to the G77 and has made financial contributions to the Group since 1994, but it does not consider itself to be a member. As a result, official statements of the G77 are delivered in the name of The Group of 77 and China or G77+China.

== Presiding countries ==
The following is the chain of succession of the chairmanship of the G77:

==Group of 24==


The Group of 24 (G-24) is a chapter of the G-77 that was established in 1971 to coordinate the positions of developing countries on international monetary and development finance issues and to ensure that their interests were adequately represented in negotiations on international monetary matters. Every member of the G-24 is also a member of the G77.

<doc id="213956" wikidata="Q2115189" url="?curid=213956" title="Susan Aglukark">
<text>Susan Aglukark, (Inuktitut syllabics: ᓲᓴᓐ ᐊᒡᓘᒃᑲᖅ &quot;suusan agluukkaq&quot;; born 27 January 1967) is a Canadian singer whose blend of Inuit folk music traditions with country and pop songwriting has made her a major recording star in Canada. Her most successful song/single is &quot;O Siem&quot;, which reached No. 1 on the Canadian country and adult contemporary charts in 1995. Overall, she has released seven studio albums and has won three Juno Awards.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Aglukark was born in Churchill, Manitoba, and raised in Arviat, Northwest Territories (now in Nunavut). She endured sexual abuse as a child and has been vocal about this issue in some of the first nations in Northern Ontario. After graduating from high school, she worked in Ottawa, Ontario, as a linguist with the Department of Indian &amp; Northern Affairs, and then returned to the Northwest Territories to work as an executive assistant with the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada.

===Career===
While working with the Inuit Tapirisat, she began to perform as a singer, and quickly became a popular performer in Inuit communities. She soon attracted the attention of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, who included her in a compilation of Arctic performers. In 1992, she released an independent album, &quot;Arctic Rose&quot;. The following year, she signed to a major record label, releasing an album of Christmas music that year.

Aglukark has also acted as spokesperson for several non-profit groups working with aboriginal and Inuit youth, notably through her writing workshops for Attawapiskat First Nation youth and her involvement in Northern Canada&#x27;s food crisis. However, she has said that while she is proud to be a role model for aboriginal people in Canada, she ultimately sees herself as an artist with a universal message of self-respect and strength to which she hopes that people of all cultural backgrounds can relate.

===This Child===
&quot;This Child&quot;, released in 1995, became her breakthrough album. The first single from that album, &quot;O Siem&quot;, went to number one on the Canadian adult contemporary and country charts that year, making Aglukark the first Inuk performer to have a Top 40 hit. &quot;Hina Na Ho (Celebration)&quot; and &quot;Breakin&#x27; Down&quot; became hit singles as well. The album was eventually certified triple platinum (300,000 copies sold) in Canada.

===Unsung Heroes===
In 2000, Aglukark released &quot;Unsung Heroes&quot;, which spawned another pop hit with &quot;One Turn Deserves Another.&quot; This album also included &quot;Turn of the Century,&quot; a song about the creation of Nunavut. In 2004, she released &quot;Big Feeling&quot;.

She sometimes deals with painful subjects in her songs. &quot;Kathy&quot; is about her niece who died by suicide, and &quot;Still Running&quot; is about the trauma of sexual abuse. Aglukark has also recorded a version of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; in Inuktitut.

Her song &quot;Never Be the Same&quot; was featured on &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; in Episode No. 3–14 (&quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre&quot;), as well as her song &quot;One Turn Deserves Another&quot; in Episode No. 3–15 (&quot;Crime And Punishment&quot;).

Aglukark&#x27;s second holiday album, &quot;Dreaming of Home&quot;, was released on 5 November 2013.

She currently resides in Oakville, Ontario.

== Awards and recognition ==
In 2004, Aglukark was awarded an honorary DFA from the University of Lethbridge. She was named an officer of the Order of Canada in 2005, and in the same year received an honorary LL.D. degree from the University of Alberta.

Aglukark is the author of a series of historically based picture books, published by Inhabit Media Inc, which draws on the experiences of her grandmother&#x27;s childhood to examine the unique perspective of living in the Arctic at. time when traditional Inuit values began to mix with outside influences and objects. Each volume in the series examines the feelings of anticipation, excitement, loss, and resilience experienced by Inuit as their world began to change through the introduction of outside influences. Seen through the eyes of one little girl as she navigates life in her camp with her family, this series gives young readers a window into a unique time in Arctic history.

<text>Winthrop Mackworth Praed (28 July 180215 July 1839)—typically written as W. Mackworth Praed—was an English politician and poet.

==Life==

===Early life===
Praed was born in London, United Kingdom. The family name of Praed was derived from the marriage of the poet&#x27;s great-grandfather to a Cornish heiress. Winthrop&#x27;s father, William Mackworth Praed, was a serjeant-at-law (1756–1835) and a revising barrister for Bath. His mother belonged to the English branch of the New England family of Winthrop.

In 1814 Praed was sent to Eton College, where he founded a manuscript periodical called &quot;Apis matina&quot;. This was succeeded in October 1820 by the &quot;Etonian&quot;, a paper projected and edited by Praed and Walter Blount, which appeared every month until July 1821, when the chief editor, who signed his contributions &quot;Peregrine Courtenay,&quot; left Eton, and the paper died. Henry Nelson Coleridge, William Sidney Walker, and John Moultrie were the three best known of his collaborators on this periodical, which was published by Charles Knight, and of which details are given in Knight&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography&quot; and in Henry Maxwell Lyte&#x27;s &quot;Eton College&quot;.

Before Praed left school he had established, over a shop at Eton, a &quot;boys&#x27; library,&quot; the books of which were later amalgamated in the School Library. His career at Trinity College, Cambridge was a brilliant one. He gained the Browne medal for Greek verse four times and the Chancellor&#x27;s Gold Medal for English verse twice in 1823 and 1824. He was bracketed third in the classical tripos in 1825, won a fellowship at his college in 1827, and three years later carried off the Seatonian prize. At the Union his speeches were rivalled only by those of Macaulay and of Charles Austin, who subsequently made a great reputation at the parliamentary bar. The character of Praed during his university life is described by Bulwer-Lytton in the first volume of his &quot;Life&quot;.

===Political career===
Praed began to study law, and in 1829 was called to the bar at the Middle Temple. On the Norfolk circuit, his prospects of advancement were bright, but his inclination was towards politics, and after a year or two he took up political life. Whilst at Cambridge he tended to Whiggism, and up to the end of 1829 he continued to have these sympathies, but during the agitation for parliamentary reform his opinions changed, and when he was returned to parliament for St Germans (17 December 1830), his election was due to the Tory party. He sat for that borough until December 1832, and on its extinction contested the borough of St Ives, within the limits of which the Cornish estates of the Praeds were situated.

The pieces he wrote on this occasion were collected in a volume printed at Penzance in 1833 and entitled &quot;Trash&quot;, dedicated without respect to James Halse, M.P., his successful opponent. Praed sat for Great Yarmouth from 1835 to 1837, and was Secretary to the Board of Control during Sir Robert Peel&#x27;s short administration. He sat for Aylesbury from 1837 until his death. During the progress of the Reform Act 1832 he advocated the creation of three-cornered constituencies, in which each voter should have the power of giving two votes only, and maintained that freeholds within boroughs should confer votes for the boroughs and not for the county. Neither of these suggestions was then adopted, but the former ultimately formed part of the Reform Act 1867.

===Personal life===
In 1835, he married Helen Bogle. He died of tuberculosis at Chester Square, London, at age 36.

==Works==
W. Mackworth Praed was famed for his verse charades. H. Austin Dobson praised Praed&#x27;s &quot;sparkling wit, the clearness and finish of his style, and the flexibility and unflagging vivacity of his rhythm&quot; (Humphry Ward&#x27;s &quot;English Poets&quot;). His verse abounded in allusions to the characters and follies of the day. His humour was much imitated.

His poems were first edited by Rufus Wilmot Griswold (New York, 1844); another American edition, by W. A. Whitmore, appeared in 1859; an authorized edition with a memoir by Derwent Coleridge appeared in 1864: &quot;The Political and Occasional Poems of W. M. Praed&quot; (1888), edited with notes by his nephew, Sir George Young, included many pieces collected from various newspapers and periodicals. Sir George Young separated from his work some poems, the work of his friend Edward FitzGerald, generally confused with his. Praed&#x27;s essays, contributed to various magazines, were published in Morley&#x27;s &quot;Universal Library&quot; in 1887.

==Legacy==
Praed was not only successful at Eton during his lifetime, but a society still exists that bears his name. The &quot;Praed&quot; society is the poetry society currently existing at Eton. It meets at a master&#x27;s house and membership is by invitation.

<doc id="213966" wikidata="Q7269684" url="?curid=213966" title="Boston Confucians">
<text>The Boston Confucians are a group of New Confucians from Boston, of whom the best known are Tu Wei-Ming of Harvard, John Berthrong and Robert Neville of Boston University. Boston Confucianism belongs to the larger discussion of what it means to study and practice Confucianism in a context outside China and East Asia and the significance of Confucianism for modern-day American life.

==Boston Confucianism==
Boston Confucianism refers to those who hold that Confucianism could be successfully adapted to a Western perspective. Confucianism is seen as a tradition with rich spiritual and cultural resources that can inform other world traditions. Boston Confucianism also argues for the transportability of Confucianism to geographical locations beyond Asia proper. The internationalized character of Boston Confucianism is to a great extent a central feature in the second generation of the New Confucians. Both Platonism and Christianity began as such portable traditions, which could be practiced outside of the Greek and Jewish roots which originally generated them.

However, this is a view that is common to New Confucians in general, whether from Boston, Beijing, Taipei, Hong Kong or Singapore. Indeed, there are contemporary advocates of Confucianism who are not New Confucians, but who would agree that Confucianism is not geographically or culturally parochial, any more than Buddhism or Islam have been. Philip J. Ivanhoe, Joel J. Kupperman and David B. Wong would fall into this latter category. Consequently, &quot;Boston Confucian&quot; is a term more closely linked to geography than intellectual content. Boston Confucianism seeks to explore different applications of Confucianism in the age of globalization.

The school of Boston Confucianism has become especially well known in academic circles in China. Chinese scholars see it as the first indication of Confucianism&#x27;s ability to be enthusiastically endorsed by non-Asian North-American scholars and theologians for non-academic purposes.

Bin Song, who received a Ph.D. from Boston University and now teaches at Washington College, has published a range of articles in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; about Boston Confucianism.

==Key texts==
In his 1988 essay &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;, Tu Wei-ming (1988) wrote:

Copernicus decentered the earth, Darwin relativized the god-like image of man, Marx exploded the ideology of social harmony, and Freud complicated our conscious life. They have redefined humanity for the modern age. Yet they have also empowered us, with a communal, critical self-awareness, to renew our faith in the ancient Confucian wisdom that the globe is the center of our universe and the only home for us, and that we are the guardians of the good earth, the trustees of the mandate of Heaven that enjoins us to make our bodies healthy, our hearts sensitive, our minds alert, our souls refined and our spirits brilliant [...] We are here because embedded in our human nature is the secret code for heaven’s self-realization. Heaven is certainly omnipresent, may even be omniscient, but is most likely not omnipotent. It needs our active participation to realize its own truth. We are heaven’s partners, indeed co creators. We serve heaven with common sense, the lack of which nowadays has brought us to the brink of self-destruction. Since we help heaven to realize itself through our self-discovery and self-understanding in day-to-day living, the ultimate meaning of life is found in our ordinary human existence.

&quot;The Western Inscription&quot; by the 11th century Confucian Chang Tsai is a favorite of the Boston Confucians, according to John Berthrong, as it points toward ecological concerns:

Heaven is my father and earth is my mother, and even such a small creature as I finds an intimate place in their midst. Therefore, that which extends throughout the universe I regard as my body and that which directs the universe I consider as my nature. All people are my brothers and sisters and all things are my companions. Respect the aged [...] Show affection toward the orphaned and weak [...] The sage identifies his character with Heaven and earth, and the virtuous man is best {among the children of Heaven and earth}. Even those who are tired and infirm, crippled and sick, those who have no brothers or children, wives or husbands, are all my brothers who are in distress and have no one to turn to.

<text>Relative atomic mass (symbol: A; sometimes abbreviated RAM or r.a.m.), also known by the deprecated synonym atomic weight, is a dimensionless physical quantity defined as the ratio of the average mass of atoms of a chemical element in a given sample to the atomic mass constant. The atomic mass constant (symbol: &quot;m&quot;) is defined as being of the mass of a carbon-12 atom. Since both quantities in the ratio are masses, the resulting value is dimensionless. These definitions remain valid even after the 2019 revision of the SI.

For a single given sample, the relative atomic mass of a given element is the weighted arithmetic mean of the masses of the individual atoms (including all its isotopes) that are present in the sample. This quantity can vary significantly between samples because the sample&#x27;s origin (and therefore its radioactive history or diffusion history) may have produced combinations of isotopic abundances in varying ratios. For example, due to a different mixture of stable carbon-12 and carbon-13 isotopes, a sample of elemental carbon from volcanic methane will have a different relative atomic mass than one collected from plant or animal tissues.

The more common, and more specific quantity known as standard atomic weight (&quot;A&quot;) is an application of the relative atomic mass values obtained from many different samples. It is sometimes interpreted as the &quot;expected range&quot; of the relative atomic mass values for the atoms of a given element from all terrestrial sources, with the various sources being taken from Earth. &quot;Atomic weight&quot; is often loosely and incorrectly used as a synonym for standard atomic weight (incorrectly because standard atomic weights are not from a single sample). Standard atomic weight is nevertheless the most widely published variant of relative atomic mass.

Additionally, the continued use of the term &quot;atomic weight&quot; (for any element) as opposed to &quot;relative atomic mass&quot; has attracted considerable controversy since at least the 1960s, mainly due to the technical difference between weight and mass in physics. Still, both terms are officially sanctioned by the IUPAC. The term &quot;relative atomic mass&quot; now seems to be replacing &quot;atomic weight&quot; as the preferred term, although the term &quot;&quot;standard&quot; atomic weight&quot; (as opposed to the more correct &quot;&quot;standard&quot; relative atomic mass&quot;) continues to be used.

== Definition ==

Relative atomic mass is determined by the average atomic mass, or the weighted mean of the atomic masses of all the atoms of a particular chemical element found in a particular sample, which is then compared to the atomic mass of carbon-12. This comparison is the quotient of the two weights, which makes the value dimensionless (having no unit). This quotient also explains the word &quot;relative&quot;: the sample mass value is considered relative to that of carbon-12.

It is a synonym for atomic weight, though it is not to be confused with relative isotopic mass. Relative atomic mass is also frequently used as a synonym for standard atomic weight and these quantities may have overlapping values if the relative atomic mass used is that for an element from Earth under defined conditions. However, relative atomic mass (atomic weight) is still technically distinct from standard atomic weight because of its application only to the atoms obtained from a single sample; it is also not restricted to terrestrial samples, whereas standard atomic weight averages multiple samples but only from terrestrial sources. Relative atomic mass is therefore a more general term that can more broadly refer to samples taken from non-terrestrial environments or highly specific terrestrial environments which may differ substantially from Earth-average or reflect different degrees of certainty (e.g., in number of significant figures) than those reflected in standard atomic weights.

=== Current definition ===

The prevailing IUPAC definitions (as taken from the &quot;Gold Book&quot;) are:
: &quot;atomic weight&quot; – See: relative atomic mass
and
: &quot;relative atomic mass (atomic weight)&quot; – The ratio of the average mass of the atom to the unified atomic mass unit.
Here the &quot;unified atomic mass unit&quot; refers to 1/12 of the mass of an atom of C &quot;in its ground state&quot;.

The IUPAC definition of relative atomic mass is:
: An atomic weight (relative atomic mass) of an element from a specified source is the ratio of the average mass per atom of the element to 1/12 of the mass of an atom of C.

The definition deliberately specifies &quot;An atomic weight ...&quot;, as an element will have different relative atomic masses depending on the source. For example, boron from Turkey has a lower relative atomic mass than boron from California, because of its different isotopic composition. Nevertheless, given the cost and difficulty of isotope analysis, it is common practice to instead substitute the tabulated values of standard atomic weights, which are ubiquitous in chemical laboratories and which are revised biennially by the IUPAC&#x27;s Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights (CIAAW).

=== Historical usage ===

Older (pre-1961) historical relative scales based on the atomic mass unit (symbol: &quot;a.m.u.&quot; or &quot;amu&quot;) used either the oxygen-16 relative isotopic mass or else the oxygen relative atomic mass (i.e., atomic weight) for reference. See the article on the history of the modern unified atomic mass unit for the resolution of these problems.

== Standard atomic weight ==
The IUPAC commission CIAAW maintains an expectation-interval value for relative atomic mass (or atomic weight) on Earth named standard atomic weight. Standard atomic weight requires the sources be terrestrial, natural, and stable with regard to radioactivity. Also, there are requirements for the research process. For 84 stable elements, CIAAW has determined this standard atomic weight. These values are widely published and referred to loosely as &#x27;the&#x27; atomic weight of elements for real-life substances like pharmaceuticals and commercial trade. 

Also, CIAAW has published abridged (rounded) values and simplified values (for when the Earthly sources vary systematically).

== Other measures of the mass of atoms ==

Atomic mass (&quot;m&quot;a) is the mass of a single atom. It defines the mass of a specific isotope, which is an input value for the determination of the relative atomic mass. An example for three silicon isotopes is given below. A convenient unit of mass for atomic mass is the dalton (Da), which is also called the unified atomic mass unit (u).

The relative &quot;isotopic&quot; mass is the &quot;ratio of&quot; the mass of a single atom to the atomic mass constant (). This ratio is dimensionless.

== Determination of relative atomic mass ==
Modern relative atomic masses (a term specific to a given element sample) are calculated from measured values of atomic mass (for each nuclide) and isotopic composition of a sample. Highly accurate atomic masses are available for virtually all non-radioactive nuclides, but isotopic compositions are both harder to measure to high precision and more subject to variation between samples. For this reason, the relative atomic masses of the 22 mononuclidic elements (which are the same as the isotopic masses for each of the single naturally occurring nuclides of these elements) are known to especially high accuracy. For example, there is an uncertainty of only one part in 38 million for the relative atomic mass of fluorine, a precision which is greater than the current best value for the Avogadro constant (one part in 20 million).

The calculation is exemplified for silicon, whose relative atomic mass is especially important in metrology. Silicon exists in nature as a mixture of three isotopes: Si, Si and Si. The atomic masses of these nuclides are known to a precision of one part in 14 billion for Si and about one part in one billion for the others. However, the range of natural abundance for the isotopes is such that the standard abundance can only be given to about ±0.001% (see table).

The calculation is as follows:
: &quot;A&quot;(Si) = ( × ) + ( × ) + ( × ) = 

The estimation of the uncertainty is complicated, especially as the sample distribution is not necessarily symmetrical: the IUPAC standard relative atomic masses are quoted with estimated symmetrical uncertainties, and the value for silicon is 28.0855(3). The relative standard uncertainty in this value is or 10 ppm. 

Apart from this uncertainty by measurement, some elements have variation over sources. That is, different sources (ocean water, rocks) have a different radioactive history and so different isotopic composition. To reflect this natural variability, the IUPAC made the decision in 2010 to list the standard relative atomic masses of 10 elements as an interval rather than a fixed number.

<text>Anna Brownell Jameson (17 May 179417 March 1860) was an Anglo-Irish art historian whose work spanned art and literary criticism, philosophy, travel writing, and feminism. She became very well known for her extensive writings. Jameson was connected to some of the most prominent names of the period including Joanna Baillie, Fanny Kemble, Elizabeth Barrett-Browning and Robert Browning, Harriet Martineau, Ottilie von Goethe (the daughter-in-law of Goethe), Lady Byron, Harriet Hosmer, Ada Lovelace, Charles and Elizabeth Eastlake, and Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon.

==Biography==
Anna Murphy was born in Dublin, 17 May 1794. Her father, Denis Brownell Murphy (died 1842), was a miniaturist and enamel painter. He moved to England in 1798 with his wife Johanna and four daughters (of whom Anna was the eldest) and eventually settled at Hanwell, London.

At sixteen years of age, she became governess in the family of Charles Paulet, 13th Marquess of Winchester. In 1821 she was engaged to lawyer and later Upper Canada jurist Robert Jameson. The engagement was broken off, and Anna Murphy accompanied a young pupil to Italy, writing a &quot;autobiographical&quot; narrative under the guise of an unnamed and ailing young woman who eventually dies. She gave this diary to a bookseller on condition of receiving a guitar if he secured any profits. Colburn ultimately published it as &quot;The Diary of an Ennuyée&quot; (1826), which attracted much attention, not least because the identity of the writer was soon discovered creating a scandal among reviewers in particular who felt they had been duped. For Anna however, it was the first taste of notoriety. Anna Murphy was governess to the children of Edward Littleton, later created Baron Hatherton, from 1821 to 1825, when she relented and married Jameson.

The marriage proved unhappy. In 1829, when Jameson was appointed puisne judge in the island of Dominica, he left Anna in England (never sending for her during his time there despite repeated promises), and she visited Continental Europe again with her father. In that year she made her name when the &quot;Loves of the Poets&quot; was published. The book attracted a poem by Mrs. Cornwell Baron Wilson in tribute.

The first work which displayed her powers of original thought was her &quot;Characteristics of Women: Moral, Poetical, and Historical&quot; (1832).
She used her analyses of William Shakespeare&#x27;s heroines to put forward a subtle account of female virtue. This book, which later became known as &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Heroines&quot;, was incredibly successful. Harriet Martineau remarked that &quot;Mrs Jameson&#x27;s world-wide reputation dates from the publication of this book&quot;. The book was reissued 28 times during the nineteenth century alone. As Anne Russell says, &quot;So widely was Shakspeare’s Heroines read that almost every subsequent nineteenth-century writer on Shakespeare’s women characters mentions the book&quot;.

German literature and art had aroused much interest in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and Jameson paid her first visit to the German Confederation in 1833. The conglomerations of hard lines, cold colours and pedantic subjects which decorated Munich under the patronage of King Ludwig I of Bavaria, were new to the world, and Jameson&#x27;s enthusiasm first gave them an English reputation. In 1834 she published the book &quot;Visits and Sketches at Home and Abroad&quot; about her German travels, which included many analyses of art and literature. This book was popular as well and meant that Jameson was important for importing German thought and culture into Victorian Britain.

In 1836, Jameson was summoned to Canada by her husband, who had been appointed to the Court of Chancery of the province of Upper Canada. Jameson and her husband had already lived apart for over four years, during which Anna made a good living for herself as a writer. She made no secret of the fact that she was unhappy in her marriage. Upon her arrival, her husband failed to meet her at New York and she was left to make her way alone in winter to Toronto. Here she began the travelogue of her journey, &quot;Winter Studies and Summer Rambles in Canada&quot;, which was published in Britain in 1838. She wrote in this book of her initial distaste for Toronto, describing it as &quot;ugly&quot; and &quot;inefficient.&quot; After eight months of travelling and writing in Canada, she felt it useless to prolong a life far from all ties of family happiness and opportunities for a woman of her class and education. Before leaving, she undertook a journey to the depths of the Indian settlements in Canada; she explored Lake Huron, and saw much of emigrant and indigenous life unknown to colonial travellers. She returned to Great Britain in 1838.
At this period Jameson began making careful notes of the chief private art collections in and near London. The result appeared in her &quot;Companion to the Private Galleries&quot; (1842), followed in the same year by the &quot;Handbook to the Public Galleries&quot;. She published &quot;Memoirs of the Early Italian Painters&quot; in 1845, which had previously been serialised in the Penny Magazine. That same year she visited her friend Ottilie von Goethe. Her friendship with Annabella Byron, 11th Baroness Wentworth, dates from about this time and lasted for some seven years until the two fell out. This seems to have been because Byron&#x27;s daughter Ada Lovelace confided in Jameson about her involvement in a gambling scheme and Jameson kept the secret from her mother, which emerged after Lovelace died.

A volume of essays published in 1846, &quot;Memoirs and Essays Illustrative of Art, Literature and Social Morals&quot;, contains Jameson&#x27;s important essay &quot;The House of Titian&quot;. In this she discussed how we can engage with and access art from past eras. She wrote: &quot;The real value, the real immortality of the beautiful productions of old art lies in their truth as embodying the spirit of a particular age. We have not so much outgrown that spirit, as we have comprehended it in a still larger sphere of experience and existence. We do not repudiate it; … but we carry it with us into a wider, grander horizon. It is no longer the whole, but a part, as that which is now the whole to us shall hereafter be but a part; for thus the soul of humanity spreads into a still widening circle, embracing the yet unknown, the yet unrevealed, unattained.&quot;

In 1842, Mrs. Jameson began work on what became her most successful work of all: her six-volume book series &quot;Sacred and Legendary Art&quot;. The first parts were serialised in the journal &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; from 1845-1846. The complete set of books comprised volumes 1 and 2, &quot;The poetry of Sacred and Legendary Art&quot;, which covered artistic portrayals of the angels, evangelists, apostles, church doctors, and Mary Magdalene in the first volume and the saints and martyrs in the second. Volume 3, &quot;Legends of the monastic orders&quot;, dealing with artistic portrayals of these orders, came out in 1850; and in 1852, Mrs. Jameson published volume 4, &quot;Legends of the Madonna&quot;. The last two volumes were unfinished when she died and were completed in 1864 by her friend Lady Eastlake, as &quot;The History of Our Lord in Art&quot;.

The series was very popular. The first two volumes were reissued 28 times in the nineteenth century alone; the third volume, 21 times; and the fourth, eighteen times. When she died in 1860, the New York Times said that Mrs. Jameson had &quot;done probably more than any other writer to familiarize the public mind with the principles of art; and her perception of the inner spirit of a great work was so thorough, that its mere statement was eloquence&quot;. According to William King in an encyclopedia of women&#x27;s achievements from 1902, &quot;As a writer on matters of art and taste Mrs. Jameson probably surpassed all other women writers and on the literature of art she is conceded by many to stand next to Ruskin&quot;.

She also took a keen interest in women&#x27;s education, rights, and employment. Her early essay on &quot;The Relative Social Position of Mothers and Governesses&quot; was the work of one who knew both sides; and in no respect does she more clearly prove the falseness of the position she describes than in the certainty with which she predicts its eventual reform. To her we owe the first popular enunciation of the principle of male and female co-operation in works of mercy and education. In her later years she took up a succession of subjects all bearing on the same principles of active benevolence and the best ways of carrying them into practice. Sisters of charity, hospitals, penitentiaries, prisons, and workhouses all claimed her interest – all more or less included under those definitions of &quot;the communion of love and communion of labour&quot; which are inseparably connected with her memory. To the clear and temperate forms in which she brought the results of her convictions before her friends in the shape of private lectures (published as &quot;Sisters of Charity&quot;, 1855, and &quot;The Communion of Labour&quot;, 1856) may be traced the source whence later reformers and philanthropists took counsel and courage.

<doc id="213976" wikidata="Q332997" url="?curid=213976" title="Embalming">
<text>Embalming is the art and science of preserving human remains by treating them with embalming chemicals in modern times to forestall decomposition. This is usually done to make the deceased suitable for viewing as part of the funeral ceremony or keep them preserved for medical purposes in an anatomical laboratory. The three goals of embalming are sanitization, presentation, and preservation, with restoration being an important additional factor in some instances. Performed successfully, embalming can help preserve the body for many years. Embalming has a long, cross-cultural history, with many cultures giving the embalming processes religious meaning.

Animal remains can also be embalmed by similar methods, though embalming is distinct from taxidermy. Embalming preserves the body while keeping it intact, whereas taxidermy is the recreation of an animal&#x27;s form often using only the creature&#x27;s skin, fur or feathers mounted on an anatomical form.

==History==

While the term &quot;embalming&quot; is used for both ancient and modern methods of preserving a deceased person, there is very little connection between the modern-day practices of embalming and ancient methods in terms of techniques or final aesthetic results.

The Chinchorro culture in the Atacama desert of present-day Chile and Peru is among the earliest cultures known to have performed artificial mummification, as early as 5000⁠–⁠6000 BCE. The earliest known evidence of artificial preservation in Europe was found in Osorno (Spain) – approximately 5000-year-old human bones covered in cinnabar for preservation – however embalming remained unusual in Europe up to the time of the Roman Empire.

The ancient culture that developed embalming to the greatest extent was probably Egypt. As early as the 200 BC, specialized priests were in charge of embalming and mummification. They did so by removing organs, ridding the body of moisture, and covering the body with natron, a mixture of desiccating salts found naturally in the Wadi El Natrun west of the Nile Delta. The ancient Egyptians believed that mummification enabled the soul to return to the preserved corpse after death. Other cultures known to have used embalming techniques in antiquity include the Meroites, Guanches, Peruvians, Jivaro Indians, Aztecs, Toltecs, Mayans, and Tibetan and southern Nigerian tribes.

In China, artificially preserved remains have been recovered from the period of the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), the main examples being those of Xin Zhui and the Mawangdui Han tombs site. While these remains have been extraordinarily well preserved, the embalming fluids and methods used are unknown.

In Europe the ancient practice of artificial preservation had become widespread by about 500 CE. The period of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance is known as the anatomists&#x27; period of embalming and is characterized by an increased influence of scientific developments in medicine and the need for bodies for dissection purposes. Early methods used are documented by contemporary physicians such as Peter Forestus (1522–1597) and Ambroise Pare (1510–1590). The first attempts to inject the vascular system were made by Alessandra Giliani, who died in 1326. Various attempts and procedures have been reported by Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), Jacobus Berengar (1470–1550), Bartholomeo Eustachius (1520–1574), Reinier de Graaf (1641–1673), Jan Swammerdam (1637–1680), and Frederik Ruysch (1638–1731).

===Modern methods===
The modern method of embalming involves the injection of various chemical solutions into the arterial network of the body to primarily disinfect and slow the decomposition process. William Harvey, the 17th century English physician who was the first to detail the system of blood circulation, made his discoveries by injecting colored solutions into corpses.

The Scottish surgeon William Hunter was the first to apply these methods to the art of embalming as part of mortuary practice. He wrote a widely read report on the appropriate methods for arterial and cavity embalming in order to preserve bodies for burial. His brother, John Hunter, applied these methods and advertised his embalming services to the general public from the mid-18th century.

One of his more notorious clients was dentist Martin Van Butchell. When his wife Mary died on 14 January 1775, he had her embalmed as an attraction to draw more customers. Hunter injected the body with preservatives and color additives that gave a glow to the corpse&#x27;s cheeks, replaced her eyes with glass eyes, and dressed her in a fine lace dress. The body was embedded in a layer of plaster of Paris in a glass-topped coffin. Butchell exhibited the body in the window of his home and many Londoners came to see it; however, Butchell drew criticism for the display. A rumor, possibly started by Butchell himself, claimed that his wife&#x27;s marriage certificate had specified that her husband would only have control over her estate after her death for as long as her body was kept unburied.

Interest in, and demand for, embalming grew steadily in the 19th century largely for sentimental reasons. People sometimes wished to be buried at far-off locations, which became possible with the advent of the railways, and mourners wanted the chance to pay their last respects beside the displayed body. Other motives behind embalming were prevention of disease and the wish to prepare funerals and burials, which were becoming more elaborate, without undue haste. After Lord Nelson was killed in the Battle of Trafalgar, his body was preserved in brandy and spirits of wine mixed with camphor and myrrh for over two months. At the time of his state funeral in 1805, his body was found to still be in excellent condition and completely plastic.
Alternative methods of preservation, such as ice packing or laying the body on so called &#x27;cooling boards&#x27;, gradually lost ground to the increasingly popular and effective methods of embalming. By the mid-19th century, the newly emerging profession of businessmen-undertakers – who provided funeral and burial services – began adopting embalming methods as standard.

Embalming became more common in the United States during the American Civil War, when servicemen often died far from home. The wish of families for their remains to be returned home for local burial and lengthy transport from the battlefield meant it became common in the United States.

The period from about 1861 is sometimes known as the funeral period of embalming and is marked by a separation of the fields of embalming by undertakers and embalming (anatomical wetting) for medical and scientific purposes. Dr Thomas Holmes received a commission from the Army Medical Corps to embalm the corpses of dead Union officers to return to their families. Military authorities also permitted private embalmers to work in military-controlled areas. The passage of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s body home for burial was made possible by embalming, and it brought wider public attention to the possibilities and potential of embalming.

Until the early 20th century, embalming fluids often contained arsenic until it was supplanted by more effective and less toxic chemicals. There was concern about the possibility of arsenic from embalmed bodies contaminating ground water supplies, as well as legal concerns that people suspected of murder by arsenic poisoning might claim that levels of poison in the deceased&#x27;s body were the result of post-mortem embalming, not homicide.

In 1855, the Russian chemist Alexander Michailowitsch Butlerow discovered formaldehyde, the preservative properties of which were soon noted, and it became the foundation for modern methods of embalming.

Dr Frederic Ruysch was the first to have used the arterial injection method for embalming. His work of embalming was so nearly perfect that people thought the dead body was actually alive; however, he only used it to prepare specimens for his anatomical work.

===Present day===
Modern embalming is most often performed to ensure a better presentation of the deceased for viewing by friends and relatives. It is also used for medical research or training.

A successful viewing of the body is considered to be helpful in the grieving process. Embalming has the potential to prevent mourners from having to deal with the rotting and eventual putrescence of the corpse. Despite a common misconception, embalming is not mandatory in the United States, although it is a general legal requirement for international repatriation of human remains to the U.S. (exceptions do occur).

There are no universal international preservation requirements for repatriation of human remains, but requirements for embalming do exist for a variety of countries depending on locality and circumstance. Some international standards do exist however, such as the Strasbourg Agreement of the Council of Europe, agreed to by more than 20 States in Europe, which only requires embalming in cases where the individual died due to an infectious disease.

===Jessica Mitford and the revisionist position===

The beneficial perception of the viewing of a properly embalmed deceased person has been challenged by authors such as Jessica Mitford, who points out that there is no general consensus that viewing an embalmed corpse is somehow &quot;therapeutic&quot; to the bereaved, and that terms such as &quot;memory picture&quot; were invented by the undertakers themselves, who would have a financial interest in selling the process of embalming to the public. Mitford also points out that, in many countries, embalming is rare, and the populace of such countries are still able to grieve normally.

==Terms for embalmers==

An embalmer is someone who has been trained and qualified in the art and science of sanitization, presentation, and preservation of the human deceased. The term &quot;mortician&quot; is far more generic; it may refer to someone who is a funeral director, an embalmer, or just a person who prepares the deceased, with or without the formal qualification of an embalmer. Thus while all embalmers are morticians, many morticians are not embalmers and the terms are not intrinsically synonymous.

Embalming training commonly involves formal study in anatomy, thanatology, chemistry, and specific embalming theory (to widely varied levels depending on the region of the world one lives in) combined with practical instruction in a mortuary with a resultant formal qualification granted after the passing of a final practical examination and acceptance into a recognized society of professional embalmers. The roles of a funeral director and embalmer are different, depending on the locals custom and licensing body for a region in which the funeral director and/or embalmer operate. A funeral director arranges for the final disposition of the deceased, and may or may not prepare the deceased, including embalming, for viewing (or other legal requirements).

Legal requirements over who can practice vary geographically. Some regions or countries do not have specific requirements, while others have clear prohibitions. In the United States, the title of an embalmer is largely based on the state in which they are licensed. Additionally, in many places, embalming is not done by specialist embalmers, but rather by doctors, medical technicians or laboratory technicians who, while they have the required anatomical or chemical knowledge, are not trained specialists in this field. Today, embalming is a common practice in North America, Australia, New Zealand, Britain and Ireland, while it is much less frequent in many parts of Europe; most modern countries have embalming available in some manner.

==Modern practices==
As practiced in the funeral home, embalming involves several distinct steps. Modern embalming techniques are not the result of a single practitioner, but rather the accumulation of many decades, even centuries, of research, trial and error, and invention. A standardized version follows below, but variation in techniques are common.

The first step in embalming is to verify the permissions and requests of the family followed by a careful plan for the deceased&#x27;s preparation, including reviewing the medical certificate of death. The deceased is placed on the mortuary table in the supine anatomical position with the head elevated by a head rest. Before commencing any preparation the embalmer will verify the identity of the body (normally via wrist or leg bracelets or tags). At this point, embalmers commonly perform an initial evaluation of the deceased&#x27;s condition, noting things such as rigor mortis, skin condition, edema, intravenous injection sites, presence of fecal matter, tissue gas and numerous other factors which may affect the procedure and outcome. The embalming procedure is a surgical one, albeit rather minimally invasive. The process requires significant effort over the course of multiple hours, including intensive planning, evaluation, and chemical selection.

Any clothing on the body is removed and set aside, and any personal effects such as jewelry are inventoried. A modesty cloth is commonly placed over the genitalia. The body is washed in a germicidal soap. During this process the embalmer bends, flexes, and massages the arms and legs to relieve rigor mortis. The eyes are posed using an eye cap that keeps them shut and in the proper expression. The mouth may be closed via suturing with a needle and ligature, using an adhesive, or by setting a wire into the maxilla and mandible with a needle injector, a specialized device most commonly used in North America and unique to mortuary practice. Care is taken to make the expression look as relaxed and natural as possible, and ideally, a recent photograph of the deceased in good health is used as a reference. The process of closing the mouth and eyes, shaving, etc. is collectively known as setting the features. Features may also be set after the completion of the arterial embalming process, which allows the embalmer to clean and remove any purge that occurs during the embalming process.
The actual embalming process usually involves four parts:

#Arterial embalming, which involves the injection of embalming chemicals into the blood vessels, usually via the right common carotid artery. Blood and interstitial fluids are displaced by this injection and, along with excess arterial solution, are expelled from the right jugular vein and collectively referred to as drainage. The embalming solution is injected with a centrifugal pump, and the embalmer massages the body to break up circulatory clots so as to ensure the proper distribution of the embalming fluid. This process of raising vessels with injection and drainage from a solitary location is known as a single-point injection. In cases of poor circulation of the arterial solution, additional injection points (commonly the axillary, brachial, or femoral arteries, with the ulnar, radial, and tibial vessels if necessary) are used. The corresponding veins are commonly also raised and utilized for drainage. Cases where more than one vessel is raised are referred to as multiple-point injection, with a reference to the number of vessels raised (i.e. a six-point injection or six-pointer). As a general rule, the more points needing to be raised, the greater the difficulty of the case. In some cases draining from a different site from injection (i.e. injecting arterial fluid into the right common carotid artery and draining from the right femoral vein) is referred to as a split (or sometimes cut) injection. In certain cases the embalmer may deem it necessary to perform a restricted cervical injection, which involves injecting the head of the deceased separately from the rest of body. This is done in cases where distention (swelling) has a greater chance of occurring. In many cases, an embalmer may select to perform what is known as a pre-injection. A pre-injection is a solution of chemicals that do not contain any preservative chemicals, but rather chemicals that encourage vasodilation, help disperse blood clots, and act as chelating agents. The focus of this &quot;pre-injection&quot; is to allow for a more complete drainage and better distribution of the arterial embalming solution.
#Cavity treatment/embalming refers to the removal of internal fluids inside body cavities via the use of an aspirator and trocar. The embalmer makes a small incision just above the navel (two inches superior and two inches to the right) and pushes the trocar into the abdominal and chest cavities. This first punctures the hollow organs and aspirates their contents. The embalmer then fills the cavities with concentrated chemicals (known as cavity chemicals) that may contain formaldehyde, which are delivered to the chest cavity via the trocar inserted through the diaphragm. The incision is either sutured closed (commonly using the purse-string or &#x27;N&#x27; suture methods) or a &quot;trocar button&quot; is secured into place.
#Hypodermic embalming is a supplemental method which refers to the injection of embalming chemicals into tissue with a hypodermic needle and syringe, which is generally used as needed on a case-by-case basis to treat areas where arterial fluid has not been successfully distributed during the main arterial injection.
#Surface embalming, another supplemental method, utilizes embalming chemicals to preserve and restore areas directly on the skin&#x27;s surface and other superficial areas as well as areas of damage such as from accident, decomposition, cancerous growths, or skin donation.

The duration of an embalming can vary greatly, but a common approximate time of between two and four hours to complete an embalming is typical. However, an embalming case that presents excessive complications could require substantially longer. The treatment of someone who has undergone an autopsy, cases of extreme trauma, or the restoration of a long-bone donor are a few such examples, and some embalmings may take several days to complete.

Embalming is meant to temporarily preserve the body of a deceased person. Regardless of whether embalming is performed, the type of burial or entombment, and the materials used – such as wood or metal coffins and vaults – the body of the deceased will, under most circumstances, eventually decompose. Modern embalming is done to delay decomposition so that funeral services may take place or for the purpose of shipping the remains to a distant place for disposition.

==Grooming==

Every case is different, and different embalming professionals work in different ways. Common grooming practices may include combing and styling the hair and applying cream or emollient spray to the skin to maintain hydration. The deceased will then be dressed and makeup may be applied to mimic natural coloring or the deceased person&#x27;s typical styling. Hair gel or baby oil is applied to style short hair; while hairspray is applied to style long hair. Powders (especially baby powder) are applied to the body to eliminate odors, and it is also applied to the face to achieve a matte and fresh effect to prevent oiliness of the corpse. Makeup techniques may include using an airbrush to evenly apply product, using mascara to add volume to eyelashes, filling in eyebrows with pencil, and using lipstick or gloss to add color to the lips. Mortuary cosmeticizing is not done for the same reason as make-up for living people; rather, it is designed to add depth and dimension to a person&#x27;s features that lack of blood circulation has removed. Warm areas – where blood vessels in living people are superficial, such as the cheeks, chin, and knuckles – have subtle reds added to recreate this effect, while browns are added to the palpebrae (eyelids) to add depth, especially important as viewing in a coffin creates an unusual perspective rarely seen in everyday life. During the viewing, pink-colored lighting is sometimes used near the body to lend a warmer tone to the deceased&#x27;s complexion.

A photograph of the deceased in good health is often sought to guide the embalmer&#x27;s hand in restoring the body to a more lifelike appearance. Blemishes and discolorations (such as bruises, in which the discoloration is not in the circulatory system, and cannot be removed by arterial injection) occasioned by the last illness, the settling of blood, or the embalming process itself are also dealt with at this time (although some embalmers utilize hypodermic bleaching agents, such as phenol-based cauterants, during injection to lighten discoloration and allow easier cosmeticizing). It is also common for the embalmer to perform minor restoration of the deceased&#x27;s appearance with tissue building chemicals and a hypodermic syringe. Tissue building chemicals (Tissue Builders) become solid with the introduction of liquids such as water or interstitial fluids. Commonly the area where the sphenoid and temporal bones meet; this can also be referred to the temples. In the event of trauma or natural depressions on the face or hands, tissue builder can also be utilised to return those regions of the face to the expectations of the family.

==Clothing==

As with all funeral practises local custom, culture, religion and family request are the key determiners of clothing for the deceased. In the Western world, men are usually buried in business attire, such as a suit or coat and tie, and women in semi-formal dresses or pant suits. In recent years, a change has occurred, and many individuals are now buried in less formal clothing, such as what they would have worn on a daily basis, or other favorite attire. The clothing used can also reflect the deceased person&#x27;s profession or vocation: priests and ministers are often dressed in their liturgical vestments, and military and law enforcement personnel often wear their uniform. Underwear, singlets, bras, briefs, and hosiery are all used if the family so desires, and the deceased is dressed in them as they would be in life.

In certain instances a funeral director will request a specific style of clothing, such as a collared shirt or blouse, to cover traumatic marks or autopsy incisions. In other cases clothing may be cut down the back and placed on the deceased from the front to ensure a proper fit. In many areas of Asia and Europe, the custom of dressing the body in a specially designed shroud or burial cloth, rather than in clothing used by the living, is preferred.

After the deceased has been dressed, they are generally placed in their coffin or casket. In American English, the word &quot;coffin&quot; is used to refer to an anthropoid (stretched hexagonal) form, whereas &quot;casket&quot; refers specifically to a rectangular coffin. It is common for photographs, notes, cards, and favourite personal items to be placed in the coffin with the deceased. Bulky and expensive items, such as electric guitars, are occasionally interred with a body. In some ways this mirrors the ancient practice of placing grave goods with a person for their use or enjoyment in the afterlife. In traditional Chinese culture, paper substitutes of the goods are buried or cremated with the deceased instead, as well as paper money specifically purchased for the occasion.

==Chemicals==
Embalming chemicals are a variety of preservatives, sanitizers, disinfectant agents, and additives used in modern embalming to temporarily delay decomposition and restore a natural appearance for viewing a body after death. A mixture of these chemicals is known as embalming fluid, and is used to preserve deceased individuals, sometimes only until the funeral, other times indefinitely.

Typical embalming fluid contains a mixture of formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, methanol, humectants and wetting agents, and other solvents that can be used. The formaldehyde content generally ranges from 5–35%, and the methanol content may range from 9–56%.

Environmentalists sometimes have concerns about embalming because of the harmful chemicals involved and their potential interactions with the environment. Recently, more eco-friendly embalming methods have become available, including formaldehyde-free mixtures of chemicals.

==Specialist embalming==

Badly decomposing bodies, trauma cases, frozen, or drowned bodies, and those to be transported over long distances also require special treatment beyond that for the &quot;normal&quot; case. The restoration of bodies and features damaged by accident or disease is commonly called restorative art or demisurgery, and all qualified embalmers have some degree of training and practice in it. For such cases, the benefit of embalming is startlingly apparent. Normally, a better result can be achieved when a photograph and the decedent&#x27;s regular make-up (if worn) are available to help make the deceased appear more as they did when alive.

Embalming autopsy cases differs from standard embalming because the nature of the post-mortem examination irrevocably disrupts the circulatory system, due to the removal of the organs and viscera. In these cases, a six-point injection is made through the two iliac or femoral arteries, subclavian or axillary vessels, and common carotids, with the viscera treated separately with cavity fluid or a special embalming powder in a viscera bag.

Long-term preservation requires different techniques, such as using stronger preservatives and multiple injection sites to ensure thorough saturation of body tissues.

==For anatomy education==

A rather different process is used for cadavers embalmed for dissection by medical professionals, students, and researchers. Here, the first priority is for long-term preservation, not presentation. As such, medical embalmers use anatomical wetting fluids that contain concentrated formaldehyde (37–40%, known as formalin) or glutaraldehyde and phenol, and are made without dyes or perfumes. Many embalming chemical companies make specialized anatomical embalming fluids.

Anatomical embalming is performed into a closed circulatory system. The fluid is usually injected with an embalming machine into an artery under high pressure and flow, and allowed to swell and saturate the tissues. After the deceased is left to sit for a number of hours, the venous system is generally opened and the fluid allowed to drain out, although many anatomical embalmers do not use any drainage technique.

Anatomical embalmers may choose to use gravity-feed embalming, where the container dispensing the embalming fluid is elevated above the body&#x27;s level, and fluid is slowly introduced over an extended time, sometimes as long as several days. Unlike standard arterial embalming, no drainage occurs, and the body distends extensively with fluid. The distension eventually reduces, often under extended (up to six months) refrigeration, leaving a fairly normal appearance. No separate cavity treatment of the internal organs is given. Anatomically embalmed cadavers have a typically uniform grey colouration, due both to the high formaldehyde concentration mixed with the blood and the lack of red colouration agents commonly added to standard, nonmedical, embalming fluids. Formaldehyde mixed with blood causes the grey discoloration also known as &quot;formaldehyde grey&quot; or &quot;embalmer&#x27;s grey&quot;.

A new embalming technique developed gradually since the 1960s by anatomist Walter Thiel at the Graz Anatomy Institute in Austria has been the subject of various academic papers, as the cadaver retains the body&#x27;s natural color, texture and plasticity after the process. The method uses 4-chloro-3-methylphenol and various salts for fixation, boric acid for disinfection, and ethylene glycol for the preservation of tissue plasticity. Thiel embalmed cadavers are used in anatomical research, surgical and anaesthesia training, preoperative test procedures, CT image quality studies.

==Religious practices==
Opinions differ among different faiths as to the permissibility of embalming. A brief overview of some of the larger faiths’ positions is as follows:
*Most branches and denominations of the Christian faith allow embalming. Some bodies within Eastern Orthodoxy and Lutheranism profess an absolute ban on embalming except when required by law or other necessity, while others may discourage but do not prohibit it. In most Christian denominations, the decision on embalming is the preference of the deceased&#x27;s family rather than for church policy or theological viewpoint.
*The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints does not discourage or prohibit embalming. Often, due to the custom of church members dressing the deceased, embalming is given preference.
*Some Neopagans discourage embalming, believing it unnatural to disrupt the physical recycling of the body to the Earth. 
*Members of the Bahá&#x27;í Faith are not embalmed. Instead, the body is washed and then placed in a cotton, linen, or silk shroud. 
*Zoroastrians traditionally hold a type of sky burial within a structure known as a Tower of Silence in which the body is exposed to weathering and predation to dispose of the remains. Embalming the body is thus contrary to their funeral designs.
*Traditional Jewish law forbids embalming. Burial is to be done as soon as possible; preferably within 24 hours.
*Embalming is not practiced in Hinduism. The body is usually cremated as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours, except when the offspring of the deceased need time to get to the location (in which case the body is refrigerated).
*In Islam, embalming of the dead is not practiced, except in cases of necessity, such as when a body is being transported internationally and the law requires it to be embalmed. Muslims bury their deceased without delay (preferably within 24 hours), to allow the soul to transition to the afterlife as soon as possible.

==Notable embalmings==

*Lord Nelson (1758–1805) was preserved for two months in brandy and spirits of wine mixed with camphor and myrrh after which time the body was found to be in excellent condition and completely plastic.
*Various communist leaders have been embalmed and put on public display. Perhaps the most famous embalmed body of the 20th century is that of Vladimir Lenin, which continues to draw crowds decades after his death in 1924, and is seen in his Moscow mausoleum. Joseph Stalin was also embalmed and placed next to Lenin, but his body was buried in 1961 during de-Stalinization. Klement Gottwald of Czechoslovakia, who died just five days after attending Stalin&#x27;s funeral, was embalmed and displayed in a mausoleum at National Monument in Vitkov in Prague. However, in 1962 due to political reasons, the body was removed and cremated. Bulgarian Georgi Dimitrov was embalmed and placed on display in the Sofia Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum. After the fall of Communism in Bulgaria, his body was buried in 1990 in the Central cemetery of Sofia. Mongolia&#x27;s Khorloogiin Choibalsan, Angola&#x27;s Agostinho Neto, Romania&#x27;s Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and Guyana&#x27;s Forbes Burnham were also embalmed by the same Russian team. Currently, embalmed communist leaders can also be found in the Mausoleum of Mao Zedong, the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, and the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun for Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il.

*The botched embalming of Pope Pius XII (1876–1958; pope 1939–1958) by a charlatan doctor – which only sped up the rate of decomposition – led to his body turning black and his nose falling off while lying in state, and the body disintegrated in the coffin. The Swiss Guards stationed around Pius XII&#x27;s body were forced to change shifts every 10 to 15 minutes, since the body&#x27;s odor caused some guards to pass out. The doctor who performed the embalming had also taken photos of the pontiff in his death throes, intending to sell them to tabloids. The Italian tabloids refused to buy the photos, and the doctor was banned from entering the Vatican City-State by John XXIII, who furthermore prohibited any photography of a deceased pope until the body is properly vested and laid out.
*Charles XII (1682–1718) is one of several Swedish kings to have been embalmed. When Charles XII&#x27;s sarcophagus was opened in 1917, his features were still recognizable, almost 200 years after his death. Photographs of his remains clearly show the gunshot wound to his head leading to his death.
*The body of Pope John XXIII (1881–1963; pope 1958–1963) is on display on an altar on the main floor of the Basilica of Saint Peter after having been exhumed from the grottoes beneath the main altar and has retained an extremely well-preserved state. If a body&#x27;s remains do not decompose, contrary to expectations, it is often treated as a miracle. However, the case of John XXIII&#x27;s body did not enjoy the same acclamation, as it was held to have been due to embalming and adipocere formation.
*The body of Pope Pius X (1835–1914; pope 1903–1914) lies in a crystal coffin, in the Chapel of the Presentation of the Virgin Mary. On 17 February 1952, Pius X&#x27;s body was transferred from the crypt of the Vatican grotto. The body is dressed in pontifical robes, while the face and hands are covered with silver. He lies within a glass and bronze-work sarcophagus for the faithful to see. Papal physicians had been in the habit of removing organs to aid the embalming process. Pius X expressly prohibited this, however, and none of his successors has allowed the practice to be reinstituted.
*Murdered civil rights activist Medgar Evers was so well embalmed that a valid autopsy was able to be performed on his corpse decades after his death, and this helped secure the conviction of his killer.

*Famous Russian surgeon and scientist N. I. Pirogov was embalmed after his death in 1881. He was embalmed using the technique he himself developed. His body rests in a church in Vinnitsa, Ukraine. In contrast to the corpse of Lenin, which undergoes thorough maintenance in a special underground clinic twice a week, the body of Pirogov rests untouched and unchanging – reportedly only dust has to be brushed off of it. It rests at room temperature in a glass-lid coffin (while Lenin&#x27;s body is preserved at a constant low temperature).
*Abraham Lincoln was embalmed after his assassination in 1865. To prevent anyone stealing Lincoln&#x27;s body, Lincoln&#x27;s eldest son Robert called for Lincoln&#x27;s exhumation in 1901 to be buried in a concrete vault in the burial room of his tomb in Springfield, Illinois. Fearing that his body would have been stolen in the interim, Lincoln&#x27;s coffin was opened, and his features were still recognizable, 36 years after his death.
*Rosalia Lombardo, who died at age one on 6 December 1920, was one of the last corpses to be interred in the Capuchin catacombs of Palermo, Sicily before the local authorities banned the practice. Nicknamed the &#x27;Sleeping Beauty&#x27;, Rosalia&#x27;s body is still perfectly intact. Embalmed by Alfredo Salafia, she is in a glass case, looking very much like a surreal doll.
*Eva Perón was embalmed by Dr. Pedro Ara, as ordered by her husband Juan Perón. The body was preserved to look like it was in a sleep-like state. The procedure worked and the body showed no signs of decomposition when Eva was interred at her final resting place many years after the initial procedure.
*Kemal Atatürk was embalmed. His remains were originally laid to rest in the Ethnography Museum of Ankara from 10 November 1938 to 10 November 1953. He was subsequently moved to Anıtkabir in Ankara, Turkey, buried in a 42-ton sarcophagus.
*Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo were embalmed and rest at Cihu Mausoleum and Touliao Mausoleum in Daxi District, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.
*Francisco Franco was embalmed. His remains were originally laid to rest in the Valley of the Fallen from 1975 to 2019. He was subsequently moved to Mingorrubio Cemetery, El Pardo, Madrid, Spain.
*Ferdinand Marcos was embalmed in Hawaii upon his death. His body was flown home and is on display at Marcos Museum and Mausoleum in Batac, Ilocos Norte, Philippines from 1993 to 18 November 2016.
*Diana, Princess of Wales was embalmed shortly after her death in France in August 1997. The decision to embalm her provoked conspiracy theories that she was pregnant; conspiracists claimed, incorrectly, that the embalming fluid would have destroyed any evidence of fetal presence in her womb. The official explanation for the embalming was that the warm conditions in the chapel of rest where her body was laid out would have sped up the decomposition of the remains.
*When the Basilica of Saint-Denis was desecrated by French revolutionaries in 1793, the body of Henry IV was so well preserved it was displayed two days before being thrown in a mass grave, and a new death mask was able to be made. Likewise, Louis XIII was still recognisable thanks to his well preserved moustache. Turenne was so well preserved that looters first thought he was still alive.
*Maria II of Portugal died in childbirth on 15 November 1853 at the age of 34. She was embalmed the following day. In a letter dated 28 November 1853, the Duchess of Ficalho, the queen&#x27;s lady-in-waiting, reported the outcome to her brother, the 2nd Count of Lavradio:

*Between February and September 2012, researchers at the University of São Paulo in Brazil exhumed the remains of Emperor Pedro I of Brazil (also King of Portugal as Pedro IV; 1798–1834) and his two wives Empress Maria Leopoldina (1797–1826) and Empress Amélie (1812–1873). They were surprised to find that the body of the latter had been mummified. Skin, hair and internal organs were preserved. Examinations at the Hospital das Clínicas found an incision in the empress&#x27; jugular vein. Aromatics such as camphor and myrrh were injected into the incision during the embalming process. &quot;It certainly helped to nullify the decomposition&quot;, said Brazilian forensic archaeologist Valdirene Ambiel, responsible for the research. She added that another contributing factor was the casket, saying it was so hermetically sealed that there were no micro-organisms in it. Before the reinterment, scientists reembalmed Amélie&#x27;s mummified body using a method similar to the first one.

*Pedro II of Brazil died from pneumonia during his exile in France in 1891 at the age of 66. He was embalmed on 5 December, the day of his death. During the process, six liters (1.585 gallons) of hydrochloride of zinc and aluminum was injected into his common carotid artery. Three coffins were used: an inner lead-lined coffin, which contained the body, and two outer coffins. According to Julie Anne Taddeo, a research professor of history at the University of Maryland, lead helps keep out moisture and preserve the body for longer and prevent smells and toxins from a dead body escaping. Pedro II was interred in the Royal Pantheon of the House of Braganza in Lisbon, Portugal on 12 December 1891. The site had become a place of pilgrimage for Brazilians arriving in the country at the time. Many people used to visit it late at night only to find the place dark. With candles given to them by a local guard, they went to the emperor&#x27;s glass-topped coffin in order to see the embalmed monarch and accidentally spilled wax on the flag of the Empire of Brazil that covered it. In the 1910s, Brazilian educator and archivist went to Europe as a scholarship student to search for historical documents about Brazil. In 1912, he visited the Royal Pantheon. At the occasion, he had noticed the well-preserved state of Pedro II&#x27;s body, in the same way as when he was placed in the coffin, along with the clothes which he was interred in (the court dress military uniform; the collar of the Order of the Rose; and a silver crucifix sent by Pope Leo XIII in his hands), although he did find the embalming left a lot to be desired. He wrote:

Pedro II&#x27;s remains, as well as those of his wife Teresa Cristina, were returned to Brazil in 1921. The emperor and empress are interred in the Cathedral of Saint Peter of Alcantara in Petrópolis, a city founded by Pedro II himself.

<doc id="213978" wikidata="Q1275943" url="?curid=213978" title="George Henry Lewes">
<text>George Henry Lewes (; 18 April 1817 – 30 November 1878) was an English philosopher and critic of literature and theatre. He was also an amateur physiologist. American feminist Margaret Fuller called Lewes a &quot;witty, French, flippant sort of man&quot;. He became part of the mid-Victorian ferment of ideas which encouraged discussion of Darwinism, positivism, and religious skepticism. However, he is perhaps best known today for having openly lived with Mary Ann Evans, who wrote under the pen name George Eliot, as soulmates whose lives and writings were enriched by their relationship, though they never married each other.

==Personal life==
===Early life===
Lewes, born in London, was the illegitimate son of the minor poet John Lee Lewes and Elizabeth Ashweek, and the grandson of comic actor Charles Lee Lewes. His mother married a retired sea captain when he was six. Frequent changes of home meant he was educated in London, Jersey, and Brittany and finally at Dr Charles Burney&#x27;s school in Greenwich. Having abandoned successively a commercial and a medical career, he seriously thought of becoming an actor and appeared several times on stage between 1841 and 1850. Finally he devoted himself to literature, science and philosophy.

As early as 1836, he belonged to a club formed for the study of philosophy, and had sketched out a physiological treatment of the philosophy of the Scottish school. Two years later he went to Germany, probably with the intention of studying philosophy.

Lewes undertook studies on nutrition and physiology; he explored the question whether sugar was injurious to teeth. He conducted experiments on the reflexes and the nervous system of living animals, especially frogs, using ether and chloroform out of consideration for their pain.

He became friends with Leigh Hunt, and through him he entered London literary society and met John Stuart Mill, Thomas Carlyle and Charles Dickens.

===Marriage to Agnes Jervis===
On 18 February 1841, Lewes married 19-year-old Agnes Jervis, daughter of Swynfen Stevens Jervis, who gave written permission for the marriage and witnessed the wedding. There are several theories about how they met, such as Lewes working for Swynfen Jervis as a secretary or tutor for his sons. They may have met through Thornton Hunt&#x27;s circle of friends. Jervis was young, and considered &quot;lovely&quot;, &quot;charming&quot;, and intelligent. She took positions as a translator to augment the family&#x27;s income.

The couple lived in Kensington in the houses of Lewes&#x27;s mother and others. Lewes and Agnes Jervis agreed to have an open marriage. Between 1842 and 1848, Lewes and his wife had four sons together, Charles Lee, Thornton Arnott, Herbert Arthur, and St Vincent Arthy. Agnes also had four children by Lewes&#x27;s best friend (Thornton Hunt), the son of Leigh Hunt. Because Lewes was named on the birth certificate as the father of one of these children despite knowing this to be false, he was considered complicit in adultery and was not able to divorce Agnes. Lewes left his wife in 1854 to live with Mary Ann Evans.

Of his sons only one, Charles (1843–1891), survived him. He was elected as the first London County Councillor (1888) for St Pancras. He was also much interested in the Hampstead Heath extension. Charles married Gertrude Hill, granddaughter of Thomas Southwood Smith and sister of the social reformers Miranda Hill and Octavia Hill, the latter of whom jointly founded the National Trust.

===Relationship with Mary Ann Evans===
Lewes met writer Mary Ann Evans, later to be famous as George Eliot, in 1851, and by 1854 they had decided to live together. As a result, the couple lived with scandal for some time and Evans&#x27; family spurned them. They lived together as husband and wife, although never married, for 25 years. Lewes died in 1878. In about two years, she had married John Cross and after seven months of marriage she died suddenly in December 1880. She was buried next to Lewes at Highgate Cemetery.

==Literature==
From 1840 to 1850, Lewes supported himself by contributing to quarterly and other reviews, articles discussing a wide range of subjects, often imperfect but revealing acute critical judgment enlightened by philosophic study. The most valuable are those on drama, afterwards republished under the title &quot;Actors and Acting&quot; (1875), and &quot;The Spanish Drama&quot; (1846).

In 1845–46, Lewes published &quot;The Biographical History of Philosophy&quot;, an attempt to depict the life of philosophers as an ever-renewed fruitless labour to attain the unattainable. In 1847–48, he published two novels – &quot;Ranthorpe&quot;, and &quot;Rose, Blanche and Violet&quot; – which, though displaying considerable skill in plot, construction, and characterisation, have taken no permanent place in literature. The same is to be said of an ingenious attempt to rehabilitate &quot;Robespierre&quot; (1849). In 1850, he collaborated with Thornton Leigh Hunt in the foundation of &quot;The Leader&quot;, of which he was the literary editor. In 1853, he republished under the title of &quot;Comte&#x27;s Philosophy of the Sciences&quot; a series of papers which had appeared in that journal.

The culmination of Lewes&#x27;s work in prose literature is the &quot;Life of Goethe&quot; (1855), probably the best known of his writings. Lewes&#x27;s versatility, and his combination of scientific with literary tastes, eminently fitted him to appreciate the wide-ranging activity of the German poet. The work became well known in Germany itself, despite the boldness of its criticism and the unpopularity of some of its views (e.g. on the relation of the second to the first part of &quot;Faust&quot;).

===Science===
From about 1853, Lewes&#x27;s writings show that he was occupying himself with scientific and more particularly biological work. He always showed a distinctly scientific bent in his writings, though he had not had technical training. More than popular expositions of accepted scientific truths, they contain able criticisms of conventionally accepted ideas and embody the results of individual research and individual reflection. He made several suggestions, some of which have since been accepted by physiologists, of which the most valuable is that now known as the doctrine of the functional indifference of the nerves – that what were known as the specific energies of the optic, auditory and other nerves are simply differences in their mode of action due to the differences of the peripheral structures or sense-organs with which they are connected. This idea was subsequently proposed independently by Wundt.

===Philosophy===

In 1865, when &quot;The Fortnightly Review&quot; began publication, Lewes became its editor, but he retained the post for less than two years, when he was succeeded by John Morley.

This marks the transition from more strictly scientific to philosophic work. Lewes had been interested in philosophy from early youth; one of his earliest essays was an appreciative account of Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Aesthetics&quot;. Under the influence of the positivism of Auguste Comte and John Stuart Mill&#x27;s &quot;A System of Logic&quot;, he abandoned all faith in the possibility of metaphysics, and recorded this abandonment in his &quot;History of Philosophy&quot;. Yet he did not at any time give unqualified assent to Comte&#x27;s teachings, and with wider reading and reflection his mind moved further away from the positivist stance. In the preface to the third edition of his &quot;History of Philosophy&quot; he avowed a change in this direction, and this movement is even more plainly discernible in subsequent editions of the work.

The outcome of his intellectual progress is &quot;The Problems of Life and Mind&quot;. His sudden death cut short the work, yet it is complete enough to allow a judgment on the author&#x27;s matured conceptions on biological, psychological and metaphysical problems.

The first two volumes on &quot;The Foundations of a Creed&quot; laid down Lewes&#x27;s foundation – a &quot;rapprochement&quot; between metaphysics and science. He was still positivist enough to pronounce all inquiry into the ultimate nature of things fruitless: what matter, form, and spirit are in themselves is a futile question that belongs to the sterile region of &quot;metempirics&quot;. But philosophical questions may be susceptible to a precise solution through scientific method. Thus, since the relation of subject to object falls within our experience, it is a proper matter for philosophic investigation.

His treatment of the question of the relation of subject to object confused the scientific truth that mind and body coexist in the living organism and the philosophic truth that all knowledge of objects implies a knowing subject. In Shadworth Hodgson&#x27;s phrase, he mixed up the genesis of mental forms with their nature (see &quot;Philosophy of Reflexion&quot;, ii. 40–58). Thus he reached a monistic doctrine that mind and matter are two aspects of the same existence by attending simply to the parallelism between psychical and physical processes as a given fact (or probable fact) of our experience, leaving out of account their relation as subject and object in the cognitive act.

His identification of the two as phases of one existence is open to criticism not only from the point of view of philosophy but from that of science. In his treatment of such ideas as &quot;sensibility&quot;, &quot;sentience&quot; and the like, he does not always make it clear whether he is speaking of physical or of psychical phenomena. Among other philosophic questions discussed in these two volumes the nature of causal relation is perhaps the one which is handled with most freshness and suggestiveness.

The third volume, &quot;The Physical Basis of Mind&quot;, further develops the writer&#x27;s views on organic activities as a whole. He insists on the radical distinction between organic and inorganic processes and the impossibility of explaining the former by purely mechanical principles. All parts of the nervous system have the same elementary property; sensibility. Thus sensibility belongs as much to the lower centres of the spinal cord as to the brain, the former, more elementary, form contributing to the subconscious region of mental life, while the higher functions of the nervous system, which make up our conscious mental life, are more complex modifications of this fundamental property of nerve substance.

The nervous organism acts as a whole, particular mental operations cannot be referred to definite regions of the brain, and the hypothesis of nervous activity by an isolated pathway from one nerve cell to another is altogether illusory. By insisting on the complete coincidence between the regions of nerve action and sentience, that these are but different aspects of one thing, he was able to attack the doctrine of animal and human automatism which affirms that feeling or consciousness is merely an incidental concomitant of nerve action in no way essential to the chain of physical events.

Lewes&#x27;s views on psychology, partly explained in the earlier volumes of the &quot;Problems&quot;, are more fully worked out in the last two (3rd series). He discussed the method of psychology with much insight. Against Comte and his followers he claimed a place for introspection in psychological research. As well as this subjective method there must be an objective one, a reference to nervous conditions and socio-historical data. Biology would help explain mental functions such as feeling and thinking, it would not help us to understand differences of mental faculty in different races and stages of human development. The organic conditions of these differences will probably for ever escape detection, hence they can be explained only as the products of the social environment. The relationship of mental phenomena to social and historical conditions is probably Lewes&#x27;s most important contribution to psychology.

He also emphasised the complexity of mental phenomena. Every mental state is regarded as compounded of three factors in different proportions – sensible affection, logical grouping and motor impulse. But Lewes&#x27;s work in psychology consists less in discoveries than in method. His biological experience prepared him to view mind as a complex unity of which the highest processes are identical with and evolved out of the lower. Thus the operation of thought, or &quot;the logic of signs&quot;, is a more complicated form of the elementary operations of sensation and instinct or &quot;the logic of feeling&quot;.

The last volume of the &quot;Problems&quot; illustrates this position. It is a valuable repository of psychological facts, many of them drawn from obscure regions of mental life and from abnormal experience. To suggest and to stimulate the mind, rather than to supply it with any complete system of knowledge, may be said to be Lewes&#x27;s service to philosophy. The exceptional rapidity and versatility of his intelligence seems to account at once for the freshness in his way of envisaging the subject matter of philosophy and psychology, and for the want of satisfactory elaboration and of systematic coordination.

==Death==

Lewes died on the 30 November 1878 and is buried on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery, beside the grave of his common-law wife Mary Ann Evans, penname George Eliot.

<text>Henry Boehm (June 8, 1775 – December 28, 1875) was an American clergyman and pastor. The son of noted clergyman Martin Boehm, Henry preferred to be a traveling preacher, going to different churches and lecturing about various religious topics.

Boehm established many Methodist churches and ministerial services throughout the United States, but the first Methodist church was located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. This is where Henry Boehm preached for over seventy years. His centennial was held in high regard throughout the small villages and cities where Boehm had visited.

Boehm preached his last sermon a few days before his death at age 100 in 1875.

<text>Eucosmodontidae is a poorly preserved family of fossil mammals within the extinct order Multituberculata. Representatives are known from strata dating from the Upper Cretaceous through the Lower Eocene of North America, as well as the Paleocene to Eocene of Europe. The family is part of the suborder of Cimolodonta. They might be related with the Djadochtatherioidea but without further finds, this remains unclear. Other than a partial snout, fossil evidence is limited to teeth. A 2021 study vindicates this relationship.

The taxonomic name Eucosmodontidae was given by Jepsen in 1940. Some authors interpret this version of Eucosmodontidae and Microcosmodontidae as being subfamilies rather than families.

<text>Jean-Jacques Lefranc (also Le Franc), Marquis de Pompignan (10 August 1709 – 1 November 1784) was a French man of letters and erudition, who published a considerable output of theatrical work, poems, literary criticism, and polemics; treatises on archeology, nature, travel and many other subjects; and a wide selection of highly regarded translations of the classics and other works from several European languages including English.

His life and career, as well as his literary and other works are noteworthy today because of their location at the very center of the French Enlightenment; and although some of the positions he took are also considered to have been formative contributions to the counter-Enlightenment tendencies that were being articulated in parallel, he remains, in many respects, the typical Enlightenment man.

The prolific volumes of literary works are now of academic interest only, mainly to flesh out aspects of the culture of the time, which embraced a period in which tensions that were to explode in the French Revolution five years after his death were still held in check. Lefranc is remembered today, if he is at all, as a consequence of the maiden speech he gave at the Académie française in 1760, which led to him becoming forever known and defined as &quot;the enemy of Voltaire&quot;.

His library of some 25,000 volumes was sold after his death by his son, and became founding collections for no less than three learned institutions in Toulouse. He built a neo-classical chateau at Pompignan, and over a period of thirty-five years created one of the earliest and most extensive &quot;parcs à fabriques&quot; (or French landscape garden).

The chateau stands in good order today, and although the park and its follies have been neglected, the extensive hydrological system still functions. In May 2011 the decision was taken to route the planned Bordeaux-Toulouse TGV and high-speed freight rail lines through the center of Lefranc&#x27;s landscape park.

==Biography==

The Lefranc family were originally landlords of the Château de Cayx (or see Château de Caïx on French Wiki, which gives more detail), overlooking a bend on the Lot some 12 km northwest of Cahors. Successive Lefrancs had served since 1640 as hereditary presidents of the regional &quot;Cours des Aides&quot;, which was located in Cahors. When Louis XIV ordered the court to be moved to Montauban (some 60 km south of Cahors over difficult roads), during the presidency of Jacques Lefranc in the early years of the 18th century, the family built a town house in Montauban as their local residence. It still stands impressively today at 10 rue Armand Cambon (there is a Place Lefranc de Pompignan nearby). At the same time, lands were purchased at Pompignan (some 20 km to the southwest of Montauban) to provide a convenient rural retreat.

Jean-Jacques&#x27; father, Jacques Lefranc, was the third of the name to become president of the &quot;Cour des Aides&quot;, and he was to be followed by his eldest son and grandson. The family retained the seat at Cayx, and the beautifully sited old chateau was where Jean-Jacques and his brother were reared; as a young man he styled himself Lefranc de Caix. His mother, born Mademoiselle de Caulet, was of the same millieu, her father serving as a &quot;president of the morter&quot; - a judicial rank - at the Parlement de Toulouse, where Jean-Jacques was also to have a brief tenure.

His education was entrusted to &quot; ... the most skillful masters at the Capital, where he found himself among the disciples of the celebrated Pere Poré. The student made rapid progress, and was not slow in showing proof of a talent as rare as it was precocious. After successfully completing his classical studies [at the Collège de Louis-le-Grand], he remained in Paris to attend the School of Law.&quot; Voltaire, fifteen years older than Lefranc, attended this school from 1704 to 1711, and was also influenced by Pere Poré.

He joined the staff of the Cours des Aides in 1730, during the presidency of his uncle, the abbé Louis Lefranc, who had succeeded his brother, Jean-Jacques&#x27; father Jacques, on the death of the latter in 1719. When Louis died in 1745, Jean-Jacques, who had by then served for fifteen years as a general advocate at the court, although expected to succeed him in turn, was not yet old enough to be awarded the position, and had to wait until early 1747 to take over its presidency.

The same year he was also appointed &quot;conseiller d&#x27;honneur&quot; of the Toulouse parlement, but his opposition to the abuses of the royal power, especially in the matter of taxation, brought him so much trouble that he resigned almost immediately.

==Early works==

His first play, &quot;Didon&quot; (1734), which owed much to Metastasio&#x27;s opera on the same subject, was a great success, and gave rise to expectations not fulfilled by the &quot;Adieux de Mars&quot; (1735) and some light operas that followed.

His reputation was made by &quot;Poésies sacrées et philosophiques&quot; (1734), later mocked by Voltaire, who punned on the title: &quot;Sacrés ils sont, car personne n&#x27;y touche&quot; (&quot;They are sacred all right, because no one will touch them&quot;). Lefranc&#x27;s odes on profane (or worldly) subjects hardly reach the same level of quality, with the exception of his ode on the death of JB Rousseau, which achieved considerable renown.

==The &quot;Academie&quot; and the war with Voltaire==

His marriage with a wealthy widow enabled him to devote himself fully to literature, and also funded his campaign for a seat in the Académie française, which was achieved in 1759.

However, on his formal induction into the &quot;Academie&quot; in 1760, he made an ill-considered speech violently attacking the Encyclopaedists, many of whom were in his audience and had voted for him.

Lefranc soon had reason to repent of his action, for the epigrams and stories circulated by those he had attacked made it difficult for him to remain in Paris, and he returned to his native town, where he spent the rest of his life gardening, writing poetry and translating from the classics.

Jean-François de la Harpe, who is severe enough on Lefranc in his correspondence, does his abilities full justice in his &quot;Cours littéraire&quot;, and ranks him next to JB Rousseau among French lyric poets. With those of other 18th-century poets his works may be studied in the &quot;Petits poètes français&quot; (1838) of Prosper Poitevin. His &quot;Œuvres complètes&quot; (5 vols.) were published in 1781, selections (2 vols.) in 1800, 1813, 1822.

==The chateau and its &quot;parc a fabriques&quot;==

Beginning in 1745, Lefranc rebuilt the manor house at Pompignan as the present neoclassical Chateau de Pompignan, and over a period of thirty-five years created a very extensive landscape garden, containing many follies, or architectural constructions to enhance the natural and created landscape. These included ruined temples, a gothic bridge, pleasure houses, and an extensive hydraulic and reservoir system which managed a lake and fishpond, streams, fountains and the water for the house.

==Family==

Jean-Jaques&#x27; younger brother, Jean Georges Lefranc de Pompignan, rose through the hierarchy to become Archbishop of Vienne and a favourite of the king, whose eulogy he delivered.

Pompignan was also the alleged biological father of the French suffragist and playwright Olympe de Gouges (1748-1793).

<text>Godalming ( ) is a market town and civil parish in southwest Surrey, England, around southwest of central London. It is in the Borough of Waverley, at the confluence of the Rivers Wey and Ock. The civil parish covers and includes the settlements of Farncombe, Binscombe and Aaron&#x27;s Hill. Much of the area lies on the strata of the Lower Greensand Group and Bargate stone was quarried locally until the Second World War.

The earliest evidence of human activity is from the Paleolithic and land above the Wey floodplain at Charterhouse was first settled in the middle Iron Age. The modern town is believed to have its origins in the 6th or early 7th centuries and its name is thought to derive from that of a Saxon landowner. Kersey, a woollen cloth, dyed blue, was produced at Godalming for much of the Middle Ages, but the industry declined in the early modern period. In the 17th century, the town began to specialise in the production of knitted textiles and in the manufacture of hosiery in particular.

Throughout its history, Godalming has benefitted from its location on the main route from London to Portsmouth Dockyard. Local transport links were improved from the early 18th century with the opening of the turnpike road through the town in 1749 and the construction of the Godalming Navigation in 1764. Expansion of the settlement began in the mid-19th century, stimulated by the opening of the first railway station in 1849 and the relocation of Charterhouse School from London in 1872. The town has a claim to be the first place in the world to have a combined public and private electricity supply.

Several buildings in the town centre date from the 16th and 17th centuries. The distinctive Pepperpot was built in 1814 to replace the medieval market house and to house the council chamber. Among the notable former residents of the civil parish were Jack Phillips, the senior wireless operator on the , and the mountaineer George Mallory. James Oglethorpe, the founder of the Colony of Georgia, was born in Godalming in 1696 and the town maintains a friendship with the U.S. state and the cities of Savannah and Augusta in particular.

==Toponymy==
The oldest surviving record of Godalming is from a copy of the will of Alfred the Great, in which the settlement appears as &quot;Godelmingum&quot;. The name is written as &quot;Godelminge&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086, and later as &quot;Godelminges&quot; (), &quot;Godhelming&quot; (), &quot;Godalminges&quot; () and &quot;Godalmyn&quot; (). The second part of the name is thought to derive from the Old English &quot;ingas&quot; and means &quot;people of&quot; or &quot;family of&quot; and the first part may refer to an Anglo-Saxon individual called &quot;Godhelm&quot;. Thomas William Shore (18401905) suggested that &quot;Godhelm&quot; may be of Gothic origin and Robert Eugen Zachrisson (18801937) proposed that it may have been an early name for the River Ock or another local stream. Residents of Godalming are sometimes called &quot;Godhelmians&quot;.

The first records of Binscombe and Busbridge are from the 13th century, when they appear as &quot;Budenscombe&quot; and &quot;Bursbrige&quot; respectively. Their names are thought to derive from individuals called &quot;Byden&quot; and &quot;Beohrtsige&quot;, names both found in Old English. Catteshall may mean &quot;hill of the wild cat&quot; or &quot;hill belonging to a person called &quot;Catt&quot;&quot;. Farncombe appears in Domesday Book as &quot;Fearnecombe&quot; and is thought to mean &quot;valley of the ferns&quot;. Frith Hill may derive from the Middle English &quot;frith&quot;, meaning &quot;woodland&quot;.

==Geography==

===Location===
Godalming is a town in the Borough of Waverley in southwest Surrey, around from central London and from Guildford. The town is in the valley of the River Wey, which flows northwards through Guildford to join the River Thames at Weybridge. Godalming High Street runs roughly east to west, linking an ancient crossing point of the Wey to the road leading south over Holloway Hill. The town is almost completely surrounded by the Metropolitan Green Belt and the Surrey Hills National Landscape is to the north and west.

Godalming Civil Parish has a total area of . It includes the settlements of Binscombe, Frith Hill and Charterhouse (north of the river) and Aaron&#x27;s Hill, Ockford Ridge and Crownpits (to the south). The majority of the built-up area of Busbridge is also in Godalming Civil Parish. Farncombe, to the north of the town, has a strong village identity and incorporates a small cluster of local shops on Farncombe and St John&#x27;s Streets. Godalming has good transport links to London and Portsmouth via the railway line and A3 road.

At the west end of the town, the River Wey is joined by the River Ock, which rises at Witley, to the south. The main urban areas of Godalming and Farncombe are separated from the Wey by the floodplain, which includes the water meadows known as the Lammas Lands. Serious flooding events occurred in the local area in 1968, 1990, 2000, 2013 and 2020; new defences, including the construction of a flood wall and two pumping stations, were installed in the winter of 2018–19.

===Geology===
Godalming lies on the northwestern side of the Weald and primarily sits on the strata of the Lower Greensand Group, laid down in the early Cretaceous. Atherfield Clay is found in the extreme north of the civil parish at Binscombe, where there was a former brickworks. Holloway Hill and much of the town centre are on the Hythe Beds, a loamy, fine-grained sandy layer that also includes some sandstone and chert. Although rare elsewhere in these strata, fossils of mollusc species occur in these beds in the Godalming area, including the bivalves &quot;Ostrea macroptera&quot; and &quot;Exogyra sinuata&quot;, and the brachiopods &quot;Rhynchonella parvirostris&quot; and &quot;Waldheimia tamarindus&quot;.
Frith Hill and Charterhouse are on the iron-rich Bargate Beds, a part of the more widespread lower Sandgate Formation that is only found in the Godalming area. This layer contains Bargate stone, a dark honey-coloured calcerous sandstone that was quarried until the Second World War at several sites in the civil parish. There are also small exposures of the sandy Folkestone Beds at Busbridge and to the northwest of Charterhouse. River gravels are found in the valleys of the Wey and Ock to the west and south of the town centre, and as a terrace at Farncombe. Alluvial deposits of sand and silt are found in the floodplain of the Wey, especially between Bridge Street and Catteshall.

==History==
===Early history===

The earliest evidence of human activity in the Godalming area is from the Stone Age. At least two Paleolithic hand axes as well as Mesolithic flint blades and flakes have been found in the civil parish. In 2017, a local schoolboy discovered a Bronze Age barbed and tanged arrowhead, which he subsequently donated to Godalming Museum. The higher ground above the River Wey floodplain at Charterhouse was occupied during the middle Iron Age and human habitation is thought to have continued into the early Roman period. There is thought to have been a small farmstead on the site in the late first century C.E. and there was also a villa at Binscombe.
The Anglo-Saxon settlement at Godalming is thought to have been founded in the 6th or early 7th centuries, in the area surrounding the parish church. The oldest stonework in the church dates from and the base of the west wall of the tower is of Anglo-Saxon origin. The earliest documentary evidence for Godalming, is from the will of Alfred the Great in 880, in which the settlement and surrounding land is left to his nephew, Æthelwold ætheling. By the end of the Anglo-Saxon period, the town was the administrative centre of the Godalming Hundred, which stretched from Puttenham in the northwest to Chiddingfold in the southeast.

===Governance===
The town appears as &quot;Godelminge&quot; in Domesday Book; in 1086 it was held by Ranulf Flambard, who also held Tuesley and parts of Guildford. The manor had sufficient land for 25 plough teams. It included 40 acres of meadow, woodland for 103 swine, three mills, two churches, and generated an annual income of £34. Farncombe appears in Domesday Book as &quot;Fernecome&quot; and was held by Odo of Bayeux.

At some point in the late 11th century, the Manor of Godalming was divided into two parts. The King&#x27;s Manor was held by the Crown through the 12th century. There is evidence to suggest that it was held by Stephen de Turnham in 1206, but in 1221 it was granted to the Bishop of Salisbury by Henry III. It was held by the Bishop until 1541, when it was conveyed to Thomas Paston, who returned it to the Crown the following year. It was held by the monarch through the Tudor period until 1601, when Elizabeth I sold it to George More of Loseley Park.
The second part of the Manor of Godalming, known as the Rectory Manor or Deanshold, was granted to Salisbury Cathedral by Henry I in the early 12th century. It remained in the custodianship of the dean and chapter until the mid-19th century. For much of its history, the manor was leased to the Castillion family, but was held by the Ogelthorpe family in the 18th century. In 1846, the Rectory Manor was transferred to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, who began to break up and sell off the estate in the early 1860s.

The first charter to be granted to Godalming was issued by Edward I on 7 June 1300. In it, he authorised a weekly market and a three-day annual fair on the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul in late June. The right to hold a market was confirmed by Elizabeth I in 1563 and, in January 1575, she issued a Charter of Incorporation, enabling Godalming to become a self-governing borough. The charter specified that a &quot;warden&quot; (effectively a mayor) should be elected by the town each year at Michaelmas. In 1620, Francis Bacon, the Lord Chancellor under James I, issued a document entitled &quot;Ordinances and constitutions made and established for the better and government of the Town of Godalming in the County of Surry&quot;, which specified that the administration of the town should be the responsibility of the warden and eight assistants. It also provided for the appointment of a bailiff and restricted the amount of time that townspeople could spend in local inns and hostelries.

The modern system of local government began to emerge in the first half of the 19th century. Under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, the town became a borough corporation under the control of a mayor and elected councillors. The following year, the Guildford Poor Law Union was formed, with responsibility for a total area of stretching from Godalming to Woking. As a result of the Local Government Act 1888, several responsibilities were transferred from the borough to the newly formed Surrey County Council. Farncombe was originally a separate civil parish, but became part of Godalming borough in 1892. The most recent change in local government took place in 1974, when the municipal boroughs of Godalming and Haslemere were merged with the Farnham Urban District and Hambledon Rural District to form Waverley District. At the same time, Godalming Town Council was constituted as the lowest tier of local government in the civil parish. The district became a borough on 21 February 1984, following the grant of a royal charter by Elizabeth II.

===Commerce and industry===
The right to hold a market was granted to Godalming in 1300 by Edward I. It probably took place each week at the junction of Church Street and the High Street. The right was confirmed in the 1563 charter of Elizabeth I, which stipulated that the market should be held every Wednesday. In 1674, the day was changed to Friday, but had reverted to Wednesday by the start of the 19th century. The market ceased in around 1879. The right to hold a fair each July was also granted in the charter of 1300 and continued to be held until 1870. A second annual fair, which originally took place over three days around Candlemas each February, was granted by Elizabeth I. By the start of the 19th century, the fair had been reduced to a single day and is last recorded in 1910.
Three watermills are recorded in the entry for Godalming in Domesday Book. Although their identities are uncertain, the present day Catteshall, Hatch and Westbrook Mills on the River Wey are thought to be the likely locations. Hatch Mill, close to the parish church, may be the oldest mill site in Godalming. Catteshall Mill, to the northeast of the town centre, is first recorded in 1300 and was used for milling corn from until 1836. The two Westbrook Mills, also on the Wey, are around apart and are not clearly distinguished in historical records until the mid-19th century, when the upper mill became known as Salgasson Mill.

Godalming&#x27;s medieval prosperity was founded on the wool trade. The North Downs provided good grazing land for sheep, there were local deposits of Fuller&#x27;s earth in Surrey and the Wey provided a source of both water and power for fulling mills. Like Guildford, to the north, the town specialised in the manufacture of kersey, a coarse cloth, dyed blue. Fulling took place at Catteshall Mill between 1300 and 1660, and at the Westbrook Mills in the 17th and early 18th centuries. Dyers are known to have been active in the town in the 17th century, but the kersey industry went into a steep decline in the middle of the century. Woollen cloth production ended at Guildford in the 1710s, but continued on a small scale in Godalming for around another 100 years.
As cloth manufacture declined in Godalming, it was replaced by the production of knitted and woven textiles. A cottage industry developed in the town in the 17th century, producing woollen, silk and later cotton garments. Hosiery was knitted using a stocking frame invented by William Lee in the 1580s. Until the 18th century, most garments were produced by families working at home, but thereafter the industry became increasingly centralised. George Holland set up a factory in around 1790 for the manufacture of &quot;Fleecy and Segovia Hosiery&quot;, using specially prepared wool. The Pitchers company was established in the town in 1885 and produced &quot;Charterhouse sweaters&quot;, among other woollen items. The firm, which closed in the 1960s, is credited with the invention of a machine to produce the cable stitch.

Leather production was a significant part of the local economy from the mid-15th to mid-20th centuries. Tanneries are recorded at several sites in the town, including at Ockford Road, Meadrow and Catteshall Lock. In 1808, a &quot;bark house&quot; was erected in Mill Street for grinding bark and chamois leather was produced at the Westbrook Mills in the 19th century. The final leather producer in Godalming closed in 1952.

The Godalming area was an important centre for papermaking and, in the early 17th century, several mills in the town produced coarse sheets of &quot;whited brown paper&quot;. Papermaking took place at the Westbrook Mills in the 17th and early 18th centuries, and at Catteshall Mill from the 1660s until 1928.

===Transport and communications===

A ford across the Wey at the site of the current Town Bridge was established by the 12th century. In the late-medieval period, there was also a bridge owned by the Lord of the Manor at this location, but the ford was used by townspeople except in times of flood. The road through Godalming between Kingston upon Thames and Petersfield was turnpiked in 1749 and the present Town Bridge was constructed in 1782 by the County Surveyor, George Gwilt. The road south from the town centre through Busbridge to Hascombe was turnpiked in 1826.
The Wey has been used for navigation since ancient times and it is likely that wool, cloth and timber were transported via the unimproved river during the medieval period. The River Wey Navigation, between the River Thames and Guildford was authorised by Act of Parliament in 1651. Although its southern terminus was four miles north of the town, the opening of the new waterway had a positive impact on the economy of Godalming.

The Wey Navigation Act 1760 authorised the construction of the Godalming Navigation. The waterway, which opened in 1764 with four locks, extended the navigable stretch of river southwards. A wharf was constructed on the south side of the Wey, close to the town centre. The busiest period for the navigation was during the 1810s, when timber, flour, and goods made of iron were shipped from Godalming, but after the arrival of the railway in 1849, it went into sharp decline. After 1918, there were only two commercial barges working the river south of Guildford and the final shipments from Godalming took place in 1925. The Godalming Navigation passed to the National Trust in 1968.
The first railway station in Godalming opened in 1849 on the north side of the Wey. It was the southern terminus of the line built by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) from . A decade later, the line to was constructed speculatively by the engineer, Thomas Brassey. This line was initially single track and joined the branch from Guildford to the north of the first railway station. Although construction was completed in 1858, the first passenger trains south of Godalming did not run until January of the following year. Initially there were four services in each direction per day between Guildford and Havant, which had increased to seven (with a single short working to ) by 1890. The opening of the line necessitated the building of the current railway station, although the original station was retained until 1969 for freight. Farncombe railway station, the only intermediate station between Guildford and Godalming, opened on 1 May 1897. The line south of Godalming was doubled in 1871 and was electrified in 1937.
Late 19th century improvements in the local road network included the construction of Borough Road and Borough Bridge to link the newly opened Charterhouse School to the town centre. The Guildford and Godalming bypass (now the A3) was opened in July 1934. In the 1990s, Flambard Way was built to divert through traffic around the town centre. Its construction divided Queen Street in two and severed the connections from Mill Lane and Holloway Hill to the High Street.

===Residential development===

The basic layout of Church Street, the High Street and Bridge Street are thought to have been established by the 13th century and may be pre-conquest in origin. The Saxon settlement was concentrated in the Church Street area and Godalming expanded along the modern High Street in the 11th and 12th centuries. The first houses may have been constructed in The Mint in the late 13th or early 14th centuries. The town does not appear to have expanded significantly in the early modern period, although the oldest surviving buildings in the centre date from the 16th century. The settlement at Binscombe village grew up in the medieval period around Binscombe Farm. Much of the hamlet, including the original farmhouse, is designated a Conservation Area.

Godalming began to grow in the mid-19th century, catalysed by the opening of the first railway station in 1849 and the arrival of Charterhouse School in 1872. The first cottages were constructed at Crownpits in the 1880s and farmland to the south of the town centre was sold for development in the same decade. Summerhouse, Busbridge and Oakdene Roads had been laid out by the mid-1890s and most of the houses had been built by the end of the century. The area north of Home Farm Road was developed in the 1970s and the Bargate Wood estate was built in the 1980s.

Farncombe began to grow in the early Victorian era, with terraced housing, semi-detached houses and larger villas being built along new streets branching from existing roads such as Hare Lane, Summers Road and Farncombe Street. Until the mid-19th century, Charterhouse and Furze Hill were part of Deanery Farm, although much of the latter was woodland. In 1865, the land was sold in lots, with being acquired for the site of Charterhouse School. Houses in Deanery and Peperharrow Roads were built in the early 1870s, but in the mid-20th century many were either divided into flats or demolished, and higher-density housing was constructed on their former gardens. In the 1960s, the school vacated its properties on Frith Hill Road and on Markenholm, and the sites were sold for residential development. Housing on The Brambles was constructed in the mid-1980s. The most recent major developments in Farncombe took place in the early 21st century off Furze Lane.

The first council housing in the civil parish was constructed in 1920 around The Oval and Broadwater Lane in Farncombe. The first 168 houses on the Ockford Ridge estate, west of the town centre, were completed in 1931 and were followed by a further 32 new homes on Cliffe Road in 1935. After the Second World War, the Aaron&#x27;s Hill development was built on the site of the former Ockford House. The Binscombe estate was constructed in the 1950s, to the northwest of Farncombe.

===Godalming in the world wars===
During the First World War, soldiers were billeted at nearby Witley Camp. A canteen was set up in Croft Road for those arriving via Godalming station. Allotments were planted at the Holloway Hill Recreation Ground and villagers in Busbridge were employed to manufacture baskets for 18 lb high-explosive shells. In October 1914, the Red Cross opened a hospital for wounded soldiers at Charterhouse School.

During the Second World War, the defence of Godalming was the responsibility of the 4th Battalion of the Surrey Home Guard, part of South East Command. A total of 213 bombs fell on the town, including two V-1 flying bombs, although no civilians were killed. In September 1939, around 40 children were evacuated to Busbridge from Wandsworth and several houses in Godalming were requisitioned to provide accommodation for soldiers. St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital Medical School was also evacuated to Godalming and used the Charterhouse School science laboratories to teach in. Many students joined local home guard. A British Restaurant was opened in Angel Yard and Branksome House, in Filmer Grove, served as a district control centre. The manufacturer, RFD, set up a factory in Catteshall Lane to produce barrage balloons, inflatable boats and life jackets and, by the end of the war, was employing over 1000 local people.

==National and local government==
===UK parliament===
The entirety of Godalming Civil Parish is in the revised (2024) parliamentary constituency of Godalming and Ash

===County council===
Surrey County Council, headquartered in Reigate, is elected every four years. Godalming is represented by two councillors.
===Borough council===
The town is divided into four wards; Binscombe and Charterhouse, Central and Ockford, Farncombe and Catteshall, and Holloway. Godalming is represented by nine councillors, elected to Waverley Borough Council:
===Godalming Town Council===

Godalming Town Council is the lowest tier of local government in the civil parish. A total of 20 councillors is elected every four years. Each year, one councillor is chosen as the Mayor, who represents the town on civic occasions and who is recognised as the principal citizen of Godalming. Godalming is twinned with Mayen, Germany (April 1982) and Joigny, France (May 1985). The town retains strong friendship links with the state of Georgia, USA, and with the cities of Savannah and Augusta in particular, through the organisation, the Friends of Oglethorpe. Since 2011, the town council has held the power to confer the titles of &quot;Honorary Freeman&quot; and &quot;Honorary Freewoman&quot; on residents who have demonstrated outstanding service to or made a significant contribution to the community. As of 2022, two people (Zadie Caudle and John Young) have been recognised in this way.

==Demography and housing==


==Public services==
===Utilities===

For much of the town&#x27;s history, residents obtained drinking water from local rivers or from wells. In the early 19th century, a hand-operated pump was installed next to the Pepperpot in the High Street. A well was dug at Charterhouse to supply the school with water. In around 1880, water mains were installed in Godalming and Farncombe, fed from a water tower on Frith Hill. In 1899, the borough council purchased the water tower, becoming responsible for the drinking water supply to the town until 1974. In that year, the water tower was decommissioned and a new covered reservoir was opened at Sandy Lane.

The town sewerage system was constructed in 1894 and included a sewage works at Unstead Farm, to the north of Farncombe. Until this point, waste water had been disposed of in cesspits, resulting in the contamination of drinking water wells; outbreaks of cholera and typhoid are recorded in Godalming in the 18th and 19th centuries. The municipal tip was opened next to the sewage works in the early 1900s.

The Godalming Gas and Coke Company was established in 1825 and purchased part of Godalming Wharf for the site of its gasworks. Gas was provided for street lighting between 1836 and 1881, and again from 1884 to 1900. The coal required initially arrived by barge, but was delivered by train after the first railway station opened in 1849. The gasworks closed in 1957, when the town supply was linked to that of Guildford.
Godalming has a claim to be the first town in the world to have a combined public and private electricity supply. The price of gas had risen during the 1870s and the borough sought an alternative method of providing street lighting. In 1881, the London firm of Calder and Barrett installed a generator driven by two Poncelet waterwheels at Westbrook Mill. The electricity was used to power three 250 V arc lights at the mill and overhead cables were run above Mill Street to the town centre, where a further four arc lights were installed. A second, 40 V circuit supplied 34 incandescent lamps (of which seven were at the mill and the remainder were in the town centre). The scheme met with mixed success and there were criticisms that the lights in the town centre were too dim, while those at the mill were too bright. By the end of 1881, the generator had been moved to the rear of the White Hart pub, where it was driven by a steam engine and, in April 1882, Siemens took over the operation. The electricity supply continued until 1884, when Siemens refused to bid for the renewal of its contract and the town reverted to gas lighting.

The second power station in Godalming was opened in Borough Road in 1902. By the end of the following year, two 90 kW and one 200 kW steam-powered generators had been installed, which were replaced in 1928 by a 200 kW diesel-driven generator. Under the Electricity (Supply) Act 1926, Godalming was connected to the National Grid, initially to a 33 kV supply ring, which linked the town to Guildford, Hindhead, Woking and Aldershot. In 1932, the ring was connected to the Wimbledon-Woking main via a 132 kV substation at West Byfleet. By the time of its closure in 1949, the Borough Road power station had an installed capacity of 600 kW.

===Emergency services===
From the early part of the 17th century, the borough appears to have employed a &quot;bedle&quot; or &quot;bellman&quot; to apprehend troublemakers and, in 1747, there is a reference to a &quot;cage prison&quot; in Godalming. By 1762, a uniformed town watchman was employed with an annual salary of £10 and a &quot;constable of Godalming&quot; is first recorded in 1817. The borough police force was formed in 1836 and briefly became part of the county force from 1851 to 1857. By 1868, the police station was in Moss Lane and had three cells capable of holding a total of nine people. The force was led by a superintendent, assisted by a constable, a night watch and several special constables.

In 1889, the borough force became part of the Surrey Constabulary, under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1888. A new police station, built on the site of the former gasworks, opened in 1969 and closed in 2012. In 2022, policing in the civil parish is the responsibility of Surrey Police and the nearest police station run by the force is at Guildford.
The first fire station in Godalming was constructed in Moss Lane in 1816. It housed a manual fire pump, mounted on a pushcart, that could be used by local residents when the need arose. It was not until 1870 that the town fire brigade was formally constituted, initially as a volunteer force, with the equipment funded by public subscription. Six years later, the station moved to Godalming Wharf and, in 1894, the borough took over the running of the brigade. From this point onwards, the firefighters were paid for each incident that they attended, with the cost charged to the property owners who used their services. In 1904, the borough purchased a horse-drawn steam pump and, in May of the same year, the force moved to a new fire station in Queen Street. During the Second World War, it became part of the National Fire Service and, in 1948, Surrey Fire and Rescue Service was formed. The fire brigade moved to the current station in Bridge Road in 1972.

In 2022, the local fire authority is Surrey County Council and the statutory fire service is the Surrey Fire and Rescue Service. Godalming Ambulance Station, in Catteshall Lane, is run by the South East Coast Ambulance Service.

===Healthcare===

The Meath Epilepsy Charity was founded in 1892 by Mary Jane Brabazon, Countess of Meath. She purchased Westbrook House and opened the &quot;Home of Comfort for Epileptic Women and Girls&quot;. By 1920, The Meath, as it became known, was offering residential care for 87 patients. In 2020, 82 adults with epilepsy were offered residential care and the charity supported an additional 30 clients. Changing Perceptions, in Godalming High Street, is The Meath&#x27;s social enterprise and offers patients opportunities to work in the furniture workshop and in the café.

The nearest hospital with an A&amp;E is the Royal Surrey County Hospital, from Godalming. As of 2022, the town has two GP practices, one at Catteshall Mill and one at Binscombe.

==Transport==
===Bus and train===

Godalming is linked by a number of bus routes to surrounding towns and villages in southwest Surrey. Operators serving the town include Compass Bus, Stagecoach and the Compo Community Bus.

South Western Railway operates all services from both and Farncombe stations. Trains run to via and to via . There is a taxi rank at Godalming station.

===River navigation===
The River Wey is navigable from Godalming northwards to Weybridge and the navigation authority is the National Trust. The head of navigation is at Godalming Wharf, about downstream of Town Bridge. Catteshall Lock has a fall of and is the southernmost lock on the connected inland waterways of Great Britain.

===Long-distance cycleway and footpath===
The Farnham Link of the Surrey Cycleway runs through the civil parish from Charterhouse via the town centre to Holloway Hill. The final stage of the Tour of Britain 2012 passed through Godalming.

The Fox Way, a footpath that encircles Guildford, follows the towpath of the Wey Navigation from Catteshall to Town Bridge, before running north of the town centre and Aaron&#x27;s Hill towards Eashing.

==Education==
===Early schools===

There are thought to have been dame schools operating in Godalming in the 16th and 17th centuries, but the first surviving reference to formal education in the town is from 1715, in which a school for 50 poor boys is recorded. The National school opened in Mint Road in February 1813 and moved to the former workhouse in Moss Lane in 1843. The workhouse buildings were demolished in 1910 and new classrooms were constructed on the same site. The school moved to new premises on Franklyn Road in the early 1970s and was renamed to become St Mark&#x27;s School. A further change of name took place in 2008 and the school is now known as Green Oak School.

A British school opened in Hart&#x27;s Yard in December 1812, but moved to Bridge Road in February the following year. It educated children between the ages of 6 and 13. The premises were rebuilt in 1872 and are now occupied by the Busy Bees nursery school. Busbridge School was founded in 1865 and three years later it became a National school. In 1868 there were 64 children on the roll, but by 1906, the school had 166 pupils.

St John&#x27;s School, Farncombe opened in 1856; both the George Road and Meadrow Schools opened in 1906. Moss Lane County Primary School opened on the former workhouse site in 1975, but became an infants school in 1994.

===Maintained schools===
Broadwater School, in the north of the civil parish, was established in 1967. It was built on part of the former Broadwater House estate. The school educates around 570 pupils aged from 11 to 16. It became part of the Greenshaw Learning Trust in September 2020.

Godalming College, to the south of the town centre, was founded in 1975 on the campus of the former Godalming Grammar School. It caters for 1619-year-olds and is state maintained. The Performing Arts Centre was opened in March 2008 and the English and Modern Foreign Languages Centre was opened in September 2016.

===Independent schools===
Charterhouse School was founded in 1611 in a former Carthusian monastery near Smithfield in London and relocated to Godalming in 1872. The main school buildings were designed by the architect, Philip Charles Hardwick, and the chapel, by Giles Gilbert Scott, was erected in 1927 as a memorial to former pupils who had died in the First World War. Initially the school was for boys only but, from 1971, girls were accepted into the sixth form. Girls were first admitted into Year 9 in 2021 and the school became fully coeducational in September 2023.

St Hilary&#x27;s Preparatory School is an independent preparatory school for boys and girls aged 2–11. It was founded in Tuesley Lane in August 1927 and moved to its present site on Holloway Hill in 1936. The nursery department opened in 1946 and the school became a limited company in 1965. In November 2024, the school merged with St Edmund&#x27;s School, Hindhead.

==Places of worship==
The oldest parts of the Parish Church of St Peter and St Paul date from the 9th century. The location of the church, on a sandstone knoll above the River Wey floodplain, is thought to have been the site of the original settlement of Godalming. By the early 11th century, the church is thought to have consisted of a nave and chancel; transepts and a tower were added in the early Norman period. A major rebuilding took place in the 13th century, which included the addition of a spire. The church owes its present appearance to restoration and remodelling work by George Gilbert Scott in the 19th century. The interior of the building includes the font, dated to the 15th or early 16th century, the carved wooden pulpit from and the parish chest from . A daughter church, St Mark&#x27;s, was opened in 1934.

Monthly Quaker meetings are thought to have been taking place in Binscombe by 1656, when the Dissenter George Fox is known to have preached there. The burial ground in the village was in use from 1659 until 1790. A lending library for Quakers was established in Godalming in 1676 and the Meeting House on Mill Lane was built in the 1710s. The building retains much of its original interior, including wooden panelling and fixed benches. The writer, Mary Waring, was an Elder of the meeting and kept a diary of her religious experiences.
Meadrow Unitarian Chapel, on the north side of the River Wey, was opened in 1789 as a General Baptist chapel. The building included a baptistry equipped with a pool suitable for immersion baptism. In the early 19th century, the congregation began to embrace Unitarianism. Religious services moved to a new building in 1870, but returned to the original chapel in the mid-1970s.

Although John Wesley visited the town four times, attempts in the late 18th century to establish Methodism in Godalming were unsuccessful. The current congregation traces its origins to a group that began meeting in the High Street in 1826 and that later moved to the former Congregational Church in Hart Lane in 1869. A second relocation to the Bridge Road Church, named after the religious reformer Hugh Price Hughes, opened in 1903.

Busbridge Parish Church was designed by George Gilbert Scott in the Early English style and was consecrated in 1867. The windows at the west end were designed by Edward Burne-Jones and the wrought-iron chancel screen was designed by Edwin Lutyens.
The first Catholic church in the town was a temporary iron church, erected in Croft Road in 1899. The Godalming parish was created in 1904 and the first priest was appointed in November of that year. The foundation stone of the new church, St Edmund&#x27;s, was laid in November 1905 and construction was completed in June 1906. The grade II-listed building was designed by Frederick Walters in the Early English style.

==Culture==
===Art===

Godalming Museum owns paintings by James Peel and Gertrude Jekyll as well as a sculpture of the artist, George Frederic Watts, by Louis Reid Deuchars. The collection also includes portraits of Thomas Henry Huxley and Jack Phillips by John Collier and Ellis Martin respectively. The Tate holds an oil painting by J. M. W. Turner entitled &quot;Godalming from the South&quot;, dated to 1805; the gallery also holds two pencil sketches of the town skyline by the same artist.

===Literature, film and television===
In Charles Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;, Nicholas and Smike stay the night in Godalming, en route from London to Portsmouth: &quot;To Godalming they came at last, and here they bargained for two humble beds, and slept soundly.&quot; Much of the action in &quot;Bulldog Drummond&quot; by Sapper takes place in Godalming. Binscombe features as a location in &quot;The Hog&#x27;s Back Mystery&quot; (1933) by the detective-fiction writer Freeman Wills Crofts.

Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond short story, &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;, referred to Godalming as a venue for retired colonial civil servants with memories of postings to places &quot;that no one at the local golf club would have heard about or would care about.&quot; In &quot;The Rose of Tibet&quot; (1962) by thriller writer, Lionel Davidson, two characters are described as talking &quot;for hours&quot; of a shared link with Godalming. In a somewhat &quot;backhanded compliment&quot;, their exotic (and perilous) Tibetan location is held to be &quot;All a long, long way from damp, soft Godalming with its mushy autumnal leaves underfoot and its dark green trains commuting to Waterloo.&quot; The comic novel &quot;The Return of Reginald Perrin&quot;, by David Nobbs, contains the following: &quot;Note: It is believed that this book mentions Godalming more than any other book ever written, including &quot;A Social, Artistic and Economic History of Godalming&quot; by E. Phipps-Blythburgh.&quot;

The 2006 romantic comedy film, &quot;The Holiday&quot;, and the 2022 television series, &quot;Inside Man&quot;, include scenes filmed in Godalming.

===Music and theatre===

Godalming Band has been active in its current form since 1937, but its predecessors operated in the town from . The first performances took place to celebrate the coronation of George VI and Elizabeth. The first overseas trip, to one of Godalming&#x27;s twin towns, Mayen, Germany, took place in 1979. The band performs regularly at local venues, including at the Godalming Bandstand.

The Godalming Youth Orchestra was founded in 1979 and welcomes players of orchestral instruments between the ages of 8 and 17. The Godalming Theatre Group was founded as the Youth Centre Theatre Group in 1964. It typically performs three times a year - a musical in the spring, a play in the autumn and a pantomime at Christmas. Local performances generally take place at Charterhouse School, but the group has toured internationally to Augusta, Mayen and Joigny.

==Sport==
===Leisure centre===
Godalming Leisure Centre at Broadwater Park was opened in 2012, replacing the previous centre dating from the mid-1970s. It offers a 25 m pool, a teaching pool a fitness gym, a sauna and a soft play area.

===Association football===

Godalming Town F.C. was founded as Godalming United F.C. in 1950 by former pupils of Godalming Grammar School. Originally, the team played its home games at the Holloway Hill Recreation Ground, but moved to Meadrow in Farncombe in 1970. The current stadium is named in memory of Bill Kyte, a former president and longstanding supporter of the club.

Old Carthusians F.C. was founded in 1876 by a group of former pupils of Charterhouse School. The team won the FA Cup in 1881 and the FA Amateur Cup three times in the 1890s. In 2022, the club is a member of the Arthurian League and the first team plays its home games at the school playing fields.

===Cricket===
Cricket is known to have been well established in Godalming by 1767 and the first definite reference to a Godalming team is from 1786. By 1883, the town team had begun playing at Holloway Hill Recreation Ground, then known as Whitehart Field. The present Godalming Cricket Club was constituted in 1926.

The first recorded cricket match at Broadwater Park took place in 1850 and a Surrey v Nottinghamshire county match took place there in 1854. Farncombe Cricket Club was founded on 6 April 1938 and played its first match on the 30th of the same month. The club has leased its home ground at Broadwater Park from the borough council from the outset. The first pavilion, a wooden building previously the staff living quarters of the Bramley Grange Hotel, was erected in 1949. It was replaced in the first half of 1972 and the new building was extended twice in the following decade to provide a larger social space.

===Other sports===
Guildford R.F.C. was formed in 2002, following a merger between Guildford &amp; Godalming and Old Guildfordians rugby clubs. The first match as a single, combined team took place in September 2003 and the inaugural season was played in the then, London Division 3SW. The club plays its home games at the Broadwater Sports Club.

The Godalming Angling Society was formed in 1882. The club has rights to fish the Broadwater lake and an stretch of the River Wey from Eashing to Guildford. Members can also fish at five other sites outside of the civil parish.

There are two flat green lawn bowls clubs in the civil parish. Holloway Hill Bowls Club plays at Holloway Hill Recreation Ground and Godalming and Farncombe Bowling Club plays at The Burys. The Godalming and Farncombe club was founded in 1867 and is the second oldest bowling club in Surrey.

==Notable buildings and landmarks==
===Community centres===

Godalming Youth Centre was opened by Wilfrid Noyce, a mountaineer and Charterhouse teacher and former pupil on 6 June 1962. He died in a climbing accident on 24 July of the same year and the centre was renamed in his memory. The centre was renovated between June 2015 and March 2016 to provide new catering facilities and tiered seating.

The Denningberg Centre was opened by Danny Denningberg, then Mayor of Godalming, in October 1974. It is the headquarters of the Godalming Old People&#x27;s Welfare Association and functions as a day centre for the over-55s. It has been run by volunteers from the outset and houses a chiropody clinic and cafe.

The Old Mill, to the north of the High Street, is a day centre run by the National Autistic Society. It offers a range of activities and educational courses to those with autism.

===Town halls and Godalming Museum===

The former town hall, nicknamed The Pepperpot due to its cupola, is a distinctive octagonal building in the High Street. Located on the site of the medieval market house, its construction was funded by public donations. It was built in 1814, although the central stair tower was not added until in the 1890s. The ground floor is open and takes the form of a round-arched arcade. The upstairs rooms were used for borough council meetings until 1908.

Godalming Borough Hall, on Bridge Street, was built as a public hall in 1861. It was extended and rebuilt into the present borough hall in 1906 and the council began meeting in the purpose-built chamber in 1908.
Godalming Museum opened in 1921 on the upper floor of The Pepperpot. It moved in November 1987 to 107109 High Street, a timber-framed Wealden house dating from the 1440s. The museum houses numerous artefacts relating to the history of the local area and the Arts and Crafts movement in southwest Surrey.

===Memorials===
The chief radio operator of , Jack Phillips, was born and lived in Farncombe. After the ship struck an iceberg on the night of 14–15 April 1912, he remained at his post, sending repeated distress calls until the ship sank. Phillips was honoured by his home town through the construction of a memorial cloister, designed by Hugh Thackeray Turner and a garden by Gertrude Jekyll. A brass plaque was also installed in Farncombe church. The cloister was restored in time for the 100th anniversary of the sinking in 2012.
Godalming War Memorial, dedicated in 1921, was designed by the architect, Albert Powys. It takes the form of a Latin cross, set on top of the northern retaining wall of the churchyard of St Peter and St Paul parish church. The names of the 109 local residents who died in the Second World War are recorded beneath the cross. Those who died in the First World War are remembered on plaques inside the church.

Busbridge War Memorial, in the churchyard of the Church of St John the Baptist, was designed by Edwin Lutyens. It is constructed of Portland stone and takes the form of a cross. It was dedicated in July 1922 and the names of those who died in the First and Second World Wars are recorded on plaques inside the church.

===Other notable buildings===

The King&#x27;s Arms and Royal Hotel, in the High Street, is a former coaching inn and is first recorded in the 17th century. In 1698, Peter the Great stayed at the inn with his entourage, while travelling from Portsmouth to London. A contemporary account, held by the Bodleian Library, records the vast amount of food and drink consumed. A plaque was unveiled in 1998 by the Russian Ambassador to the UK, to mark the 300th anniversary of the Czar&#x27;s visit. Much of the hotel dates from the mid-18th century, including the brick Georgian frontage, constructed in 1753. Some of the interior panelling is from the 17th century, although it is thought to have been refitted in a later refurbishment.

The Red House, on Frith Hill, was built in 1899 by the architect, Edwin Lutyens, for a retired housemaster of Charterhouse School. It is constructed of red brick in a Flemish bond with a plain tile roof and leaded-light windows. Its position, on a sloping hillside, required the front of the building to have two storeys, but the rear has four. The principal internal feature is the central, open-well staircase and the original decoration on the handrail is still visible. The Red House has been described as &quot;an early seminal work by Lutyens&quot;.
Wyatt&#x27;s Almshouses were built in 1622 for Richard Wyatt, the Master Carpenter of the Carpenters&#x27; Company in London. Wyatt stipulated that accommodation should be offered to ten poor men of the parishes of Godalming, Puttenham, Hambledon, Compton and Dunsfold. A chapel was also provided for the use of residents. The ten dwellings were converted into eight apartments in 1959 and new bungalows surrounding the original building were added in the 1960s.

==Parks and open spaces==
===Broadwater Park===
The Broadwater Park is a mixed-use recreation ground to the northeast of Farncombe. For much of its history, the area was owned by the More Molyneux family of Loseley House and the first record of cricket being played there is from 1827. The estate, including the cricket ground, was sold in 1836 to the timber merchant, George Marshall, for the site of Broadwater House. The property remained in the Marshall family until the early 20th century, when it was bought by George Edward Price, a director of the Canadian firm, Price Brothers Ltd. During the First World War, the house was used to accommodate Belgian refugees and the lake was used as an ice rink by Canadian soldiers, who were billeted at Witley Camp.

In 1936, the estate was purchased by Mr W. Hoptroff, a local builder, who in turn offered some of the land to the borough for use as a recreation area. In November of that year, an area of , including the cricket ground, were bought by P. C. Fletcher, the Mayor of Godalming, and presented to the town. In December 1938, an area of was designated a King George&#x27;s Field. In 2022, the park is owned by the borough council and includes areas of woodland and grassland, a multi-use games area, football pitches and tennis courts.

===Other open spaces===
The Lammas Lands are a area of floodplain on the north bank of the River Wey between the town centre and Farncombe. From medieval times until the early 19th century, the area was managed as a hay meadow and, once the grass had been cut around Lammas Day (1 August), local residents were permitted to graze their cattle until Candlemas (1 February) the following year. These rights of common were extinguished in with the 1808 Act of Inclosure, but at least two of the dole stones, which formerly denoted individual plots of land, survive. Today the Lammas Lands are designated a Site of Nature Conservation Interest and are mostly owned by the borough council. A 1994 survey noted the presence of over 108 species of flowering plants, including black knapweed, meadow saxifrage, marsh marigold and water mint. Some 227 types of invertebrate were recorded in 2001, including populations of reed beetle on the banks of the Wey, whirligig beetle in Hell Ditch and click beetle in areas with taller grasses.

Holloway Hill Recreation Ground, originally known as Whitehart Field, was purchased by the Godalming Recreation Club Company in 1896. It has been used as a cricket field since before 1883 and, in 1885, sports being played there include football, quoits and tennis. During the First World War, the ground was dug up for allotments and in 1921 the town council bought the land from the company. Since June 2015, the ground has been protected by the charity Fields in Trust under their Queen Elizabeth II Fields scheme.

<doc id="213996" wikidata="Q836270" url="?curid=213996" title="Polygonal number">
<text>In mathematics, a polygonal number is a number that counts dots arranged in the shape of a regular polygon. These are one type of 2-dimensional figurate numbers.

Polygonal numbers were first studied during the 6th century BC by the Ancient Greeks, who investigated and discussed properties of oblong, triangular, and square numbers.

== Definition and examples ==

The number 10 for example, can be arranged as a triangle (see triangular number):

But 10 cannot be arranged as a square. The number 9, on the other hand, can be (see square number):

Some numbers, like 36, can be arranged both as a square and as a triangle (see square triangular number):

By convention, 1 is the first polygonal number for any number of sides. The rule for enlarging the polygon to the next size is to extend two adjacent arms by one point and to then add the required extra sides between those points. In the following diagrams, each extra layer is shown as in red.

===Triangular numbers===

The triangular number sequence is the representation of the numbers in the form of equilateral triangle arranged in a series or sequence. These numbers are in a sequence of 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, and so on.

===Square numbers===

Polygons with higher numbers of sides, such as pentagons and hexagons, can also be constructed according to this rule, although the dots will no longer form a perfectly regular lattice like above.

===Pentagonal numbers===

===Hexagonal numbers===

==Formula==
If is the number of sides in a polygon, the formula for the th -gonal number is

:formula_1

or
:formula_2

The th -gonal number is also related to the triangular numbers as follows:

:formula_3

Thus:

:formula_4

For a given -gonal number , one can find by

:formula_5

and one can find by

:formula_6.

===Every hexagonal number is also a triangular number===

Applying the formula above:
:formula_7

to the case of 6 sides gives:
:formula_8

but since:
:formula_9

it follows that:
:formula_10

This shows that the th hexagonal number is also the th triangular number . We can find every hexagonal number by simply taking the odd-numbered triangular numbers:

:1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66, ...

==Table of values==
The first 6 values in the column &quot;sum of reciprocals&quot;, for triangular to octagonal numbers, come from a published solution to the general problem, which also gives a general formula for any number of sides, in terms of the digamma function.
The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences eschews terms using Greek prefixes (e.g., &quot;octagonal&quot;) in favor of terms using numerals (i.e., &quot;8-gonal&quot;).

A property of this table can be expressed by the following identity (see ):

:formula_11

with

:formula_12

==Combinations==
Some numbers, such as 36 which is both square and triangular, fall into two polygonal sets. The problem of determining, given two such sets, all numbers that belong to both can be solved by reducing the problem to Pell&#x27;s equation. The simplest example of this is the sequence of square triangular numbers.

The following table summarizes the set of -gonal -gonal numbers for small values of and .

In some cases, such as and , there are no numbers in both sets other than 1.

The problem of finding numbers that belong to three polygonal sets is more difficult. A computer search for pentagonal square triangular numbers has yielded only the trivial value of 1, though a proof that there are no other such numbers has yet to be found.

The number 1225 is hecatonicositetragonal (), hexacontagonal (), icosienneagonal (), hexagonal, square, and triangular.

<doc id="214004" wikidata="Q181010" url="?curid=214004" title="Hard bop">
<text>Hard bop is a subgenre of jazz that is an extension of bebop (or &quot;bop&quot;) music. Journalists and record companies began using the term in the mid-1950s to describe a new current within jazz that incorporated influences from rhythm and blues, gospel music, and blues, especially in saxophone and piano playing.

David H. Rosenthal contends in his book &quot;Hard Bop&quot; that the genre is, to a large degree, the natural creation of a generation of African-American musicians who grew up at a time when bop and rhythm and blues were the dominant forms of black American music. Prominent hard bop musicians included Horace Silver, Clifford Brown, Charles Mingus, Art Blakey, Cannonball Adderley, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Hank Mobley, Thelonious Monk, Lee Morgan, Wes Montgomery, Pat Martino and others.

== Characteristics ==
Hard bop is sometimes referred to as &quot;funky hard bop&quot;. The &quot;funky&quot; label refers to the rollicking, rhythmic feeling associated with the style. The descriptor is also used to describe soul jazz, which is commonly associated with hard bop. According to Mark C. Gridley, soul jazz more specifically refers to music with &quot;an earthy, bluesy melodic concept and...repetitive, dance-like rhythms. Some listeners make no distinction between &#x27;soul-jazz&#x27; and &#x27;funky hard bop,&#x27; and many musicians don&#x27;t consider &#x27;soul-jazz&#x27; to be continuous with &#x27;hard bop.&#x27;&quot; The term &quot;soul&quot; suggests the church, and traditional gospel music elements such as &quot;amen chords&quot; (the plagal cadence) and triadic harmonies that seemed to suddenly appear in jazz during the era. Leroi Jones noted a combination of &quot;wider and harsher tones&quot; with &quot;accompanying piano chords [that] became more basic and simplified.&quot; He cited saxophonist Sonny Rollins&#x27; playing as one of the best examples of the style. Jazz critic Scott Yanow distinguished hard bop from the broader world of bop by saying that &quot;[t]empos could be just as blazing but the melodies were generally simpler, the musicians (particularly the saxophonists and pianists) tended to be familiar with (and open to the influence of) rhythm &amp; blues and the bass players (rather than always being stuck in the role of a metronome) were beginning to gain a little more freedom and solo space.&quot;

Hard bop has been seen by some critics as a response to cool jazz and West Coast jazz. As Paul Tanner, Maurice Gerow, and David Megill explain, &quot;the hard bop school...saw the new instrumentation and compositional devices used by cool musicians as gimmicks rather than valid developments of the jazz tradition.&quot; However, Shelly Manne suggested that cool jazz and hard bop simply reflected their respective geographic environments: the relaxed cool jazz style reflected a more relaxed lifestyle in California, while driving bop typified the New York scene. Some writers, such as James Lincoln Collier, suggest that the style was an attempt to recapture jazz as a form of African American expression. Whether or not this was the intent, many musicians quickly adopted the style, regardless of race.

== History ==

=== Origins ===

According to Nat Hentoff in his 1957 liner notes for the Art Blakey Columbia LP entitled &quot;Hard Bop&quot;, the phrase was originated by music critic and pianist John Mehegan, jazz reviewer of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; at that time. Hard bop first developed in the mid-1950s, and is generally seen as originating with the Jazz Messengers, a quartet led by pianist Horace Silver and drummer Art Blakey. Alternatively, Anthony Macias points to Detroit as an early center in the rise of bop and hard bop, noting Detroit musicians Barry Harris and Kenny Burrell and the fact Miles Davis lived in the city from 1953 to 1954. Billy Mitchell, a tenor saxophone player, organized a band that played at the Blue Bird Inn during the early 1950s that &quot;anchored the city&#x27;s Jazz scene&quot; and attracted hard bop musicians to the city.

Michael Cuscuna maintains that Silver and Blakey&#x27;s efforts were in response to the New York bebop scene:
Both Art and Horace were very, very aware of what they wanted to do. They wanted to get away from the jazz scene of the early &#x27;50s, which was the Birdland scene — you hire Phil Woods or Charlie Parker or J. J. Johnson, they come and sit in with the house rhythm section, and they only play blues and standards that everybody knows. There&#x27;s no rehearsal, there&#x27;s no thought given to the audience. Both Horace and Art knew that the only way to get the jazz audience back and make it bigger than ever was to really make music that was memorable and planned, where you consider the audience and keep everything short. They really liked digging into blues and gospel, things with universal appeal. So they put together what was to be called the Jazz Messengers.

David Rosenthal sees the development of hard bop as a response to both a decline in bebop and the rise of rhythm and blues:
The early fifties saw an extremely dynamic Rhythm and Blues scene take shape... This music, and not cool jazz, was what chronologically separated bebop and hard bop in ghettos. Young jazz musicians, of course, enjoyed and listened to these R &amp; B sounds which, among other things, began the amalgam of blues and gospel that would later be dubbed &#x27;soul music.&#x27; And it is in this vigorously creative black pop music, at a time when bebop seemed to have lost both its direction and its audience, that some of hard bop&#x27;s roots may be found.

A key recording in the early development of hard bop was Silver&#x27;s composition &quot;The Preacher&quot;, which was considered &quot;old-timey&quot; or &quot;corny&quot;, such that Blue Note head Alfred Lion was hesitant to record the song. However, the song became a successful hit.

Miles Davis, who had performed the title track of his album &quot;Walkin&#x27;&quot; at the inaugural Newport Jazz Festival in 1954, would form the Miles Davis Quintet with John Coltrane in 1955, becoming prominent in hard bop before moving on to other styles. Other early documents were the two volumes of the Blue Note albums &quot;A Night at Birdland&quot;, also from 1954, recorded by the Jazz Messengers at Birdland months before the Davis set at Newport. Clifford Brown, the trumpeter on the Birdland albums, formed the Brown-Roach Quintet with drummer Max Roach. Among the pianists in the band were Richie Powell and Carl Perkins, both of whom died at a young age.

=== Mainstream ===
David Ake notes that by the mid-1950s, &quot;the bop world clearly was not the &#x27;closed&#x27; circle it had been in its earliest days.&quot; This coincided with a competitive spirit among bop musicians to play with &quot;virtuousity and complexity,&quot; along with what Ake calls &quot;jazz masculinity.&quot; The broadening influence of hard bop coincided with a generation of jazz pianists who rose to prominence in the late 1950s – among them Tommy Flanagan, Kenny Drew, and Wynton Kelly – who took &quot;altered&quot; approaches to bebop. Although these musicians did not work exclusively or specifically within hard bop, their association with hard bop saxophone players put them within the genre&#x27;s broader circle. West Coast Jazz&#x27;s diminishing influence during the late 1950s accelerated hard bop&#x27;s rise to prominence, while the transition to 33-RPM records facilitated the shifts toward longer solos that were typical of hard bop albums. During a fifteen-year stretch from 1952 to 1967, Blue Note Records recruited musicians and promoted hard bop described by Yanow as &quot;classy.&quot;

A critical album that cemented hard bop&#x27;s mainstream presence in jazz was &quot;A Blowin&#x27; Session&quot; (1957), including saxophonists Johnny Griffin, John Coltrane, and Hank Mobley; trumpeter Lee Morgan; pianist Wynton Kelly; bassist Paul Chambers; and Art Blakey. Described by Al Campbell as &quot;one of the greatest hard bop jam sessions ever recorded&quot; and &quot;filled with infectious passion and camaraderie,&quot; it was the only studio session ever recorded including all three saxophonists. It cemented &quot;Coltrane&#x27;s ability to navigate complex chord changes over a fast tempo&quot; and is associated with Griffin&#x27;s reputation as &quot;the world&#x27;s fastest saxophonist.&quot;
In 1956, The Jazz Messengers recorded an album titled &quot;Hard Bop&quot;, which was released in 1957, including Bill Hardman on trumpet and saxophonist Jackie McLean, with a mix of hard bop compositions and jazz standards. Shortly after, in 1958, The Jazz Messengers, with a new line-up including Lee Morgan on trumpet and Benny Golson on saxophone, recorded the quintessential hard bop album &quot;Moanin&#x27;&quot;, with the album pioneering in soul jazz. Golson and Morgan formed their own bands and produced further records in the hard bop genre: Golson&#x27;s Jazztet with Art Farmer on trumpet recorded the album &quot;Meet the Jazztet&quot; in 1960, which was given a five-star rating by AllMusic, and Morgan explored hard bop and sister genres in records like &quot;The Sidewinder&quot;, known for its &quot;funky, danceable groov[e] that drew from soul-jazz, Latin boogaloo, blues, and R&amp;B.&quot; Morgan&#x27;s albums attracted rising stars in the jazz world, particularly saxophonists Joe Henderson and Wayne Shorter; Morgan formed a &quot;long-standing partnership&quot; with the latter.

Meanwhile, in the late 1950s to early 1960s John Coltrane was a prominent saxophonist within the hard bop genre, with albums such as &quot;Blue Train&quot; and &quot;Giant Steps&quot; exemplifying his ability to play within this style. His album &quot;Stardust&quot; (1958), for instance, included on trumpet a young Freddie Hubbard, who would go on to become &quot;a hard bop stylist.&quot; &quot;Blue Train&quot; was described by Richard Havers as &quot;Coltrane&#x27;s Hard-Bop Masterpiece,&quot; although an edit made to one of the album&#x27;s records caused controversy following disapproval from sound engineer Rudy Van Gelder. In the early to mid-1960s, prior to his death, Coltrane experimented in free jazz but again drew influences from hard bop in his 1965 album &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;. Coltrane was a longtime member of Miles Davis&#x27; band, which bridged the gap between hard bop and modal jazz with albums such as &quot;Milestones&quot; and &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;. These albums represented a transition toward more experimental jazz, but Davis maintained core ideas of hard bop, such as the &quot;call-and-response theme&quot; found on one of &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;&#x27;s best-known tracks, &quot;So What.&quot; The earlier album &quot;Milestones&quot; was described as &quot;indebted to hard bop&quot; due to its &quot;fast speeds, angular phrases and driving rhythms.&quot;

In the early 1960s, Joe Henderson formed a band with Kenny Dorham, which recorded for Blue Note Records, and played extensively as a sideman in the bands of Horace Silver and Herbie Hancock; however, he received less recognition after he moved to San Francisco and began recording for Milestone. Other hard bop musicians went to Europe, such as pianist Bud Powell (elder brother of Richie Powell) in 1959 and saxophonist Dexter Gordon in 1962. Powell, a bebop pianist, continued to record albums in the early 1960s, while Gordon&#x27;s &quot;Our Man in Paris&quot; became &quot;one of his most iconic albums&quot; for Blue Note.

Other musicians who contributed to the hard bop style include Donald Byrd, Tina Brooks, Sonny Clark, Lou Donaldson, Blue Mitchell, Sonny Rollins, and Sonny Stitt.

David Rosenthal considers six albums among the high points of the hard bop era: &quot;Ugetsu&quot;, &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;, &quot;Saxophone Colossus, Let Freedom Ring,&quot; &quot;Mingus Ah Um&quot;, and &quot;Brilliant Corners&quot;, referring to these as being some of the genre&#x27;s &quot;masterpieces.&quot;

=== Decline and revival ===
Scott Yanow described hard bop in the late 1960s as &quot;running out of gas.&quot; Blue Note Records&#x27; sale and decline in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combined with the rapid ascendance of soul jazz and fusion, largely replaced hard bop&#x27;s prevalence within jazz, although bop would see a major revival in the 1980s known as the Young Lions Movement. Yanow also attributes hard bop&#x27;s temporary decline in the 1970s to &quot;[t]he rise of commercial rock and the consolidation of most of the independent record labels.&quot; With rock groups such as The Beatles capturing hard bop&#x27;s charisma and avant-garde jazz, which had limited appeal outside jazz circles, bringing &quot;division and controversy into the jazz community,&quot; Davis and other former hard boppers left the genre, only for the new fusion genre to itself shrink within the next decade.

Davis led other jazz musicians toward the fusion genre, particularly other trumpet players. For example, Donald Byrd&#x27;s shift toward commercial fusion and smooth jazz recordings of the early 1970s, while celebrated within some circles, was considered a &quot;betrayal&quot; by fans of hard bop. His album &quot;Black Byrd&quot; (1973), Blue Note&#x27;s most successful album, neared #1 spot on the R&amp;B charts despite the opposition of jazz purists. However, in 1985, the filmed concert &quot;One Night with Blue Note&quot; brought together thirty predominantly hard bop musicians including Art Blakey, Ron Carter, Johnny Griffin, and Freddie Hubbard.

Following fusion&#x27;s decline, younger musicians started a bop revival, the best-known proponent of this being trumpeter Wynton Marsalis. The revival was a &quot;resurgence&quot; by the 1990s, and by the 1990s, hard bop&#x27;s revival had become so prominent that Yanow referred to it as &quot;the foundation of modern acoustic jazz.&quot;Joe Henderson, for instance, was described by Yanow as a &quot;national celebrity and a constant poll winner&quot; in jazz circles after signing for Verve in the 1990s, largely due to changes in marketing.

== Legacy ==
Rosenthal observed that &quot;[t]he years 1955 to 1965 represent the last period in which jazz effortlessly attracted the hippiest young black musicians, the most musically advanced, those with the most solid technical skills and the strongest sense of themselves, not only as entertainers but as artists.&quot; In the same text he laments hard bop&#x27;s &quot;many detractors and few articulate defenders,&quot; describing some of the comments made by its critics as &quot;derogatory cliches.&quot; Alternatively, Yanow suggests a slightly longer period, from 1955 to 1968, during which hard bop was &quot;the most dominant jazz style.&quot;

Although the hard bop style enjoyed its greatest popularity in the 1950s and 1960s, hard bop performers and elements of the music remain present in jazz.
