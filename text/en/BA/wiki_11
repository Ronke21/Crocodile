<text>The blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata) is a passerine bird in the family Corvidae, native to eastern North America. It lives in most of the eastern and central United States; some eastern populations may be migratory. Resident populations are also in Newfoundland, Canada; breeding populations are found across southern Canada. It breeds in both deciduous and coniferous forests, and is common in residential areas. Its coloration is predominantly blue, with a white chest and underparts, and a blue crest; it has a black, U-shaped collar around its neck and a black border behind the crest. Males and females are similar in size and plumage, which does not vary throughout the year. Four subspecies have been recognized.

The blue jay feeds mainly on seeds and nuts, such as acorns, which it may hide to eat later; soft fruits; arthropods; and occasionally small vertebrates. It typically gleans food from trees, shrubs, and the ground, and sometimes hawks insects from the air. Blue jays can be very aggressive to other birds; they sometimes raid nests and have even been found to have decapitated other birds.

It builds an open cup nest in the branches of a tree; both sexes participate. The clutch may be two to seven eggs, which are blueish or light brown with darker brown spots. Young are altricial, and are brooded by the female for 8–12 days after hatching. They may stay with their parents for one to two months.

The name &quot;jay&quot; derives from the bird&#x27;s noisy, garrulous nature and has been applied to other birds of the same family, which are also mostly gregarious. Jays are also called &quot;jaybirds&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The blue jay was first described as &quot;Pica glandaria cærulea cristata&quot; in English naturalist Mark Catesby&#x27;s 1731 publication of &quot;Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahamas&quot;. It was later described as &quot;Corvus cristatus&quot; in Carl Linnaeus&#x27; 1758 edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. In the 19th century, the jay was described by French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1838 as &quot;Cyanocorax cristatus&quot; in &quot;A geographical and comparative list of the birds of Europe and North America&quot;, and given its modern scientific name &quot;Cyanocitta cristata&quot; by Hugh Edwin Strickland in 1845. The genus name &quot;Cyanocitta&quot; derives from the Greek words &quot;kyaneos&quot; (blue) and the &quot;kitta&quot; and &quot;kissa&quot; (chattering bird, jay), and the term &quot;blue chatterer&quot; refers to the bright blue plumage of the head, nape, back, and tail of the bird. The specific name &quot;cristata&quot; (crested, tufted) derives from Latin referring to the prominent blue crest of the jay.

==Description==
The blue jay measures from bill to tail and weighs , with a wingspan of . Consistent with Bergmann&#x27;s rule, jays from Connecticut averaged in weight, while jays from warmer southern Florida averaged . There is a pronounced crest on the head, a crown of feathers, which may be raised or lowered according to the bird&#x27;s mood. When excited or aggressive, the crest will be fully raised. When frightened, the crest bristles outwards, brushlike. When the bird is feeding among other jays or resting, the crest is flattened on the head.

Its plumage is lavender-blue to mid-blue in the crest, back, wings, and tail, and its face is white. The underside is off-white and the neck is collared with black which extends to the sides of the head. The wing primaries and tail are strongly barred with black, sky-blue, and white. The bill, legs, and eyes are all black. Males and females are almost identical, but the male is slightly larger. The black plumage on its nape, face, and throat varies extensively between individuals; it is believed to assist in recognition between individuals.

As with most other blue-hued birds, the blue jay&#x27;s coloration is not derived from pigments but is the result of light interference due to the internal structure of the feathers; if a blue feather is crushed, the blue disappears because the structure is destroyed. The actual pigment in its feathers is melanin. This is referred to as structural coloration.

==Distribution and habitat==
The blue jay occurs from southern Canada and throughout the eastern and central United States south to Florida and northeastern Texas. The western edge of the range stops where the arid pine forest and scrub habitat of the closely related Steller&#x27;s jay (&quot;C. stelleri&quot;) begins, generally in the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Recently, the range of the blue jay has extended northwestwards so that it is now a rare but regularly seen winter visitor along the northern US and southern Canadian Pacific Coast. As the two species&#x27; ranges now overlap, &quot;C. cristata&quot; may sometimes hybridize with Steller&#x27;s Jay. The increase in trees throughout the Great Plains during the past century due to fire suppression and tree planting facilitated the western range expansion of the blue jay as well as range expansions of many other species of birds. From 1966 to 2015, the Blue Jay experienced a population decline along the Atlantic coast, but a greater than 1.5% annual population increase throughout the northern part of its range, including Labrador, Nova Scotia, southern Quebec, and southern Manitoba.

The northernmost subspecies &quot;C. c. bromia&quot; is, subject to necessity, migratory. It may withdraw several hundred kilometers south in the northernmost parts of its range. Thousands of blue jays have been observed to migrate in flocks along the Great Lakes and Atlantic coasts. It migrates during the daytime, in loose flocks of 5 to 250 birds. Much about their migratory behavior remains a mystery. Some are present throughout winter in all parts of their range. Young jays may be more likely to migrate than adults, but many adults also migrate. Some individual jays migrate south one year, stay north the next winter, and then migrate south again the next year. To date, no one has concretely worked out why they migrate when they do. Likely, it is related to weather conditions and how abundant the winter food sources are, which can determine whether other northern birds will move south.

The blue jay occupies a variety of habitats within its large range, from the pine woods of Florida to the spruce-fir forests of northern Ontario. It is less abundant in denser forests, preferring mixed woodlands with oaks and beeches. It has adapted to human activity very well, occurring in parks and residential areas, and can adapt to wholesale deforestation with relative ease if human activity creates other means for the jays to get by.

==Subspecies==
Four subspecies are generally accepted, though the variation within this species is rather subtle and essentially clinal. No firm boundaries can be drawn between the inland subspecies. The ranges of the coastal races are better delimited.

==Behavior==

The blue jay is a noisy, bold, and aggressive passerine. It is a moderately slow flier (roughly ) when unprovoked. It flies with body and tail held level, with slow wing beats.
Its slow flying speeds make this species easy prey for hawks and owls when it flies in open areas. Virtually all the raptorial birds sympatric in distribution with the blue jay may prey upon it, especially swift bird-hunting specialists such as the &quot;Accipiter&quot; hawks. Diverse predators may prey on jay eggs and young up to their fledgling stage, including tree squirrels, snakes, cats, crows, raccoons, opossums, other jays and possibly many of the same birds of prey who attack adults.

The blue jay can be beneficial to other bird species, as it may chase predatory birds, such as hawks and owls, and will scream if it sees a predator within its territory. It has also been known to sound an alarm call when hawks or other dangers are near, and smaller birds often recognize this call and hide themselves away accordingly. It may occasionally impersonate the calls of raptors, especially those of the red-tailed and red-shouldered hawks, possibly to test whether a hawk is in the vicinity, though also possibly to scare off other birds that may compete for food sources. It may also be aggressive towards humans who come close to its nest, and if an owl roosts near the nest during the daytime the blue jay mobs it until it takes a new roost. However, blue jays have also been known to attack or kill other smaller birds, and foliage-roosting bat species such as Eastern red bats. Jays are very territorial birds, and they will chase others from a feeder for an easier meal. Additionally, the blue jay may raid other birds&#x27; nests, stealing eggs, chicks, and nests. However, this may not be as common as is typically thought, as only 1% of food matter in one study was bird material. Despite this, other passerines may still mob jays who come within their breeding territories.

When a blue jay is agitated or angry, the blue crest atop its head will rise. It will lower when the bird is relaxed or calm.

Blue jays, like other corvids, are highly curious and are considered intelligent birds. Young individuals playfully snatch brightly colored or reflective objects, such as bottle caps or pieces of aluminum foil, and carry them around until they lose interest. While not confirmed to have engaged in tool use in the wild, blue jays in captivity have been observed using strips of newspaper as tools to obtain food, while captive fledglings have been observed attempting to open the doors of their cages.

==Diet==

Blue jays are omnivorous, but the Audubon Society estimates that 75% of their diet is vegetable matter. They have strong black bills which they use for cracking nuts, usually while holding them with their feet, and for eating corn, grains and seeds. Blue jays particularly love to eat peanuts in the shell. Its food is sought both on the ground and in trees and includes virtually all known types of plant and animal sources, such as acorns and beech mast, weed seeds, grain, fruit, and other berries, peanuts, bread, meat, small invertebrates of many types, scraps in town parks, bird-table food and rarely eggs and nestlings. Blue jays will sometimes cache food, though to what extent differs widely among individuals. Although seemingly contentious in their general behavior, blue jays are frequently subservient to other medium-sized birds who visit bird feeders. In Florida, blue jays were dominated at feeders by eastern gray squirrels, Florida scrub jays, common grackles, and red-headed woodpeckers, all of which were occasionally observed to aggressively prevent the jays from feeding.

==Reproduction==
The mating season begins in mid-March, peaks in mid-April to May, and extends into July. Any suitable tree or large bush may be used for nesting, though an evergreen is preferred. The nest is preferentially built at a height in the trees of . It is cup-shaped and composed of twigs, small roots, bark strips, moss, other plant material, cloth, paper, and feathers, with occasional mud added to the cup.

Blue jays are not very picky about nesting locations. If no better place is available – such as in a heavily deforested area – they will even use places like the large mailboxes typical of the rural United States. They also appropriate nests of other mid-sized songbirds as long as these are placed in suitable spots; American robin nests are commonly used by blue jays, for example.

Blue jays typically form monogamous pair bonds for life. Both sexes build the nest and rear the young, though only the female broods them. The male feeds the female while she is brooding the eggs. There are usually between 3 and 6 (averaging 4 or 5) eggs laid and incubated over 16–18 days. The young fledge usually between 17 and 21 days after hatching.

After the juveniles fledge, the family travels and forages together until early fall, when the young birds disperse to avoid competition for food during the winter. Sexual maturity is reached after one year of age. The oldest known wild, banded Blue Jay was at least 26 years, 11 months old when it was found dead after being caught in fishing gear. It had been banded in the Newfoundland/Labrador/Saint-Pierre et Miquelon area in 1989 and was found there in 2016. Another wild jay was found to have been around years old. A more common lifespan for wild birds that survive to adulthood is around 7 years. Beyond predation and the occasional collision with man-made objects, a common cause of mortality in recent decades has been the West Nile virus, to which corvids as a whole seem especially susceptible. However, despite several major local declines, overall blue jays have not seemed to have been depleted by the disease.

==Vocalizations==
Blue jays can make a large variety of sounds, and individuals may vary perceptibly in their calling style. Like other corvids, they may learn to mimic human speech. Blue jays can also copy the cries of local hawks so well that it is sometimes difficult to tell which it is. Their voice is typical of most jays in being varied, but the most commonly recognized sound is the alarm call, which is a loud, almost gull-like scream. There is also a high-pitched &quot;jayer-jayer&quot; call that increases in speed as the bird becomes more agitated. This particular call can be easily confused with the chickadee&#x27;s song because of the slow-starting &quot;chick-ah-dee-ee&quot;. Blue jays will use these calls to band together to mob potential predators such as hawks and drive them away from the jays&#x27; nests.

Blue jays also have quiet, less noticeable calls which they use among themselves in proximity. One of the most distinctive calls of this type is often referred to as the &quot;rusty pump&quot; owing to its squeaky resemblance to the sound of an old hand-operated water pump. The blue jay (and other corvids) are distinct from most other songbirds for using their call as a song.

==In human culture==

===Fiction and folklore===
In old African-American folktales of the southern United States, the blue jay was a significant metaphysical creature. In some tales, the blue jay was credited with making the earth &quot;when all de worl&#x27; was water&quot; by bringing the first &quot;grit&quot; or &quot;dirt.&quot; In other tales the blue jay was temporarily conscripted as a servant of the devil and would not be seen on Friday as it was gathering twigs to furnish hell&#x27;s kindling and give fire to wicked men on Earth; relieved from duty on Saturday, its song for the day was abundant and joyous.

An anthropomorphic blue jay named Mordecai is one of the main characters of the Cartoon Network animated television series &quot;Regular Show&quot;.

===Mascots and symbols===
The blue jay is the provincial bird of the province of Prince Edward Island in Canada.

The blue jay is also the official mascot for Johns Hopkins University, Elmhurst University, and Creighton University.

The blue jay was adopted as the team symbol of the Toronto Blue Jays Major League Baseball team, as well as some of their minor league affiliates. Their mascot, Ace, is an anthropomorphic blue jay.

<text>Prince of Persia is a 1989 cinematic platform game developed and published by Broderbund for the Apple II. It was designed and implemented by Jordan Mechner. Taking place in medieval Persia, players control an unnamed protagonist who must venture through a series of dungeons to defeat the evil Grand Vizier Jaffar and save an imprisoned princess.

Much like &quot;Karateka&quot;, Mechner&#x27;s first video game, &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; used rotoscoping for its fluid and realistic animation. For this process, Mechner used as reference for the characters&#x27; movements videos of his brother doing acrobatic stunts in white clothes and swashbuckler films such as &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;.

The game was critically acclaimed and, while not an immediate commercial success, sold many copies as it was ported to a wide range of platforms after the original Apple II release. It is believed to have been the first cinematic platformer and inspired many games in this subgenre, such as &quot;Another World&quot;. Its success launched the &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; franchise, consisting of two sequels, &quot;Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame&quot; (1993) and &quot;Prince of Persia 3D&quot; (1999), and two reboots: &quot;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time&quot; (2003), which was followed by three sequels of its own, and &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; (2008).

==Gameplay==

The main objective of the player is to lead the unnamed protagonist out of dungeons and into a fortress tower before time runs out. This cannot be done without bypassing traps and fighting hostile swordsmen. The game consists of twelve levels (though some console versions have more). However, a game session may be saved and resumed at a later time only after level 2.

The player has a health indicator that consists of a series of small red triangles. The player starts with three. Each time the protagonist is damaged (cut by sword, fallen from two floors of heights, or hit by a falling rock), the player loses one of these indicators. There are small jars containing potions of several colors and sizes. The red potions scattered throughout the game restore one health indicator. The blue potions are poisonous, and they take one life indicator as damage. There are also large jars of red potion that increase the maximum number of health indicators by one, and large jars of green potion that grants a temporary ability to hover. In level 9 there are also two large green potions, one which turns the game display upside-down, and another to restore the display back to normal. If the player&#x27;s health is reduced to zero, the protagonist dies. Subsequently, the game is restarted from the beginning of the level in which the protagonist died but the timer will not reset to that point, effectively constituting a time penalty. There is no counter for the number of lives, but if time runs out, the princess will be gone and the game will be over, with exceptions below.

There are three types of traps that the player must bypass: spike traps, deep pits (three or more stories deep) and guillotines. Getting caught or falling into each results in the instant death of the protagonist. In addition, there are gates that can be raised for a short period of time by having the protagonist stand on the activation trigger. The player must pass through the gates while they are still open, avoiding locking triggers. Sometimes, there are various traps between an unlock trigger and a gate.

Hostile swordsmen (Jaffar and his guards) are yet another obstacle. The player obtains a sword in level 1, which they can use to fight these adversaries. The protagonist&#x27;s sword maneuvers are as follows: advance, back off, slash, parry, or a combined parry-then-slash attack. Enemy swordsmen also have a health indicator similar to that of the protagonist. Killing them involves slashing them until their health indicator is depleted or by pushing them into traps while fighting.

In level 3 a skeletal swordsman comes to life and does battle with the protagonist. The skeleton cannot be killed with the sword, but it can be defeated by being dropped into one of the pits.

A unique trap encountered in level 4, which serves as a plot device, is a magic mirror, whose appearance is followed by an ominous leitmotif. The protagonist is forced to jump through this mirror upon which his doppelganger emerges from the other side, draining the protagonist&#x27;s health to one. This apparition later hinders the protagonist by stealing a potion in level 5 and throwing him from level 6 into a dungeon in level 7.

In level 8, the protagonist becomes trapped behind a gate before he can reach the exit. In this level the Princess sends a white mouse to trigger the gate open again, allowing him to proceed to level 9.

In level 12 the protagonist faces his shadow doppelgänger. The protagonist cannot kill this apparition as they share lives; any damage inflicted upon one also hurts the other. Therefore, the protagonist must merge with his doppelganger. Once they have merged, the player can run across an invisible bridge to a new area, where they battle Jaffar. Once the final checkpoint is reached, the player will no longer get a game over screen even if time runs out. (See below.) Once Jaffar is defeated, his spell is broken and the Princess can be saved. In addition, the in-game timer is stopped at the moment of Jaffar&#x27;s death, and the time remaining will appear on the high scores.
* The DOS and Macintosh ports will not give the player a game over once they reach the final area of level 12 (stored in data as level 13), provided they make it there on time. The player must cross the magic bridge and make a screen-transition to a room with falling tiles to be &#x27;safe&#x27;. Running out of time at any point before the screen-transition, including the bridge, will result in game over as usual in both ports.
**Once there in the Macintosh port, they will always be allowed to continue, regardless of deaths or time expiration.
** The &quot;overtime&quot; in the DOS version has no extra life, so:
# Pressing Control A to restart level 13 is no death, thus not failing the game yet.
# Any player&#x27;s death fails the game so the Princess is also gone even if Jaffar is already killed.
# Only defeating Jaffar and exiting level 13 alive will save the Princess, with a negative time on the high scores.
* The Super NES remake allows the players to save themselves after time is out, to get the &quot;game over&quot; at the end without the princess saved, as opposed to &quot;the end&quot; announced for good ending.

==Plot==
The game is set in medieval Persia. While the sultan is fighting a war in a foreign land, his vizier Jaffar, a wizard, seizes power. His only obstacle to the throne is the Sultan&#x27;s daughter. Jaffar locks her in a tower and orders her to become his wife, or she would die within 60 minutes (extended to 120 minutes in the Super NES version, which has longer and harder levels). The game&#x27;s unnamed protagonist, whom the Princess loves, is thrown prisoner into the palace dungeons. In order to free her, he must escape the dungeons, get to the palace tower and defeat Jaffar before time runs out. In addition to guards, various traps and dungeons, the protagonist is further hindered by his own doppelgänger, conjured out of a magic mirror.

==Development==

Development for the game began in 1985, the year Jordan Mechner graduated from Yale University. At that time, Mechner had already developed one game, &quot;Karateka&quot;, for distributor Broderbund. Despite expecting a sequel to &quot;Karateka&quot;, the distributor gave Mechner creative freedom to create an original game. The game drew from sources of inspiration including video games such as &quot;The Castles of Dr. Creep&quot; and &quot;Lode Runner&quot;, literature such as the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; stories, and films such as &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;.
&quot;Prince of Persia&quot; was programmed in 6502 assembly, a low-level programming language. Mechner used an animation technique called rotoscoping, with which he used footage to animate the characters&#x27; sprites and movements. To create the protagonist&#x27;s platforming motions, Mechner traced video footage of his younger brother running and jumping in white clothes. To create the game&#x27;s sword fighting sprites, Mechner rotoscoped the final duel scene between Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone in &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;. Though the use of rotoscoping was regarded as a pioneering move, Mechner later recalled that &quot;when we made that decision with &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;, I wasn&#x27;t thinking about being cutting edge — we did it essentially because I&#x27;m not that good at drawing or animation, and it was the only way I could think of to get lifelike movement.&quot; Also unusual was the method of combat: protagonist and enemies fought with swords, not projectile weapons, as was the case in most contemporary games. Mechner has said that when he started programming, the first ten minutes of the film &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; had been one of the main inspirations for the character&#x27;s acrobatic responses in a dangerous environment.

During development, the Prince was meant to be a nonviolent character, so the game did not initially include combat. However, due to finding the gameplay to be dull and after incessant demand from Tomi Pierce, a colleague of his, Mechner added sword fighting to the game and created Shadow Man, the Prince&#x27;s doppelgänger. Guards were later added when Mechner managed to make use of an additional 12K of the Apple II&#x27;s memory.

Mechner was offended by the cover art for the Sega Genesis version, which depicts the prince as a Luke Skywalker lookalike about to cut down a helpless black guard, but by the time he made his objections it was already being printed.

For the Japanese computer ports, Arsys Software and Riverhillsoft enhanced the visuals and redesigned the Prince&#x27;s appearance, introducing the classic turban and vest look. This version became the basis for the Macintosh version and later &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; ports and games by Broderbund. Riverhillsoft&#x27;s FM Towns version also added a Red Book CD audio soundtrack.

The Amiga version of the game was developed by Dan Gorlin. Tommy Tallarico worked on the audio for the Game Boy port of the game, and it was the first game he worked on. He originally started as a playtester for Virgin Interactive.

The game included anti-piracy protection in the form of a second level, where you had to drink the correct bottle according to the manual.

The PC game later received three updates: version 1.1 had minor fixes, in version 1.3 the colors of the walls in some levels were changed (instead of blue walls, level 3 was green, 8th and 9th were gray, and 12th was yellow) and a program for graphics and sound settings was added, version 1.4 contains the same color scheme as the previous one, but the sound could only be set to Sound Blaster or PC speaker and the graphics could not be set to older than VGA.

==Reception==
&quot;Prince of Persia&quot; received a positive critical reception, but was initially a commercial failure in North America, where it had sold only 7,000 units each on the Apple II and IBM PC by July 1990. It was when the game was released in Japan and Europe that year that it became a commercial success. In July 1990, the NEC PC-9801 version sold 10,000 units as soon as it was released in Japan. It was then ported to various different home computers and video game consoles, eventually selling 2 million units worldwide by the time its sequel &quot;Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame&quot; (1993) was in production.

Charles Ardai of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; wrote that the game package&#x27;s claim that it &quot;breaks new ground with animation so uncannily human it must be seen to be believed&quot; was true. He wrote that &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; &quot;succeeds at being more than a running-jumping game (in other words, a gussied-up Nintendo game)&quot; because it &quot;captures the &quot;feel&quot; of those great old adventure films&quot;, citing &quot;Thief of Baghdad&quot;, &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, and &quot;Dracula&quot;. Ardai concluded that it was &quot;a tremendous achievement&quot; in games comparable to that of &quot;Star Wars&quot; in film.

In 1991, the game was ranked the 12th best Amiga game of all time by &quot;Amiga Power&quot;. In 1992, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the Macintosh version as having &quot;brilliant&quot; graphics and &quot;excellent&quot; sound. Reviewing the Genesis version, &quot;GamePro&quot; praised the &quot;extremely fluid&quot; animation of the player character and commented that the controls are difficult to master but nonetheless very effective. Comparing it to the Super NES version, they summarized that &quot;the Genesis version has better graphics, and the SNES has better music. Otherwise, the two are identical in almost every way ...&quot; &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (&quot;EGM&quot;) likewise assessed the Genesis version as &quot;an excellent conversion of the classic action game&quot;, and added that the game&#x27;s challenging strategy and technique give it high longevity. &quot;EGM&quot;″s panel of four reviewers each gave it a rating of 8 out of 10, adding up to an overall score of 32 out of 40.

In 1991, &quot;PC Format&quot; named &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; one of the 50 best computer games ever, highlighting its &quot;unbelievably good animation&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; named &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; the 84th best game ever, with the editors calling it &quot;an acrobatic platformer with amazingly fluid action&quot;. In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; ranked the game 42nd on their Top 100 Video Games.

==Legacy==
&quot;Prince of Persia&quot; influenced cinematic platformers such as &quot;Another World&quot; and &quot;Flashback&quot; as well as action-adventure games such as &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, which used a similar control scheme. A few DOS games were created using exactly the same game mechanics of the DOS version of &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;. Makh-Shevet created &quot;Cruel World&quot; in 1993 and Capstone Software created &quot;Zorro&quot; in 1995.

&quot;Prince of Persia&quot; was remade and ported by Gameloft. The remake, titled &quot;Prince of Persia Classic&quot;, was released on June 13, 2007, to the Xbox Live Arcade, and on October 23, 2008, on the PlayStation Network. It features the same level design and general premise but contained 3D-rendered graphics, more fluid movements, and &quot;Sands of Time&quot; aesthetics. The gameplay and controls were slightly adjusted to include a wall-jump move and different swordplay. New game modes were also added, such as &quot;Time Attack&quot; and &quot;Survival&quot;. The game has also been released on Android.

Reverse engineering efforts by fans of the original game have resulted in detailed documentation of the file formats of the MS-DOS version. Various level editors have been created that can be used to modify the level files of the game. With these editors and other software, over 60 mods have been created.

In April 2012, Jordan Mechner established a GitHub repository containing the long-thought-lost original Apple II source code for &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;. A technical document describing the operation of this source code is available on Mechner&#x27;s website.

In April 2020, Mechner did an AMA on Reddit where he stated that he would be releasing his journals from the development of the game as a book and users could ask any questions that they may have about the game to him.

<text>Tecmo Super Bowl is an American football video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) that was released in December 1991. Developed by Tecmo, it is the first sports video game that was licensed by both the National Football League and the National Football League Players Association, thus allowing the game to use both the names and attributes of real NFL teams and real NFL players. Prior games use either the real teams, the real players, or fictional substitutes, but not real teams and real players together.

The game was a major success, resulting in several follow-ups for subsequent game consoles. The NES original has had an extensive cult following across the decades, with widely covered tournaments as the game modification community provides annual roster updates. It has been variously named as one of the best NES games, one of the best sports games, and one of the most influential video games of all time.

== Overview ==
With &quot;Tecmo Bowl&quot; for NES in 1989, Tecmo had procured an official license from the National Football League Players Association, providing twelve teams and a truncated roster. The full NFL team license was unavailable because of the exclusive license held for another NES game, &quot;NFL&quot; published by LJN. The success of &quot;Tecmo Bowl&quot; was followed by the release of &quot;Tecmo Super Bowl&quot; in 1991 in North America and Japan, for which Tecmo acquired both sets of the NFL/NFLPA licenses, making it the first and only NES game to feature both real NFL teams and players. Although the game was released in late 1991, all team rosters and player attributes are from the prior 1990–91 NFL season, so it contains no rookies taken in the 1991 NFL draft and no player team changes executed before the start of the 1991 season.

&quot;Tecmo Super Bowl&quot; surpasses its predecessor with the complete 1991 league of 28 teams, expanded rosters, expanded playbooks, and statistical tracking including NFL records. Jim Kelly, Randall Cunningham, and Bernie Kosar are represented by generic names of QB Bills, QB Eagles, and QB Browns, respectively, because the players were not members of the NFLPA&#x27;s marketing contract. This gameplay foundation would be expanded upon during the course of the series&#x27; run.

== Gameplay ==
==Reception==
In the United States, &quot;Tecmo Super Bowl&quot; topped Babbage&#x27;s NES sales charts for three months in 1992, from October to December. At a retail price of $54.99 (), it was the most expensive NES game released to date.

In 1997, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; and &quot;IGN&quot; each named &quot;Tecmo Super Bowl&quot; as one of the top 100 video games of all time. IGN ranked &quot;Tecmo Super Bowl&quot; number 53 in its top 100 NES games. GamesRadar ranked it number 22 in its list of the best NES games, noting that it may be the only football game from the NES still widely played. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; ranked the game number 10 in its list of the ten most-influential video games of all time. ESPN named &quot;Tecmo Super Bowl&quot; the greatest sports video game of all time.

==Legacy==
===Sequels and related games===
Tecmo produced several direct sequels to &quot;Tecmo Super Bowl&quot;, and other games originating with the &quot;Tecmo Bowl&quot; engine. 16-bit versions of &quot;Tecmo Super Bowl&quot; for the Super NES and Genesis were released in 1993 (reflecting the rosters and attributes for that season), which fixed many bugs and added some new features. New features include these: improved game graphics and sound; official NFL team logos in the end zones; user-controlled touchbacks; the ability to control a player to attempt a punt block; the in-game option to change plays in a team&#x27;s playbook during games; a running back &quot;dive play&quot; option; a designated return team that includes defensive backs; statistical achievements during games; and three weather conditions (sunny, rain and snow), which can occur randomly in Season mode. Accelerated fifteen-minute and ten-minute quarters can only be used for Exhibition and Pro Bowl games. The game can play three consecutive seasons (1991–1993). Sequels to these versions, &quot;Tecmo Super Bowl II: Special Edition&quot; and &quot;Tecmo Super Bowl III: Final Edition&quot;, were released in subsequent years for the Super NES and Genesis. These were followed by &quot;Tecmo Super Bowl&quot; for the PlayStation in 1996.

&quot;Tecmo Super Bowl&quot; for the PlayStation sports new features such as a new player editor which can make unlimited amounts of unrestricted trades, change jersey numbers, edit player attributes, edit names, and swap player portraits. It has a play-by-play announcer voice. Offenses can pick a formation before selecting a particular play. The game has alternate camera angles, instant replay, and the option to adjust AI difficulty in regular season games. This is the last entry in the series to have the NFL and NFLPA licenses, and reflected the rosters and attributes of the 1996 season.

A Sega Saturn version was in development, but was never released. Subsequent entries, such as 2008&#x27;s &quot;Tecmo Bowl: Kickoff&quot; for the Nintendo DS, and 2010&#x27;s &quot;Tecmo Bowl Throwback&quot; for the Xbox 360 and PS3 feature generic players and teams, due to Electronic Arts obtaining the exclusive NFL and NFLPA licenses in 2004 for the Madden NFL series.

===Cult following===
Since the advent of modern console emulation on computers, &quot;Tecmo Super Bowl&quot; is one of the most modified NES games. This contributes greatly to its cult following as it is constantly updated with rosters for college and professional football. Numerous websites are dedicated to pickup games, online leagues, and message boards for the original game and its mods. In 2016, popularity spiked with 26 national tournaments, Tecmo Madison XIII&#x27;s livestream having 161,076 viewers, and ESPN.com providing coverage.

An episode of &quot;NFL Films Presents&quot; documents the video game and its cult following. Centering on the annual world championship tournament in Madison, Wisconsin, the episode includes interviews with NFL greats such as Emmitt Smith and Christian Okoye who are featured in the original game, and modern NFL players such as Philip Rivers who discuss their passion for the game.

===In popular culture===
Gameplay is featured in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Run, Chris, Run&quot;, where Peter uses Bo Jackson to beat Quagmire.

&quot;Tecmo Bowl&quot; is a central theme for two 2016 Kia Sorento commercials, starring Bo Jackson and playing off his ridiculously advantageous in-game characteristics. One features Brian Bosworth, who had been famously run over by Jackson during a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game in 1987 as he attempted to score a touchdown.

<text>A converso (; ; feminine form conversa), &quot;convert&quot; (), was a Jew who converted to Catholicism in Spain or Portugal, particularly during the 14th and 15th centuries, or one of their descendants.

To safeguard the Old Christian population and make sure that the &quot;converso&quot; &quot;New Christians&quot; were true to their new faith, the Holy Office of the Inquisition was established in Spain in 1478. The Catholic Monarchs of Spain Ferdinand and Isabella expelled the remaining openly practising Jews by the Alhambra Decree of 1492, following the Christian &quot;Reconquista&quot; (reconquest) of Spain. However, a significant proportion of these remaining practising Jews chose to join the already large &quot;converso&quot; community rather than face exile.

&quot;Conversos&quot; who did not fully or genuinely embrace Catholicism, but continued to practise Judaism in secrecy, were referred to as &quot;judaizantes&quot; &quot;Judaizers&quot; and pejoratively as &quot;marranos&quot;.

New Christian converts of Muslim origin were known as &quot;moriscos&quot;. Unlike Jewish &quot;conversos&quot;, &quot;moriscos&quot; were subject to an edict of expulsion even after their conversion to Catholicism, which was implemented severely in Valencia and in Aragón and less so in other parts of Spain.

&quot;Conversos&quot; played a vital role in the 1520–1521 Revolt of the Comuneros, a popular uprising in the Crown of Castile against the rule of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor.

== History ==
Ferrand Martínez, Archdeacon of Écija, directed a 13-year anti-Jewish campaign that began in 1378. Martínez used a series of provocative sermons, through which he openly condemned the Jews with little to no opposition. He rallied non-Jews against the Jews, creating a constant state of fear through riots. Martínez&#x27;s efforts led to a series of outbreaks of violence on 4 June 1391, where several synagogues in Seville were burned to the ground and churches were erected in their place. Amidst this outbreak, many Jews fled the country, some converted to Christianity in fear, and some were sold to Muslims. Martínez set in motion the largest forced mass conversion of Jews in Spain.

Both the Church and the Crown had not anticipated such a large-scale conversion stemming from the unplanned anti-Semitic campaign led by Martínez. The new converts represented a new problem. Their conversion temporarily resolved the friction between the Christian and Jewish populations in Spain; however, it led to the creation of a new group that was neither completely Catholic nor Jewish and new tensions resulted.

&quot;Conversos&quot;, who were now fully privileged citizens, competed in all aspects of the economic sphere. This resulted in a new wave of racial anti-Semitism that targeted &quot;conversos&quot;. This anti-Semitism evolved into small and large riots in Toledo, 1449, that now oppressed not Jews by Christians, but New Christians (&quot;conversos&quot;) by the Old Christians. Thus, the Crown established an office of the Inquisition in 1478, monitored the religious loyalty a newly-baptized Christian (&quot;converso&quot;). Such religious surveillance continued to the descendants of converts. Often due to continued oppression, some Jews and &quot;conversos&quot; fled Spain, going to Portugal, then when the Portuguese crown instituted similar anti-Jewish policies as Spain&#x27;s, they migrated particularly for the Netherlands. Others created crypto-Jewish communities to ensure the survival of Judaism in the Iberian Peninsula, although outwardly practicing Christianity.

== Perpetuation of Jewish heritage ==
&quot;Conversas&quot; played a pivotal role in keeping Jewish traditions alive by observing many Jewish holidays such as Shabbat. They prepared traditional Jewish dishes in honor of the Sabbath (starting on Friday sundown), Yom Kippur, and other religious holidays. During festivals such as Sukkot and Passover, &quot;Conversas&quot; participated by giving clothing articles and ornaments to Jewish women, attending a &quot;seder&quot;, or obtaining a baking matzah. &quot;Conversas&quot; ensured that their household maintained similar dietary regulations as their Jewish counterparts, by eating only kosher birds and other animals. These women also financially contributed to the growth of the Jewish/Converso community and synagogue. The Jewish community and &quot;conversos&quot; exchanged books and knowledge, Jews taught &quot;conversos&quot; how to read to ensure constant growth of their Jewish heritage. To take a stance against the church and its principles, some conversos performed professional work even on Sundays.

The traditional Jewish Purim was kept by &quot;conversos&quot; still adhering to Jewish observances in the disguise of a Christian holiday, they named it &quot;Festival of Santa Esterica&quot;.

==Description==

&quot;Conversos&quot; were subject to suspicion and harassment from both what was left of the community they were leaving and that which they were joining. Both Christians and Jews called them &quot;tornadizo&quot; (renegade). James I, Alfonso X and John I passed laws forbidding the use of this epithet. This was part of a larger pattern of royal oversight, as laws were promulgated to protect their property, forbid attempts to convert them back to Judaism or the Muslim faith, and regulate their behaviour, preventing their cohabitation or even dining with Jews, lest they convert back.

Conversos did not enjoy legal equality. Alfonso VII prohibited the &quot;recently converted&quot; from holding office in Toledo. They had supporters and bitter opponents in the Christian secular of general acceptance, yet they became targets of occasional pogroms during times of social tension (as during an epidemic and after an earthquake). They were subject to the Spanish and Portuguese inquisitions.

While &quot;pure blood&quot; (so-called &quot;limpieza de sangre&quot;), free of the &quot;taint&quot; of non-Christian lineage, would come to be placed at a premium, particularly among the nobility, in a 15th-century defence of &quot;conversos&quot;, Bishop Lope de Barrientos would list what Roth calls &quot;a veritable &#x27;Who&#x27;s Who&#x27; of Spanish nobility&quot; as having &quot;converso&quot; members or being of &quot;converso&quot; descent. He pointed out that given the near-universal conversion of Iberian Jews during Visigothic times, (quoting Roth) &quot;[W]ho among the Christians of Spain could be certain that he is not a descendant of those &quot;conversos&quot;?&quot;

With advances in science able to trace individuals&#x27; ancestry via their DNA, according to a widely publicised study (December 2008) in the &quot;American Journal of Human Genetics&quot;, modern Spaniards (and Portuguese) have an average admixture of 19.8 percent from ancestors originating in the Near East during historic times (i.e. Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Jews and Levantine Arabs) – compared to 10.6 percent of North African – Berber admixture. This proportion could be as high as 23% in the case of Latin Americans, however, according to a study published in &quot;Nature Communications&quot;. The possibly higher proportion of significant Jewish ancestry in the Latin American population could stem from increased emigration of Conversos to the New World to avoid persecution by the Spanish Inquisition.

== By country ==
=== In Spain ===
The Chuetas are a current social group on the Spanish island of Majorca, in the Mediterranean Sea, who are descendants of Majorcan Jews that either were conversos (forcible converts to Christianity) or were Crypto-Jews, forced to keep their religion hidden. They practiced strict endogamy by marrying only within their own group.

The Chuetas has been stigmatized up until today in Balearic Islands. In the latter part of the 20th century, the spread of freedom of religion and laïcité reduced both the social pressure and community ties. An estimated 18,000 people in the island carry Chueta surnames in the 21st century. Traditionally, The church of Saint Eulalia and the church of Montesión (Mount Zion) in Palma de Mallorca have been used by the families of Jewish converts (Xuetas).

All this, however, does not imply the complete elimination of rejection behaviors, as indicated by a survey carried out among Majorcans by the University of the Balearic Islands in 2001, in which 30% stated that they would never marry a Chueta and 5% declared that they do not even want to have Chueta friends.

=== In Italy ===
Specific groups of conversos left Spain and Portugal after the Spanish Inquisition in 1492, in search for a better life. They left for other parts of Europe, especially Italy, where they were inevitably looked at with suspicion and harassment, both in their old and new communities. Subsequently, many conversos who arrived in Italian cities did not openly embrace their Judaism, since they were tempted by the advantages they could seek in the Christian world.

The first three cities to accept the conversos who openly converted back to Judaism, were Florence, Ferrara, and Ancona. Most of these conversos appeared after 1536 from Portugal, and most lived in Florence. In 1549, Duke Cosimo de&#x27; Medici allowed the Portuguese conversos to trade and reside within Florence. Most of the re-converted Jews lived in the ghetto of Florence, and by 1705 there were 453 Jews in the city.

Conversos arrived to Ferrara in 1535, and were able to assimilate with their neighbours, perform circumcisions, and return openly to Judaism, due to the Lettres Patentes issued by Duke Ercole II. After the plague in 1505 and the eventual fall of Ferrara in 1551, many of these Jews relocated North towards the economically stable ports in Venice. Venice slowly became a center for conversos who either stopped temporarily on their way to Turkey or stayed permanently as residents in the ghetto Jewish community port. Venetian leaders were convinced to openly accept conversos to practice Judaism because they recognised that if conversos were not welcome in Venice, they would take their successful trades to the country&#x27;s economic rival of Turkey. A Portuguese converso in Venice, named Abraham de Almeda, connected strongly with Christianity, however, turned to the Jewish members of his family when in need of financing for moral support. As a result, many of the conversos during this period struggled with their Christian and Jewish identities.

Conversos in the city of Ancona faced difficult lives living under the pope and eventually fled to Ferrara in 1555. Portuguese conversos in Ancona were falsely misled that they were welcome to Ancona and that they could openly convert back to Judaism. Their fate was overturned by the succeeding pope, Pope Paul IV. The conversos in Ancona faced traumatic emotional damage after the pope imprisoned 102 conversos who refused to reside in the ghetto and wear badges to distinguish themselves. In 1588, when the duke granted a charter of residence in return for the conversos building up the city&#x27;s economy, they refused, due to accumulated scepticism.

<text>In programming language theory, subtyping (also called subtype polymorphism or inclusion polymorphism) is a form of type polymorphism. A subtype is a datatype that is related to another datatype (the supertype) by some notion of substitutability, meaning that program elements (typically subroutines or functions), written to operate on elements of the supertype, can also operate on elements of the subtype. 

If S is a subtype of T, the subtyping relation (written as ,  , or   ) means that any term of type S can &quot;safely be used&quot; in &quot;any context&quot; where a term of type T is expected. The precise semantics of subtyping here crucially depends on the particulars of how &quot;safely be used&quot; and &quot;any context&quot; are defined by a given type formalism or programming language. The type system of a programming language essentially defines its own subtyping relation, which may well be trivial, should the language support no (or very little) conversion mechanisms.

Due to the subtyping relation, a term may belong to more than one type. Subtyping is therefore a form of type polymorphism. In object-oriented programming the term &#x27;polymorphism&#x27; is commonly used to refer solely to this &quot;subtype polymorphism&quot;, while the techniques of parametric polymorphism would be considered &quot;generic programming&quot;.

Functional programming languages often allow the subtyping of records. Consequently, simply typed lambda calculus extended with record types is perhaps the simplest theoretical setting in which a useful notion of subtyping may be defined and studied. Because the resulting calculus allows terms to have more than one type, it is no longer a &quot;simple&quot; type theory. Since functional programming languages, by definition, support function literals, which can also be stored in records, records types with subtyping provide some of the features of object-oriented programming. Typically, functional programming languages also provide some, usually restricted, form of parametric polymorphism. In a theoretical setting, it is desirable to study the interaction of the two features; a common theoretical setting is system F&lt;:. Various calculi that attempt to capture the theoretical properties of object-oriented programming may be derived from system F&lt;:.

The concept of subtyping is related to the linguistic notions of hyponymy and holonymy. It is also related to the concept of bounded quantification in mathematical logic (see Order-sorted logic). Subtyping should not be confused with the notion of (class or object) inheritance from object-oriented languages; subtyping is a relation between types (interfaces in object-oriented parlance) whereas inheritance is a relation between implementations stemming from a language feature that allows new objects to be created from existing ones. In a number of object-oriented languages, subtyping is called interface inheritance, with inheritance referred to as &quot;implementation inheritance&quot;.

== Origins ==
The notion of subtyping in programming languages dates back to the 1960s; it was introduced in Simula derivatives. The first formal treatments of subtyping were given by John C. Reynolds in 1980 who used category theory to formalize implicit conversions, and Luca Cardelli (1985).

The concept of subtyping has gained visibility (and synonymy with polymorphism in some circles) with the mainstream adoption of object-oriented programming. In this context, the principle of safe substitution is often called the Liskov substitution principle, after Barbara Liskov who popularized it in a keynote address at a conference on object-oriented programming in 1987. Because it must consider mutable objects, the ideal notion of subtyping defined by Liskov and Jeannette Wing, called behavioral subtyping is considerably stronger than what can be implemented in a type checker. (See below for details.)

== Examples ==

A simple practical example of subtypes is shown in the diagram. The type &quot;bird&quot; has three subtypes &quot;duck&quot;, &quot;cuckoo&quot; and &quot;ostrich&quot;. Conceptually, each of these is a variety of the basic type &quot;bird&quot; that inherits many &quot;bird&quot; characteristics but has some specific differences. The UML notation is used in this diagram, with open-headed arrows showing the direction and type of the relationship between the supertype and its subtypes.

As a more practical example, a language might allow integer values to be used wherever floating point values are expected (codice_1 &lt;: codice_2), or it might define a generic type &lt;samp&gt;Number&lt;/samp&gt; as a common supertype of integers and the reals. In this second case, we only have codice_1 &lt;: codice_4 and codice_2 &lt;: codice_4, but codice_1 and codice_2 are not subtypes of each other.

Programmers may take advantage of subtyping to write code in a more abstract manner than would be possible without it. Consider the following example:
function max (x as Number, y as Number) is
 if x &lt; y then
 return y
 else
 return x
end
If integer and real are both subtypes of codice_4, and an operator of comparison with an arbitrary Number is defined for both types, then values of either type can be passed to this function. However, the very possibility of implementing such an operator highly constrains the Number type (for example, one can&#x27;t compare an integer with a complex number), and actually only comparing integers with integers, and reals with reals, makes sense. Rewriting this function so that it would only accept &#x27;x&#x27; and &#x27;y&#x27; of the same type requires bounded polymorphism.

== Subsumption ==

In type theory the concept of &quot;subsumption&quot; is used to define or evaluate whether a type S is a subtype of type T.

A type is a set of values. The set can be described &quot;extensionally&quot; by listing all the values, or it can be described &quot;intensionally&quot; by stating the membership of the set by a predicate over a domain of possible values. In common programming languages enumeration types are defined extensionally by listing values. User-defined types like records (structs, interfaces) or classes are defined intensionally by an explicit type declaration or by using an existing value, which encodes type information, as a prototype to be copied or extended.

In discussing the concept of subsumption, the set of values of a type is indicated by writing its name in mathematical italics: . The type, viewed as a predicate over a domain, is indicated by writing its name in bold: T. The conventional symbol &lt;: means &quot;is a subtype of&quot;, and :&gt; means &quot;is a supertype of&quot;.

* A type T &quot;subsumes&quot; S if the set of values which it defines, is a superset of the set , so that every member of is also a member of . 
* A type may be subsumed by more than one type: the supertypes of S intersect at .
* If S &lt;: T (and therefore ), then T, the predicate which circumscribes the set , must be part of the predicate S (over the same domain) which defines . 
* If S subsumes T, and T subsumes S, then the two types are equal (although they may not be the same type if the type system distinguishes types by name).

In terms of information specificity, a subtype is considered more specific than any one of its supertypes, because it holds at least as much information as each of them. This may increase the applicability, or &quot;relevance&quot; of the subtype (the number of situations where it can be accepted or introduced), as compared to its &quot;more general&quot; supertypes. The disadvantage of having this more detailed information is that it represents incorporated choices which reduce the &quot;prevalence&quot; of the subtype (the number of situations which are able to generate or produce it).

In the context of subsumption, the type definitions can be expressed using Set-builder notation, which uses a predicate to define a set. Predicates can be defined over a domain (set of possible values) . Predicates are partial functions that compare values to selection criteria. For example: &quot;is an integer value greater than or equal to 100 and less than 200?&quot;. If a value matches the criteria then the function returns the value. If not, the value is not selected, and nothing is returned. (List comprehensions are a form of this pattern used in many programming languages.)

If there are two predicates, formula_1 which applies selection criteria for the type T, and formula_2 which applies additional criteria for the type S, then sets for the two types can be defined:

:formula_3

:formula_4
The predicate formula_5 is applied alongside formula_2 as part of the compound predicate S defining . The two predicates are &quot;conjoined&quot;, so both must be true for a value to be selected. The predicate formula_7 subsumes the predicate T, so 

For example: there is a subfamily of cat species called &quot;Felinae&quot;, which is part of the family &quot;Felidae&quot;. The genus &quot;Felis&quot;, to which the domestic cat species &quot;Felis catus&quot; belongs, is part of that subfamily.

:formula_8

:formula_9

The conjunction of predicates has been expressed here through application of the second predicate over the domain of values conforming to the first predicate. Viewed as types, .

If T subsumes S (T :&gt; S) then a procedure, function or expression given a value formula_10 as an operand (parameter value or term) will therefore be able to operate over that value as one of type T, because formula_11. In the example above, we could expect the function &quot;ofSubfamily&quot; to be applicable to values of all three types Felidae, Felinae and Felis.

== Subtyping schemes ==

Type theorists make a distinction between nominal subtyping, in which only types declared in a certain way may be subtypes of each other, and structural subtyping, in which the structure of two types determines whether or not one is a subtype of the other. The class-based object-oriented subtyping described above is nominal; a structural subtyping rule for an object-oriented language might say that if objects of type &quot;A&quot; can handle all of the messages that objects of type &quot;B&quot; can handle (that is, if they define all the same methods), then &quot;A&quot; is a subtype of &quot;B&quot; regardless of whether either inherits from the other. This so-called &quot;duck typing&quot; is common in dynamically typed object-oriented languages. Sound structural subtyping rules for types other than object types are also well known.

Implementations of programming languages with subtyping fall into two general classes: &quot;inclusive&quot; implementations, in which the representation of any value of type &quot;A&quot; also represents the same value at type &quot;B&quot; if &quot;A&quot; &lt;: &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;coercive&quot; implementations, in which a value of type &quot;A&quot; can be &quot;automatically converted&quot; into one of type &quot;B&quot;. The subtyping induced by subclassing in an object-oriented language is usually inclusive; subtyping relations that relate integers and floating-point numbers, which are represented differently, are usually coercive.

In almost all type systems that define a subtyping relation, it is reflexive (meaning &quot;A&quot; &lt;: &quot;A&quot; for any type &quot;A&quot;) and transitive (meaning that if &quot;A&quot; &lt;: &quot;B&quot; and &quot;B&quot; &lt;: &quot;C&quot; then &quot;A&quot; &lt;: &quot;C&quot;). This makes it a preorder on types.

== Record types ==

=== Width and depth subtyping ===

Types of records give rise to the concepts of &quot;width&quot; and &quot;depth&quot; subtyping. These express two different ways of obtaining a new type of record that allows the same operations as the original record type.

Recall that a record is a collection of (named) fields. Since a subtype is a type which allows all operations allowed on the original type, a record subtype should support the same operations on the fields as the original type supported.

One kind of way to achieve such support, called &quot;width subtyping&quot;, adds more fields to the record. More formally, every (named) field appearing in the width supertype will appear in the width subtype. Thus, any operation feasible on the supertype will be supported by the subtype.

The second method, called &quot;depth subtyping&quot;, replaces the various fields with their subtypes. That is, the fields of the subtype are subtypes of the fields of the supertype. Since any operation supported for a field in the supertype is supported for its subtype, any operation feasible on the record supertype is supported by the record subtype. Depth subtyping only makes sense for immutable records: for example, you can assign 1.5 to the &#x27;x&#x27; field of a real point (a record with two real fields), but you can&#x27;t do the same to the &#x27;x&#x27; field of an integer point (which, however, is a deep subtype of the real point type) because 1.5 is not an integer (see Variance).

Subtyping of records can be defined in System F&lt;:, which combines parametric polymorphism with subtyping of record types and is a theoretical basis for many functional programming languages that support both features.

Some systems also support subtyping of labeled disjoint union types (such as algebraic data types). The rule for width subtyping is reversed: every tag appearing in the width subtype must appear in the width supertype.

==Function types==

If is a function type, then a subtype of it is any function type with the property that and This can be summarised using the following typing rule:

formula_12

The parameter type of is said to be contravariant because the subtyping relation is reversed for it, whereas the return type is covariant. Informally, this reversal occurs because the refined type is &quot;more liberal&quot; in the types it accepts and &quot;more conservative&quot; in the type it returns. This is what exactly works in Scala: a &quot;n&quot;-ary function is internally a class that inherits the formula_13 trait (which can be seen as a general interface in Java-like languages), where formula_14 are the parameter types, and formula_15 is its return type; &quot;−&quot; before the type means the type is contravariant while &quot;+&quot; means covariant.

In languages that allow side effects, like most object-oriented languages, subtyping is generally not sufficient to guarantee that a function can be safely used in the context of another. Liskov&#x27;s work in this area focused on behavioral subtyping, which besides the type system safety discussed in this article also requires that subtypes preserve all invariants guaranteed by the supertypes in some contract. This definition of subtyping is generally undecidable, so it cannot be verified by a type checker.

The subtyping of mutable references is similar to the treatment of parameter values and return values. Write-only references (or &quot;sinks&quot;) are contravariant, like parameter values; read-only references (or &quot;sources&quot;) are covariant, like return values. Mutable references which act as both sources and sinks are invariant.

==Relationship with inheritance==

Subtyping and inheritance are independent (orthogonal) relationships. They may coincide, but none is a special case of the other. In other words, between two types &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot;, all combinations of subtyping and inheritance are possible:
# &quot;S&quot; is neither a subtype nor a derived type of &quot;T&quot;
# &quot;S&quot; is a subtype but is not a derived type of &quot;T&quot;
# &quot;S&quot; is not a subtype but is a derived type of &quot;T&quot;
# &quot;S&quot; is both a subtype and a derived type of &quot;T&quot;
The first case is illustrated by independent types, such as codice_10 and codice_2.

The second case can be illustrated by the relationship between codice_12 and codice_13. In most object oriented programming languages, codice_13 are unrelated by inheritance to codice_12. However codice_12 can be considered a subtype of codice_13 since any 32 bit integer value can be promoted into a 64 bit integer value.
The third case is a consequence of function subtyping input contravariance. Assume a super class of type &quot;T&quot; having a method &quot;m&quot; returning an object of the same type (&quot;i.e.&quot; the type of &quot;m&quot; is &quot;T&quot; → &quot;T&quot;, also note that the first parameter of &quot;m&quot; is this/self) and a derived class type &quot;S&quot; from &quot;T&quot;. By inheritance, the type of &quot;m&quot; in &quot;S&quot; is &quot;S&quot; → &quot;S&quot;. In order for &quot;S&quot; to be a subtype of &quot;T&quot; the type of &quot;m&quot; in &quot;S&quot; must be a subtype of the type of &quot;m&quot; in &quot;T&quot; , in other words: &quot;S&quot; → &quot;S&quot; ≤: &quot;T&quot; → &quot;T&quot;. By bottom-up application of the function subtyping rule, this means: &quot;S&quot; ≤: &quot;T&quot; and &quot;T&quot; ≤: &quot;S&quot;, which is only possible if &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are the same. Since inheritance is an irreflexive relation, &quot;S&quot; can&#x27;t be a subtype of &quot;T&quot;. 

Subtyping and inheritance are compatible when all inherited fields and methods of the derived type have types which are subtypes of the corresponding fields and methods from the inherited type .

==Coercions==
In coercive subtyping systems, subtypes are defined by implicit type conversion functions from subtype to supertype. For each subtyping relationship (&quot;S&quot; &lt;: &quot;T&quot;), a coercion function &quot;coerce&quot;: &quot;S&quot; → &quot;T&quot; is provided, and any object &quot;s&quot; of type &quot;S&quot; is regarded as the object &quot;coerce&quot;&quot;S&quot; → &quot;T&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) of type &quot;T&quot;. A coercion function may be defined by composition: if &quot;S&quot; &lt;: &quot;T&quot; and &quot;T&quot; &lt;: &quot;U&quot; then &quot;s&quot; may be regarded as an object of type &quot;u&quot; under the compound coercion (&quot;coerce&quot;&quot;T&quot; → &quot;U&quot; ∘ &quot;coerce&quot;&quot;S&quot; → &quot;T&quot;). The type coercion from a type to itself &quot;coerce&quot;&quot;T&quot; → &quot;T&quot; is the identity function &quot;id&quot;T.

Coercion functions for records and disjoint union subtypes may be defined componentwise; in the case of width-extended records, type coercion simply discards any components which are not defined in the supertype. The type coercion for function types may be given by &quot;f&quot;&#x27;(&quot;t&quot;) = &quot;coerce&quot;&quot;S&quot;2 → &quot;T&quot;2(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;coerce&quot;&quot;T&quot;1 → &quot;S&quot;1(&quot;t&quot;))), reflecting the contravariance of parameter values and covariance of return values.

The coercion function is uniquely determined given the subtype and supertype. Thus, when multiple subtyping relationships are defined, one must be careful to guarantee that all type coercions are coherent. For instance, if an integer such as 2 : &quot;int&quot; can be coerced to a floating point number (say, 2.0 : &quot;float&quot;), then it is not admissible to coerce 2.1 : &quot;float&quot; to 2 : &quot;int&quot;, because the compound coercion &quot;coerce&quot;&quot;float&quot; → &quot;float&quot; given by &quot;coerce&quot;&quot;int&quot; → &quot;float&quot; ∘ &quot;coerce&quot;&quot;float&quot; → &quot;int&quot; would then be distinct from the identity coercion &quot;id&quot;&quot;float&quot;.

<text>The Mountain Bike Hall of Fame (MBHOF) was founded in 1988 to chronicle the history of mountain biking. Formerly located in Crested Butte, Colorado, it relocated to Fairfax, California in 2014 and became part of the Marin Museum of Bicycling.&lt;ref name=&quot;marinij/biking-birth&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the creation of this sport in the 1970s, mountain biking has grown to be immensely popular worldwide and the MBHOF works to document individuals and events which have significantly contributed to mountain biking history. The museum houses items of memorabilia, vintage bikes and components, classic photos, press clippings, and highlights from historic races and events. As of 2016, the MBHOF has inducted more than 140 individuals and groups who have made major contributions to mountain biking.

<text>An inquisitor was an official (usually with judicial or investigative functions) in an inquisition – an organization or program intended to eliminate heresy and other things contrary to the doctrine or teachings of the Catholic faith. Literally, an inquisitor is one who &quot;searches out&quot; or &quot;inquires&quot; (Latin &quot;inquirere&quot; &lt; &quot;quaerere&quot;, &#x27;to seek&#x27;). 

In some cases, inquisitors sought out the social networks that people used to spread heresy. 

There were multiple national inquisitions with different approaches and targets. 

==Controversies==
In the Albigensian Crusade a second-hand story arose that inquisitor and general Arnaud Amalric at the storming of Béziers advocated general slaughter, saying “Kill them. For God knows who are his.” Amalric&#x27;s own report to the Pope was that his troops jumped the gun and took over the town violently before he was aware. 


==Prominent inquisitors==
Some of the better-known and notable inquisitors throughout history include:

*Peter of Verona (also known as Saint Peter Martyr), whose canonization was the fastest in history
* Pedro de Arbués
* Nicolau Aymerich author of &quot;Directorium Inquisitorum&quot;
* Stephen of Bourbon
* Arnaut Catalan
* Fabio Chigi (later Pope Alexander VII)
* Diego Deza
* Bernard Gui
* Heinrich Institoris, author of &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;
* Francisco Jimenez de Cisneros
* Konrad von Marburg
* Sebastien Michaelis
* Giovanni Pietro Carafa (later Pope Paul IV)
* Jacob Sprenger, purported co-author of &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;
* Tomás de Torquemada
* Martín García Ceniceros
* Hentenius (1540s-1566)
* Vincenza Matilde Testaferrata, female inquisitor

<text>Grand Inquisitor (, literally &quot;Inquisitor General&quot; or &quot;General Inquisitor&quot;) was the highest-ranked official of the Inquisition. The title usually refers to the inquisitor of the Spanish Inquisition, in charge of appeals and cases of aristocratic importance, even after the reunification of the inquisitions. Secretaries-general of the Roman Inquisition were often styled as &quot;Grand Inquisitor&quot; but the role and functions were different.

The Portuguese Inquisition was headed by a Grand Inquisitor, or General Inquisitor, named by the Pope but selected by the king, always from within the royal family.

The most famous Inquisitor General was the Spanish Dominican Tomás de Torquemada, who spearheaded the Spanish Inquisition.

<doc id="213516" wikidata="Q14310" url="?curid=213516" title="Yerkes Observatory">
<text>Yerkes Observatory ( ) is an astronomical observatory located in Williams Bay, Wisconsin, United States. The observatory was operated by the University of Chicago Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics from its founding in 1897 until 2018. Ownership was transferred to the non-profit Yerkes Future Foundation (YFF) in May 2020, which began millions of dollars of restoration and renovation of the historic building and grounds. Yerkes re-opened for public tours and programming in May 2022.

The observatory, often called &quot;the birthplace of modern astrophysics&quot;, was founded in 1892 by astronomer George Ellery Hale and financed by businessman Charles T. Yerkes. It represented a shift in the thinking about observatories, from their being mere housing for telescopes and observers, to the early-20th-century concept of observation equipment integrated with laboratory space for physics and chemistry analysis. 

The observatory&#x27;s main dome houses a 40-in aperture (102 cm) doublet lens refracting telescope, the largest refractor ever successfully used for astronomical observation. The Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope in the Canary Islands has a slightly larger 43-in diameter (109 cm) lens but only 39-in (99 cm) clear aperture and is primarily dedicated to solar observations. There are two smaller domes at Yerkes in which are currently mounted 41-inch (104 cm) and 24-inch (60 cm) reflecting telescopes. The observatory also holds a collection of over 170,000 photographic plates.

The Yerkes 40-inch was the largest refracting-type telescope in the world when it was dedicated in 1897. Another large telescope of this period was the Great Melbourne Telescope, which was a reflector. In the United States, the Lick refractor had just a few years earlier come online in 1888 in California with a 36-inch (91 cm)lens. 

Prior to its installation, the telescope on its enormous German equatorial mount was shown at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exhibition in Chicago, Illinois during the time the observatory was under construction.

The observatory was a center for serious astronomical research for more than 100 years. By the 21st century, however, the historic telescope had reached the end of its research life. The University of Chicago closed the observatory in October 2018. In November 2019, it was announced that the university would transfer Yerkes Observatory to the non-profit Yerkes Future Foundation (YFF). The transfer of ownership took place on May 1, 2020. 

==Telescopes==
In the 1860s Chicago became home of the largest telescope in America, the Dearborn refractor. It was later surpassed by the U.S. Naval Observatory&#x27;s 26 inch, which would go on to discover the moons of Mars in 1877. There was an extraordinary increase of larger telescopes in finely furnished observatories in the late 1800s. In the 1890s various forces came together to establish an observatory of art, science, and superlative instruments in Williams Bay, Wisconsin.

The telescope was surpassed by the Harvard College Observatory, reflector less than ten years later, although it remained a center for research for decades afterwards. In addition to the large refractor, Yerkes also conducted a great amount of Solar observations.

===Background===
Yerkes Observatory&#x27;s 40-inch (102 cm) refracting telescope has a doublet lens produced by the optical firm Alvan Clark &amp; Sons and a mounting by the Warner &amp; Swasey Company. It was the largest refracting telescope used for astronomical research. In the years following its establishment, the bar was set and tried to be exceeded; an even larger demonstration refractor, the Great Paris Exhibition Telescope of 1900, was exhibited at the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1900. 

However, this was not much of a success, was dismantled, and did not become part of an active University observatory. The mounting and tube for the 40-inch telescope was exhibited at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago before being installed in the observatory. The grinding of the lens was completed later.

===40-inch aperture refractor===
The glass blanks for what would become Yerkes Great Refractor were made in Paris, France by Mantois and delivered to Alvan Clark &amp; Sons in Massachusetts where they were completed. Clark then made what would be the largest telescope lens ever crafted and this was mounted to an Equatorial mount made by Warner &amp; Swasey for the observatory. The telescope has an aperture of 40 inches (~102 cm) and focal length of 19.3 meters, giving it a focal ratio of f/19. 

The lens, an achromatic doublet which has two sections to reduce chromatic aberration, weighed 225 kilograms, and was the last big lens made by Clark before he died in 1897. Glass lens telescopes had a good reputation compared to speculum metal and silver on glass mirror telescopes, which had not quite proven themselves in the 1890s. For example, the Leviathan of Parsonstown was a 1.8 meter telescope with a speculum metal mirror, but getting good astronomical results from this technology could be difficult. Another large telescope of this period was the Great Melbourne Telescope in Australia, also a metal mirror telescope.
Some of the instruments for the 40-inch refractor (circa 1890s) were:
*Filar Micrometer
*Solar spectrograph
*Spectroheliograph
*Stellar spectrograph
*Photoheliograph
*Photographic plate camera

The 40-inch refractor was modernized in the late 1960s with electronics of the period. The telescope was painted, the manual controls were removed, and electric operations were added at that time. This included nixie tube displays for its operation.

===41-inch reflector===

In the late 1960s a 40-inch reflecting telescope was added to the observatory complex. The 41 inch was finished by 1968, with overall installation completed by December 1967 and the optics in 1968. While the telescope has a clear aperture of 40-inches, the mirror&#x27;s physical diameter measures 41-inches leading to the telescope usually being called the &quot;41 inch&quot; to avoid confusion with the 40 inch refractor. The mirror is made from low-expansion glass. The glass used was CER-VII−R.

The launch instruments for the 41 inch reflector included:

* Image tube spectrograph
* Photoelectric photometer
* Photoelectric spectrophotometer
* Photographic plate camera

The reflector is of the &quot;Ritchey&quot;-&quot;Chretien&quot; optical design. The 41-inch helped pioneer the field of adaptive optics.

===Additional instruments and equipment===
A 12-inch refractor was moved to Yerkes from Kenwood Observatory in the 1890s. Two other telescopes planned for the observatory in the 1890s were a 12-inch aperture refractor and a 24-inch reflecting telescope. There was a heliostat mirror and a meridian room for a transit instrument.

A two-foot aperture reflecting telescope was manufactured at the observatory itself. The clear aperture of the telescope was actually 23.5 inches. The glass blanks were cast in France by Saint Gobain Glass Works, and then were figured (polished into telescopic shape) at Yerkes Observatory. The &#x27;Two foot telescope&#x27; used a roughly seven foot long skeleton truss made of aluminum.

The Observatory had an IBM 1620 computer, which it used for three years. This was replaced with an IBM 1130 computer in the 1960s.

A microphotometer built by Gaertner Scientific Corporation was delivered to the observatory in February 1968.

A 24-inch reflecting telescope with Cassegrain optical setup, 24-inch (61 cm) clear aperture, and an off-axis equatorial mount by Boller &amp; Chivens was contracted in the early 1960s under direction of observatory director W. Albert Hiltner This telescope was installed in one of the smaller Yerkes domes and was used for visitor programs.

A 7-inch (18 cm) diameter aperture Schmidt camera was also at Yerkes Observatory. 

The Snow Solar Telescope was first established at Yerkes Observatory and moved to California in 1904. A major difficulty of these telescopes was dealing with heat from the Sun. It was built horizontally but led to a vertical solar tower design afterwards. 

Another instrument located at the observatory was the Bruce photographic telescope. The telescope had two objective lenses for photography, one doublet of 10-inches aperture and another of 6.5-inches; in addition there is a 5-inch guide scope for visual viewing. The telescope was constructed from funds donated in 1897. The telescope was mounted on a custom designed equatorial, the result of collaboration between Yerkes and Warner &amp; Swasey, especially designed to offer an uninterrupted tracking for long image exposures. The images were taken on glass plates about a foot on each side.

The Bruce astrograph lenses were made by Brashear with Mantois of Paris glass blanks, and the lenses were completed by the year 1900. The overall telescope was not completed until 1904, where it was installed in its own dome at Yerkes. 

The astronomer Edward Emerson Barnard&#x27;s work with the Bruce telescope, with his niece Mary R. Calvert who worked as his assistant and computer, lead to the publication of a sky atlas using images taken with the instrument, and also a catalog of dark nebulae known as the Barnard catalog.

== Dedication ==

The Observatory was dedicated on October 21, 1897, and there was a large party with university, astronomers, and scientists.

Before the dedication, a conference of astronomers and astrophysicists was hosted at Yerkes Observatory, taking place on October 18–20, 1897. This is noted as a precursor to the founding of the American Astronomical Society.

Although dedicated in 1897, it was founded in 1892. Also, astronomical observations had started in the summer of 1897 before the dedication.

==Research and observations==
Research conducted at Yerkes includes work on the interstellar medium, globular cluster formation, infrared astronomy, and near-Earth objects. The University of Chicago also maintained an engineering center in the observatory, dedicated to building and maintaining scientific instruments. In 2012, the engineers completed work on the High-resolution Airborne Wideband Camera (HAWC), part of the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). Researchers also use the Yerkes collection of over 170,000 archival photographic plates that date to the 1890s.

The editorial offices for The Astrophysical Journal were located at Yerkes Observatory until the 1960s. In June 1967, Yerkes Observatory hosted the to-date largest meeting of the American Astronomical Society, with talks on over 200 papers. 

The &quot;Yerkes spectral classification&quot; (aka &quot;MKK&quot; system) was a system of stellar spectral classification introduced in 1943 by William Wilson Morgan, Philip C. Keenan, and Edith Kellman from Yerkes Observatory. This two-dimensional (temperature and luminosity) classification scheme is based on spectral lines sensitive to stellar temperature and surface gravity, which are related to luminosity (the &quot;Harvard classification&quot; is based on surface temperature). Later, in 1953, after some revisions of lists of standard stars and classification criteria, the scheme was named the &quot;Morgan–Keenan classification&quot;, or &quot;MK.&quot;

Research work of the Yerkes Observatory has been cited over 10,000 times.

In 1899, observations of Neptune&#x27;s moon Triton were published, with data recorded using the Warner &amp; Swasey micrometer. In 1898 and 1899, Neptune was at opposition.

In 1906, a star catalog of over 13,600 stars was published. Also, there was important work on Solar research in the early years, which was of interest to Hale. He went on to the Snow Solar Telescope at Mount Wilson in California. This was first operated at Yerkes and then moved to California.

An example of an asteroid discovered at Yerkes is 1024 Hale, provisional designation , a carbonaceous background asteroid from the outer regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. The asteroid was discovered on 2 December 1923 by Belgian–American astronomer George Van Biesbroeck at Yerkes Observatory, and it was named for astronomer George Ellery Hale of Yerkes Observatory fame. Some additional examples include 990 Yerkes, 991 McDonalda, and 992 Swasey around this time; many more minor planets would be discovered at the observatory in the following decades.

==Notable staff and visitors==
Notable astronomers who conducted research at Yerkes include Albert Michelson, Edwin Hubble (who did his graduate work at Yerkes and for whom the Hubble Space Telescope was named), Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar (for whom the Chandra Space Telescope was named), Ukrainian-American astronomer Otto Struve, Dutch-American astronomer Gerard Kuiper (noted for theorizing the Kuiper belt, home to dwarf planet Pluto), Nancy Grace Roman, NASA&#x27;s first Chief of Astronomy (who did her graduate work at Yerkes), and the twentieth-century popularizer of astronomy Carl Sagan. In 2022, astronomer Dr. Amanda Bauer was the first astronomer hired by the Yerkes Future Foundation, which took over the observatory, its restoration and operation from the University of Chicago in 2020. She came to Yerkes from the Vera Rubin Telescope, then under construction in Chile, and was appointed the first-ever Montgomery Foundation Deputy Director and Head of Science and Education.

In 2006, the University of Chicago announced plans to sell the observatory and its land to a developer. Under the plan, a 100-room resort with a large spa operation and attendant parking and support facilities was to be located on the virgin wooded Yerkes land on the lakeshore—the last such undeveloped, natural site on Geneva Lake&#x27;s shoreline. About 70 homes were to be developed on the upper Yerkes property surrounding the historic observatory. These grounds had been designed more than 100 years previously by John Charles Olmsted, the nephew and adopted son of famed landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. Ultimately, Williams Bay&#x27;s refusal to change the zoning from education to residential caused the developer to abandon its development plans. In view of the public controversy surrounding the development proposals, the university suspended these plans in January 2007.

==Closure and Transfer to the Yerkes Future Foundation==

In March 2018, the University of Chicago announced that it would no longer operate the observatory after October 1, 2018, and would be seeking a new owner. In May 2018, the Yerkes Future Foundation, a group of local residents, submitted an expression of interest to the University of Chicago with a proposal that would seek to maintain public access to the site and continuation of the educational programs. Transfer of operation to a successor operator was not arranged by the end of August, and the facility was closed to the general public on October 1. Some research activities continued at the Observatory, including access and use of the extensive historical glass plate archives at the site. Yerkes education and outreach staff formed a nonprofit organization – GLAS – to continue their programs at another site after the closing.

In May 2019, the university continued to negotiate with interested parties on Yerkes&#x27;s future, primarily with the Yerkes Future Foundation. It was announced in November 2018 that a sticking point had been the need to include the Yerkes family in the discussions. Mr. Yerkes&#x27;s agreement in making his donation to the university transfers ownership &quot;To have and to hold unto the said Trustees [of the University of Chicago] and their successors so long as they shall use the same for the purpose of astronomical investigation, but upon their failure to do so, the property hereby conveyed shall revert to the said Charles T. Yerkes or his heirs at law, the same as if this conveyance had never been made.&quot; 

In 2022, the site was re-opened to visitors.

In 2023, Amanda Bauer was interviewed and demonstrated the use of the telescope, partly restored. Full restoration was expected to take 10 more years.

== Gargoyle sculptures, location, and landscaping ==

The Observatory grounds and buildings are renowned for more than the Great Refractor, but also sculptures and architecture. In addition, the landscaping is also famed for its design work by Olmsted. The observatory building was designed by architect Henry Ives Cobb, and has been referred to as being in the Beaux Arts style. The building is noted for its blend of styles and rich ornamentation featuring a variety of animal and mythological designs.

On the building there are various carvings including Lion gargoyle designs. There are also sculptures to represent various people that oversaw or supported construction of the telescope and the facility. The location is noted for a good and pleasant location by Lake Geneva. Although it does not have a high-altitude as preferred by modern observatories, it does have good weather, and is a considerable distance from the light and pollution of Chicago. 

In 1888, Williams Bay had a railway terminal added by Chicago &amp; North Western Railroad; this provided access from Chicago, and is one factor that increased the site&#x27;s development in the following decades.

The landscape was designed by the same firm that designed New York Central park, the firm of Frederick Law Olmsted, and the grounds were noted at one point for having multiple state record trees. The tree plan design was developed in the 1910s under design from the Olmsted firm and with support of the observatory Director; the grounds included the following types of trees at that time: white fir, yellowwood tree, golden rain tree, European beech, fernleaf beech, Japanese pagoda tree, littleleaf linden, Kentucky coffeetree, ginkgo, buckthorn, cut-leaf beeches, and chestnut trees.

The original landscape plan was not completed by the 1897 dedication, and there was grading and construction of gravel roads under direction of the Olmsted design as late as 1908.

==Contemporaries on debut of the Great Yerkes Refractor==
A major contemporary for the Yerkes was the well-regarded 36-inch Lick refractor near San Jose, California. The Yerkes, although just 4 inches in aperture larger, meant an increase of 23% in light-gathering ability. Both telescopes had achromatic doublets by Alvan Clark.

The 19th century saw a transition in large telescope construction from refractor type to reflector type, with metal-film-coated glass mirrors tending to be used instead of difficult, older-style metal mirrors. The Yerkes was perhaps the greatest of the great refractors, the largest astronomical instrument in the traditional style of the 19th century refractor-based observatories. 

The Yerkes was not only the largest refractor, but was tied for being the largest telescope in the world with Paris Observatory reflector (48 inch, 122 cm) when it became operational in 1896.
*Note the Leviathan of Parsonstown was not used after 1890


Understanding atmosphere and trends of telescope building of the late 19th century puts the choice of a large refractor in perspective. Although there were some very large reflectors, the speculum mirrors they relied on reflected about 2/3 of the light and had high upkeep. A major breakthrough came in the middle of the 19th century with a technique for coating glass with a metal film. This process (silver on glass) eventually lead to some bigger glass reflectors. Silvering has its own issues, in that coating must be reapplied usually every 2 years or so depending on conditions, and also it must be done very thinly so as to not affect the optical properties of the mirror.

A large glass reflector (122 cm diameter glass mirror) was established in Paris by 1876, but problems with figuring of that mirror meant that the Paris Observatory&#x27;s 122 cm telescope was not used and did not have a good reputation for viewing. The potential of metal coated glass became more apparent with A. A. Common&#x27;s 36 inch reflecting telescope by 1878 (this won an astrophotography award).

The Warner and Swasey equatorial mount was shown in Chicago at the 1893 Colombia Exhibition, before it was moved to the Observatory.

;Largest telescopes (all types) in 1910
==Legacy==

By 1905, the largest telescope in the World was the Harvard 60-inch Reflector ( 1.524 m 60″) at Harvard College Observatory, USA. Then in 1908, Mount Wilson Observatory matched that size with a 60-inch reflector of their own, and throughout the 20th century, increasingly larger reflectors would be established, aided also by refinements to mirror technologyvapor-deposited aluminum on low-thermal expansion glass, pioneered for the 200 inch (5 meter) Hale telescope of 1948. 

In the latter years of the 20th century, space observatories also marked a major advance, and somewhat less than a century after Yerkes, the Hubble Space Telescope, with a 2.4 meter reflector, was launched. Small refractors remain popular for astronomical photography, although issues with chromatic aberration were never really entirely solved for the lens. (Isaac Newton solved this with the reflecting design, although the refractors are not without their merits.)

Great advancements such as astrophotography and the discovery of nebulas and different types of stars provided a major advance in this period. The importance of finely crafted mounts matched to a large aperture, harnessing the power of the basic equations of the telescopes design to bring the heavens into closer, brighter examination increased humankind&#x27;s understanding of space and Earth&#x27;s place in the Galaxy. Among the accomplishments, Kuiper discovered that Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan has an atmosphere.

<doc id="213517" wikidata="Q1468229" url="?curid=213517" title="Crypto-Judaism">
<text>Crypto-Judaism is the secret adherence to Judaism while publicly professing to be of another faith; practitioners are referred to as &quot;crypto-Jews&quot; (origin from Greek &quot;kryptos&quot; – , &#x27;hidden&#x27;).

The term is especially applied historically to Spanish and Portuguese Jews who outwardly professed Catholicism, also known as &quot;Conversos&quot;, &quot;Marranos&quot;, or the &quot;Anusim&quot;. The phenomenon is especially associated with medieval Spain, following the Massacre of 1391 and the expulsion of the Jews in 1492. After 1492 in Spain and 1497 in Portugal, officially they 
no longer existed. The Spanish Inquisition and the Portuguese Inquisition were established to monitor converted Jews and Muslims and their descendants for their continued adherence to Christian faith and practice, with severe penalties for those convicted of secretly continuing to practice their original beliefs. Information about secretly observant Jews largely survives in Inquisition cases against individuals.

==Europe==

Officially, Jews who converted in Spain during the 14th and 15th centuries were known as &quot;Cristianos Nuevos&quot; (New Christians) but were commonly called &quot;conversos&quot; (converts to Christianity). Spain and Portugal issued edicts restricting their rights in the mother countries of Spain and Portugal and Spanish and Portuguese overseas territories in the Americas.

Although only &quot;Cristianos Viejos&quot; (Old Christians) who could prove &quot;limpieza de sangre&quot; (&quot;cleanliness or purity of blood&quot;) descended from Christian Iberian European ancestry only, without &quot;tainting&quot; of any Jewish ancestry or Muslim Berber/Arab ancestry, were allowed to officially migrate to the New World Spanish possessions, many Christian &quot;conversos&quot; with Jewish antecedents went to the Spanish possessions, using forged &quot;limpieza de sangre&quot; documents, or they entered the Spanish possessions via Portuguese Brazil, particularly 1580–1640 when Spain and Portugal were ruled by the same monarch. The entry requirements to the Portuguese colony of Brazil were more lax and also less rigorously enforced.

Despite the dangers of the Spanish Inquisition in Iberia and the Inquisitions established in Mexico City; Lima, Peru; and Cartagena de Indias in what is now Colombia, many &quot;conversos&quot; continued to secretly and discreetly practice Jewish rituals in the home.

After the Alhambra decree of March 1492, which mandated conversion to Christianity or exile for Jews, numerous &quot;conversos&quot;, also called &quot;Xueta&quot; (or Chueta) in the Balearic Islands ruled by Spain, publicly professed Roman Catholicism but privately adhered to Judaism, even throughout the Spanish Inquisition. 

The &quot;Belmonte Jews&quot; of Portugal, dating from the 12th century, maintained strong secret traditions for centuries. A whole community survived in secrecy by maintaining a tradition of endogamous marriage and hiding all external signs of their faith. They and their practices were discovered only in the 20th century. Their rich Sephardic tradition of crypto-Judaism is unique. Some now profess Orthodox Judaism, although many still retain their centuries-old traditions.

===Role of Maimonides===
As one of the towering figures in Judaism and the author of the Mishneh Torah commentary on the Talmud, Maimonides also issued a landmark doctrinal response to the forced conversions of Jews in the Iberian peninsula by the Almohads:

In his &quot;Epistle on Martyrdom,&quot; however, Maimonides suggested that the persecuted Jew should publicly adopt Islam while maintaining crypto-Judaism and not seek martyrdom unless forced to transgress Jewish commandments in public. He also excoriated one writer, who advocated martyrdom, for &quot;long-winded foolish babbling and nonsense&quot; and for misleading and hurting the Jews. In a sweeping view of the Jewish past, Maimonides marshals examples of heretics and sinners from the Bible to show that even oppressors of Israel were rewarded by God for a single act of piety or respect. How much greater then, he argues, will be the reward of the Jews &quot;who despite the exigencies of forced conversion perform commandments secretly.&quot;

Maimonides championed rationalism over the then-accepted practice of martyrdom when facing religious adversity. This consequently legitimized crypto-Judaism by the religion&#x27;s standards and provided doctrinal backing for Jews during the centuries of the Spanish Inquisition (1478–1834).

===Before the Spanish Inquisition===
According to the Encyclopaedia Judaica, several incidents of forced conversions happened prior to 1492 and outside of Iberia. One of the earliest conversions happened a century after the Fall of Rome and was in Clermont-Ferrand. After a member of the Jewish community in Clermont-Ferrand became a Jewish Christian and was persecuted by other members of the community for doing so, the cavalcade in which he was marching persecuted his persecutors in turn:

The participants in the procession then made an attack &quot;which destroyed [the synagogue] completely, razing it to the grounds.&quot; Subsequently, Bishop *Avitus directed a letter to the Jews in which he disclaimed the use of compulsion to make them adopt Christianity, but announced at the end of the missive: &quot;Therefore if ye be ready to believe as I do, be one flock with us, and I shall be your pastor; but if ye be not ready, depart from this place.&quot; The community hesitated for three days before making a decision. Finally the majority, some 500, accepted Christianity. The Christians in Clermont greeted the event with rejoicing: &quot;Candles were lit, the lamps shone, the whole city radiated with the light of the snow-white flock&quot; (i.e., the forced converts). The Jews who preferred exile left for *Marseilles (Gregory of Tours, Histories, 5:11). The poet Venantius Fortunatus composed a poem to commemorate the occasion. In 582 the Frankish king Chilperic compelled numerous Jews to adopt Christianity. Again the anusim were not wholehearted in their conversion, for &quot;some of them, cleansed in body but not in heart, denied God, and returned to their ancient perfidy, so that they were seen keeping the Sabbath, as well as Sunday&quot; (ibid., 6:17).

The Clermont-Ferrand conversions preceded the first forced conversions in Iberia by 40 years. Forced baptisms of Jews took place in Iberia in 616 at the insistence of Visigoth monarch Sisibut:

Persistent attempts to enforce conversion were made in the seventh century by the Visigoths in Spain after they had adopted the Roman Catholic faith. Comparatively mild legal measures were followed by the harsh edict issued by King Sisibut in 616, ordering the compulsory baptism of all Jews. After conversion, however, the anusim evidently maintained their Jewish cohesion and religious life. It was undoubtedly this problem that continued to occupy Spanish sovereigns at the successive Councils of Toledo representing both the ecclesiastical and secular authorities...Thus, steps were taken to secure that the children of converts had a Christian religious education as well as to prevent the older generation from continuing to observe the Jewish rites or from failing to observe the Catholic ones. A system of strict supervision by the clergy over the way of life and movements of the anusim was imposed...

===Neofiti===
The Neofiti were a group of crypto-Jews living in the Kingdom of Sicily, which included all of Southern Italy from the 13th to the 16th centuries.

===Susiti===
The ancestral line Sus, Süßkind and Lindauer was a crypto-Jewish susitic ancestral line that settled in the Holy Roman Empire and lived as Catholic or Protestant crypto-Jews. Secondary lineages of the Lindauer are: Lindauere, Lindouer, Lindaer, Linduaer, Lindeaur, Lindeauer, Lindhauer, Linndauer, Lindayer as well as Lindaurr. There are some modern Susiti living in the United States, with two verified families: one in Mariah Hill, Indiana and another in Mid-Coast Maine. Susiti rituals from the Protestant tradition, as practiced by the Susiti in Maine, are similar to those of the Karaites and mainly consist of readings from the Psalms and Hebrew Scriptures. The prayers typically involve stepping three steps backward and then forward while reciting Psalm 84:5, followed by Psalm 3 in the morning and Psalm 4 in the evening then the Shema This is then followed by a full repetition of Psalm 145 and the which is called the “Holy Prayer” from Kings 8:22–61 the prayers conclude with a repetition of “Who is like You?”, the Song of Anna, Psalm 60, and Psalm 137, every prayer concludes with &quot;Selah&quot; due to the literal reading of the end of each Psalm and the false pretense that it was an equivalent to Amen. 

==Mediterranean and Asia==
There have been several communities of crypto-Jews in Muslim lands. The ancestors of the Daggatuns in Morocco are thought to have kept up their Jewish practices a long time after their nominal adoption of Islam. In Iran, a large community of crypto-Jews lived in Mashhad, near Khorassan, where they were known as &quot;Jedid al-Islam&quot;; they were mass-converted to Islam around 1839 after the Allahdad events. Most of this community left for Israel in 1946. Some converted to Islam and remained in Iran.

===Portuguese Imperialism in Indian Subcontinent ===

In 1494, after the signing of the Treaty of Tordesillas, authorized by Pope Alexander VI, Portugal was given the right to found colonies in the Eastern Hemisphere. In his lecture at the Library of Congress, Professor Sanjay Subrahmanyam, Chair in Social Sciences at University of California, Los Angeles, explains that crypto-Jews were especially attracted to India because not only was it a center of trade, but India had established ancient Jewish settlements along its Western coast. The presence of these communities meant that crypto-Jews, who had been forced to accept Catholicism but did not want to emigrate to tolerant countries (e.g. Morocco, Poland, Ottoman Empire, etc.), could operate within the Portuguese Empire with the full freedom of Catholic subjects but away from the Inquisition while collaborating with existing Jewish communities to hide their true beliefs.

The presence of crypto-Jews in Goa angered the Archbishop of Goa, Dom Gaspar Jorge de Leão Pereira, and other Europeans like Francis Xavier who wrote polemics and letters to Lisbon urging that the Inquisition be brought to Goa. Crypto-Jews presented a security threat to the Kingdom of Portugal, because Sephardic Jews had an established reputation in Iberia for joining forces with Moors to overthrow Christian rulers. The Goan Inquisition commenced in 1560 and ended in 1812. It targeted crypto-Jews, crypto-Muslims, and crypto-Hindus. Of the 1,582 persons convicted between 1560 and 1623, 45.2% were convicted for offenses related to Judaism and Islam. A compilation of the auto-da-fé statistics of the Goa Inquisition reveal that a total of 57 persons were burnt in the flesh and 64 in effigy (i.e. a statue resembling the person). All the burnt were convicted as relapsed heretics or for sodomy.

== Spanish America ==

Crypto-Judaism was documented chiefly in Spanish-held colonial territories in northern Mexico. Numerous conversos joined Spanish and Portuguese expeditions, believing there was an economic opportunity in the new lands, and that they would have more freedom at a distance far from Iberia. Different situations developed in the early colonial period of Mexico, the frontier province of Nuevo León, the later northern frontier provinces, and the colonial experience of the Mexican Inquisition. The crypto-Jewish traditions have complex histories and are typically embedded in an amalgam of syncretic Roman Catholic and Judaic traditions. In many ways resurgent Judaic practices mirrored indigenous peoples&#x27; maintaining their traditions practiced loosely under a Roman Catholic veil. In addition, Catholicism was syncretic, absorbing other traditions and creating a new creole religion.

The traditional Festival of Santa Esterica was preserved among the Conversos who migrated to the New World and is still practiced today among their descendants.

===Early colonial period – 16th century===
Some of the Sephardic Jews expelled from Spain went to Portugal, but in 1497 that country effectively converted all remaining Jewish children, making them wards of the state unless the parents also converted. Therefore, many of the early crypto-Jewish migrants to Mexico in the early colonial days were technically first to second-generation Portuguese with Spanish roots before that. The number of such Portuguese migrants was significant enough that Spanish colonists began to use &quot;Portuguese&quot; as a synonym for &quot;Jewish&quot; for their settlers. Immigration to Mexico offered lucrative trade possibilities in a well-populated colony with nascent Spanish culture. Some migrants believed that this region would be more tolerant since the lands were overwhelmingly populated by non-Christian indigenous peoples and it was far removed from the metropole.

Colonial officials believed that many crypto-Jews were going to Mexico during the 16th century and complained in written documents to Spain that Spanish society in Mexico would become significantly Jewish. Officials found and condemned clandestine synagogues in Mexico City. At this point, colonial administrators instituted the Law of the Pure Blood, which prohibited migration to Mexico for New Christians (Cristiano Nuevo), i.e. anyone who could not prove to be Old Christians for at least the last three generations. In addition, the administration initiated the Mexican Inquisition to ensure the Catholic orthodoxy of all migrants to Mexico. The Mexican Inquisition was also deployed in the traditional manner to ensure orthodoxy of converted indigenous peoples. The first victims of burnings (or &quot;autos de fé&quot;) of the Mexican Inquisition were indigenous converts convicted of heresy or crypto-Jews convicted of relapsing into their ancestral faith.

Except for those allowed to settle the province of Nuevo Leon under an exemption from the Blood Purity Laws, the number of conversos migrating to the New World was reduced.

===Nuevo León (1590s to early 17th century)===
The colonization of New Spain took place as a northward expansion over increasingly harsh geography, in regions that were occupied by tribes angered at the encroachment; they formed loose confederations of indigenous peoples to resist the settlers. Spain financed the expansion by exploiting mineral wealth, enslaving, or forcing indigenous peoples to labor in mines. It established encomiendas for raising livestock, thereby displacing the local people. The indigenous peoples of the North-Eastern quadrant of New Spain (Nueva España) proved particularly resistant to colonial pressures. The Chichimec, Apache, and other tribes resisted conversion to Christianity and avoided being impressed as laborers or slaves on Spanish ranches and in mines. The Spanish believed such peoples made the frontier (&quot;frontera&quot;) a lawless region.

Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva, a royal accountant, was a Portuguese New Christian. He received a royal charter from the Spanish Crown to settle Nuevo León, a large expanse of land in the hostile frontier. Because of the dangers and difficulties of this region, Carvajal y de la Cueva received an exemption in his charter from the usual requirement that he prove that all new settlers were &quot;Old Christians&quot; (of at least three generations) rather than recently converted Jews or Muslims. This exemption allowed people to go to Nuevo León who were legally barred from entering New Spain elsewhere. Carvajal was authorized to bring 100 soldiers and 60 laborers to New Spain; many have been documented as crypto-Jews.

With Carvajal as governor, Monterrey was established as the center (now in the state of Nuevo León). Within a few years, some people reported to authorities in Mexico City that Jewish rites were being performed in the Northern Province and efforts to convert heathen indigenous peoples were lax. The principal economic activity of Carvajal and his associates seems to have been capturing Indians and selling them into slavery. Carvajal&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor, Gaspar Castaño de Sosa, led a large expedition to New Mexico in 1591 in an effort to establish a colony. Castaño was arrested for this unauthorized expedition and sentenced to exile in the Philippines. The sentence was later reversed, but he had already been killed in the Molucca Islands when the Chinese slaves on his ship mutinied.

Governor Carvajal, his immediate family members, and others of his entourage were called to appear before the Inquisition in Mexico City. They were arrested and jailed. The governor subsequently died in jail, prior to a sentence of exile. His niece Isabel Carvajal had been tortured and implicated all the family in so-called charges. They were all executed by burning at the stake for relapsing into Judaism, except for one nephew who escaped arrest by fleeing to Italy, and one nephew who was a Dominican friar. His nephew, also named Luis, wrote the earliest-known writings by a Jew in the Americas.

When Carvajal was in office, the city of Monterrey became a destination for other crypto-Jews who wanted to escape the Mexican Inquisition in the south of the territory. Thus, Nuevo León and the founding of Monterrey are significant as they attracted crypto-Jewish migrants from all parts of New Spain. They created one of the earliest Jewish-related communities in Mexico. (The Jewish communities in modern Mexico, which practice their Judaism openly, were not established until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, after considerable immigration of Ashkenazi Jews from eastern Europe, and Mizrahi Jews from Turkey and Syria.)

===Former New Spain territories in the United States, 17th–18th centuries===
Due to the Inquisition activities in Nuevo León, many crypto-Jewish descendants migrated to frontier colonies further west, using the trade routes passing through the towns of the Sierra Madre Occidental and Chihuahua, Hermosillo and Cananea, and to the north on the trade route to Paso del Norte and Santa Fe (both cities in the colonial Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico). Some even traveled to Alta California on the Pacific Coast.

In the late 20th century, in modern-day Southwestern United States specifically New Mexico, which was a former territory of New Spain, several Hispanos of New Mexico have stated a belief that they are descended from crypto-Jews of the colonial period. While most maintain their Roman Catholic and Christian faiths, they often cite as evidence memories of older relatives practicing Jewish traditions. Since the 1990s, the crypto-Jews of New Mexico have been extensively studied and documented by several research scholars, including Stanley M. Hordes, Janet Liebman Jacobs, Schulamith Halevy, and Seth D. Kunin, who calls them &quot;Hispanos&quot;. Kunin noted that most of this group in New Mexico has not formally embraced Judaism nor joined the organized Jewish community. Though some have been sceptical, such as Folklorist Judith Neulander arguing that people could be referring to traditions of modern Ashkenazi Jews migrants and Evangelical Protestant Christians who purposely acquired and employed Jewish traditions. More recently, Evangelical Protestant Christians have opened missionary groups aimed at cultivating evangelical doctrine in Southwestern American communities where crypto-Judaism had survived. The highly influential Hordes has been charged with &quot;single-minded speculation based on largely ephemeral or highly ambiguous evidence&quot; for his conclusion that modern-day Hispanos who claim crypto-Jewish roots are heirs to an unbroken chain of transmission. Kunin responded to some of this criticism in his book &quot;Juggling Identities: Identity and Authenticity Among the Crypto-Jews&quot;, in the response Kunin iterated that these scholars were misunderstanding New Mexican identity which, while authentically tied to Christian and Pueblo historicity, is in line with other Spanish converso histories.

===Colombia===
In the department of Antioquia, Colombia, as well as in the greater Paisa region, some families also hold traditions and oral accounts of Jewish descent. In this population, Y-DNA genetic analysis has shown an origin of male founders predominantly from &quot;southern Spain but also suggest that a fraction came from northern Iberia and that some possibly had a Sephardic origin&quot;. Medellín has a tradition of the &quot;marranada&quot;, where a pig is slaughtered, butchered and consumed on the streets of every neighborhood each Christmas. This custom has been interpreted as an annual affirmation of the rejection of Jewish law.

===Bolivia===
A safe haven destination for Sephardic Conversos during the Spanish colonial era was Santa Cruz de la Sierra. In 1557 many crypto-Jews joined Ñuflo de Chávez and were among the pioneers who founded the city. During the 16th century more crypto-Jews that faced persecution from the Inquisition and local authorities in nearby Potosí, La Paz and La Plata moved to Santa Cruz, as it was the most isolated urban settlement and because the Inquisition did not bother the Conversos there; Some settled in the city of Santa Cruz and its adjacent towns, including Vallegrande, Postrervalle, Portachuelo, Terevinto, Pucará, and Cotoca.

Several of the oldest Catholic families in Santa Cruz are of Jewish ancestry; some families still practice certain traditions of Judaism. As recently as the 1920s, several families preserved seven-branched candlesticks and served dishes cooked with kosher practices. It is still customary among certain old families to light candles on Friday at sunset and to mourn the deaths of close relatives by sitting on the floor. After almost five centuries, some of the descendants of these families acknowledge having some Jewish ancestry, but practice Catholicism.

===Elsewhere in Latin America===

In addition to these communities, Roman Catholic-professing communities descended from male and female crypto-Jews are said to exist in the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Jamaica, Puerto Rico and in various other countries of South America, such as Brazil (see Synagogue Kahal Zur Israel in Recife), Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Peru and Ecuador. From these communities comes the proverb, &quot;Catholic by faith, Jewish by blood&quot;.

==Notable crypto-Jews==
*Antonio Fernandez Carvajal was a Portuguese merchant in London; &quot;like other Marranos in London, Carvajal prayed at the Catholic chapel of the Spanish ambassador, while simultaneously playing a leading role in the secret Jewish community, which met at the clandestine synagogue at Creechurch Lane.&quot;
*Isaac Cardoso was a Jewish physician, philosopher, and polemic writer, who was born in Portugal but ultimately settled in Italy. For a time, he went by the name Fernando to evade the Inquisition. After finding safe haven in Verona, he openly embraced Judaism, becoming a leading scholar in Italy.

<doc id="213521" wikidata="Q461613" url="?curid=213521" title="Lick Observatory">
<text>The Lick Observatory is an astronomical observatory owned and operated by the University of California. It is on the summit of Mount Hamilton, in the Diablo Range just east of San Jose, California, United States. The observatory is managed by the University of California Observatories, with headquarters on the University of California, Santa Cruz campus, where its scientific staff moved in the mid-1960s. It is named after James Lick.

The first new moon of Jupiter to be identified since the time of Galileo, Amalthea, the planet&#x27;s fifth moon, was discovered at this observatory in 1892.

== Early history ==
Lick Observatory is the world&#x27;s first permanently occupied mountain-top observatory.
The observatory, in a Classical Revival style structure, was constructed between 1876 and 1887, from a bequest from James Lick of $700,000, .
Lick, originally a carpenter and piano maker, had arrived from Peru in San Francisco, California, in late 1847; after accruing significant wealth he began making various donations in 1873. In his last deed he chose the site atop Mount Hamilton, and was buried there in 1887 under the future site of the telescope, with a brass tablet bearing the inscription, &quot;Here lies the body of James Lick&quot;.


Lick additionally negotiated that Santa Clara County construct a &quot;first-class road&quot; to the summit, completed in 1876. Lick chose John Wright, of San Francisco&#x27;s Wright &amp; Sanders firm of architects, to design both the Observatory and the Astronomer&#x27;s House. All of the construction materials had to be brought to the site by horse and mule-drawn wagons, which could not negotiate a steep grade. To keep the grade below 6.5%, the road had to take a very winding and sinuous path, which the modern-day road (California State Route 130) still follows. The road from Smith Creek to the summit makes 367 complete turns, in a distance of seven miles. The road is closed when there is snow.

The first telescope installed at the observatory was a refractor made by Alvan Clark. Astronomer E. E. Barnard used the telescope to make &quot;exquisite photographs of comets and nebulae&quot;, according to D. J. Warner of Warner &amp; Swasey Company.

In 1880, a lens was commissioned to Alvan Clark &amp; Sons, for $51,000 (). Manufacturing of the lens took until 1885 and it was delivered to the observatory on December 29, 1886. Warner &amp; Swasey designed and built the telescope mounting. The telescope, built with this lens, became the world&#x27;s largest refracting telescope from when it saw first light on January 3, 1888, until the construction of Yerkes Observatory in 1897.

=== Under the University of California ===
In May 1888, the observatory was turned over to the Regents of the University of California,
and it became the first permanently occupied mountain-top observatory in the world. Edward Singleton Holden was the first director. The location provided excellent viewing performance because of lack of ambient light and pollution; additionally, the night air at the top of Mt. Hamilton is extremely calm. Often a layer of low coastal clouds invades the valley below, especially on nights from late-spring to mid-summer, a phenomenon known in California as the June Gloom. On nights when the observatory remains above that layer, light pollution can be greatly reduced.

E. E. Barnard used the telescope in 1892 to discover a fifth moon of Jupiter, Amalthea. This was the first addition to Jupiter&#x27;s known moons since Galileo observed the planet through his parchment tube and spectacle lens. The telescope provided spectra for W. W. Campbell&#x27;s work on the radial velocities of stars.

In 1905 (Jan. 5 and Feb. 27), Charles Dillon Perrine discovered the sixth and seventh moons of Jupiter (Elara and Himalia) on photographs taken with the 36-inch Crossley reflecting telescope which he had recently rebuilt.

On August 7, 1921, an unusually bright mysterious astronomical object was seen from the observatory only about three degrees from the Sun, where recent analysis in 2016 concluded that this is highly likely a comet.

In 1928, Donald C. Shane studied carbon stars, and was able to distinguish them into spectral classes &quot;R&quot;0–&quot;R&quot;9 and &quot;N&quot;0–&quot;N&quot;7 &quot;(&quot;on this scale &quot;N&quot;7 is the reddest and &quot;R&quot;0 the bluest). This was an expansion of Annie Jump Cannon of Harvard&#x27;s work on carbon stars that had divided them into R and N types. The N stars have more cyanogen and the R stars have more carbon.

On May 21, 1939, during a nighttime fog that engulfed the summit, a U.S. Army Air Force Northrop A-17 two-seater attack plane crashed into the main building. Because a scientific meeting was being held elsewhere, the only staff member present was Nicholas Mayall. Nothing caught fire and the two individuals in the building were unharmed. 

The pilot of the plane, Lt. Richard F. Lorenz, and passenger Private W. E. Scott were killed instantly. The telephone line was broken by the crash, so no help could be called for at first. Eventually help arrived together with numerous reporters and photographers, who kept arriving almost all night long. Evidence of their numbers could be seen the next day by the litter of flash bulbs carpeting the parking lot. 

The press widely covered the accident and many reports emphasized the luck in not losing a large cabinet of spectrograms which was knocked over by the crash coming through an astronomer&#x27;s office window. There was no damage to the telescope dome.

In 1950, the California state legislature appropriated funds for a reflector telescope, which was completed in 1959. The observatory additionally has a Cassegrain reflector dedicated to photoelectric measurements of star brightness, and received a pair of astrographs from the Carnegie Corporation.

==Time-signal service==
In 1886, Lick Observatory began supplying Railroad Standard Time to the Southern Pacific Railroad, and to other businesses, over telegraph lines. The signal was generated by a clock manufactured by E. Howard &amp; Co. specifically for the Observatory, and which included an electric apparatus for transmitting the time signal over telegraph lines. While most of the nation&#x27;s railroads received their time signal from the U.S. Naval Observatory time signal via Western Union&#x27;s telegraph lines, the Lick Observatory time signal was used by railroads from the West Coast all the way to Colorado.

==21st century==

With the growth of San Jose, and the rest of Silicon Valley, light pollution became a problem for the observatory. In the 1970s, a site in the Santa Lucia Mountains at Junípero Serra Peak, southeast of Monterey, was evaluated for possible relocation of many of the telescopes. However, funding for the move was not available, and in 1980 San Jose began a program to reduce the effects of lighting, most notably replacing all streetlamps with low pressure sodium lamps. The result is that the Mount Hamilton site remains a viable location for a major working observatory. 

The International Astronomical Union named Asteroid 6216 San Jose to honor the city&#x27;s efforts toward reducing light pollution.

In 2006, there were 23 families in residence, plus typically between two and ten visiting astronomers from the University of California campuses, who stay in dormitories while working at the observatory. The little town of Mount Hamilton atop the mountain has its own police and a post office, and until 2005 had a one-room K-8 school.

In 2008, there were 38 people residing on the mountain; the chef and commons dinner were decommissioned. By 2013, with continuing budget and staff cuts there remain only about nineteen residents and it is common for the observers to work from remote observing stations rather than make the drive, partly as a result of the business office raising the cost to stay in the dorms. The swimming pool has been closed.

In 2013, one of Lick Observatory&#x27;s key funding sources was scheduled for elimination in 2018, which many worried would result in the closing of the entire observatory.

In November 2014, the University of California announced its intention to continue support of Lick Observatory.

Telescopes at Lick Observatory are used by researchers from many campuses of the University of California system. Current topics of research carried out at Lick include exoplanets, supernovae, active galactic nuclei, planetary science, and development of new adaptive optics technologies.

In 2015, Google donated $1 million to the observatory over two years.

In August 2020, the observatory was in danger of being destroyed by the rapidly growing SCU Lightning Complex fires. Firefighters were on standby at Lick Observatory to defend the buildings if necessary. As of the evening of August 19, 2020, the fire was on observatory property and moving quickly. While the residences on Mt. Hamilton sustained some damage during the following night, the telescopes and domes survived.

<doc id="213522" wikidata="Q797773" url="?curid=213522" title="Babson task">
<text>A Babson task (or simply Babson) is a chess problem with the following properties:

#White has only one , or first move, that forces checkmate in the stipulated number of moves.
#Black&#x27;s defences include the promotion of a certain pawn to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. (Black may have other defences as well.)
#If Black promotes, then the only way for White towards a forced checkmate in the stipulated number of moves is to promote a pawn to the same piece to which Black promoted.

 (1852–1929), the task&#x27;s eponym, first conceived of the task in 1884, but never solved it.
To devise a satisfying Babson task is regarded as one of the greatest challenges in chess composing. For almost a century, it was unknown whether such a task could exist.

The Babson task is a special form of Allumwandlung, a chess problem in which the solution contains promotions to each of the four possible pieces. Such problems were already known when Babson formulated his task.
==Forerunners of the Babson task==

This 1912 problem by Wolfgang Pauly is, as it were, a three-quarter Babson task: three of Black&#x27;s promotions are matched by White.

The key is 1.b3, after which there are the following lines:

This is not a full Babson, however, because 1...a1=B 2.f8=B does not work; White must instead play 2.f8=Q, with similar play to above.

==Selfmate Babsons==
The earliest Babson tasks are all in the form of a selfmate, in which White, moving first, must force Black to deliver checkmate against Black&#x27;s will within a specified number of moves. In 1914, Babson himself published such a problem, in which three different white pawns shared the promotions. 

Henry Wald Bettmann composed the first problem in which one black pawn and one white pawn were involved in all promotions, winning 1st prize in the Babson Task Tourney 1925–26.

The key in Bettmann&#x27;s problem is 1.a8=B, after which play is as follows:

Various other composers later composed similar problems.

==Directmate Babsons==

Composing a Babson task in directmate form (where White moves first and must checkmate Black against any defence within a stipulated number of moves) was thought so difficult that very little effort was put into it until the 1960s, when Pierre Drumare began his work on the problem, which occupied him for the next twenty years or so. He managed to compose a Babson task in which the knight is replaced with the nightrider (a fairy chess piece which moves by making any number of knight moves in the same direction on unblocked squares) but found it hard to devise one using normal pieces: because of the knight&#x27;s limited range, it is difficult to justify a knight promotion by White in response to a knight promotion by Black on the other side of the board.

When Drumare eventually succeeded using conventional pieces in 1980, the result was regarded as highly unsatisfactory, even by Drumare himself. It is a mate in five (first published &quot;Memorial Seneca&quot;, 1980). The key is 1.Rf2, after which captures by Black on b1 are answered by captures by White on g8.

Efficiency in chess problems is considered a great boon, but Drumare&#x27;s attempt is very inefficient: no fewer than 30 pieces are on the board. It also has six promoted pieces in the initial position (even a single promoted piece is considered something of a &quot;cheat&quot; in chess problems), which is in any case illegal: one of the white f-pawns must have made a capture, and the white and black b- and c-pawns must have made two captures between them, making three in total, yet only two units are missing from the board. Despite all these flaws, it is the first complete Babson task.

In 1982, two years after composing this problem, Drumare gave up, saying that the Babson task would never be satisfactorily solved.

The following year, Leonid Yarosh, a football coach from Kazan who was virtually unknown as a problem composer until that point, came up with a much better Babson task than Drumare&#x27;s: the position is legal, it is much simpler than Drumare&#x27;s problem, and there are no promoted pieces on board. First published in March 1983 in the famous Russian chess magazine &quot;Shakhmaty v SSSR&quot;, this is generally thought of as the first satisfactory solution of the Babson task. Drumare himself had high praise for the problem.

The key is 1.Rxh4, and the main lines are:
However, Yarosh&#x27;s problem has a small flaw: the key is a capture, something which is generally frowned upon in problems. Also, when first presented, the black piece at h4 was a pawn, but a computer discovered an additional solution by 1.axb8=N hxg3+ 2.Kh3 Bxb8 3.Qxc2 and mate next move. Yarosh then substituted a knight on that square; now 1.axb8=N fails to 1...Nf3+ 2.Bxf3 Bxb8 3.Qxc2 Bxg3+ and White is too late. Nevertheless, when Dutch author Tim Krabbé saw this version in the Soviet publication &quot;64&quot;, he records that the realisation that somebody had at last solved the Babson task had the effect upon him as if he had &quot;... opened a newspaper and seen the headline &#x27;Purpose Of Life Discovered&#x27;.&quot;

Yarosh continued to work on the problem, and in August 1983, he created an improved version with a non-capturing key, which appeared in &quot;Shakhmaty v SSSR&quot;. Many chess problemists, including Tim Krabbé, consider the problem one of the greatest ever composed. Again, it is a mate in four.

The key here is non-capturing and also thematic (that is, it is logically related to the rest of the solution): 1.a7!. The variations are largely the same as in the original:

There is another defence for black that is non-thematic and also leads to mate in four: 1...Qxd8+ 2.Kg7 axb1Q 3.Rxf4+ Qe4 4. Rxd4# However, this is not considered a flaw according to the rules of the Babson task.

Yarosh composed a completely different Babson task later in 1983 and another in 1986. Several other Babsons were later composed by other authors, including one by Drumare in 1985. The solution of this Babson is 1.fxg8Q dxe2 2.Nxe3 e1Q/R/B/N 3.gxf8Q/R/B/N and now mate in two in all variations.

==The cyclic Babson==

In a cyclic Babson, rather than Black’s promotions being matched by White, they are related in cyclic form: for example, Black promoting to a queen means White must promote to a bishop, Black promoting to a bishop means White must promote to a rook, Black promoting to a rook means White must promote to a knight, and Black promoting to a knight means White must promote to a queen.

The August 2003 issue of the German problem magazine &quot;Die Schwalbe&quot; contained the problem to the right, a mate in four by Peter Hoffmann. Hoffmann had previously published a number of conventional directmate Babsons, but this one is significant because it is the first cyclic Babson. However, as with Drumare&#x27;s original Babson task, the problem uses promoted pieces and has a capturing key.

The key is 1.Nxe6, threatening 2.hxg8=Q and 3.Qf7#. The thematic defences are:

*1...d1=Q 2.hxg8=B (2.hxg8=Q? Qd7+ 3.Bxd7 stalemate; 2.hxg8=N+? Kxe6 and no mate), threatening 3.c4+ Q-moves 4.BxQ#
**2...Qd7+ 3.Bxd7 Kxg6 4.Rxh6#
**2...Qxc1 3.Rxg5 (threat: 4.Rf5#) hxg5 4.Qh8#
*1...d1=B 2.hxg8=R (2.hxg8=Q? stalemate; 2.hxg8=N+? Kxe6 and no mate) Kxe6 3.Rd8 3.Kf6 Rd6#
*1...d1=R 2.hxg8=N (2.hxg8=Q? Rd4+ 3.c4 stalemate) Kxe6 3.Qxe2+ K-moves 4.Qe5#
*1...d1=N 2.hxg8=Q (2.hxg8=N+? Kxe6 3.Qxe2+ Ne3! and no mate) Nxb2+ 3.Kb5(Bxb2) and 4.Qf7#

There are also a number of sidelines.
In the September 2005 issue of &quot;&quot;, the first cyclic Babson without promoted pieces in the initial position was published. Again, the composer was Peter Hoffmann.

The key is 1.Nxb6. The thematic defences are:

*1...d1=Q 2.exf8=B (2.exf8=Q? Qd4+ 3.Bxd4 stalemate; 2.exf8=N+? Kd6 3.Be5+ Kc5 and no mate)
**2...Qd4+ 3.exd4 Kxf6 4.d5#
*1...d1=B 2.exf8=R (2.exf8=Q? stalemate; 2.exf8=N+? Kd6 3.Be5+ Kc5 and no mate)
**2...Kd6 3.Qd2+ with mate after any move by black
*1...d1=R 2.exf8=N+ (2.exf8=Q? Rd4+ 3.Bxd4 stalemate; 2.exf8=B? Rd7 3.c8=Q(B) stalemate)
**2...Kd6 3.Be5+ Kc5 4.Qxc2#
*1...d1=N 2.exf8=Q (2.exf8=N+? Kd6 3.Be5+ Kc5 and no mate)
**2...Nxc3+ 3.Kxa5 Ne4 4.c8=Q#

==Babson Task in an endgame study==

Achieving a Babson Task in an endgame study was for long time considered impossible, because of the enormous complexity requested to make every promotion the only winning move, avoiding duals and keeping the position legal. Some partial Babsons have been showed in form of a study, but at maximum 3/4 of the theme was achieved (usually missing the Rook variation).

In October 2024, the Israelian chess composer Gady Costeff published on EG a sound attempt of a complete Babson Task in an endgame study, which was the first in the history of chess composition. Unfortunately, the position was illegal for just one missing White capture (and had three white Knights in the initial position). The composer declared to have worked on that position for more than 13 years, trying to make it legal, but eventually giving up and publishing it anyway, out of competition.

In January 2025, again on EG, the Italian chess composer Daniele Guglielmo Gatti showed a complete Babson Task in an endgame study. The composer declared to have worked for 45 days after having seen the Costeff&#x27;s failed attempt, creating a much different position that keeped some core elements and ideas of Costeff&#x27;s one, but managing to make it legal, sound, with improved economy and without promoted pieces. This made him effectively the first composer in history to correctly achieve the task in an endgame study, 141 years after the theme was proposed by his eponym.

The solution of the study follows:

— 1…f1=Q 2.hxg8=Q! Ne5+ 3.dxe5 Qf4+ 4.Ne4! avoids stalemate and wins, 

— 1…f1=R 2.hxg8=R!/i Rxg1/ii 3.Nd6/iii exd6 4.Ne4+ Kh7 5.Nf6 mate,

— 1…f1=B 2.hxg8=B!/iv Kg7 (Qxe1; Nf3+! wins) 3.c6 Qxe1 4.c7 Qb1 5.Nxe6+ Kxg8 6.c8=Q+ Kh7 7.Ng5+ Kg7 8.Qf5 Qxa2+ 9.Kc5 e1=Q 10.Ne6+ Qxe6 11.Qxe6 wins,

— 1…f1=N 2.hxg8=N+!/v Kg7 3.Nxe6+ Kxg8 4.Rxe2 Nxe3+ 5.Rxe3 Qd2 6.Ree1 Qxa2+ 7.Kb4 Qb3+ 8.Ka5 wins.

i) Thematic try: 2.hxg8=Q? Ne5+! 3.dxe5 Rf4+! 4.Ne4 Qc3+ (or Qxb5+) 5. Kxc3 stalemate.

ii) Rxe1 3.Rxe1 with: Qxe1 4.Nf3+ wins, or g1=Q 4.Nxe6+ (Rxg1? Bd5! mate;) Kh7 5.Rg7+ Kh8 6.Rxg1 wins.

iii) Threatens 4.Nf7 mate. Prematurely 3.Ne4+? Kh7! wins as there is no mate on f6. 

iv) Thematic try: 2.hxg8=N+? Kg7 3.c6 Qxe1 4.c7 Qb1 5.Nxe6+ Kh7 The point: no promotion with check 6.c8=Q Qxa2+ 7.Kb4 Qb3+ 8.Ka5 (Kc5? Qc2+ skewer) e1=Q+ 9.Kb6 Qxe3 another point 10.Nf6+ Kh6 11.g5+ Qxg5 12.Ng8+ Kh5 and draw.

v) Other promotions all fail to Nxe3 mate.

<doc id="213525" wikidata="Q1899749" url="?curid=213525" title="Slow motion">
<text>Slow motion (commonly abbreviated as slow-mo or slo-mo) is an effect in film-making whereby time appears to be slowed down. It was invented by the Austrian priest August Musger in the early 20th century. This can be accomplished through the use of high-speed cameras and then playing the footage produced by such cameras at a normal rate like 30 fps, or in post production through the use of software.

Typically this style is achieved when each film frame is captured at a rate much faster than it will be played back. When replayed at normal speed, time appears to be moving more slowly. A term for creating slow motion film is overcranking which refers to hand cranking an early camera at a faster rate than normal (i.e. faster than 24 frames per second). Slow motion can also be achieved by playing normally recorded footage at a slower speed. This technique is more often applied to video subjected to instant replay than to film. A third technique uses computer software post-processing to fabricate digitally interpolated frames between the frames that were shot. Motion can be slowed further by combining techniques, such as for example by interpolating between overcranked frames. The traditional method for achieving super-slow motion is through high-speed photography, a more sophisticated technique that uses specialized equipment to record fast phenomena, usually for scientific applications.

Slow motion is ubiquitous in modern filmmaking. It is used by a diverse range of directors to achieve diverse effects. Some classic subjects of slow-motion include:

* Athletic activities of all kinds, to demonstrate skill and style.
* To recapture a key moment in an athletic game, typically shown as a replay.
* Natural phenomena, such as a drop of water hitting a glass.

Slow motion can also be used for artistic effect, to create a romantic or suspenseful aura or to stress a moment in time. Vsevolod Pudovkin, for instance, used slow motion in a suicide scene in his 1933 film &quot;The Deserter&quot;, in which a man jumping into a river seems sucked down by the slowly splashing waves. Another example is &quot;Face/Off&quot;, in which John Woo used the same technique in the movements of a flock of flying pigeons. &quot;The Matrix&quot; made a distinct success in applying the effect into action scenes through the use of multiple cameras, as well as mixing slow-motion with live action in other scenes. Japanese director Akira Kurosawa was a pioneer using this technique in his 1954 movie &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;. American director Sam Peckinpah was another classic lover of the use of slow motion. The technique is especially associated with explosion effect shots and underwater footage.

The opposite of slow motion is fast motion. Cinematographers refer to fast motion as undercranking since it was originally achieved by cranking a handcranked camera slower than normal. It is often used for comic, or occasional stylistic effect. Extreme fast motion is known as time lapse photography; a frame of, say, a growing plant is taken every few hours; when the frames are played back at normal speed, the plant is seen to grow before the viewer&#x27;s eyes.

The concept of slow motion may have existed before the invention of the motion picture: the Japanese theatrical form Noh employs very slow movements.

== How slow motion works ==

There are two ways in which slow motion can be achieved in modern cinematography. Both involve a camera and a projector. A projector refers to a classical film projector in a movie theater, but the same basic rules apply to a television screen and any other device that displays consecutive images at a constant frame rate.
=== Overcranking ===
For purposes of making the above illustration readable, a projection speed of 10 frames per second (fps) has been selected (the 24fps film standard makes slow overcranking rare but nevertheless available on professional equipment).


=== Time stretching ===
The second type of slow motion is achieved during post production. This is known as &quot;time-stretching&quot; or &quot;digital slow motion&quot;. This type of slow motion is achieved by inserting new frames in between frames that have actually been photographed. The effect is similar to overcranking as the actual motion occurs over a longer time.
Since the necessary frames were never photographed, new frames must be fabricated. Sometimes the new frames are simply repeats of the preceding frames but more often they are created by interpolating between frames. (Often this motion interpolation is, effectively, a short dissolve between still frames). Many complicated algorithms exist that can track motion between frames and generate intermediate frames within that scene. It is similar to half-speed, and is not true slow-motion but merely a longer display of each frame.

== In action films ==

Slow motion is used widely in action films for dramatic effect, as well as the famous bullet-dodging effect, popularized by &quot;The Matrix&quot;. Formally, this effect is referred to as and is a process whereby the capture frame rate of the camera changes over time. For example, if in the course of 10 seconds of capture, the capture frame rate is adjusted from 60 frames per second to 24 frames per second, when played back at the standard film rate of 24 frames per second, a unique time-manipulation effect is achieved. For example, someone pushing a door open and walking out into the street would appear to start off in slow motion, but in a few seconds later within the same shot the person would appear to walk in &quot;realtime&quot; (everyday speed). The opposite speed-ramping is done in &quot;The Matrix&quot; when Neo re-enters the Matrix for the first time to see the Oracle. As he comes out of the warehouse &quot;load-point&quot;, the camera zooms into Neo at normal speed but as it gets closer to Neo&#x27;s face, time seems to slow down, perhaps visually accentuating Neo pausing and reflecting a moment, and perhaps alluding to future manipulation of time itself within the Matrix later on in the movie.

== In broadcasting ==

Slow-motion is widely used in sport broadcasting and its origins in this domain extend back to the earliest days of television, one example being the European Heavyweight Title in 1939 where Max Schmeling knocked out Adolf Heuser in 71 seconds.
In instant replays, slow motion reviews are now commonly used to show in detail some action (photo finish, goal, ...). Generally, they are made with video servers and special controllers. The first TV slo-mo was the Ampex HS-100 disk record-player. After the HS-100, Type C videotape VTRs with a slow-motion option were used. There were a few special high frame rate TV systems (300 fps) made to give higher quality slow-motion for TV. 300 fps can be converted to both 50 and 60 fps transmission formats without major issues.

==Scientific use==

In scientific and technical applications it is often necessary to slow motion by a very large factor, for example to examine the details of a nuclear explosion. Examples are sometimes published showing, for example, a bullet bursting a balloon.

== Video file recording methods ==
Usually, digital camcorders (including: bridge cameras, DSLM, higher-end compact cameras and mobile phones) historically had two ways of storing slow motion video (or: high framerate video) into the video file: the &quot;real-time method&quot; and the &quot;menial method&quot;.

=== Real-time method ===
The real time method treats the video as a normal video while encoding it. The output video file contains the same framerate as the image sensor output framerate. The duration of the video in the output file also matches the real-life recording duration. And the output video also contains an audio track, like usual videos.

This method is used by all GoPro cameras, Sony RX10/RX100 series cameras (except in the time-limited &quot;super-slow-motion&quot; High Frame Rate (HFR) mode), Apple iPhones with high framerate (slow motion) video recording functionality (starting with the iPhone 5s in late 2013), Sony Xperia flagships since 2014 (Xperia Z2, first Sony flagship with precluded 120fps video recording), LG V series mobile phones and every Samsung Galaxy flagship phone since 2015 (Galaxy S6) for videos with 120 fps or higher.

Every video camera that is able to record at 60 fps (e.g. Asus PadFone 2 (late 2012: 720p@60 fps) and Samsung Mobile starting at the Galaxy Note 3 (late 2013) with 1080p at 60 fps, labelled &quot;smooth motion&quot;), recorded it using the real-time method.

;Advantages:
* Video editing software (e.g. Sony Vegas, Kdenlive and included software in mobile phones) and video playback software (e.g. VLC media player) allow treating such videos as both usual videos and slow-motion videos.
** During video editing and video playback, the indicated playback speed matches real life.
** Metadata viewing software (e.g. MediaInfo) shows a framerate and a time that matches the real-life conditions during the video recording progression.
* Video framerate and duration matches real life.
* Includes audio track, like normal framerate videos.

These advantages make the real-time method the more useful method for power users.

=== Menial method ===
The menial method saves recorded video files in a stretched way, and also without audio track. The framerate in the output file does not match the original sensor output framerate, but the former is lower. The real-life timespan of the recording (while holding the camera) does not match the length of the video in the output file, but the latter is longer. The opposite is the case for time-lapse videos, where the effectively saved framerate is lower than for normal videos

This means that the action visible inside the video runs at slower speeds than in real life, despite the indicated playback speed of ×1.

This encoding method is used by the camera software of the following devices (incomplete list):
* Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ1000 (2014; 1080p@120fps; 1/4×)
* Samsung Omnia 2 &quot;GT-i8000&quot; (2009; QVGA 320×240@120fps; 1/4×) 
* Sony FDR-AX100 (2014; 720p@120fps; 1/4×)
* Sony RX100 IV, V, VI and VII: High Frame Rate (HFR) mode records at 240 fps up to 1,000 fps for 3–7 seconds. This is saved at 24 - 60 fps, i.e. from 1/4x down to 1/40x speed.
* All Samsung Galaxy flagship devices starting from late 2012 to late 2014:
** 2012: Galaxy Note 2: 720×480@120fps
** 2013 H1: Galaxy S4 (800×450@120fps)
** 2013 H1: &quot;S4 Zoom&quot; (720×480@120fps)
** 2013 H2: Galaxy Note 3 (1280×720@120fps)
** 2014 H1: Galaxy S5, Galaxy K Zoom, H2: Note 4 (1280×720@120fps)
* Earlier OnePlus flagship devices (1280×720@120fps).
** OnePlus One

;Advantages:
* The output video file is directly playable as slow motion in video players that do not support adjusting the playback speed (e.g. on a Galaxy S3 Mini).
* The output video file is directly playable in video players and/or on devices that can only handle limited framerates (e.g. on a Galaxy S3 Mini).

=== Comparison ===

;Example:
A 120FPS video whose real-life recording duration is 00h:00m:10s can be encoded in the following methods seen in the table on the Samsung Galaxy Note 2, S4, Note 3, S5 and Note 4 (example devices that use the menial method for 120fps video recording).

In this example, the real-time-method recording device can be an iPhone 5s, a Galaxy S6 (including variants), a Galaxy Note 5, a Sony Xperia Z2, Xperia Z3 or Xperia Z5.

This table also includes references from other video recording types (normal, low-framerate, time-lapse) to facilitate understanding for novice people.

<text>The Côte d&#x27;Azur Observatory (, , OCA) is a network of astronomical observatories throughout southern France. It originated in 1988 with the merger of two observatories:
# Nice Observatory
# Centre de recherches en géodynamique et astrométrie (CERGA)

Cote d&#x27;Azure Observatory tested beam combining technology at CHARA array.

Astronomers developed a theory about M-Type asteroids, that may be tested by the planned spacecraft &quot;Psyche&quot;.

<text>Richmal Crompton Lamburn (15 November 1890 – 11 January 1969) was a popular English writer, best known for her &quot;Just William&quot; series of books, humorous short stories, and to a lesser extent adult fiction books.

==Life==
Richmal Crompton Lamburn was born in Bury, Lancashire, the second child of the Rev. Edward John Sewell Lamburn, a Classics master at Bury Grammar School and his wife Clara (née Crompton). Her brother, John Battersby Crompton Lamburn, also became a writer, remembered under the name John Lambourne for his fantasy novel &quot;The Kingdom That Was&quot; (1931).

Richmal Crompton attended St Elphin&#x27;s Boarding School for the daughters of the clergy, originally based in Warrington, Lancashire. She later moved with the school to a new location in Darley Dale, near Matlock, Derbyshire in 1904. In order to further her chosen career as a schoolteacher, she won a scholarship to Royal Holloway College, part of the University of London in Englefield Green, Surrey. Crompton graduated in 1914 with a BA honours degree in Classics (II class). She took part in the Women&#x27;s Suffrage movement.

In 1914, she returned to St Elphin&#x27;s as a Classics mistress and later, at age 27, moved to Bromley High School in southeast London where she began her writing in earnest. Cadogan shows that she was an excellent and committed teacher at both schools. Having contracted poliomyelitis in 1923 she was left without the use of her right leg. She gave up her teaching career and began to write full-time.
She never married and had no children; she was an aunt and a great-aunt. Her &quot;William&quot; stories and her other literature were extremely successful and, three years after she retired from teaching, Crompton was able to afford to have a house (The Glebe) built in Bromley Common for herself and her mother, Clara.

Crompton died in 1969 at the age of 78, after a heart attack, in Farnborough Hospital.

Crompton left the copyright of all her books to her niece, Mrs Richmal C. L. Ashbee of Chelsfield, Kent; along with £57,623.

==Work==
Crompton&#x27;s best known books are the &quot;William&quot; stories, about a mischievous 11-year-old schoolboy and his band of friends, known as &quot;The Outlaws&quot;. Her first published short story featuring William was &quot;Rice Mould Pudding&quot;, published in &quot;Home Magazine&quot; in 1919. (She had written &quot;The Outlaws&quot; in 1917, but it was not published until later.) In 1922, the first collection, entitled &quot;Just William&quot;, was published. She wrote 38 other &quot;William&quot; books throughout her life. The last, &quot;William the Lawless&quot;, was published posthumously in 1970.

The William books sold over 12 million copies in the United Kingdom alone. They have been adapted for films, stage-plays, and numerous radio and television series. Illustrations by Thomas Henry contributed to their success.

Crompton saw her &quot;real&quot; work as writing adult fiction. Starting with &quot;The Innermost Room&quot; (1923), she wrote 41 novels for adults and published nine collections of short stories. Their focus was generally village life in the Home Counties. Though these novels have the same inventiveness and lack of sentimentality as the &#x27;William&#x27; books, after the Second World War such literature had an increasingly limited appeal.

Even &quot;William&quot; was originally created for a grown-up audience, as she saw &quot;Just William&quot; as a potboiler. She was pleased by its success, but seemed frustrated that her other novels and short stories did not receive the same recognition. Her first published story was published in &quot;The Girl&#x27;s Own Paper&quot; in 1918, concerning a little boy named Thomas, a forerunner of William who reacts against authority. Crompton tried several times to reformulate William for other audiences. &quot;Jimmy&quot; (1949) was aimed at younger children, and &quot;Enter – Patricia&quot; (1927) at girls. Crompton wrote two more &quot;Jimmy&quot; books, but no more &quot;Patricia&quot;, and neither was as successful as &quot;William&quot;.

Crompton never disclosed the source of inspiration for the main character William; different opinions exist. According to the actor John Teed, whose family lived next door to Crompton, the model for William was Crompton&#x27;s nephew Tommy:
Crompton&#x27;s fiction centres around family and social life, dwelling on the constraints that they place on individuals while also nurturing them. This is best seen in her depiction of children as puzzled onlookers of society&#x27;s ways. Nevertheless, the children, particularly William and his Outlaws, almost always emerge triumphant.

The &quot;William&quot; books have been translated into sixteen or seventeen languages.

==Legacy==
Richmal Crompton&#x27;s archives are held at Roehampton University, London and at Wat Tyler Country Park, Pitsea, where some members of her family lived. A public house in Bromley is named in her honour and contains framed prints and texts from the William series.

The novel and TV series &quot;Good Omens&quot; by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett was inspired by Just William, with the premise being the Antichrist in the place of William, and his gang (&quot;The Them&quot;) in place of &quot;The Outlaws&quot;. The initial working title for the novel was &quot;William the Antichrist&quot;. Another of Pratchett&#x27;s works, the Johnny Maxwell series, was also inspired by Just William, Pratchett stating that it was based very loosely on an idea of what Just William would be like in a 1990s setting.

<doc id="213532" wikidata="Q508362" url="?curid=213532" title="Nice Observatory">
<text>The Nice Observatory () is an astronomical observatory located in Nice, France on the summit of Mount Gros. The observatory was founded in 1879, by the banker Raphaël Bischoffsheim. The architect was Charles Garnier, and Gustave Eiffel designed the main dome.

In 1886 the largest refracting (i.e., with an objective lens rather than a mirror) telescope in the World made its debut at Nice Observatory, the &quot;Grand Lunette.&quot;

== Description ==

The refractor telescope made by Henry and Gautier became operational around 1886–1887,
was the largest in a privately funded observatory, and the first at such high altitude ( above sea level). It was slightly bigger in aperture, several metres longer, and located at a higher altitude than the new (1895) at Pulkovo observatory in the Russian Empire, and the at Vienna Observatory (completed early 1880s).
In the records for the largest refracting telescopes, all three were outperformed by the refractor installed at the Lick Observatory at 1,283 m altitude in 1889.

== History ==

The first studies for the construction of the observatory began in 1878. Raphaël Bischoffsheim, a banker passionate about science and astronomy, purchased the summit of Mont-Gros to establish an observatory. He enlisted his friend Charles Garnier to lead the architectural project. Garnier, drawing on his background in botany, designed a beautiful landscaped environment. The site consists of 18 pavilions, 13 of which were designed by Charles Garnier. Among the buildings are the large equatorial, the small equatorial housing a 50 cm diameter equatorial instrument that enabled astronomer Auguste Charlois to discover 140 minor planets, the bent equatorial, the large meridian with its two sloped, zenith-opening roofs, and the central pavilion housing a library and researchers&#x27; offices. All of these buildings are nestled among the botanical paths of the garden and an olive grove with 250 trees purchased by Garnier.

In 1986, the Nice Observatory merged with the Center for Research in Geodynamics and Astrometry (CERGA) to form the Observatory of the Alpes-Maritimes, which became the Observatory of the Côte d&#x27;Azur in 1988.

Since 1988, the observatory site has been listed in the ZNIEFF (Natural Zone of Ecological, Faunistic, and Floristic Interest) inventory of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region. The entire site is part of the ZNIEFF titled &quot;Mont-Gros - Eze - Tête de Chien,&quot; which spans ten municipalities and covers an area of 2,907 hectares. On July 6, 1992, the site was partially classified as a historic monument, and on October 24, 1994, the buildings were fully classified, including the various telescopes. On March 1, 2001, the observatory received the &quot;20th Century Heritage&quot; label.

== Directors and Associated Personalities ==

The observatory has had the following directors:

* Henri Perrotin (1880–1904)
* General J. A. L. Bassot (1904–1917)
* Gaston Fayet (1917–1962)
* Jean-Claude Pecker (1962–1969)

== The Great Refracting Telescope called &quot;the Grande Lunette&quot; ==

The main instrument of the Nice Observatory is the refracting telescope housed in the Grand Equatorial. It is 18 meters long, with a 76 cm diameter lens. It became operational for the first time in 1888 and was, at the time, the largest refracting telescope in the world. It was later surpassed by the telescope at the Lick Observatory, which has a 91 cm diameter lens.

== In popular culture ==

The Nice Observatory was featured in the 1999 film &quot;Simon Sez&quot;. It was also the setting for the title scene in the 2014 Woody Allen flick &quot;Magic in the Moonlight&quot;.

On May 7, 2021, French artist French79 recorded a concert there, which was broadcast on Arte Concert.

In 2018, the exteriors in front of the Great Dome and the Grand Meridian served as the backdrop for Angèle&#x27;s music video &quot;La Thune&quot;.

In 2022, the band Hyphen Hyphen, originally from Nice, filmed the music video for &quot;Too Young&quot; at the observatory.

<doc id="213538" wikidata="Q16302931" url="?curid=213538" title="N connector">
<text>The N connector (also, type-N connector) is a threaded, weatherproof, medium-size RF connector used to join coaxial cables. It was one of the first connectors capable of carrying microwave-frequency signals, and was invented in the 1940s by Paul Neill of Bell Labs, after whom the connector is named.

==Design==

The interface specifications for the N and many other connectors are referenced in MIL-STD-348. Originally, the connector was designed to carry signals at frequencies up to 1 GHz in military applications, but today&#x27;s common Type N easily handles frequencies up to 11 GHz. More recent precision enhancements to the design by Julius Botka at Hewlett-Packard have pushed this to 18 GHz. The male connector is hand-tightened (though versions with a hex nut are also available) and has an air gap between the center and outer conductors. The coupling has a -24 UNEF thread. Amphenol suggests tightening to a torque of , while Andrew Corporation suggest for their hex nut variant. As torque limit depends only on thread quality and cleanliness, whereas the main operational requirement is good RF contact without significant steps or gaps, these values should be seen as indicative rather than critical.

==Power rating==
The &quot;peak&quot; power rating of an N connector is determined by voltage breakdown/ionisation of the air near the center pin. The &quot;average&quot; power rating is determined by overheating of the centre contact due to resistive insertion loss, and thus is a function of frequency. Typical makers&#x27; curves for a new clean connector with a perfect load (VSWR=1.0) give limits of ≈5000 W at 20 MHz and ≈500 W at 2 GHz.
This square root frequency derating law is expected from the skin depth decreasing with frequency. At lower frequencies the same maker recommends an upper bound of ≈1000 V RMS.
To achieve reliable operation in practice over an extended period, a safety factor of 5 or more is not uncommon, particularly when generic parts may be substituted, or the operating environment is likely to lead to eventual tarnishing of the contacts.

==Impedance options==
The N connector follows MIL-STD-348, a standard defined by the US military, and comes in 50 and 75 ohm versions. The 50 ohm version is widely used in the infrastructure of land mobile, wireless data, paging and cellular systems. The 75 ohm version is primarily used in the infrastructure of cable television systems. Connecting these two different types of connectors to each other can lead to damage, and/or intermittent operation due to the difference in diameter of the center pin.

Unfortunately, many type N connectors are not labeled, and it can be difficult to prevent this situation in a mixed impedance environment. The situation is further complicated by some makers of 75 ohm sockets designing them with enough spring yield to accept the larger 50 ohm pin without irreversible damage, while others do not. In general a 50 ohm socket is not damaged by a 75 ohm pin, but the loose fit means the contact quality is not guaranteed; this can cause poor or intermittent operation, with the thin 75 ohm male pin only barely mating with the larger 50 ohm socket in the female.

The 50 ohm type N connector is favored in microwave applications and microwave instrumentation, such as spectrum analyzers. 50 ohm N connectors are also commonly used on amateur radio devices (e.g., transceivers) operating in UHF bands.

==Variations==
===SnapN===
SnapN was originally designed by Rosenberger Hochfrequenztechnik in 2006 and is a quick locking replacement for the threaded interface of the widely applied Type N connector. Though part of the Quick Lock Formula Alliance (QLF), engineers at Rosenberger independently designed the SnapN in order to correct the performance problems of QLF&#x27;s version of the quick lock N connector, QN. This design achieves better electronic performance because, unlike the QN, this new version maintains the basic structural parameters of the original Type N in which the inner dimensions of the outer conductor are 7.00 mm, and the inner conductor&#x27;s outer dimensions are 3.04 mm. A male N-connector can plug into a female SnapN.

===Left-hand thread===
The left-hand thread, or reverse thread, uses the same -24 UNEF thread size but threaded in the opposite direction. These are used for some wireless LAN systems.

===Reverse-polarity N===
The reverse-polarity connectors use the same outer shell, but change the gender of the inner pin. These are used for some wireless LAN systems.

===HN===
The HN connector is slightly larger (¾&quot;-20 thread) and is designed for high-voltage applications.

==Applications==
Type N connectors find wide use in many lower frequency microwave systems, where ruggedness and/or low cost are needed. Many spectrum analyzers use such connectors for their inputs, and antennas which operate in the 0-11 GHz range often connect to a coaxial cable with type N connections. 

N connectors were historically used with 10BASE5 &quot;thicknet&quot; Ethernet. Some Medium Attachment Units had both male and female N connectors, allowing the MAU to come in between two N connector-capped thick coaxial cables for effective passthrough. However, MAU attachment to uninterrupted cables via vampire taps was more typical.

<text>Lake Louise is a hamlet within Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada. Named after Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, it lies in Alberta&#x27;s Rockies on the Bow River, northeast of the lake that shares its name. Initially settled in 1884 as an outpost for the Canadian Pacific Railway, Lake Louise sits at an elevation of , making it Canada&#x27;s highest community. The nearby lake, framed by mountains, is one of the most famous mountain vistas in the world.

== History ==
Prior to the arrival of Europeans, local indigenous peoples were the only inhabitants of the foothills of the Rocky Mountains—including what is today Lake Louise—where they hunted the once-widespread bison, as well as elk, moose and other big and small game animals, in addition to fishing the rich waterways and foraging off of the many species of edible and medicinal plants in the region. In the language of the Nakoda people, Lake Louise is called , meaning &quot;lake of the little fishes&quot;.

During the 1870s, construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) began, with the route going through Bow Valley. A Nakoda guide took CPR workman Tom Wilson to the site in 1882, and Wilson named it &#x27;Emerald Lake&#x27;. The hamlet was later called &#x27;Holt City&#x27;, and then &#x27;Laggan&#x27;, before being renamed Lake Louise. A ca. 1890 CPR station was replaced in 1910, but continued to be used by the railway company for other purposes until it was donated to Heritage Park Historical Village, Calgary, in 1976. The depot was moved to the park, where it was restored in the style of the era when the village was called Laggan. The 1910 station was declared a heritage railway station by the federal government in 1991, having been well-preserved and operating today as a restaurant.

Lake Louise was added to Rocky Mountains Park in 1892, and has subsequently become an international tourist destination, made more accessible by its location near the Trans-Canada Highway.

== Geography ==

The hamlet is in Division No. 15, one of 19 census divisions of Alberta and the federal riding of Banff—Airdrie. It is beside the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1), west of Calgary.

The background of Lake Louise is filled with views of several snow-capped mountains, including Mount Temple, Mount Whyte, and Mount Niblock.

=== Climate ===
Lake Louise experiences a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfc&quot;). Annual snowfall averages and although winter temperatures can fall below in January and February the averages are and respectively. Summers consist of frosty mornings and crisp, cool days. Snow can occur in any month of the year. Since lower elevations on said latitude have humid continental climates instead, it may also be described as a subalpine climate. Because of its high diurnal air temperature variation and high altitude, the frost-free period averages only 14 days.

== Demographics ==
Lake Louise recorded a population of 691 in the 2011 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada. Residents often change year to year, with workers in the service and tourism industries moving to the area for work.

== Attractions ==

Lake Louise features a shopping centre named Samson Mall. Lake Louise Ski Resort, a downhill ski area, is located across Highway 1. Chateau Lake Louise is southwest of the community on the shores of the lake.

== Government ==
Lake Louise is administered by Improvement District No. 9.

== Infrastructure ==
The Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) runs adjacent to the community while Highway 1A begins at the entrance to the community. The southern terminus of the Icefields Parkway (Highway 93) is just north of the community.

<doc id="213546" wikidata="Q826027" url="?curid=213546" title="Cyanocitta">
<text>Cyanocitta is a genus of birds in the family Corvidae, a family which contains the crows, jays and magpies. The genus includes two crested jays with blue plumage and a distinctive feather crest. Found only in temperate North America, the Rocky Mountains divide the two species. These jays inhabit deciduous, mixed, and coniferous forests, feeding mainly on seeds, invertebrates, and small vertebrates, with occasional human food. As omnivores, they breed from spring to early summer, nesting in treetops or bushes with clutches of three to six eggs. They are the only American corvids that use mud in nest-building. Despite their similarities, the two species differ in migratory behavior, socialization, and mating habits.

==Description==
Crested jays are relatively slender corvids with similar body shapes but differ in size. Steller’s jay is larger than the blue jay. Their strong black beaks have a small hooked tip and minimal bristles. They have slightly rounded, medium-to-long tails and relatively short wings. A feathered crest is more pronounced in Steller&#x27;s jay. Both species are blue, black, and white with distinct black-banded tails and wings—a unique trait among American corvids. Males are slightly larger, but both sexes have similar coloring.

===Flight===
Steller’s jay has powerful, steady wing beats, while the blue jay’s long-distance flight includes flatter beats, alternating with gliding over short distances. Both species prefer hopping over walking on the ground and are agile in trees.

===Vocalization===
Crested jays have diverse vocal repertoires, from croaks and energetic calls to melodic sounds. Both species are skilled imitators, mimicking buzzard calls, other birds, mammals, and even mechanical noises. The purpose of this mimicry in the wild is still debated.

==Systematics==
Established by Hugh Edwin Strickland in 1845, it contains the following species and subspecies:


The name &quot;Cyanocitta&quot; is a combination of the Greek words &quot;kuanos&quot;, meaning &quot;dark blue&quot;, and &quot;kitta&quot;, meaning &quot;jay&quot;.

==Distribution==
Crested jays inhabit temperate North America, divided by the North American Cordillera. This distribution likely resulted from glaciation during the last ice age. The blue jay occupies the flat eastern regions up to the Rocky Mountains, while the Steller&#x27;s jay is found in the western mountains and adjacent temperate areas. Both species overlap only in southwestern Canada, reaching the warm temperate zone&#x27;s northern edge in Canada and Alaska. They are absent in arid deserts, valleys, and coastal regions, with distribution becoming more fragmented to the south. Only the Steller&#x27;s jay extends into tropical regions, inhabiting cooler mountains as far south as Nicaragua. During the Pleistocene, it likely persisted in ice-free southern and western areas, spreading into the Rockies post-glaciation.

The two species differ in migratory habits: the Steller&#x27;s jay is primarily resident, moving only from high altitudes in winter, while the blue jay migrates seasonally, especially from northern regions. In southern areas, like Florida, blue jays are resident. Steller&#x27;s jays may migrate more widely after breeding seasons if food is scarce, with many juveniles moving to peripheral areas.

===Habitat===
Crested jays prefer open forests, forest edges, parklands, and urban green spaces, showing a strong preference for oak trees when available. Both species thrive in coniferous and mixed forests, with blue jays also frequenting pure deciduous forests. Blue jays adapt well to urban areas, often reaching higher densities than in forests, while Steller&#x27;s jays are less common in human-populated areas, preferring altitudes between 1,000 and 3,500 meters. Blue jays, in contrast, range widely, from coastal beaches to the Appalachian Mountains.

<text>Thousand Islands National Park (established 1904), formerly known as the St. Lawrence Islands National Park, is a Canadian National Park located on the 1000 Islands Parkway in the Thousand Islands Region of the Saint Lawrence River. The islands are actually the worn-down tops of ancient mountains. This region, the Frontenac Axis, connects the Canadian Shield from Algonquin Park in Ontario to the Adirondack Mountains in New York.

The park consists of 21 islands plus many smaller islets, 2 mainland properties and a visitor centre at Mallorytown, Ontario on the mainland. It is one of Canada&#x27;s smallest national parks with a total area of .

Much of the park is only accessible by boat. Trail systems can be found on the mainland along the 1000 Islands Parkway at Mallorytown Landing, Jones Creek and Landon Bay. There are picnic, camping and oTENTik facilities on several islands and at Mallorytown Landing. Mallorytown Landing is a day use area that offers a large parking, a boat ramp, several oTENTiks, picnic gazebos, playground, animal exhibits, travelling exhibits, and interpreters.

The Frontenac Arch Biosphere Reserve, in which the park is located, is known for being the most biodiverse region in Canada.

==History==
The first inhabitants of the park area are thought to have been hunting and fishing peoples who arrived following the last glacial period approximately 10,000 years ago. Many artifacts have been found in the park, including a 2500-year-old pot that was found by a diver in 1979. Pictographs are still visible on some shoreline cliffs.

By the early 17th century, the Iroquois people had put up large summer encampments on the riverbanks from which they fished the rich waters. Around this time the area began to be visited by French explorers, fur traders, and missionaries following the St Lawrence river to seek their fortune in the new world. Following the American Revolution at the end of the 18th century, European settlers began moving into the area and the traditional fishing encampments were displaced. A few Iroquois still returned to fish, but by the 1860s fish stocks were greatly depleted.

During the War of 1812, the area of today&#x27;s National Park was visited by both British and American warships. A British gunboat was sunk nearby and the preserved hull was raised in 1967. It now resides at the park. Martello towers were built in the area to defend the British from American invasion. Inside the park, Cedar Island, a small island visible from downtown Kingston, Ontario, is the site of a Martello tower named Cathcart Tower.

The park was established in 1904, the first Canadian national park east of the Rocky Mountains. It was called &quot;St. Lawrence Islands National Park&quot; until 2013, when it was renamed to &quot;Thousand Islands National Park&quot; to reflect the natural area in the name.

In 1997, the park was named one of the national parks with the highest levels of ecological impairment.

Since 2019, the park has hosted experimental theatre performances on Cedar Island, as part of The Kick &amp; Push Festival.

==Fauna==
Animals that inhabit this national park are coyotes, deer, porcupines, beavers, foxes, skunks, raccoons, turkey vultures, rabbits, squirrels, chickadees, and weasels.

<text>Montbéliard (; traditional ) is a town in the Doubs department in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region in eastern France, about from the border with Switzerland. It is one of the two subprefectures of the department.

==History==

Montbéliard is mentioned as early as 983 as . The County of Montbéliard or Mömpelgard was a feudal county of the Holy Roman Empire from 1033 to 1796. In 1283, it was granted rights under charter by Count Reginald. Its charter guaranteed the county perpetual liberties and franchises which lasted until the French Revolution in 1789.

Montbéliard&#x27;s original municipal institutions included the Magistracy of the Nine Bourgeois, the Corp of the Eighteen and the Notables, a Mayor, and Procurator, and appointed &quot;Chazes&quot;, who all participated in the administration of the county as provided by the charter. Also under the 1283 charter, the Count and the people of Montbéliard were required by law to defend Montbéliard, while citizens of Montbéliard were not required to fight in any wars outside of the county. Altogether, the charter lent Montbéliard a democratic air remarkable for its time.

In 1397 the county passed by marriage of Henriette, heiress of the county to Eberhard IV, Count of Württemberg, to the House of Württemberg.

In 1520, Duke Ulrich of Württemberg was ousted from the duchy by the Swabian League, and retreated to Montbéliard, the only territory he still possessed. From there on, Ulrich used Montbéliard as a base of operations to raise troops to retake Württemberg, but, in dire need of funds, he decided to lease Montbéliard to his half-brother George. In 1534, still in need of funds, Ulrich simply sold Montbéliard to Francis I of France, though with the right to repurchase, which Ulrich exercised after his restoration to Württemberg in 1536. Still governing Montbéliard as its count, George attempted to strengthen Lutheranism in the county, eventually succeeding in suppressing the other confessions fully.

From 1598 to 1608, the architect Heinrich Schickhardt built several landmarks in the city, including St. Martin, a castle, a bridge, a college and several hotels.

After the French Revolution, Montbéliard was briefly incorporated into the Rauracian Republic. In 1793 the town was annexed to France, which was confirmed in 1796 and by the German Mediatisation of 1806, when Württemberg was compensated with other areas, and became a kingdom.

As a consequence of the former rule under the dukes of Württemberg, it has been for centuries one of the few Protestant enclaves in France. The Württemberg coat of arms from 1495 represents Montbéliard as two jumping fish on a red field.

==Population==

As of 2021, Montbéliard proper has nearly 26,000 inhabitants, but it is at the center of a larger urban area (&quot;aire d&#x27;attraction d&#x27;une ville&quot;) with a population of 180,000. This urban area covers 137 communes, of which several in the adjacent departments of Haute-Saône (notably Héricourt) and Territoire de Belfort.

==Administration==

The Hôtel de Ville was completed in 1776.
==Economy==
Montbéliard and the surrounding region constitute an important manufacturing centre mainly based on metallurgy and the car industry.

The main manufacturing plant of the Peugeot automobile company is partly located in Montbéliard and has around 20,000 employees. In the area, the automotive industry accounts for 34,000 employees in more than 100 companies. The Peugeot company&#x27;s museum is located in the adjacent commune of Sochaux.

Montbéliard is the centre of the &#x27;Pays de Montbéliard&#x27;, a metropolitan area of 132,000 inhabitants.

==Main sights==
* The Château de Montbéliard, the castle of the Dukes of Württemberg.
As the residence of the Counts of Montbéliard, the history of the castle is closely linked with the story of the families that reigned over the county for more than eight centuries. Built on a rocky promontory at the confluence of the Lizaine and Allan valleys, this stronghold, which already existed in the 10th century, was constantly transformed during the course of the centuries. Today, on the northern side of the edifice, one can admire the Henriette Tower (reconstructed by Countess Henriette in approximately 1424), the Frédéric Tower (1572 and 1595) and the main building dating back to the 18th century. The castle has become the Museum of the Castle of the Dukes of Württemberg, which includes a historical tour, an important archaeological department whose collections come mainly from excavations of local Gallo-Roman sites, the Cuvier natural history gallery and exhibits of paintings and sculptures of international renown. On the esplanade of the Castle, the Clock pavilion or Hôtel du Bailli (Bailli&#x27;s quarters, also known as the gentlemen&#x27;s quarters), built according to plans of the architect Schickhardt at the beginning of the 17th century, houses today the Academy of Music.

* The Museum of Art and History Beurnier Rossel.
The Beurnier-Rossel mansion, located opposite St. Martin&#x27;s church, near the Hôtel de Ville, stands as a witness to the lifestyle of the urban bourgeoisie during the 18h and 19th centuries. Today it houses the Museum of Art and History. The restored 18th-century reception rooms on the first floor contain furniture, paintings, chandeliers and draperies which recreate the ambience of a private residence. On the second floor, there is an exhibit of objects relating to the history of the town and local life (bibles, liturgical vessels, traditional headdresses etc.) and the collection of music boxes made by L&#x27;Épée is exhibited in the attic.

* Saint-Martin Protestant Church.
Saint Martin Protestant Church was built between 1601 and 1607 and is the work of Heinrich Schickhardt, the architect of Frederic 1st Prince of Montbéliard, in its purest form. It is also the oldest church in France dedicated to the Reformation form of worship.

* Saint Maimboeuf Church.
Built between 1850 and 1875 on the Cardinal Mathieu&#x27;s request to assert the Catholic reconquest over Lutheranism, Saint Maimboeuf Church dominates the town. It includes rich façade adornments and a polychrome altarpiece.

== Climate ==

Due to its interior position within France, Montbéliard features an oceanic climate (Cfb), bordering on a warm-summer humid continental climate (Dfb), under the Köppen system. This leads to cold, snowy winters and warm to hot, humid summers.

==Sport==

Montbeliard&#x27;s most popular sports club is FCSM (Football Club Sochaux-Montbéliard).
Founded in 1928, FC Sochaux-Montbéliard was a founder member of the French professional Football League. The club has played a record 62 seasons in Ligue 1, the most of any club in the French football league system. This consistency contributed to the fact that FCSM, though a small club, has won all the possible national trophies.

FC Sochaux-Montbéliard honours:
* League Champions of France in 1935 and 1938
* League runners-up in 1937, 1953 and 1980
* Champions of the French Second Division in 1947 and 2001
* French Cup winners in 1937 and 2007
* French Cup runners-up in 1959, 1967 and 1988
* League Cup winners in 2004
* League Cup runners-up in 2003
* Coupe Drago (former French League Cup) winners in 1953, 1963 and 1964

<doc id="213555" wikidata="Q13403028" url="?curid=213555" title="Solar updraft tower">
<text>The solar updraft tower (SUT) is a design concept for a renewable-energy power plant for generating electricity from low temperature solar heat. Sunshine heats the air beneath a very wide greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central base of a very tall chimney tower. The resulting convection causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the chimney effect. This airflow drives wind turbines, placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base, to produce electricity.

As of mid 2018, although several prototype models have been built, no full-scale practical units are in operation. Scaled-up versions of demonstration models are planned to generate significant power. They may also allow development of other applications, such as to agriculture or horticulture, to water extraction or distillation, or to remediate urban air pollution .

Commercial investment may have been discouraged by the high initial cost of building a very large novel structure, the large land area required, and the risk of investment. A few prototypes have recently been built in Spain in 1981, in Iran in 2011, and in China in 2010 (see below), and projects were proposed for parts of Africa, the US and Australia.

In 2014, National Geographic published a popular update, including an interview with an informed engineering proponent. A solar updraft tower power plant can generate electricity from the low temperature atmospheric heat gradient between ground or surface level and structurally reachable altitude. Functional or mechanical feasibility is now less of an issue than capitalisation. A comprehensive review of theoretical and experimental aspects of &quot;solar updraft tower power plant&quot; (SUTPP) development is available, recommending commercial development. A review of progress in demonstration and modelled data was presented in 2020 by Dogan Eyrener, and included in publication of proceedings. A review of combined technologies to address intermittency of power output, of hybrid solar updraft tower with complementary technologies was published in 2022. Combined, multiple or hybrid technologies include combined updraft-downdraft towers, and solar updraft-gas turbine waste heat transfer.

== Design ==
Power output depends primarily on two factors: collector area and chimney height. A larger area collects and warms a greater volume of air to flow up the chimney; collector areas as large as in diameter have been discussed. A larger chimney height increases the pressure difference via the stack effect; chimneys as tall as have been discussed.

Heat is stored inside the collector area allowing SUTs to operate 24 hours a day. The ground beneath the solar collector, water in bags or tubes, or a saltwater thermal sink in the collector could add thermal capacity and inertia to the collector. Humidity of the updraft and release of the latent heat of condensation in the chimney could increase the energy flux of the system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solar pond tower for 5 €ct/kWh&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Turbines with a horizontal axis can be installed in a ring around the base of the tower, as once planned for an Australian project and seen in the diagram above; or—as in the prototype in Spain—a single vertical axis turbine can be installed inside the chimney.

A nearly negligible amount of carbon dioxide is produced as part of operations, while construction material manufacturing can create emissions. Net energy payback is estimated to be 2–3 years.

Since solar collectors occupy significant amounts of land, deserts and other low-value sites are most likely. Improvements in the solar heat collection efficiency by using unglazed transpired collector can significantly reduce the land required for the solar array.

A small-scale solar updraft tower may be an attractive option for remote regions in developing countries. The relatively low-tech approach could allow local resources and labour to be used for construction and maintenance.

Locating a tower at high latitudes could produce up to 85 percent of the output of a similar plant located closer to the equator, if the collection area is sloped significantly toward the equator. The sloped collector field, which also functions as a chimney, is built on suitable mountainsides, with a short vertical chimney on the mountaintop to accommodate the vertical axis air turbine. The results showed that solar chimney power plants at high latitudes may have satisfactory thermal performance.

== History and progress ==

A chimney turbine was envisioned as a smoke jack, and illustrated 500 years ago by Leonardo da Vinci. An animal spitted above a fire or in an oven could be turned by a vertical axis turbine with four angled vanes in the chimney updraft.

Alfred Rosling Bennett published the first patent describing a &quot;Convection Mill&quot; in 1896. Even if in the title of the patent and in the claims the word &quot;Toy&quot; clearly appears and even if in the overall description made inside the patent it is evident that the idea was to produce small devices, in page 3 at lines 49–54 Bennett envisions much larger devices for bigger scale applications. A model of this &quot;convection mill&quot;, built in 1919 by Albert H. Holmes &amp; Son (London) to demonstrate the phenomenon of convection currents, is on display in the Science Museum, London.

In 1903, Isidoro Cabanyes, a colonel in the Spanish army, proposed a solar chimney power plant in the magazine &quot;La energía eléctrica&quot;. Another early description was published in 1931 by German author Hanns Günther. Beginning in 1975, Robert E. Lucier applied for patents on a solar chimney electric power generator; between 1978 and 1981 patents (since expired) were granted in Australia, Canada, Israel, and the US.

In 1926 Prof Engineer Bernard Dubos proposed to the French Academy of Sciences the construction of a Solar Aero-Electric Power Plant in North Africa with its solar chimney on the slope of a large mountain. 

In 1956, Edgard Nazare, after observing several dust devils in the southern Sahara, filed his first patent in Algiers on the artificial cyclone generator. This patent was re-filed later in Paris 

In 1982, a small-scale experimental model of a solar draft tower was built in Manzanares, Ciudad Real, 150 km south of Madrid, Spain at . The power plant operated for approximately eight years. The tower&#x27;s guy-wires were not protected against corrosion and failed due to rust and storm winds. The tower blew over and was decommissioned in 1989.

Inexpensive materials were used in order to evaluate their performance. The solar tower was built of iron plating only thick under the direction of a German engineer, Jörg Schlaich. The project was funded by the German government.

The chimney had a height of and a diameter of with a collection area (greenhouse) of and a diameter of , obtaining a maximum power output of about 50 kW. Various materials were used for testing, such as single or double glazing or plastic (which turned out not to be durable enough). One section was used as an actual greenhouse. During its operation, 180 sensors measured inside and outside temperature, collecting humidity and wind speed data on a second-by-second basis. This experimental setup did not sell energy.

In December 2010, a tower in Jinshawan in Inner Mongolia, China started operation, producing 200 kilowatts. The 1.38 billion RMB (USD 208 million) project was started in May 2009. It was intended to cover and produce 27.5 MW by 2013, but had to be scaled back. The solar chimney plant was expected to improve the climate by covering loose sand, restraining sandstorms. Critics have said that the 50m tall tower is too short to work properly and that it was a mistake to use glass in metal frames for the collector, as many of them cracked and shattered in the heat.

A proposal to construct a solar updraft tower in Fuente el Fresno, Ciudad Real, Spain, entitled &quot;Ciudad Real Torre Solar&quot; would be the first of its kind in the European Union and would stand tall, covering an area of .
It is expected to produce 40 MW. At that height, it would be nearly twice as tall as the Belmont TV Mast, which was once the tallest structure in the European Union, before being shortened by 24 meter.

In 2001, EnviroMission proposed to build a solar updraft tower power generating plant known as &quot;Solar Tower Buronga&quot; near Buronga, New South Wales. The company did not complete the project. They have plans for a similar plant in Arizona, and most recently (December 2013) in Texas, but there is no sign of &#x27;breaking ground&#x27; in any of Enviromission&#x27;s proposals.

In December 2011, Hyperion Energy, controlled by Western Australians Tony Sage and Dallas Dempster, was reported to be planning to build a 1-km-tall solar updraft tower near Meekatharra to supply power to Mid-West mining projects.

In mid-2008, the Namibian government approved a proposal for the construction of a 400 MW solar chimney called the &#x27;Greentower&#x27;. The tower is planned to be tall and in diameter, and the base will consist of a greenhouse in which cash crops can be grown.

A model solar updraft tower was constructed in Turkey as a civil engineering project. Functionality and outcomes are obscure.

A second solar updraft tower using a transpired collector is operating at Trakya University in Edirne, Turkey, and is being used to test various innovations in SUT designs including the ability to recover heat from photovoltaic (PV) arrays.
A grade-school pupil&#x27;s home do-it-yourself SUT demonstration for a school science fair was constructed and studied in 2012, in a suburban Connecticut setting. With a 7-metre stack and 100 square metre collector, this generated a daily average 6.34 mW, from a computer fan as a turbine. Insolation and wind were the major factors on variance (range from 0.12 to 21.78 mW) in output.

In Xi&#x27;an, central China, a 60-metre urban chimney with surrounding collector has significantly reduced urban air pollution. This demonstration project was led by Cao Jun Ji, a chemist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences&#x27; Key Laboratory of Aerosol Chemistry and Physics. This work has since been published on, with performance data and modelling.

== Efficiency ==
The traditional solar updraft tower has a power conversion rate considerably lower than many other designs in the (high temperature) solar thermal group of collectors. The low conversion rate is balanced to some extent by the lower cost per square metre of solar collection.

Model calculations estimate that a 100 MW plant would require a 1,000 m tower and a greenhouse of . A 200 MW tower of the same height would require a collector 7 kilometres in diameter (total area of about ). One 200 MW power station will provide enough electricity for around 200,000 typical households and will abate over 900,000 tons of greenhouse producing gases from entering the environment annually. The glazed collector area is expected to extract about 0.5 percent, or 5 W/m2 of 1 kW/m2, of the solar energy that falls upon it. If a transpired solar collector is used in place of the glazed collector, the efficiency is doubled.

Additional efficiency improvements are possible by modifying the turbine and chimney design to increase air speed using a venturi configuration. Concentrating thermal (CSP) or photovoltaic (CPV) solar power plants range between 20% and 31.25% efficiency (dish Stirling). Overall CSP/CPV efficiency is reduced because collectors do not cover the entire footprint. Without further tests, the accuracy of these calculations is uncertain. Most of the projections of efficiency, costs and yields are calculated theoretically, rather than empirically derived from demonstrations, and are seen in comparison with other collector or solar heat transducing technologies.

An innovative concept recombining a thermal power plant dry cooling tower with a solar chimney was first introduced by Zandian and Ashjaee in 2013 to increase the efficiency of the solar updraft towers. This hybrid cooling-tower-solar-chimney (HCTSC) system was shown to be able to produce an over ten times increase in output power compared to the conventional solar chimney power plants like Manzanares, Ciudad Real, with similar geometrical dimensions. In addition, it was shown that with an increase in chimney diameter, the power generation can reach to MW-graded power output without the necessity of building huge individual solar chimney panels. The results showed a maximum of 3 MW power output from the HCTSC system which resulted in 0.37% increase in the thermal efficiency of a typical 250 MW fossil fuel power plant, with a chimney diameter of only . The new hybrid design made the solar updraft tower feasible again, and proved it to be economical in saving much construction cost and time. This concept also recaptures the heat of radiators that are thrown out into the atmosphere without efficient utilization, and prevents generation of excessive greenhouse gasses.

The performance of an updraft tower may be degraded by factors such as atmospheric winds, by drag induced by the bracings used for supporting the chimney, and by reflection off the top of the greenhouse canopy. However, updraft may be enhanced by crosswind at the upper level – creating a low pressure vortex across the top of the chimney would increase updraft.

== Related ideas and adaptations ==

===Updraft===
* The atmospheric vortex proposal replaces the physical chimney by a controlled or &#x27;anchored&#x27; cyclonic updraft vortex. Depending on the column gradient of temperature and pressure, or buoyancy, and stability of the vortex, very high-altitude updraft may be achievable. As an alternative to a solar collector, industrial and urban waste-heat could be used to initiate and sustain the updraft in the vortex.
* Telescopic or retractable design may lower a very high chimney for maintenance, or to prevent storm damage. Hot-air balloon chimney suspension has also been proposed.
* A form of solar boiler technology placed directly above the turbine at the base of the tower might increase the up-draught.
* Moreno (2006) proposed that a chimney can be economically placed on a hill or mountain slope. Klinkman (2014) elaborated on constructing diagonal chimneys. A structure as simply built as a high hoop tunnel, but much longer in length and on a slope, can permanently generate an airflow for producing electricity. Changing the chimney&#x27;s height differential from 200 m (the Manzanares experiment) to 2000 m (Charleston Peak in Nevada has a rise of over 2500 m, for example) will transfer a factor of ten more of captured solar heat into electric power. Increasing the temperature differential between chimney air and outside air by a factor of ten increases the same chimney&#x27;s power by one further factor of ten, assuming that the chimney&#x27;s walls are engineered to take the extra heat. Concentrating solar heat is often done with reflection.
* An inflatable solar chimney power plant has been evaluated analytically and simulated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling. This idea has been registered as a patent, including the optimal shape of the collector and the analytical profile for the self standing inflatable tower. The CFD simulation has been evaluated by verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ) of computer simulations by American Society of Mechanical Engineers 2009 standards.
* Airtower is a proposal by architect Julian Breinersdorfer to better exploit the high initial capital outlay of building a very high structure by incorporating it into a high rise building core. The proximity of producer and consumer can also reduce transmission losses.

===Collector===
* A saltwater thermal sink in the collector could &#x27;flatten&#x27; the diurnal variation in energy output, while airflow humidification in the collector and condensation in the updraft could increase the energy flux of the system.
* As with other solar technologies, some mechanism is required to mix its varying power output with other power sources. Heat can be stored in heat-absorbing material or saltwater ponds. Electricity can be cached in batteries or other technologies.
* A recent innovation has been the use of transpired collectors in place of the traditional glazing covers. Transpired collectors have efficiencies in the 60% to 80% range or three times the 25% efficiency measured with the greenhouse collectors. The large solar collector field can now be reduced to half or less making solar updraft towers much more cost effective. A patent has been granted on a solar tower system using transpired collectors.

===The Generator===
* If the chimney updraft is an ionized vortex, then the electro-magnetic field could be tapped for electricity, using the airflow and chimney as a generator.

===Applications===
* Release of humid ground-level air from an atmospheric vortex or solar chimney at altitude could form clouds or precipitation, potentially altering local hydrology. Some of these ideas originated in work by Niewiadomski and Haman who studied cooling tower dynamics. Local de-desertification, or afforestation could be achieved if a regional water cycle were established and sustained in an otherwise arid area.
* The solar cyclone distiller could extract atmospheric water by condensation in the updraft of the chimney. This solar cyclonic water distiller in the updraft above a solar collector pond could adapt the solar collector-chimney system for large-scale desalination of collected brine, brackish- or waste-water pooled in the collector base.
* Fitted with a vortex chimney scrubber, the updraft could be cleaned of particulate air pollution. An experimental demonstration tower is cleaning the air in a Chinese city with little external energy input. 
* Alternately to scrubbing, particulate air pollution caught in the updraft and released could serve as a nucleation stimulus for precipitation either in the chimney, or at release altitude as cloud seeds.
* Removal of urban air pollution raised and dispersed at altitude could reflect insolation, reducing ground-level solar warming.
* Energy production, water desalination or simple atmospheric water extraction could be used to support carbon-fixing or food-producing local agriculture, and for intensive aquaculture and horticulture under the solar collector as a greenhouse.
* A balloon-suspended lightweight extensible chimney anchored from an urban tether, rising from low level warm air to high altitude could remove low lying air pollution without the need for a broad collector at the base, given adequate height of release. This might improve air quality in highly polluted megacities without the burden and cost of major fixed construction.

== Capitalisation ==
A solar updraft power station would require a large initial capital outlay, but would have relatively low operating cost.

Capital outlays would be roughly the same as next-generation nuclear plants such as the AP-1000 at roughly $5 per watt of capacity. As with other renewable power sources, towers have no need for fuel. Overall costs are largely determined by interest rates and years of operation, varying from 5 eurocents per kWh for 4% and 20 years to 15 eurocents per kWh for 12% and 40 years.

Estimates of total costs range from 7 (for a 200 MW plant) and 21 (for a 5 MW plant) euro cents per kWh to 25–35 cents per kWh. The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is approximately 3 Euro cents per KWh for a 100 MW wind or natural gas plant. No actual data are available for a utility-scale power plant.

<text>Le Roman de la Rose (The Romance of the Rose) is a medieval poem written in Old French and presented as an allegorical dream vision. As poetry, &quot;The Romance of the Rose&quot; is a notable instance of courtly literature, purporting to provide a &quot;mirror of love&quot; in which the whole art of romantic love is disclosed. Its two authors conceived it as a psychological allegory; throughout the Lover&#x27;s quest, the word &quot;Rose&quot; is used both as the name of the titular lady and as an abstract symbol of female sexuality. The names of the other characters function both as personal names and as metonyms illustrating the different factors that lead to and constitute a love affair. Its long-lasting influence is evident in the number of surviving manuscripts of the work, in the many translations and imitations it inspired, and in the praise and controversy it inspired.

== Authorship ==
&quot;The Romance of the Rose&quot; was written in two stages by two authors. In the first stage of composition, circa 1230, Guillaume de Lorris wrote 4,058 verses describing a courtier&#x27;s attempts at wooing his beloved woman. The first part of the poem&#x27;s story is set in a walled garden, an example of a &quot;locus amoenus&quot;, a traditional literary topos in epic poetry and chivalric romance. Forty-five years later, circa 1275, in the second stage of composition, Jean de Meun or Jehan Clopinel wrote 17,724 additional lines, in which he expanded the roles of his predecessor&#x27;s allegorical personages, such as Reason and Friend, and added new ones, such as Nature and Genius. They, in encyclopedic breadth, discuss the philosophy of love.

==Reception==
===Early===
&quot;The Romance of the Rose&quot; was both popular and controversial. One of the most widely read works in France through the Renaissance, it was possibly the most read book in Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries. Its emphasis on sensual language and imagery, along with its supposed promulgation of misogyny, provoked attacks by Jean Gerson, Christine de Pizan, Pierre d&#x27;Ailly, and many other writers and moralists of the 14th and 15th centuries. The historian Johan Huizinga has written: &quot;It is astonishing that the Church, which so rigorously repressed the slightest deviations from dogma of a speculative character, suffered the teaching of this breviary of the aristocracy (for the &quot;Roman de la Rose&quot; was nothing else) to be disseminated with impunity.&quot;

===Modern===
Later reactions suggested that it had a somewhat encyclopedic quality. The nineteenth-century scholar and writer Gaston Paris wrote that it was &quot;an encyclopedia in disorder&quot;, the British author C. S. Lewis described it as having an &quot;encyclopedic character&quot;, and the Russian literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin wrote that the work was &quot;encyclopedic (and synthetic) in its content&quot;. One historian wrote that while the &quot;Roman de la Rose&quot; is obviously not an encyclopedia, &quot;it evokes one, represents one, dreams one, perhaps, with all its aspirations and limitations&quot;.

==Manuscripts and incunabula==
About three hundred manuscript copies are extant, one of the highest figures for a secular work. Many of these are illustrated, most with fewer than ten remaining illustrations, but there are a number with twenty or more illustrations, and the exceptional Burgundian British Library Harley MS 4425 has 92 large and high quality miniatures, despite a date around 1500; the text was copied by hand from a printed edition. These are by the artist known as the Master of the Prayer Books of around 1500, commissioned by Count Engelbert II of Nassau.

The peak period of production was the 14th century, but manuscript versions continued to be produced until the advent of printing, and indeed afterwards – there are at least seven manuscripts dated after 1500. There are also seven incunabula – printed editions before 1500 – the first from Geneva in about 1481, followed by two from the city of Lyons in the 1480s and four from Paris in the 1490s. An edition from Lyons in 1503 is illustrated with 140 woodcuts. Digital images of more than 140 of these manuscripts are available for study in the &quot;Roman de la Rose&quot; Digital Library.

==Translation and influence==
Part of the story was translated from its original Old French into Middle English as &quot;The Romaunt of the Rose&quot;, which had a great influence on English literature. Chaucer was familiar with the original French text, and a portion of the Middle English translation is thought to be his work. Critics suggest that the character of &quot;La Vieille&quot; acted as source material for Chaucer&#x27;s Wife of Bath. There were several other early translations into languages including Middle Dutch (Heinrik van Aken, c. 1280). &quot;Il Fiore&quot; is a &quot;reduction&quot; of the poem into 232 Italian sonnets by a &quot;ser Durante&quot;, sometimes thought to have been Dante, although this is generally thought unlikely. Dante never mentions the &quot;Roman&quot;, but is often said to have been highly conscious of it in his own work. In 1900, the pre-Raphaelite F. S. Ellis translated the whole of the poem into English verse, with the exception of a section describing a sexual encounter, which he included in an appendix in Old French with the note that he &quot;believes that those who will read them will allow that he is justified in leaving them in the obscurity of the original&quot;. C. S. Lewis&#x27;s 1936 study &quot;The Allegory of Love&quot; renewed interest in the poem. In 2023, an opera inspired by the poem was premiered by American composer Kate Soper.

<text>The Romaunt of the Rose (&quot;The Romaunt&quot;) is a partial translation into Middle English of the French allegorical poem, &quot;Le Roman de la Rose&quot; (&quot;Le Roman&quot;). Originally believed to be the work of Chaucer, &quot;the Romaunt&quot; inspired controversy among 19th-century scholars when parts of the text were found to differ in style from Chaucer&#x27;s other works. Also the text was found to contain three distinct fragments of translation. Together, the fragments—A, B, and C—provide a translation of approximately one-third of &quot;Le Roman&quot;.

There is little doubt that Chaucer did translate &quot;Le Roman de la Rose&quot; under the title &quot;The Romaunt of the Rose&quot;: in &quot;The Legend of Good Women&quot;, the narrator, Chaucer, states as much. The question is whether the surviving text is the same one that Chaucer wrote. The authorship question has been a topic of research and controversy. As such, scholarly discussion of the &quot;Romaunt &quot;has tended toward linguistic rather than literary analysis.

Scholars today generally agree that only fragment A is attributable to Chaucer, although fragment C closely resembles Chaucer&#x27;s style in language and manner. Fragment C differs mainly in the way that rhymes are constructed. And where fragments A and C adhere to a London dialect of the 1370s, Fragment B contains forms characteristic of a northern dialect.

== Source material: &quot;Le Roman de la Rose&quot; ==
Guillaume de Lorris completed the first 4,058 lines of &quot;le Roman de la Rose&quot; circa 1230. Written in Old French, in octosyllabic, iambic tetrameter couplets, the poem was an allegory of what D. S. Brewer called fine amour. About 40 years later, Jean de Meun continued the poem with 17,724 additional lines. In contrasting the two poets, C. S. Lewis noted that Lorris&#x27; allegory focused on aspects of love and supplied a subjective element to the literature, but Meun&#x27;s work was less allegory and more satire. Lewis believed that Meun provided little more than a lengthy series of digressions.

== Writing work and characteristics ==
Geoffrey Chaucer began translating &quot;Le Roman&quot; into Middle English early in his career, perhaps in the 1360s. Chaucer may have selected this particular work because it was highly popular both among Parisians and among French-speaking nobles in England. He might have intended to introduce the poem to an English audience as a way of revising or extending written English. Moreover, &quot;Le Roman&quot; was controversial in its treatment of women and sex, especially in the verses written by Meun. Chaucer may even have believed that English literature would benefit from this variety of literature.

Chaucer&#x27;s experience in translating &quot;Le Roman&quot; helped to define much of his later work. It is a translation which shows his understanding of French language. Russell Peck noted that Chaucer not only drew upon the poem for subject matter, but that he trained himself in the poem&#x27;s literary techniques and sensibilities. &quot;Le Roman&quot; enabled Chaucer to introduce a &quot;stylish wit and literary manner&quot; to his English audience and then to claim these attributes as his own.

&quot;The Romaunt&quot; is written in octosyllabic, iambic tetrameter couplets in the same meter as &quot;le Roman&quot;. The translation is one of near-minimal change from the original. Raymond Preston noted that &quot;a better poem in English would have meant a lesser translation.&quot;

An early fifteenth-century manuscript of &quot;the Romaunt of the Rose&quot; was included in the library William Hunter donated to the University of Glasgow in 1807.

In 1532, William Thynne published the first collected edition of Chaucer&#x27;s work. Commissioned by Henry VIII to search for copies of Chaucer&#x27;s manuscripts in the libraries and monasteries of England, Thynne printed a collection that included &quot;the Romaunt of the Rose&quot;.

== Analyses ==

=== Henry Bradshaw and Bernard ten Brink ===
By 1870, Henry Bradshaw had applied his method of studying rhymes to Chaucer&#x27;s poetry. Working independently, Bradshaw and Dutch philologist Bernard ten Brink concluded that the existing version of &quot;the Romaunt&quot; was not Chaucer&#x27;s translation of &quot;le Roman&quot;, and they placed the work on a list that included other disqualified poems no longer considered to have been written by Chaucer.

===Walter Skeat===

Citing research by both Linder and Kaluza, Walter Skeat, a nineteenth-century scholar, divided &quot;the Romaunt&quot; into the following three fragments that correspond to French text in &quot;le Roman&quot;:
&quot;Le Roman&quot; continues another 9,510 lines without a corresponding English translation in &quot;the Romaunt&quot;. When the 5,547 untranslated lines between fragments B and C are included, the English translation is roughly one-third of the original French poem.

Skeat subjected &quot;the Romaunt&quot; text to a number of tests, and he found that on average, fragment A required 101.6 lines of English poetry for every 100 lines of French poetry. Fragment C required 102.1 English lines for 100 French lines. But Fragment B required 117.5 English lines for 100 French lines. Skeat also found that a northern dialect was present in fragment B, where Chaucer almost exclusively used a London dialect. Fragment B also broke with Chaucer&#x27;s rule in rhyming words that end in &quot;y&quot;. Finally, Skeat discovered that where Chaucer did not employ assonant rhymes, fragment B depended upon them. These discoveries led nineteenth-century scholars to conclude that fragment B was not written by Chaucer.

Skeat found that Fragment C departs from Chaucer&#x27;s usage, beginning again with words ending in &quot;y&quot; that the author rhymed with words ending in &quot;ye&quot;. Where Chaucer rhymed the words &quot;wors&quot; and &quot;curs&quot; in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, the author of fragment C rhymed &quot;hors&quot; and &quot;wors&quot;. In what Skeat said would be a &quot;libellous&quot; attribution to Chaucer, the author of fragment C rhymed &quot;paci-ence&quot; with &quot;venge-aunce&quot; and &quot;force&quot; with &quot;croce&quot;. Fragment C rhymes &quot;abstinaunce&quot; with &quot;penaunce&quot; and later &quot;abstinence&quot; with &quot;sentence&quot;. These and other differences between fragment C and the works of Chaucer led Skeat to disqualify fragment C.

=== Later studies ===
Further research in the 1890s determined that the existing version of &quot;the Romaunt&quot; was composed of three individual fragments—A, B, and C--and that they were translations of &quot;le Roman&quot; by three different translators. The discussion about the authorship of &quot;the Romaunt of the Rose&quot; is by no means ended. In a recent metrical analysis of text, Xingzhong Li concluded that fragment C was in fact written by Chaucer or at least &quot;88% Chaucerian.&quot;

==Synopsis==
The story begins with an allegorical dream, in which the narrator receives advice from the god of love on gaining his lady&#x27;s favor. Her love being symbolized by a rose, he is unable to get to the rose.

The second fragment is a satire on the mores of the time, with respect to courting, religious order, and religious hypocrisy. In the second fragment, the narrator is able to kiss the rose, but then the allegorical character Jealousy builds a fortress encircling it so that the narrator does not have access to it.

The third fragment of the translation takes up the poem 5,000 lines after the second fragment ends. At its beginning, the god of love is planning to attack the fortress of Jealousy with his barons. The rest of the fragment is a confession given by Fals-Semblant, or false-seeming, which is a treatise on the ways in which men are false to one another, especially the clergy to their parishioners. The third fragment ends with Fals-Semblant going to the fortress of Jealousy in the disguise of a religious pilgrim. He speaks with Wikked-Tunge that is holding one of the gates of the fortress and convinces him to repent his sins. The poem ends with Fals-Semblant absolving Wikked-Tunge of his sins.

<doc id="213567" wikidata="Q184945" url="?curid=213567" title="Hastings Banda">
<text>Hastings Kamuzu Banda ( – 25 November 1997) was a Malawian politician and statesman who served as the leader of Malawi from 1964 to 1994. He served as Prime Minister from independence in 1964 to 1966, when Malawi was a Dominion/Commonwealth realm. In 1966, the country became a republic and he became the first president as a result, ruling until his defeat in 1994.

After receiving much of his education in ethnography, linguistics, history, and medicine overseas, Banda returned to Nyasaland to speak against colonialism and advocate independence from the United Kingdom. He was formally appointed Prime Minister of Nyasaland, and led the country to independence in 1964. Two years later, he proclaimed Malawi a republic with himself as the first president. He consolidated power and later declared Malawi a one-party state under the Malawi Congress Party (MCP). In 1970, the MCP made him the party&#x27;s President for Life. In 1971, he became president for Life of Malawi itself. A renowned anti-communist leader in Africa, he received support from the Western Bloc during the Cold War. He generally supported women&#x27;s rights, improved the country&#x27;s infrastructure and maintained a good educational system relative to other African countries.

However, he presided over one of the most repressive regimes in Africa, an era that saw political opponents regularly tortured and murdered. Human rights groups estimate that at least 6,000 people were killed, tortured and jailed without trial. As many as 18,000 people were killed during his rule, according to one estimate. His rule has been characterised as a &quot;highly repressive autocracy&quot;. He also received criticism for maintaining full diplomatic relations with the apartheid government in South Africa. By 1993, amid increasing domestic and international pressure, he agreed to hold a referendum which ended the one-party system. Soon afterwards, a special assembly ended his life-term presidency and stripped him of most of his powers. Banda ran for president in the democratic elections that followed and was defeated. He died in South Africa in 1997.

==Early life==
Kamuzu Banda was born Akim Kamnkhwala Mtunthama Banda near Kasungu in Malawi (then British Central Africa) to Mphonongo Banda and Akupingamnyama Phiri. His date of birth is unknown, as it took place when there was no birth registration documentation, but Banda himself often gave his date of birth as 14 May 1906. Later, when presented with evidence of certain tribal customs by a friend, Dr Donal Brody, Banda said: &quot;No one knows the hour, the date, the month or the year in which I was born, although I now accept the evidence that you give me – March or April 1898.&quot;

He left his village school near Mtunthama for his maternal grandparents&#x27; home and attended Chayamba Primary School in Chikondwa. In 1908, he moved to Chilanga mission station and was baptised in 1910.

The name Kamnkhwala, meaning &quot;little medicine&quot;, was replaced with Kamuzu, which means &quot;little root&quot;. The name Kamuzu was given to him because he was conceived after his mother had been given root herbs by a medicine man to cure infertility. He took the Christian name of Hastings after being baptised into the Church of Scotland by Dr George Prentice, a Scot, in 1910, naming himself after John Hastings, a Scottish missionary working near his village whom he admired. The prefix &quot;doctor&quot; was earned through his education.

Around 1915–16, he left home on foot with Hanock Msokera Phiri, an uncle who had been a teacher at the nearby Livingstonia mission school, for Hartley, Southern Rhodesia (now Chegutu, Zimbabwe). He apparently wanted to enroll at the famous Scottish Presbyterian Lovedale Missionary Institute in South Africa but completed his Standard 8 education without studying there. 

In 1917, he left on foot for Johannesburg in South Africa. He worked at the Witwatersrand Deep Mine on the Transvaal Reef for several years. During this time, he met Bishop William Tecumseh Vernon of the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) who offered to pay his tuition fee at a Methodist school in the United States if he could pay his own passage. In 1925, he left for New York.

==Life abroad (1925–1958)==

===United States===

Banda studied in the high school section of the Wilberforce Institute, an African American AME college (a member of AME), now known as Central State University, in Wilberforce, Ohio, and graduated in 1928 with a diploma. With his financial support now ended, Banda earned some money on speaking engagements arranged by the Ghanaian educationalist Kwegyir Aggrey, whom he had met in South Africa.

Speaking at a Kiwanis club meeting he met Dr Herald, with whose help he enrolled as a pre-medical student at Indiana University, where he lodged with Mrs W. N. Culmer. At Bloomington, he wrote several essays about his native Chewa tribe for the folklorist Stith Thompson, who introduced him to Edward Sapir, an anthropologist at the University of Chicago, to which, after four semesters, he transferred. During his period there, he collaborated with the Afro-American anthropologist and linguist Mark Hanna Watkins, providing information on his native Chewa language. This led to the publication of a grammar book of the language. In Chicago, he lodged with an African-American, Corinna Saunders. He majored in history, graduating with a B.Phil. degree in 1931.

During this time he enjoyed financial support from Mrs Smith, whose husband, Douglas Smith, had made fortunes from patent medicines and Pepsodent toothpaste and as a member of the Eastman Kodak board. He then, still with financial support from these and other benefactors (including Walter B. Stephenson of the Delta Electric Company), studied medicine at Meharry Medical College in Tennessee, from which he obtained an M.D. degree in 1937. Banda became the second Malawian person to receive a medical degree, following Daniel Sharpe Malekebu. While studying at Meharry Medical College in Tennessee, Banda married Robertine Edmonds in 1934.

===United Kingdom===

To practise medicine in territories of the British Empire, however, Banda was apparently required to gain a second medical degree; he attended the University of Edinburgh and was subsequently awarded a Scottish triple conjoint diploma (with post-nominals LRCP(Edin), LRCS(Edin) and LRCPSG) in 1941. His studies were funded by stipends of £300 per year from the government of Nyasaland (to facilitate his return there as a doctor) and from the Church of Scotland; neither of these benefactors was aware of the other. (There are conflicting accounts of this. He might still have been funded by Mrs Smith.) When he enrolled for courses in tropical diseases in Liverpool, the Nyasaland government terminated his stipend. He was forced to leave Liverpool when he refused on conscientious grounds to be conscripted as an Army doctor. He also became an elder of a parish in the Church of Scotland.

Between 1941 and 1945, he worked as a doctor in North Shields, near Newcastle upon Tyne. He was a tenant of Mrs Amy Walton at this time in Alma Place in North Shields and sent a Christmas card to her every year right up until her death in the late-1960s. In 1944, he met Merene French, the daughter-in-law of one of his patients, and began a relationship with her.

After World War II, he established a practice at the London suburb of Kilburn and became politically active by joining the Labour Party and Fabian Colonial Bureau, which was founded in 1940. Banda moved to London in 1945, buying a practice in the North London suburb of Harlesden. 

In 1945, at the behest of Chief Mwase of Kasungu, whom he had met in England in 1939, and other politically active Malawians, he represented the Nyasaland African Congress at the Fifth Pan-African Congress in Manchester. This conference was attended by other future African leaders, Jomo Kenyatta and Kwame Nkrumah. With help from sympathetic Britons, he also lobbied in London on behalf of the Congress.

===Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and move to Ghana===

Banda was actively opposed to the efforts of Sir Roy Welensky, a politician in Northern Rhodesia, to form a federation between Southern and Northern Rhodesia with Nyasaland, a move which he feared would result in further deprivation of rights for the Nyasaland blacks. The (as he called it) &quot;stupid&quot; federation was formed in 1953.

It was rumoured with some excitement that he would return to Nyasaland in 1951, but he moved instead to the Gold Coast in West Africa. He went there partly because of a scandal involving his receptionist in Harlesden, Merene French (Mrs French); despite reports that she became pregnant with his child, this has never been confirmed. Banda was cited as co-respondent in the divorce of Mr French and accused of adultery with Mrs French. She followed Banda to West Africa, but he wanted nothing more to do with her. She died in 1976.

===Call to return home===
Several influential Congress leaders, including Henry Chipembere, Kanyama Chiume, Dunduzu Chisiza and T.D.T. Banda (no relation) pleaded with him to return to Nyasaland to take up leadership of their cause. A delegation sent to the UK met with Banda at the Port of Liverpool, Liverpool, where he was making arrangements to return to Ghana. He agreed to return, but asked for some time to sort out a few private matters. The delegation returned without him and proceeded to make arrangements for his imminent return. After two false starts, including a fracas between the police and African crowds threatening to storm a BOAC aeroplane rumoured to be carrying Dr Banda at Chileka Airport, Banda finally made a showing on 6 July 1958 after an absence of about 42 years. In August, at Nkata Bay, he was acclaimed as the leader of the Congress.

==Return to Nyasaland==

He soon began touring the country, speaking against the Central African Federation (also known as the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland), and urging its citizens to become members of the party. Allegedly, he was so out of practice in his native Chichewa that he needed an interpreter, a role which was apparently performed by John Msonthi and later by John Tembo, who remained close to him for most of his career). He was received enthusiastically wherever he spoke, and resistance to imperialism among the Malawians became increasingly common. By February 1959, the situation had become serious enough that Rhodesian troops were flown in to help keep order, and a state of emergency was declared. On 3 March, Banda, along with hundreds of other Africans, was arrested in the course of &quot;Operation Sunrise&quot;. He was imprisoned in Gwelo (now Gweru) in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), and leadership of the Malawi Congress Party (the Nyasaland African Congress under a new name) was temporarily assumed by Orton Chirwa, who was released from prison in August 1959.

===Release from prison and path to independence===

The mood in Britain, meanwhile, had long been moving towards decolonisation due to pressure from its colonies. Banda was released from prison in April 1960 and was almost immediately invited to London for talks aimed at bringing about independence. Elections were held in August 1961. While Banda was technically nominated as Minister of Land, Natural Resources and Local Government, he became de facto Prime Minister of Nyasaland – a title granted to him formally on 1 February 1963. He and his fellow MCP ministers quickly expanded secondary education, reformed the so-called Native Courts, ended certain colonial agricultural tariffs and made other reforms. In December 1962, R. A. Butler, British Secretary of State for African Affairs, essentially agreed to end the Federation.

It was Banda himself who chose the name &quot;Malawi&quot; for the former Nyasaland; he had seen it on an old French map as the name of a &quot;Lake Maravi&quot; in the land of the Bororos, and liked the sound and appearance of the word as &quot;Malawi&quot;. On 6 July 1964, exactly six years after Banda&#x27;s return to the country, Nyasaland gained independence and renamed itself Malawi.

==Leader of Malawi==

===1964 cabinet crisis===

Barely a month after independence, Malawi suffered the Cabinet Crisis of 1964. Banda had already been accused of autocratic tendencies. Several of Banda&#x27;s ministers presented him with proposals designed to limit his powers. Banda responded by dismissing four of the ministers. Other ministers resigned in sympathy. The dissidents fled the country.

===New constitution and consolidation of power===

Malawi adopted a new constitution on 6 July 1966, in which the country was declared a republic. Banda was elected the country&#x27;s first president for a five-year term; he was the only candidate. The new document granted Banda wide executive and legislative powers, and also formally made the MCP the only legal party. However, the country had already been a de facto one-party state since independence. The new constitution effectively turned Banda&#x27;s presidency into a legal dictatorship.

In 1970, a congress of the MCP declared Banda its president for life. In 1971, the legislature declared Banda President for Life of Malawi as well. For the next quarter century, his full title was &quot;His Excellency the Life President of the Republic of Malawi, Ngwazi Dr. H. Kamazu Banda.&quot; The title &quot;ngwazi&quot; means &quot;saviour&quot; or &quot;conqueror&quot; in Chichewa.

Banda was mostly viewed externally as a benign, albeit eccentric, leader, an image fostered by his English-style three-piece suits, matching handkerchiefs, walking stick and fly-whisk. In June 1967, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Massachusetts with the encomium &quot; ... pediatrician to his infant nation&quot;. However, this image masked a regime that was rigidly authoritarian even by African standards of the time. While the constitution nominally guaranteed all manner of civil liberties, his government paid little attention to them in practice. Banda himself bluntly summed up his approach to ruling the country by saying, &quot;Everything is my business. Everything. Anything I say is law...literally law.&quot; Within Malawi, views on him ranged from cult-like devotion to fear.

=== The Mwanza Four incident ===

In 1983, three ministers – Dick Matenje, Twaibu Sangala, Aaron Gadama – and Member of Parliament David Chiwanga died in what was labelled officially as a &quot;traffic accident&quot;. Banda had invited an &quot;internal debate on pending multiparty democracy&quot; in Malawi. During a cabinet meeting, the three ministers had voiced support for the multiparty idea, effectively challenging Banda&#x27;s claim to life presidency. Angered, Banda promptly &quot;dissolved cabinet&quot; and announced that parliament would meet immediately. At the end of that sitting of parliament, everyone in the chambers was effectively stripped of their political status. The three men were then rounded up at the Zomba Parliament buildings for questioning. Chiwanga happened to walk in on them being tortured in a back room and had to be silenced too. The four were later bundled into Matenje&#x27;s Peugeot 604 and driven to Thambani in Mwanza District, west of Blantyre, where the accident was staged: sources reported that their car had &quot;overturned while the men had been attempting to escape into neighbouring Mozambique&quot;. Later, it was found out they had been killed by having tent pins hammered into their heads. Banda ordered a night burial and mandated that the caskets not be opened for a last viewing.

===Foreign policy===

====Anti-communism====

During Banda&#x27;s presidency, Malawi initially refused to establish diplomatic relations with any of the communist governments of Eastern Europe or Asia (however, relations were later established with Kim Il Sung&#x27;s North Korea in 1982 and with Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s Romania and Enver Hoxha&#x27;s Albania in 1985).

Banda was one of the few African leaders to support the United States in the Vietnam War, a position he adopted in part due to his hatred of communism.

====Relations with African countries====

While many southern African nations traded with apartheid-era South Africa out of economic necessity, Malawi was the only African nation that recognised South Africa and established diplomatic relations with it, including a trade treaty which angered other African leaders. They threatened to expel Malawi from the Organization of African Unity until Banda left power. Banda responded by accusing other African countries of hypocrisy, saying in a public speech to his parliament: &quot;There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats&quot; (&quot;Julius Caesar&quot;). He told them to concentrate on convincing the South African government that apartheid was unnecessary. Furthermore, he added that &quot;[African leaders] practice disunity, not unity, while posing as the liberators of Africa. While they play in the orchestra of Pan Africanism, their own Romes are burning&quot;.

====Relations with South Africa====

Banda was the only African ruler to establish diplomatic ties with South Africa during apartheid as well as the Portuguese regime in Mozambique. After the cabinet crisis in 1964, Banda became increasingly isolated in African politics. On the other hand, his antipathy for Roy Welensky and what he denounced as the &quot;stupid federation&quot; was a smokescreen he used to reject the proposed Bangula Hydro-electric dam – proposed to be bigger than the Gezira Dam in Khartoum – that Welensky&#x27;s Federation had sought and obtained funding for from the British government. Banda went on to blame everything including snails (likely to cause widespread Bilharzia) to abort the project. In turn, the British denied Banda the funding and budgetary support he needed to build his pet dream of a new capital city at Lilongwe, in his home region. Hence he turned to South Africa – itself playing geo-political games in the region – which gave him a soft loan of 300 million Rand. The &quot;quid pro quo&quot; was that Banda had to support South Africa&#x27;s apartheid policies among fellow African leaders. Hence, on one occasion he paid a state visit to South Africa where he met his South African counterparts at Stellenbosch. Banda once noted that, &quot;It is only contact like this [between South Africa and Malawi] that can reveal to your people that there are civilized people other than white...&quot; Banda&#x27;s staunch anticommunism also influenced his decision to seek warm relations with South Africa.

After the apartheid era ended and the ANC came to dominate South African politics during the 1990s, relations between Malawi and South Africa threatened to take a downward turn, but a Malawian task force spearheaded by Malawian diplomatic envoys to South Africa including SP Kachipande, and representatives in Malawi, including former diplomat, Mr. Phiri, arranged for a meeting between the two governments which resulted in Nelson Mandela&#x27;s first official visit to Malawi as president of the ANC in the early 1990s. He met with John Tembo and the president. The relations between the two governments continued to be cordial after it was revealed that Banda was secretly helping the ANC during the apartheid era. The Malawi government and South African government continued diplomatic relations.

====Involvement in Mozambique====

Banda&#x27;s involvement in Mozambique dated back to Portuguese colonial days in Mozambique when Banda supported the Portuguese colonial government and guerrilla forces that worked for it. Following independence in Malawi, Banda strengthened his relationship with the Portuguese colonial government by appointing Jorge Jardim as Malawi&#x27;s Honorary Consul in Mozambique in September 1964. He also worked against Liberation Front of Mozambique (FRELIMO) forces in Malawi in continued support of the Portuguese colonial forces. The Organization of African Unity had designated Malawi as one of the Frontline States to help independence movements in Mozambique.

By the 1980s, Banda supported both the government and the guerrilla movement during the Mozambique civil war. He successfully gave the Malawi Army and Malawi Young Pioneers opposing missions in Mozambique from 1987 to 1992. He had the Malawi Army support the Mozambican government, controlled by FRELIMO after the country&#x27;s independence in 1975, to defend Malawi&#x27;s interests in Mozambique. This was done formally through an agreement in 1984 with Samora Machel. Simultaneously, Banda used the MYP as couriers and active supporters of the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO), which had been fighting against Machel&#x27;s government since the late 1970s. Malawi was used to channel foreign aid from South Africa&#x27;s apartheid government. Machel issued a dossier to Frontline States with evidence that Banda was still supporting the insurgents in spite of the 1984 agreement to stop. By September 1986, Machel, Robert Mugabe, and Kenneth Kaunda visited Banda to persuade him to stop supporting RENAMO. Machel&#x27;s successor, Joaquim Chissano, continued to complain of Malawi&#x27;s lack of willingness to stop supporting RENAMO. Banda however was trying to keep Malawian interests in the Port of Nacala in Mozambique and did not want to rely on Tanzania and South Africa ports for its imports and exports due to the expense. Mozambique and Malawi came to an agreement to place troops from both countries in Nayuchi near the port. Incidents of Malawi Army members being killed over the course of four years angered the Army because MYP members were involved with the insurgents, essentially pitting the two against each other.

===Political demise===

The end of the Cold War sounded the death knell for Banda&#x27;s naked autocracy. Western leaders and international aid donors no longer had any use for Third World authoritarian anti-Communist regimes like Banda&#x27;s, all of which came under mounting pressure to democratize. Donors told Banda that he had to implement reforms aimed at making his government transparent and accountable to the people and the international community as a condition for further aid. The British government also stopped their financial support. In March 1992, Catholic bishops in Malawi issued a Lenten pastoral letter that criticized Banda and his government. Students of the University of Malawi at Chancellor College and the Polytechnic joined protests and demonstrations to support the bishops, forcing authorities to close the campuses.

In April 1992, Chakufwa Chihana, a labour unionist, openly called for a national referendum on the political future of Malawi. He was arrested before he finished his speech at Lilongwe International Airport. By October 1992, this mounting pressure from within and from the international community forced Banda to schedule a referendum on whether to maintain the one-party state. The referendum was held on 14 June 1993, resulting in an overwhelming vote (64 percent) in favour of multiparty democracy. After this, political parties besides the MCP were formed and preparation for the general elections began. Banda worked with the newly forming parties and the church, and made no protest when a special assembly stripped him of his title of President for Life, along with most of his powers. The transition from one of the most repressive regimes in Africa to democracy was fairly peaceful.

Operation Bwezani was a Malawi Army operation to disarm the Malawi Young Pioneers at the height of the political transition in December 1993. Bwezani means &quot;give back&quot;. The MYP had a strong network of spies and supporters countrywide at all levels in society. They were Banda&#x27;s personal security bodyguards and were all trained and indoctrinated in Kamuzuism and military training. The Malawi Army did not infiltrate this group before receiving encouragement by protests by the people.

After some questions about his health, Banda ran in Malawi&#x27;s first truly democratic presidential election in 1994. He was roundly defeated by Bakili Muluzi, a Yao from the southern region of the country. Banda quickly conceded defeat. ″I wish to congratulate him wholeheartedly and offer him [Muluzi] my full support and cooperation,″ he said on state radio, marking an end to Malawi&#x27;s 30 years of one-party rule.

The party Banda led since taking over from Orton Chirwa in 1960, the Malawi Congress Party, remains a major force in Malawian politics.

====Mwanza trials====

In 1995, Banda was arrested and charged with the murder, ten years previously, of former cabinet colleagues. He was acquitted due to lack of evidence.

Banda remained quite unrepentant in his opinion of Malawians, calling them &quot;children in politics&quot; and saying they would miss his iron-fisted rule.

A statement of apology was issued on 4 January 1996 in the name of H. Kamuzu Banda to the people of his nation shortly after being acquitted in the Mwanza Trials. The statement was met with controversy, suspicion and disdain. It was also questioned whether Banda wrote the statement himself or if someone wrote it on his behalf. In it, he noted that:

Systems of government are dynamic and they are bound to change in accordance with the wishes of and aspirations of the people...During my term of office, I selflessly dedicated myself to the good cause of Mother Malawi in the fight against Poverty, Ignorance and Disease among many other issues; but if within the process, those who worked in my government or through false pretence in my name or indeed unknowingly by me, pain and suffering was caused to anybody in this country in the name of nationhood, I offer my sincere apologies. I also appeal for a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness amongst us all...Our beautiful country has been nicknamed `The Warm Heart of Africa&#x27; and we have been admired for our warmth and spirit of hardwork. This admiration calls not only for a need for us to look at our past and present and draw lessons from it, but there is even a greater need for us to look forward to the future in our endeavours to reconstruct and reconcile if we have to move forward at all.
==Life in Banda&#x27;s Malawi==

===Party membership passcards===

All adult citizens were required to be members of the MCP. Party cards had to be carried at all times and presented at random police inspections. The cards were sold, often by Banda&#x27;s Malawi Young Pioneers (MYP). In some cases, these youths even sold cards for unborn children.

===Malawi Young Pioneers===

The Malawi Young Pioneers were the notorious paramilitary wing of the MCP, used to intimidate and harass the public. The Pioneers bore arms, conducted espionage and intelligence operations, and were trusted bodyguards for Banda. They helped foster the culture of fear that prevailed during his rule.

=== Cult of personality ===

Banda was the subject of an extensive cult of personality. Every business building was required to have an official picture of him hanging on the wall, and no poster, clock or picture could be higher than his portrait. Before every film, a video of Banda waving to the people was shown while the anthem played. When Banda visited a city, a contingent of women were expected to greet him at the airport and dance for him. A special cloth, bearing the president&#x27;s picture, was the required attire for these performances. Houses of worship required government approval to operate, and some faiths such as Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses were banned entirely.

===Censorship===

All films shown in cinemas were first viewed by the Malawi Censorship Board and edited for content. Nudity and other socially or politically unacceptable content were barred and movies could not even show couples kissing. Videotapes had to be sent to the Censorship Board to be viewed. Once edited, the film was given a sticker stating that it was now suitable for viewing and sent back to the owner. Items to be sold in bookshops were also edited. Pages, or parts of pages, were cut out of magazines like &quot;Newsweek&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;. Communist literature, erotic magazines, and Lonely Planet&#x27;s &quot;Africa on a Shoestring&quot; were banned. The mass media–a single radio station, a single daily newspaper, and a single weekly newspaperwere tightly controlled and mainly served as outlets for government propaganda, while the government refused to introduce television. However, wealthier Malawians bought sets as monitors for their VCRs. Knowledge of pre-Banda history was discouraged, and many books on these subjects were burned. Banda allegedly persecuted some of the northern tribes (particularly the Tumbuka), banning their language and books as well as teachers from certain tribes. Foreigners who broke any of these rules were often declared Prohibited Immigrants and deported.

===Dress code and conservatism===

His government supervised the people&#x27;s lives very closely. Early in his rule, Banda instituted a dress code rooted in his socially conservative predilections. Women were not allowed to wear see-through clothing, to have visible cleavages, trousers, and were not allowed to wear skirts or dresses that went above the knees. The only exception to this was at vacation resorts and country clubs, where they could not be seen by the general public. Banda explained that these restrictions were not designed to oppress women, but instill respect and dignity for them. Men&#x27;s hair had to be no longer than collar length, and foreign visitors at the airport were given mandatory haircuts if necessary. Any man who ventured into public with long hair could also be seized by police and subjected to an involuntary haircut.

Even foreigners coming into Malawi were subject to Banda&#x27;s dress code. In the 1970s, prospective visitors to the country were informed of the following requirement for obtaining visas:
Female passengers will not be permitted to enter the country if wearing short dresses or trouser-suits, except in transit or at Lake Holiday resorts or National parks. Skirts and dresses must cover the knees to conform with Government regulations. The entry of &#x27;hippies&#x27; and men with long hair and flared trousers is forbidden.
===Women&#x27;s issues===

Banda founded Chitukuko Cha Amai m&#x27;Malawi (CCAM) to address the concerns, needs, rights and opportunities for women in Malawi. This institution motivated women to excel in education and government and encouraged them to play more active roles in their community, church and family. The foundation&#x27;s National Advisor was Cecilia Tamanda Kadzamira, the official hostess for the former president.

===Infrastructure===
In 1964, after serving as a government minister in the colonial administration, Banda adopted a macroeconomic policy aimed at accelerating economic development for the betterment of Malawians. He settled on the Rostow model of &quot;catch up&quot; economics, wherein Malawi would vigorously pursue import substitution industrialisation (ISI). This entailed both a quest for &quot;self-sufficiency&quot; for Malawi – becoming less reliant on its former colonial master – and growth of an industrial base that could ensure Malawi was capable of producing its own goods and services. Such capacity would then be used to catch up and even overtake the West. An infrastructure development program was initiated under the Development Policies (DEVPOLs) documents that Malawi adopted from 1964 onwards. Much of this development was funded through the Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation, a Government-owned corporation or parastatal formed to promote the Malawian economy by increasing the volume of agricultural exports and to develop new foreign markets for Malawian agricultural produce. At its foundation, ADMARC was given the power to finance the economic development of any public or private organisation. From its formation it was involved in the diversion of resources from smallholder farming to tobacco estates, often owned by members of the ruling elite. This led to corruption, abuse of office and inefficiency in ADMARC,

The country&#x27;s infrastructure benefited through massive road construction programs. With the decision to shift the capital city from Zomba to Lilongwe (against vociferous objections from the British preference for the economically healthy and well-developed Blantyre), a new road was built linking Blantyre and Zomba to Lilongwe. The Capital City Development Corporation (CCDC) in Lilongwe was itself a beehive of infrastructure development, supported by planning and funds from apartheid-era South Africa. The British refused to finance the move to Lilongwe. The CCDC became the sole development agent for Lilongwe; putting up roads, the government seat at Capital Hill, etc. Other infrastructure entities were added, such as Malawi Hotels Limited, which undertook massive projects such as the Mount Soche, Capital Hotel and Mzuzu Hotel. On the industrial side, Malawi Development Corporation (MDC) was tasked with setting up industries and other businesses. Meanwhile, Dr. Banda&#x27;s own Press Corporation Limited and MYP&#x27;s Spearhead Corporation embarked on business initiatives that lead to an economic boom during the mid- to late 1970s.

However, by 1979–1980, the bubble had burst due to the global economic crisis set in motion by the Yom Kippur War between Israel and the Arabs in 1973. Rising oil prices and falling global commodity prices combined to wreak havoc on a fragile and landlocked Malawian economy based on an insular and indefensible ISI macroeconomic strategy. Increasingly, the economy was rearranged into a political tool to serve the consumption needs of the emerging Malawian middle-class and thus render it less prone to revolution.

Banda personally founded Kamuzu Academy, a school modeled on Eton, at which Malawian children were taught Latin and Greek by expatriate classics teachers, and disciplined if they were caught speaking Chichewa. Many of the school&#x27;s alumni have assumed leadership roles in medicine, academia and business in Malawi and abroad. The school remains one of Banda&#x27;s most lasting legacies and he said of it: &quot;I did not wish my sons and daughters to have to travel abroad to obtain an education as I did.&quot; It is claimed, probably incorrectly and unfairly, that he spent almost all the country&#x27;s education budget on this project, while increasingly ignoring the needs and welfare of the greater majority [80%] of Malawians toiling in the rural areas. The National Rural Development Program and Rural Growth Centers were tentative and belated policies aimed at diverting rural populations from moving to the few urban areas which Banda&#x27;s ISI macroeconomic policies had created and were now being battered by the arrival of more and more rural people seeking better opportunities.

Eventually, with the collapse of the Cold War, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund arrived, imposing a series of Structural Adjustment Programs from 1987.

==Wealth==

It is believed that during his rule, Banda accumulated at least US$320 million in personal assets, thought to be invested in everything from agriculture to mining interests in South Africa.

==Personal life==

Banda had no known heirs but had a vast fortune that is run by his family. He was unmarried when he died. Cecilia Kadzamira was the official hostess or first lady of Malawi. She essentially ruled the country with her uncle, John Tembo, during Banda&#x27;s last years.

His affair and relationship with Merene French remains largely a mystery. He had rejected companionship and marriage and turned his back on the Englishwoman who extramaritally bore his son. In 2010, Jumani Johansson (1973–2019) claimed to be the son of the late president and was seeking DNA testing through the courts of Malawi. Grand niece Jane Dzanjalimodzi was the former executrix of his estate.

==Death==
Banda suffered from heart failure for several years. In 1997, he was admitted to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Blantyre before being transferred to South Africa, where he died on 25 November 1997. His funeral took place on 3 December, with several African heads of state in attendance.

<text>The Laccadive or Kannur Islands are one of the three island subgroups in the Union Territory of Lakshadweep, India. It is the central subgroup of the Lakshadweep, separated from the Amindivi Islands subgroup roughly by the 11th parallel north and from the atoll of Minicoy (Maliku)—far to the south—by the 9 Degree or Mamala Channel.

Formerly the Union Territory of Lakshadweep was known as Laccadive, Minicoy, and Amindivi Islands, a name that was changed to Lakshadweep by an act of Parliament in 1973.

The Laccadive subgroup had been known earlier as the &quot;Cannanore Islands&quot; after the coastal town of Kannur. The name originated in the fact that while the northern group of Amindivi had stopped in 1784 being a vassal state of the Kannur Kingdom (Arakkal) in exchange for fealty to Tippu Sultan&#x27;s Kingdom of Mysore, the southern group remained loyal to Kannur.

==Geography==
The Laccadive subgroup includes the island of Agatti, with Agatti Aerodrome, the only airport in Lakshadweep, as well as Bangaram Atoll which has a tourist resort in Bangaram, its largest island.

The Laccadive group forms two talukas or subdivisions: Androth, with a population of 15,048 and Kavaratti with 17,193. The islands of Agatti, Androth, Kavaratti and Kalpeni are inhabited. Islam is the main religion of the islanders.

The Laccadive Islands subgroup consists mostly of atolls with islands, as well as part of one submerged bank. The Amindivi and the Laccadive subgroups have a submarine connection between them through Pitti Bank, a largely sunken atoll.

==History==
In the same manner as the Amindivi Islands further north, the islands of the Laccadive subgroup were settled from ancient times by people of nearby Kerala to which were added later people of Arab descent. Vasco da Gama visited these islands around 1498. In the mid 16th century all the inhabited islands of the Lakshadweep put themselves under the rule of the Arakkal kingdom in order to obtain protection from the Portuguese.

In 1697, the notorious pirate Captain Kidd and his crew brought their ship, the &quot;Adventure Galley&quot;, to the Laccadive Islands. The undisciplined crew chopped up the local boats for firewood, and raped the local women. When the men retaliated by killing the ship&#x27;s cooper, the pirates attacked the village and beat up the people who lived there.

Almost 100 years later—in 1784—the Amindivi group of islands rejected the protection of Cannanore and became a vassal state of the Kingdom of Mysore. The southern group, however, remained loyal to the rule of Cannanore.

Following the defeat of Tipu Sultan and the 1792 treaty of Srirangapatam, the southern subgroup was permitted by the East India Company to remain under the rule of the Cannanore Kingdom in exchange for a yearly tribute of 15,000 Rs. Since the tributary payments were often in arrears, the islands were put under direct rule of the British Government, first between 1855 and 1860, and then finally were annexed in 1877 by virtue of the doctrine of lapse, becoming attached to the Malabar District.

<text>Project Coast was a top-secret chemical and biological weapons (CBW) program instituted by the apartheid-era government of South Africa in the 1980s. Project Coast was the successor to a limited postwar CBW program, which mainly produced the lethal agents CX powder and mustard gas, as well as non-lethal tear gas for riot control purposes. The program was headed by the cardiologist Wouter Basson, who was also the personal physician of South African Prime Minister P. W. Botha.

==History==
From 1975 onwards, the South African Defence Force (SADF) found itself embroiled in conventional battles in Angola as a result of the South African Border War. The perception that its enemies had access to battlefield chemical and biological weapons (CBW) led South Africa to begin expanding its program, initially as a defensive measure and by researching vaccines. As the years went on, research shifted to offensive uses. In 1981, President P. W. Botha ordered the SADF to develop CBW technology for use against South Africa&#x27;s enemies. In response, the head of the South African Medical Service division, which was responsible for defensive CBW capabilities, hired Wouter Basson, a cardiologist, to visit other countries and report back on their respective CBW capabilities. He returned with the recommendation that South Africa&#x27;s program be expanded. In 1983, Project Coast was formed, with Basson at its head. To hide the program and its procurement of CBW-related substances, Project Coast formed four front companies: Delta G Scientific Company, Roodeplaat Research Laboratories, Protechnik and Infladel. Ben Raubenheimer was appointed as CEO.

Project Coast created a progressively larger variety of lethal offensive CBW toxins and biotoxins, in addition to the defensive measures. Initially, they were intended for use by the military in combat as a last resort. To that end, they copied Soviet techniques and designed devices that looked like ordinary objects but could poison those targeted for assassination. Examples included umbrellas and walking sticks that fired pellets containing poison, syringes disguised as screwdrivers, and poisoned beer cans and envelopes. In the early 1990s, with the end of apartheid, South Africa&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction programs were stopped. Despite efforts to destroy equipment, stocks, and information from those programs, some still remain, leading to fears that they may find their way into the possession of terrorist networks.

In May 2002, Daan Goosen, the former head of South Africa&#x27;s biological weapons program, contacted the FBI and offered to exchange existing bacterial stocks from the program in return for US$5 million, together with immigration permits for him and 19 other associates and their family members. The offer was eventually refused, with the FBI claiming that the strains were obsolete and therefore no longer a threat.

==Unusual features==
The South African chemical weapons program investigated all the standard CBW agents such as irritant riot control agents, lethal nerve agents and anticholinergic deliriants, which have been researched by virtually all countries that have carried out CBW research. The South African program differed from the CBW programs of many countries in its focus on developing nonlethal agents to help suppress internal dissent. This led to the investigation of unusual nonlethal agents, including illicit recreational drugs such as phencyclidine, MDMA, methaqualone and cocaine, as well as medicinal drugs such as diazepam, midazolam, ketamine, suxamethonium and tubocurarine, as potential incapacitating agents. 

According to the testimony given by Wouter Basson to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, analogues of the compounds were prepared and studied. Both methaqualone and MDMA (along with the deliriant BZ) were manufactured in large quantities and successfully weaponized into a fine dust or aerosol form that could be released over a crowd as a potential riot control agent. It was later discovered that Basson was also selling large quantities of MDMA and methaqualone as tablets on the black market. The amount manufactured was far larger than what was sold, but the court accepted that at least some genuine weaponization and testing of the agents had been done. 

A black mamba and its extracted venom were also part of the research, as were &quot;E. coli&quot; O157:H7 bacteria genetically modified to express some of the toxins made by &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot; bacteria. A list of purchases at RRL and other documents include references to such things as the snake, biological agents such as anthrax, brucellosis, cholera and salmonella among others, and chemicals including aluminium phosphide, thallium acetate, sodium azide, sodium cyanide, mercury oxycyanide, cantharides, colchicine, powerful anticoagulants such as brodifacoum, phenylsilatranes, strychnine, paraquat, &quot;knockout drops&quot;, digoxin, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as aldicarb and paraoxon and other poisons. 

Other plans referenced in the UN report included crowd control with pheromones, and discussion of the development of several novel compounds, including a locally produced variant of BZ, novel derivatives of CR gas including &quot;a compound which had a pyridine moiety in place of one of the benzene rings...[and] caused severe blisters on the skin&quot;, a new, more potent analogue of methaqualone and a &quot;dimethylketone-amphetamine&quot; derivative of MDMA. Another unusual project attempted to develop a method of sterilising crowds using a known male sterilant, pyridine . That was to be sprayed onto the crowds from a gas cylinder pressurised with nitrogen gas since pyridine is highly flammable. A subsequent industrial accident caused the death of a gas company employee when the experimental contaminated medical oxygen cylinder had been returned to the gas supplier and filled with oxygen that exploded.

== Employment ==

In 1985, four SWAPO detainees held at Reconnaissance Regiment headquarters were allegedly given a sleeping drug in soft drinks, taken to Lanseria airport outside Johannesburg, and injected with three toxic substances supplied by Basson. Their bodies were thrown into the Atlantic Ocean.

The Civil Cooperation Bureau operative Petrus Jacobus Botes, who claimed to have also directed bureau operations in Mozambique and Swaziland, asserted that he was ordered in May 1989 to contaminate the water supply at Dobra, a refugee camp in Namibia, with cholera and yellow fever organisms. A South African Army doctor provided them to him. In late August 1989, he led an attempt to contaminate the water supply, but it failed because of the high chlorine content in the treated water at the camp.

== Component of genocide ==
Research on birth control methods to reduce the black birth rate was one such area. Goosen, the managing director of Roodeplaat Research Laboratories between 1983 and 1986, told Tom Mangold of the BBC that Project Coast had supported a project to develop a contraceptive that would have been applied clandestinely to blacks. Goosen reported that the project had developed a &#x27;vaccine&#x27; for males and females and that the researchers were still searching for a means by which it could be delivered to make black people sterile without them being made aware. Schalk van Rensburg stated that “fertility and fertility control studies comprised 18% of all projects”.

Testimony given at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission suggested that Project Coast researchers were also looking into putting birth control substances in water supplies. The project officer for Project Coast, Doctor Basson, was put on trial for 64 charges, all of which were committed while he held that position. Goosen testified that when asked what motivated him, Basson had replied that &quot;although we do not have any doubt that black people will take over the country one day, when my daughter asks me what I did to prevent this, at least my conscience will be clean&quot;.

Despite strong links to Israel and Libya, no country has been directly implicated for involvement in the project, however, the project would not have been able to develop without some form of international support. According to Miles Jackson, while the focus on Apartheid South Africa’s research into fertility is barely part of the ongoing discussion regarding Project Coast, what occurred could constitute conspiracy to commit genocide under international law.

<doc id="213572" wikidata="Q208718" url="?curid=213572" title="Port Sudan">
<text>Port Sudan (, Beja: ) is a port city on the Red Sea in eastern Sudan, and the capital of Red Sea State. Port Sudan is Sudan&#x27;s main seaport and the source of 90% of the country&#x27;s international trade. The population of Port Sudan was estimated in the 2008 Census of Sudan to be 394,561 people.

Port Sudan has historically been a center for commercial activity, particularly in the shipping industry. Due to the civil war in the country that started in 2023, the military government has largely relocated to Port Sudan as a result of intense fighting in the capital city Khartoum, leading to it being described as a &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the country. Port Sudan also has emerged as a refuge for internally displaced persons in Sudan.

== History ==
=== Founding and early history ===
Port Sudan was built between 1905 and 1909 by the administration of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan to replace Suakin—the historic, coral-choked Arab port. An oil pipeline was built between the port and Khartoum in 1977.

=== Early 21st century ===

In 2009, Israel allegedly used naval commandos to attack Iranian arms ships at Port Sudan as part of Operation Birds of Prey. In 2020, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced that the Russian Navy would begin construction on a base with capacity for 300 personnel and four warships in Port Sudan. The facility would provide Russia with a naval base in the nation for at least 25 years. The plan was ultimately suspended, though Sudanese leadership has indicated that it is possible for the construction to go ahead in the future.

In 2016, it was reported that residents of Port Sudan face water scarcity. Following the October–November 2021 Sudanese coup d&#x27;état, the Beja tribal council initiated a weeklong blockade of the city&#x27;s ports. Following negotiations with military officials, the blockade was lifted. 

=== Sudanese civil war (2023–present) ===
During the Sudanese civil war (2023–present), Port Sudan has emerged as a leading destination and refuge for internally displaced persons fleeing war in other parts of the country. Internally-displaced refugees in the city reportedly face extreme heat and shortages of food and water.

By late October 2023, Reuters reported that the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) controlled most of Khartoum, causing the government led by Abdul Fattah el-Burhan to have largely relocated to Port Sudan. General Abdul Fattah al-Burhan, leader of the Sudanese Armed Forces, &quot;has threatened to establish a cabinet at the Red Sea city of Port Sudan, with the intention of creating an alternative or second capital.&quot; Hemedti, leader of the RSF, in turn, warned that this would lead to him declaring his own rival government based in Khartoum or another city he controlled. Analysts have raised concerns of a lasting split similar to that of Libya during its civil wars. Port Sudan has been described as becoming a &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Sudan.

On 11 January 2025, celebrations took place through the city after the Sudanese army recaptured Wad Madani.

== Economy==

The city has an oil refinery and handles 90% of the country&#x27;s international trade. Major exports include oilseed, senna, and hides and skins. Imports include construction materials, heavy machinery, and vehicles.

== Transport==
The city has a modern container port to handle imports and exports. The port is part of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean, there to the Upper Adriatic region of Trieste with its rail connections to Central and Eastern Europe.

The main airport is Port Sudan New International Airport. There is now a tarred road linking Port Sudan to Khartoum via Atbara. Port Sudan also has a 1067mm gauge rail link with Khartoum. There is also an international ferry from Jeddah.

In 2023 a new seaport was proposed about 200km north of Port Sudan at Abu Amama. A 450km road to the farming hub at Abu Hamad would also be provided. This new seaport is opposite Jeddah which shortens the ferry trip from Jeddah.

==Education==
The city is home to the Red Sea University, established in 1994.

== Places of worship ==

Places of worship are predominantly Muslim mosques, but there are also Christian churches and temples including the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Khartoum (Catholic Church), Sudan Interior Church (Baptist World Alliance), and Presbyterian Church in Sudan (World Communion of Reformed Churches) and Coptic Orthodox Churches.

==Climate==
Port Sudan has a hot desert climate (Köppen: BWh) with extremely hot summers and moderately hot winters, requiring the acquisition of fresh water from Wadi Arba&#x27;at in the Red Sea Hills and from salt-evaporating pans. Temperatures can easily exceed in winter and in summer. Over 90% of the annual rainfall falls between October and January, mostly in November, with the wettest month on record being November 1947 with , whilst the wettest year was from July 1923 to June 1924 with . Average annual rainfall is , and no rainfall occurred between January 1983 and June 1984. The mean temperature year round (the average of all daily highs and nighttime lows) is .

<text>The Treaty of Dover, also known as the Secret Treaty of Dover, was an agreement between Louis XIV of France and Charles II of England signed at Dover on 1 June 1670. Officially, it only committed England to provide France with general diplomatic assistance. However, of greater significance were secret provisions which remained largely unknown until published by historians over a century later. 

Under these, Charles would provide military backing for a French invasion of the Dutch Republic, and committed to convert to Catholicism at some future date. In return, Louis agreed to pay him a secret pension of £230,000 per year, as well as a bonus when his conversion was made public. Charles hoped these payments would help make him financially independent of Parliament. 

Although the conversion clause was never activated, the treaty led to the 1672 to 1674 Third Anglo-Dutch War, a related conflict of the 1672 to 1678 Franco-Dutch War.

==Background==

A possible Anglo-French treaty had been discussed after the 1660 Stuart Restoration, but none was agreed. Despite growing tensions over French ambitions in the Spanish Netherlands, Louis XIV of France decided an agreement with the Dutch Republic might allow him to achieve these without war. A Franco-Dutch defensive treaty was signed in 1662, while in January 1666 France entered the Second Anglo-Dutch War against England.

France took a minor role in the war, as mutual suspicion grew between the Dutch and Louis. Following the peace Treaty of Breda (1667), Louis invaded the Spanish Netherlands later that year, beginning the War of Devolution. To oppose French expansion in the region, a Triple Alliance was formed between the Dutch Republic, England and Sweden during 1668, which immediately pressured Louis into signing a peace treaty with Spain. During 1669, friction among the members of the Triple Alliance convinced Louis that he could induce either England or the Dutch Republic to leave it. Following an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate with the Dutch, Louis was approached by Charles with the offer of an alliance, which was delivered secretly by Charles&#x27; sister. At this stage, the only participants in the talks were Louis XIV of France, Charles II of England, and Charles&#x27;s sister Henrietta, &quot;duchesse d&#x27;Orléans&quot;. Louis was first cousin to Charles (through their grandfather Henry IV of France); Henrietta was also Louis&#x27;s sister-in-law through her marriage to his only brother, Phillippe, &quot;duc d&#x27;Orléans&quot;.

Charles&#x27;s motives for secretly entering into negotiations with France, while England was still part of the Triple Alliance against France, have been debated among historians. Suggested motives include: a desire to gain the alliance of Europe&#x27;s strongest state; to ensure Charles&#x27; political and financial independence from the English parliament; to put England in a position to receive a share of the Spanish Empire if it broke up (the infant Charles II of Spain had no clear heir); to gain the support of English Catholics (and possibly also Protestant dissenters) for the monarchy; or to seek revenge on the Dutch for the English defeat in the Second Anglo-Dutch War, particularly the humiliating Raid on the Medway. Charles initially attempted to form an alliance with France in 1668, without abandoning the Triple Alliance, so was not as consistent as Louis in opposing the Dutch. Louis was married to Maria Theresa, the eldest daughter of Philip IV of Spain (died 1665); Maria Theresa had renounced her inheritance rights, but Louis consistently manoeuvred to acquire Spanish territory adjacent to France and to promote his wife&#x27;s potential claim to the Spanish throne. Louis rebuffed Charles&#x27;s approach in 1668, as Charles was not willing to join a French attack on Spain.

In the early part of 1669, Louis attempted to gain Dutch agreement to his acquiring all or most of the Spanish Netherlands, but the Dutch themselves were anxious to prevent a French army being stationed on or near their frontiers. During the same period, Charles attempted to preserve the Triple Alliance by settling outstanding overseas trade issues with the Dutch, with little success. Through his ambassador Lord St Albans, Charles attempted simultaneously to restart negotiations for a French alliance, but Louis repeated the condition that England must join him in attacking the Netherlands. Charles remained unenthusiastic, but his failure to gain the security he sought by other diplomatic means forced him to accept this precondition, subject to substantial French financial assistance. The parties entered into more detailed discussions by December 1669. During the five months in which detailed terms were being agreed, both parties attempted to reach understandings with Spain: their realisation that Spain might cede the Spanish Netherlands to France in a territorial exchange or act in concert with the Triple Alliance was a strong incentive for Charles and Louis respectively to reach a final agreement.

By the secret treaty, Charles was to abandon the Triple Alliance with Sweden and the Dutch Republic in favour of assisting Louis in conquering the Dutch Republic. Provided that the conquest was successfully completed, England was promised several very profitable ports along one of the major rivers that run through the Dutch Republic. The main components of the treaty can be paraphrased:

By Article 7 of the treaty, Charles was able to secure only a vague promise that the rights and interests of his nephew, William, Prince of Orange, would be respected.

The secret treaty did not become public until 1771 when the historian Sir John Dalrymple published its contents in his &quot;Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;. Had it been published in Charles II&#x27;s lifetime, the results might have been drastic; considering the enormous effect of Titus Oates&#x27;s highly unreliable assertions of a Popish Plot, an even greater backlash might have followed had the English public learned that the King actually obliged himself to turn Catholic and that he was willing to rely on French troops to impose that conversion on his own subjects.

==The &quot;cover&quot; treaty==
The secret treaty was signed and sealed in June 1670. The Duke of Buckingham was then appointed to negotiate a treaty with the King of France. He was amazed by how smoothly it went. This treaty closely followed the secret treaty just concluded, but the clause by which King Charles was to declare himself a Roman Catholic as soon as the affairs of his kingdom permitted did not appear; neither, therefore, did the stipulation that the attack on the Netherlands would follow his declaration. This treaty was signed by all five members of the Cabal Ministry on 21 December 1670 and was made known to the public. However King Charles and the French knew it was a meaningless fake.

== Consequences ==

Military preparations took some time; Louis declared war on the Dutch on 6 April 1672, and Charles followed suit the next day. On 14 April 1672 under the Treaty of Stockholm, France paid Sweden subsidies to remain neutral, while also promising Sweden military support if it were threatened by Brandenburg-Prussia. This Franco-Swedish alliance completed Louis&#x27; diplomatic encirclement of the Republic.

The Third Anglo-Dutch War started badly for the Dutch. The French strategy was to invade the Dutch Republic along the line of the River Rhine where Dutch defences were weakest, outflanking the main defences on the Dutch border with the Spanish Netherlands. Despite warnings about French intentions, the Dutch leader Johan de Witt mistakenly thought that the war against France and England would be decided at sea, and he prioritised equipping the Dutch fleet while neglecting the eastern frontier fortresses. This led to significant early French successes and a near-collapse of the Dutch army, which was forced to retreat behind the inundations of The Dutch Water Line and offer peace terms that were very favourable to France. The year 1672 is known to the Dutch as the &quot;Rampjaar&quot; or &#x27;Year of disaster&#x27;: the Orangists blamed de Witt whom they forced to resign, and they later brutally killed him and his brother Cornelis.

The breathing space afforded by its retreat behind the inundations, followed by military reforms, recruitment of new troops and unofficial Spanish assistance, enabled the Dutch army, led by William III of Orange as its Captain-General, to hold the Dutch Water Line for the rest of 1672 and 1673. Louis was now involved in a war of attrition and faced growing opposition from other European powers. Charles was short of money, as the costs of deploying the English fleet were much greater than expected despite French subsidies, and he faced increasing domestic opposition to the war. Part of this opposition related to English perceptions that the French fleet had stood by while the English fleet bore the brunt of the fighting the Dutch.

In the Battle of Solebay in 1672, d&#x27;Estrées, commanding the French squadron, avoided the main battle and only engaged a much smaller Dutch force at long-range, earning the condemnation of English, and of some French officers. The conduct of the French fleet in the two 1673 Battles of the Schooneveld was undistinguished and, in the final 1673 conflict, the Battle of the Texel, D&#x27;Estrées, either through poor seamanship, or because he had been ordered by Louis XIV to preserve the French fleet should England make peace with the Dutch, failed to engage the Dutch closely. In addition, Dutch privateers had been much more successful at capturing English merchant ships than English privateers attacking Dutch vessels in this war.

Desperate for funds, Charles was forced to call Parliament into session for the first time in over two years. He had hoped to keep it prorogued in order to wage the war without its oversight. In 1674, largely because of the pressure put upon Charles by Parliament, England signed the Treaty of Westminster: this largely restored the pre-war status quo and ended the Third Anglo-Dutch War. The French would continue to fight for four more years. A peace conference was convened at Nijmegen in 1676, but this made little progress as the French insisted in retaining the Dutch fortress of Maastricht. However, the conclusion of an Anglo-Dutch defensive treaty in March 1678 convinced Louis to offer peace without the cession of any Dutch territory, leading to the signing of the Treaty of Nijmegen. Although not unfavourable to the Dutch, and less favourable to France than the terms offered by the Dutch in 1672, France gained Franche-Comté and several towns in the Spanish Netherlands by this treaty, although relinquishing other conquests. More importantly, Louis achieved a diplomatic victory by breaking the European alliance against him.

In 1672, Charles issued a Declaration of Indulgence which suspended the penal laws against nonconforming Protestants and also relaxed (but did not suspend) the penal laws applying to Roman Catholics. When Parliament reconvened that year, they denounced the Declaration and announced that the English monarch did not possess the power to issue proclamations that suspended penal laws passed by the Parliament. Furthermore, they refused to fund the ongoing Third Anglo-Dutch War until the declaration was withdrawn. Charles was forced to comply with Parliament&#x27;s demands, thereby ending the chance offered by the treaty of reconciling England with the Roman Catholic Church.

The treaty&#x27;s reference to the possibility of &quot;new rights to the Spanish monarchy reverting to the King of France&quot; envisaged the possibility of Charles II of Spain dying childless, and of Louis then claiming the Spanish throne for the House of Bourbon through his wife. At the time of the treaty, the Spanish monarch was only nine years old, but his infirmity was already evident and well-known, casting doubt on his ever being able to beget children. However, Charles&#x27;s promise to Louis was purely personal, and as the Spanish King outlived him, his promise had no effect. When, shortly after the conclusion of the Nine Years&#x27; War, the death of Charles II of Spain seemed imminent, the exhausted participants agreed by the First Partition Treaty of 1698, brokered by William III, that Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria would succeed to the Spanish throne, and that France and Austria would divide Spain&#x27;s European possessions outside the Iberian Peninsula. After Joseph Ferdinand&#x27;s death in 1699, the Second Partition Treaty of 1700, also sponsored by William III awarded Spain and its overseas possessions to Archduke Charles and most of Spain&#x27;s European possessions to France. However, when the Spanish king died childless in 1700, William III&#x27;s foreign policy initiative was nullified when Louis claimed the whole Spanish inheritance for his grandson, and French ambitions caused the War of Spanish Succession.

<doc id="213578" wikidata="Q348441" url="?curid=213578" title="John of Lancaster, Duke of Bedford">
<text>John of Lancaster, Duke of Bedford (20 June 1389 – 14 September 1435) was a medieval English prince, general, and statesman who commanded England&#x27;s armies in France during a critical phase of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Bedford was the third son of King Henry IV of England, brother to Henry V, and acted as regent of France for his nephew Henry VI. Despite his military and administrative talent, the situation in France had severely deteriorated (for the English) by the time of his death.

Bedford was a capable administrator and soldier, and his effective management of the war brought the English to the height of their power in France. However, difficulties mounted after the arrival of Joan of Arc, and his efforts were further thwarted by political divisions at home and the wavering of England&#x27;s key ally, Duke Philip of Burgundy and his faction, the Burgundians. In the last years of Bedford&#x27;s life, the conflict devolved into a war of attrition, and he became increasingly unable to gather the necessary funds to prosecute the conflict.

Bedford died during the congress of Arras in 1435, just as Burgundy was preparing to abandon the English cause and conclude a separate peace with Charles VII of France.

==Birth and family==
John of Lancaster was born on 20 June 1389, to Henry Bolingbroke (later Henry IV, King of England) and his wife, Mary de Bohun. He was a grandson of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, a son of King Edward III.

His father, Henry Bolingbroke, was exiled in 1399 by his cousin, Richard II, when his father participated in the revolt of the Lords Appellant in 1388, the year before his birth. Upon the death of John of Gaunt, Richard II did not allow Bolingbroke to inherit his father&#x27;s duchy of Lancaster. That year Bolingbroke, with help from the nobility, was able to gather supporters and deposed Richard II, who later died of starvation either by his own will or by force. Bolingbroke was crowned King of England, as Henry IV, on 13 October 1399.

John&#x27;s eldest sibling was Henry of Monmouth, later King of England as Henry V. John&#x27;s other siblings were Thomas of Lancaster, Duke of Clarence; Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester; Philippa; and Blanche.

== Acquisitions, knighted, and titles ==
After his father&#x27;s accession to the throne of England as Henry IV in 1399, John began to accumulate lands and lucrative offices. He was knighted on 12 October 1399 at his father&#x27;s coronation, and made a Knight of the Garter in 1400.

He was appointed master of the mews and falcons in 1402, Constable of England in 1403 and Warden of the East March from 1403 to 1414. He was created Earl of Kendal, Earl of Richmond and Duke of Bedford in 1414 by his brother, King Henry V.

==Warden of the East March==
John gained his early experiences in warfare when he undertook the office of warden of the east marches of Scotland in 1404; he was fairly successful in this command. By the middle of 1404, his pay was in arrear, his troops were mutinous, he was in a disaffected country, and was engaged in constant hostilities. With the little pay that was sent to him, John borrowed money from Lord Furnival and used revenues from a grant of castles belonging to Henry Percy to maintain his forces. 

In 1405, he wrote to inform the council of the revolt of Lord Bardolf, joined the Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, warden of the west marches, and met the Archbishop Richard Scrope and the other rebels on Shipton Moor. He received grants of the castles of the Earl of Northumberland. In April 1408, and again in April 1411, he was appointed to treat with the Scots. During the rest of his father&#x27;s reign, which ended in March 1413, he continued to hold his command in the north, fortifying Berwick and keeping peace as far as he was able in the east marches. Like his eldest brother, he seems to have been under the influence of the Beauforts, and acted cordially with the Earl of Westmoreland. He held the command until September 1414.

==Military campaigns==
In May 1413, his brother, now King Henry V, had created him Duke of Bedford, and after resigning the wardenship he began to take a leading part in the royal councils. He acted as lieutenant of the kingdom during Henry&#x27;s expedition to France in 1415. In August 1416, he commanded the ships which defeated the French fleet at the mouth of the Seine, and was instrumental in relieving Harfleur. Again appointed lieutenant in July 1417, he marched against the Scots, who abandoned the siege of Berwick at his approach; and on his return to London he brought Sir John Oldcastle to trial and was present at his execution. He appears to have governed the country with considerable success until December 1419, when he resigned his office as lieutenant and joined the king in France. Returning to England, he undertook the lieutenancy for the third time in June 1421, and in the following May conducted the queen to join Henry in Normandy. He then took his brother&#x27;s place and led the English troops to the relief of Cosne, but on hearing of the king&#x27;s serious illness he left the army and hurried to his side. 

===Regency===
Henry V&#x27;s last wish was that Bedford should be guardian of the kingdom and of the young king, and that Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, should act as regent in France. But when Philip declined to undertake this office, it too was assumed by Bedford, who, after the death of the French king Charles VI in October 1422, presided at a session of the Parlement of Paris, and compelled all present to take an oath of fidelity to King Henry VI of England. Meanwhile the English parliament had decided that Bedford should be Lord Protector of the kingdom, and that in his absence the office should devolve upon his brother Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester. Confining himself to the conduct of affairs in France the protector took up Henry V&#x27;s work of conquest, captured Meulan and other places, and sought to strengthen his position by an alliance with Philip of Burgundy. This task was rendered more difficult as Gloucester had just married Jacqueline, Countess of Holland and Hainaut, a union which gave the English duke a claim on lands which Philip hoped to secure for himself. Bedford, however, having allayed Philip&#x27;s irritation, formed an alliance with him and with John VI, Duke of Brittany, at Amiens in April 1423, and himself arranged to marry Anne of Burgundy, a sister of the Burgundian duke. 

===Campaigns in France===
Bedford sought to restore prosperity to the districts under his rule by reforming the debased coinage, granting privileges to merchants and manufacturers, and removing various abuses. He then granted some counties to Philip to check the growing hostility between him and Gloucester, and on 17 August 1424 gained a great victory over a combined army of French and Scots at the Battle of Verneuil. But in spite of the efforts of the protector the good understanding between England and Burgundy was partially destroyed when Gloucester invaded Hainaut in October 1424. The ambition of his brother gave Bedford trouble in another direction also; for on his return from Hainaut Gloucester quarrelled with the chancellor, Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester, and the council implored Bedford to come to England to settle this dispute. He reached London in January 1426, and after concluding a bond of alliance with Gloucester effected a reconciliation between the duke and the chancellor; and knighted the young king, Henry VI. 

Bedford then promised to act in accordance with the will of the council, and in harmony with the decision of this body raised a body of troops and returned to France in March 1427. Having ordered Gloucester to desist from a further attack on Hainaut, he threatened Brittany and compelled Duke John to return to the English alliance; and the success of his troops continued until the Siege of Orléans, to which he consented with reluctance, was undertaken in October 1428. Having assured himself that Philip was prepared to desert him, Bedford sent orders to his army to raise the siege in April 1429. He then acted with great energy and judgment in attempting to stem the tide of disasters which followed this failure, strengthened his hold upon Paris, and sent to England for reinforcements; but before any engagement took place he visited Rouen, where he sought to bind the Normans closer to England, and after his return to Paris resigned the French regency to Philip of Burgundy in accordance with the wish of the Parisians. 

Bedford had been Governor in Normandy between 1422 and 1432, where the University of Caen was founded under his auspices. He was an important commissioner of illuminated manuscripts, both from Paris (from the &quot;Bedford Master&quot; and his workshop) and England. The three most important surviving manuscripts of his are the Bedford Hours, the Salisbury Breviary, both made in Paris, and the Bedford Psalter and Hours of about 1420–23, which is English.

Retaining the government of Normandy, Bedford established himself at Rouen and directed the movements of the English forces with some success. He did not interfere to save the life of Joan of Arc. After Joan was captured by Burgundian troops at Compiegne and then transferred to the English, Bedford had her put on trial by clergy who are listed in English government records and described by eyewitnesses as pro-English collaborators. She was executed at Rouen on 30 May 1431.

He was joined by Henry VI in April 1430, when the regency was temporarily suspended, and he secured Henry&#x27;s coronation at Paris in December 1431.

His next act was to secure an inquiry into the national finances; and when asked by the parliament to stay in England he declared that his services were at the king&#x27;s disposal. As chief councillor he offered to take a smaller salary than had been previously paid to Gloucester, and undertook this office in December 1433, when his demands with regard to a continual council were conceded. Bedford, who was anxious to prosecute the war in France, left England again in 1434, but early in 1435 was obliged to consent to the attendance of English representatives at a congress held to arrange terms of peace at Arras. Unable to consent to the French terms the English envoys left Arras in September, and Philip of Burgundy made a separate treaty with France.

== Richard of Bedford ==
Richard of Bedford, the illegitimate son of John of Lancaster, Duke of Bedford, was generally known as Richard Bastard of Bedford, which was not uncommon for illegitimate sons of noblemen in France and Devonshire, England. Richard was likely conceived before John was married in 1423. Richard&#x27;s cousin, Henry VI of England, legitimised Richard on 30 August 1434 (which was recorded at the in Rouen, France on 27 September 1435). He was allowed to inherit property in England and France after he was legitimized.

Richard succeeded to the lordship of La Haye-du-Puits, France (merged into La Haye, Manche in 2016) and acquired the castle upon the death of his father in 1435. The bequest from his father was set aside.

==Marriages==
John&#x27;s first marriage was to Anne of Burgundy (d. 1432), daughter of John the Fearless, on 13 May 1423 in Troyes. The couple were happily married, despite being childless. Anne died of the plague in Paris in 1432.

Louis of Luxembourg, bishop of Thérouanne, arranged a marriage between his niece, Jacquetta of Luxembourg, daughter of Peter I, Count of Saint-Pol, and the regent. It was a strategic move as the House of Luxembourg was rich and powerful. The marriage was performed by the bishop at Therouanne on 20 April 1433. The new duchess was only seventeen. This marriage was also childless. Jacquetta went on to have more than a dozen children in her second marriage to Richard Woodville (later Earl Rivers). Her eldest child, Elizabeth Woodville, became queen consort of England as the spouse of Edward IV.

==Death==
John died in Rouen on 14 September 1435, and was buried in the choir of Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Rouen. By his will, made four days before his death, he left all his possessions to his wife except one castle, which was to go to his natural son Richard. His nephew, Henry VI, was to have all in remainder.

==In literature==
He appears in William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, and &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;, as John of Lancaster, and in &quot;Henry V&quot; and &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot;, as the Duke of Bedford. In the former play, he is portrayed as being present at the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403, when then aged 14, though no chroniclers of the time mention him.

Georgette Heyer&#x27;s novel &quot;My Lord John&quot; is the first part of a never-completed trilogy focused on him that deals with his life from when he was four to about twenty. Brenda Honeyman&#x27;s novel &quot;Brother Bedford&quot; covers his life from Henry V&#x27;s death to his own.

In the 2011 Philippa Gregory novel, &quot;The Lady of the Rivers&quot;, John features in a minor role as the first husband of its main character Jacquetta of Luxembourg.

==Arms==
As a son of the sovereign, John bore the royal arms of his father King Henry IV, differenced by a &quot;label of five points per pale ermine and France&quot;, which are published in the Bedford Book of Hours.

<doc id="213579" wikidata="Q1256112" url="?curid=213579" title="Dread Zeppelin">
<text>Dread Zeppelin was an American reggae rock band. Formed in 1989 in Sierra Madre, California, the band combined hard rock and reggae styles with humor. They are best known for performing the songs of Led Zeppelin in a reggae style as sung by a Las Vegas Elvis impersonator. They also performed songs originally by Elvis Presley, Bob Marley and The Yardbirds. The group toured extensively around the world during their tenure with I.R.S. Records.

==Career==
===1986–1989: The Prime Movers===
The nucleus of Dread Zeppelin, bassist Put-Mon (Gary Putman), drummer Cheese (Curt Lichter) and guitarist Jah Paul Jo (Joseph &quot;Severs&quot; Ramsey), were from a Pasadena, California group called The Prime Movers. Signed to Island Records in 1986, The Prime Movers had some success in the UK with singles &quot;On The Trail&quot; and &quot;Dark Western Night&quot;. The late Stuart Adamson of Big Country contributed his trademark E-Bow guitar to &quot;Dark Western Night&quot; and another Prime Mover song, &quot;Strong As I Am&quot;, was featured in Michael Mann&#x27;s motion picture thriller, &quot;Manhunter&quot;.

When The Prime Movers ended in 1989, Jah Paul Jo hatched the idea for a new group that would call itself &quot;Dread Zeppelin&quot;. Aside from the three original members, the band recruited guitarist Carl Jah (Carl Haasis) and 300-pound Vegas-era Elvis impersonator Tortelvis (Greg Tortell). The band supposedly met Tortelvis when he rammed his milk float into the back of the band&#x27;s car. Longtime graphic artist for The Prime Movers, Bryant Fernandez, was brought in as conga-man Ed Zeppelin.

The concept for Dread Zeppelin may be less bizarre than it seems. Notably, Led Zeppelin did make a recording which reflected a prominent reggae influence, the 1973 song &quot;D&#x27;yer Mak&#x27;er&quot;. Also, the band frequently performed Elvis Presley songs in concert, often presented as a medley which occasionally flirted with self-parody. (Led Zeppelin met Elvis briefly in 1974 after attending one of his concerts in Los Angeles.)

===1989: Birdcage Records===
The first Dread Zeppelin recording was meant to be a goof on Led Zeppelin&#x27;s 45 single &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; and its sought-after non-LP B-Side &quot;Hey Hey What Can I Do&quot;. Produced by Jah Paul Jo and Rasta Li-Mon (Lee Manning) and released on their indie Birdcage Records label, the single sold amazingly well and represses featured the seven inch 45 RPM in a rasta rainbow of colors: red (original), green, yellow, blue, white and clear vinyl. All early Dread Zeppelin recordings and most of the band&#x27;s first album &quot;Un-Led-Ed&quot; were recorded at the home studio of Dave Stewart of Eurythmics, where Rasta Li-Mon was a house engineer.
After the success of &quot;Immigrant Song&quot;, a second single, &quot;Whole Lotta Love/Tour-telvis: A Bad Trip&quot;, was released on Birdcage Records. A third, &quot;Your Time is Gonna Come/Woodstock (live)&quot;, was released not as a single but as part of a singles compilation entitled &quot;Komm Gib Mir Deine Zeppelin&quot; (a play on the title of the German version of The Beatles&#x27; song &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;). There was also a live cassette issued by Birdcage, but only to members of The Dread Zeppelin fan club, called &quot;Live On Blueberry Cheesecake.&quot;

===1990: I.R.S. years===
In 1990, Dread Zeppelin were signed to Miles Copeland III&#x27;s IRS label. Their first album, &quot;Un-Led-Ed&quot;, consisted of more covers taken from &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot; and &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot;, plus &quot;Black Dog&quot; from Led Zeppelin&#x27;s untitled fourth album. Original drummer Cheese (Curt Lichter) left the band just after recording &quot;Un-Led-Ed&quot;. He was replaced by Fresh Cheese (Paul Maselli). Shortly before &quot;Un-Led-Ed&quot; was released, the original Ed Zeppelin (percussion and Reggae Dub) was replaced by his identical twin brother who was the former lead singer of local LA bands: Rampage, Blue Frontier and Public Eye.

&quot;Un-Led-Ed&quot; was successful. In autumn 1990, Dread Zeppelin took a three-week break from touring and recorded their second album, &quot;5,000,000* *Tortelvis Fans Can&#x27;t Be Wrong&quot;. In addition to the usual &quot;Zeppelin in a reggae style&quot;, this album also featured a cover of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;Stir It Up&quot; as well as three original songs.

For the next album, the band had planned a rock opera, &quot;Albert&quot;, about a rock critic who wanted to be a star (based loosely on the real rock critic Albert Goldman), but this never materialized. The plan changed to an album of disco covers, &quot;It&#x27;s Not Unusual&quot;. Both Ed Zeppelin and Fresh Cheese had left the band after &quot;5,000,000* *Tortelvis Fans Can&#x27;t Be Wrong&quot;, and during rehearsals for the new album, Tortelvis also quit. Bassist Put-Mon (Gary Putman) took over the vocals, assuming the name Gary B.I.B.B. &quot;It&#x27;s Not Unusual&quot; featured guest spots by both Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins and Randy Bachman.

Whether it was the public&#x27;s resistance to disco, or the lack of Dread&#x27;s popular frontman, Tortelvis, sales of &quot;It&#x27;s Not Unusual&quot; were disappointing. The band was dropped by IRS and for all intents and purposes, had dissolved.

===1993: &quot;Hot &amp; Spicy Beanburger&quot;===

Unknown to the band, Dread Zeppelin were being sought by Australian rock band INXS to be the support band on their US tour. INXS were fans of Dread Zeppelin. Tortelvis was persuaded to return to the band; however, without a recording contract, he could only perform at the May 8, 1993, show at . Dread Zeppelin returned to the studio. With Jah Paul Jo and Rasta Li-Mon again producing, they recorded &quot;Hot &amp; Spicy Beanburger&quot;, a 1993 release on Birdcage Records.

In the spring of 1994, Dread Zeppelin appeared in the feature film &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Last Resort&quot; and provided a song for the closing credits. Carl Jah (Carl Haasis) and Ed Zeppelin left the band shortly thereafter.

With Put-Mon moving from bass to lead guitar and the addition of David Raven (drums), bassist Derf Nosna Haj (Freddie Johnson) and Fernandez (Pete Burke) on conga and toast, Dread Zeppelin recorded &quot;No Quarter Pounder&quot;. Released by Birdcage Records in 1995, &quot;No Quarter Pounder&quot; would be the band&#x27;s final Birdcage CD as Jah Paul Jo left the group shortly after its release.

===1996: Imago===
The remaining members of Dread Zeppelin signed onto Imago Records and released &quot;The Fun Sessions&quot;, a collection of classic rock covers. It was the first all non-Led Zeppelin cover recording with the exception of &quot;BBWAGS (Butt-Boy&#x27;s Wearin&#x27; a Girls&#x27; Shirt)&quot; written by Gary Putman. This would be Derf Nosna Haj (Freddie Johnson) and Fernandez (Pete Burke) last recording with the band. After the Imago release, Carl Jah and Ed Zeppelin returned to the band.

===1999: Cleopatra===
The band then signed to Cleopatra Records and recorded &quot;De-jah Voodoo&quot; in 1999. The recording was produced by bassist Bob Knarley (Howard Ulyate) and includes 11 Led Zeppelin covers and two tracks written by the band (Putman, Ulyate, Fernandez, Tortell, and Boerin).

&quot;De-jah Voodoo&quot; was later re-released with a new cover and title (&quot;Re-Led-Ed&quot;); some versions include an acoustic version of &quot;Hey Hey What Can I Do&quot; as a bonus track.

===2000–2011: Cash Cow===
In 1995 Dread Zeppelin had a new production company, Cash Cow, run by original members Gary Putman (Butt-Boy) and Greg Tortell (Tortelvis), which had produced the &quot;Fun Sessions&quot;. They released the live album &quot;Front Yard Bar*B*Que&quot; in December 1996 and the all-original album &quot;Spam Bake&quot; (a take-off of the Elvis movie sound recordings of the 1960s) in November 1997.

Also released on Cash Cow Records were the band&#x27;s first full length Christmas recording &quot;Presents&quot; in 2002, followed by &quot;Chicken and Ribs&quot; 2004; both were produced by Bob Knarley. In February 2008 the band released &quot;Bar Coda&quot;, produced by Spice (Cris Boerin). Other Cash Cow releases included the DVDs &quot;Jah-La-Palooza 2004&quot; and &quot;Live in Minne-Jah-Polis 2002&quot;. The album &quot;SoSo&quot; (the title referencing Led Zeppelin&#x27;s fourth album), followed in 2011, produced by Spice.

Lead singer Tortelvis sang &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at Bank One Ballpark, now known as Chase Field, in Phoenix, Arizona on May 27, 2005. He had been scheduled to sing the song at a Minnesota Twins game in 1990, but Roseanne Barr&#x27;s notorious version quashed that opportunity.

===2012-2016===
Carl Jah released a solo album in 2012; in 2014, founding guitarist Jah Paul Jo died following years of poor health. Dread Zeppelin toured regularly through 2014; Putman is the only member of Dread Zeppelin to have performed on every record and played every live show to date.

They last performed live on April 2, 2016.

<text>A prime reciprocal magic square is a magic square using the decimal digits of the reciprocal of a prime number.

== Formulation == 
=== Basics ===
In decimal, unit fractions formula_1 and formula_2 have no repeating decimal, while formula_3 repeats formula_4 indefinitely. The remainder of formula_5, on the other hand, repeats over six digits as,
formula_6

Consequently, multiples of one-seventh exhibit cyclic permutations of these six digits:

formula_7

If the digits are laid out as a square, each row and column sums to formula_8 This yields the smallest base-10 non-normal, prime reciprocal magic square

In contrast with its rows and columns, the &quot;diagonals&quot; of this square do not sum to 27; however, their mean is 27, as one diagonal adds to 23 while the other adds to 31.

All prime reciprocals in any base with a formula_9 period will generate magic squares where all rows and columns produce a magic constant, and only a select few will be full, such that their diagonals, rows and columns collectively yield equal sums.

=== Decimal expansions ===
In a full, or otherwise prime reciprocal magic square with formula_9 period, the even number of formula_11−th rows in the square are arranged by multiples of formula_12 — not necessarily successively — where a magic constant can be obtained.

For instance, an even repeating cycle from an odd, prime reciprocal of formula_13 that is divided into formula_14−digit strings creates pairs of complementary sequences of digits that yield strings of nines (9) when added together: 

formula_15

This is a result of Midy&#x27;s theorem. These complementary sequences are generated between multiples of prime reciprocals that add to 1. 

More specifically, a factor formula_14 in the numerator of the reciprocal of a prime number formula_13 will shift the decimal places of its decimal expansion accordingly,

formula_18

In this case, a factor of 2 moves the repeating decimal of formula_19 by eight places.

A uniform solution of a prime reciprocal magic square, whether full or not, will hold rows with successive multiples of formula_12. Other magic squares can be constructed whose rows do not represent consecutive multiples of formula_12, which nonetheless generate a magic sum.

== Magic constant ==
Magic squares based on reciprocals of primes formula_13 in bases formula_23 with periods formula_9 have magic sums equal to,

formula_25 

The table below lists some prime numbers that generate prime-reciprocal magic squares in given bases.

== Full magic squares ==
The formula_26 magic square with maximum period 18 contains a row-and-column total of 81, that is also obtained by both diagonals. This makes it the first full, non-normal base-10 prime reciprocal magic square whose multiples fit inside respective formula_11−th rows:

formula_28

The first few prime numbers in decimal whose reciprocals can be used to produce a non-normal, full prime reciprocal magic square of this type are 

:{19, 383, 32327, 34061, 45341, 61967, 65699, 117541, 158771, 405817, ...} .

The smallest prime number to yield such magic square in binary is 59 (1110112), while in ternary it is 223 (220213); these are listed at , and .

=== Variations ===

A formula_29 prime reciprocal magic square with maximum period of 16 and magic constant of 72 can be constructed where its rows represent &quot;non-consecutive&quot; multiples of one-seventeenth:

formula_30

As such, this full magic square is the first of its kind in decimal that does not admit a uniform solution where consecutive multiples of formula_12 fit in respective formula_11−th rows.

<doc id="213583" wikidata="Q466863" url="?curid=213583" title="Mount Wilson Observatory">
<text>The Mount Wilson Observatory (MWO) is an astronomical observatory in Los Angeles County, California, United States. The MWO is located on Mount Wilson, a peak in the San Gabriel Mountains near Pasadena, northeast of Los Angeles.

The observatory contains two historically important telescopes: the Hooker telescope, which was the largest aperture telescope in the world from its completion in 1917 to 1949, and the 60-inch telescope which was the largest operational telescope in the world when it was completed in 1908. It also contains the Snow solar telescope completed in 1905, the solar tower completed in 1908, the solar tower completed in 1912, and the CHARA array, built by Georgia State University, which became fully operational in 2004 and was the largest optical interferometer in the world at its completion.

Due to the inversion layer that traps warm air and smog over Los Angeles, Mount Wilson has steadier air than any other location in North America, making it ideal for astronomy and in particular for interferometry. The increasing light pollution due to the growth of greater Los Angeles has limited the ability of the observatory to engage in deep space astronomy, but it remains a productive center, with the CHARA array continuing important stellar research.

The initial efforts to mount a telescope to Mount Wilson occurred in the 1880s by one of the founders of University of Southern California, Edward Falles Spence, but he died without finishing the funding effort. The observatory was conceived and founded by George Ellery Hale, who had previously built the 1 meter telescope at the Yerkes Observatory, then the world&#x27;s largest telescope. The Mount Wilson Solar Observatory was first funded by the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1904, leasing the land from the owners of the Mount Wilson Hotel in 1904. Among the conditions of the lease was that it allow public access.

== Solar telescopes ==
There are three solar telescopes at Mount Wilson Observatory. Just one of these telescopes, the 60-foot Solar Tower, is still used for solar research.

===Snow Solar Telescope===

The Snow Solar Telescope was the first telescope installed at the fledgling Mount Wilson Solar Observatory. It was the world&#x27;s first permanently mounted solar telescope. Solar telescopes had previously been portable so they could be taken to solar eclipses around the world. The telescope was donated to Yerkes Observatory by Helen Snow of Chicago. George Ellery Hale, then director of Yerkes, had the telescope brought to Mount Wilson to put it into service as a proper scientific instrument. Its primary mirror with a focal length, coupled with a spectrograph, did groundbreaking work on the spectra of sunspots, doppler shift of the rotating solar disc and daily solar images in several wavelengths. Stellar research soon followed as the brightest stars could have their spectra recorded with very long exposures on glass plates. The Snow solar telescope is mostly used by undergraduate students who get hands-on training in solar physics and spectroscopy.
It was also used publicly for the May 9, 2016 transit of Mercury across the face of the Sun.

===60-foot Solar Tower===

The Solar Tower soon built on the work started at the Snow telescope. At its completion in 1908, the vertical tower design of the 60-foot focal length solar telescope allowed much higher resolution of the solar image and spectrum than the Snow telescope could achieve. The higher resolution came from situating the optics higher above the ground, thereby avoiding the distortion caused by the heating of the ground by the Sun. On June 25, 1908, Hale would record Zeeman splitting in the spectrum of a sunspot, showing for the first time that magnetic fields existed somewhere besides the Earth. A later discovery was of the reversed polarity in sunspots of the new solar cycle of 1912. The success of the 60-foot Tower prompted Hale to pursue yet another, taller tower telescope. In the 1960s, Robert Leighton discovered the Sun had a 5-minute oscillation and the field of helioseismology was born. The 60-foot Tower is operated by the Department of Physics and Astronomy at University of Southern California.

===150-foot Solar Tower===

The focal length solar tower expanded on the solar tower design with its tower-in-a-tower design. (The tower is actually tall.) An inner tower supports the optics above, while an outer tower, which completely surrounds the inner tower, supports the dome and floors around the optics. This design allowed complete isolation of the optics from the effect of wind swaying the tower. Two mirrors feed sunlight to a lens which focuses light down at the ground floor. It was first completed in 1910, but unsatisfactory optics caused a two-year delay before a suitable doublet lens was installed. Research included solar rotation, sunspot polarities, daily sunspot drawings, and many magnetic field studies. The solar telescope would be the world&#x27;s largest for 50 years until the McMath-Pierce Solar telescope was completed at Kitt Peak in Arizona in 1962. In 1985, UCLA took over operation of the solar tower from the Carnegie Observatories after they decided to stop funding the observatory.

== 60-inch telescope ==
For the 60-inch telescope, George Ellery Hale received the mirror blank, cast by Saint-Gobain in France, in 1896 as a gift from his father, William Hale. It was a glass disk 19 cm thick and weighing 860 kg. However it was not until 1904 that Hale received funding from the Carnegie Institution to build an observatory. Grinding began in 1905 and took two years. The mounting and structure for the telescope were built in San Francisco and barely survived the 1906 earthquake. Transporting the pieces to the top of Mount Wilson was an enormous task. First light was December 8, 1908. It was, at the time, the largest operational telescope in the world. Lord Rosse&#x27;s Leviathan of Parsonstown, a 72-inch (1.8-meter) telescope built in 1845, was, by the 1890s, out of commission.

Although slightly smaller than the Leviathan, the 60-inch had many advantages including a far better site, a glass mirror instead of speculum metal, and a precision mount which could accurately track any direction in the sky, so the 60-inch was a major advance.

The 60-inch telescope is a reflector telescope built for Newtonian, Cassegrain and coudé configurations. It is currently used in the bent Cassegrain configuration. It became one of the most productive and successful telescopes in astronomical history. Its design and light-gathering power allowed the pioneering of spectroscopic analysis, parallax measurements, nebula photography, and photometric photography. Though surpassed in size by the nine years later, the 60-inch telescope remained one of the largest in use for decades.

In 1992, the 60-inch telescope was fitted with an early adaptive optics system, the &quot;Atmospheric Compensation Experiment&quot; (ACE). The 69-channel system improved the potential resolving power of the telescope from 0.5 to 1.0 arc sec to 0.07 arc sec. ACE was developed by DARPA for the Strategic Defense Initiative system, and the National Science Foundation funded the civilian conversion.

The telescope is used for public outreach as the second largest telescope in the world devoted to the general public. Custom made 10 cm eyepieces are fitted to its focus using the bent cassegrain configuration to provide views of the Moon, planetary, and deep-sky objects. Groups may book the telescope for an evening of observing.

== 100-inch Hooker telescope ==

The Hooker telescope located at Mount Wilson Observatory, California, was completed in 1917, and was the world&#x27;s largest telescope until 1949. It is one of the most famous telescopes in observational astronomy of the 20th century. It was used by Edwin Hubble to make observations with which he produced two fundamental results which changed the scientific view of the Universe. Using observations he made in 1922–1923, Hubble was able to prove that the Universe extends beyond the Milky Way galaxy, and that several nebulae were millions of light-years away. He then showed that the universe was expanding.

=== Construction ===
Once the sixty-inch telescope project was well underway, Hale immediately set about creating a larger telescope. John D. Hooker provided crucial funding of $45,000 for the purchase and grinding of the mirror, while Andrew Carnegie provided funds to complete the telescope and dome. The Saint-Gobain factory was again chosen to cast a blank in 1906, which it completed in 1908. After considerable trouble over the blank (and potential replacements), the Hooker telescope was completed and saw &quot;first light&quot; on November 2, 1917. As with the sixty-inch telescope, the bearings are assisted by the use of mercury floats to support the 100 ton weight of the telescope.

In 1919 the Hooker telescope was equipped with a special attachment, a 6-meter optical astronomical interferometer developed by Albert A. Michelson, much larger than the one he had used to measure Jupiter&#x27;s satellites. Michelson was able to use the equipment to determine the precise diameter of stars, such as Betelgeuse, the first time the size of a star had ever been measured. Henry Norris Russell developed his star classification system based on observations using the Hooker.

In 1935 the silver coating used since 1917 on the Hooker mirror was replaced with a more modern and longer lasting aluminum coating that reflected 50% more light than the older silver coating. The newer method of coating for the telescope mirrors was first tested on the older 1.5 meter mirror.

Edwin Hubble performed many critical calculations from work on the Hooker telescope. In 1923, Hubble discovered the first Cepheid variable in the spiral nebula of Andromeda using the 2.5-meter telescope. This discovery allowed him to calculate the distance to the spiral nebula of Andromeda and show that it was actually a galaxy outside the Milky Way. Hubble, assisted by Milton L. Humason, observed the magnitude of the redshift in many galaxies and published a paper in 1929 that showed the universe is expanding.

The Hooker&#x27;s reign of three decades as the largest telescope came to an end when the Caltech-Carnegie consortium completed its Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory, 144 km south, in San Diego County, California. The Hale Telescope saw first light in January 1949.

By the 1980s, the focus of astronomy research had turned to deep space observation, which required darker skies than what could be found in the Los Angeles area, due to the ever-increasing problem of light pollution. In 1989, the Carnegie Institution, which ran the observatory, handed it over to the non-profit Mount Wilson Institute. At that time, the 2.5-meter telescope was deactivated, but it was restarted in 1992 and in 1995 it was outfitted with a visible light adaptive optics system and later in 1997, it hosted the UnISIS, laser guide star adaptive optics system.

As the use of the telescope for scientific work diminished again, a decision was made to convert it to use for visual observing. Because of the high position of the Cassegrain focus above the observing floor, a system of mirrors and lenses was developed to allow viewing from a position at the bottom of the telescope tube. With the conversion completed in 2014, the 2.5 meter telescope began its new life as the world&#x27;s largest telescope dedicated to public use. Regularly scheduled observing began with the 2015 observing season.

The telescope has a resolving power of 0.05 arcsecond.

== Interferometry ==
Astronomical interferometry has a rich history at Mount Wilson. No fewer than seven interferometers have been located here. The reason for this is the extremely steady air over Mount Wilson is well suited to interferometry, the use of multiple viewing points to increase resolution enough to allow for the direct measurement of details such as star diameters.

=== 20-foot Stellar Interferometer ===

The first of these interferometers was the 20-foot Stellar Interferometer. In 1919 the 100-inch Hooker telescope was equipped with a special attachment, a 20-foot optical astronomical interferometer developed by Albert A. Michelson and Francis G. Pease. It was attached to the end of the 100-inch telescope and used the telescope as a guiding platform to maintain alignment with the stars being studied. By December 1920, Michelson and Pease were able to use the equipment to determine the precise diameter of a star, the red giant Betelgeuse, the first time the angular size of a star had ever been measured. In the next year, Michelson and Pease measured the diameters of six more red giants before reaching the resolution limit of the 20-foot beam interferometer.

=== 50-foot Stellar Interferometer ===

To expand on the work of the 20-foot interferometer, Pease, Michelson and George E. Hale designed a 50-foot interferometer which was installed at Mount Wilson Observatory in 1929. It successfully measured the diameter of Betelgeuse, but, other than beta Andromedae, could not measure any stars not already measured by the 20-foot interferometer.

Optical interferometry reached the limit of the available technology and it took about thirty years for faster computing, electronic detectors and lasers to make larger interferometers possible again.

=== Infrared Spatial Interferometer ===
The Infrared Spatial Interferometer (ISI), run by an arm of the University of California, Berkeley, is an array of three 1.65 meter telescopes operating in the mid-infrared. The telescopes are fully mobile and their current site on Mount Wilson allows for placements as far as 70 meters apart, giving the resolution of a telescope of that diameter. The signals are converted to radio frequencies through heterodyne circuits and then combined electronically using techniques copied from radio astronomy. The longest, 70-meter baseline provides a resolution of 0.003 arcsec at a wavelength of 11 micrometers. On July 9, 2003, ISI recorded the first closure phase aperture synthesis measurements in the mid infrared.

=== CHARA array ===
The Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA), built and operated by Georgia State University, is an interferometer formed from six 1 meter telescopes arranged along three axes with a maximum separation of 330 m. The light beams travel through vacuum pipes and are delayed and combined optically, requiring a building 100 meters long with movable mirrors on carts to keep the light in phase as the Earth rotates. CHARA began scientific use in 2002 and &quot;routine operations&quot; in early 2004. In the infrared, the integrated image can resolve down to 0.0005 arcseconds. Six telescopes are in regular use for scientific observations and as of late 2005 imaging results are routinely acquired. The array captured the first image of the surface of a main sequence star other than the Sun published in early 2007.

== Other telescopes ==

A 61 cm telescope fitted with an infrared detector purchased from a military contractor was used by Eric Becklin in 1966 to determine the center of the Milky Way for the first time.

In 1968, the first large-area near-IR (2.2 μm) survey of the sky was conducted by Gerry Neugebauer and Robert B. Leighton using a 157 cm reflecting dish they had built in the early 1960s. Known as the Caltech Infrared Telescope, it operated in an unguided drift scanning mode using a lead(II) sulfide (PbS) photomultiplier read out on paper charts. The telescope is now on display at the Udvar-Hazy Center, part of the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.

== Events ==

* Letters to the Mount Wilson Observatory are the subject of a permanent exhibition at the Museum of Jurassic Technology in Los Angeles, California. A small room is dedicated to a collection of unusual letters and theories received by the observatory circa 1915–1935. These letters were also collected in the book &quot;No One May Ever Have the Same Knowledge Again: Letters to Mt. Wilson Observatory 1915–1935&quot; ().
* The historic monument came under threat during the August 2009 California wildfires.
* The English poet Alfred Noyes was present for the &quot;first light&quot; of the Hooker telescope on November 2, 1917. Noyes used this night as the setting in the opening of &quot;Watchers of the Sky,&quot; the first volume in his trilogy &quot;The Torchbearers&quot;, an epic poem about the history of science. According to his account of the night, the first object viewed in the telescope was Jupiter, and Noyes himself was the first to see one of the planet&#x27;s moons through the telescope.
* In September 2020, the observatory was evacuated due to the Bobcat Fire. Flames approached within of the observatory on September 15, but the observatory was declared safe on September 19.
* In January 2025, the observatory was evacuated due to the Eaton Fire, which approached Mount Wilson on January 9.

== Sunday Afternoon Concerts in the Dome ==
On one Sunday each month during the warmer months of the year, Mt. Wilson Observatory hosts a chamber music or jazz concert in the dome. The idea to use the dome as a venue for live music originated in 2017 from a conversation between Dan Kohne, a board member of the Mt. Wilson Institute, and Cécilia Tsan, an internationally recognized cellist. Tsan agreed that the acoustics in the dome were &quot;extraordinary&quot;, comparable to such world-renowned venues as the Palais Garnier (Opéra de Paris) and the Coolidge Auditorium at the Library of Congress. Kohne and Tsan worked together to create the series, which has run every concert season except for a break during the Covid-19 pandemic. Given that the observatory is no longer able to do significant research due to light pollution, it receives no scientific funding; the concerts therefore provide a significant portion of the budget needed to maintain the observatory as an historic landmark, along with ticketed events such as public viewing nights.

== In popular culture ==

The observatory was the primary setting of &quot;Nothing Behind the Door,&quot; the first episode of the radio series Quiet, Please which originally aired June 8, 1947.

The observatory was a filming location in a space-themed episode of &quot;Check It Out! with Dr. Steve Brule&quot;.

<doc id="213585" wikidata="Q868642" url="?curid=213585" title="Newcastle-under-Lyme">
<text>Newcastle-under-Lyme is a market town and the administrative centre of the Borough of Newcastle-under-Lyme in Staffordshire, England. It is adjacent to the city of Stoke-on-Trent. In 2021 the population was 75,082.

Newcastle grew up in the twelfth century around the castle which gave the town its name, and received its first charter in 1173. The town&#x27;s early industries included millinery, silk weaving, and coal mining, but despite its proximity to the Potteries it did not develop a ceramics trade.

==Toponym==
The name &quot;Newcastle&quot; is derived from a mid-12th century motte and bailey that was built after King Stephen granted lands in the area to Ranulf de Gernon, Earl of Chester; the land was known for his support during the civil war known as The Anarchy.

The element &quot;Lyme&quot; is found throughout the locality, such as in Lyme Brook and the Forest of Lyme. This ultimately derives from a Brythonic word related to the modern Welsh &quot;llwyf&quot;, meaning elm. Elm trees covered an extensive area across the present day counties of Cheshire, Staffordshire and parts of Derbyshire.

==History==
===12th–19th centuries===
Newcastle was not recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book, as it grew up round a 12th-century castle, but it must have gained rapid importance, as a charter, known solely through a reference in another charter to Preston, was given to the town by Henry II in 1173. The new castle superseded an older fortress at Chesterton, about to the north, whose ruins were visible up to the end of the 16th century.

In 1235 Henry III turned the town into a free borough, granting a guild and other privileges. In 1251 he leased it under a fee farm grant to the burgesses. In 1265 Newcastle was granted by the Crown to Simon de Montfort and later to Edmund Crouchback, through whom it passed to Henry IV. In John Leland&#x27;s time the castle had disappeared &quot;save one great Toure&quot;.
Newcastle did not feature much in the English Civil War, except as a victim of Royalist plundering. However, it was the home town of Major General Thomas Harrison, a Cromwellian army officer and leader of the Fifth Monarchy Men.
The (56 Geo. 3. c. &quot;33&quot; ) enclosed the common lands of the borough, and removed their common rights. They were thereafter held in trust for the burgesses of the borough. The Newcastle under Lyme Burgess Lands charity continues to exist, with entitlement to benefits going to those who would have been burgesses before the reforms of 1835: either the son of someone entitled to the trust, who was resident or occupying property within the borough&#x27;s boundaries.

The Municipal Corporations Act 1835 reformed the borough, creating a new governing charter, repealing the previous charters of 1590 and 1664. The unreformed corporation prior to 1835 had been styled the &quot;Mayor, Bailiffs and Burgesses of Newcastle-under-Lyme&quot;, but that act changed the style to &quot;Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of Newcastle-under-Lyme&quot;.

In 1835, the admission of new burgesses was forbidden by section 13 of the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 under any criteria expect that of being a ratepayer. This only affected the creation of borough burgesses, and not the entitlement rules of the Burgess Lands Trust, which continued on the historic burgess criteria.

Newcastle sent two members to Parliament from 1355 to 1885, then lost one of its seats.

===20th century===
When Stoke-on-Trent was formed by the 1910 amalgamation of the &quot;six towns&quot; (Stoke, Hanley, Fenton, Longton, Burslem and Tunstall), Newcastle remained separate.

Despite its close proximity, it was not directly involved in the pottery industry and it strongly opposed attempts to join the merger in 1930, with a postcard poll showing residents opposing the Stoke-on-Trent Extension Bill by a majority of 97.4 per cent. Although passed by the House of Commons, the bill was rejected by the House of Lords.

After the Local Government Act 1972, Newcastle became the principal settlement of the Borough of Newcastle-under-Lyme.

===Economy===
Like neighbouring Stoke-on-Trent, Newcastle&#x27;s early economy was based around the hatting trade, silk and cotton mills. Later coal mining, brick manufacture, iron casting and engineering rose to prominence. Fine red earthenware and soft-paste porcelain tableware (the first such production in Staffordshire) was produced in Newcastle at Samuel Bell&#x27;s factory in Lower Street in 1724–1754, when production ceased. Except for a failed enterprise in 1790–1797, which then switched to brewing, there was no further commercial production of pottery within the town. Production of earthenware tiles, however, continued at several locations in the borough. Manufacture of fine bone china was re-established in the borough in 1963 by Mayfair Pottery at Chesterton.

The manufacture in the borough of clay tobacco-smoking pipes started about 1637 and grew rapidly, until it was second only to hatting as an industry. Nationally, the town ranked with Chester, York and Hull as the four major pipe producers. The industry continued until the mid-19th century, when decline set in rapidly, so that by 1881 it had only one tobacco-pipe maker left.

In the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, the town had a flourishing felt hat manufacturing industry, probably at its peak locally in the 1820s, when a third of the town&#x27;s population were involved in over 20 factories, but by 1892 there was only one still in production.

In 1944, the Rolls-Royce Derwent engine for the Gloster Meteor fighter was made in the borough.

Newcastle&#x27;s 20th-century industries include: iron-working, construction materials, clothing (especially military, police and transport uniforms), computers, publishing, electric motors and machinery.

Near the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries, the town received major redevelopment to incorporate a new street (Castle Walk) into the town centre, providing Newcastle with a new bus station and bringing in more companies. Various business centres in the town provide offices for companies that operate in the service sector.

The town was classed as a BID (business improvement district) in 2015, reiterated in 2021.

===Politicians===

The town has been the birthplace of several notable politicians and activists. Fanny Deakin was a campaigner for better nourishment for babies and young children and better maternity care for mothers. The former chairwoman of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), Janet Bloomfield (née Hood) is a peace and disarmament campaigner. Vera Brittain. writer, feminist (and mother of Labour Party Minister and later Liberal Democrat Shirley Williams) was born in the town.

There have been two particularly notable Members of Parliament (MPs). Josiah Wedgwood IV was a Liberal, Independent and Labour Party MP, who served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in the cabinet of Ramsay MacDonald, in the first ever Labour government. He was an MP from 1909 to 1942. John Golding was elected a Labour MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme at a by-election in 1969. He served in the governments of Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan, as PPS to Eric Varley as Minister of Technology, a Labour whip in opposition, and Minister for Employment, stepping down in 1986.

The current MP is Adam Jogee.

===Transport===
The town was once served by the North Staffordshire Railway, its station being on a branch from Stoke-on-Trent via Newcastle, Silverdale and Keele, to Market Drayton in Shropshire. Newcastle-under-Lyme railway station opened in September 1852, after numerous construction difficulties involving the two tunnels of and at Hartshill. There were also two halts to the west of Newcastle railway station, located at Brampton and Liverpool Road.

The section from Silverdale to Market Drayton closed to passengers in May 1956 and the rest of the line in March 1964. Only small sections remained from Madeley to Silverdale, and from Silverdale to Holditch, for coal traffic from the local collieries. The line from Newcastle Junction to Silverdale has been removed, and the site of Newcastle railway station and the Hartshill tunnels filled in.

Newcastle was on the national canal network, but the Newcastle-under-Lyme Canal running from the Trent and Mersey Canal at Stoke-on-Trent to Sir Nigel Gresley&#x27;s Canal has been disused since 1935 and mostly filled in.

Today the town relies on buses for public transport. FirstGroup runs a network of services connecting Newcastle to the towns of the Potteries and to Stafford. Arriva buses run to Shrewsbury via Market Drayton

==Geography==
Situated in a valley alongside the Lyme Brook, the town is just west of the city of Stoke-on-Trent, its suburbs running together. Newcastle town centre is less than from Stoke-on-Trent City Centre, about north of Stafford and south of the Cheshire county border and from the Shropshire county border.

===Green belt===

Newcastle and Stoke form the main urban area at the centre of the Stoke-on-Trent Green Belt, which is an environmental and planning area that regulates the rural space in Staffordshire, to prevent urban sprawl and minimise convergence with outlying settlements. First defined in 1967, most of the area extends into the wider borough, but some landscape features and places of interest within that are covered or surrounded. They include the Michelin Sports Facility, Newcastle golf course, Keele University, Apedale Winding Wheel, Watermills Chimney and Bignall Hill.

Jewish residency of the area stretches back into the 19th century. In 1873 the community purchased an old Welsh chapel to be used as a synagogue. In 1923 a new synagogue was built in Hanley. This was closed in 2004 and the moved to a smaller synagogue in Newcastle.

==Transport==

Newcastle-under-Lyme is served by the M6 motorway to the south and west of Newcastle and by the A500 road to the north and east. There are access points from the M6 at junctions 15 and 16, to the south and north respectively. The A34 trunk road runs through Newcastle from north to south and was the main road between Birmingham and Manchester until the M6 motorway opened. There is a large bus station in the town centre.
Newcastle-under-Lyme railway station, which was not within the town but towards Water Street on the Stoke to Market Drayton Line, closed in 1964 under the Beeching cuts. The line from Silverdale to Pipe Gate remained open to serve Silverdale Colliery and a creamery at Pipe Gate until 1998, when the line closed to all stone and mineral traffic. It now forms part of a green way from Silverdale to Newcastle-under-Lyme, with the station site being called &quot;Station Walks&quot;. The nearest station to the town is Stoke-on-Trent railway station which is between the town centre of Newcastle and city centre of Stoke-on-Trent and serves the Potteries as a whole. Newcastle is the third-largest town in England (by population) to have no railway station.

Most of the bus network is run by First Potteries Limited and D&amp;G Bus.

The town has a private school: Newcastle-under-Lyme School, which was established in the 17th century, whose alumni includes T. E. Hulme, John Wain and William Watkiss Lloyd.

The town features several parks, including the Queen&#x27;s Gardens at the east end of Ironmarket, which won the Britain in Bloom Judges&#x27; Award for Horticultural Excellence in 2003. Queens Gardens contains a statue of Queen Victoria funded by Sir Alfred Seale Haslam and unveiled by Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich of Russia on 5 November 1903. It is the only park within the ring road.

To the north-west of the town centre is Brampton Park, home to a museum and art gallery.

===Traditional market===
Dating back to 1173 Newcastle&#x27;s market, known as the Stones, operates on the High Street. The market was originally held on Sunday; in the reign of John it was changed to Saturday; by the charter of Elizabeth it was fixed on Monday. Grants of fairs were given by Edward I, Edward III and Henry VI.

Today the market is open six days a week and has over 80 stalls. Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays have a general market, Tuesdays an antiques market and Thursdays a sale of bric-a-brac. A cattle and livestock market was held on Mondays until the early 1990s; the site of it is now a branch of Morrison&#x27;s supermarket.

===The Guildhall===
The current Guildhall was built in 1713 and has undergone a number of changes. Originally the ground floor was open and was used for markets, until the Market Hall was built in 1854. In 1860, to provide more space, the ground floor arches were bricked up and a clock tower with four clocks added. The top rooms in the Guildhall were used for meetings by the borough council. It is now a Grade II listed building.

===The Barracks===
The Italian-style Militia Barracks were built in 1855 of red brick. They were the headquarters of the 3rd King&#x27;s Own Staffordshire Rifle Regiment until 1880. In 1882 W. H. Dalton bought the Barracks and settled them in trust for use by the Rifle Volunteers of Newcastle, which became the Territorial Force in 1907. In 2002 the Barracks were let to small businesses.

==Culture==

The New Vic Theatre is a theatre in the round. Just outside the town centre, it offers a programme that includes modern and classic plays and concert performances.

The Borough Museum and Art Gallery (Brampton Museum) depicts the civic history of the Borough and an authentic, life-size Victorian street-scene. The art gallery hosts work by local and national artists, and travelling exhibitions.

Notable residents who contributed to the arts and entertainment include Philip Astley, founder of the modern circus. Jackie Trent, the singer and songwriter, was born in the town. Arnold Bennett, the novelist, playwright, and essayist, completed his schooling at the Middle School, and called the town Oldcastle in his &quot;Clayhanger&quot; trilogy of novels. Dinah Maria Mulock, who wrote under her married name of Mrs Craik, lived in the town (in Lower Street and Mount Pleasant) and attended Brampton House Academy.

E. S. Turner, social commentator, was educated in the town. Newcastle was home to Dr Philip Willoughby-Higson (1933–2012), poet, translator, historian, and author of 33 books. He founded and was president (1974–1992) of the Chester Poets, the oldest poetry group in the North-West. He was also President of the Baudelaire Society of France from 1992 to 2012 – the only Englishman ever to hold that position.

==Religion==

The town was the birthplace of John James Blunt, a divine and Anglican priest. Josiah Wedgwood was a Unitarian and he and his family attended meetings at the Old Meeting House, adjacent to St Giles&#x27; Church, which is still in use for the purpose.

The town has a number of Anglican churches, including St Giles, a medieval parish church dating from 1290. There are several Catholic churches, notably Holy Trinity, whose style is Gothic in blue engineering bricks, described as &quot;the finest modern specimen of ornamental brickwork in the kingdom&quot; at the time.
In the 18th century John Wesley made repeated visits to the area, which was becoming industrialised, and recruited many residents to Methodism. This is reflected in a number of Methodist churches. There is a Baptist church in Clayton.

Of interest is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), across from Brampton Park, which serves as the &quot;Stake Centre&quot; for the church in the region and has an on-site Family History Centre, where the public can research their ancestry at little or no charge.

==International network==
The town is part of a worldwide network of towns and cities with the name Newcastle. These include well-known Newcastle upon Tyne (also in England), Neuburg an der Donau (Germany), Neuchâtel (Switzerland), Neufchâteau (France), New Castle, Indiana (US), New Castle, Pennsylvania (US), New Castle, Delaware (US), Newcastle, KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa) and Shinshiro (Japan).

This small international network of eight towns, formed in 1998, is designed to encourage friendship and cooperation between them. Accordingly, a school in the South African town benefited in 2004 from gifts of computing equipment surplus to Newcastle-under-Lyme&#x27;s needs. The annual &quot;Newcastles of the World&quot; Summit was held in Newcastle-under-Lyme for six days from 17 June 2006.

<text>A pretzel ( ; from or , ) is a type of baked pastry made from dough that is commonly shaped into a knot. The traditional pretzel shape is a distinctive symmetrical form, with the ends of a long strip of dough intertwined and then twisted back onto itself in a particular way (a pretzel loop or pretzel bow). Today, pretzels come in various shapes, textures, and colors, but the original soft pretzel is still one of the most common pretzel types to date.

Salt is the most common seasoning, or topping, for pretzels, complementing the washing soda or lye treatment that gives pretzels their traditional skin and flavor acquired through the Maillard reaction. Other toppings are mustard, cheeses, sugar, chocolate, cinnamon, sweet glazing, seeds, and nuts. Varieties of pretzels include soft pretzels, which should be eaten shortly after preparation, and hard-baked pretzels, which have a long shelf life.

== History ==
There are numerous accounts regarding the origin of pretzels, as well as the origin of the name; most state that they have Christian backgrounds and were invented by European monks. According to some scholars and various sources, the most popular story is that the pretzel was made in 610 AD by an Italian monk when he decided to make a special treat to help motivate his students to keep on learning. He rolled out a few strips of dough and crossed them to try and resemble two hands praying, and after he baked it, the pretzel was born. After they were done baking, he handed them out to his students and said &quot;pretiola&quot; (little rewards). Another source locates the invention in a monastery in southern France. In Germany, there are stories that pretzels were the invention of desperate bakers held hostage by local dignitaries.

The German name &quot;Brezel&quot; may derive also from Latin (a medieval term for &#x27;bracelet&#x27;), or &quot;&quot; (&#x27;little arms&#x27;).

The pretzel has been in use as an emblem of bakers and formerly their guilds in southern German areas since at least the 12th century. A 12th-century illustration of the banquet of Queen Esther and King Ahasuerus in the &quot;Hortus deliciarum&quot; from the Alsace region (today France) may contain the earliest depiction of a pretzel.

Within the Christian Church, pretzels were regarded as having religious significance for both ingredients and shape. Pretzels made with a simple recipe using only flour and water could be eaten during Lent when Christians were forbidden to eat eggs, lard, or dairy products such as milk and butter (cf. Daniel Fast). As time passed, pretzels became associated with both Lent and Easter. Pretzels were hidden on Easter morning just as eggs are hidden today, and are particularly associated with Lent, fasting and prayers before Easter.

Like the holes in the hubs of round Finnish flatbread, ruisreikäleipä, which let them be hung on poles suspended just below the kitchen ceiling, the loops in pretzels may have served a practical purpose: bakers could hang them on sticks, for instance, projecting upwards from a central column, as shown in a painting by Job Berckheyde (1630–1693) from around 1681.

Pretzel baking has most firmly taken root in the region of Franconia and adjoining Upper German-speaking areas, and pretzels have been an integral part of German baking traditions for centuries. Lye pretzels are popular in southern Germany, Alsace, Austria, and German-speaking Switzerland as a variety of bread, a side dish or a snack, and come in many local varieties. Examples for pretzel names in various Upper-German dialects are &quot;Breze&quot;, &quot;Brezn&quot;, &quot;Bretzel&quot;, &quot;Brezzl&quot;, &quot;Brezgen&quot;, &quot;Bretzga&quot;, &quot;Bretzet&quot;, &quot;Bretschl&quot;, &quot;Kringel&quot;, &quot;Silserli,&quot; and &quot;Sülzerli&quot;. Baked for consumption on the same day, they are sold in every bakery and in special booths or stands in downtown streets. Often, they are sliced horizontally, buttered, and sold as &quot;Butterbrezel&quot;, or come with slices of cold meats or cheese. Butter-filled pretzels are also commonly sold under this name. Sesame, poppy, sunflower, pumpkin, or caraway seeds, melted cheese, and bacon bits are other popular toppings. Some bakeries offer pretzels made of different flours, such as whole wheat, rye or spelt.

In Bavaria, lye pretzels accompany a main dish, such as Weisswurst sausage. The same dough and baking procedure with lye and salt is used to make other kinds of &quot;lye pastry&quot; (&quot;Laugengebäck&quot;): lye rolls, buns, croissants, and even loaves (&quot;Laugenbrötchen&quot;, &quot;Laugenstangen&quot;, &quot;Laugencroissants&quot;, &quot;Laugenbrot&quot;). Yet, in some parts of Bavaria, especially in lower Bavaria, unglazed &quot;white&quot; pretzels, sprinkled with salt and caraway seeds are still popular. Basically, with the same ingredients, lye pretzels come in numerous local varieties. Sizes are usually similar; the main differences are the thickness of the dough, the content of fat and the degree of baking. Typical Swabian pretzels, for example, have very thin &quot;arms&quot; and a &quot;fat belly&quot; with a split, and a higher fat content. The thicker part makes it easier to slice them for the use of sandwiches. In Bavarian pretzels, the arms are left thicker so they do not bake to a crisp and contain very little fat. Oversized pretzels are often sold at fairs or beer festivals.

The pretzel shape is used for a variety of sweet pastries made of different types of dough (flaky, brittle, soft, crispy) with a variety of toppings (icing, nuts, seeds, cinnamon). Around Christmas, they can be made of soft gingerbread (&quot;Lebkuchen&quot;) with chocolate coating. In southern Germany and adjoining German-speaking areas, pretzels have retained their original religious meanings and are still used in various traditions and festivals. In some areas, on 1 January, people give each other lightly sweetened yeast pretzels for good luck and good fortune. These &quot;New Year&#x27;s pretzels&quot; are made in different sizes and can have a width of and more. Sometimes children visit their godparents to fetch their New Years pretzel. On 1 May, love-struck boys used to paint a pretzel on the doors of the adored. On the other hand, an upside-down pretzel would have been a sign of disgrace. Especially Catholic areas, such as Austria, Bavaria, or some parts of Swabia, the &quot;Palm pretzel&quot; is made for Palm Sunday celebrations. Sizes can range from up to and they can weigh up to . An old tradition on Palm Sunday dating back to 1533 is the outdoor pretzel market (&quot;Brezgenmarkt&quot;) in the Hungerbrunnen Valley near Heldenfingen.

In the Rhineland region, sweet pretzels are made with pudding-filled loops (pudding pretzels). On Laetare Sunday in Luxembourg, the fourth Sunday in Lent, there is a festival called &quot;Pretzel Sunday&quot;. Boys give their girlfriends pretzels or cakes in pretzel form. The size symbolizes how much he likes her. In return, if a girl wants to increase his attention, she will give him a decorated egg on Easter. The pretzel custom is reversed on Pretzel Sunday during leap years. This custom also still exists in some areas of the Swabian Alb. On the same occasion in Rhenish Hesse and the Palatinate, people have parades carrying big pretzels mounted on colourful decorated poles.

During Lent in Biberach, &quot;Lent pretzels&quot; are popular. These are briefly boiled in water before baking and then sprinkled with salt. Schloss Burg is renowned for a 200-year-old specialty, the &quot;Burger pretzel&quot;. Its texture and flavour resemble rusk or zwieback. A local story says that the recipe came from a grateful Napoleonic soldier in 1795, whose wounds were treated by a baker&#x27;s family in the little town of Burg. The cultural importance of the pretzel for Burg is expressed by a monument in honour of the pretzel bakers, and by an 18 km hiking trail nearby called &quot;Pretzel Hiking Trail&quot;.

A variety typical for Upper Franconia is the &quot;anise pretzel&quot;. The town of Weidenberg celebrates the &quot;Pretzel weeks&quot; during the carnival season when anise flavored pretzels are served with special dishes such as cooked meat with horseradish or roast.
In the city of Lübeck, the 500-year-old guild of boatmen on the Stecknitz Canal call their annual meetings in January &quot;Kringelhöge&quot; (Pretzelfun). The elaborate affair, with about 200 participants, is celebrated as a breakfast with beer and includes Mass in the Lübeck Cathedral and a presentation of songs by a children&#x27;s choir. In earlier times, the children were very poor, coming from an orphanage, and each received a &quot;Kringel&quot; (pretzel) as a reward. Hence, the name &quot;Pretzelfun&quot; was adopted, because this gift was considered a highlight. Today, the children come from schools, but they still get the pretzels.

The city of Osnabrück celebrates the anniversary of the Peace of Westphalia (1648) and organizes an annual hobby horse race for grade-four children. On finishing the race, they are presented with a sweet pretzel. In heraldry, the city seal of Nörten dates from around 1550 and depicts two facing lions holding a pretzel at the center.

The lye pretzel is the theme for a number of festivals in Germany. The city of Speyer prides itself to be the &quot;pretzel town&quot;, and around the second weekend of July, from Friday to Tuesday, it holds an annual funfair and festival called &quot;Brezelfest&quot;, which is the largest beer festival in the Upper Rhine region, and attracts around 300,000 visitors. The festival includes a parade with over 100 bands, floats, and clubs participating from the whole region, and 22,000 pretzels are thrown among the crowds. On the market square of Speyer, there is a fountain with a statue of a boy selling pretzels. The pretzel booths on the main street are permanently installed and were specially designed when the whole downtown area was redone for the 100th anniversary. One-day pretzel fests and markets in other German towns are in Kirchhellen, a borough of Bottrop, or in Kornwestheim. In 2003 and 2004, &quot;Peace Pretzels&quot; were baked for a UNICEF charity event and other charity purposes in Munich. Instead of the typical pretzel loop, they were made in the similar shape of a peace symbol.

=== United States ===

In the late 18th century, southern German and Swiss German immigrants introduced the pretzel to North America. The immigrants became known as the Pennsylvania Dutch, and in time, many handmade pretzel bakeries populated the central Pennsylvania countryside, and the pretzel&#x27;s popularity spread.

In the 20th century, soft pretzels became popular in other regions of the United States. Cities such as Philadelphia, Chicago, and New York became renowned for their soft pretzels. The key to success was the introduction of the new mass production methods of the industrialized age, which increased the availability and quantity, and the opening up of multiple points of distribution at schools, convenience and grocery stores, and entertainment venues such as movie theaters, arenas, concert halls, and sport stadiums. Prior to that, street vendors used to sell pretzels on street corners in wooden glass-enclosed cases.

In the U.S., pretzels come in many varieties of flavors and coatings, such as yogurt, chocolate, strawberry, mustard, cinnamon sugar, cheese and others, and chocolate-covered hard pretzels are popular around Christmas time and given as gifts. The variety of shapes and sizes became a contest of imagination in the marketing of the pretzels taste. During the 1900s, people in Philadelphia would use the small slender pretzel stick as a common accompaniment to ice cream or would crumble pretzels as a topping. This combination of cold sweet and salty taste was very popular for many years. Eventually, this led to the development of an ice cream cone tasting like a pretzel. More recently Mars, Incorporated manufactures M&amp;M&#x27;s with a small spherical pretzel covered in milk chocolate and candy coated in all of the standard M&amp;M&#x27;s colors, called &quot;Pretzel M&amp;M&#x27;s&quot;. Soft pretzels are frequently sold in shopping malls, with notable chains including Auntie Anne&#x27;s and Wetzel&#x27;s Pretzels/Pretzel Time.

====Pennsylvania====

Southeastern Pennsylvania, with its large population of German background, including the Pennsylvania Dutch, is considered the birthplace of the American pretzel industry, and many pretzel bakers are still located in the area. Pennsylvania produces 80% of the nation&#x27;s pretzels.

Hard pretzels originated in the United States, where, in 1850, the Sturgis bakery in Lititz, Pennsylvania, became the first commercial hard pretzel bakery. Snack food hard pretzels are made in the form of loops, braids, letters, little pretzels, or sticks around thick and long; they have become a popular snack in many countries around the world. A thicker variety of sticks can be thick; in the U. S. these are called Bavarian pretzels or pretzel rods. Unlike the soft pretzels, these were durable when kept in an airtight environment and marketable in a variety of convenience stores. Large-scale production began in the first half of the 1900s, more so during 1930 to 1950. A prime example was in 1949, when highly innovative American Machine and Foundry Co., of New York City, developed the &quot;pretzel bender&quot;: a new automatic crispy-styled baked pretzel-twisting machine that rolled and tied them at the rate of 50 a minute—more than twice as fast as skilled hand twisters could make them—and conveyed them through the baking and salting process.

The annual United States pretzel industry is worth over $1.2 billion. The average American consumes about of pretzels per year. The privately run Pretzel Museum opened in Philadelphia in 1993, but is now defunct. In 2003, Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell declared 26 April &quot;National Pretzel Day&quot; to acknowledge the importance of the pretzel to the state&#x27;s history and economy. Philly Pretzel Factory stores offer a free pretzel to each customer on this day. In Altoona, Pennsylvania, the Benzel&#x27;s pretzel company calls them &quot;bretzels&quot;, both for the alliteration and as a nod to their German heritage.

The S-shaped soft pretzel, often served with brown mustard, became very popular in Philadelphia and was established as a part of Philadelphia&#x27;s cuisine for snacking at school, work, or home, and considered by most to be a quick meal. The average Philadelphian today consumes about twelve times as many pretzels as the national average.

==== Other regions ====
Freeport, Illinois, which sits about 100 miles outside of Chicago, is another city known for its rich pretzel history. In 1869, a German immigrant named John Billerbeck established the first Billerbeck Bakery which was known for selling German style pretzels to complement the large number of breweries that existed in Freeport during this time. Prohibition eventually shut down the breweries which led to the decline of pretzel sales in Freeport, but the city never lost its pretzel pride. For more than 100 years, Freeport has been known as &quot;Pretzel City, USA.&quot; Their high school athletic mascot is the Pretzel and the football stadium has been appropriately named &quot;Pretzel Field.&quot; In 2003, local citizens launched Freeport&#x27;s first Pretzel Festival which is a large community event where residents get together to celebrate the city&#x27;s pretzel history. Contestants are chosen to be crowned Pretzel Prince and Princess and a festival mascot by the name of &quot;Pretzel Bill&quot; (stemming from the Billerbeck Bakery name) dresses as a 6-foot tall walking talking pretzel who hands out pretzels from floats and takes photos with the local festival goers.

=== Other countries ===
The looped pretzel is known in other European countries and in other countries around the world.

In Hungary it is called perec, a softer variant of the German pastry, usually eaten with cheese or salt-syrup baked on it.

In Romania, the pretzel is known as a variety of &quot;covrigi;&quot; it is a very common street food.

In Sweden it is called kringlor, a small pretzel often covered with chocolate.
== In popular culture ==
The pretzel has become an element in popular culture, both as a food staple, and its unique knotted twist shape which has inspired ideas, perspectives, attitudes, memes, images, and other phenomena. Although historically, the pretzel has influenced culture, it has recently been heavily influenced by mass media.

Landscape architecture and sculpture memorialized the strong identity that the city of Philadelphia had with pretzel cuisine of local bakers and popularity in Philadelphia. The Philadelphia Recreation Department renamed in 2004 a facility formerly identified as Manayunk Park, located on the 4300 block of Silverwood Street as &quot;Pretzel Park&quot;. The re-designed park includes pretzel-like looped pathways and a public art statue in the shape of a pretzel sculpted by Warren C. Holzman. The municipal government of the City of Freeport, Illinois, also known as &quot;Pretzel City USA&quot;, have also adopted a pretzel logo as their trademark.

The pretzel dance move was part of swing dancing in the 1920s.

The &quot;pretzel&quot; bikini bathing suit design, a variant of the sling swimsuit, emerged in the early 1990s, produced by Spandex. It is a haltered maillot that crisscrosses the front and fastens to the waistline. Made from Lycra, these bikinis became most popular on the beaches of Europe, including Saint-Tropez, Marbella, Mykonos, and Ibiza.

A circulating internet video shows a press conference of US president George W. Bush from January 2002, in which he recalls choking on a pretzel: &quot;When you&#x27;re eating pretzels, chew before you swallow. Listen to your mother.&quot;

<doc id="213595" wikidata="Q409079" url="?curid=213595" title="Aldose">
<text>An aldose is a monosaccharide (a simple sugar) with a carbon backbone chain with a carbonyl group on the endmost carbon atom, making it an aldehyde, and hydroxyl groups connected to all the other carbon atoms. Aldoses can be distinguished from ketoses, which have the carbonyl group away from the end of the molecule, and are therefore ketones.

==Structure==
Like most carbohydrates, simple aldoses have the general chemical formula C&quot;n&quot;(H2O)&quot;n&quot;. Because formaldehyde (n=1) and glycolaldehyde (n=2) are not generally considered to be carbohydrates, the simplest possible aldose is the triose glyceraldehyde, which only contains three carbon atoms.

Because they have at least one asymmetric carbon center, all aldoses exhibit stereoisomerism. Aldoses can exist in either a - form or - form. The determination is made based on the chirality of the asymmetric carbon furthest from the aldehyde end, namely the second-last carbon in the chain. Aldoses with alcohol groups on the right of the Fischer projection are -aldoses, and those with alcohols on the left are -aldoses. -aldoses are more common than -aldoses in nature.

Examples of aldoses include glyceraldehyde, erythrose, ribose, glucose and galactose. Ketoses and aldoses can be chemically differentiated through Seliwanoff&#x27;s test, where the sample is heated with acid and resorcinol. The test relies on the dehydration reaction which occurs more quickly in ketoses, so that while aldoses react slowly, producing a light pink color, ketoses react more quickly and strongly to produce a dark red color.

Aldoses can isomerize to ketoses through the Lobry-de Bruyn-van Ekenstein transformation.

==Nomenclature and common aldoses==
Aldoses are differentiated by the number of carbon atoms in the main chain. The minimum number of carbon atoms in a backbone needed to form a molecule that is still considered a carbohydrate is 3, and carbohydrates with three carbon atoms are called trioses. The only aldotriose is glyceraldehyde, which has one chiral stereocenter with 2 possible enantiomers, - and -glyceraldehyde.

Some common aldoses are:
*Triose: glyceraldehyde
*Tetroses: erythrose, threose
*Pentoses: ribose, arabinose, xylose, lyxose
*Hexoses: glucose
The most commonly discussed category of aldoses are those with six carbon atoms, aldohexoses. Some aldohexoses that are widely called by common names are:
* -(+)-Allose
* -(+)-Altrose
* -(+)-Glucose
* -(+)-Mannose
* -(−)-Gulose
* -(+)-Idose
* -(+)-Galactose
* -(+)-Talose

== Stereochemistry ==

Aldoses are commonly referred to by names specific to one stereoisomer of the compound. This distinction is especially vital in biochemistry, as many systems can only use one enantiomer of the carbohydrate and not the other. However, aldoses are not locked into any one conformation: they can and do fluctuate between different forms.

Aldoses can tautomerize to ketoses in a dynamic process with an enol intermediate (more specifically, an enediol). This process is reversible, so aldoses and ketoses can be thought of as being in equilibrium with each other. However, aldehydes and ketones are almost always more stable than the corresponding enol forms, so the aldo- and keto- forms normally predominate. This process, with its enol intermediate, also allows stereoisomerization. Basic solutions accelerate the interconversion of isomers.

Carbohydrates with more than four carbon atoms exist in an equilibrium between the closed ring, or cyclic form, and the open-chain form. Cyclic aldoses are usually drawn as Haworth projections, and open chain forms are commonly drawn as Fischer projections, both of which represent important stereochemical information about the forms they depict.

<doc id="213600" wikidata="Q1410337" url="?curid=213600" title="Ffestiniog Railway">
<text>The Ffestiniog Railway () is a heritage railway based on narrow-gauge, located in Gwynedd, Wales. It is a major tourist attraction located mainly within the Snowdonia National Park.

The railway is roughly long and runs from the harbour at Porthmadog to the slate mining town of Blaenau Ffestiniog, travelling through forested and mountainous terrain. The line is single track throughout with four intermediate passing places. The first mile of the line out of Porthmadog runs atop an embankment called &quot;the Cob&quot;, which is the dyke of the polder known as Traeth Mawr.

The Festiniog Railway Company, which owns the railway, is the oldest surviving railway company in the world. It also owns the Welsh Highland Railway, which was re-opened fully in 2011. The two railways share the same track gauge and meet at Porthmadog station, with occasional trains working the entire route from Blaenau Ffestiniog to Caernarfon.

== History ==

The railway company is properly known as the &quot;Festiniog Railway Company&quot;. The single &quot;F&quot; spelling is in the official title of the company in the local act, the Festiniog Railway Act 1832 (2 &amp; 3 Will. 4. c. xlviii) that created the railway. It is the oldest surviving railway company in the world (although not the oldest working railway – a record that goes to the Middleton Railway, in Leeds), having been founded by the act of Parliament on 23 May 1832 with capital mostly raised in Dublin by Henry Archer, the company&#x27;s first secretary and managing director. Most British railways were amalgamated into four large groups in 1921 and then into British Railways in 1948 but the Festiniog Railway Company, like most narrow-gauge railways, remained independent. In 1921, this was due to political influence, whereas in 1947 it was left out of British Railways because it was closed for traffic, despite vigorous local lobbying for it to be included.

Various important developments in the railway&#x27;s early history were celebrated by the firing of rock cannon at various points along the line. Cannon were fired, for instance, to mark the laying of the first stone at Creuau in 1833, the railway&#x27;s opening in 1836, and the opening of the Moelwyn Tunnel in 1842. The passing of a later act for the railway also saw cannon celebrations, but on this occasion, a fitter at Boston Lodge, who was assisting with firing, lost the fingers of one hand in an accident.

===Horse and gravity operation===
The line was constructed between 1833 and 1836 to transport slate from the quarries around the inland town of Blaenau Ffestiniog to the coastal town of Porthmadog where it was loaded onto ships. The railway was graded so that loaded wagons could be run by gravity downhill all the way from Blaenau Ffestiniog to the port. The empty wagons were hauled back up by horses, which travelled down in special &#x27;dandy&#x27; wagons. To achieve this continuous grade (about 1 in 80 for much of the way), the line followed natural contours and employed cuttings and embankments built of stone and slate blocks without mortar. Prior to the completion in 1842 of a long tunnel through a spur in the Moelwyn Mountain, the slate trains were worked over the top via inclines (designed by Robert Stephenson), the site of which can still be seen although there are few visible remnants.

Up to six trains daily were operated in each direction and a printed timetable was published on 16 September 1856 by Charles Easton Spooner who, following his father, served as Manager and Clerk for 30 years. It shows departures from the Quarry Terminus (later referred to as Dinas, sometimes as Rhiwbryfdir or Rhiw) at 7:30, 9:28, 11:16, 1:14, 3:12 and 5:10. Trains waited ten minutes at the intermediate stations called Tunnel Halt, Hafod y Llyn and Rhiw Goch. The fastest journey time from Quarry Terminus to Boston Lodge was 1 hour 32 minutes, including three stops. From Boston Lodge, the slate wagons were hauled to and from Porthmadog harbour by horses. Up trains took nearly six hours from Boston Lodge to the Quarry Terminus and each train ran in up to four sections, each hauled by a horse and comprising eight empty slate wagons plus a horse dandy. This timetable gave a maximum annual capacity of 70,000 tons of dressed slate. Two brakesmen travelled on each down train, controlling the speed by the application of brakes as needed. At passing loops, trains passed on the right and this continues to be a feature of Ffestiniog Railway operation.

There is evidence for tourist passengers being carried as early as 1850 without the blessing of the Board of Trade, but these journeys would also observe the timetable.

Hafod y Llyn was replaced by Tan y Bwlch around 1872. Dinas (Rhiw) Station and much of that branch is now all but buried under slate waste; the rest of the Dinas branch line was removed about 1954–55. Occasional confusion arises because places named Hafod y Llyn Isaf and Dinas also exist on the Welsh Highland Railway, albeit or more to the northwest of those on the FR.

===Steam and gravity operation===

During the late 1850s it became clear that the line was reaching its operational capacity, while the output of the Blaenau Ffestiniog slate quarries continued to rise. In 1860, the board of the company began to investigate the possibility of introducing steam locomotives to increase the carrying capacity of the railway. Although narrow-gauge steam locomotives had been tried before this, very few had been built to so narrow a gauge. In 1862 the company advertised for manufacturers to tender to build the line&#x27;s first locomotives. In February 1863, the bid of George England and Co. was accepted and production of the first locomotives was begun.

The first of these locomotives, &quot;Mountaineer&quot; was delivered to Porthmadog on 18 July 1863, followed a few days later by &quot;The Princess&quot;. After a number of trials and some modifications (notably the addition of domes) to the locomotive, the first official train ran on 23 October 1863. These steam locomotives of the 0-4-0 type allowed much longer slate trains to be run and this also enabled the official introduction of passenger trains in 1865: the Ffestiniog was the first narrow-gauge railway in Britain to carry passengers. In 1869, the line&#x27;s first double Fairlie articulated locomotive was introduced and these double-ended machines have since become one of the most widely recognised features of the railway.

Down trains continued to run entirely by gravity but faster up journeys and longer trains increased line capacity. A new timetable dated October 1863 shows six departures daily from each terminus at two-hour intervals, starting at 7:00 am and taking 1 hour 50 minutes including stops (totalling 20 minutes) at Tanygrisiau, Hafod-y-Llyn and Penrhyn. Trains passed only at Hafod-y-Llyn (from 1872 Tan-y-Bwlch). When passenger services started, the usual practice was for locomotive-hauled up trains to consist of loaded general goods and mineral wagons, followed by passenger carriages, followed by empty slate wagons with brakesmen. Down trains were run in up to four separate (uncoupled) portions: loaded slate wagons, goods wagons, passenger carriages and the locomotive running light. This unusual and labour-intensive method of operation was highly dangerous, at least as far as passengers were concerned; consequently, the down passenger and goods portions were combined into a single train headed by the locomotive.

The loaded slate trains continued to operate by gravity until the end of passenger services in 1939. Slate trains eventually became very long – trains of less than eighty slate wagons carried two brakesmen but over eighty wagons (and this became common) required three brakesmen. About one wagon in every six was equipped with a brake, the others being unbraked. Trains continued to pass at Tan-y-Bwlch and, to a lesser extent, at Minffordd. The Summer timetable for 1900 had nine trains daily in each direction and trains had been accelerated to one hour from Porthmadog to including stops at Minffordd, Penrhyn, Tan-y-Bwlch, Dduallt (request), Tanygrisiau, Blaenau (LNWR) and Blaenau (GWR). Speeds in excess of were then normal.

The original passenger coaches (some of which survive) were small four-wheeled vehicles with a very low centre of gravity, which led to them being nicknamed &#x27;bug boxes&#x27;. In 1872, the FR introduced the first bogie carriages to operate in Britain, Nos 15 and 16, which were also the first iron-framed bogie coaches in the world and are still in service. The continuous vacuum brake was installed in 1893. The line was fully signalled with electric telegraph and staff and ticket working. Electric Train Staff instruments were introduced in 1912 and they continue in use to the present day.

===Decline of slate and development of tourism===
By the 1920s, the demand for slate as a roofing material dropped owing to the advent of newer materials and to the loss of the overseas trade during World War I. As a result, the railway suffered a gradual decline in traffic.

In 1921, the Aluminium Corporation at Dolgarrog in the Conwy Valley bought for £40,000 (£ in ), a controlling interest in the FR and Henry Jack became Chairman, the FR company&#x27;s financial administration moving to Dolgarrog. Jack was also chairman of the new Welsh Highland Railway. He was instrumental in getting government backing for its completion on the understanding that the FR and the WHR would be jointly managed from Porthmadog, with maintenance undertaken at Boston Lodge and with other economies of scale. In 1923, the FR line was joined to the WHR line at a station called &quot;Portmadoc New&quot;. The Welsh Highland line was almost totally dependent on tourism, but this proved slow to develop for several reasons: two slumps in the early 1920s and early 1930s; the rise of road traffic including charabancs; and the unreliability of the railway with its (even then) ancient carriages and increasingly decrepit locomotives.
Light railway operation was being introduced on the FR and WHR to cut operating overheads. In 1923, to gain additional expertise in this, Colonel H. F. Stephens was appointed as part-time engineer to both companies. Stephens became Chairman and Managing Director of both companies in 1924. When the WHR was taken into receivership in 1927, Colonel Stephens was appointed as Receiver for the WHR and financial administration of both companies moved to Tonbridge in Kent. The fortunes of the WHR, despite great efforts, failed to improve and it became bankrupt in 1933. To protect their investments, the joint owners of both companies arranged for the WHR to be leased by the FR. However the WHR losses continued with the loss of the Moel Tryfan slate traffic in 1935, and it closed to passengers at the end of the 1936 season and to goods in 1937.

The FR continued to operate its slate traffic, a workmen&#x27;s train on weekdays throughout the year and a summer tourist passenger service. Ordinary passenger services ceased on the FR on 15 September 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II. The workmen&#x27;s passenger service ran for the last time on Saturday, 16 September 1939. Slate trains were from then onwards operated three days each week but gravity operation was discontinued. Slate traffic ceased on 1 August 1946, apart from the section from Duffws to the North Western yard through Blaenau Ffestiniog town centre, which was leased on 7 October 1946 to the quarry owners. This provided the railway company, which retained the services of a resident manager at Porthmadog, with a small income throughout the moribund years.

The original act of Parliament which permitted the building of the line made no specific provision for its closure or abandonment. Although the main line had ceased functioning, the company could not dismantle the railway, so the track and infrastructure were left in place. An amending act of Parliament could have been sought to repeal the old one, but the company did not have the money. However, without maintenance, the line soon became overgrown and unusable.

===Restoration===
From 1949, various groups of rail enthusiasts attempted to revitalise the railway. In 1951, railway enthusiast Alan Pegler was approached by friends to buy and clear the outstanding debt on the derelict Ffestiniog Railway, to enable its purchase. Lent £3,000 by his father, he and the volunteers obtained control of the company on 24 June 1954. Pegler was appointed the new company&#x27;s first Chairman, with the objective to operate the railway as a tourist attraction and gradually restore the line to working order. The first meeting of the revivalists was held at a Bristol college on 8 September. Amongst the twelve in attendance were Allan Garraway, Harold Holcroft and Vic Mitchell. Mitchell would later be appointed a director of the company. Pegler later released complete control of the company without any personal financial gain to the Ffestiniog Railway Trust, which still owns and runs the railway today.

In 1954, the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) built the Ffestiniog Pumped Storage Scheme. This included a new reservoir, Llyn Ystradau which flooded a mile of the line north of the Moewlwyn Tunnel. In 1972, after the second-longest court case in British legal history, the Festiniog Railway Company obtained compensation for the loss of its route. Two years later, the case influenced the writing of the Land Compensation Act 1973.

On 18 August 1954, Colonel McMullen of the Ministry of Transport, Railways Inspectorate inspected the line from Blaenau Ffestiniog to Porthmadog, accompanied by Pegler, several directors and other supporters. Restoration began on 20 September 1954 when Morris Jones, the foreman fitter who had last worked for the railway in March 1947, rejoined the staff. Jones worked to complete the rebuilding of the locomotive &quot;Prince&quot; which he had been working on when the railway closed. He was joined at Boston Lodge works by two volunteers, Bill Harvey and Allan Garraway. The completion of sixty years service with the FR by Robert Evans (for almost 25 years as Manager) was marked on 6 November 1954 and a special train was run from Minffordd to Porthmadog to celebrate the occasion and convey Evans, his wife, Alan Pegler (Company Chairman) and guests en route to a clock presentation ceremony. Evans continued in service as Manager until his retirement on 1 June 1955 when Garraway was appointed as Manager.

The first public passenger train from Porthmadog to Boston Lodge ran on 23 July 1955. &quot;Prince&quot; returned to service on 3 August 1955. After extensive boiler repairs, Double Fairlie &quot;Taliesin&quot; returned to service on 4 September 1956. The passenger service was extended to Minffordd on 19 May 1956, to Penrhyn on 5 June 1957 and to Tan-y-Bwlch on 5 April 1958. Increasing traffic put severe demands on the track – over had been reopened in four years. A long period of consolidation, rolling stock restoration and track renewal followed before the extension to Dduallt on 6 April 1968. This extension was celebrated on 28 May 1968 by the re-introduction of the Ffestiniog Railway Letter Service.

===The Llyn Ystradau Deviation===
Between 1965 and 1978, the Ffestiniog Railway Deviation, a long diversionary route, was constructed between Dduallt and Tanygrisiau in order to avoid the Ffestiniog hydro-electric power station and its reservoir (Llyn Ystradau). The Deviation (this is the conventional name for such railway works) was built mostly by volunteers. At the southern end is the Dduallt spiral formation which is unique on a public railway in the United Kingdom. Including a bridge, it was constructed entirely by volunteers, and gains an initial height rise of in order (after a further of new volunteer-built railway and a new tunnel) to clear the flooded track bed north of the former Moelwyn tunnel, which is plugged near its usually-submerged northern end. Between Dduallt and the old tunnel, parts of the old railway formation can be clearly seen below the new route.

The new tunnel was constructed between 1975 and 1977 by three Cornish tin mining engineers with a small team of employees. It had to be blasted through a granite spur of the Moelwyn mountain. The tunnel plant included stone crushing and grading equipment, which produced track ballast and other aggregates from the spoil for use on the railway. Before it opened to rail traffic, the new tunnel had to be lined throughout its length with liquid cement reinforced with steel mesh in a process called &#x27;shotcreting&#x27;.

From 26 May 1975, and over two summers, a pull and push service, officially called &quot;The Shuttle&quot;, powered by diesel locomotive &quot;Moel Hebog&quot; with carriage 110, was operated from Dduallt to Gelliwiog, to enable tourists to experience the Deviation route before the new Moelwyn Tunnel was opened.

North of the new tunnel is a long stretch of track along the west bank of the new reservoir. On 25 June 1977, full-length passenger trains first ran from Dduallt through the new tunnel to a now-dismantled temporary terminus known as &quot;Llyn Ystradau&quot;. That station was alongside Llyn Ystradau but, because it was on Central Electricity Generating Board land without public access, passengers could not leave the station other than by train.

The remaining section included some specialised engineering work at its summit () where the new line passes over the power station pipelines. This was followed by two public road crossings with automatic signalling, on the FR&#x27;s only reverse or down gradient, to rejoin the old route in Tanygrisiau station (), which was reopened on 24 June 1978.

The largely volunteer group building the Deviation was officially called the Civil Engineering Group, but its members were popularly known (and are still remembered) as the &quot;Deviationists&quot;, who completed an enormous task over 13 years.

===Project Blaenau===

The completion of the railway through to Tanygrisiau (height ) left the FR with just to go to its goal of Blaenau Ffestiniog (height ) but the complexities of reconstructing that unique but rather derelict urban section of narrow-gauge railway took a further four years. As well as of new track and its formation, which was the responsibility of the FR permanent way department and its volunteers, much other work needed to be done. Most of the work, like the deviation itself, was undertaken by volunteers who, in many cases, assumed full responsibility for the design as well as the execution of discrete projects, each under a volunteer project leader. There were four decrepit footbridges each needing to be demolished and rebuilt to the new FR loading gauge. The decrepit steel bridge across the Afon Barlwyd required total replacement, with timber (Karri) beams using the original abutments and piers. The new deck is formed of old rails. Walls and fences throughout had to be repaired or replaced. These and the many other varied tasks formed Project Blaenau.

One major task near Tanygrisiau was the responsibility of Gwynedd County Council, which had at some time after 1955 taken advantage of the absence of trains to demolish what was probably Britain&#x27;s lowest road under railway bridge. In early 1980, therefore, they replaced Dolrhedyn bridge and even managed to give it a few inches extra headroom for road vehicles.

Civil engineering contractors were employed in conjunction with British Rail and Gwynedd County Council for the new route with its bridges and roadworks and the new joint station on the former Great Western Railway station site. British Rail commenced using the new station on 22 March 1982. Ffestiniog trains returned to Blaenau on Tuesday, 25 May 1982, thus marking the 150th Anniversary of royal assent to the Festiniog Railway Act 1832. The new joint station with British Rail at Blaenau Ffestiniog was officially opened on 30 April 1983 by George Thomas, Speaker of the House of Commons, who unveiled a plaque that records his visit.

With the major project of track restoration to Blaenau finally complete, attention could be turned to other matters. More Fairlie locomotives were built or restored and new carriages were built. At Minffordd, a new hostel was built for volunteers who support the permanent staff by working in every department of the railway. Stations were given new buildings, canopies and platforms, often replacing the previous temporary structures and improving the image of the railway for the future.

After fully reopening in 1982 and carrying 200,000 passengers annually, the railway became the second largest Welsh tourist attraction after Caernarfon Castle. Many saw this as the result of Pegler&#x27;s drive and ability to inspire others with his unquenchable enthusiasm to fulfil his dream. Pegler, who remained fully involved with the railway until his death in 2012 as President, was appointed OBE in the 2006 New Year Honours in recognition of his contribution.

===Welsh Highland Railway===

In 1988, the Festiniog Railway Company was involved in a controversial plan to stop the neighbouring Welsh Highland Railway (WHR) being rebuilt, as it was concerned at the effect a nearby heritage railway competitor could have on the FR business. The initial plan would have involved the FR Company buying the original track bed of the WHR from the old company&#x27;s receiver and giving it to Gwynedd County Council, provided no railway-related developments were allowed on the land. This was greeted with dismay by the WHR (1964) Company, which had been attempting to preserve the line since the 1960s.

This action may have delayed the start of rebuilding of the Welsh Highland Railway, although the alternative plan was dependent on the continued co-operation of Gwynedd County Council to ensure that the track bed was used solely for railway purposes. This was not guaranteed, as pressure from various groups who objected to the rebuilding of the railway was significant and it was the stated intention of the council to apply for an abandonment order on gaining the track bed. This would have left the track bed open for seizure by adverse possession (&#x27;squatters&#x27; rights&#x27;) by farmers, use in other ways such as footpaths, road improvement schemes etc., as the statutory designation of the track bed as a railway would have been discontinued. Over the years, the presence of plans for footpaths and roads had indeed made it difficult for anyone wishing to rebuild the line.

This led a group to form &#x27;Trackbed Consolidation Limited&#x27; (TCL) and, after some detective work, TCL managed to trace and purchase shares and debentures in the original WHR company. They felt that an alternative plan was available, one where the original company could be brought out of receivership. It was originally the intent of TCL to provide the track bed to the WHR (1964) Company to rebuild the line, but they refused the offer.

TCL were introduced to the FR and decided that the aims and objectives of TCL and the FR were similar thus, since 1988, the FR company has been totally committed to the reopening of the Welsh Highland Railway. All TCL-owned shares/debentures were transferred to the FR on the condition that they would be returned if the railway was not built.

The next few years were marked by protracted legal procedures before the assets of the old company could be transferred and before final consent to rebuild the railway was given. The first section from Caernarfon to Dinas, the Caernarfon Light Railway, was opened and operated by the FR from 11 October 1997. This section was not hampered by these extended legal procedures and was built as a Light Railway Order, as it was not part of the original Welsh Highland Railway route; the site of Dinas station had been sold off and thus was not part of the assets of the old WHR company. Other powers under a Transport &amp; Works Order enabled restoration to Waunfawr in 2000 and to Rhyd Ddu in 2003. Hafod y Llyn was reached in 2009 and Pont Croesor in 2010. By 2010, the tracks of the WHR and Ffestiniog Railway had been reconnected at Harbour Station, linking Caernarfon to Porthmadog and passenger services started in 2011.

The completed Welsh Highland Railway or &quot;Rheilffordd Eryri&quot; (its Welsh name) comprises parts of the former London and North Western Railway (1867), North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways (1877–81), Portmadoc, Beddgelert and South Snowdon Railway and Welsh Highland (1922-3) Railway. The FR also links with the WHR (Porthmadog) at Pen-y-Mount Station, north of Porthmadog.

=== Rails ===
Rails increased in weight and strength as traffic changed.
* 16 lb/yd original rails for horse drawn operation
* 30 lb/yd rails for early steam locomotive operation found to be too light.
* 48.66 lb/yd rails for later steam operation

==Tourism and heritage==

One of the earliest references to tourism is in the LNWR Tourist Guide for 1876, which waxed lyrical about the Ffestiniog Railway, which it illustrated with a drawing of a lady in Welsh National Dress (then still in regular local use) travelling on an FR up train (since many empty slate wagons – with two standing brakesmen – were attached at the rear) with the caption &quot;On the Ffestiniog Railway&quot;. The guide uses the &quot;double F&quot; spelling throughout. It was, however, in the inter-war years from 1919 to 1939 that tourism, though always valued, came to acquire a major importance.

Since restoration commenced in 1954, tourism has been the only significant source of income. The role of the Ffestiniog Railway in the promotion and fulfilment of tourism and in preserving railway heritage has been recognised many times, and notable mentions have included:
*1964 Wales Tourist Board certificate for conspicuous service to Welsh tourism.
*1972 Wales Tourist Board lists the FR as fifth most popular tourist site in Wales, after Caernarfon Castle, the Swallow Falls, the National Museum of Wales at Cardiff and Conwy Castle.
*1979 The FR was one of only six sites in Wales to receive the British Tourist Authority&#x27;s Golden Jubilee Award.
*1987 The FR was the outright winner of the Independent Railway of the Year award.
*2004 The &quot;Talking Train&quot; (an internal audio guide) was awarded the Heritage Railway Association &#x27;interpretation&#x27; Award.

Recognition of the railway&#x27;s importance to tourism and heritage has been increasingly marked by financial assistance given to the company towards capital expenditure. Prior to September 1987, the FR had received £1,273,127 in gifts and grants. Of this: £450,476 was Gifts from the FR Society and FR Trust and other supporters; £379,335 from Wales Tourist Board; £134,320 from EEC Grants and £308,996 from other public sources.

Major grants received subsequently have been: In 1989 a grant of £430,000 (£ in ), mainly from The EEC (National Programme of Community Interest for the promoting of tourism in Dyfed, Gwynedd and Powys); in 1995 a grant of £500,000 (£ in ), to promote work in Blaenau Ffestiniog
and in 1998 a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of £375,000 (£ in ), for the construction of workshops to facilitate the restoration of historic vehicles.

Today the railway is promoted as one of The Great Little Trains of Wales, a joint marketing scheme launched in 1970 that encompasses ten narrow-gauge railways in the country, mostly found in north and mid Wales.

== Rolling stock ==

==Stations and halts==
At Porthmadog, the original line came via the streets and across the Britannia bridge from the 1836 terminus at the northernmost end of the Welsh Slate Company&#x27;s Wharf where the FR officially started. This was the second datum point for all pre-1954 mileage calculations. (the first being in Blaenau Ffestiniog). The line over the bridge also connected with the Gorseddau and Croesor Tramways and was later used by Welsh Highland Railway passenger trains from 1923 to 1936. The line over the bridge was last used in 1958 and then dismantled. It was reopened as part of the WHR in 2011.

===The Cob ===
Between Porthmadog Harbour station and Boston Lodge, the railway runs on the Cob, the dyke of the Traeth Mawr polder. The Cob was built between 1807 and 1811 by William Madocks and, in addition to its land reclamation function in conjunction with sluice gates at the Britannia bridge, it serves also as a roadway (which, since 1836, has been at a lower level on the landward side) and as a bridge across the Afon Glaslyn. Tolls were charged with a tollgate at Boston Lodge until 2003, when the rights were purchased by the National Assembly for Wales.

The higher, original, section of the Cob carries, in addition to the railway, a public footpath throughout virtually its entire length. There is no fencing between the footpath and the railway, because the railway does not own the top of the Cob, but used a wayleave under the local act of Parliament, the Portmadoc Harbour Act 1821 (1 &amp; 2 Geo. 4. c.cxv) for improving Porthmadog Harbour. This act was repealed by the Porthmadog Harbour Revision Order 1998 (SI 1998/683) and is no longer in force.

== Quarries served by the railway ==

The Ffestiniog Railway was built primarily to connect the slate quarries in the mountains around what is now Blaenau Ffestiniog with the harbour at Porthmadog. In all at least 23 quarries were directly or indirectly connected to the railway, often by inclines. They sent their finished products over the railway in slate waggons to be transferred onto ships or, later, onto the standard-gauge railway at Minffordd.

==Train operation since 1955==

===Infrastructure===

As the line was extended, passing loops were brought into operation at Minffordd, Penrhyn and Tan-y-Bwlch. Due to the restrictions to the length of trains that could be passed at Penrhyn, Rhiw Goch was opened on 14 May 1975. Penrhyn loop remained in service for several more years before it was closed. By the end of the 1970s, the passing loops were at Minffordd, Rhiw Goch, Tan-y-Bwlch and Dduallt, and an intensive service was run in the peak summer seasons (although there were empty &quot;slots&quot; in the timetable which could be used by works trains). From the early 1980s, the peak summer timetable had three train sets in operation, generally passing at Rhiw Goch and Dduallt.

Automatic signalling was installed at Tan-y-Bwlch in 1986. By the 1988 season, in part due to the challenges in maintenance of the top end points at Dduallt and the planned automation of Minffordd, the loops at Dduallt and Rhiw Goch had been taken out of service for crossing trains. At the end of May 1988, Dduallt ceased to be a token station and Dduallt loop was taken out of service altogether and became a siding. Rhiw Goch ceased to be used except on odd occasions and was taken out of use as a means to cross passenger trains in 1989. The short section token instruments and the signal heads were removed, although the loop could still be used as a refuge for Engineers&#x27; trains. Minffordd and Tan-y-Bwlch therefore became the usual passing loops, both automated.

In the late 1990s, Rhiw Goch was recommissioned as a passing loop. From the 2005 season, the box has been regularly manned during the summer to provide additional operational flexibility. In 2006, an appeal was launched, through the FR Society, for funds to replace the life-expired signal box with a building of more traditional appearance. Fundraising went well and work was completed during the closed season of 2006/07.

Elsewhere, Tanygrisiau had been provided with a run-round loop whilst it had been the terminus between June 1978 and May 1982. This loop was removed when the line was reopened to Blaenau Ffestiniog. In the mid-1990s, a project was launched to install a fully signalled passing loop. This proceeded as a volunteer project, including the building of a signal box. However, prior to commissioning, the project was abandoned in 2001. The trackwork (apart for the siding off the Up Loop) remained in situ. In June 2002, the loop was once again used to run trains around as part of the 2002 Gala to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the restoration of services to Blaenau Ffestiniog. The intended platform starter signals (posts, brackets and arms) have been recovered and some are now in use on the Isle of Man Railway, whilst others are destined for the resignalling of Harbour Station. In 2004, with new disc starter signals and spring-loaded points installed, Tanygrisiau became a passing loop for the first time.

===Train control and regulation===
The Ffestiniog Railway operates on the electric token system (ETS) using a mixture of miniature and large train staffs, under the overall control of the duty controller based at Porthmadog.

Miniature train staffs are provided for:
* Porthmadog to Minffordd (Intermediate Instrument at Boston Lodge)
* Minffordd to Tanybwlch – Long Section (Intermediate Instrument at Rhiw Goch)
* Tanybwlch to Tanygrisiau (Intermediate Instrument at Dduallt)
* Tanygrisiau to Blaenau Ffestiniog (Intermediate Instrument at Glan-y-Pwll)

Large train staffs are provided for:
* Minffordd to Rhiw Goch – Short Section
* Rhiw Goch to Tanybwlch – Short Section

The Short Section train staffs are brought into service by opening Rhiw Goch Signalbox, hence trapping the Minffordd to Tanybwlch Long Section Miniature train staff in the lever frame, when the signal box is opened and manned by a signalman.

The signalling and ETS equipment is primarily designed for train crew operation. To obtain permission to withdraw a train staff to enter a single line section, Control has to be contacted.

The Control Office regulates train running, giving permission for trains to enter the single line sections, recording train movements on the Train Graph, ensuring trains are formed of an appropriate number of carriages (depending on the expected train loadings), acting as the single point of contact in the rare event of a failure occurring with rolling stock, and making station announcements at Porthmadog

The Control Office is also responsible for the Train Operation on the Welsh Highland Railway and it also regulates trains from the Welsh Highland Railway Limited, including the interface with the Network Rail ERTMS signaller (in Shrewsbury) to clear the WHR route where it crosses the main Cambrian Coast (standard gauge) line at grade between Pont Croesor and Porthmadog. This is the only mixed narrow/standard-gauge level crossing in the UK, and an interface between 19th and 21st century signalling systems.

==Preparation==
DMA was first reported in 1850 by the German chemist A. W. Hofmann, who prepared it by heating aniline and iodomethane:
:C6H5NH2 + 2 CH3I → C6H5N(CH3)2 + 2 HI 
DMA is produced industrially by alkylation of aniline with methanol in the presence of an acid catalyst:
:C6H5NH2 + 2 CH3OH → C6H5N(CH3)2 + 2 H2O
Similarly, it is also prepared using dimethyl ether as the methylating agent.
==Reactions==
Dimethylaniline undergoes many of the reactions expected for an aniline, being weakly basic and reactive toward electrophiles. 

It is nitrated to produce tetryl, a derivative with four nitro groups which was once used as explosive. In acidic solution, the initial nitration gives 3-nitrodimethylaniline. It reacts with butyllithium to give the 2-lithio derivative. Electrophilic methylating agents like dimethyl sulfate attack the amine to give the quaternary ammonium salt:
:C6H5N(CH3)2 +(CH3O)2SO2 → C6H5N(CH3)3CH3OSO3

Diethylaniline and dimethylaniline are both used as acid-absorbing bases.

==Applications==
DMA is a key precursor to commercially important triarylmethane dyes such as malachite green and crystal violet. DMA serves as a promoter in the curing of polyester and vinyl ester resins. DMA is also used as a precursor to other organic compounds. A study of the in vitro metabolism of &quot;N,N&quot;-dimethylaniline using guinea pig and rabbit preparations and GLC techniques has confirmed &quot;N&quot;-demethylation and &quot;N&quot;-oxidation as metabolic pathways, and has also established ring hydroxylation as a metabolic route.

<doc id="213607" wikidata="Q2530956" url="?curid=213607" title="History of the telescope">
<text>The history of the telescope can be traced to before the invention of the earliest known telescope, which appeared in 1608 in the Netherlands, when a patent was submitted by Hans Lippershey, an eyeglass maker. Although Lippershey did not receive his patent, news of the invention soon spread across Europe. The design of these early refracting telescopes consisted of a convex objective lens and a concave eyepiece. Galileo improved on this design the following year and applied it to astronomy. In 1611, Johannes Kepler described how a far more useful telescope could be made with a convex objective lens and a convex eyepiece lens. By 1655, astronomers such as Christiaan Huygens were building powerful but unwieldy Keplerian telescopes with compound eyepieces.

Isaac Newton is credited with building the first reflector in 1668 with a design that incorporated a small flat diagonal mirror to reflect the light to an eyepiece mounted on the side of the telescope. Laurent Cassegrain in 1672 described the design of a reflector with a small convex secondary mirror to reflect light through a central hole in the main mirror.

The achromatic lens, which greatly reduced color aberrations in objective lenses and allowed for shorter and more functional telescopes, first appeared in a 1733 telescope made by Chester Moore Hall, who did not publicize it. John Dollond learned of Hall&#x27;s invention and began producing telescopes using it in commercial quantities, starting in 1758.

Important developments in reflecting telescopes were John Hadley&#x27;s production of larger paraboloidal mirrors in 1721; the process of silvering glass mirrors introduced by Léon Foucault in 1857; and the adoption of long-lasting aluminized coatings on reflector mirrors in 1932. The Ritchey-Chretien variant of Cassegrain reflector was invented around 1910, but not widely adopted until after 1950; many modern telescopes including the Hubble Space Telescope use this design, which gives a wider field of view than a classic Cassegrain.

During the period 1850–1900, reflectors suffered from problems with speculum metal mirrors, and a considerable number of &quot;Great Refractors&quot; were built from 60 cm to 1 metre aperture, culminating in the Yerkes Observatory refractor in 1897; however, starting from the early 1900s a series of ever-larger reflectors with glass mirrors were built, including the Mount Wilson 60-inch (1.5 metre), the 100-inch (2.5 metre) Hooker Telescope (1917) and the 200-inch (5 metre) Hale Telescope (1948); essentially all major research telescopes since 1900 have been reflectors. A number of 4-metre class (160 inch) telescopes were built on superior higher altitude sites including Hawaii and the Chilean desert in the 1975–1985 era. The development of the computer-controlled alt-azimuth mount in the 1970s and active optics in the 1980s enabled a new generation of even larger telescopes, starting with the 10-metre (400 inch) Keck telescopes in 1993/1996, and a number of 8-metre telescopes including the ESO Very Large Telescope, Gemini Observatory and Subaru Telescope.

The era of radio telescopes (along with radio astronomy) was born with Karl Guthe Jansky&#x27;s serendipitous discovery of an astronomical radio source in 1931. Many types of telescopes were developed in the 20th century for a wide range of wavelengths from radio to gamma-rays. The development of space observatories after 1960 allowed access
to several bands impossible to observe from the ground, including X-rays and longer wavelength infrared bands.

== Optical telescopes ==
=== Optical foundations ===


Objects resembling lenses date back 4000 years although it is unknown if they were used for their optical properties or just as decoration.
Greek accounts of the optical properties of water-filled spheres (5th century BC) were followed by many centuries of writings on optics, including Ptolemy (2nd century) in his &quot;Optics&quot;, who wrote about the properties of light including reflection, refraction, and color, followed by Ibn Sahl (10th century) and Ibn Al-Haytham (11th century).

Actual use of lenses dates back to the widespread manufacture and use of eyeglasses in Northern Italy beginning in the late 13th century. The invention of the use of concave lenses to correct near-sightedness is ascribed to Nicholas of Cusa in 1451.

===Invention===
The first record of a telescope comes from the Netherlands in 1608. It is in a patent filed by Middelburg spectacle-maker Hans Lippershey with the States General of the Netherlands on 2 October 1608 for his instrument &quot;for seeing things far away as if they were nearby.&quot; A few weeks later another Dutch instrument-maker, Jacob Metius also applied for a patent. The States General did not award a patent since the knowledge of the device already seemed to be ubiquitous but the Dutch government awarded Lippershey with a contract for copies of his design.

The original Dutch telescopes were composed of a convex and a concave lens—telescopes that are constructed this way do not invert the image. Lippershey&#x27;s original design had only 3x magnification. Telescopes seem to have been made in the Netherlands in considerable numbers soon after this date of &quot;invention&quot;, and rapidly found their way all over Europe.

==== Claims of prior invention ====
In 1655, the Dutch diplomat William de Boreel tried to solve the mystery of who invented the telescope. He had a local magistrate in Middelburg follow-up on Boreel&#x27;s childhood and early adult recollections of a spectacle-maker named &quot;Hans&quot;, who he remembered as the inventor of the telescope. The magistrate was contacted by a then-unknown claimant– the Middelburg spectacle-maker Johannes Zachariassen, who testified that his father– Zacharias Janssen, invented the telescope and the microscope as early as 1590. This testimony seemed convincing to Boreel, who now recollected that Zacharias and his father– Hans Martens, must have been who he remembered. Boreel&#x27;s conclusion that Zacharias Janssen invented the telescope a little ahead of another spectacle maker, Hans Lippershey, was adopted by Pierre Borel in his 1656 book &quot;De vero telescopii inventore&quot;. Discrepancies in Boreel&#x27;s investigation and Zachariassen&#x27;s testimony (including Zachariassen misrepresenting his date of birth and role in the invention) has led some historians to consider this claim dubious. The &quot;Janssen&quot; claim would continue over the years and be added on to with Zacharias Snijder in 1841 presenting 4 iron tubes with lenses in them claimed to be 1590 examples of Janssen&#x27;s telescope and historian Cornelis de Waard&#x27;s 1906 claim that the man who tried to sell a broken telescope to astronomer Simon Marius at the 1608 Frankfurt Book Fair must have been Janssen.

In 1682, the minutes of the Royal Society in London Robert Hooke noted Thomas Digges&#x27; 1571 &quot;Pantometria&quot;, (a book on measurement, partially based on his father Leonard Digges&#x27; notes and observations) seemed to support an English claim to the invention of the telescope, describing Leonard as having a &quot;fare seeing glass&quot; in the mid-1500s based on an idea by Roger Bacon. Thomas described it as &quot;&quot;by proportional Glasses duly situate in convenient angles, not only discovered things far off, read letters, numbered pieces of money with the very coin and superscription thereof, cast by some of his friends of purpose upon downs in open fields, but also seven miles off declared what hath been done at that instant in private places&quot;.&quot; Comments on the use of proportional or &quot;perspective glass&quot; are also made in the writings of John Dee (1575) and William Bourne (1585). Bourne was asked in 1580 to investigate the Diggs device by Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s chief advisor Lord Burghley. Bourne&#x27;s is the best description of it, and from his writing it seemed to consist of peering into a large curved mirror that reflected the image produced by a large lens. The idea of an &quot;Elizabethan Telescope&quot; has been expanded over the years, including astronomer and historian Colin Ronan concluding in the 1990s that this reflecting/refracting telescope was built by Leonard Digges between 1540 and 1559. This &quot;backwards&quot; reflecting telescope would have been unwieldy; it needed very large mirrors and lens to work; the observer had to stand backwards to look at an upside down view, and Bourne noted that it had a very narrow field of view, making it unsuitable for military purposes. The optical performance required to see the details of coins lying about in fields, or private activities seven miles away, seems to be far beyond the technology of the time, and it may be that the &quot;perspective glass&quot; being described was a far simpler idea, originating with Bacon, of using a single lens held in front of the eye to magnify a distant view.

A 1959 research paper by Simon de Guilleuma claimed that evidence he had uncovered pointed to the French born spectacle maker Juan Roget (died before 1624) as another possible builder of an early telescope that predated Hans Lippershey&#x27;s patent application.

In 2022, the Italian professor of physics Alessandro Bettini published a paper on whether Leonardo da Vinci could have invented a telescope. Building upon 1939 observations by Domenico Argentieri of what look like lenses arranged like a telescope in da Vinci drawings, Bettini superimposed Argentieri&#x27;s lens arrangement on an adjacent drawing of diverging rays, coming up with an arrangement that also looked like a telescope. Bettini also noted the writings of Italian scholar and professor Girolamo Fracastoro in 1538, about combining lenses in eyeglasses to make the &quot;moon or at another star&quot; &quot;so near that they would appear not higher than the towers&quot;.

==== Spread of the invention ====
Lippershey&#x27;s application for a patent was mentioned at the end of a diplomatic report on an embassy to Holland from the Kingdom of Siam sent by the Siamese king Ekathotsarot: &quot;Ambassades du Roy de Siam envoyé à l&#x27;Excellence du Prince Maurice, arrivé à La Haye le 10 Septemb. 1608&quot; (&quot;Embassy of the King of Siam sent to his Excellency Prince Maurice, arrived at The Hague on 10 September 1608&quot;). This report was issued in October 1608 and distributed across Europe, leading to experiments by other scientists, such as the Italian Paolo Sarpi, who received the report in November, and the English mathematician and astronomer Thomas Harriot, who used a six-powered telescope by the summer of 1609 to observe features on the moon.

The Italian polymath Galileo Galilei was in Venice in June 1609 and there heard of the &quot;Dutch perspective glass&quot;, a military spyglass, by means of which distant objects appeared nearer and larger. Galileo states that he solved the problem of the construction of a telescope the first night after his return to Padua from Venice and made his first telescope the next day by using a convex objective lens in one extremity of a leaden tube and a concave eyepiece lens in the other end, an arrangement that came to be called a Galilean telescope. A few days afterwards, having succeeded in making a better telescope than the first, he took it to Venice where he communicated the details of his invention to the public and presented the instrument itself to the doge Leonardo Donato, who was sitting in full council. The senate in return settled him for life in his lectureship at Padua and doubled his salary.

Galileo set himself to improving the telescope, producing telescopes of increased magnification. His first telescope had a 3x magnification, but he soon made instruments which magnified 8x, and finally, one nearly a meter long with a 37mm objective (which he would stop down to 16mm or 12mm) and a 23x magnification. With this last instrument, he began a series of astronomical observations in October or November of 1609, observing the satellites of Jupiter, hills and valleys on the moon, the phases of Venus and spots on the sun (using the projection method rather than direct observation). Galileo noted that the revolution of the satellites of Jupiter, the phases of Venus, rotation of the sun and the tilted path its spots followed for part of the year pointed to the validity of the sun-centered Copernican system over other Earth-centered systems such as the one proposed by Ptolemy.

Galileo&#x27;s instrument was the first to be given the name &quot;telescope&quot;. The name was invented by the Greek poet/theologian Giovanni Demisiani at a banquet held on April 14, 1611, by Prince Federico Cesi to make Galileo Galilei a member of the . The word was created from the Greek &quot;tele&quot; = &#x27;far&#x27; and &quot;skopein&quot; = &#x27;to look or see&#x27;; &quot;teleskopos&quot; = &#x27;far-seeing&#x27;.

By 1626 knowledge of the telescope had spread to China when German Jesuit and astronomer Johann Adam Schall von Bell published &quot;Yuan jing shuo&quot;, (遠鏡說, &quot;Explanation of the Telescope&quot;) in Chinese and Latin.

=== Further refinements ===
==== Refracting telescopes ====
Johannes Kepler first explained the theory and some of the practical advantages of a telescope constructed of two convex lenses in his &quot;Catoptrics&quot; (1611). The first person who actually constructed a telescope of this form was the Jesuit Christoph Scheiner who gives a description of it in his &quot;Rosa Ursina&quot; (1630).

William Gascoigne was the first who commanded a chief advantage of the form of telescope suggested by Kepler: that a small material object could be placed at the common focal plane of the objective and the eyepiece. This led to his invention of the micrometer, and his application of telescopic sights to precision astronomical instruments. It was not until about the middle of the 17th century that Kepler&#x27;s telescope came into general use: not so much because of the advantages pointed out by Gascoigne, but because its field of view was much larger than in the Galilean telescope.

The first powerful telescopes of Keplerian construction were made by Christiaan Huygens after much labor—in which his brother assisted him. With one of these: an objective diameter of and a focal length, he discovered the brightest of Saturn&#x27;s satellites (Titan) in 1655; in 1659, he published his &quot;&quot;Systema Saturnium&quot; which, for the first time, gave a true explanation of Saturn&#x27;s ring—founded on observations made with the same instrument.

===== Long focal length refractors =====
The sharpness of the image in Kepler&#x27;s telescope was limited by the chromatic aberration introduced by the non-uniform refractive properties of the objective lens. The only way to overcome this limitation at high magnifying powers was to create objectives with very long focal lengths. Giovanni Cassini discovered Saturn&#x27;s fifth satellite (Rhea) in 1672 with a telescope long. Astronomers such as Johannes Hevelius were constructing telescopes with focal lengths as long as . Besides having really long tubes these telescopes needed scaffolding or long masts and cranes to hold them up. Their value as research tools was minimal since the telescope&#x27;s frame &quot;tube&quot; flexed and vibrated in the slightest breeze and sometimes collapsed altogether.

===== Aerial telescopes =====

In some of the very long refracting telescopes constructed after 1675, no tube was employed at all. The objective was mounted on a swiveling ball-joint on top of a pole, tree, or any available tall structure and aimed by means of string or connecting rod. The eyepiece was handheld or mounted on a stand at the focus, and the image was found by trial and error. These were consequently termed aerial telescopes. and have been attributed to Christiaan Huygens and his brother Constantijn Huygens, Jr. although it is not clear that they invented it. Christiaan Huygens and his brother made objectives up to diameter and focal length and others such as Adrien Auzout made telescopes with focal lengths up to . Telescopes of such great length were naturally difficult to use and must have taxed to the utmost the skill and patience of the observers. Aerial telescopes were employed by several other astronomers. Cassini discovered Saturn&#x27;s third and fourth satellites in 1684 with aerial telescope objectives made by Giuseppe Campani that were in focal length.

==== Reflecting telescopes ====
The ability of a curved mirror to form an image may have been known since the time of Euclid and had been extensively studied by Alhazen in the 11th century. Galileo, Giovanni Francesco Sagredo, and others, spurred on by their knowledge that curved mirrors had similar properties to lenses, discussed the idea of building a telescope using a mirror as the image forming objective. Niccolò Zucchi, an Italian Jesuit astronomer and physicist, wrote in his book &quot;Optica philosophia&quot; of 1652 that he tried replacing the lens of a refracting telescope with a bronze concave mirror in 1616. Zucchi tried looking into the mirror with a hand held concave lens but did not get a satisfactory image, possibly due to the poor quality of the mirror, the angle it was tilted at, or the fact that his head partially obstructed the image.

In 1636 Marin Mersenne proposed a telescope consisting of a paraboloidal primary mirror and a paraboloidal secondary mirror bouncing the image through a hole in the primary, solving the problem of viewing the image. James Gregory went into further detail in his book &quot;Optica Promota&quot; (1663), pointing out that a reflecting telescope with a mirror that was shaped like the part of a conic section, would correct spherical aberration as well as the chromatic aberration seen in refractors. The design he came up with bears his name: the &quot;Gregorian telescope&quot;; but according to his own confession, Gregory had no practical skill and he could find no optician capable of realizing his ideas and after some fruitless attempts, was obliged to abandon all hope of bringing his telescope into practical use.

In 1666 Isaac Newton, based on his theories of refraction and color, perceived that the faults of the refracting telescope were due more to a lens&#x27;s varying refraction of light of different colors than to a lens&#x27;s imperfect shape. He concluded that light could not be refracted through a lens without causing chromatic aberrations, although he incorrectly concluded from some rough experiments that &quot;all&quot; refracting substances would diverge the prismatic colors in a constant proportion to their mean refraction. From these experiments Newton concluded that no improvement could be made in the refracting telescope. Newton&#x27;s experiments with mirrors showed that they did not suffer from the chromatic errors of lenses, for all colors of light the angle of incidence reflected in a mirror was equal to the angle of reflection, so as a proof to his theories Newton set out to build a reflecting telescope. Newton completed his first telescope in 1668 and it is the earliest known functional reflecting telescope. After much experiment, he chose an alloy (speculum metal) of tin and copper as the most suitable material for his objective mirror. He later devised means for grinding and polishing them, but chose a spherical shape for his mirror instead of a parabola to simplify construction. He added to his reflector what is the hallmark of the design of a &quot;Newtonian telescope&quot;, a secondary &quot;diagonal&quot; mirror near the primary mirror&#x27;s focus to reflect the image at 90° angle to an eyepiece mounted on the side of the telescope. This unique addition allowed the image to be viewed with minimal obstruction of the objective mirror. He also made all the tube, mount, and fittings. Newton&#x27;s first compact reflecting telescope had a mirror diameter of 1.3 inches and a focal ratio of f/5. With it he found that he could see the four Galilean moons of Jupiter and the crescent phase of the planet Venus. Encouraged by this success, he made a second telescope with a magnifying power of 38x which he presented to the Royal Society of London in December 1671. This type of telescope is still called a Newtonian telescope.

A third form of reflecting telescope, the &quot;Cassegrain reflector&quot; was devised in 1672 by Laurent Cassegrain. The telescope had a small convex hyperboloidal secondary mirror placed near the prime focus to reflect light through a central hole in the main mirror.

No further practical advance appears to have been made in the design or construction of the reflecting telescopes for another 50 years until John Hadley (best known as the inventor of the octant) developed ways to make precision aspheric and parabolic speculum metal mirrors. In 1721 he showed the first parabolic Newtonian reflector to the Royal Society. It had a diameter, focal length speculum metal objective mirror. The instrument was examined by James Pound and James Bradley. After remarking that Newton&#x27;s telescope had lain neglected for fifty years, they stated that Hadley had sufficiently shown that the invention did not consist in bare theory. They compared its performance with that of a diameter aerial telescope originally presented to the Royal Society by Constantijn Huygens, Jr. and found that Hadley&#x27;s reflector, &quot;will bear such a charge as to make it magnify the object as many times as the latter with its due charge&quot;, and that it represents objects as distinct, though not altogether so clear and bright.

Bradley and Samuel Molyneux, having been instructed by Hadley in his methods of polishing speculum metal, succeeded in producing large reflecting telescopes of their own, one of which had a focal length of . These methods of fabricating mirrors were passed on by Molyneux to two London opticians —Scarlet and Hearn— who started a business manufacturing telescopes.

The British mathematician, optician James Short began experimenting with building telescopes based on Gregory&#x27;s designs in the 1730s. He first tried making his mirrors out of glass as suggested by Gregory, but he later switched to speculum metal mirrors creating Gregorian telescopes with original designers parabolic and elliptic figures. Short then adopted telescope-making as his profession which he practised first in Edinburgh, and afterward in London. All Short&#x27;s telescopes were of the Gregorian form. Short died in London in 1768, having made a considerable fortune selling telescopes.

Since speculum metal mirror secondaries or diagonal mirrors greatly reduced the light that reached the eyepiece, several reflecting telescope designers tried to do away with them. In 1762 Mikhail Lomonosov presented a reflecting telescope before the Russian Academy of Sciences forum. It had its primary mirror tilted at four degrees to telescope&#x27;s axis so the image could be viewed via an eyepiece mounted at the front of the telescope tube without the observer&#x27;s head blocking the incoming light. This innovation was not published until 1827, so this type came to be called the Herschelian telescope after a similar design by William Herschel.
About the year 1774 William Herschel (then a teacher of music in Bath, England) began to occupy his leisure hours with the construction of reflector telescope mirrors, finally devoted himself entirely to their construction and use in astronomical research. In 1778, he selected a reflector mirror (the best of some 400 telescope mirrors which he had made) and with it, built a focal length telescope. Using this telescope, he made his early brilliant astronomical discoveries. In 1783, Herschel completed a reflector of approximately in diameter and focal length. He observed the heavens with this telescope for some twenty years, replacing the mirror several times. In 1789 Herschel finished building his largest reflecting telescope with a mirror of and a focal length of , (commonly known as his 40-foot telescope) at his new home, at Observatory House in Slough, England. To cut down on the light loss from the poor reflectivity of the speculum mirrors of that day, Herschel eliminated the small diagonal mirror from his design and tilted his primary mirror so he could view the formed image directly. This design has come to be called the Herschelian telescope. He discovered Saturn&#x27;s sixth known moon, Enceladus, the first night he used it (August 28, 1789), and on September 17, its seventh known moon, Mimas. This telescope was world&#x27;s largest telescope for over 50 years. However, this large scope was difficult to handle and thus less used than his favorite 18.7-inch reflector.

In 1845 William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse built his Newtonian reflector called the &quot;Leviathan of Parsonstown&quot; with which he discovered the spiral form of galaxies.

All of these larger reflectors suffered from the poor reflectivity and fast tarnishing nature of their speculum metal mirrors. This meant they need more than one mirror per telescope since mirrors had to be frequently removed and re-polished. This was time-consuming since the polishing process could change the curve of the mirror, so it usually had to be &quot;re-figured&quot; to the correct shape.

==== Achromatic refracting telescopes ====

From the time of the invention of the first refracting telescopes it was generally supposed that chromatic errors seen in lenses simply arose from errors in the spherical figure of their surfaces. Opticians tried to construct lenses of varying forms of curvature to correct these errors. Isaac Newton discovered in 1666 that chromatic colors actually arose from the un-even refraction of light as it passed through the glass medium. This led opticians to experiment with lenses constructed of more than one type of glass in an attempt to canceling the errors produced by each type of glass. It was hoped that this would create an &quot;achromatic lens&quot;; a lens that would focus all colors to a single point, and produce instruments of much shorter focal length.

The first person who succeeded in making a practical achromatic refracting telescope was Chester Moore Hall from Essex, England. He argued that the different humours of the human eye refract rays of light to produce an image on the retina which is free from color, and he reasonably argued that it might be possible to produce a like result by combining lenses composed of different refracting media. After devoting some time to the inquiry he found that by combining two lenses formed of different kinds of glass, he could make an achromatic lens where the effects of the unequal refractions of two colors of light (red and blue) was corrected. In 1733, he succeeded in constructing telescope lenses which exhibited much reduced chromatic aberration. One of his instruments had an objective measuring with a relatively short focal length of .

Hall was a man of independent means and seems to have been careless of fame; at least he took no trouble to communicate his invention to the world. At a trial in Westminster Hall about the patent rights granted to John Dollond (Watkin v. Dollond), Hall was admitted to be the first inventor of the achromatic telescope. However, it was ruled by Lord Mansfield that &quot;it was not the person who locked his invention in his scrutoire who ought to profit for such invention, but the one who brought it forth for the benefit of mankind.&quot;

In 1747, Leonhard Euler sent to the Prussian Academy of Sciences a paper in which he tried to prove the possibility of correcting both the chromatic and the spherical aberration of a lens. Like Gregory and Hall, he argued that since the various humours of the human eye were so combined as to produce a perfect image, it should be possible by suitable combinations of lenses of different refracting media to construct a perfect telescope objective. Adopting a hypothetical law of the dispersion of differently colored rays of light, he proved analytically the possibility of constructing an achromatic objective composed of lenses of glass and water.

All of Euler&#x27;s efforts to produce an actual objective of this construction were fruitless—a failure which he attributed solely to the difficulty of procuring lenses that worked precisely to the requisite curves. John Dollond agreed with the accuracy of Euler&#x27;s analysis, but disputed his hypothesis on the grounds that it was purely a theoretical assumption: that the theory was opposed to the results of Newton&#x27;s experiments on the refraction of light, and that it was impossible to determine a physical law from analytical reasoning alone.

In 1754, Euler sent to the Berlin Academy a further paper in which starting from the hypothesis that light consists of vibrations excited in an elastic fluid by luminous bodies—and that the difference of color of light is due to the greater or lesser frequency of these vibrations in a given time— he deduced his previous results. He did not doubt the accuracy of Newton&#x27;s experiments quoted by Dollond.

Dollond did not reply to this, but soon afterwards he received an abstract of a paper by the Swedish mathematician and astronomer, Samuel Klingenstierna, which led him to doubt the accuracy of the results deduced by Newton on the dispersion of refracted light. Klingenstierna showed from purely geometrical considerations (fully appreciated by Dollond) that the results of Newton&#x27;s experiments could not be brought into harmony with other universally accepted facts of refraction.

As a practical man, Dollond at once put his doubts to the test of experiment: he confirmed the conclusions of Klingenstierna, discovered a difference far beyond his hopes in the refractive qualities of different kinds of glass with respect to the divergence of colors, and was thus rapidly led to the construction of lenses in which first the chromatic aberration—and afterwards—the spherical aberration were corrected.

Dollond was aware of the conditions necessary for the attainment of achromatism in refracting telescopes, but relied on the accuracy of experiments made by Newton. His writings show that with the exception of his bravado, he would have arrived sooner at a discovery for which his mind was fully prepared. Dollond&#x27;s paper recounts the successive steps by which he arrived at his discovery independently of Hall&#x27;s earlier invention—and the logical processes by which these steps were suggested to his mind.

In 1765 Peter Dollond (son of John Dollond) introduced the triple objective, which consisted of a combination of two convex lenses of crown glass with a concave flint lens between them. He made many telescopes of this kind.

The difficulty of procuring disks of glass (especially of flint glass) of suitable purity and homogeneity limited the diameter and light gathering power of the lenses found in the achromatic telescope. It was in vain that the French Academy of Sciences offered prizes for large perfect disks of optical flint glass.

The difficulties with the impractical metal mirrors of reflecting telescopes led to the construction of large refracting telescopes. By 1866 refracting telescopes had reached in aperture with many larger &quot;Great refractors&quot; being built in the mid to late 19th century. In 1897, the refractor reached its maximum practical limit in a research telescope with the construction of the Yerkes Observatorys&#x27; refractor (although a larger refractor Great Paris Exhibition Telescope of 1900 with an objective of diameter was temporarily exhibited at the Paris 1900 Exposition). No larger refractors could be built because of gravity&#x27;s effect on the lens. Since a lens can only be held in place by its edge, the center of a large lens will sag due to gravity, distorting the image it produces.

=== Large reflecting telescopes ===

In 1856–57, Karl August von Steinheil and Léon Foucault introduced a process of depositing a layer of silver on glass telescope mirrors. The silver layer was not only much more reflective and longer lasting than the finish on speculum mirrors, it had the advantage of being able to be removed and re-deposited without changing the shape of the glass substrate. Towards the end of the 19th century very large silver on glass mirror reflecting telescopes were built.

The beginning of the 20th century saw construction of the first of the &quot;modern&quot; large research reflectors, designed for precision photographic imaging and located at remote high altitude clear sky locations such as the 60-inch Hale Telescope of 1908, and the Hooker telescope in 1917, both located at Mount Wilson Observatory. These and other telescopes of this size had to have provisions to allow for the removal of their main mirrors for re-silvering every few months. John Donavan Strong, a young physicist at the California Institute of Technology, developed a technique for coating a mirror with a much longer lasting aluminum coating using thermal vacuum evaporation. In 1932, he became the first person to &quot;aluminize&quot; a mirror; three years later the and telescopes became the first large astronomical telescopes to have their mirrors aluminized. 1948 saw the completion of the Hale reflector at Mount Palomar which was the largest telescope in the world up until the completion of the massive BTA-6 in Russia twenty-seven years later. The Hale reflector introduced several technical innovations used in future telescopes, including hydrostatic bearings for very low friction, the Serrurier truss for equal deflections of the two mirrors as the tube sags under gravity, and the use of Pyrex low-expansion glass for the mirrors. The arrival of substantially larger telescopes had to await the introduction of methods other than the rigidity of glass to maintain the proper shape of the mirror.

==== Active and adaptive optics ====
The 1980s saw the introduction of two new technologies for building larger telescopes and improving image quality,
known as active optics and adaptive optics. In active optics, an image analyser senses the aberrations of a star image
a few times per minute, and a computer adjusts many support forces on the primary mirror and the location of the secondary mirror
to maintain the optics in optimal shape and alignment. This is too slow to correct for atmospheric blurring effects, but enables the use of thin single mirrors up to 8 m diameter, or even larger segmented mirrors. This method was pioneered by the ESO New Technology Telescope in the late 1980s.

The 1990s saw a new generation of giant telescopes appear using active optics, beginning with the construction of the first of the two Keck telescopes in 1993. Other giant telescopes built since then include: the two Gemini telescopes, the four separate telescopes of the Very Large Telescope, and the Large Binocular Telescope.

Adaptive optics uses a similar principle, but applying corrections several hundred times per second to
compensate the effects of rapidly changing optical distortion due to the motion of turbulence in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Adaptive optics works by measuring the distortions in a wavefront and then compensating for them by rapid changes of actuators applied to a small deformable mirror or with a liquid crystal array filter. AO was first envisioned by Horace W. Babcock in 1953, but did not come into common usage in astronomical telescopes until advances in computer and detector technology during the 1990s made it possible to calculate the compensation needed in real time. In adaptive optics, the high-speed corrections needed mean that a fairly bright star is needed very close to the target of interest (or an artificial star is created by a laser). Also, with a single star or laser the corrections are only effective over a very narrow field (tens of arcsec), and current systems operating on several 8-10m telescopes work mainly in near-infrared wavelengths for single-object observations.

Developments of adaptive optics include systems with multiple lasers over a wider corrected field, and/or working above kiloHertz rates for good correction at visible wavelengths; these are currently in progress but not yet in routine operation as of 2015.

== Other wavelengths ==
The twentieth century saw the construction of telescopes which could produce images using wavelengths other than visible light starting in 1931 when Karl Jansky discovered astronomical objects gave off radio emissions; this prompted a new era of observational astronomy after World War II, with telescopes being developed for other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum from radio to gamma-rays.

=== Radio telescopes ===

Radio astronomy began in 1931 when Karl Jansky discovered that the Milky Way was a source of radio emission while doing research on terrestrial static with a direction antenna. Building on Jansky&#x27;s work, Grote Reber built a more sophisticated purpose-built radio telescope in 1937, with a dish; using this, he discovered various unexplained radio sources in the sky. Interest in radio astronomy grew after the Second World War when much larger dishes were built including: the Jodrell bank telescope (1957), the Green Bank Telescope (1962), and the Effelsberg telescope (1971). The huge Arecibo telescope (1963) was so large that it was fixed into a natural depression in the ground; the central antenna could be steered to allow the telescope to study objects up to twenty degrees from the zenith. However, not every radio telescope is of the dish type. For example, the Mills Cross Telescope (1954) was an early example of an array which used two perpendicular lines of antennae in length to survey the sky.

High-energy radio waves are known as microwaves and this has been an important area of astronomy ever since the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964. Many ground-based radio telescopes can study microwaves. Short wavelength microwaves are best studied from space because water vapor (even at high altitudes) strongly weakens the signal. The Cosmic Background Explorer (1989) revolutionized the study of the microwave background radiation.

Because radio telescopes have low resolution, they were the first instruments to use interferometry allowing two or more widely separated instruments to simultaneously observe the same source. Very long baseline interferometry extended the technique over thousands of kilometers and allowed resolutions down to a few milli-arcseconds.

A telescope like the Large Millimeter Telescope (active since 2006) observes from , bridging between the far-infrared/submillimeter telescopes and longer wavelength radio telescopes including the microwave band from about to in wavelength.

=== Infrared telescopes (700 nm/ 0.7 μm – 1000 μm/1 mm) ===

Although most infrared radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere, infrared astronomy at certain wavelengths can be conducted on high mountains where there is little absorption by atmospheric water vapor. Ever since suitable detectors became available, most optical telescopes at high-altitudes have been able to image at infrared wavelengths. Some telescopes such as the UKIRT, and the IRTF — both on Mauna Kea — are dedicated infrared telescopes. The launch of the IRAS satellite in 1983 revolutionized infrared astronomy from space. This reflecting telescope which had a mirror, operated for nine months until its supply of coolant (liquid helium) ran out. It surveyed the entire sky detecting 245,000 infrared sources—more than 100 times the number previously known.

=== Ultra-violet telescopes (10 nm – 400 nm) ===

Although optical telescopes can image the near ultraviolet, the ozone layer in the stratosphere absorbs ultraviolet radiation shorter than 300 nm so most ultra-violet astronomy is conducted with satellites. Ultraviolet telescopes resemble optical telescopes, but conventional aluminium-coated mirrors cannot be used and alternative coatings such as magnesium fluoride or lithium fluoride are used instead. The Orbiting Solar Observatory satellite carried out observations in the ultra-violet as early as 1962. The International Ultraviolet Explorer (1978) systematically surveyed the sky for eighteen years, using a aperture telescope with two spectroscopes. Extreme-ultraviolet astronomy (10–100 nm) is a discipline in its own right and involves many of the techniques of X-ray astronomy; the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (1992) was a satellite operating at these wavelengths.

=== X-ray telescopes (0.01 nm – 10 nm) ===

X-rays from space do not reach Earth&#x27;s surface, so X-ray astronomy must be conducted above Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The first X-ray experiments were conducted on sub-orbital rocket flights, which enabled the first detection of X-rays from the sun (1948), and then from the first galactic X-ray sources: Scorpius X-1 (June 1962) and the Crab Nebula (October 1962). Since then, X-ray telescopes (Wolter telescopes) have been built using nested grazing-incidence mirrors which deflect X-rays to a detector. Some of the OAO satellites conducted X-ray astronomy in the late 1960s, but the first dedicated X-ray satellite was the Uhuru (1970) which discovered 300 sources. More recent X-ray satellites include: the EXOSAT (1983), ROSAT (1990), Chandra (1999), and Newton (1999).

=== Gamma-ray telescopes (less than 0.01 nm) ===

Gamma rays are absorbed high in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, so most gamma-ray astronomy is conducted with satellites. Gamma-ray telescopes use scintillation counters, spark chambers and more recently, solid-state detectors. The angular resolution of these devices is typically very poor. There were balloon-borne experiments in the early 1960s, but gamma-ray astronomy really began with the launch of the OSO 3 satellite in 1967; the first dedicated gamma-ray satellites were SAS B (1972) and Cos B (1975). The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (1991) was a big improvement on previous surveys. Very high-energy gamma-rays (above 200 GeV) can be detected from the ground via the Cerenkov radiation that is produced by the passage of the gamma-rays through Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Several Cerenkov imaging telescopes have been built around the world, including: the HEGRA (1987), STACEE (2001), HESS (2003), and MAGIC (2004).

== Interferometric telescopes ==
In 1868, Fizeau noted that the purpose of the arrangement of mirrors or glass lenses in a conventional telescope was simply to provide an approximation to a Fourier transform of the optical wave field entering the telescope. As this mathematical transformation was well understood and could be performed mathematically on paper, he noted that by using an array of small instruments it would be possible to measure the diameter of a star with the same precision as a single telescope which was as large as the whole array— a technique which later became known as astronomical interferometry. It was not until 1891 that Albert A. Michelson successfully used this technique for the measurement of astronomical angular diameters: the diameters of Jupiter&#x27;s satellites (Michelson 1891). Thirty years later, a direct interferometric measurement of a stellar diameter was finally realized by Michelson &amp; Francis G. Pease (1921) which was applied by their 20 ft (6.1 m) interferometer mounted on the 100 inch Hooker Telescope on Mount Wilson.

The next major development came in 1946, when Martin Ryle and Derek Vonberg located a number of new cosmic radio sources by constructing a radio analogue of the Michelson interferometer. The signals from two radio antennas were added electronically to produce interference. Ryle and Vonberg&#x27;s telescope used Earth&#x27;s rotation to scan the sky in one dimension. With the development of larger arrays and of computers which could rapidly perform the necessary Fourier transforms, the first aperture synthesis imaging instruments were soon developed which could obtain high resolution images without the need of a giant parabolic reflector to perform the Fourier transform. This technique is now used in most radio astronomy observations. Radio astronomers soon developed the mathematical methods to perform aperture synthesis Fourier imaging using much larger arrays of telescopes —often spread across more than one continent. In the 1980s, the aperture synthesis technique was extended to visible light as well as infrared astronomy, providing the first very high resolution optical and infrared images of nearby stars.

In 1995, this imaging technique was demonstrated on an array of separate optical telescopes for the first time, allowing a further improvement in resolution, and also allowing even higher resolution imaging of stellar surfaces. The same techniques have now been applied at a number of other astronomical telescope arrays including: the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer, the CHARA array, and the IOTA array.

In 2008, Max Tegmark and Matias Zaldarriaga proposed a &quot;Fast Fourier Transform Telescope&quot; design in which the lenses and mirrors could be dispensed with altogether when computers become fast enough to perform all the necessary transforms.

<text>Fractional distillation is the separation of a mixture into its component parts, or fractions. Chemical compounds are separated by heating them to a temperature at which one or more fractions of the mixture will vaporize. It uses distillation to fractionate. Generally the component parts have boiling points that differ by less than 25 °C (45 °F) from each other under a pressure of one atmosphere. If the difference in boiling points is greater than 25 °C, a simple distillation is typically used. 

A crude oil distillation unit uses fractional distillation in the process of refining crude oil.

==History==

The fractional distillation of organic substances played an important role in the 9th-century works attributed to the Islamic alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan, as for example in the  (&#x27;The Book of Seventy&#x27;), translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona (c. 1114–1187) under the title . The Jabirian experiments with fractional distillation of animal and vegetable substances, and to a lesser degree also of mineral substances, formed the main topic of the , an originally Arabic work falsely attributed to Avicenna that was translated into Latin and would go on to form the most important alchemical source for Roger Bacon ().

==Laboratory setup==

Fractional distillation in a laboratory makes use of common laboratory glassware and apparatuses, typically including a Bunsen burner, a round-bottomed flask and a condenser, as well as the single-purpose fractionating column.

As an example, consider the distillation of a mixture of water and ethanol. Ethanol boils at while water boils at . So, by heating the mixture, the most volatile component (ethanol) will concentrate to a greater degree in the vapor leaving the liquid. Some mixtures form azeotropes, where the mixture boils at a lower temperature than either component. In this example, a mixture of ethanol and water boils at ; the mixture is more volatile than pure ethanol. For this reason, ethanol cannot be completely purified by direct fractional distillation of ethanol–water mixtures.

The apparatus is assembled as in the diagram. (The diagram represents a batch apparatus as opposed to a continuous apparatus.) The mixture is put into the round-bottomed flask along with a few anti-bumping granules (or a Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer bar if using magnetic stirring), and the fractionating column is fitted into the top. The fractional distillation column is set up with the heat source at the bottom of the still pot. As the distance from the still pot increases, a temperature gradient is formed in the column; it is coolest at the top and hottest at the bottom. As the mixed vapor ascends the temperature gradient, some of the vapor condenses and vaporizes along the temperature gradient. Each time the vapor condenses and vaporizes, the composition of the more volatile component in the vapor increases. This distills the vapor along the length of the column, and eventually, the vapor is composed solely of the more volatile component (or an azeotrope). The vapor condenses on the glass platforms, known as trays, inside the column, and runs back down into the liquid below, refluxing distillate. The efficiency in terms of the amount of heating and time required to get fractionation can be improved by insulating the outside of the column in an insulator such as wool, aluminum foil, or preferably a vacuum jacket. The hottest tray is at the bottom and the coolest is at the top. At steady-state conditions, the vapor and liquid on each tray are at &quot;equilibrium&quot;. The most volatile component of the mixture exits as a gas at the top of the column. The vapor at the top of the column then passes into the condenser, which cools it down until it liquefies. The separation is more pure with the addition of more trays (to a practical limitation of heat, flow, etc.) Initially, the condensate will be close to the azeotropic composition, but when much of the ethanol has been drawn off, the condensate becomes gradually richer in water. The process continues until all the ethanol boils out of the mixture. This point can be recognized by the sharp rise in temperature shown on the thermometer.

The above explanation reflects the theoretical way fractionation works. Normal laboratory fractionation columns will be simple glass tubes (often vacuum-jacketed, and sometimes internally silvered) filled with a packing, often small glass helices of diameter. Such a column can be calibrated by the distillation of a known mixture system to quantify the column in terms of number of theoretical trays. To improve fractionation the apparatus is set up to return condensate to the column by the use of some sort of reflux splitter (reflux wire, gago, Magnetic swinging bucket, etc.) – a typical careful fractionation would employ a reflux ratio of around 4:1 (4 parts returned condensate to 1 part condensate take off). 

In laboratory distillation, several types of condensers are commonly found. The Liebig condenser is simply a straight tube within a water jacket and is the simplest (and relatively least expensive) form of condenser. The Graham condenser is a spiral tube within a water jacket, and the Allihn condenser has a series of large and small constrictions on the inside tube, each increasing the surface area upon which the vapor constituents may condense.

Alternate set-ups may use a multi-outlet distillation receiver flask (referred to as a &quot;cow&quot; or &quot;pig&quot;) to connect three or four receiving flasks to the condenser. By turning the cow or pig, the distillates can be channeled into any chosen receiver. Because the receiver does not have to be removed and replaced during the distillation process, this type of apparatus is useful when distilling under an inert atmosphere for air-sensitive chemicals or at reduced pressure. A Perkin triangle is an alternative apparatus often used in these situations because it allows isolation of the receiver from the rest of the system, but does require removing and reattaching a single receiver for each fraction.

Vacuum distillation systems operate at reduced pressure, thereby lowering the boiling points of the materials. Anti-bumping granules, however, become ineffective at reduced pressures.

==Industrial distillation==

Fractional distillation is the most common form of separation technology used in petroleum refineries, petrochemical and chemical plants, natural gas processing and cryogenic air separation plants. In most cases, the distillation is operated at a continuous steady state. New feed is always being added to the distillation column and products are always being removed. Unless the process is disturbed due to changes in feed, heat, ambient temperature, or condensing, the amount of feed being added and the amount of product being removed are normally equal. This is known as continuous, steady-state fractional distillation.

Industrial distillation is typically performed in large, vertical cylindrical columns known as &quot;distillation or fractionation towers&quot; or &quot;distillation columns&quot; with diameters ranging from about and heights ranging from about or more. The distillation towers have liquid outlets at intervals up the column which allow for the withdrawal of different fractions or products having different boiling points or boiling ranges. By increasing the temperature of the product inside the columns, the different products are separated. The &quot;lightest&quot; products (those with the lowest boiling point) exit from the top of the columns and the &quot;heaviest&quot; products (those with the highest boiling point) exit from the bottom of the column.

For example, fractional distillation is used in oil refineries to separate crude oil into useful substances (or fractions) having different hydrocarbons of different boiling points. The crude oil fractions with higher boiling points:

* have more carbon atoms
* have higher molecular weights
* are less branched-chain alkanes
* are darker in color
* are more viscous
* are more difficult to ignite and to burn
Large-scale industrial towers use reflux to achieve a more complete separation of products. Reflux refers to the portion of the condensed overhead liquid product from a distillation or fractionation tower that is returned to the upper part of the tower as shown in the schematic diagram of a typical, large-scale industrial distillation tower. Inside the tower, the reflux liquid flowing downwards provides the cooling needed to condense the vapors flowing upwards, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the distillation tower. The more reflux is provided for a given number of theoretical plates, the better the tower&#x27;s separation of lower boiling materials from higher boiling materials. Alternatively, the more reflux provided for a given desired separation, the fewer theoretical plates are required.
Fractional distillation is also used in air separation, producing liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen, and highly concentrated argon. Distillation of chlorosilanes also enable the production of high-purity silicon for use as a semiconductor.

In industrial uses, sometimes a packing material is used in the column instead of trays, especially when low-pressure drops across the column are required, as when operating under vacuum. This packing material can either be random dumped packing ( wide) such as Raschig rings or structured sheet metal. Typical manufacturers are Koch, Sulzer, and other companies. Liquids tend to wet the surface of the packing and the vapors pass across this wetted surface, where mass transfer takes place. Unlike conventional tray distillation in which every tray represents a separate point of vapor liquid equilibrium the vapor-liquid equilibrium curve in a packed column is continuous. However, when modeling packed columns it is useful to compute several &quot;theoretical plates&quot; to denote the separation efficiency of the packed column concerning more traditional trays. Differently shaped packings have different surface areas and porosity. Both of these factors affect packing performance.

===Design of industrial distillation columns===

Design and operation of a distillation column depends on the feed and desired products. Given a simple, binary component feed, analytical methods such as the McCabe–Thiele method or the Fenske equation can be used. For a multi-component feed, simulation models are used both for design and operation.

Moreover, the efficiencies of the vapor-liquid contact devices (referred to as &quot;plates&quot; or &quot;trays&quot;) used in distillation columns are typically lower than that of a theoretical efficient equilibrium stage. Hence, a distillation column needs more plates than the number of theoretical vapor-liquid equilibrium stages.

Reflux refers to the portion of the condensed overhead product that is returned to the tower. The reflux flowing downwards provides the cooling required for condensing the vapors flowing upwards. The reflux ratio, which is the ratio of the (internal) reflux to the overhead product, is conversely related to the theoretical number of stages required for efficient separation of the distillation products.
Fractional distillation towers or columns are designed to achieve the required separation efficiently. The design of fractionation columns is normally made in two steps; a process design, followed by a mechanical design. The purpose of the process design is to calculate the number of required theoretical stages and stream flows including the reflux ratio, heat reflux, and other heat duties. The purpose of the mechanical design, on the other hand, is to select the tower internals, column diameter, and height. In most cases, the mechanical design of fractionation towers is not straightforward. For the efficient selection of tower internals and the accurate calculation of column height and diameter, many factors must be taken into account. Some of the factors involved in design calculations include feed load size and properties and the type of distillation column used.

The two major types of distillation columns used are tray and packing columns. Packing columns are normally used for smaller towers and loads that are corrosive or temperature-sensitive or for vacuum service where pressure drop is important. Tray columns, on the other hand, are used for larger columns with high liquid loads. They first appeared on the scene in the 1820s. In most oil refinery operations, tray columns are mainly used for the separation of petroleum fractions at different stages of oil refining.

In the oil refining industry, the design and operation of fractionation towers is still largely accomplished on an empirical basis. The calculations involved in the design of petroleum fractionation columns require in the usual practice the use of numerable charts, tables, and complex empirical equations. In recent years, however, a considerable amount of work has been done to develop efficient and reliable computer-aided design procedures for fractional distillation.

<doc id="213616" wikidata="Q838749" url="?curid=213616" title="Steller's jay">
<text>Steller&#x27;s jay (Cyanocitta stelleri) is a bird native to western North America and the mountains of Central America, closely related to the blue jay (&quot;C. cristata&quot;) found in eastern North America. It is the only crested jay west of the Rocky Mountains. It is also sometimes colloquially called a &quot;blue jay&quot; in the Pacific Northwest, but is distinct from the blue jay of eastern North America. The species inhabits pine-oak and coniferous forests.

==Taxonomy==
Steller&#x27;s jay was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the crows in the genus &quot;Corvus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Corvus stelleri&quot;. Gmelin based his account on &quot;Stellers crow&quot; that had been described in 1781 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his book &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. Latham had examined a specimen belonging to the naturalist Joseph Banks that had been collected in Nootka Sound, Vancouver Island off the Pacific coast of Canada. The specimen was one of the birds collected on Captain James Cook&#x27;s third voyage to the Pacific Ocean. During this voyage Cook visited Nootka Sound from 29 March until 26 Apr 1778. Steller&#x27;s jay is now placed with the blue jay in the genus &quot;Cyanocitta&quot; that was introduced in 1845 by the English ornithologist Hugh Strickland.

The bird is named after the German naturalist Georg Wilhelm Steller, the first European to record them, in 1741.

Thirteen subspecies are recognised:
==Description==
Steller&#x27;s jay is about long and weighs about . Steller&#x27;s jay shows a great deal of regional variation throughout its range. Blackish-brown-headed birds from the north gradually become bluer-headed farther south. Steller&#x27;s jay has a more slender bill and longer legs than the blue jay and, in northern populations, has a much more pronounced crest. It is also somewhat larger.

The head is blackish-brown, black, or dark blue, depending on the subspecies of the bird, with lighter streaks on the forehead. This dark coloring gives way from the shoulders and lower breast to silvery blue. The primaries and tail are a rich blue with darker barring. Birds in the eastern part of its range along the Great Divide have white markings on the head, especially over the eyes; birds further west have light blue markers and birds in the far west along the Pacific Coast have small, very faint, or no white or light markings at all.

==Phylogeny==
Steller&#x27;s jay (&quot;Cyanocitta stelleri&quot;) is one of two species in the genus &quot;Cyanocitta&quot;, the other species being the blue jay (&quot;Cyanocitta cristata&quot;); because the two species sometimes interbreed naturally where their ranges overlap in the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains, their status as distinct species has been contested. There are 18 subspecies of Steller&#x27;s jays ranging from Alaska to Nicaragua, with nine found north of Mexico, often with areas of low or non-existent presence of the species separating the subspecies. At least some of the variation in the species is due to different degrees of hybridization between Steller&#x27;s jays (&quot;C. stelleri&quot;) and blue jays (&quot;C. cristata&quot;).

The genus &quot;Cyanocitta&quot; is part of the passerine family Corvidae, which consists of the crows, ravens, rooks, jackdaws, jays, magpies, treepies, choughs, and nutcrackers.

==Habitat==
Steller&#x27;s jay occurs in most of the forested areas of western North America as far east as the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains from southern Alaska in the north to northern Nicaragua in the south completely replacing the blue jay prevalent on the rest of the continent in those areas. Its density is lower in the central Rocky Mountain region (Montana, Idaho, Wyoming and eastern Utah) plus the desert or scrubland areas of the Great Basin (e.g. Nevada, western Utah, southern Arizona and parts of California). Some hybridization with the blue jay in eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains, especially Colorado, has been reported. It is also found in Mexico occurring through the interior highlands in northwestern Mexico as well as patchy populations in the rest of Mexico. In the northern end of its range it appears to be spreading from coastal Southeast Alaska across the Coast Mountains into southern Yukon Territory.

Steller&#x27;s jay is also found in Mexico&#x27;s interior highlands from Chihuahua and Sonora in the northwest southward to Jalisco, as well as other patchy populations found throughout Mexico. It is also found in south-central Guatemala, northern El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua.

Although Steller&#x27;s jay primarily lives in coniferous forests, it can be found in other types of forests as well. They can be found from low to moderate elevations, and on rare occasions to as high as the tree line. Steller&#x27;s jays are common in residential and agricultural areas with nearby forests.

==Diet==
Steller&#x27;s jays are omnivores; their diet is about two-thirds plant matter and one-third animal matter. They gather food both from the ground and from trees. Steller&#x27;s jay&#x27;s diet includes a wide range of seeds, nuts, berries and other fruit. They also eat many types of invertebrates, small rodents, eggs, and nestlings such as those of the marbled murrelet. There are some accounts of them eating small reptiles, both snakes and lizards.

Acorns and conifer seeds are staples during the non-breeding season; these are often cached in the ground or in trees for later consumption. They exploit human-provided food sources, frequently scavenging picnics and campsites, where it competes with the Canada jay.

Steller&#x27;s jays will visit feeders and prefer black-oil sunflower seeds, white striped sunflower seeds, cracked corn, shelled raw peanuts, and are especially attracted to whole raw peanuts. Suet is also consumed but mostly in the winter season.

==Breeding==

Steller&#x27;s jays breed in monogamous pairs. The clutch is usually incubated entirely by the female for about 16 days. The male feeds the female during this time. Though they are known to be loud both day and night, during nesting they are quiet in order to not attract attention.

The nest is usually in a conifer, but is sometimes built in a hollow in a tree or beneath the awning of a house or other structure. Similar in construction to the blue jay&#x27;s nest, it tends to be a bit larger (), using a number of natural materials or scavenged trash, often mixed with mud. Between two and six eggs are laid during breeding season. The eggs are oval in shape with a somewhat glossy surface. The background colour of the egg shell tends to be pale variations of greenish-blue with brown- or olive-coloured speckles.

==Vocalizations==
Like other jays, Steller&#x27;s jay has numerous and variable vocalizations. One common call is a harsh &quot;SHACK-Sheck-sheck-sheck-sheck-sheck&quot; series; another &quot;skreeka! skreeka!&quot; call sounds almost exactly like an old-fashioned pump handle; yet another is a soft, breathy &quot;hoodle hoodle&quot; whistle. Its alarm call is a harsh, nasal &quot;wah&quot;. Some calls are sex-specific: females produce a rattling sound, while males make a high-pitched &quot;gleep gleep&quot;.

Steller&#x27;s jay is also a noted mimic: it can imitate the vocalizations of many species of birds, other animals, and sounds of non-animal origin. It often will imitate the calls from birds of prey such as the red-tailed hawk, red-shouldered hawk, and osprey as a warning of danger to others or territorial behavior, causing other birds to seek cover and flee feeding areas.

Steller&#x27;s jays have the ability to assess risk using different predator detection cues. They have many alarm calls that are dependent on their interaction between predator identity and cue type. When Steller&#x27;s jays see a sharp-shinned hawk, they stop foraging for the same length of time as if the hawk had been heard instead. In contrast, Steller&#x27;s jays exhibit a longer latency to return to feeding when northern goshawks are seen rather than heard. The difference in reactions suggests that a distinct risk assessment is conducted by Steller&#x27;s jays. Steller&#x27;s jays will then vary the production of their &quot;&quot;wah&quot;, &quot;wek&quot;&quot;, and mimic red-tailed hawk calls in response to different detection cues.

==Provincial bird==
Steller&#x27;s jay is the provincial bird of the Canadian province of British Columbia.

<text>Y&amp;T (originally known as Yesterday &amp; Today) is an American hard rock/heavy metal band that formed in Oakland, California; the classic lineup that recorded the first album was cemented in 1974. The band released two studio albums on London Records as Yesterday &amp; Today in the 1970s before shortening their name to Y&amp;T, after which they released several albums on A&amp;M Records beginning in 1981, and later on Geffen Records, Avex Records, and more. The band was originally co-managed by Herbie Herbert and Louis &quot;Lou&quot; Bramy. The band has sold over 4 million albums worldwide to date, output summarized as 18 albums, three greatest hits collections, and a boxed set.

==Biography==
===Early years (1972–1983)===
In 1972, Leonard Haze, Bob Gardner, and Wayne Stitzer formed an unnamed band in Oakland, California, that jammed only cover tunes when Dave Meniketti joined that same year as guitar player. Soon after, the band received a call for their first gig, but they needed a name. According to Meniketti and Haze, Haze chose the name of the album that was playing on his turntable at that moment – &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot; – a studio album by the Beatles. The first lineup – which only played covers of songs by other artists – consisted of Haze on drums, Stitzer on piano, Gardner on bass, and Meniketti on lead vocals and lead guitar. After Stitzer quit the group, Gardner switched from bass to rhythm guitar and piano, and Phil Kennemore was brought in to play bass. In 1973, Gardner left the group; he was replaced by Joey Alves in January 1974. This 1974 lineup change was when the band began writing original material.

The band performed shows with Journey and many other acts, including Queen; during a show as part of the latter&#x27;s &quot;Night at the Opera&quot; tour, Y&amp;T were seen by the president of London Records, and were subsequently signed to the label. London released the band&#x27;s first two studio albums, a self-titled debut and &quot;Struck Down&quot;, in 1976 and 1978, respectively. While finishing their second album, London disclosed they would be removing the rock genre from their label, and Meniketti has since commented that this essentially meant that the &quot;Struck Down&quot; album &quot;would go nowhere.&quot; The band continued to tour extensively, building up to headliners while they opened for bands such as Wild Cherry, Kiss, AC/DC, and more.

As Meniketti has said in numerous radio, television, and magazine interviews over the past five decades, it was the new record deal (&quot;which took forever&quot; [to secure]) in 1980 with A&amp;M Records that prompted the band to shorten their name to simply Y&amp;T, which was influenced by their encores where fans would chant, &quot;Y&amp;T, Y&amp;T, Y&amp;T.&quot;

The band&#x27;s first two studio albums under A&amp;M, &quot;Earthshaker&quot; (1981) and &quot;Black Tiger&quot; (1982), though critically acclaimed around the globe, did not gain mainstream exposure in America. Songs off these two albums still make up a significant part of the band&#x27;s live shows. &quot;Black Tiger&quot; was recorded at Ridge Farm, in Dorking, County of Surrey, England and produced by Max Norman. The classic Y&amp;T logo made its first appearance on the cover of this album. Part-way through recording &quot;Black Tiger&quot;, the band did their first shows outside the US—Netherlands followed by the UK.

By 1983, Y&amp;T had started to play larger venues such as arenas, stadiums, and amphitheaters across America and Europe with a variety of acts including AC/DC, Alice Cooper, Blackfoot, Dio, Iron Maiden, Marillion, Mötley Crüe, Ozzy Osbourne, Twisted Sister, and ZZ Top, garnering far more mainstream recognition in Europe and Japan than they did in their native United States. With their third A&amp;M release, &quot;Mean Streak&quot; (1983), radio airplay and exposure had increased in the US despite poor promotion from the record company.

===Commercial success and brief hiatus (1984–1991)===
Y&amp;T&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;In Rock We Trust&quot;, released in 1984, became the band&#x27;s highest-charting and selling album, reaching No. 46 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album produced Y&amp;T&#x27;s first big radio hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Runnin&#x27;&quot;. Dr Pepper acquired the rights to use &quot;She&#x27;s a Liar&quot; in a radio ad campaign. To date, &quot;In Rock We Trust&quot; has sold over 450,000 copies. This album was the only Y&amp;T album to chart in Canada, reaching No. 77 on the RPM chart. The label brought in writer Geoffrey Leib for the album, the first time an external writer had been used. The success of &quot;In Rock We Trust&quot;, which saw the band continuing to perform at arenas and stadiums (including opening for Rush and Dio on their tours for &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; and &quot;The Last in Line&quot; respectively, as well as shows with Whitesnake, Twisted Sister, Ratt, Dokken, and Night Ranger), and participating in the 1984 edition of Monsters of Rock at Donington Park in England, gave Y&amp;T better exposure than they&#x27;d had previously.

The band&#x27;s 1985 hit &quot;Summertime Girls&quot;, initially featured as the sole studio track on the band&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Open Fire&quot;, and later also featured on their seventh (studio) album &quot;Down for the Count&quot; released later the same year, became the band&#x27;s highest-charting hit to date, reaching No. 55 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 16 on the Mainstream Rock songs chart. It received airplay worldwide, played frequently in the &quot;Baywatch&quot; television series, featured in several feature films (including Real Genius), received heavy rotation on MTV as well as MTV&#x27;s top video playlists, and continues to get regular airplay today on classic rock radio stations throughout the United States. &quot;Down for the Count&quot; would be the band&#x27;s last album for A&amp;M, as the band grew increasingly frustrated with the lack of promotion from the label within the US. Despite successful tours with Mötley Crüe and Aerosmith, and the chart success of &quot;Summertime Girls&quot;, the label declined to release a follow-up single. On his recollection of &quot;Down for the Count&quot;, Meniketti said in an interview for Metal Express Radio: &quot;. . . it ended up being a sort of wasted record . . . it was out right when the record company didn&#x27;t care about us.&quot; In present day the band still play tracks from the album in their live shows.

In 1986, the band changed record labels to Geffen, and in that same year, Haze was fired for drug abuse issues (as Haze, band, and management discuss in the documentary &quot;Y&amp;T: On With the Show&quot;), and was replaced by Jimmy DeGrasso; decades later when interviewed for the documentary &quot;Y&amp;T: On With the Show&quot;, Haze said, &quot;I would&#x27;ve fired me, too.&quot;

In 1987, the eighth album &quot;Contagious&quot; was released. In 1989, Alves was fired for drug abuse and was replaced by Stef Burns. (DeGrasso and Burns later played together with Alice Cooper in the 1990s.) Y&amp;T&#x27;s next studio album &quot;Ten&quot; was released in 1990. The album features ballads such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid of the Dark&quot; (the first and only single from the album), &quot;Ten Lovers&quot;, and &quot;Come in from the Rain&quot;, together with a few straightforward hard rock songs, including &quot;Hard Times&quot;, &quot;City&quot;, &quot;Surrender&quot;, and &quot;Goin&#x27; Off the Deep End&quot;. According to Meniketti, the video for &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid of the Dark&quot; was probably the best video they ever made, but with the onset of grunge he never once saw it on MTV.

With the record company opting not to release any further singles from the &quot;Ten&quot; album, the band decided to do seven shows in California and take a break in 1991, concluding with the live album &quot;Yesterday &amp; Today Live&quot;. Shortly after the 1991 hiatus, Meniketti declined an opportunity to form a proposed &#x27;super group&#x27; with Peter Frampton.

===Resurgence (1995–present)===
In 1995, Y&amp;T resumed with the same lineup of Meniketti, Burns, Kennemore, and DeGrasso, releasing &quot;Musically Incorrect&quot; in 1995 and &quot;Endangered Species&quot; in 1997. The band performed sporadically during the mid-to-late 1990s. However, in 2001, Haze returned on drums. At the time, Burns was in three bands: Y&amp;T, Huey Lewis and the News, and Italy&#x27;s biggest rock star, Vasco Rossi; scheduling conflicts forced Burns to drop one of the three bands, and so in 2003 he left Y&amp;T. He was replaced by rhythm guitarist/backing vocalist, John Nymann, who was a childhood friend of the band, and who had previously toured on the &quot;In Rock We Trust&quot; tour as a background vocalist, as Rock the Robot, and he sang backing vocals on &quot;Down for the Count&quot;.

In 2003, Y&amp;T resumed touring the world. In 2006 as Haze&#x27;s drug abuse continued creating issues, he was asked to step down and was replaced by Mike Vanderhule on drums.

In 2009, Y&amp;T began writing their twelfth studio album, released in May 2010, titled &quot;Facemelter&quot; on their own label in the US. It was their first studio album in thirteen years (since 1997&#x27;s &quot;Endangered Species&quot;) and was consequently licensed to the Italian label Frontiers Records for the rest of the world.
In June 2010, Y&amp;T toured the world in support of &quot;Facemelter&quot;, performing the big European summer festivals, such as Sweden Rock, Download Festival at Donington Park, UK, and Hellfest in Clisson, France. During this world tour, bassist Kennemore experienced health issues; that summer, while on the US leg of the 2010 world tour, he was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. Upon receiving doctor&#x27;s orders to leave the tour and begin treatment, Kennemore urged Meniketti to find a replacement and continue touring.

In July 2010, the group enlisted Brad Lang, bass player from the band Jet Red, to step in and finish Y&amp;T&#x27;s tour promoting &quot;Facemelter&quot;, as Kennemore wanted the tour to carry on during his fight with cancer. On January 7, 2011, bassist Kennemore died at the age of 57 after a short battle with lung cancer. Kennemore and Meniketti had been the only constant members of the band since the original 1974 lineup. After Kennemore&#x27;s untimely passing, Lang filled continued in the bass position.
On October 19, 2013, in Bellagio, Italy, Stef Burns joined the band onstage for four songs (&quot;Black Tiger&quot;, &quot;Dirty Girl&quot;, &quot;Midnight In Tokyo&quot;, and &quot;Hurricane&quot;) in a reunion of sorts since Burns had been busy touring with Huey Lewis and the News and Vasco Rossi. This one-time reunion was well received by the fans, as one would expect.

In April 2016, Lang left the band to address his alcohol dependency issues; his last show with Y&amp;T was on April 2, 2016, at the Fillmore in San Francisco. Lang&#x27;s friend Aaron Leigh (Frank Hannon Band) stepped in, his first show on April 14 at the Canyon Club in Agoura Hills, CA. On June 29, 2016, Y&amp;T and Lang announced separately on their own Facebook pages that they had mutually and amicably parted ways, confirming that Leigh would remain as the band&#x27;s bassist.

Original drummer Haze died on September 11, 2016, at the age of 61 after a long battle with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Original rhythm guitarist Alves died on March 12, 2017, at the age of 63 from ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease. Alves&#x27; death left Meniketti as the last surviving member from the band&#x27;s original, classic lineup.

In January 2018, Y&amp;T released their first-ever acoustic EP titled &quot;Acoustic Classix Vol. 1&quot;. In June 2018, Meniketti said that the band might release more acoustic EPs in the future.

On November 26, 2019, the long-awaited, fan-backed (on Kickstarter) documentary &quot;On With The Show&quot; was released.&quot;

==Legacy==
&quot;Summertime Girls&quot; has been the band&#x27;s most widely recognized song, along with fan favorites such as &quot;&quot;Mean Streak&quot;, &quot;Contagious&quot;, &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, &quot;Forever&quot;&quot;. &quot;Summertime Girls&quot; appeared on the soundtrack to the 1985 film Real Genius as well as an episode of Season 1 of HBO&#x27;s Peacemaker (TV series).

Music videos for songs such as &quot;&quot;Summertime Girls&quot;, &quot;Mean Streak&quot;, &quot;Lipstick &amp; Leather&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Runnin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid of the Dark&quot;,&quot; and &quot;Contagious&quot; are still featured on VH1 Classic.

Y&amp;T&#x27;s 2010 music video for &quot;I&#x27;m Coming Home&quot; marks the band&#x27;s most-viewed video on YouTube with over 2 million views.

In the movie &quot;Anvil! The Story of Anvil&quot;, in the bonus feature interview Lars Ulrich of Metallica talks at length about seeing one of his favorite bands, Y&amp;T, for the first time at a club in Hollywood in December 1980. Ulrich credits Y&amp;T as the reason he decided to become a musician, saying: &quot;That was the turning point for me wanting to play music. . . . You could tell that they loved what they were doing.&quot;

<doc id="213620" wikidata="Q3976140" url="?curid=213620" title="Struck Down">
<text>Struck Down is the second studio album by American hard rock/heavy metal band Yesterday and Today, released in 1978. It was one of the last rock albums to be released by London Records.

The band would change their name to Y&amp;T for their next studio album, &quot;Earthshaker&quot;.

==Critical reception==

On its release, reviewers of &quot;Record World&quot; considered group &quot;completely self-contained&quot; and expressed an opinion that &quot;hard rockers and heavy metal enthusiasts should delight to &quot;I&#x27;m Lost&quot; and &quot;Struck Down&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; in its review of 15 July 1978 found the band on this album &quot;continues its emphasis on high energy rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll in the Van Halen tradition&quot;. In comparison with debut LP this one has more polished sound due to Robinson&#x27;s production. Reviewer concluded that &quot;the writing is also sharper and more on the lyrical side, delivered convincingly and instrumentally supported by pulsating guitar riffs&quot; and named among the best tracks the following: &quot;Struck Down&quot;, &quot;Tried to Show You&quot;, &quot;Pleasure in My Heart&quot; and &quot;Dreams of Egypt&quot;.

<doc id="213625" wikidata="Q57452" url="?curid=213625" title="François Bozizé">
<text>François Bozizé Yangouvonda (born 14 October 1946) is a Central African politician who was President of the Central African Republic from 2003 to 2013. He was the only Central African president born in modern-day Gabon.

Bozizé rose to become a high-ranking army officer in the 1970s, under the rule of Jean-Bédel Bokassa. After Bokassa was ousted, Bozizé served in the government as Minister of Defense from 1979 to 1981 and as Minister of Information from 1981 to 1982. He participated in a failed 1982 coup attempt against President André Kolingba and subsequently fled the country. Years later, he served as Army Chief of Staff under President Ange-Félix Patassé, but began a rebellion against Patassé in 2001.

Bozizé&#x27;s forces captured the capital, Bangui, in March 2003, while Patassé was outside the country, and Bozizé took power, ushering in a transitional period of government. He won the March–May 2005 presidential election in a second round of voting, and was re-elected in the January 2011 presidential election, winning the vote in the first round.

In December 2012, the CAR was plunged into an uprising by rebel forces who condemned the Bozizé government for not honoring peace agreements after the Central African Republic Bush War in 2007. On 24 March 2013, Bozizé fled to Cameroon via the Democratic Republic of the Congo after the rebel forces attacked Bangui and took control of the presidential palace. There, he was housed by Paul Biya, president of Cameroon. On 29 May 2013, an international arrest warrant was issued against Bozizé by the Central African Republic.

==Early life and Kolingba&#x27;s rule==
Bozizé was born in the present-day nation of Gabon, a member of the Gbaya people, and attended a military officers&#x27; training college in the Central African province of Bouar. He became a second lieutenant in 1969 and a captain in 1975. He was appointed Brigadier General by the Emperor of Central Africa Bokassa I (Jean-Bédel Bokassa) in 1978, after he beat a French noncommissioned officer who had been disrespectful to the Emperor. With General Josyhat Mayomokala, Bozizé ordered military personnel to attack young demonstrators who were asking for their parents&#x27; arrears. After Bokassa was ousted by David Dacko in 1979, Bozizé was appointed Minister of Defense after an operation that the French army used to overthrow Bokassa (Operation Barracuda). 

Following Dacko&#x27;s ouster by André Kolingba in September 1981, Bozizé was appointed Minister of Information, but fled to the north of the country with 100 soldiers after his involvement in a failed coup attempt led by Ange-Félix Patassé on 3 March 1982, in which he accused Kolingba of treason and proclaimed the change of power on Radio Bangui. He then obtained refuge in France. During much of the 1980s, he also lived in Benin, where he became a devout follower of the Celestial Church of Christ. Bozizé was arrested in Cotonou in July 1989, and imprisoned and tortured. He was put on trial by Kolingba on charges of helping the coup d&#x27;état in May but was acquitted on 24 September 1991 and released from prison on 1 December. He then sought refuge in France, where he remained for nearly two years.

Under pressure to democratize the government during the 1980s, Kolingba had formed a political party and held a referendum, in which he was elected to a six-year term in office as president. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, internal and external pressures eventually forced Kolingba to adopt the beginnings of a democratic approach. In March 1991, he named Édouard Frank Prime Minister but allowed him virtually no power. He also established a commission to revise the constitution in order to promote pluralism.
As a result, the donor community severely restricted aid flows pending movement towards democracy putting the country into a vicious cycle in which it could not obtain the resources to pay for an election which would legitimize it sufficiently to obtain a flow of aid. When he was pressured by the international community, via a group of locally represented international donors called GIBAFOR (France, USA, Germany, Japan, EU, World Bank and UN), including a very vocal and eloquent US ambassador to the Central African Republic, Daniel H. Simpson, to hold fair elections. They were assisted by the UN Electoral Assistance Unit and monitored by international observers in 1992 but a lot of the resources came from France. Kolingba had the 1992 election sabotaged as he discovered he was not expected to win the vote and so declared the election invalid getting the Constitutional Council cancel it. Under continued pressure from the donor group the election was rescheduled for September 1993.

In the 1993 election, Bozizé ran for the presidency as an independent, receiving 12,159 votes, 1.5% of the total votes cast. 
Patassé, Abel Goumba and Kolingba received 37.32%, 21.68% and 12.10% of the vote, respectively, but since none of the candidates obtained a majority, a run-off election between the top two candidates — Patassé and Goumba — was held. Patassé defeated Goumba by a 53.49%–46.51% vote and was elected president of the Central African Republic.

==Relations with Patassé==
For many years Bozizé was considered a supporter of Patassé and helped him suppress army mutinies in 1996 and 1997. Bozizé was named the Armed Forces Chief of Staff. Bozizé showed no activity against Patassé and frequently crushed revolts against the president.

On 28 May 2001, a coup was attempted against Patassé and defeated with the help of Libyan troops and Congolese rebels of the Movement for the Liberation of Congo. Afterwards, Bozizé&#x27;s loyalty was questioned, and in late October 2001 he was dismissed as Army Chief of Staff. Fighting erupted when the government tried to arrest Bozizé on 3 November; after five days of this, government forces aided by Libyan troops captured the barracks where Bozizé was based, and Bozizé fled north to Chad.

Fighting between government forces and Bozizé&#x27;s rebels continued during 2002. From 25 to 31 October, his forces unsuccessfully attacked the capital, Bangui; soldiers of the Congolese MLC, which again came to Patassé&#x27;s aid, were accused of looting and rape.

This period was marked by tensions between Chad and Patassé&#x27;s government. Patassé&#x27;s ruling party accused Chadian president Idriss Déby of destabilizing the Central African Republic by supporting Bozizé with men and equipment.

==2003 Coup d’etat and Presidency==

On 15 March 2003, Bozizé finally succeeded in seizing power, with his forces entering Bangui unopposed. Patassé was returning from a meeting in Niger at the time, but could not land because Bozizé&#x27;s forces controlled the airport. Patassé took refuge in Cameroon and then Togo the next year.

On 23 March, Bozizé appointed Abel Goumba as prime minister. In December, he made Goumba Vice-President and appointed Célestin Gaombalet in his place as prime minister. Bozizé suspended the country&#x27;s 1995 constitution after seizing power, and a new constitution, reportedly similar to the old one, was approved by voters in a referendum on 5 December 2004. After seizing power, Bozizé initially said he would not run in a planned future presidential election, but after the successful constitutional referendum, he announced his intention to stand as a candidate on 11 December:

:After thinking thoroughly, and being deeply convinced and keeping in mind the nation&#x27;s interest, I grasped the deep sense of my people&#x27;s calls. As a citizen, I&#x27;ll take my responsibility.

:I&#x27;ll contest the election to achieve the task of rebuilding the country, which is dear to me and according to your wish.
In December 2004, a constitution was approved in a referendum which would allow a semi presidential system and a two term limit.

That same month on 30 December 2004, Bozizé was one of five candidates approved to run in the presidential election scheduled for early 2005. On 4 January 2005, Bozizé announced that three initially excluded candidates would also be allowed to run, although former president Patassé was not included in either group. In late January, it was announced that more candidates would be permitted to run in the election, bringing the total to 11 and leaving only Patassé barred. The elections were also delayed by one month from the previously scheduled date of 13 February to 13 March.

Bozizé placed first in the 13 March election, taking just under 43% of the vote according to official results. He faced Patassé&#x27;s last prime minister, Martin Ziguélé, in a second round of voting; this was held on 8 May and according to official results announced on 24 May, he won with 64.6% of the vote. He was sworn in on 11 June.

The National Assembly authorized Bozizé to rule by decree for three months, from 1 January to 31 March 2006; his prime minister, Élie Doté, said that this period of rule by decree was successful, enabling Bozizé to take measures to streamline the civil service.

In addition to being president, Bozizé has been Minister of National Defense since taking power. At the end of the transitional period, he retained the defense portfolio when he appointed a new government under Doté in June 2005, and he also kept it in a September 2006 cabinet reshuffle.

In early 2006, Bozizé&#x27;s government appeared stable. However, Patassé, who was living in exile in Togo, could not be ruled out as a leader of a future uprising. His supporters reportedly were joining or were prepared to join rebel movements in belief that their leader was still the rightful head of state of the country. Further, members of Kolingba&#x27;s Yakoma tribe in the south posed a potential threat to Bozizé&#x27;s government because of their widespread boycott of the second round of the legislative elections. Members of the Yakoma dominate the army. On 13 April 2007, a peace agreement between the government and the UFDR was signed in Birao. The agreement provided for an amnesty for the UFDR, its recognition as a political party, and the integration of its fighters into the army. Further negotiations resulted in an agreement in 2008 for reconciliation, a unity government, and local elections in 2009 and parliamentary and presidential elections in 2010. The new unity government that resulted was formed in January 2009.

Facing a general strike over wage arrears for civil servants in January 2008, Bozizé appointed a new government headed by Faustin-Archange Touadéra, an academic figure who was politically unknown. In that government he kept the defense portfolio, while also appointing his son Francis Bozizé to work under him as Minister-Delegate. Bozizé&#x27;s sister, Yvonne M&#x27;Boïssona, who had been Minister of Tourism, was reappointed to the government as Minister of Water, Forests, Hunting, Fishing, and the Environment. His nephew, Sylvain Ndoutingai, served as Minister of State of Mines, Energy, and Water Resources.

In February 2010, Kolingba died in France. In early March, Bozizé presided over his burial ceremony in Bangui. The same week, Bozizé signed a presidential decree setting the date for the next presidential election which was to be held on 25 April 2010.

The elections were first postponed to 16 May, and then indefinitely. The parliament was asked to pass a change to the constitution allowing the President to continue its mandate until elections could be organized. Some sources saw the delay in elections as a constitutional coup, and did not expect elections to take place anytime soon. However, elections were held in January and March 2011. Bozizé and his party both won in the elections.

In December 2010, Bozizé issued a decree which officially rehabilitated Bokassa, stating the former military dictator had &quot;given a great deal for humanity&quot;.

=== Central African Bush War ===
Shortly after Bozizé seized power, the Central African Republic Bush War began with the rebellion by the Union of Democratic Forces for Unity (UFDR), led by Michel Djotodia. This quickly escalated into major fighting during 2004. The UFDR rebel forces consisted of five allies, the &quot;Groupe d&#x27;action patriotique pour la liberation de Centrafrique&quot; (GAPLC), the Convention of Patriots for Justice and Peace (CPJP), the People&#x27;s Army for the Restoration of Democracy (APRD), the Movement of Central African Liberators for Justice (MLCJ), and the &quot;Front démocratique Centrafricain&quot; (FDC).

On 17 April 2004, security forces reportedly killed eight &quot;Liberators,&quot; Chadian combatants who had helped the President seize power in 2003. Prior to the killings, the Chadian combatants had staged violent demonstrations, looted approximately 75 homes in a Bangui suburb, and demanded payment from President Bozize for their support during the rebellion that allowed him to depose former President Patasse. During the year, the President reportedly paid each Liberator $1,000 (504,000 CFA francs) before they ostensibly returned to Chad.

During the first year, many parts of the country, and the Government was significantly affected by insecurity and the threat of conflict. In April 2004, the Government deployed 200 soldiers to fight banditry in the northern and northwest provinces, including Kemo and Ouham-Pende. Some human rights observers said they believed that many of the armed groups were the same rebels and mercenaries, including Chadian ex-combatants, who helped Bozize seize power in the 2003 coup; these observers said that because Bozize had been unable to pay the ex-combatants.

Between 2006 and 2007 President Francois Bozize was holding a national dialogue with rebel groups and political foes to try to end the fighting. He has signed peace pacts with two rebel groups but instability was rising.

Further negotiations resulted in an agreement in 2008 for reconciliation, a unity government and local elections in 2009 and parliamentary and presidential elections in 2010.

During this war many were killed,houses burnt, villages destroyed and many others such as no drinking water. Around 10,000 people were displaced because of the civil unrest.

Bozizé was instrumental in creating the Anti-balaka militias that would later proceed to carry out massacres against mainly Muslim citizens.

=== Corruption under Bozizé ===
Even though the Central African Republic has many minerals and an abundance of arable land, many of its inhabitants live in poverty. Male life expectancy went down during Bozizé&#x27;s presidency. In 2009, the CAR had a GDP per capita of just 456$. This was tied to corruption which further increased under Bozizé&#x27;s rule, as well as diamond smuggling.

After his deposal, Bozizé was implied in a major corruption case (in which the French politician Patrick Balkany was also implied as a negotiator): he had taken millions in bribes, real estate and luxury cars in exchange for the exploits of the French multinational mining company Areva in Bakouma.

=== Foreign relations ===
* - After Bozizé took power, he and Chadian president Idriss Déby (who had already been accused of involvement in the 2003 coup) went on to establish a strong political relationship, aiming to &quot;prevent closer cooperation between rebel groups on both sides of the border&quot;. In April 2006, Chadian rebels named the United Front for Democratic Change that were based in Darfur used the CAR as a route to attack Chad. Bozizé responded by closing the border between Sudan and Central African Republic.
* - Since 1998, France had had no military presence in the CAR. After the ascent of Bozizé, the military ties with France were restored by sending the Foreign Legion general Jean-Pierre Pérez - who was also connected to the private military company EHC - to be Bozizé&#x27;s counseller.

=== Religious policy ===
Bozizé, a follower of the West African Celestial Church of Christ, had already been accused by Patassé of using the church as a &quot;recruitment arm&quot; for his rebellion prior to the 2003 coup. He became the evangelical church&#x27;s main leader in the CAR in May 2012.

According to anthropologist Sandra Fancello, Bozizé&#x27;s presidency was marked by a &quot;warrior rhetoric&quot; that could be traced to the influence of the Celestial Church. He employed belligerent language against Muslims and other religious or political &quot;enemies&quot;, which furthered the stigmatization of the Central African Muslim community. Certain factions of the Anti-balaka were also connected to the Celestial Church.

==Civil War leadership==

On 10 December 2012, the Séléka CPSK-CPJP-UFDR (&quot;Séléka&quot; means &quot;coalition&quot;) seized the towns of N&#x27;Délé, Sam Ouandja and Ouadda. Rebels fought with government and allied CPJP troops for over an hour before securing the town of N&#x27;Délé. On 27 December, Bozizé requested international assistance to help with the rebellion, in particular from France and the United States. French President François Hollande rejected the plea, saying that the 250 French troops stationed at Bangui M&#x27;Poko International Airport are there &quot;in no way to intervene in the internal affairs&quot;.

On 11 January 2013, a ceasefire agreement was signed in Libreville, Gabon. The rebels dropped their demand for Bozizé to resign, but he had to appoint a new prime minister from the opposition party by 18 January 2013. On 13 January, Bozizé signed a decree that removed Prime Minister Touadéra from power, as part of the agreement with the rebel coalition. On 17 January, Nicolas Tiangaye was appointed prime minister.
By 22 March, however, the rebels had renewed their advance, accusing Bozizé of failing to honor the January ceasefire agreement. They took towns throughout the Central African Republic, including Damara and Bossangoa. They advanced to within 22 kilometers of Bangui, but were halted with an aerial assault from an attack helicopter. However, Nelson N&#x27;Djadder, presumed spokesman for the rebels, claimed that they shot down the helicopter.

On 24 March, rebel forces heavily attacked Bangui and took control of major structures, including the presidential palace. Bozizé&#x27;s family fled across the river to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and then to Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, where he was granted temporary refuge. Subsequently, he requested that Benin grant him political asylum.

== Exile and elections ==
Bozizé was forced to flee the country after being overthrown by Djotodia in a coup d’etat in 2013. While in exile, Bozizé fled to Cameroon via the Democratic Republic of the Congo after the rebel forces attacked Bangui and took control of the presidential palace. There, he was housed by Paul Biya, president of Cameroon. A warrant was placed for him and was transmitted on May 30, 2013. Bozize was accused of a string of arrests, abductions and arbitrary detentions as well as the destruction of nearly 4,000 homes.

Kwa Na Kwa announced on 10 August 2015 that Bozizé would return to the country and stand as a candidate in the October 2015 presidential election. On 8 December 2015, the Constitutional Court announced the list of approved presidential candidacies. Bozizé, who was still in exile, was barred from standing. Officially, he was excluded on the grounds that he was not registered on the voter list and because he had agreed not to run again as part of the peace agreement in January 2013. Gunfire was subsequently reported in parts of Bangui, as his supporters reacted angrily to the news. The KNK said that Bozizé&#x27;s exclusion was &quot;the result of internal and external pressure&quot;, with many of his supporters alleging that the French government was involved in the decision.

At the end of 2019 Bozizé returned to CAR and announced his presidential candidacy for upcoming elections. However, on 3 December 2020 the Constitutional Court of CAR ruled that Bozizé did not satisfy the &quot;good morality&quot; requirement for candidates because of an international warrant and United Nations sanctions against him for alleged assassinations, torture and other crimes. The government then accused Bozizé of plotting a coup.

On 22 September 2023, Bozizé, who fled to Chad before moving to Guinea-Bissau, was sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment with hard labor by the Bangui Court of Appeal for unspecified crimes. On 30 April 2024, the Special Criminal Court in Bangui issued an international arrest warrant against him on charges of human rights abuses committed during his presidency, including in Bossembélé, which was dubbed as his &quot;personal prison&quot;. However, Guinea-Bissau, where Bozizé is currently living, does not allow for extradition.

<doc id="213626" wikidata="Q7096039" url="?curid=213626" title="Open Fire (Y&amp;T album)">
<text>Open Fire is the first live album released by American hard rock/heavy metal band Y&amp;T, released in 1985 by A&amp;M Records, produced by Scott Boorey and the band.

The live material on the album was recorded at various venues in Greater London in early 1985, and during April 5–6, 1985, at the Keystone club in Palo Alto, California. The Keystone songs – &quot;Go For the Throat&quot; and &quot;Open Fire&quot; – were recorded by Guy Charbonneau in Le Mobile, a mobile recording studio. All of the live tracks were remixed at A&amp;M Studios.

The song &quot;Summertime Girls&quot; is a studio recording, produced and engineered separately by Kevin Beamish at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys.

==Reception==
&quot;Open Fire&quot; would prove to be a success, spending 17 weeks on the Billboard 200, and peaking at Number 70. The album introduced the song &quot;Summertime Girls&quot; which would go on to become the band&#x27;s biggest hit, peaking at Number 16 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart. The song also appeared on the band&#x27;s next proper studio album, &quot;Down for the Count&quot;, which was released in November 1985.

Despite this, &quot;Open Fire&quot; would go on to become on the hardest albums to find by the band until Hip-O Records (a subsidiary of Universal that specializes in reissuing previously out-of-print albums and themed music compilations) reissued it with two bonus tracks in 2005. The bonus material consisted of live renditions of &quot;Black Tiger&quot; (which was previously unreleased) and &quot;Summertime Girls.&quot; The live version of &quot;Summertime Girls&quot; also appeared as the B-side of the studio cut when it was released as a single. In the same year, Majestic Rock Records also released the album on CD using the track list of the vinyl release. It featured a different front cover, but the back cover was the same as the original A&amp;M release, as well as the Hip-O reissue.

<text>Azriel Hildesheimer (also Esriel and Israel, ; 11 May 1820 – 12 June 1899) was a German rabbi and leader of Orthodox Judaism. He is regarded as a pioneering moderniser of Orthodox Judaism in Germany and as a founder of Modern Orthodox Judaism.

==Biography==
Hildesheimer was born in Halberstadt, Province of Saxony, Kingdom of Prussia, the son of Rabbi Löb Glee Hildesheimer, a native of Hildesheim, Electorate of Hanover, a city near Hanover. He attended the &quot;Hasharat Zvi&quot; school in Halberstadt, and, from age seventeen, the Yeshiva of Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger in Altona; &quot;chacham&quot; Isaac Bernays was one of his teachers and his model as a preacher. While studying in yeshiva Hildesheimer also studied classical languages. In 1840 he returned to Halberstadt, took his diploma at the public Königliches Dom-Gymnasium, and entered the University of Berlin; he became a disciple of the dominant Hegelian school. He studied Semitic languages and mathematics, and continued his study in Talmud. In 1842 he went to Halle upon Saale where he earned his doctorate from the University of Halle-Wittenberg in 1844 under Wilhelm Gesenius and Emil Rödiger (&quot;&quot;, English: &quot;On the Right Kind of Bible Interpretation&quot;). He then returned to Halberstadt, where he married Henrietta Hirsch, whose dowry made them financially independent.

In 1851 he became Rabbi of Eisenstadt (Kis Marton), Hungary (now located in Austria); the principal city of the Siebengemeinden or &quot;Sheva kehillot&quot;. His first notable act there was to found a parochial school, where correct German was used, and modern principles of pedagogy were adopted in teaching secular, as well as Jewish, subjects. Hildesheimer initially introduced limited secular studies in the elementary school; the older students received a secular education as well, but with a focus on mathematics and other subjects that would enhance their understanding of gemara.

Next, Hildesheimer established a Yeshiva. The Yeshiva was unusual in that it was the only Orthodox institution where students were required to have a significant secular education before they were admitted. Also, the curriculum devoted time to studying Tanach and the Hebrew language. Despite this approach, within a few years the Yeshiva attracted a large number of pupils. After beginning with six students in 1851, the seminary had 128 students in 1868, including one from the United States. His son, , was a professor there.

In 1869 the Orthodox minority in Berlin was granted government permission to found a separate Orthodox synagogal congregation, the (extant from 1869 to 1939, and again since 1989), then comprising about 200 families. They were dissatisfied with Rabbi Joseph Aub, appointed in 1867 by the &quot;Jüdische Gemeinde zu Berlin&quot; (till 1869 the only Jewish congregation in Berlin). Adass Jisroel chose Hildesheimer to represent them as an &quot;Orthodox rabbi of standing&quot;. Here, he similarly established a religious school and a yeshiva (&quot;Rabbinerseminar für das orthodoxe Judenthum in Berlin&quot; 1873–1880, then the name was shortened to &quot;Rabbiner-Seminar zu Berlin&quot;, known as the Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary), which immediately attracted thirty former pupils. Hildesheimer was thus the real intellectual founder and leader of the &quot;Adass Jisroel&quot; congregation.

Aided by Meyer Lehmann, the editor of &quot;Israelit&quot; in Mainz (Mayence), Hildesheimer &quot;exerted his whole energy&quot; in the fight against Reform Judaism. In 1861 he took his stand against Abraham Geiger by criticising Geiger, &quot;Die Geiger&#x27;sche Broschüre Notwendigkeit und Maass einer Reform des jüdischen Gottesdienstes&quot; (under the name variant Israel Hildesheimer, Mayence: Verlag der Le Roux&#x27;schen Hofbuchhandlung, 1861). (In fact, as early as 1847—as the representative of the communities in the Magdeburg district—he had energetically opposed the Reform attempts of Ludwig Philippson.)

Hildesheimer was &quot;simple in his habits and fearless&quot;; he had an unusual capacity for work; and his great Talmudic learning &quot;was joined to practical administrative ability&quot;. He was financially independent, and never accepted remuneration for his rabbinical activity. He was frequently engaged in philanthropic activities connected with his own congregation, but additionally, &quot;no labor was too great and no journey too long for him&quot; in the service of the Jews of Germany, Austria, Russia, and even Abyssinia and Persia, so that he came to be known as the &quot;international schnorrer&quot;. Hildesheimer also took a special interest in the welfare of the Jews of Palestine. In 1860, when the missionary society of Palestine provided seventy free dwellings for homeless Jews, Hildesheimer himself built houses in Jerusalem for the free use of Jewish pilgrims and for the poor.

Hildesheimer died in Berlin on 12 July 1899. His grave is preserved in the Cemetery of the Synagogal Congregation of Adass Jisroel on Wittlicher Straße, Berlin-Weißensee.

In Israel, the moshav (settlement) Azri&#x27;el is named after him, as well as streets in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.

===Writings===
Hildesheimer contributed articles to various journals and newspapers: the &quot;Jüdische Presse&quot;, &quot;Ha-Lebanon&quot;, &quot;He-Chalutz&quot; and &quot;Archives Israélites&quot;. During his lifetime he wrote his name in his books usually as Israel Hildesheimer. His son Hirsch was editor of the &quot;Jüdische Presse&quot;.

Other writings include:
*&quot;Materialien zur Beurtheilung der Septuaginta&quot;, in: &quot;Literaturblatt des Orients&quot;, 1848, Nos. 30 et seq.;
*&quot;Die Epitaphien der Grabsteine auf dem Hiesigen [of Halberstadt] Jüdischen Friedhofe&quot;, 1846;
*&quot;Verwaltung der Jüdischen Gemeinde Halberstadt&quot;, Halberstadt: Dölle, 1849.
*&quot;Offener Brief an den Redacteur der Monatsschrift &quot;Ben-Chananja&quot;, Leopold Löv&quot;, Vienna, 1858;
*&quot;ספר מנחה טהורה: כולל דינים מהלכות מליחה נדה חלה והדלקה / Minchah Tehorah&quot;, Solomon ben Moses Bonhard, Hildesheimer (ed.) Pressburg: 1860;
*&quot;Halachoth gedoloth: nach dem Texte der Handschrift der Vaticana /הלכות גדולות : על פי כתב יד רומי&quot;, with Simeon Ḳayara, Berlin: Itzkowski, 1888.
*&quot;Hukkat HaPesach&quot;

On the celebration of his seventieth birthday, in 1890, his friends and pupils published a literary &quot;Jubelschrift zum siebzigsten Geburtstag des Dr. Israel Hildesheimer, Rabbiner und Rector des Rabbiner-Seminars zu Berlin: Gewidmet von Freunden und Schülern / &quot; (Berlin: H. Engel, 1890).

==Modernisation within Orthodoxy==
Hildesheimer is regarded as a pioneering &quot;Moderniser&quot; of Orthodox Judaism in Germany. He was insistent that for Orthodox Jews living in the West, there was no possibility to segregate oneself behind ghetto walls. On the contrary, he felt that modern Jewish education must teach Jews how best to confront and deal with modernity in all of its aspects .

His firm conviction that traditional Judaism need have no fear of the light of European culture determined his attitude and his activity in Hungary and Germany from the start, and gave him a definite aim. In an address delivered at his rabbinical seminary and defining his position he said:

He thus undertook a variety of actions which render him a &quot;modern&quot; activist and institution-builder. The most important of these, as discussed above, are:
# Jewish education for males and females which included both religious and secular studies.
# The seminary which incorporated not only secular studies but academic scholarship.
# Maintaining traditional Jewish attachments to the Land of Israel and working with the non-Orthodox on its behalf.
# Working with communal leaders, even non-Orthodox ones, on issues that affected the community, such as anti-Semitism and ritual slaughtering.

===Orthodox opposition===
The introduction into the Eisenstadt School of modern methods of education and of secular learning was resented by the Orthodox. Hildesheimer&#x27;s &quot;liberal tendencies and sympathy with modern culture&quot; soon changed this resentment &quot;to positive antipathy&quot;. Eventually his Yeshiva was denounced before the representatives of the government at Oedenburg, the result being that the Hungarian government ordered the school closed within twenty-four hours and the pupils removed from the city. Soon afterward (in 1858), however, Hildesheimer succeeded in obtaining state recognition for the Yeshiva. Interestingly, the Yeshiva also had opponents on the left: Reform saw it as a threat because its graduates would be equipped to defend Orthodoxy against Reform&#x27;s inroads. In 1860, the “zealot” Akiva Yosef Schlesinger placed Hildesheimer under a ban as &quot;not truly a sincere Jew&quot; (&quot;emessdiger Jüd&quot;). Hildesheimer, however, seems to have cared little for the ban.

At the Hungarian Jewish Congress of 14 December 1868, Hildesheimer at first endeavored to associate himself with the existing Orthodox party. When the impossibility of this union became evident, he formed a separate group, with thirty-five followers, which has been described as &quot;Cultured Orthodox&quot;. In the Hungarian Jewish Congress held at Budapest in 1869 he defined this party as representing a &quot;faithful adherence to traditional teachings combined with an effective effort to keep in touch with the spirit of progress&quot;.

<text>The Boeing P-26 &quot;Peashooter&quot; is the first American production all-metal fighter aircraft and the first pursuit monoplane to enter squadron service with the United States Army Air Corps. Designed and built by Boeing, the prototype first flew in 1932, and the type was still in use with the U.S. Army Air Corps as late as 1941 in the Philippines. There are two surviving Peashooters and three reproductions on display, with two more under construction.

==Design and development==

The project, funded by Boeing, to produce the Boeing Model 248 began in September 1931, with the US Army Air Corps supplying the engines and the instruments. The open cockpit, fixed landing gear, externally braced wing design was the last such design procured by the USAAC as a fighter. The Model 248 had a high landing speed, which caused a number of accidents. To remedy this, flaps were fitted to reduce the landing speed. The Army Air Corps ordered three prototypes, designated &quot;XP-936&quot;, which first flew on 20 March 1932.

The Boeing XP-936&#x27;s headrest offered little protection should it overturn on landing, risking injury to the pilot. As a result, production Model 266s (&quot;P-26A&quot;s) had a taller headrest installed to provide protection.

Two fighters were completed as &quot;P-26B&quot;s with fuel-injected Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1340-33 engines. These were followed by twenty-three &quot;P-26C&quot;s, with carburated R-1340-27s and modified fuel systems. Both the Spanish Air Force (one aircraft) and the Republic of China Air Force (eleven aircraft) ordered examples of the Boeing &quot;Model 281&quot;, an export version comparable to the P-26C, in 1936.

The &quot;Peashooter&quot;, as it was known by service pilots, was faster than previous American combat aircraft. Nonetheless, rapid progress in aviation led to it quickly becoming an anachronism, with wire-braced wings, fixed landing gear and an open cockpit. The cantilever-wing Dewoitine D.500 flew the same year as the P-26 and two years afterwards, the Soviet I-16 with retractable landing gear started flying. By 1935, just three years after the P-26, the Curtiss P-36, Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Hawker Hurricane were flying, all with enclosed cockpits, retractable landing gear and cantilever wings. However, some P-26s remained in service until after the United States entered World War II in December 1941.

==Operational history==
===U.S. Army Air Corps===
Deliveries to USAAC pursuit squadrons began in December 1933 with the last production P-26C aircraft coming off the assembly line in 1936. Ultimately, 22 squadrons flew the Peashooter, with peak service being six squadrons, in 1936. P-26s were the frontline fighters of the USAAC until 1938, when Seversky P-35s and Curtiss P-36s began to replace them. A total of twenty P-26s were lost in accidents between 1934 and America&#x27;s entry into World War II on 7 December 1941, but only five of them were before 1940.
Air Corps units using the P-26 were the:
*1st Pursuit Group (17th, 27th, and 94th PS), Selfridge Field, Michigan;
* 4th Composite Group (3d, 17th, and 20th PS), Nichols and Clark fields, Philippine Department.
*8th Pursuit Group (33rd, 35th, and 36th PS), Langley Field, Virginia;
*16th Pursuit Group (24th and 78th PS), Albrook Field, Panama Canal Zone;
*17th Pursuit Group (34th, 73d, and 95th PS), March Field, California
*18th Pursuit Group (6th and 19th PS), Wheeler Field, Hawaii; and
*20th Pursuit Group (55th, 77th, and 79th PS), Barksdale Field, Louisiana.

====Overseas deployments====
Between 1938 and 1940, P-26s were assigned overseas to supplement Seversky P-35s in two defense units based at Wheeler Field, Territory of Hawaii:
*18th Pursuit Group (6th, 19th, 73d, and 78th PS)
*15th Pursuit Group (45th and 47th PS).

The 17th PG became the 17th Attack Group in 1935, and its P-26s were transferred in 1938 to the 16th Pursuit Group (24th, 29th, and 78th PS) at Albrook Field in the Panama Canal Zone. These P-26s were transferred in 1940 to the 37th Pursuit Group (28th, 30th, and 31st PS) which flew them until they were replaced by P-40s in May 1941. Some continued service with the 32d Pursuit Group (51st and 53rd PS), but only nine P-26s remained operational in Central America at the start of World War II, although seven P-26As remained on strength with the Sixth Air Force as late as May 1943.

P-26As were also flown by the 3d PS of the 4th Composite Group, based in the Philippines. Between 1937 and 1941, 31 were sold to the fledgling Philippine Army Air Corps.

===Combat service===

The first example to see combat was a Model 281 sent to Spain before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. It was operated by the Spanish Republican Air Force, but no kills were made with it before it was shot down on October 21, 1936.

On 15 August 1937, eight 281s from the Chinese Nationalist Air Force 3rd Pursuit Group, 17th Squadron, based at Chuyung airfield, engaged eight of twenty Mitsubishi G3M &quot;Nell&quot; medium bombers from the Kisarazu Air Group attacking Nanking. Four of the Chinese fighters shot down three of the fourteen Japanese bombers destroyed that day without suffering any losses, while Chinese Hawk IIs, Hawk IIIs and Fiat CR.32s claimed the other eleven. Subsequent engagements between the Chinese 281 pilots and Japanese Navy Mitsubishi A5Ms were the first aerial dogfights and kills between all-metal monoplane fighter aircraft. Chinese-American volunteer pilots who joined the Chinese Air Force in the mid-1930s include aces John &quot;Buffalo&quot; Huang and John Wong Pan-yang, both of whom successfully fought the Japanese in the 281. John Wong Pan-yang scored two shared kills over A5Ms on 22 September 1937 and a solo kill over an A5M on 12 October 1937 over Nanking while in his Boeing 281.
By December 1941, U.S. fighter strength in the Philippines included 28 P-26s, 12 of which were operational with the 6th Pursuit Squadron of the Philippine Army Air Corps. Captain Jesús A. Villamor and his squadron of P-26s engaged Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zeros above Zablan and Batangas Fields and, despite being outclassed, Villamor and his squadron claimed four kills, one Mitsubishi G3M bomber and three Zeros, two by Villamor himself. For these actions, Villamor was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and an Oak Leaf Cluster.
The P-26s were burned to prevent their capture by advancing Imperial Japanese Army forces on 24 December 1941. Nine P-26s remained airworthy with the United States Army Air Forces (as the USAAC had been renamed in June 1941) in the Panama Canal Zone.

During 1942–1943, the &quot;Fuerza Aérea Guatemalteca&quot; (Guatemalan Air Force) acquired seven P-26s, which the United States government delivered to Guatemala as &quot;Boeing PT-26A&quot; trainers to circumvent restrictions on sales of fighters to Latin American countries. The P-26&#x27;s last combat operation was with the Guatemalan Air Force during a 1954 coup d&#x27;état. The final pair of P-26s still flying in military service in the world would be replaced with North American P-51 Mustangs two years later in 1956.

Although Boeing produced the prototype XF8B in 1944 and the X-32 entry in the Joint Strike Fighter contest in 2000, the P-26 was the last Boeing Company fighter aircraft to enter service until Boeing acquired McDonnell Douglas in 1997 and took over its production and continuing support contracts for the F-15 Eagle and the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.

==Surviving aircraft==

*P-26A c/n 1899 serial number &quot;33-123&quot; is on display at the Planes of Fame Museum in Chino, California, and is the only remaining flying P-26. This aircraft was flown by the 27th Pursuit Squadron at Selfridge Field, Michigan and the 20th Pursuit Group at Barksdale Field, Louisiana before being deployed to the Panama Canal Zone. It was later sold to the Guatemalan Air Force on 11 May 1943, and it flew as FAG 0672 until it was retired in 1957. Flown regularly with the registration N3378G, the museum placed it on static display in the mid-1980s to protect it. In 2004, the decision was made to again fly the P-26, and it made its first public flight during the museum&#x27;s air show in May 2006. The aircraft was shipped across the Atlantic and flown and displayed at Duxford Aerodrome in England in July 2014 during the type&#x27;s first post-World War II visit to Europe.
*P-26A c/n 1911 serial number &quot;33-135&quot; is with the Smithsonian Institution′s National Air and Space Museum&#x27;s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia This aircraft was assigned to the 94th Pursuit Squadron at Selfridge Field, Michigan, until being sent to the Panama Canal Zone. It was sold to the Guatemalan Air Force on 11 May 1943, and it was flown as FAG 0816 until retired in 1957 when it was donated to the Smithsonian. This aircraft was restored by the USAF, and was displayed at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in 34th Attack Squadron markings until 1975, when it was returned to the National Air and Space Museum in 1976.
