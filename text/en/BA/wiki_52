<text>John Llewellyn Lewis (February 12, 1880 – June 11, 1969) was an American leader of organized labor who served as president of the United Mine Workers of America (UMW) from 1920 to 1960. A major player in the history of coal mining, he was the driving force behind the founding of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), which established the United Steel Workers of America and helped organize millions of other industrial workers in the 1930s, during the Great Depression. After resigning as head of the CIO in 1940, thus keeping his promise of resignation if President Franklin Delano Roosevelt won the 1940 election against Wendell Willkie, Lewis took the United Mine Workers out of the CIO in 1942 and in 1944 took the union into the American Federation of Labor (AFL).

Lewis was a Republican but played a major role in helping Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt win a landslide victory for the US presidency in 1936. He was an isolationist, and broke with Roosevelt in 1940 on FDR&#x27;s anti-Nazi foreign policy. Lewis was an effective, aggressive fighter and strike leader who gained high wages for his membership while steamrolling over his opponents, including the United States government. Lewis was one of the most controversial and innovative leaders in the history of labor, gaining credit for building the industrial unions of the CIO into a political and economic powerhouse to rival the AFL. During World War II, he was widely criticized for calling nationwide coal strikes, which critics believed to be damaging to the American economy and war effort.

His massive leonine head, forest-like eyebrows, firmly set jaw, powerful voice, and ever-present scowl thrilled his supporters, angered his enemies, and delighted cartoonists. Coal miners for 40 years hailed him as their leader, whom they credited with bringing high wages, pensions and medical benefits. After his successor died shortly after taking office, Lewis hand-picked Tony Boyle, a miner from Montana, to take the presidency of the union in 1963.

==Early life and rise to power==
Lewis was born in or near Cleveland, Lucas County, Iowa (distinct from the present township of Cleveland in Davis County), to Thomas H. Lewis and Ann (Watkins) Lewis, immigrants from Llangurig, Wales. Cleveland was a company town, built around a coal mine developed one mile east of the town of Lucas. His mother and grandparents were members of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS), and the boy was raised in the church&#x27;s views regarding alcohol and sexual propriety, as well as a just social order that favored the poor. While his maternal grandfather was an RLDS pastor and Lewis periodically donated to his local RLDS church for the rest of his life, there is no definite evidence that he formally joined the Midwestern Mormon denomination.

Lewis attended three years of high school in Des Moines and at the age of 17 went to work in the Big Hill Mine at Lucas. In 1906, Lewis was elected a delegate to the United Mine Workers (UMW) national convention. In 1907, he ran for mayor of Lucas and launched a feed-and-grain distributorship. Both were failures and Lewis returned to coal mining.

He moved to Panama, Illinois, where in 1909 he was elected president of the UMW local. In 1911 Samuel Gompers, the head of the AFL, hired Lewis as a full-time union organizer. Lewis traveled throughout Pennsylvania and the Midwest as an organizer and trouble-shooter, especially in coal and steel districts.

==United Mine Workers of America==

After serving as statistician and then as vice-president for the UMWA, Lewis became that union&#x27;s acting president in 1919. On November 1, 1919, he called the first major coal union strike, and 400,000 miners walked off their jobs. President Woodrow Wilson obtained an injunction, which Lewis obeyed, telling the rank and file, &quot;We cannot fight the Government.&quot; In 1920, Lewis was elected president of the UMWA. He quickly asserted himself as a dominant figure in what was then the largest and most influential trade union in the country. 

Coal miners worldwide were sympathetic to socialism, and in the 1920s, Communists systematically tried to seize control of UMWA locals. William Z. Foster, the Communist leader, opposed dual unions in favor of organizing within the UMWA. The radicals were most successful in the bituminous (soft) coal regions of the Midwest, where they used local organizing drives to gain control of locals, sought a national labor political party, and demanded federal nationalization of the industry. Lewis, committed to cooperation among labor, management, and government, took tight control of the union.

He placed the once-autonomous districts under centralized receivership, packed the union bureaucracy with men directly beholden to him, and used UMWA conventions and publications to discredit his critics. The fight was bitter but Lewis used armed force, red-baiting, and ballot-box stuffing and, in 1928, expelled the leftists. As Hudson (1952) shows, they started a separate union, the National Miners&#x27; Union. In Southern Illinois, amidst widespread violence, the Progressive Mine Workers of America challenged Lewis but were beaten back. After 1935, Lewis invited the radical organizers to work for his CIO organizing drives, and they soon gained powerful positions in CIO unions, including auto workers and electrical workers.

Lewis was often denounced as a despotic leader. He repeatedly expelled his political rivals from the UMWA, including John Walker, John Brophy, Alexander Howat and Adolph Germer. Communists in District 26 (Nova Scotia), including Canadian labor legend J. B. McLachlan, were banned from running for the union executive after a strike in 1923. McLachlan described him as &quot;a traitor&quot; to the working class. Lewis nonetheless commanded great loyalty from many of his followers, even those he had exiled in the past.

A powerful speaker and strategist, Lewis used the nation&#x27;s dependence on coal to increase the wages and improve the safety of miners, even during several severe recessions. He masterminded a five-month strike, ensuring that the increase in wages gained during World War I would not be lost. In 1921 Lewis challenged Samuel Gompers, who had led the AFL for nearly forty years, for the presidency of the AFL. William Green, one of his subordinates within the Mine Workers at the time, nominated him; William Hutcheson, the President of the Carpenters, supported him. Gompers won. Three years later, on Gompers&#x27; death, Green succeeded him as AFL President.
In 1924, Lewis a Republican, framed a plan for a three-year contract between the UMWA and the coal operators, providing for a pay rate of $7.50 per day ($ in dollars). President Coolidge and then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover were impressed with the plan, and Lewis was offered the post of Secretary of Labor in Coolidge&#x27;s cabinet. Lewis declined, a decision he later regretted. Without government support, the contract talks failed and coal operators hired non-union miners. The UMWA treasury was drained, but Lewis was able to maintain the union and his position within it. He was successful in winning the 1925 anthracite (hard coal) miners&#x27; strike by his oratorical skills.

===Great Depression===
Lewis supported Republican Herbert Hoover for US president in 1928; in 1932, as the Great Depression bore brutally on the mining camps, he officially backed Hoover but quietly supported Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1936, his union made the largest single contribution, over $500,000, to Roosevelt&#x27;s successful campaign for reelection.

Lewis was appointed a member of the Labor Advisory Board and the National Labor Board of the National Recovery Administration in 1933; he used these positions to raise wages of miners and reduce competition. He gambled on a massive membership drive and won, as he piggybacked on FDR&#x27;s popularity: &quot;The President wants you to join the UMW!&quot; Coal miners represented many ethnic groups, and Lewis shrewdly realized that they shared a faith in Roosevelt; he was careful not to antagonize any of the immigrant ethnic groups, and he appealed to African-American members as well.

He secured the passage of the Guffey Coal Act in 1935, which was superseded by Guffey-Vinson Act in 1937 after the 1935 act was declared by the US Supreme Court to be unconstitutional. Both of acts were favorable to miners. Lewis had long had the idea that the highly competitive bituminous coal industry, with its sharp ups and downs and cut-throat competition, could be stabilized by a powerful union that set a standard wage scale and could keep recalcitrant owners in line with selective strikes. The acts made that possible, and coal miners entered a golden era. At all times, Lewis rejected socialism and promoted competitive capitalism.

==Founding the CIO==
With the open support of the AFL and the tacit support of the UMWA, Franklin D. Roosevelt was nominated and elected president in 1932, and Lewis benefited from the New Deal programs that followed. Many of his members received relief. Lewis helped secure passage of the Guffey Coal Act of 1935, which raised prices and wages, but it was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Thanks to the 1935 National Labor Relations Act, union membership grew rapidly, especially in the UMWA. Lewis and the UMW were major financial backers of Roosevelt&#x27;s reelection in 1936 and were firmly committed to the New Deal.

At the AFL&#x27;s annual convention in 1934, Lewis gained an endorsement from them of the principle of industrial unionism, as opposed to limitations to skilled workers. His goal was to unionize 400,000 steel workers, using his UMWA resources (augmented by leftists he had expelled in 1928). With the leaders of nine other large industrial unions and the UMWA in November 1935, Lewis formed the &quot;Committee for Industrial Organization&quot; to promote the organization of workers on an industry-wide basis. Key allies were Philip Murray (the UMWA man Lewis picked to head the steel union); Sidney Hillman, president of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA); and David Dubinsky of the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union (ILGWU).

The entire CIO group was expelled from the AFL in November 1938 and became the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), with Lewis as the first president. The growth of the CIO was phenomenal in steel, rubber, meat, autos, glass and electrical equipment. In early 1937, his CIO affiliates won collective-bargaining contracts with two of the most powerful anti-union corporations, General Motors and United States Steel. General Motors surrendered as a result of the great Flint Sit-Down Strike, during which Lewis negotiated with company executives, Governor Frank Murphy of Michigan, and President Roosevelt. U.S. Steel conceded without a strike, as Lewis secretly negotiated an agreement with Myron Taylor, chairman of U.S. Steel.

The CIO gained enormous strength and prestige from the victories in automobiles and steel and escalated its organizing drives, targeting industries that the AFL had long claimed, especially meatpacking, textiles, and electrical products. The AFL fought back and gained more members, but the two rivals spent much of their energy fighting each other for members and for power inside local Democratic organizations.

===Lewis rhetoric===

Journalist C. L. Sulzberger described Lewis&#x27;s rhetorical skill in the &quot;Crust of Bread&quot; speech. Operators who opposed a contract were often shamed into agreement by Lewis&#x27;s accusations. A typical Lewis speech to operators would go, &quot;Gentlemen, I speak to you for the miners&#x27; families... The little children are gathered around a bare table without anything to eat. They are not asking for a $100,000 yacht like yours, Mr...&quot; (here, he would gesture with his cigar toward an operator), &quot;...or for a Rolls-Royce limousine like yours, Mr. ...&quot; (staring at another operator). They are asking only for a slim crust of bread.&quot;

===World War II===
In the presidential election of 1940, Lewis rejected Roosevelt and supported Republican Wendell Willkie. The reasons for Lewis&#x27; souring on FDR and his New Deal are still contested. Some cite his frustration over FDR&#x27;s response to the General Motors and &quot;Little Steel&quot; strikes of 1937, or the President&#x27;s purported rejection of Lewis&#x27; proposal to join him on the 1940 Democratic ticket. Others point to power struggles within the CIO as the motivation for Lewis&#x27; actions. Lewis drew fierce criticism from most union leaders. Reuben Soderstrom, President of the Illinois State Federation of Labor, ripped his former ally apart in the press, saying he had become &quot;the most imaginative, the most efficient, the most experienced truth-twisting windbag that this nation has yet produced.&quot; Lewis failed to persuade his fellow members. On election day, 85% of CIO members supported Roosevelt, thus rejecting Lewis&#x27;s leadership. He resigned as president of the CIO but kept control of the UMWA.

Prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Lewis was staunchly opposed to American entry into World War II. Initially, he tapped into the anti-militarism that animated the left wing of the CIO. He publicly opposed the prospect of a peacetime draft as &quot;associated with fascism, totalitarianism and the breakdown of civil liberties,&quot; claiming in his 1940 Labor Day speech that there was &quot;something sinister about the attempt to force conscription upon our nation, with no revelation of the purposes for which conscription is sought.&quot; Lewis&#x27; opposition to American intervention continued after the leftist coalition against it had splintered. In August 1941 he joined Herbert Hoover, Alfred Landon, Charles Dawes, and other prominent conservatives in their appeal to Congress to halt President Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;step-by-step projection of the United States into undeclared war.&quot; This action earned him the enmity of those on the left, including Lee Pressman and Len De Caux.

After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Lewis threw his full support behind FDR&#x27;s government, stating &quot;When the nation is attacked every American must rally to its support. All other consideration becomes insignificant...With all other citizens I join in the support of our government to the day of its ultimate triumph over Japan and all other enemies.&quot;

In October 1942, Lewis withdrew the UMWA from the CIO. Six months later, he substantively violated organized labor&#x27;s no-strike pledge, spurring President Roosevelt to seize the mines. The strike damaged the public&#x27;s perception of organized labor generally and Lewis specifically; the Gallup poll of June 1943 showed 87% disapproval of Lewis. Some have asserted that Lewis&#x27; actions produced shortages which crippled wartime production in the defense industry.

===Postwar===

In the postwar years, Lewis continued his militancy; his miners went on strikes or &quot;work stoppages&quot; annually. In 1945 to 1950, he led strikes that President Harry S. Truman denounced as threats to national security. In response, industry, railroads and homeowners rapidly switched from coal to oil.

After briefly affiliating with the AFL, Lewis broke with them again over signing non-Communist oaths required by the 1947 Taft–Hartley Act, making the UMW independent. Lewis, never a Communist, still refused on principle to allow any of his officials to take the non-Communist oath required by the Taft–Hartley Act; the UMW was therefore denied legal rights protected by the National Labor Relations Board. He denounced Taft-Hartley as authorizing &quot;government by injunction&quot; and refused to follow its provisions, saying he would not be dictated to. This opposition to labor injunctions meant that Lewis supported attempts to weaken the Civil Rights Act of 1957 by denying the powers of injunctions for voting access cases, which also meant that the ability of judges to lay union injunctions was limited. 

Lewis secured a welfare fund financed entirely by the coal companies but administered by the union. In May 1950, he signed a new contract with the coal operators, ending nine months of regional strikes and opening an era of peaceful negotiations that brought wage increases and new medical benefits, including regional hospitals in the hills.

==1950s==
In the 1950s, Lewis won periodic wage and benefit increases for miners and led the campaign for the first Federal Mine Safety Act in 1952. Lewis tried to impose some order on a declining industry through collective bargaining, and maintaining standards for his members by insisting that small operators agree to contract terms that effectively put many of them out of business. Mechanization nonetheless eliminated many of the jobs in his industry, while scattered non-union operations persisted.

Lewis continued to be as autocratic within the UMWA, padding the union payrolls with his friends and family, ignoring or suppressing demands for a rank-and-file voice in union affairs. Finally in 1959 the passage of the Landrum–Griffin Act forced reform. It ended the practice where the UMWA had kept a number of its districts in trusteeship for decades, meaning that Lewis appointed union officers who otherwise would have been elected by the membership.

Lewis retired in early 1960. The highly paid membership slipped below 190,000 because of mechanization, strip mining, and competition from oil. He was succeeded as president by Thomas Kennedy, who served briefly until his death in 1963. He was succeeded by Lewis&#x27;s anointed successor, W. A. Boyle, known as Tony, a miner from Montana. He was considered just as dictatorial as Lewis, but without any of the longtime leader&#x27;s skills or vision.

==Retirement and final years==

On September 14, 1964, four years after his retirement from the UMWA, Lewis was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon B. Johnson, his citation reading: 
&quot;[An] eloquent spokesman of labor, [Lewis] has given voice to the aspirations of the industrial workers of the country and led the cause of free trade unions within a healthy system of free enterprise.&quot;
In 1965, Lewis received the first Eugene V. Debs Award for his service to Industrial Unionism.

Lewis retired to his family home, the Lee–Fendall House in Alexandria, Virginia, where he had lived since 1937. He lived there until his death on June 11, 1969. His passing elicited many kind words and fond remembrances, even from former rivals. &quot;He was my personal friend,&quot; wrote Reuben Soderstrom, the President of the Illinois AFL-CIO, who had once lambasted Lewis as an &quot;imaginative windbag,&quot; upon news of his death. Lewis, he said, would forever be remembered for &quot;making almost a half million poorly paid and poorly protected coal miners the best paid and best protected miners in all the world.&quot; He is buried in Oak Ridge Cemetery, Springfield, Illinois.

<text>This article lists the metropolitans and [[Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus&#x27;|patriarchs of Moscow]], spiritual heads of the Russian Orthodox Church. Since 1308, there have been 59.

== History ==

The Russian Orthodox Church traces its beginnings to the Christianization of Kievan Rusʹ at Kiev in 988 AD. In 1316 the Metropolitan of Kiev changed his see to the city of Vladimir, and in 1322 moved again to Moscow. In 1589, the see was elevated to a Patriarchate. The Patriarchate was abolished by the Church reform of Peter the Great in 1721 and replaced by the Most Holy Governing Synod, and the Bishop of Moscow came to be called a Metropolitan again. The Patriarchate was restored by the 1917–18 Local Council and suspended by the Soviet government in 1925. It was reintroduced for the last time by the 1943 Bishops&#x27; Council, during World War II by the initiative of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin.
To this date, 19 of the Metropolitans have been glorified in the Russian Orthodox Church.

== Metropolitans of Kiev and all Rus&#x27; (permanent residence in Moscow, 1325–1441) ==
&quot;For a list of metropolitans before the seat of the Metropolis of Kiev and all Rus&#x27; was moved to Moscow, see List of metropolitans and patriarchs of Kyiv.&quot;

Isidore of Kiev, who was of Greek origin, submitted to the articles of the Bull of Union with the Greeks which united the Orthodox Church in Russia with the Latin Church. Following his acceptance of the Council of Florence, Isidore returned to Moscow in 1441 as a Ruthenian cardinal. He was arrested by the Grand Prince of Moscow — Vasily II, and accused of apostasy. The Grand Duke deposed Isidore and in 1448 installed his own candidate as Metropolitan of Kiev — Jonah. This was carried out without the approval of Patriarch Gregory III of Constantinople. When Isidore died in 1458, the Orthodox dioceses within the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, including Kiev, were reorganized. The metropolitan see was moved to Vilnius, the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. A parallel succession to the title ensued between Moscow and Vilnius.

== Metropolitans of Moscow and all Rus&#x27; (1448–1589) ==
The Grand Prince of Moscow voided the Union of Florence and imprisoned Metropolitan Isidore for some time. Following that incident, the Grand Prince removed Isidore from office and appointed his own man — Jonah. These decisions were not recognised by Patriarch Gregory III of Constantinople who continued to recognise Isidore as the canonical metropolitan. As a result, in 1448, Jonah unilaterally changed his title to &quot;Metropolitan of Moscow and all Rus&#x27; &quot; which was tantamount to a declaration of independence of the Church in eastern Rus&#x27; from the Patriarchate of Constantinople. All sixteen successive hierarchs of the Metropolis of Moscow and all Rus&#x27; were selected by the civil power and installed without the approval of Patriarchate of Constantinople. Successive patriarchs continued to recognize Isidore and his successors as hierarchs of the Metropolis of Kiev and all Rus&#x27;.

<text>Kate Garry Hudson (born April 19, 1979) is an American actress and singer. She has received various accolades, including a Golden Globe Award and a nomination for an Academy Award.

Born to singer Bill Hudson and actress Goldie Hawn, Hudson made her film debut in the 1998 drama &quot;Desert Blue&quot;, which was followed by supporting roles in several films. She rose to prominence with her portrayal of Penny Lane in Cameron Crowe&#x27;s musical drama &quot;Almost Famous&quot; (2000), for which she won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress and received an Oscar nomination in the same category.

Throughout the 2000s, Hudson starred in a succession of romantic comedies, most notably in &quot;How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days&quot; (2003), &quot;You, Me and Dupree&quot; (2006), &quot;Fool&#x27;s Gold&quot; (2008), and &quot;Bride Wars&quot; (2009). On television, she had a recurring role in the musical series &quot;Glee&quot; (2012–2013) and a starring role in the second season of &quot;Truth Be Told&quot; (2022). Her other film credits include &quot;The Skeleton Key&quot; (2005), &quot;Nine&quot; (2009), &quot;Rock the Kasbah&quot; (2015), &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; (2016), &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot; (2016), &quot;Music&quot; (2021), and &quot;Glass Onion&quot; (2022).

Hudson is a co-founder of the fitness brand and membership program Fabletics, operated by TechStyle Fashion Group. She is also the author of the non-fiction books &quot;Pretty Happy: Healthy Ways to Love Your Body&quot; (2016) and &quot;Pretty Fun: Creating and Celebrating a Lifetime of Tradition&quot; (2017). Hudson released her debut studio music album, &quot;Glorious&quot; in 2024.

== Early life ==
Hudson was born in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of Academy Award-winning actress Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson, an actor, comedian, and musician. Her parents divorced when she was 18 months old and she and her older brother, actor Oliver Hudson, were raised in Snowmass, Colorado, and Pacific Palisades, California, by her mother and her mother&#x27;s longtime boyfriend, actor Kurt Russell. Hudson&#x27;s ancestry is Italian (from her paternal grandmother), Hungarian Jewish (from her maternal grandmother), and the remainder a mix of English and some German. She was raised Jewish; like her mother, she also practices Buddhism.

Hudson has stated that her biological father &quot;doesn&#x27;t know me from a hole in the wall&quot;, and she considers Russell her father. Hudson has described her mother as &quot;the woman that I&#x27;ve learned the most from, and who I look up to, who has conducted her life in a way that I can look up to&quot;. She has four half-siblings: Emily and Zachary Hudson, from her biological father&#x27;s later marriage to actress Cindy Williams; Lalania Hudson, from his relationship with another woman; and Wyatt Russell, from her mother&#x27;s relationship with Kurt Russell.

In 1997, she graduated from Crossroads, a college preparatory school in Santa Monica. She was accepted to New York University, but chose to pursue an acting career instead of an undergraduate degree.

== Career ==
===1996–2001: Beginnings and &quot;Almost Famous&quot;===
At age 11, Hudson performed on stage at the Santa Monica Playhouse. She made her film debut in the dramedy &quot;Desert Blue&quot; (1998), and subsequently appeared in the romantic comedy &quot;200 Cigarettes&quot; (1999). She took on the roles of a college student in the psychological thriller &quot;Gossip&quot;, the lesbian daughter of the titular character in the dramedy &quot;Dr. T &amp; the Women&quot; and one of the leading roles in the romantic comedy &quot;About Adam&quot;, all of which were released during 2000.

Her breakthrough came with the role of a veteran groupie in Cameron Crowe&#x27;s semi-autobiographical dramedy &quot;Almost Famous&quot; (2000). She &quot;hung in and had turned down leads in other movies just to play the part&quot; and soon obtained it &quot;because of her loyalty&quot;, according to Crowe. For her performance, she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress at the 58th Golden Globe Awards and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress at the 73rd Academy Awards. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; put it on its end-of-the-decade, &quot;best-of&quot; list, saying, &quot;This power ballad of a movie also happens to be Crowe&#x27;s greatest (and most personal) film thanks to the golden gods of Stillwater and their biggest fan, Kate Hudson&#x27;s incomparable Penny Lane.&quot; She worked hard in avoiding association with her well-known parents, as she did not want to be perceived as someone who &quot;rode on somebody&#x27;s coattails&quot;.

===2002–2009: Romantic comedies===

In 2002, Hudson appeared in the remake of the historical romance &quot;The Four Feathers&quot;, as the fiancée of a young British officer (played by Heath Ledger). The film was panned by critics and had a lukewarm box office response. In her next film, the romantic comedy &quot;How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days&quot; (2003), Hudson starred with Matthew McConaughey, as a writer for a women&#x27;s magazine who, for an article, starts dating a guy and trying to drive him away using only the &quot;classic mistakes women make&quot; in relationships. The film was a box office success, grossing over US$100 million upon its release. She also starred opposite Naomi Watts in the Merchant-Ivory film &quot;Le Divorce&quot; (2003), portraying a woman who, with her sister, dispute the ownership of a painting by Georges de La Tour with the family of her former brother-in-law. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;C&quot; rating and wrote: &quot;I&#x27;m disappointed to report that Hudson and Watts have no chemistry as sisters&quot;.

Her next romantic comedies, &quot;Alex &amp; Emma&quot; (2003), in which she played a stubborn stenographer, and &quot;Raising Helen&quot; (2004), taking on the role of a young woman who becomes the guardian of her deceased sister&#x27;s children, were released to varying degrees of success. In 2005, Hudson starred in the supernatural thriller &quot;The Skeleton Key&quot;, as a young hospice nurse who acquires a job at a New Orleans plantation home, and becomes entangled in a supernatural mystery involving the house. In its review, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, describing her, wrote: &quot;Hudson, who dials back her native, Goldie-given charm here to give Caroline a no-nonsense brusqueness, manages to convincingly convey a fearless bullheadedness rather than less sympathetic naivete&quot;. The film was a box office hit, grossing over US$91.9 million worldwide ($47.9 million in North America). Her next film, the comedy &quot;You, Me and Dupree&quot;, in which she appeared with Owen Wilson and Matt Dillon as one half of a couple who allows an unemployed friend to move in, grossed US$21.5 million on its opening weekend of July 14, 2006. It eventually made US$130.4 million worldwide.

In 2007, Hudson directed the short film &quot;Cutlass&quot;, one of &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Reel Moments&quot; based on readers&#x27; personal essays, which starred Kurt Russell, Dakota Fanning, Virginia Madsen, Chevy Chase and Kristen Stewart. In the romantic comedy &quot;Fool&#x27;s Gold&quot; (2008), her second film with Matthew McConaughey, Hudson took on the role a divorced woman who returns with her former husband while searching for a lost treasure. She was certified in scuba diving in the Great Barrier Reef for the underwater scenes. The film made US$111.2 million worldwide. In &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Girl&quot;, another romantic comedy released in 2008, Hudson played the colleague of an amiable guy (Jason Biggs). Despite negative reviews, it was a moderate commercial success.

Hudson starred in &quot;Bride Wars&quot; (2009), alongside Anne Hathaway, playing two best friends who become rivals after their weddings are scheduled on the same day. The film was named among the 10 worst chick flicks of all time by &quot;Time&quot; in 2010, but was successful financially, grossing US$114.6 million globally. Her next film was the musical &quot;Nine&quot;, directed by Rob Marshall, in which she played a &quot;Vogue&quot; fashion journalist, alongside Daniel Day-Lewis, Marion Cotillard, Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman, and Judi Dench. The film was acclaimed by critics and Hudson garnered praise for her dancing skills, showcased in a 1960s-inspired original piece called &quot;Cinema Italiano&quot;, which was written specifically for her character.

===2010–2020: Career fluctuations===

Hudson starred with Casey Affleck and Jessica Alba, as the wife of a West Texas serial killer, in the film adaptation &quot;The Killer Inside Me&quot;, which premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. In 2011, Hudson played a quickwitted, carefree ad executive in the romantic comedy film &quot;A Little Bit of Heaven&quot;, and a party girl in another romantic comedy, &quot;Something Borrowed&quot;, based on Emily Giffin&#x27;s novel of the same name. In is review for the latter, &quot;Detroit News&quot; remarked: &quot;Kate Hudson looks exhausted, as if she is as tired of wading through another one of her feckless duds as we are of watching them&quot;. While &quot;A Little Bit of Heaven&quot; found a limited release in theaters, &quot;Something Borrowed&quot; was a moderate commercial success.

In 2012, Hudson was cast on the Fox teen comedy series &quot;Glee&quot;, in the recurring role of Cassandra July, a dance teacher at the fictitious New York Academy of the Dramatic Arts. In 2013, Hudson appeared in the political thriller &quot;The Reluctant Fundamentalist&quot;, as a photographer and the girlfriend of a professor at the University of Lahore. In 2014, she starred in the comedy &quot;Wish I Was Here&quot;, as the wife of a struggling actor, and the thriller &quot;Good People&quot;, as one half of a couple who fall into severe debt while renovating their family&#x27;s home. The aforementioned films received a limited release and mixed reviews from critics. In &quot;Rock the Kasbah&quot; (2015), Hudson played a top-hatted hooker with a heart of gold who befriends a has-been actor manager (Bill Murray) in Afghanistan. Despite a US$15-million budget, the film made just US$3 million at the North American box office.

Hudson voiced a crazy ribbon-dancing panda in the DreamWorks Animation film &quot;Kung Fu Panda 3&quot; (2016), which grossed US$521.1 million globally, and became her most widely seen film. She starred as a woman married to an Indian man and the sister of a lesbian woman, both of whom had not told their conservative parents, in the romantic comedy &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot; (2016), directed by Garry Marshall and opposite Julia Roberts, Timothy Olyphant, and Jason Sudeikis. The film was panned by critics and a moderate commercial success. She next played the wife of a chief electronics technician (Mark Wahlberg) in the drama &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot;, based on the Deepwater Horizon explosion. While critical response was positive, the film was only slightly profitable, making US$121.8 million on a budget of around US$110 million.

In the 2017 film &quot;Marshall&quot;, Hudson portrayed an employer accusing her black chauffeur of rape. It received positive reviews from critics but found a limited audience in theaters. 

===2021–present: Debut studio album=== 
In 2021, Hudson co-starred as Kazu Gamble in musical film &quot;Music&quot;, co-written and directed by Sia. She received her second overall Golden Globe nomination in the category of Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical for her work on the film at the 78th Golden Globe Awards. In 2021, she starred in &quot;Mona Lisa and the Blood Moon&quot;, a fantasy-adventure film by writer-director Ana Lily Amirpour. In 2022, she starred alongside Michael Shannon in &quot;A Little White Lie&quot; directed by Michael Maren. Also in 2022, Hudson co-starred in &quot;Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery&quot;, playing the role of Birdie Jay, a Manhattan supermodel turned fashion designer involved in a murder mystery.

Hudson signed a record deal with Virgin Music Group, and released her debut single, &quot;Talk About Love&quot; in January 2024. She wrote the song alongside her fiancée Danny Fujikawa and Linda Perry. She released the single &quot;Live Forever&quot; on March 28, 2024; the song was hailed by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;a love letter to parents&quot;. Hudson followed with &quot;Gonna Find Out&quot;, which was released on April 17, 2024. Hudson released her debut studio album, &quot;Glorious&quot;, on May 17, 2024. On August 28, 2024, Hudson released a cover of the 1985 &#x27;Til Tuesday single &quot;Voices Carry&quot;.

==Other ventures==
In 2013, Hudson, in a partnership with online fashion retailer TechStyle Fashion Group, launched her own line of workout clothes and active wear, Fabletics, which currently operates 25 stores in the United States. The venture became her focus, and in a 2018 interview, Hudson remarked: &quot;I work more on Fabletics now than I do on movies.&quot;

In 2016, Hudson released her first book, &quot;Pretty Happy: Healthy Ways to Love Your Body&quot;. In 2017, she released her second book, &quot;Pretty Fun: Creating and Celebrating a Lifetime of Tradition&quot;.

In August 2018, Hudson and New York &amp; Company announced their partnership, a multi-year deal to represent the ambassador for the company&#x27;s US$200-million Soho Jeans collection, and to develop her own fashion line. In 2018, Hudson collaborated with her mother Goldie to create a capsule collection, with 50 percent of net proceeds will benefit MindUP, a program within the Goldie Hawn Foundation.

In November 2019, Hudson launched King St. Vodka, a vodka from California. A podcast, &quot;Sibling Revelry&quot;, by Kate and her brother Oliver,&lt;ref name=&quot;people/sibling-revelry-podcast&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in &quot;playfully bickering&quot; while promoting it on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; in 2022.&lt;ref name=&quot;upi/6501643377980&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Hudson&#x27;s only marriage has been to Chris Robinson, lead singer for the Black Crowes. They married on December 31, 2000, in Aspen, Colorado. Their son was born in January 2004. The couple announced their separation in August 2006; Robinson filed for divorce that November, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce was finalized on October 22, 2007.

Before her marriage, Hudson dated actor Matt LeBlanc for at least one year beginning in 1995.

In 2010, Hudson began dating Muse lead vocalist and guitarist Matt Bellamy. They became engaged in April 2011, three months before the birth of their son. They broke up in 2014. They remain on good terms.

Hudson sued the British version of &quot;National Enquirer&quot; in 2006 after it reported she had an eating disorder, describing her as &quot;painfully thin&quot;. Hudson said the tabloid&#x27;s statements were &quot;a blatant lie&quot; and she was concerned about the impact the false report could have on impressionable young women. The newspaper apologized and compensated her.

In 2016, Hudson said: &quot;Meditation has been the most helpful and life-changing thing for me. You can feel the difference when you meditate on a regular basis. At least I can... I started practicing transcendental meditation a year and a half ago so I meditate 20 minutes in the morning and I try to do another 20 minutes in the afternoon.&quot;

<doc id="219353" wikidata="Q820037" url="?curid=219353" title="Miner">
<text>A miner is a person who extracts ore, coal, chalk, clay, or other minerals from the earth through mining. There are two senses in which the term is used. In its narrowest sense, a miner is someone who works at the rock face; cutting, blasting, or otherwise working and removing the rock. In a broader sense, a &quot;miner&quot; is anyone working within a mine, not just a worker at the rock face.

Renowned as one of the most dangerous jobs in the world - and for good reason. Cave-ins, explosions, toxic air, and extreme temperatures are some of the most perilous hazards observed to take place in underground mining, as well as the overall long-term health effects of underground mining conditions. In some countries, miners lack social guarantees and in case of injury may be left to cope without assistance.

In regions with a long mining tradition, many communities have developed cultural traditions and aspects specific to the various regions, in the forms of particular equipment, symbolism, music, and the like.

==Roles==
Different functions of the individual miner. Many of the roles are specific to a type of mining, such as coal mining.
Roles considered to be &quot;miners&quot; in the narrower sense have included:
*Hewer (also known as &quot;cake&quot; or &quot;pickman&quot;), whose job was to hew the rock.
**Collier, a hewer who hews coal with a pick.
*Driller, who works a rock drill to bore holes for placing dynamite or other explosives.

Other roles within mines that did not involve breaking rock (and thus fit the broader definition) have included:
*Loader (also called a &quot;bandsman&quot;), who loads the mining carts with coal at the arm.
*Putter (also known as a &quot;drags-man&quot;), who works the carts around the mine.
*Barrow-man, who transported the broken coal from the face in wheelbarrows.
*Hurrier, who transported coal carts from a mine to the surface.
*Timbers, who fashions and installs timber supports to support the walls and ceiling in an underground mine.

In addition to miners working in the seam, a mine employs other workers in duties in the sea. In addition to the office staff of various sorts, these may include:
*Brakesman, who operate the winding engine.
*Breaker boy who removes impurities from coal.
*Emergency Structure Engineer, who makes sure that cave-ins are dealt with when called

==Modern miners==

Mining engineers use the principles of math and science to develop philosophical solutions to technical problems for miners.
In most cases, a bachelor&#x27;s degree in engineering, mining engineering or geological engineering is required. Because technology is constantly changing, miners and mining engineers need to continue their education.
The basics of mining engineering includes finding, extracting, and preparing minerals, metals and coal. These mined products are used for electric power generation and manufacturing industries. Mining engineers also supervise the construction of underground mine operations and create ways to transport the extracted minerals to processing plants.

<doc id="219354" wikidata="Q1434880" url="?curid=219354" title="Surgeon General of the United States">
<text>The surgeon general of the United States is the operational head of the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (PHSCC) and thus the leading spokesperson on matters of public health in the federal government of the United States. The surgeon general&#x27;s office and staff are known as the Office of the Surgeon General (OSG), which is housed within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health.

The U.S. surgeon general is nominated by the president of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. The surgeon general must be appointed from individuals who are members of the regular corps of the U.S. Public Health Service and have specialized training or significant experience in public health programs. However, there is no time requirement for membership in the Public Health Service before holding the office of the Surgeon General, and nominees traditionally were appointed as members of the Public Health Service and as surgeon general at the same time. The surgeon general serves a four-year term of office and, depending on whether the current assistant secretary for health is a commissioned corps officer, is either the senior or next-most senior uniformed officer of the commissioned corps, holding the rank of vice admiral.

== Responsibilities ==
The surgeon general reports to the assistant secretary for health (ASH). The ASH may be a four-star admiral in the commissioned corps, and serves as the principal advisor to the secretary of health and human services on public health and scientific issues. The surgeon general is the overall head of the commissioned corps, a 6,500-member cadre of uniformed health professionals who are on call 24 hours a day and can be dispatched by the secretary of HHS or by the assistant secretary for health in the event of a public health emergency.

The surgeon general is also the ultimate award authority for several public health awards and decorations, the highest of which that can be directly awarded is the Surgeon General&#x27;s Medallion (the highest award bestowed by board action is the Public Health Service Distinguished Service Medal). The surgeon general also has many informal duties, such as educating the American public about health issues and advocating healthy lifestyle choices.

The office also periodically issues health warnings. Perhaps the best known example of this is the surgeon general&#x27;s warning label that has been present on all packages of American tobacco cigarettes since 1966. A similar health warning has appeared on alcoholic beverages labels since 1988.

== History ==
In 1798, Congress established the Marine Hospital Fund, a network of hospitals that cared for sick and disabled seamen. The Marine Hospital Fund was reorganized along military lines in 1870 and became the Marine Hospital Service—the predecessor to today&#x27;s United States Public Health Service. The service became a separate bureau of the Treasury Department with its own staff, administration, headquarters in Washington, D.C., and the position of supervising surgeon, later surgeon general.

After 141 years under the Treasury Department, the Service came under the Federal Security Agency in 1939, then the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) in 1953, and finally the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Prior to 1970, the surgeon general was traditionally selected from career uniformed officers. Today, the surgeon general is usually selected from the civilian community, who aligns more closely with the president&#x27;s political party. The office is not a particularly powerful one, and has little direct statutory impact on policy-making, but surgeons general are often vocal advocates of precedent-setting, far-sighted, unconventional, or even unpopular health policies.
* On January 11, 1964, Luther Terry published a landmark report saying that smoking may be hazardous to health, sparking nationwide anti-smoking efforts. Terry and his committee defined cigarette smoking of nicotine as &quot;not an addiction.&quot; The committee itself consisted largely of physicians who themselves smoked. This report went uncorrected for 24 years.
* In 1986, C. Everett Koop&#x27;s report on AIDS called for some form of AIDS education in the early grades of elementary school, and gave full support for using condoms for disease prevention. He also resisted pressure from the Reagan administration to report that abortion was psychologically harmful to women, stating he believed it was a moral issue rather than one concerning the public health.
* In 1994, Joycelyn Elders spoke at a United Nations conference on AIDS. She was asked whether it would be appropriate to promote masturbation as a means of preventing young people from engaging in riskier forms of sexual activity. She replied, &quot;I think that it is part of human sexuality, and perhaps it should be taught.&quot; Elders also spoke in favor of studying drug legalization. In a reference to the national abortion issue, she said, &quot;We really need to get over this love affair with the fetus and start worrying about children.&quot; She was fired by President Bill Clinton in December 1994.

The U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force also have officers overseeing medical matters in their respective services who hold the title &quot;Surgeon General,&quot; of their respective services, while the surgeon general of the United States is surgeon general of the entire nation.

The insignia of the surgeon general, and the USPHS, use the caduceus as opposed to the Rod of Asclepius.

== Service rank ==
The surgeon general is a commissioned officer in the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, one of the eight uniformed services of the United States, and by law holds the rank of vice admiral. Officers of the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps are classified as non-combatants, but can be subjected to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and the Geneva Conventions when designated by the commander-in-chief as a military force or if they are detailed or assigned to work with the armed forces. Officers of the commissioned corps, including the surgeon general, wear uniforms that are modeled after uniforms of the United States Navy and the United States Coast Guard, except that the commissioning devices, buttons, and insignia are unique. Officers in the U.S. Public Health Service wear unique devices that are similar to U.S. Navy staff corps officers (e.g., Navy Medical Service Corps, Supply Corps, etc.).

The only surgeon general to actually hold the rank of a four-star admiral was David Satcher (born 1941, served 1998–2002). This was because he served simultaneously in the positions of surgeon general (three-star) and assistant secretary for health (which is a four-star office). John Maynard Woodworth (1837–1879, served 1871–1879), was the first holder of the office as &quot;supervising surgeon.&quot;

<doc id="219357" wikidata="Q242416" url="?curid=219357" title="Marion Davies">
<text>Marion Davies (born Marion Cecilia Douras; January 3, 1897 – September 22, 1961) was an American actress, producer, screenwriter, and philanthropist. Educated in a religious convent, Davies fled the school to pursue a career as a chorus girl. As a teenager, she appeared in several Broadway musicals and one film, &quot;Runaway Romany&quot; (1917). She soon became a featured performer in the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;. While performing in the 1916 &quot;Follies&quot;, the nineteen-year-old Marion met the fifty-three-year-old newspaper tycoon, William Randolph Hearst, and became his mistress. Hearst took over management of Davies&#x27; career and promoted her as a film actress.

Hearst financed Davies’ pictures and promoted her career extensively in his newspapers and Hearst newsreels. He founded Cosmopolitan Pictures to produce her films. By 1924, Davies was the number one female box office star in Hollywood because of the popularity of &quot;When Knighthood Was in Flower&quot; and &quot;Little Old New York&quot;, which were among the biggest box-office hits of their respective years. During the zenith of the Jazz Age, Davies became renowned as the hostess of lavish soirees for Hollywood actors and political elites. However, in 1924, her name became linked with scandal when film producer Thomas Ince died at a party aboard Hearst&#x27;s yacht.

Following the decline of her film career during the Great Depression, Davies struggled with alcoholism. She retired from the screen in 1937 to devote herself to an ailing Hearst and charitable work. In Hearst&#x27;s declining years, Davies remained his steadfast companion until his death in 1951. Eleven weeks after Hearst&#x27;s death, she married sea captain Horace Brown. Their marriage lasted until Davies&#x27; death at 64 from malignant osteomyelitis (bone cancer) of the jaw in 1961.

By the time of her death, her popular association with the character of Susan Alexander Kane in the film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941) already overshadowed Davies&#x27; legacy as a talented actress. The title character&#x27;s second wife—an untalented singer whom he tries to promote—was widely assumed to be based upon Davies. However, many commentators, including writer-director Orson Welles, defended Davies&#x27; record as a gifted actress and comedienne to whom Hearst&#x27;s patronage did more harm than good. In his final years, Welles attempted to correct the widespread misconceptions the film had created about Davies&#x27; popularity and talents as an actress.

== Early life and education ==
Marion Cecilia Douras was born on January 3, 1897, in Brooklyn, the youngest of five children born to Bernard J. Douras, a lawyer and judge in New York City and Rose Reilly. Her father performed the civil marriage of socialite Gloria Gould Bishop. She had three older sisters, Ethel, Rose, and Reine. An older brother, Charles, drowned. His name was subsequently given to Davies&#x27; nephew, screenwriter Charles Lederer, the son of Davies&#x27; sister Reine Davies.

The Douras family lived near Prospect Park in Brooklyn. Educated in the Sacred Heart religious convent near the Hudson River and later a religious convent near Tours, France, Davies was uninterested in her academic studies and very unhappy as a child supervised by Catholic nuns. Her family was close friends with architect Stanford White, and Davies grew up learning about the Evelyn Nesbit sex scandal. 

Davies struggled with her stutter as a child, and convinced her mother to let her leave school early due to the torment of her classmates and teachers. As a teenager, Marion left school to pursue a career as a showgirl. When her sister Reine adopted the stage name of Davies after seeing a real estate billboard advertisement, Marion followed suit.

== Career ==
=== Early career on stage and in film ===

Davies worked as a chorus line dancer starting with &quot;Chin-Chin&quot;, a 1914 musical starring David C. Montgomery and Fred Stone, at the old Forrest Theatre in Philadelphia. She made her Broadway debut starring in the show at the Globe Theatre on October 20. She also appeared in &quot;Nobody Home&quot;, &quot;Miss Information&quot; and &quot;Stop, Look and Listen&quot;. When not dancing, she modeled for illustrators Harrison Fisher and Howard Chandler Christy.

In 1916, Davies was signed as a featured player in the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;. However, she encountered difficulties with her career as a Ziegfeld girl, as her persistent stammer prevented her from pronouncing any lines. Consequently, she was relegated only to dancing routines. While working for Florenz Ziegfeld, a cavalcade of admirers pursued her sexually. She came to loathe young college men: &quot;The stage-door-Johnnies I didn&#x27;t like. Especially those who came from Yale.&quot; During one infamous show starring Gaby Deslys, rowdy undergraduates from Yale pelted Davies and other chorus dancers with tomatoes and rotten eggs to show their displeasure with the performance.

While dancing in the &quot;Follies&quot; at the New Amsterdam Theatre in New York City, the teenage Davies was first observed by newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst, who was seated in the front row of the audience. Recalling this first encounter, Davies indicated she was afraid of Hearst initially:
Hearst purportedly went to the &quot;Follies&quot; show every night for eight weeks solely to gaze at Davies. Without Davies&#x27; knowledge, Hearst clandestinely arranged for an intermediary from Campbell&#x27;s Studio to invite her to be photographed in ornate costumes such as a Japanese geisha and a virginal bride. While the photos were being taken, Davies realized Hearst secretly was present in the darkness of the photography studio. Terrified, she fled to the dressing room and locked the door. However, Hearst abruptly departed without introducing himself. After months passed, they saw each other again in Palm Beach, Florida, but Hearst&#x27;s wife Millicent Hearst was present. They did not become intimate until sometime later.

After making her screen debut in 1916, and modelling gowns by Lady Duff-Gordon in a fashion newsreel, Davies appeared in &quot;Runaway Romany&quot; (1917), her first feature film. Davies wrote the film, which was directed by her brother-in-law, producer George W. Lederer. She continued to alternate between stage and screen until 1920 when she made her last revue appearance in &quot;Ed Wynn&#x27;s Carnival&quot;.

=== Hearst and Cosmopolitan Pictures ===

In 1918, Hearst formed Cosmopolitan Pictures and asked Davies to sign a $500-per-week exclusive contract with his studio. After she signed, 21-year-old Davies and 58-year-old Hearst began a sexual relationship. Using his vast newspaper empire and Hearst Metrotone Newsreels, Hearst decided to promote Davies on an enormous scale. His newsreels touted her social activities, and a reporter from the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; was assigned the full-time job of recounting Davies&#x27; daily exploits in print. Hearst expended an estimated $7 million on promoting Davies&#x27; career ().

Soon after, Hearst—who was still married to Millicent Hearst—moved Davies with her mother and sisters into an elegant Manhattan townhouse at the corner of Riverside Drive and W. 105th Street. Hearst ensured that, &quot;Marion&#x27;s new abode was nothing less than a palace fit for a movie-queen—especially since the queen would frequently be receiving the press on the premises.&quot; &quot;Cecilia of the Pink Roses&quot; in 1918 was her first film, backed by Hearst. He next secured Cosmopolitan&#x27;s distribution deals, first with Paramount Pictures, then with Samuel Goldwyn Productions, and with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

During the next ten years, Davies appeared in 29 films, an average of almost three films a year. One of her best known roles was as Mary Tudor in &quot;When Knighthood Was in Flower&quot; (1922), directed by Robert G. Vignola, with whom she collaborated on several films. The 1922–23 period may have been her most successful as an actress, with both &quot;When Knighthood Was in Flower&quot; and &quot;Little Old New York&quot; ranking among the top three box-office hits of those years. She was named the number one female box-office star by theater owners and crowned &quot;Queen of the Screen&quot; at their 1924 Hollywood convention. Other hit silent films included: &quot;Beverly of Graustark&quot;, &quot;The Cardboard Lover&quot;, &quot;Enchantment&quot;, &quot;The Bride&#x27;s Play&quot;, &quot;Lights of Old Broadway&quot;, &quot;Zander the Great&quot;, &quot;The Red Mill&quot;, &quot;Yolanda&quot;, &quot;Beauty&#x27;s Worth&quot;, and &quot;The Restless Sex&quot;.
In 1926, Hearst&#x27;s wife Millicent Hearst moved to New York, and Hearst and Davies moved to the palatial Hearst Castle in San Simeon, California, overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Upon visiting the sprawling Hearst Castle with its Greek statues and celestial suites, playwright George Bernard Shaw reportedly quipped: &quot;This is what God would have built if he had the money.&quot; When not holding court at San Simeon, Hearst and Davies resided at Marion&#x27;s equally luxurious beach house in Santa Monica, at Hearst&#x27;s rustic Wyntoon estate in Northern California, and St Donat&#x27;s Castle in Wales. During the heyday of the Jazz Age, the couple spent much of their time entertaining and holding extravagant soirees with famous guests, including many Hollywood actors and political figures. Frequent habitues and occasional visitors included Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Harpo Marx, Clark Gable, Calvin Coolidge, Winston Churchill, Charles Lindbergh, and Amelia Earhart, among others.

As the years passed, Hearst&#x27;s relentless efforts to promote Davies&#x27; career purportedly had a detrimental effect. According to Davies, Hearst grandiosely advertised her latest films with &quot;signs all over New York City and pictures in the papers ... I thought it got to be a little too much.&quot; Such unceasing publicity irritated the public. &quot;In New York city there were big signs, blocks and blocks of signs,&quot; Davies recalled, &quot;and people got so tired of the name Marion Davies that they would actually insult me.&quot; In her published memoirs &quot;The Times We Had&quot;, Davies concluded that such over-the-top promotion of her film career likely did more harm than good.

Hearst&#x27;s jealousy also interfered with Davies&#x27; career, especially in her earlier films and her stage roles. According to Davies, he often vetoed the casting of attractive leading men and typically would not permit her to be embraced on the screen or in stage plays. In her memoirs, Davies claimed to have repeatedly assailed Hearst&#x27;s jealous stewardship in vain: &quot;Everyone has to do a little embrace in pictures, just for the audience&#x27;s sake,&quot; she told him. However, Hearst would not relent. Consequently, many of her earlier pictures were regarded as sexless and featured &quot;no kissing at all&quot; even when a kiss was needed for a happy ending. Hearst insisted on personally rewriting Davies&#x27; film scripts, and his constant meddling often exasperated film directors such as Lloyd Bacon.

Hearst further hindered Davies&#x27; career by insisting she star only in costume dramas in which she often played &quot;a doll-sweetheart out of the 1890s, in the manner of D. W. Griffith heroines&quot;. Davies herself was more inclined to develop her comic talents alongside her friends Charlie Chaplin and Mary Pickford at United Artists, but Hearst pointedly discouraged this. He preferred seeing her in expensive historical pictures, but she also appeared in contemporary comedies like &quot;Tillie the Toiler&quot;, &quot;The Fair Co-Ed&quot; (both 1927), and especially three directed by King Vidor, &quot;Not So Dumb&quot; (1930), &quot;The Patsy&quot; and the backstage-in-Hollywood saga &quot;Show People&quot; (both 1928). &quot;The Patsy&quot; contains her imitations, which she usually did for friends, of silent stars Lillian Gish, Mae Murray and Pola Negri. Vidor saw Davies as a comedic actress instead of the dramatic actress that Hearst wanted her to be. He noticed she was the life of parties and incorporated that into his films.

=== Sound films and career decline ===

The coming of sound made Davies nervous because she had a persistent stutter. Her career progressed, nonetheless, and she made a number of films during the early sound era, including &quot;Marianne&quot; (1929), &quot;The Hollywood Revue of 1929&quot; (1929), &quot;The Florodora Girl&quot; (1930), &quot;The Bachelor Father&quot; (1931), &quot;Five and Ten&quot; (1931) with Leslie Howard, &quot;Polly of the Circus&quot; (1932) with Clark Gable, &quot;Blondie of the Follies&quot; (1932), &quot;Peg o&#x27; My Heart&quot; (1933), &quot;Going Hollywood&quot; (1933) with Bing Crosby, and &quot;Operator 13&quot; (1934) with Gary Cooper. During the filming of &quot;Operator 13&quot;, Hearst repeatedly caused problems on the set and insisted on directing a scene, much to film director Richard Boleslawski&#x27;s consternation.

At Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Davies was often involved with many aspects of her films and was considered an astute businesswoman. However, her career continued to be hampered by Hearst&#x27;s insistence that she play dramatic historical parts as opposed to the comic roles which were her forte. Hearst reportedly tried to persuade MGM production boss Irving Thalberg to cast Davies in the coveted title role of the 1938 historical drama &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot;, but Thalberg awarded the part to his ambitious wife, Norma Shearer. This rejection followed a previous one where Davies had been denied the female lead in &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot;, which went to Shearer as well. Despite Davies&#x27; friendship with the Thalbergs, Hearst reacted angrily by pulling his newspaper support for MGM and moving Davies and Cosmopolitan Pictures&#x27; distribution to Warner Brothers.

Davies&#x27; first film at Warner Brothers was &quot;Page Miss Glory&quot; (1935). During this period, a personal tragedy occurred in Davies&#x27; own life with the death of her vivacious 25-year-old niece, Pepi Lederer. Pepi had been a permanent resident at San Simeon for many years. She was a closeted lesbian who had sexual relationships with actresses Louise Brooks, Nina Mae McKinney, and others. At some point during the affair between Pepi and Brooks, Hearst became cognizant of Lederer&#x27;s lesbianism. According to Louise Brooks&#x27; memoirs, to avoid a public scandal or to forestall blackmail, Hearst arranged for Pepi to be committed to a mental institution for her drug addiction. In June 1935, mere days after her institutionalization, Pepi committed suicide by leaping to her death from an upper floor window of the Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles. Hearst purportedly used his press influence to have Pepi&#x27;s death obscured in the news cycle, and Davies arranged a funeral for her niece at a private chapel.

After a brief hiatus because of her niece&#x27;s suicide, Davies starred in &quot;Hearts Divided&quot; (1936) and &quot;Cain and Mabel&quot; (1936). Her final film for Warner Brothers was &quot;Ever Since Eve&quot; (1937). Mirroring earlier events at MGM, Warner Brothers purchased the rights to Robert E. Sherwood&#x27;s 1935 play &quot;Tovarich&quot; for Davies, but the lead role in the 1937 film adaptation was given to Claudette Colbert. Hearst shopped Davies and Cosmopolitan for another year, but no deals were made, and the actress officially retired. In 1943, Davies was offered the role of Mrs. Brown in &quot;Claudia&quot;, but Hearst dissuaded her from taking a supporting role and tarnishing her starring career. In her 45 feature films, over a 20-year period, Davies had never been anything but the star and, except for uncredited cameo appearances, had always received top billing.

== Personal life ==
=== Relationship with Hearst ===

In her memoirs, Davies claimed that she and publishing mogul William Randolph Hearst began their sexual relationship when she was a teenage chorus girl. Although they lived together for the next three decades in opulent homes across Southern California and Europe, they never married, because Hearst&#x27;s wife refused to grant him a divorce. At one point, Hearst reportedly came close to marrying Davies, but decided his wife&#x27;s settlement demands were too high. Although he was a notorious philanderer, Hearst was extremely jealous and possessive of Davies, even though he was married throughout their relationship. Lita Grey, Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s second wife, wrote four decades later that Davies confided to her about her relationship with Hearst. Grey quoted Davies as saying:

Despite their well-known jealous attachment to one another, both Davies and Hearst had many sexual liaisons with others while living together in San Simeon and elsewhere. Davies had sexual relationships with fellow actors Charlie Chaplin, Dick Powell, and others, while Hearst had a sexual relationship with blonde chorus girl Maybelle Swor. According to Davies&#x27; friend and confidant Louise Brooks, Davies was particularly incensed by Hearst&#x27;s indiscreet relations with Swor. Davies became irate when Hearst&#x27;s newspapers began openly promoting Swor&#x27;s career in a nearly identical fashion to their earlier promotion of hers.

By the late 1930s, in the wake of the Great Depression, Hearst was suffering financial reversals. After selling many of the contents of St Donat&#x27;s Castle, Davies sold her jewelry, stocks and bonds and wrote a check for $1 million to Hearst to save him from bankruptcy.

=== Alleged biological daughter ===

Since the early 1920s, rumors claimed that Davies and Hearst had a child between 1919 and 1923. In later years, the child was rumored to be Patricia Lake (née Van Cleve), who publicly identified herself as Davies&#x27; niece. On October 3, 1993, Lake died of complications from lung cancer in Indian Wells, California. Shortly before her death, her son claimed that Lake revealed she was the biological daughter of Davies and Hearst. There was never any public comment on her alleged paternity in public, even after Hearst&#x27;s and Davies&#x27; deaths. The claim was published in her newspaper death notice.

According to the rumor, Lake was conceived during Hearst&#x27;s extra-marital affair with Davies and out of wedlock. Hearst sent her to Europe to have the child secretly and avoid a public scandal. Hearst later joined Davies in Europe. Lake claimed she was born in a Catholic hospital outside Paris between 1919 and 1923 and was then given to Davies&#x27; sister Rose, whose own child had died in infancy, and passed off as Rose and her husband George Van Cleve&#x27;s daughter. Lake stated that Hearst paid for her schooling and both Davies and Hearst spent considerable time with her. Davies purportedly told Lake of her true parentage when she was age 11, while Hearst confirmed he was her father on her wedding day at age 17, where both Davies and Hearst gave her away.

However, factual evidence casts doubt on these claims. Lake&#x27;s birth date in 1919 is confirmed by birthday telegrams and photo documentation, and Davies did not go to Europe for the first time until 1922. Davies&#x27; film schedule was very busy in 1919, and she shows no sign of pregnancy in any of them. When responding to the allegation that Lake was the daughter of Davies and Hearst, a spokesman for Hearst Castle commented that, &quot;It&#x27;s a very old rumor and a rumor is all it ever was.&quot;

=== Thomas Ince scandal ===
In November 1924, Davies was among those revelers aboard Hearst&#x27;s steam yacht &quot;Oneida&quot; for a weekend party that culminated in the death of film producer Thomas Ince. Ince purportedly suffered an attack of acute indigestion while aboard the luxury yacht and was escorted off it in San Diego by Hearst&#x27;s studio manager, Dr. Daniel Goodman. Ince was put on a train bound for Los Angeles. When his condition worsened, he was removed from the train at Del Mar. Dr. T. A. Parker and a nurse, Jesse Howard, provided him with medical attention. Ince allegedly told them he had drunk a strong liquor aboard Hearst&#x27;s yacht. He was taken to his Hollywood home where he died.

Following Ince&#x27;s death, rumors became widespread that Hearst had caught Ince &quot;pressing unwelcome attentions on Miss Davies and shot him fatally&quot;. A variant of this rumor alleged that Davies had a sexual liaison with guest Charlie Chaplin, and that Hearst mistook Ince for Chaplin and shot him out of jealousy. Chaplin&#x27;s valet allegedly witnessed Ince being carried from Hearst&#x27;s yacht and claimed that Ince&#x27;s head was &quot;bleeding from a bullet wound&quot;. Screenwriter Elinor Glyn, a fellow guest at the party, claimed &quot;everyone aboard the yacht had been sworn to secrecy, which would hardly have seemed necessary if poor Ince had died of natural causes&quot;. Years later, Chaplin&#x27;s wife Lita Grey repeated claims that Chaplin had sexually pursued Marion Davies aboard Hearst&#x27;s yacht and that a violent altercation had occurred. However, there was never any substantive evidence to support these allegations.

After Ince&#x27;s death, District Attorney Chester C. Kempley of San Diego conducted an inquiry and issued a public statement which declared &quot;the death of Thomas H. Ince was caused by heart failure as a result of an attack of acute indigestion&quot;. Despite the district attorney&#x27;s declaration, and the fact that three physicians and a nurse had attended Ince before he died, the rumors persisted. Consequently, &quot;one can still hear solemn stories in Hollywood today that Ince was murdered&quot; in a jealous dispute over Davies.

== Later years ==
=== Retirement and Hearst&#x27;s death ===
By 1937, Hearst was $126 million in debt (). Consequently, when Hearst&#x27;s Cosmopolitan Pictures folded in 1938, Davies left the film business and retreated to San Simeon. She would later claim in her autobiography that, after many years of work, she had become bored with film acting and decided to devote herself to being Hearst&#x27;s &quot;companion&quot;. However, Davies was intensely ambitious, and she faced the harsh reality at age forty that she could no longer play young heroines, as in her earlier films. Consequently, when drunk at parties in San Simeon, Davies often lamented her retirement and &quot;cursed everyone who felt she had contributed to her ruined career&quot;.

As the years passed, Davies developed a drinking problem, and her alcoholism grew worse in the late 1930s and the 1940s, as she and Hearst lived an increasingly isolated existence. Although Hearst and Davies &quot;were still playing the gracious lord and his lady, and the guests were still responding with grateful expressions of joy,&quot; nevertheless &quot;the life had gone out of their performances&quot;. The two spent most of World War II at Hearst&#x27;s Northern California estate of Wyntoon until returning to San Simeon in 1945.

After a long period of illness, Hearst died on August 14, 1951, age 88. In his will, he provided handsomely for Davies, leaving her 170,000 shares of Hearst Corporation stock, and 30,000 he had put in a trust fund he established for her in 1950. This gave her a controlling interest in the company for a short time, until she chose to relinquish the stock voluntarily to the corporation on October 30, 1951 by selling it to Mrs. Millicent Hearst for one dollar. She retained her original 30,000 shares and an advisory role with the corporation. She soon invested in property and owned The Desert Inn in Palm Springs and several properties in New York City, including the Squibb Building at Fifth Avenue and 58th Street, the Davies Building at E. 57th Street and the Douras Building at E. 55th Street.

=== Marriage to Brown and charity work ===
Following Hearst&#x27;s death, most of Davies&#x27; coterie of hedonistic friends gradually drifted away, and &quot;she relied upon one or two companion-nurses to keep the blues away&quot;. Eleven weeks and one day after Hearst&#x27;s death, Davies married sea captain Horace Brown on October 31, 1951, in Las Vegas. Their union was unhappy. Davies filed for divorce twice, but neither was finalized, despite Brown admitting he treated her badly: &quot;I&#x27;m a beast,&quot; he said. &quot;I took him back. I don&#x27;t know why,&quot; she explained. &quot;I guess because he&#x27;s standing right beside me, crying. Thank God we all have a sense of humor.&quot;

Throughout her later years, Davies was &quot;noted for her kindness&quot; and renowned for her generosity to charities. During the 1920s, she had become interested in children&#x27;s charities, donating over $1 million. In 1952, she donated $1.9 million to establish a children&#x27;s clinic at UCLA, which was named for her. The clinic&#x27;s name was changed to the Mattel Children&#x27;s Hospital in 1998. Davies also fought childhood diseases through the Marion Davies Foundation.

==Illness and death==

In the summer of 1956, after many decades of heavy drinking, Davies had a minor cerebral stroke and was admitted to Cedars of Lebanon Hospital. After the stroke, her Hollywood friends noted that &quot;much of her old spirit and fire were gone&quot;. She quipped to columnist Hedda Hopper that &quot;we blondes seem to be falling apart&quot;. She would never fully regain her health. During this time, many of her friends died, including Louis B. Mayer and Norma Talmadge. Their deaths convinced Davies that she would soon pass away as well.

Three years later, during a dental examination in February 1959, a growth was discovered on her jaw. Not long afterwards, Davies was diagnosed with cancer. Davies made her last public appearance on January 10, 1960, on an NBC television special titled &quot;Hedda Hopper&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;. During this same period, Joseph P. Kennedy rented Davies&#x27; mansion and worked from behind the scenes to secure his son John F. Kennedy&#x27;s nomination during the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. When Joseph P. Kennedy learned Davies was dying of cancer, he &quot;had three cancer specialists flown out&quot; to examine her.

In the spring of 1961, Davies underwent surgery for malignant osteomyelitis. Twelve days after the operation, she fell in her hospital room and broke her leg. Her health failed rapidly over the summer. Davies died of the malignant osteomyelitis on September 22, 1961, in Hollywood. Over 200 mourners and many Hollywood celebrities, including her friends Mary Pickford, Harold Lloyd, Charles &quot;Buddy&quot; Rogers, Glenn Ford, Kay Williams, and Johnny Weissmuller attended her funeral at the Immaculate Heart of Mary Church in Hollywood. Davies was buried in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. She left an estate estimated at $20 million ().

== Cultural legacy ==
=== Susan Alexander Kane ===
According to biographers, the release of Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941) destroyed Davies&#x27; reputation. Film audiences mistakenly assumed Davies was the unalloyed inspiration for the character of Susan Alexander in the film, which was based loosely on Hearst&#x27;s life. Many viewers, including journalists, &quot;assumed that the powerful publisher Charles Kane in the film was Mr. Hearst, the huge castle Xanadu was in reality Mr. Hearst&#x27;s fabulous estate San Simeon and the blonde young singer he tried to turn into a diva, although she had no voice, was in reality Miss Davies&quot;.

Consequently, a myth soon developed that Davies was &quot;not a great actress and the films she made were not among the more impressive or profitable releases&quot;. By the time of her prolonged death from cancer, press obituaries erroneously depicted Davies to have been an extremely mediocre and unpopular actress during her lifetime. However, contrary to the myth, most of Davies&#x27; films made money, and she remained a popular star for most of her career. She was the number one female box office star of 1922–23 because of the enormous popularity of 1922&#x27;s &quot;When Knighthood Was in Flower&quot; and 1923&#x27;s &quot;Little Old New York&quot;, which ranked among the biggest box-office hits of 1922 and 1923, respectively.

Over time, the popular association with the character of Susan Alexander Kane led to later revisionist portrayals of Davies as a talentless opportunist. In his later years, Orson Welles attempted to correct the widespread misconceptions which &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; had created about Davies&#x27; popularity and talents as an actress. In his foreword to Davies&#x27; autobiography, &quot;The Times We Had&quot; (published posthumously in 1975), Welles wrote that the fictional Susan Alexander Kane bears no resemblance to Davies:

Welles told filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich that Samuel Insull&#x27;s construction of the Chicago Opera House, and Harold Fowler McCormick&#x27;s lavish promotion of the opera career of his second wife Ganna Walska, were the actual influences for the Susan Alexander character in the &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; screenplay. &quot;As for Marion,&quot; Welles said, &quot;she was an extraordinary woman—nothing like the character Dorothy Comingore played in the movie ... Marion was much better than Susan—whom people wrongly equated with her&quot;.

=== Critical reassessment ===
Several decades after her death, a critical reassessment of Davies occurred as the result of greater availability of her notable films such as &quot;When Knighthood Was in Flower&quot;, &quot;Beauty&#x27;s Worth&quot;, &quot;The Bride&#x27;s Play&quot;, &quot;Enchantment&quot;, &quot;The Restless Sex&quot;, &quot;April Folly&quot;, and &quot;Buried Treasure&quot;. This availability allowed for a more accurate evaluation of Davies&#x27; as an actress. In the 1970s, film critic Pauline Kael attempted to rehabilitate Davies&#x27; legacy and noted that her reputation had been unfairly maligned. Gradually, the consensus among film critics became more appreciative of her efforts, particularly in comedy. According to biographers, &quot;if Hearst had allowed her great talents as a mime and comic to come to full flower in a long series of comedies as bright as her &quot;Show People&quot; and &quot;The Patsy&quot;, her screen reputation could not have been so readily damaged by the controversy surrounding &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;&quot;.

=== Portrayals of Davies ===

Since her death in 1961, different actresses have portrayed Davies in a variety of media. In 1985, Davies was portrayed by 23-year-old Virginia Madsen in the ABC telefilm &quot;The Hearst and Davies Affair&quot; with Robert Mitchum as Hearst. ABC inaccurately marketed the film as &quot;the scandalous love affair between one of the richest and most powerful men in America and the obscure Ziegfeld girl he promoted to stardom&quot;. To prepare for the role, Madsen &quot;screened Davies&#x27; movies, read books, hunted up a collector of Davies memorabilia and even interviewed the actress&#x27; stand-in&quot;. In the process, Madsen became a Davies fan and said she felt she had inadvertently portrayed her as a stereotype, rather than as a real person. In subsequent decades, Davies was portrayed by Heather McNair in &quot;Chaplin&quot; (1992) and by Gretchen Mol in &quot;Cradle Will Rock&quot; (1999).

The 1999 HBO movie &quot;RKO 281&quot; focuses on the production of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and Hearst&#x27;s efforts to prevent its release, with Melanie Griffith portraying Davies. The movie depicts Davies growing irritated with Hearst&#x27;s lifestyle and political views.

In 2001, director Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s film &quot;The Cat&#x27;s Meow&quot; debuted with 19-year-old Kirsten Dunst starring as Davies. Dunst&#x27;s performance interpreted Davies as &quot;a spoiled ingenue&quot; who was the ambivalent &quot;lover to two very different men&quot;. The film was based upon unsubstantiated rumors concerning the Thomas Ince scandal, which was dramatized in the play &quot;The Cat&#x27;s Meow&quot; and then adapted into the movie. That same year, a documentary film &quot;Captured on Film: The True Story of Marion Davies&quot; (2001) premiered on Turner Classic Movies.

In 2004, the story of William Randolph Hearst and Davies was made into a musical titled &quot;WR and Daisy&quot;, with book and lyrics by Robert and Phyllis White and music by Glenn Paxton. It was performed in 2004 by Theater West, and in 2009 and 2010 at the Annenberg Community Beach House in Santa Monica, California, the estate built by Hearst for Davies in the 1920s.

Amanda Seyfried portrayed Davies in the 2020 Netflix film &quot;Mank&quot; about Herman J. Mankiewicz, the screenwriter of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. Seyfried was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.

In the 2022 film &quot;Babylon&quot;, Davies is portrayed by Chloe Fineman.

<text>Marisa Tomei ( , ; born December 4, 1964) is an American actress. 
She gained prominence for her comedic performance in &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot; (1992), which earned her the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She received further nominations in the category for &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Wrestler&quot; (2008).

Her early appearances were in the soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot; (1983–1985) and the first season of the sitcom &quot;A Different World&quot; (1987). 
Tomei&#x27;s other notable films include &quot;Chaplin&quot; (1992), &quot;&quot; (1994), &quot;What Women Want&quot; (2000), &quot;Before the Devil Knows You&#x27;re Dead&quot; (2007), &quot;Wild Hogs&quot; (2007), &quot;The Wrestler&quot; (2008), &quot;The Ides of March&quot; (2011), &quot;Crazy, Stupid, Love&quot; (2011), &quot;Parental Guidance&quot; (2012), &quot;The Big Short&quot; (2015), and &quot;The King of Staten Island&quot; (2020). She also portrayed May Parker in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, from &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; (2016) to &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021).

Tomei was a founding member of the Naked Angels Theater Company. She appeared in John Morgan Evans&#x27; &quot;Daughters&quot; (1986) off-Broadway before making her Broadway debut in &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot; opposite Quentin Tarantino (1998). She earned a nomination for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play for her role in &quot;Top Girls&quot; (2008), and a special Drama Desk Award for Will Eno&#x27;s &quot;The Realistic Joneses&quot; (2014). She returned to Broadway in the revival of &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; in 2019.

==Early life==
Marisa Tomei was born on December 4, 1964, in Brooklyn, New York City, to Adelaide &quot;Addie&quot; (née Bianchi), an English teacher, and Gary A. Tomei, a trial lawyer. She has a younger brother, actor Adam Tomei, and was partly raised by her paternal grandparents. Tomei&#x27;s parents are both of Italian descent; her father&#x27;s ancestors came from Tuscany, Calabria, and Campania, while her mother&#x27;s ancestors are from Tuscany and Sicily. She graduated from Edward R. Murrow High School in 1982.

Tomei grew up in the Midwood neighborhood of Brooklyn. While there, she became captivated by the Broadway shows to which her theater-loving parents took her and was drawn to acting as a career. At Andries Hudde Junior High School, she played Hedy LaRue in a school production of &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;. She also attended Albee School of Dance. After graduating from high school, she attended Boston University for a year.

==Career==
===1983–1991: Early acting roles ===

Tomei followed up &quot;As the World Turns&quot; in 1987 with a main role on the sitcom &quot;A Different World&quot; as Maggie Lauten during the first season. Her film debut was a minor role in the 1984 comedy film &quot;The Flamingo Kid&quot;, in which she played Mandy, a waitress. She had only one line in the film. In 1986 she had a small role in the Bob and Harvey Weinstein directed comedy film &quot;Playing for Keeps&quot; which was a financial and critical failure. 

During this phase, she made her stage debut in 1987 at the age of 22 in the off-Broadway play &quot;Daughters&quot;, playing Cetta. The role earned her rave reviews and the Theatre World Award for outstanding debut on stage. She continued to take roles off-Broadway in the plays &quot;Beirut&quot; in 1987, &quot;Sharon and Billy&quot; in 1988, and &quot;What the Butler Saw&quot; in 1989. She also portrayed Rosa Delle Rose in &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; at the Williamstown Theatre Festival. She took more prominent roles opposite Sylvester Stallone in the comedy &quot;Oscar&quot; (1991), and Nicolas Cage in the erotic thriller &quot;Zandalee&quot; (1991).

===1992–1999: Breakthrough and acclaim ===
Following several small films, including &quot;Oscar&quot;, Tomei came to international prominence with her comedic performance in the 1992 film &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot; starring opposite Joe Pesci for which she received critical praise. Critic Vincent Canby wrote, &quot;Ms. Tomei gives every indication of being a fine comedian, whether towering over Mr. Pesci and trying to look small, or arguing about a leaky faucet in terms that demonstrate her knowledge of plumbing. Mona Lisa is also a first-rate auto mechanic, which comes in handy in the untying of the knotted story.&quot; For her performance, Tomei was named Best Supporting Actress at the 1993 Academy Awards, prevailing over Miranda Richardson, Joan Plowright, Vanessa Redgrave and Judy Davis.

American film critic Rex Reed created controversy (and a minor Hollywood myth) when he suggested that Jack Palance had announced the wrong name after opening the envelope. While this allegation was repeatedly disproved—even the Academy officially denied it—Tomei called the story &quot;extremely hurtful&quot;. A Price Waterhouse accountant explained that if such an event had occurred, &quot;we have an agreement with the Academy that one of us would step on stage, introduce ourselves, and say the presenter misspoke.&quot; In 2015, when &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; polled hundreds of academy members, asking them to re-vote on some past decisions, Academy members indicated that, given a second chance, they would still award the 1992 Best Supporting Actress award to Tomei.
After her Oscar win, Tomei appeared as silent film star Mabel Normand in the film &quot;Chaplin&quot;, with her then-boyfriend Robert Downey Jr. playing Charlie Chaplin. The following year, she starred in the romantic drama &quot;Untamed Heart&quot; with Christian Slater, for which they won the MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss. Tomei had won the previous year for Best Breakthrough Performance for &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot;. The next year, Tomei played a pregnant journalist in the comedy-drama &quot;The Paper&quot;, and appeared alongside Downey again in the romantic comedy &quot;Only You&quot;. She then appeared in Nick Cassavetes&#x27; &quot;Unhook the Stars&quot;. Of Tomei&#x27;s performance, Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; compared her favorably to the film&#x27;s star, Gena Rowlands, writing, &quot;Ms. Tomei is equally fine as Mildred&#x27;s [Rowlands&#x27; character&#x27;s] younger, hot-tempered neighbor, whose raw working-class feistiness and bluntly profane vocabulary initially repel the genteel older woman.&quot; She received her first Screen Actors Guild award nomination for Outstanding Female Supporting Actor for her performance. 

In 1998, she was nominated for the American Comedy Award for Funniest Supporting Actress for Tamara Jenkins&#x27; cult film &quot;Slums of Beverly Hills&quot;. The independent feature was well received by critics and the public, with Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; writing, &quot;Jenkins makes the most of an especially ingratiating cast, with Ms. Tomei very charming and funny as Rita,&quot; and Emanuel Levy of &quot;Variety&quot; describing Tomei as &quot;spunky and sexy... more subdued than she usually is.&quot; Tomei spent several years away from high-profile roles and major motion pictures in the late 1990s before rising again to prominence in the early 2000s.

During the 1990s, Tomei made several television appearances. In 1996, she made a guest appearance on the sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, playing herself in the two-part episode &quot;The Cadillac&quot;. In the episode, George Costanza attempts to get a date with her through a friend of Elaine Benes. She also made an appearance on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as movie star Sara Sloane, who falls in love with Ned Flanders. Former &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast member Jay Mohr wrote in his book &quot;Gasping for Airtime&quot; that, as guest host in October 1994, Tomei insisted that the proposed sketch &quot;Good Morning Brooklyn&quot; not be used because she did not like the idea of being stereotyped. This displeased SNL&#x27;s writers and performers given the show&#x27;s penchant for satirizing celebrities. Tomei parodied her &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot; role and its considerable Brooklyn influence in a skit spoofing the 1995 O.J. Simpson murder trial. 

In 1998 she made her Broadway debut playing Susy Hendrix in the revival of the Frederick Knott play &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot; acting opposite Quentin Tarantino at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre. Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; compared her performance unfavorably to Audrey Hepburn who played the role in the 1967 film. Brantley wrote, &quot;[Tomei]&#x27;s a fine, vibrant actress, and heaven knows she works hard here, but she isn&#x27;t well cast. The appeal of [Hepburn] in the part was of seeing her fragile, ladylike persona turn tough and muscular, and Ms. Tomei&#x27;s performance allows for no similar transition&quot;. Matt Wolf of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote &quot;Tomei gives a likable, if not wildly interesting performance&quot;.

=== 2000–2009: Established actress ===

Tomei appeared in the Nancy Meyers directed comedy &quot;What Women Want&quot; starring Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt. The film was a commercial success. She also had a supporting role in the romantic comedy &quot;Someone Like You&quot; starring Ashley Judd, Hugh Jackman, and Greg Kinnear.

In 2001, she appeared in Todd Field&#x27;s independent drama film &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; starring Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek. The film earned a Best Picture nomination. Tomei herself earned several awards including a ShoWest Award for Best Supporting Actress in 2002. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Tomei is winning in what is surely her most naturalistic and unaffected performance,&quot; while &quot;The New York Times&quot; writer Stephen Holden exclaimed, &quot;Ms. Tomei&#x27;s ruined, sorrowful Natalie is easily her finest screen role.&quot; &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; earned Tomei a second Academy Award nomination and her first Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Tomei also shared a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Cast. 

In 2002, she appeared in the Bollywood-inspired film &quot;The Guru&quot; and voiced the role of Bree Blackburn, one of the two main antagonists in the animated feature film &quot;The Wild Thornberrys Movie&quot;. In 2003, Tomei appeared in one of her biggest commercial hits the comedy &quot;Anger Management&quot; starring Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler. The following year, she appeared in the film &quot;Alfie&quot; with Jude Law, based on the 1966 British film of the same name. In 2006, Tomei had a recurring role in &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, playing Johnny Gavin&#x27;s ex-wife Angie. She won a Gracie Allen Award for Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her work in the four episodes in which she appeared. The following year, she appeared in the comedy &quot;Wild Hogs&quot; (2007). The film was the 13th-highest-grossing movie of 2007 ($168,273,550 domestic box office).

In 2008, Tomei played Cassidy/Pam, a struggling stripper, in the Darren Aronofsky film &quot;The Wrestler&quot;. She appeared in several nude dance numbers in the film. Aronofsky said, &quot;This role shows how courageous and brave Marisa is. And ultimately she&#x27;s really sexy. We knew nudity was a big part of the picture, and she wanted to be that exposed and vulnerable.&quot; Numerous critics heralded this performance as a standout in her career. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote, &quot;Tomei delivers one of her most arresting performances, again without any trace of vanity.&quot; Ty Burr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote, &quot;Tomei gives a brave and scrupulously honest performance, one that&#x27;s most naked when Pam has her clothes on.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; exclaimed, &quot;Tomei is in top, emotionally forthright form as she charts a life passage similar to Pam&#x27;s.&quot; For her performance she was nominated for her first BAFTA, second Golden Globe and third Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. In 2009, Tomei recorded the role of Mary Magdalene in Thomas Nelson&#x27;s audio Bible production &quot;The Word of Promise&quot;.
===2010–present===
In 2010, Tomei appeared in &quot;Cyrus&quot;, a comedy-drama co-starring John C. Reilly and Jonah Hill. Tomei hosted the 2011 Scientific and Technical Awards, which was followed by an appearance at the 83rd Academy Awards. She starred in the mystery-suspense film &quot;The Lincoln Lawyer&quot;. She also appeared in &quot;Salvation Boulevard&quot;, which premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. Tomei&#x27;s other 2011 films included &quot;Crazy, Stupid, Love&quot; and the George Clooney film &quot;The Ides of March&quot;. The same year, Lady Gaga said in an interview she would want Tomei to portray her in a film about the singer. Tomei responded, &quot;I was thrilled when I heard. I love her. I love her music. And she&#x27;s an awesome businesswoman. So I was so touched, really. I think it&#x27;s incredible that she likes my work and that she&#x27;d think of me.&quot;

Tomei was featured in the second episode of the third season of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, on February 10, 2012. In the episode, she traveled to Tuscany and to the island of Elba to uncover the truth about the 100-year-old murder of her great-grandfather, Francesco Leopoldo Bianchi. Tomei portrayed a single mom back in school at Binghamton University taking a class taught by Hugh Grant in Marc Lawrence’s 2014 written and directed &quot;The Rewrite&quot;. She also starred in the Ira Sachs drama &quot;Love Is Strange&quot; (2014) alongside Alfred Molina and John Lithgow. That same year she appeared on Broadway in the Will Eno play &quot;The Realistic Joneses&quot; starring alongside Tracy Letts, Michael C. Hall, and Toni Collette. Charles Isherwood of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Ms. Tomei radiates chipper energy...[with] an air of desperate cheeriness that keeps faltering, like a sparkler sputtering in the dark.&quot;

During this time she portrayed Aunt May in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, appearing in &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; (2016), &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; (2017), &quot;&quot; (2019), &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot; (2019) and &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021). 
She also took roles in the crime drama &quot;The Big Short&quot; (2015), the horror film &quot;The First Purge&quot; (2018), the comedy-drama &quot;The King of Staten Island&quot; (2020). Tomei returned to Broadway in the revival of &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; at the American Airlines Theatre. She reprised the role of Serafina Delle Rose which she previously played off-Broadway. Alexis Soloski of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;Past productions have starred actors with a heft of gravitas – Anna Magnani, Mercedes Ruehl, Maureen Stapleton – women who may have given the gags somewhere weightier to land. Tomei is a lighter, flightier presence – sensuous and delightful – and she plays even the darkest moments brightly, in on the joke.&quot;

In 2018 she had a guest spot in the second season of the Hulu dystopian series &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; playing Mrs. O&#x27;Connor. 
She was also cast to play &quot;All in the Family&quot;’s Edith Bunker in ABC’s &quot;Live in Front of a Studio Audience&quot; specials in 2019 and 2020.

She appeared in Céline&#x27;s fall 2014 campaign, and has also appeared in campaigns for Briggs &amp; Riley and Coach, Band of Outsiders.

==Personal life==
Between 2008 and 2012, Tomei was in a relationship with actor Logan Marshall-Green. They were rumored to be engaged, but a representative for Tomei denied this. To date, Tomei has never been married. Tomei said in 2009, &quot;I&#x27;m not that big a fan of marriage as an institution, and I don&#x27;t know why women need to have children to be seen as complete human beings.&quot;

<text>Chloë Stevens Sevigny ( ; born November 18, 1974) is an American actress. Known for her work in independent films, often appearing in controversial or experimental features, Sevigny is the recipient of several accolades, including a Golden Globe Award, as well as a nomination for an Academy Award.

After graduating from high school, Sevigny found work as a model, and appeared in music videos for Sonic Youth and The Lemonheads, which helped acquire her &quot;it girl&quot; status. In 1995, she made her film debut in &quot;Kids&quot;, and became a prominent performer in the independent film scene throughout the late 1990s, with roles in such films as 1996&#x27;s &quot;Trees Lounge&quot;. Sevigny rose to prominence with her portrayal of Lana Tisdel in the drama film &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; (1999), for which she received a nomination for the Academy Award For Best Supporting Actress.

Throughout the 2000s, Sevigny appeared in supporting parts in numerous independent films, including &quot;American Psycho&quot; (2000), &quot;Demonlover&quot; (2002); &quot;Party Monster&quot; and &quot;Dogville&quot; (both 2003); and &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; (2004). Her participation in the latter caused considerable controversy due to a scene in which she performed graphic unsimulated fellatio. From 2006 to 2011, Sevigny portrayed Nicolette Grant on the HBO series &quot;Big Love&quot;, for which she won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in 2010. She also appeared in mainstream films such as David Fincher&#x27;s &quot;Zodiac&quot; (2007), and starred in numerous television projects, including the British series &quot;Hit &amp; Miss&quot; (2012), and having supporting roles in &quot;Portlandia&quot; (2013), two seasons of &quot;American Horror Story&quot;; and in the Netflix series &quot;Bloodline&quot; (2015–2017) and &quot;&quot; (2024). 

Sevigny made her directorial debut in 2016 with the short film &quot;Kitty&quot;. Her third film as a director, a short titled &quot;White Echo&quot;, competed for the Short Film Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. She also has a career in fashion design concurrent with her acting work. Over the years, her alternative fashion sense has earned her a reputation as a style icon.

==Early life ==
Chloe Stevens Sevigny was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, on November 18, 1974, the second child of Janine () and Harold David Sevigny (1940–1996). She has one older brother, Paul, who is a member of the band A.R.E. Weapons. According to Sevigny, she added the diaeresis to her first name later in life, and it was not on her birth certificate. Her mother is Polish-American, and her father was of French-Canadian heritage. Sevigny and her brother were raised in a strict Catholic household in affluent Darien, Connecticut, where her father worked first as an accountant, and then as an art teacher. Despite Darien&#x27;s wealth, the Sevignys had a &quot;frugal&quot; household, and were considered &quot;the poor bohemians in [an] extremely prosperous neighborhood&quot;. Sevigny has stated that her father &quot;worked very hard to bring us up in that town ... He wanted us to grow up in a really safe environment.&quot;

As a child, Sevigny was diagnosed with scoliosis, but never received any surgical treatment for it. She often spent summers attending theater camp, with leading roles in plays run by the YMCA. She attended Darien High School, where she was a member of the Alternative Learning Program. While in high school, she often babysat actor Topher Grace and his younger sister. As a young teenager, she worked sweeping the tennis courts of a country club her family could not afford to join.

Sevigny described herself as a &quot;loner&quot; and a &quot;depressed teenager&quot; whose only extracurricular activities were occasionally skateboarding with her older brother and sewing her own clothes. In high school, she grew rebellious and began experimenting with drugs, particularly hallucinogens. She has said that her father was aware of her experimentation, and even told her that it was okay, but that she had &quot;to stop if she had bad trips&quot;. Despite her father&#x27;s leniency, her mother forced her to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. 

Sevigny later stated about her teenage drug use that &quot;I had a great family lifeI would never want it to look as if it reflected on them. I think I was very bored ... I often feel it&#x27;s because I experimented when I was younger that I have no interest as an adult. I know a lot of adults who didn&#x27;t, and it&#x27;s much more dangerous when you start experimenting with drugs as an adult.&quot; Sevigny&#x27;s father died of cancer in 1996, when she was 22 years old.

==Career==
=== 1992–1994: Modeling ===
As a teenager, Sevigny would occasionally ditch school in Darien and take the train into Manhattan. In 1992, at age 17, she was spotted on an East Village street by Andrea Linett, a fashion editor of &quot;Sassy&quot; magazine, who was so impressed by her style that she asked her to model for the magazine; she was later made an intern. When recounting the event, Sevigny recalled that Linett &quot;just liked the hat I was wearing.&quot; She later modeled in the magazine as well as for X-Girl, the subsidiary fashion label of the Beastie Boys&#x27; &quot;X-Large&quot;, designed by Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, which she followed with an appearance in the music video for Sonic Youth&#x27;s &quot;Sugar Kane&quot;.

In 1993, at age 19, Sevigny relocated from her Connecticut hometown to an apartment in Brooklyn, and worked as a seamstress. During that time, author Jay McInerney spotted her around New York City and wrote a seven-page article about her for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in which he dubbed her the new &quot;it girl&quot; and referred to her as one of the &quot;coolest girls in the world.&quot; She subsequently appeared on the album cover of Gigolo Aunts&#x27; 1994 recording &quot;Flippin&#x27; Out&quot; and the EP &quot;Full-On Bloom&quot;, as well as in a Lemonheads music video, which further increased her reputation on New York&#x27;s early 1990s underground scene.

=== 1995–1998: Early film and stage roles ===
Sevigny met screenwriter and aspiring director Harmony Korine in Washington Square Park during her senior year of high school in 1993. The two became close friends, which resulted in her being cast in the low-budget independent film &quot;Kids&quot; (1995), which was written by Korine and directed by Larry Clark. Sevigny played a New York teenager who discovers she is HIV positive. According to Sevigny, she was originally cast in a much smaller role, but ended up replacing Canadian actress Mia Kirshner. Just two days before production began, the leading role went to Sevigny, who was 19 at the time and had no professional acting experience. 

&quot;Kids&quot; was highly controversial. The film was given an NC-17 rating by the Motion Picture Association of America for its graphic depiction of sexuality and drug use involving teenagers. Despite this, the film was taken note of critically. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; considered it a &quot;wake-up call to the modern world&quot; about the nature of the American youth in contemporary urban settings. Sevigny&#x27;s performance was praised, with critics noting that she brought a tenderness to the chaotic, immoral nature of the film: &quot;Sevigny provided the warm, reflective centre in this feral film.&quot; She received an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Supporting Female.

In 1996, Sevigny starred in actor/director Steve Buscemi&#x27;s independent film &quot;Trees Lounge&quot;, in a relatively small role as Buscemi&#x27;s object of affection. During this time, director Mary Harron, after having seen &quot;Kids&quot;, offered Sevigny a minor part in her film &quot;I Shot Andy Warhol&quot; (1996). Harron tracked Sevigny down to the SoHo clothing store Liquid Sky, where she was working at the time. Sevigny then gave her first audition ever, but ultimately decided to turn down the part. She later worked with Harron on &quot;American Psycho&quot; (2000). Instead of taking the part in &quot;I Shot Andy Warhol&quot;, Sevigny starred in and worked as a fashion designer on &quot;Gummo&quot; (1997), directed and written by Harmony Korine, who was romantically involved with Sevigny during and after filming. 

&quot;Gummo&quot; was as controversial as Sevigny&#x27;s debut; set in Xenia, Ohio, the film depicts an array of nihilistic characters in a poverty-stricken community, and presents themes of drug and sexual abuse as well as anti-social alienated youth. Recalling the film, Sevigny cited it as one of her favorite projects: &quot;Young people love that movie. It&#x27;s been stolen from every Blockbuster in America. It&#x27;s become a cult film&quot;. The film was dedicated to Sevigny&#x27;s father, who died prior to the film&#x27;s release.

In 1998, Sevigny starred in the neo-noir thriller &quot;Palmetto&quot;, playing a young Florida kidnapee alongside Woody Harrelson. Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; lambasted the film for having &quot;bad writing,&quot; ultimately deeming it &quot;somewhat dull and sluggish.&quot; She then had a leading role as a Hampshire College graduate in the sardonic period piece &quot;The Last Days of Disco&quot; (1998), alongside Kate Beckinsale. The film was written and directed by cult director Whit Stillman and details the rise and fall of the Manhattan club scene in the early 1980s. Stillman said of Sevigny: &quot;Chloë is a natural phenomenon. You&#x27;re not directing, she&#x27;s not performing—it&#x27;s just real.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Sevigny &quot;is seductively demure&quot; in her performance as Alice. The film was generally well received, but was not a box-office success in the United States, only grossing $3 million—it has since become somewhat of a success as a cult film.

Aside from film work, Sevigny starred in a 1998 Off-Broadway production of &quot;Hazelwood Jr. High&quot;, which tells the true story of the 1992 murder of Shanda Sharer. Sevigny played 17-year-old Laurie Tackett, one of four girls responsible for torturing and murdering 12-year-old Sharer. Sevigny stated she was so emotionally disturbed after playing the role that she began attending Mass again.

=== 1999–2003: &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; and breakthrough ===
In 1999, Sevigny was cast in the independent drama &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; after director Kimberly Peirce saw her performance in &quot;The Last Days of Disco&quot;. Sevigny&#x27;s role in &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;—a biographical film of trans man Brandon Teena, who was raped and murdered in Humboldt, Nebraska in 1993—was responsible for her rise to prominence and her mainstream success. Sevigny played Lana Tisdel, a young woman who fell in love with Teena, initially unaware of the fact that he was a transgender man and continued the relationship after learning about his gender identity. &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; received high praise from critics, and was a moderate box-office success. 

The film was widely credited as featuring some of the best acting of the year, with Sevigny&#x27;s performance widely praised. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated that she &quot;plays the role with haunting immediacy&quot;, Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; stated that &quot;it is Sevigny who provides our entrance into the story&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that she gives a &quot;performance that burns into the memory&quot;. The role earned Sevigny supporting actress nominations for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award. She won an Independent Spirit Award, a Satellite Award, and a Sierra Award for her performance.

In 1999, Sevigny appeared in the experimental film &quot;Julien Donkey-Boy&quot;, which reunited her with writer-director Harmony Korine. In the film, she played the pregnant sister of a man with schizophrenia. Though it never saw a major theatrical release, the film garnered some critical praise; Roger Ebert gave the film his signature thumbs up, referring to it as &quot;&quot;Freaks&quot; shot by the &quot;Blair Witch&quot; crew&quot;, and continuing to say, &quot;The odds are good that most people will dislike this film and be offended by it. For others, it will provoke sympathy rather than scorn&quot;. Sevigny also had a small part in the drama film &quot;A Map of the World&quot; (1999), which starred Sigourney Weaver.

In 2000, Sevigny played a supporting role in Mary Harron&#x27;s &quot;American Psycho&quot;, based on the 1991 novel by Bret Easton Ellis. She portrayed the office assistant of the main character Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), a 1980s Manhattan yuppie-turned-serial killer. Similarly to the novel on which it was based, the film was controversial because of its depiction of graphic violence and sexuality in an upper-class Manhattan society. Sevigny also appeared as a lesbian in the Emmy Award-winning television film &quot;If These Walls Could Talk 2&quot; (2000), the sequel to the HBO television drama-film &quot;If These Walls Could Talk&quot; (1996). Sevigny credited it as the only film she ever made for financial benefit, to help her mother with whom she lived in Connecticut in 1998–2000.

Following her appearance in &quot;If These Walls Could Talk 2&quot;, Sevigny was approached for a supporting role in the comedy &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; alongside Reese Witherspoon and offered $500,000; she declined and the role was given to Selma Blair. Instead, she starred in Olivier Assayas&#x27; French techno thriller &quot;Demonlover&quot; (2002) alongside Connie Nielsen, for which she was required to learn her lines in French. Sevigny described shooting the film as &quot;strange&quot;, in the sense that Assayas hardly spoke to her during the filming, which she said was difficult because of the lack of &quot;input&quot;. After spending nearly three months in France to complete &quot;Demonlover&quot;, Sevigny returned to New York to film the Club Kids biopic &quot;Party Monster&quot; (2003). She knew several of the people depicted in the film, including Michael Alig and James St. James, whom she had met during her frequent trips to New York City&#x27;s club scene as a teenager.

Around 2002, Sevigny began collaborating with friend Tara Subkoff for the Imitation of Christ fashion label and conceptual art project, with their first collection being released in 2003. She served as the creative director for the line, which was referred to as being &quot;more about performance art and cultural theory than clothes&quot;. In film, Sevigny had a role in Lars von Trier&#x27;s parable &quot;Dogville&quot; (2003), playing one of the various residents of a small mountain town, alongside Nicole Kidman, Lauren Bacall, and Paul Bettany. The film received mixed reactions, and was criticized by Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper as being &quot;anti-American&quot;. 

In 2003, she re-united with former &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; star Peter Sarsgaard for the biographical film &quot;Shattered Glass&quot;, also alongside Hayden Christensen, about the career of Stephen Glass, a journalist whose reputation is destroyed when his widespread journalistic fraud is exposed. Sevigny played Caitlin Avey, one of Glass&#x27; co-editors.

=== 2004–2006: &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; controversy ===

In 2003, Sevigny played the lead female role in the art house film &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; (2003), which details a lonely traveling motorcycle racer reminiscing about his former lover. The film included a scene that involves Sevigny performing unsimulated fellatio on star and director Vincent Gallo, who had been her boyfriend in real life. The film premiered at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival and opened to significant controversy and criticism from audiences and critics. Additionally, a promotional billboard erected over Sunset Boulevard, which depicted a censored still from the film&#x27;s final scene, garnered further attention and criticism. Sevigny defended the film: In an interview with &quot;The Telegraph&quot; in 2003, when asked if she regretted the film, she responded: 

Despite the backlash toward the film, some critics praised Sevigny&#x27;s performance, including Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot;: Roger Ebert, although critical of &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot;, nevertheless said that Sevigny brought &quot;a truth and vulnerability&quot; to the film.
Sevigny continued on with various projects. She had a major supporting role in Woody Allen&#x27;s two-sided tragicomedy &quot;Melinda and Melinda&quot; (2004). Critic Peter Bradshaw described the film as &quot;strange... a half-hearted experiment populated by undernourished lab rats.&quot; She guest-starred on the popular television show &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, and played small roles in Lars von Trier&#x27;s &quot;Manderlay&quot; (2005) (a sequel to &quot;Dogville&quot; (2003)) and in Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Broken Flowers&quot; (2005). 

She played one of the several lovers of New York doctor Herman Tarnower in the HBO television film &quot;Mrs. Harris&quot; (2005) alongside Annette Bening and Ben Kingsley. In &quot;3 Needles&quot; (2005), an anthology film about AIDS in various parts of the world, Sevigny had a major role as a Catholic nun visiting Africa. Her performance received good reviews; Dennis Harvey of &quot;Variety&quot; called her &quot;convincing&quot;, while Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; referred to her as &quot;ever-daring and shrewd.&quot; 

In 2006, Sevigny played the lead character in the experimental indie-film &quot;Lying&quot; (2006) with Jena Malone and Leelee Sobieski, portraying a pathological liar who gathers three female acquaintances for a weekend at her upstate New York country house; the film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2006. She had a starring role in Douglas Buck&#x27;s 2006 remake of the Brian De Palma horror film &quot;Sisters&quot; (1973), playing a journalist who witnesses a murder.

=== 2007–2011: Fashion endeavors; &quot;Big Love&quot; ===

In 2006, Sevigny began a five-season run in the HBO television series &quot;Big Love&quot;, about a family of fundamentalist Mormon polygamists. She played Nicolette Grant, the conniving, shopaholic daughter of a cult leader and second wife to a polygamist husband, played by Bill Paxton. Sevigny also appeared in her first big-budget production, playing Robert Graysmith&#x27;s wife Melanie in David Fincher&#x27;s &quot;Zodiac&quot; (2007), based on the Zodiac Killer criminal case.

In October 2007, the French fashion house Chloé announced that Sevigny would be one of the spokesmodels for its new fragrance. Sevigny also released a clothing collection for Opening Ceremony in the fall of 2009. It included men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, and unisex pieces, and received mixed reactions from critics. Sevigny returned to films in 2009, starring in the independent psychological thriller &quot;The Killing Room&quot;, and Werner Herzog&#x27;s &quot;My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done&quot;, a crime horror film based on murderer Mark Yavorsky, produced by David Lynch.

In January 2010, Sevigny won a Golden Globe award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film for her performance in the third season of &quot;Big Love&quot;. During a press conference following the award win, Sevigny addressed the repressed women living in the fundamentalist Mormon compounds: &quot;These women are kept extremely repressed. They should be helped. They don&#x27;t even know who the president of the United States is.&quot; 

In a later interview with The A.V. Club, Sevigny was asked if she felt that the show&#x27;s message was that polygamy was &quot;wrong&quot;. In response, Sevigny stated: &quot;No, absolutely not. I think there are more parallels to gay rights and alternative lifestyles within &quot;Big Love&quot;—more so than &#x27;Polygamy is wrong&#x27;. I think they actually condone people who decide to live this lifestyle outside of fundamentalist sects.&quot; During the same interview, Sevigny stated her disappointment with the series&#x27; fourth season, calling it &quot;awful&quot; and &quot;very telenovela&quot;—though she stated that she loves her character and the writing, she felt the show &quot;got away from itself.&quot; 

Sevigny later regretted making the statements, saying she was very &quot;exhausted&quot; and &quot;wasn&#x27;t thinking about what [she] was saying&quot;; she also apologized to the show&#x27;s producers. &quot;[I didn&#x27;t want them to think] that I was biting the hand that feeds me, because I obviously love the show and have always been nothing but positive about it. And I didn&#x27;t want anybody to misunderstand me or think that I wasn&#x27;t, you know, appreciative.&quot;

While starring in the fourth season of &quot;Big Love&quot; in 2010, Sevigny also appeared major roles in two independent comedy films: &quot;Barry Munday&quot; and &quot;Mr. Nice&quot;. In &quot;Munday&quot;, she played the sister of a homely woman who is expecting a child by a recently castrated womanizer (opposite Patrick Wilson and Judy Greer). Her role in &quot;Mr. Nice&quot;, as the wife of British marijuana-trafficker Howard Marks, had Sevigny starring alongside Rhys Ifans; the film was based on Marks&#x27; autobiography of the same name. Sevigny also had a voice part in the documentary film &quot;Beautiful Darling&quot; (2010), narrating the life of Warhol superstar Candy Darling through Darling&#x27;s diaries and personal letters. The fifth and final season of &quot;Big Love&quot; premiered in January 2011.

=== 2012–2015: Television projects ===

In 2012, Sevigny starred in the British miniseries &quot;Hit &amp; Miss&quot;, playing a transgender contract killer. Mike Hale of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of her performance: &quot;Her naturally deep voice is a plus, and her characteristic mix of loucheness and gravity makes sense here, though it&#x27;s less interesting in this role than it was in the bitterly voracious wife she played in &quot;Big Love&quot;.&quot; The same year, Sevigny guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, and also appeared in the second and fifth seasons of &quot;American Horror Story&quot;, which premiered in October 2012 and the latter in October 2015.

Sevigny appeared in a supporting role as a journalist in &quot;Lovelace&quot; (2013), a biographical film about pornographic film actress Linda Lovelace. The year also saw the release of &quot;The Wait&quot; (2013), Sevigny&#x27;s second collaboration with director M. Blash, in which she starred alongside Jena Malone and Luke Grimes. It was a psychological thriller about two sisters who decide to keep their recently deceased mother in their house after receiving a phone call that she will be resurrected. Sevigny also had roles in television, appearing as a satellite character in the third season of the television sketch comedy show &quot;Portlandia&quot;, and having a 5-episode guest role on the comedy series &quot;The Mindy Project&quot;, in which she portrayed the ex-wife of the titular Mindy&#x27;s love interest (played by Chris Messina). Kristi Turnquist of &quot;The Oregonian&quot; praised Sevigny in &quot;Portlandia&quot;, stating that she &quot;instantly adds dimension and interest&quot; to the series.

In 2014, Sevigny starred as Catherine Jensen in the crime drama &quot;Those Who Kill&quot;, which aired on the A&amp;E Network. After being pulled from A&amp;E after two episodes due to low ratings, it was then re-launched on A&amp;E&#x27;s sister network, Lifetime Movie Network. The series was subsequently cancelled after its 10 episode first season run. During the 29th International Festival of Fashion and Photography in April 2014, Sevigny served as a judge of the fashion jury, along with Humberto Leon and Carol Lim.
In March 2015, it was announced Sevigny would be returning to &quot;American Horror Story&quot; for its fifth season, &quot;Hotel&quot;, as a main cast member. Sevigny portrayed a doctor whose son has been kidnapped. That same year, she also starred in the Netflix original series &quot;Bloodline&quot;. In the spring of 2015, Sevigny published a picture book chronicling her life, containing photos of her as a high school student, on film sets, personal scripts, and other ephemera. She also appeared in Tara Subkoff&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;#Horror&quot;, playing the opulent mother of a teenage girl whose get-together with friends is interrupted by a murderer.

=== 2016–present: Directing and other projects ===

In early 2016, Sevigny appeared in the Canadian horror film &quot;Antibirth&quot; opposite Natasha Lyonne, which follows a small-town woman who becomes pregnant through unknown circumstances. Sevigny reunited with &quot;The Last Days of Disco&quot; director and fellow actresses Whit Stillman and Kate Beckinsale on &quot;Love &amp; Friendship&quot;, an adaptation of the Jane Austen novel &quot;Lady Susan&quot;. Both films premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2016. In 2016 and 2017, respectively, Sevigny also reprised her role in &quot;Bloodline&quot;, becoming a main cast member in the third and final season.

Sevigny made her directorial debut in 2016 with the short film &quot;Kitty&quot;, which she adapted from Paul Bowles&#x27; 1980 short story. The film was selected to close the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, and was subsequently acquired by The Criterion Collection, which made it available for streaming on their user subscription channel. In late 2016, Sevigny directed her second short film, &quot;Carmen&quot;, which was shot on location in Portland, Oregon. The film, released as part of a Miu Miu campaign, focuses on comedian Carmen Lynch.

Sevigny played supporting parts in multiple films in 2017. She co-starred as a horse jockey in the drama &quot;Lean on Pete&quot;, based on the novel by Willy Vlautin; in the ensemble drama &quot;Golden Exits&quot;; the comedy-drama &quot;Beatriz at Dinner&quot;, about a Latina massage therapist who is invited to a dinner held by her wealthy employers; the drama &quot;The Dinner&quot;, concerning a dinner between two couples recounting their children&#x27;s involvement in a murder; and &quot;The Snowman&quot; (2017), where she played the twin sisters, one of whom was killed by a serial killer.

Sevigny starred as Lizzie Borden in &quot;Lizzie&quot; (2018), which premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival, co-starring with Kristen Stewart. Sevigny had first expressed interest in developing and starring in a miniseries based on Borden in 2011. Michael O&#x27;Sullivan of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that Sevigny &quot;is something of a closed book, delivering a stolid performance that can be read as either strong-willed or stonyhearted.&quot; Sevigny also appeared in a supporting role in &quot;The True Adventures of Wolfboy&quot;, and starred as a small-town police officer facing a zombie apocalypse in Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s comedy horror film &quot;The Dead Don&#x27;t Die&quot; (2019). The latter film premiered as the opening feature at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, where Sevigny&#x27;s third short film, &quot;White Echo&quot;, also competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or for Best Short Film.

In 2019 (and 2022), Sevigny appeared in the Netflix show &quot;Russian Doll&quot;, portraying the mother of the lead character. In 2023, she was a guest star in the Peacock show &quot;Poker Face&quot;, working again with Natasha Lyonne, star of both series. In 2020, Sevigny starred in &quot;We Are Who We Are&quot;, a limited series directed by Luca Guadagnino, which premiered in September 2020 on HBO.

In 2024, Sevigny appeared in a Charli XCX music video called &quot;360&quot;. In the same year she starred as socialite C. Z. Guest in the Ryan Murphy anthology &quot;&quot; which premiered on FX in January, and in Murphy&#x27;s Netflix television drama &quot;&quot; as Kitty Menendez, mother of Lyle and Erik Menendez.

== Legacy and influence ==

Sevigny has long been considered a fashion icon and regularly appears alternately on both best- and worst-dressed lists. Commenting on criticisms of her fashion choices, she said in 2015: &quot;I called my great aunt who lives in Florida over Christmas. I hadn&#x27;t seen her in a while and she said, &#x27;Oh, I never get to see you [in person] but I always see you in the back of &quot;US Weekly&quot;. They&#x27;re always making fun of you,&#x27; and I was like, &#x27;You know me, I dress crazy.&#x27; It makes me feel bad.&quot;

Throughout her career, she has modelled for several high-profile designers, including Miu Miu, Louis Vuitton, Chloé, H&amp;M, Proenza Schouler, Kenzo and Vivienne Westwood. Prior to her career as an actress, she had achieved fame for her unique style. While her sense of style in the early 1990s reflected only small downtown scenes and trends, it still made a significant impression on high class fashion chains, which began to emulate Sevigny&#x27;s look. Her interest in fashion and clothing, as well as her career as a fashion model in her late teenage years and early twenties, have led to a career as a prominent and well-respected fashion designer.

She has expressed interest in fashion design throughout the entirety of her career, even dating back to her childhood: &quot;&quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; was my favorite show. I would only wear calico print dresses, and I actually slept in one of those little nightcaps!&quot;, she told &quot;People&quot; in 2007. Her unorthodox style, which garnered her initial notoriety in the early &#x27;90s, has often been referred to as eclectic. Sevigny has since released several clothing lines designed by herself, both solo and in collaboration, and has earned a title as a modern fashion icon. 

In 2023, she held a clothing sale in New York, selling &quot;over 90 percent&quot; of her clothes that had been held in storage. The proceeds reportedly went to storage and charity. &quot;Vogue&quot; noted that the success of the sale marked the continuation of Sevigny&#x27;s &quot;it girl&quot; reputation, though Sevigny had indicated recently that she no longer identified with the label.
Critical reception of her fashion and style has been extensively written about by both designers and fashion stylists and has generally proved favorable. American designer Marc Jacobs wrote of Sevigny in 2001: &quot;The fashion world is fascinated by her. Because not only is she talented, young and attractive, she stands out in a sea of often clichéd looking actresses.&quot; In terms of her own personal style, Sevigny cited the Australian film &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; (1975), which features schoolgirls dressed in elaborate Victorian clothing, as a major inspiration; she has also cited it as one of her favorite films. 

She has been outspoken in her favoritism of vintage clothing over designer pieces: &quot;I still prefer to buy vintage over spending it all on one designer&quot;, she told &quot;The Times&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;ll go to Resurrection or Decades and be like, &#x27;Oh, I&#x27;m going to buy everything,&#x27; but a lot of it is extremely expensive, so I&#x27;ll go to Wasteland and satisfy that urge and it&#x27;s not too hard on the pocketbook. Then there&#x27;s this place called Studio Wardrobe Department where everything is like three dollars&quot;.

Actor Drew Droege has, since 2011, performed in a web series titled &quot;Chloë&quot;, featuring Droege&#x27;s drag impersonation of Sevigny.

== Political views ==
Sevigny endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for President in the 2016 US presidential election and again in the 2020 election.

== Personal life ==
In the late 1990s, Sevigny dated British singer Jarvis Cocker. She later said witnessing his experience as a pop star impacted her view of celebrity and career goals:

Around 2000, Sevigny began a relationship with musician Matt McAuley of the band A.R.E. Weapons. They were a couple for eight years before separating in early 2008.

Sevigny began dating Croatian art gallery director Siniša Mačković in 2018. They married on March 9, 2020, and on May 2, 2020, she gave birth to a son. She is Catholic and attends church.

<doc id="219364" wikidata="Q2720142" url="?curid=219364" title="Convention (political norm)">
<text>A convention, also known as a constitutional convention, is an uncodified tradition that is followed by the institutions of a state. In some states, notably those Commonwealth states that follow the Westminster system and whose political systems derive from British constitutional law, most government functions are guided by constitutional convention rather than by a formal written constitution. In these states, actual distribution of power may be markedly different from those the formal constitutional documents describe. In particular, the formal constitution often confers wide discretionary powers on the head of state that, in practice, are used only on the advice of the head of government, and in some cases not at all.

Some constitutional conventions operate separately from or alongside written constitutions, such as in Canada since the country was formed with the enactment of the Constitution Act, 1867. In others, notably the United Kingdom, which lack a single overarching constitutional document, unwritten conventions are still of vital importance in understanding how the state functions. In most states, however, many old conventions have been replaced or superseded by laws (called codification).

Historical entities often had strong emphasis on constitutional convention. For example the constitution of the Roman Republic was codified comparatively late in its development and relied for its functioning on traditions and a shared moral code called mos maiorum. In the Holy Roman Empire such important issues as who could elect the emperor were entirely uncodified before the Golden Bull of 1356 and remained subject to a certain degree of interpretation well afterwards.

==Definitions==
The term was first used by British legal scholar A. V. Dicey in his 1883 book, &quot;Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution&quot;. Dicey wrote that in Britain, the actions of political actors and institutions are governed by two parallel and complementary sets of rules:

A century later, Canadian scholar Peter Hogg wrote:

==Origins==

Constitutional conventions arise when the exercise of a certain type of power, which is not prohibited by law, arouses such opposition that it becomes impossible, on future occasions, to engage in further exercises of this power. For example, the constitutional convention that the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom cannot remain in office without the support of a majority of members of the House of Commons is derived from an unsuccessful attempt by the ministry of Robert Peel to govern without the support of a majority in the House, in 1834–1835.

==Enforceability in the courts==

Constitutional conventions are not, and cannot be, enforced by courts of law. The primary reason for this, according to the Supreme Court of Canada in its 1981 Patriation Reference, is that, &quot;They are generally in conflict with the legal rules which they postulate and the courts may be bound to enforce the legal rules.&quot; More precisely, the conventions make certain acts, which would be permissible under a straightforward reading of the law, impermissible in practice. The court ruled that this conflict between convention and law means that no convention, no matter how well-established or universally accepted, can &quot;crystallize&quot; into law, unless the relevant parliament or legislature enacts a law or constitutional amendment codifying that convention. This principle is regarded as authoritative in a number of other jurisdictions, including the UK.

Some conventions evolve or change over time. For example, before 1918 the British Cabinet requested a parliamentary dissolution from the monarch, with the Prime Minister conveying the request. Between 1918 and 2011, Prime Ministers requested dissolutions on their own initiative, and were not required to consult members of the Cabinet (although, at the very least, it would have been unusual for the Cabinet not to be aware of the Prime Minister&#x27;s intention). In 2024 Prime Minister Rishi Sunak reportedly announced his intention to hold an early election in July 2024 without even informing most of his cabinet prior to the announcement.

However, conventions are rarely ever broken. Unless there is general agreement on the breach, the person who breaches a convention is often heavily criticised, on occasions leading to a loss of respect or popular support.

==Examples==

===Australia===
* Whoever can command a majority in the House of Representatives is entitled to be asked by the Governor-General to form a government, and take the title Prime Minister.
* Governors-General always act on the advice of their Prime Minister or other relevant minister in regard to particular powers they may exercise.
* An incumbent Prime Minister who loses an election will advise the Governor-General to appoint the leader of the larger party as Prime Minister so the Governor-General does not need to act alone.
* State Premiers tender advice to State Governors for Federal Senate elections, in response to the Prime Minister&#x27;s advice to the Governor-General to call a Federal House of Representatives election.
* State Governors are given a dormant commission to administer the Commonwealth if the Governor-General is unable to.
* Vice-regal officers act in a politically neutral way.

No convention is absolute; all but one (the second) of the above conventions were disregarded in the leadup to or during the constitutional crisis of 1975.

Ignoring constitutional conventions does not always result in a crisis. After the 2010 Tasmanian state election, the Governor of Tasmania rejected the advice of his Premier to appoint the leader of the opposition as Premier because he felt the advice was tendered in bad faith. The Premier went on to form a new government.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
* The six members of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, that are chosen by the Parliaments of entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, should be chosen in a way as to establish the national balance, of &quot;constituent peoples&quot;, in the Court (two Bosniaks, two Croatians and two Serbs), although the Constitution does not have this requirement.
* The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina should be of different nationality in every new term (establishing the &quot;rotation&quot;), although this is not formally regulated.
* The government of an entity should inform the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina of its intention to establish special parallel relationships with neighboring states, including negotiations. Also, the High Representative should be notified of any such intent, especially if there is a document that should be signed between parties, although the Constitution does not have this requirement (also for first example).

===Canada===
* The Prime Minister will request the Governor General to call an election upon the defeat of the government in a confidence or money vote. This convention was broken in 1968 when the ruling minority government of Lester B. Pearson unexpectedly lost a money vote. All the parties in Parliament, who were not prepared for a snap election, agreed to pass a resolution retroactively declaring the lost money vote was not a matter of confidence. 
*Though it is mentioned in various constitutional documents, the precise nature of the office of the Prime Minister operates mostly according to understood, uncodified British conventions.
* The Supreme Court of Canada is, by statute (the &quot;Supreme Court Act&quot;), composed of three justices from Quebec and six from anywhere in Canada (including Quebec). This is because Quebec uses civil law rather than the common law system used elsewhere in Canada; it is necessary to have a panel of at least three judges to hear civil law cases. By convention, the remaining six positions are divided in the following manner: three from Ontario; two from the western provinces, typically one from British Columbia and one from the prairie provinces, which rotate amongst themselves (although Alberta is known to cause skips in the rotation); and one from the Atlantic provinces, almost always from Nova Scotia or New Brunswick. The appointment of the most senior puisne justice to chief justice is a convention that has recently fallen into disuse.

===Chile===
Under the 1925 Chilean Constitution, the president was elected by an absolute majority of the popular vote; if no candidate won an absolute majority, the National Congress would hold a contingent election between the top two candidates. A constitutional convention developed that Congress would always elect the candidate with the most popular votes at a contingent election. In a television interview ahead of the 1964 Chilean presidential election, presidential candidate (and eventual winner) Eduardo Frei Montalva upheld this convention. However, this convention was nearly broken in 1970, where the Socialist candidate Salvador Allende, a self-proclaimed Marxist, won the most votes; thus, the contingent election became a battleground between the two major powers of the Cold War, with the United States launching a campaign to prevent Allende&#x27;s election by Congress while the Soviet Union gave its support to Allende. Although Allende was eventually elected at the contingent election, he was later overthrown by the military in 1973; under the military regime of Augusto Pinochet, which succeeded Allende, a new constitution was adopted in 1980, which replaced the contingent election with a runoff by popular vote, rendering the convention obsolete.

===Commonwealth Realms===
* The Governor-General is appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister of the day, is a resident of the country he or she will represent, and can be dismissed immediately on the advice of the Prime Minister (exceptions are Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, where the Governor-General is elected by Parliament and then formally appointed by the Monarch, and the United Kingdom, which has no vice-regal office). However, in Canada, provincial lieutenant-governors are appointed on the advice of the federal prime minister, not the provincial premier.
* Neither the Monarch nor a Governor-General will participate in the political process unless there is an extreme circumstance that merits the use of reserve powers, or when the advice tendered is contrary to established convention.
* Neither the Monarch nor a Governor-General will make partisan speeches or state partisan opinions. This convention was broken in 1975 by Sir Colin Hannah, the Governor of Queensland, who called for the defeat of the Whitlam government. The Queen, on Whitlam&#x27;s advice, revoked Hannah&#x27;s dormant commission to act as Administrator of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office later refused the Premier of Queensland&#x27;s request that they advise the Queen to appoint Hannah to a second term as Governor (in 1975, Australian State Governors were still appointed on the advice of UK ministers).

===Denmark===
* The Danish Constitution makes reference to the King in great detail. Apart from the fact that this is understood to include a Queen regnant as well, references to the King acting in a political capacity are understood to mean the Prime Minister, as the Constitution stipulates that the King exercises his powers through the Cabinet.
* According to the Constitution, any public expenditure must be provided for in the annual money bill or provisional money bills. However, although not provided for in the Constitution, according to constitutional custom, the Parliamentary Budgetary Committee has the power to authorise provisional expenditure, regardless of the fact that such expenditure is not formally included in the budget (such grants are however then marked for adoption in the next forthcoming money bill).

===France===
* If the president of the National Assembly, the president of the Senate or 60 deputies or 60 senators claim that a just-passed statute is unconstitutional, the President of the Republic does not sign the law and instead waits for a petition to be sent to the Constitutional Council.

=== Germany===
* The German Basic Law does not provide for a formal mechanism of parliamentary self-dissolution. The chancellor can only be forced out of office through a constructive vote of no confidence, which simultaneously opposes the current chancellor and nominates a replacement. However, snap elections were held in 1972, 1983 and 2005 by the chancellor deliberately losing a vote of confidence and then asking the president to dissolve the Bundestag – a request which was granted in each case but was controversial in 2005.
* The President of Germany is not required to renounce his political affiliation, but since the founding of the Federal Republic in 1949 all presidents have let their party membership &quot;rest&quot; for the duration of their time in office. Joachim Gauck was not a member of any party even prior to taking office. This &quot;resting&quot; party membership was tacitly approved by the CDU/CSU and SPD for presidents who had been members or their parties even though their party rules and bylaws do not provide for such a mechanism.
* Similar to the provisions about monarchs in many parliamentary monarchies, the Basic Law formally grants the President powers to be exercised &quot;on the advice of&quot; Parliament or the government which are in practice never exercised by the President without clear direction from those bodies.
* The Basic Law only specifies &quot;how&quot; a chancellor is to be elected, not &quot;who&quot; is eligible. With one exception (Kurt Georg Kiesinger) all chancellors thus far have been members of the Bundestag, even though that is not a requirement for election or serving. Similarly the office of &quot;candidate for chancellor&quot; which is usually nominated by major parties (SPD and CDU/CSU but also FDP in 2002 and the Greens in 2021) has no legal relevance and is not legally a precondition for being elected chancellor.
* Virtually all customs and informal rules regarding coalition agreements are based on convention rather than formal rules. Some are even in apparent conflict with the text of the constitution. The (&quot;coalition committee&quot;) which was first acknowledged to exist during the First Erhard cabinet is a method of resolving potential conflicts within a governing coalition that has been criticized as &quot;circumventing&quot; parliament and the cabinet as means to discuss and resolve such issues.
* Elections to the Bundestag are usually held in autumn with over half (12 out of 20) of those to date held in September. Only the very first election in 1949 (held in August), the snap elections of 1972 (held in November) and 1983 (held in March) and the election following German reunification held in December 1990 plus the election of 1987 (held in January) were held neither in September nor October. 
* Laws passed by the Bundestag only enter into force once signed by the President. While this is usually only a formality, more than once the President refused to sign a law on constitutional grounds pending a review by the German Constitutional Court – this mechanism is based on precedent and custom more than the letter of the law, which allows the President to withhold their signature without any reason whatsoever
* The President of the Bundestag is a member of the biggest faction, even if that faction is otherwise in opposition. This is one of few constitutional conventions already in place during the Weimar Republic and still followed today.

===Lebanon===
* The Lebanese constitution states that the President of Lebanon is elected by a simple majority of the Parliament of Lebanon. However, due to the country&#x27;s delicate ethnic balance, the Parliament&#x27;s various factions usually try to agree on a consensus candidate.
* Under the unwritten National Pact, the president must always be a Maronite Christian; the prime minister a Sunni Muslim; the speaker of Parliament a Shia Muslim; and the deputy speaker Greek Orthodox.

===Malaysia===
* At the federal level, the King acts on the Prime Minister&#x27;s advice, except on certain cases. At the state level, the respective ruler or governor acts on his Chief Minister&#x27;s advice.
* At the federal level, the Prime Minister is the leader of the party with an absolute majority of seats in the Dewan Rakyat (House of Representatives) and therefore most likely to command the support of the Dewan Rakyat; and likewise a Chief Minister, the leader of the party with an absolute majority of seats in a State Legislature and therefore most likely to command the support of such State Legislature. 
* The Prime Minister should be a member of the Dewan Rakyat.
* The Speaker of the Dewan Rakyat chairs the Joint Session of Parliament, where the King addresses both Dewan Negara (Senate) and Dewan Rakyat.

===New Zealand===
There is a convention that the Prime Minister of New Zealand should not ask for an early election unless they are unable to maintain confidence and supply. By the 1950s, it had also become a convention that elections should be held on the last Saturday of November, or the closest date to this range as possible. There are several times when these conventions have been broken and an election has been held several months earlier:
*1951 general election: Sidney Holland called the election to get a mandate to face down a dock works dispute. The government was returned to power with an increased majority; by this time the dispute had been resolved.
*1984 general election: Robert Muldoon&#x27;s government held a narrow four-seat majority in Parliament. Muldoon hoped to strengthen his leadership, as two backbenchers (Marilyn Waring and Mike Minogue) were threatening to rebel against the government in an opposition-sponsored anti-nuclear bill. However, Waring and Minogue had not threatened to block confidence and supply. The election was a decisive defeat for the government.
*2002 general election: Helen Clark called the election after the collapse of the Alliance, her coalition partners. Some critics argued that the government could still maintain confidence and supply and therefore the early election was not necessary. The Labour Party remained in power with two different coalition partners.

===Norway===
Because of the 1814 written constitution&#x27;s pivotal role in providing independence and establishing democracy in the 19th century, the Norwegian parliament has been very reluctant to change it. Few of the developments in the political system that have been taking place since then have been codified as amendments. This reluctance has been labelled constitutional conservatism. The two most important examples of constitutional conventions in the Norwegian political system are parliamentarism and the declining power of the King.
* Parliamentarism has evolved since 1884 and entails that the cabinet must maintain the support of parliament (an absence of mistrust) but it need not have its express support.
* All new laws are passed and all new cabinets are therefore formed in a de jure fashion by the King, although not necessarily in a de facto sense.
* According to the written constitution, the cabinet (council of ministers) are appointed by the King. The appointment of new cabinets by the King is a formality, and the king has not directly exercised executive powers since 1905.

===Spain===
Much of Spain&#x27;s political framework is codified in the Spanish Constitution of 1978, which formalizes the relationship between an independent constitutional monarchy, the government, and the legislature. However, the constitution invests the monarch as the &quot;arbitrator and moderator of the institutions&quot; of government.

* The King nominates a candidate to stand for the Presidency of the Government of Spain, sometimes known in English as &#x27;prime minister&#x27;. The nominee then stands before the Congress of Deputies and presents his political agenda for the upcoming legislative term, followed by a vote of confidence in the nominee and his agenda. The 1978 constitution allows the King to nominate anyone he sees fit to stand for the vote of confidence so long as the King has met with the political party leaders represented in the Congress beforehand. However, King Juan Carlos I consistently nominated the political party leader who commands a plurality of seats in the Congress of Deputies.
* The Spanish public perception that the monarchy be politically non-partisan in its adherence to constitutional protocol and convention, yet while protecting the public expression of personal political views by members of the royal family. Expressions of personal political views expressed in public include when the Prince of Asturias and his sisters protested against terrorism following the 2004 Madrid bombings, or when the Queen gave controversial political viewpoints during an informal interview.
* Constitutionally, the King appoints the twenty members to the General Council of the Judiciary. However, when a vacancy is observed the King&#x27;s appointment has been customarily on the advice of the government of the day. Additionally, the King appoints the President of the Supreme Court on the advice of the General Council of the Judiciary.
* According to the 1978 constitution, honours and titles of nobility, and civil and military decorations, are awarded by the King as head of state. However, in most cases since 1978, the King&#x27;s appointments of titles of nobility have been countersigned by the President of the Government of Spain, with civil awards having been nominated by the President and military awards having been nominated by the military.

=== Switzerland ===
The following constitutional conventions are part of the political culture of Switzerland. They hold true at the federal level and mostly so at the cantonal and communal level. Mostly, they aim to reconcile the democratic principle of majority rule with the need to achieve consensus in a nation that is much more heterogeneous in many respects than other nation-states.
* The government is a body of equals composed in political proportion to the weight of the various factions in Parliament; this creates a permanent grand coalition. For most of the post-war era, the composition of the Federal Council was fixed by the so-called magic formula.
* Members of a collective body, including the federal government, observe collegiality at all times, that is, they do not publicly criticise one another. They also publicly support all decisions of the collective, even against their own opinion or that of their political party. In the eye of many observers, this convention has become rather strained at the federal level, at least after the 2003 elections to the Swiss Federal Council.
* The presidency of a collective body, particularly a government, rotates yearly; the president is a .

===United Kingdom===

While the United Kingdom does not have a written constitution that is a single document, the collection of legal instruments that have developed into a body of law known as constitutional law has existed for hundreds of years.

As part of this uncodified British constitution, constitutional conventions play a key role. They are rules that are observed by the various constituted parts though they are not written in any document having legal authority; there are often underlying enforcing principles that are themselves not formal and codified. Nonetheless it is very unlikely that there would be a departure of such conventions without good reason, even if an underlying enforcing principle has been overtaken by history, as these conventions also acquire the force of custom. Examples include:

* The texts of most international treaties are laid before Parliament at least 21 days before ratification (the &#x27;Ponsonby Rule&#x27; of 1924). This convention was codified by the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010.
* The monarch will accept and act on the advice of their ministers, who are responsible to Parliament for that advice; the monarch does not ignore that advice, except when exercising reserve powers.
** The principle that this advice must itself serve a legitimate purpose has been held to be a matter of law: &quot;Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service&quot;.
** The principle that the advice must not frustrate Parliament&#x27;s role in holding the Prime Minister to account is also a matter of law: &quot;R (Miller) v The Prime Minister&quot; and &quot;Cherry v Advocate General for Scotland&quot;.
* The Prime Minister is leader of the party (or coalition of parties) with an absolute majority of seats in the House of Commons and therefore most likely to command the support of the House of Commons.
** Where no party or coalition has an absolute majority, the leader of the party with the most seats in the Commons is given the first opportunity to seek to form a government. This convention was asserted by Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrat party, to justify seeking a coalition with the Conservatives instead of Labour (who additionally would not have been able to form a majority without other parties) in the hung parliament following the 2010 general election.
* All money bills must originate in the House of Commons.
* The monarch grants royal assent to all legislation – sometimes characterised as all legislation passed in good faith. It is possible that ministers could advise against giving consent, as happens with the Crown dependencies (convention since the early 18th century – previously monarchs did refuse or withhold royal assent).
* The Prime Minister should be a member of either House of Parliament (between the 18th century and 1963).
** By 1963 this convention had evolved to the effect that no Prime Minister should come from the House of Lords, due to the Lords&#x27; lack of democratic legitimacy. When the last Prime Minister peer, the Earl of Home, took office he renounced his peerage, and as Sir Alec Douglas-Home became an MP.
** The Prime Minister can hold office temporarily whilst not a Member of Parliament, for example during a general election or, in the case of Douglas-Home, between resigning from the Lords and being elected to the Commons in a by-election.
* All Cabinet members must be members of the Privy Council, since the cabinet is a committee of the council. Further, certain senior Loyal Opposition shadow cabinet members are also made Privy Counsellors, so that sensitive information may be shared with them &quot;on Privy Council terms&quot;.
* The House of Lords should not reject a budget passed by the House of Commons. This was broken controversially in 1909 by the House of Lords, which argued that the Convention was linked to another Convention that the Commons would not introduce a Bill that &#x27;attacked&#x27; peers and their wealth. The Lords claimed that the Commons broke this Convention in Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George&#x27;s &quot;People&#x27;s Budget&quot;, justifying the Lords&#x27; rejection of the budget. The Commons disputed the existence of a linked convention. As a consequence, the Lords&#x27; powers over budgets were greatly lessened, including by removing their power to reject a bill, by the Parliament Act 1911.
* During a general election, no major party shall put up an opponent against a Speaker seeking re-election. This convention was not respected during the 1987 general election, when both the Labour Party and the Social Democratic Party fielded candidates against the formerly Conservative Speaker, Bernard Weatherill, who was MP for Croydon North East. The Scottish National Party (SNP) does stand against the Speaker who represents a Scottish constituency, as was the case with Michael Martin, Speaker from 2000 to 2009.
* The Westminster Parliament will only legislate with respect to Scotland or Wales on reserved matters. It will not legislate on non-reserved matters (&#x27;devolved matters&#x27;) without first seeking the consent of the Scottish Parliament (since 1999, the Sewel convention, later renamed to legislative consent motions) or Senedd Cymru (since the Wales Act 2017).
* The House of Lords shall not oppose legislation from the House of Commons that was a part of the government&#x27;s manifesto (the Salisbury convention).

=== United States ===
*The President of the United States will give his State of the Union address in person, before a joint session of Congress, and will do so every year except the first year of a new term (in which the President&#x27;s inaugural address stands loosely in its stead). This practice was followed by George Washington and John Adams but abandoned by Thomas Jefferson and not resumed until 1913, when Woodrow Wilson delivered his State of the Union address in person. The constitution requires the President give an update on the state of the union &quot;from time to time&quot;, but no specifics are outlined. Speeches have been broadcast on radio since 1923 and 1947; the last State of the Union message delivered only in writing was in 1981 by Jimmy Carter during his lame duck period.
*Much of how the United States Cabinet operates is dictated by convention; its operations are only vaguely alluded to in the US constitution.
*While members of the United States House of Representatives are only required to live in the state they represent, it has generally been expected that they live in the district they represent as well, though there are some exceptions; Allen West was elected in 2010 representing a district adjacent to the one he resided in.
*The President of the United States will obtain the consent of both Senators from a state before appointing a United States Attorney, federal district judge, or federal marshal with jurisdiction in that state.
*Cabinet officials and other major executive officers resign and are replaced when a new President takes office, unless explicitly asked to stay on by the new President.
*The Speaker of the House is always the Representative who leads the majority party, even though the Constitution does not specify that the Speaker must be a member of the chamber. Also by custom the Speaker does not vote (except to break a tie).
*The President pro tempore of the United States Senate is the seniormost Senator of the majority party.
*Members of the Electoral College are pledged to vote for a particular Presidential candidate, and are chosen by popular vote with the name of the candidate, and not necessarily the elector, on the ballot. 
*Senate rules require a majority of 60 votes to invoke cloture, that is, to break off debate on a bill and force a vote. The Senate could revise its rules at any time, and the rules for each session of the House and Senate are typically set at the beginning of each elected Congress. In the Senate, under the current rules, the filibuster is available as a tool for a large-enough minority to indefinitely block any measure it finds objectionable.

<text>Donato Bramante (1444 – 11 April 1514), born as Donato di Pascuccio d&#x27;Antonio and also known as Bramante Lazzari, was an Italian architect and painter. He introduced Renaissance architecture to Milan and the High Renaissance style to Rome, where his plan for St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica formed the basis of the design executed by Michelangelo. His Tempietto (San Pietro in Montorio) marked the beginning of the High Renaissance in Rome (1502) when Pope Julius II appointed him to build a sanctuary over the spot where Peter was martyred.

==Life==
===Urbino===
Bramante was born under the name Donato d&#x27;Augnolo, Donato di Pascuccio d&#x27;Antonio, or Donato Pascuccio d&#x27;Antonio in Fermignano near Urbino. Here, in 1467, Luciano Laurana was adding to the Palazzo Ducale an arcaded courtyard and other Renaissance features to Federico da Montefeltro&#x27;s ducal palace. Bramante&#x27;s architecture has eclipsed his painting skills: he knew the painters Melozzo da Forlì and Piero della Francesca well, who were interested in the rules of perspective and illusionistic features in Andrea Mantegna&#x27;s painting.

===Milan===
Around 1474, Bramante moved to Milan, a city with a deep Gothic architectural tradition, and built several churches in the new Antique style. The Duke, Ludovico Sforza, made him virtually his court architect, beginning in 1476, with commissions that culminated in the famous trompe-l&#x27;œil choir of the church of Santa Maria presso San Satiro (1482–1486). Space was limited, and Bramante made a theatrical apse in bas-relief, combining the painterly arts of perspective with Roman details. There is an octagonal sacristy, surmounted by a dome. In Milan, Bramante also built the tribune of Santa Maria delle Grazie (1492–99); other early works include the Cloisters of Sant&#x27;Ambrogio, Milan (1497–1498), and some other constructions in Pavia (where he worked on the Cathedral, setting the design and creating the crypt and part of the apse) and possibly Legnano. However, in 1499, with his Sforza patron driven from Milan by an invading French army, Bramante made his way to Rome, where he was already known to the powerful Cardinal Riario.

===Rome===

In Rome, he was soon recognized by Cardinal Della Rovere, shortly to become Pope Julius II. For Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile or possibly Julius II, Bramante designed one of the most harmonious buildings of the Renaissance: the Tempietto (1502) of San Pietro in Montorio on the Janiculum. Despite its small scale, the construction has all the rigorous proportions and symmetry of Classical structures, surrounded by slender Doric columns, surmounted by a dome. According to a later engraving by Sebastiano Serlio, Bramante planned to set it within a colonnaded courtyard. In November 1503, Julius engaged Bramante for the construction of the grandest European architectural commission of the 16th century, the complete rebuilding of St Peter&#x27;s Basilica. During this time, he created the plans for a vast outdoor courtyard connecting the surrounding buildings called, Cortile del Belvedere. The cornerstone of the first of the great piers of the crossing was laid with ceremony on 17 April 1506. Very few drawings by Bramante survive, though some by his assistants do, demonstrating the extent of the team which had been assembled. Bramante&#x27;s vision for St Peter&#x27;s, a centralized Greek cross plan that symbolized sublime perfection for him and his generation (compare Santa Maria della Consolazione at Todi, influenced by Bramante&#x27;s work) was fundamentally altered by the extension of the nave after his death in 1514. Bramante&#x27;s plan envisaged four great chapels filling the corner spaces between the equal transepts, each one capped with a smaller dome surrounding the great dome over the crossing. So Bramante&#x27;s original plan was very much more Romano-Byzantine in its forms than the basilica that was actually built. (See St Peter&#x27;s Basilica for further details.)

Bramante also worked on several other commissions. Among his earliest works in Rome, before the Basilica&#x27;s construction was under way, is the cloister (1500–1504) of Santa Maria della Pace near Piazza Navona.

<text>Drowning is a type of suffocation induced by the submersion of the mouth and nose in a liquid. Submersion injury refers to both drowning and near-miss incident. Most instances of fatal drowning occur alone or in situations where others present are either unaware of the victim&#x27;s situation or unable to offer assistance. After successful resuscitation, drowning victims may experience breathing problems, confusion, or unconsciousness. Occasionally, victims may not begin experiencing these symptoms until several hours after they are rescued. An incident of drowning can also cause further complications for victims due to low body temperature, aspiration, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (respiratory failure from lung inflammation).

Drowning is more likely to happen when spending extended periods of time near large bodies of water. Risk factors for drowning include alcohol use, drug use, epilepsy, minimal swim training or a complete lack of training, and, in the case of children, a lack of supervision. Common drowning locations include natural and man-made bodies of water, bathtubs, and swimming pools.

Drowning occurs when a person spends too much time with their nose and mouth submerged in a liquid to the point of being unable to breathe. If this is not followed by an exit to the surface, low oxygen levels and excess carbon dioxide in the blood trigger a neurological state of breathing emergency, which results in increased physical distress and occasional contractions of the vocal folds. Significant amounts of water usually only enter the lungs later in the process.

While the word &quot;drowning&quot; is commonly associated with fatal results, drowning may be classified into three different types: drowning that results in death, drowning that results in long-lasting health problems, and drowning that results in no health complications. Sometimes the term &quot;near-drowning&quot; is used in the latter cases. Among children who survive, health problems occur in about 7.5% of cases.

Steps to prevent drowning include teaching children and adults to swim and to recognise unsafe water conditions, never swimming alone, use of personal flotation devices on boats and when swimming in unfavourable conditions, limiting or removing access to water (such as with fencing of swimming pools), and exercising appropriate supervision. Treatment of victims who are not breathing should begin with opening the airway and providing five breaths of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is recommended for a person whose heart has stopped beating and has been underwater for less than an hour.

== Causes ==
A major contributor to drowning is the inability to swim. Other contributing factors include the state of the water itself, distance from a solid footing, physical impairment, or prior loss of consciousness. Anxiety brought on by fear of drowning or water itself can lead to exhaustion, thus increasing the chances of drowning.

Approximately 90% of drownings take place in freshwater (rivers, lakes, and a relatively small number of swimming pools); the remaining 10% take place in seawater. Drownings in other fluids are rare and often related to industrial accidents. In New Zealand&#x27;s early colonial history, so many settlers died while trying to cross the rivers that drowning was called &quot;the New Zealand death&quot;.

People have drowned in as little as of water while lying face down.

Death can occur due to complications following an initial drowning. Inhaled fluid can act as an irritant inside the lungs. Even small quantities can cause the extrusion of liquid into the lungs (pulmonary edema) over the following hours; this reduces the ability to exchange the air and can lead to a person &quot;drowning in their own body fluid&quot;. Vomit and certain poisonous vapors or gases (as in chemical warfare) can have a similar effect. The reaction can take place up to 72 hours after the initial incident and may lead to a serious injury or death.

=== Risk factors===

Many behavioral and physical factors are related to drowning:

*Drowning is the most common cause of death for people with seizure disorders, largely in bathtubs. Epileptics are more likely to die due to accidents such as drowning. However, this risk is especially elevated in low and middle-income countries compared to high-income countries.
*The use of alcohol increases the risk of drowning across developed and developing nations. Alcohol is involved in approximately 50% of fatal drownings, and 35% of non-fatal drownings. 
* Inability to swim can lead to drowning. Participation in formal swimming lessons can reduce this risk. The optimal age to start the lessons is childhood, between one and four years of age.
*Feeling overly tired reduces swimming performance. This exhaustion can be aggravated by anxious movements motivated by fear during or in anticipation of drowning. An overconfident appraisal of one&#x27;s own physical capabilities can lead to &quot;swimming out too far&quot; and exhaustion before returning to solid footing.
* Free access to water can be hazardous, especially to young children. Barriers can prevent young children from gaining access to the water.
* Ineffective supervision, since drowning can occur anywhere there is water, even in the presence of lifeguards.
* Risk can vary with location depending on age. Children between one and four more commonly drown in home swimming pools than elsewhere. Drownings in natural water settings increase with age. More than half of drownings occurring among those fifteen years and older occurred in natural water environments.
* Familial or genetic history of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or sudden cardiac death (SCD) can predispose children to drown. Extensive genetic testing and/or consultation with a cardiologist should be done when there is a high suspicion of familial history and/or clinical evidence of sudden cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death.
* Individuals with undetected primary cardiac arrhythmias, as cold water immersion or aquatic exercise can induce these arrhythmias to occur.

Population groups at risk in the US are the old and young.
*Youth: drowning rates are highest for children under five years of age and people fifteen to twenty-four years of age.
*Minorities: the fatal unintentional drowning rate for African Americans above the age of 29 between 1999 and 2010 was statistically significantly higher than that of white people above the age of 29. The fatal drowning rate of African American children of ages from five to fourteen is almost three times that of white children in the same age range and 5.5 times higher in swimming pools. These disparities might be associated with a lack of basic swimming education in some minority populations.

=== Freediving ===
Some additional causes of drowning can also happen during freediving activities:

* Ascent blackout, also called deep water blackout, is caused by hypoxia during ascent from depth. The partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs under pressure at the bottom of a deep free dive is adequate to support consciousness but drops below the blackout threshold as the water pressure decreases on the ascent. It usually occurs when arriving near the surface as the pressure approaches normal atmospheric pressure.
* Shallow water blackout caused by hyperventilation prior to swimming or diving. The primary urge to breathe is triggered by rising carbon dioxide () levels in the bloodstream. The body detects levels accurately and relies on this to control breathing. Hyperventilation reduces the carbon dioxide content of the blood but leaves the diver susceptible to a sudden loss of consciousness without warning from hypoxia. There is no bodily sensation that warns a diver of an impending blackout, and people (often capable swimmers swimming under the surface in shallow water) become unconscious and drown quietly without alerting anyone to the fact that there is a problem and they are typically found at the bottom.

== Pathophysiology ==
Drowning is split into four stages:
# Breath-hold under voluntary control until the urge to breathe due to hypercapnia becomes overwhelming
# Fluid is swallowed and/or aspirated into the airways
# Cerebral anoxia stops breathing and aspiration 
# Cerebral injury due to anoxia becomes irreversible

People who do not know how to swim can struggle on the surface of the water for only 20 to 60 seconds before being submerged. In the early stages of drowning, a person holds their breath to prevent water from entering their lungs. When this is no longer possible, a small amount of water entering the trachea causes a muscular spasm that seals the airway and prevents further passage of water. If the process is not interrupted, loss of consciousness due to hypoxia is followed by cardiac arrest.

===Oxygen deprivation===
A conscious person will hold their breath and will try to access air, often resulting in panic, including rapid body movement. This uses up more oxygen in the bloodstream and reduces the time until unconsciousness. The person can voluntarily hold their breath for some time, but the breathing reflex will increase until the person try to breathe, even when submerged.

The breathing reflex in the human body is weakly related to the amount of oxygen in the blood but strongly related to the amount of carbon dioxide . During an apnea, the oxygen in the body is used by the cells and excreted as carbon dioxide. Thus, the level of oxygen in the blood decreases, and the level of carbon dioxide increases. Increasing carbon dioxide levels lead to a stronger and stronger breathing reflex, up to the &quot;breath-hold breakpoint&quot;, at which the person can no longer voluntarily hold their breath. This typically occurs at an arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 55 mm Hg but may differ significantly between people.

When submerged into cold water, breath-holding time is significantly shorter than that in air due to the cold shock response. The breath-hold breakpoint can be suppressed or delayed, either intentionally or unintentionally. Hyperventilation before any dive, deep or shallow, flushes out carbon dioxide in the blood resulting in a dive commencing with an abnormally low carbon dioxide level: a potentially dangerous condition known as hypocapnia. The level of carbon dioxide in the blood after hyperventilation may then be insufficient to trigger the breathing reflex later in the dive.

Following this, a blackout may occur before the diver feels an urgent need to breathe. This can occur at any depth and is common in distance breath-hold divers in swimming pools. Both deep and distance free divers often use hyperventilation to flush out carbon dioxide from the lungs to suppress the breathing reflex for longer. It is important not to mistake this for an attempt to increase the body&#x27;s oxygen store. The body at rest is fully oxygenated by normal breathing and cannot take on any more. Breath-holding in water should always be supervised by a second person, as by hyperventilating, one increases the risk of shallow water blackout because insufficient carbon dioxide levels in the blood fail to trigger the breathing reflex.

A continued lack of oxygen in the brain, hypoxia, will quickly render a person unconscious, usually around a blood partial pressure of oxygen of 25–30 mmHg. An unconscious person rescued with an airway still sealed from laryngospasm stands a good chance of a full recovery. Artificial respiration is also much more effective without water in the lungs. At this point, the person stands a good chance of recovery if attended to within minutes. More than 10% of drownings may involve laryngospasm, but the evidence suggests that it is not usually effective at preventing water from entering the trachea. The lack of water found in the lungs during autopsy does not necessarily mean there was no water at the time of drowning, as small amounts of freshwater are absorbed into the bloodstream. Hypercapnia and hypoxia both contribute to laryngeal relaxation, after which the airway is open through the trachea. There is also bronchospasm and mucous production in the bronchi associated with laryngospasm, and these may prevent water entry at terminal relaxation.

The hypoxemia and acidosis caused by asphyxia in drowning affect various organs. There can be central nervous system damage, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary injury, reperfusion injury, and multiple-organ secondary injury with prolonged tissue hypoxia.

A lack of oxygen or chemical changes in the lungs may cause the heart to stop beating. This cardiac arrest stops the flow of blood and thus stops the transport of oxygen to the brain. Cardiac arrest used to be the traditional point of death, but at this point, there is still a chance of recovery. The brain cannot survive long without oxygen, and the continued lack of oxygen in the blood, combined with the cardiac arrest, will lead to the deterioration of brain cells, causing first brain damage and eventually brain death after six minutes from which recovery is generally considered impossible. Hypothermia of the central nervous system may prolong this. In cold temperatures below 6 °C, the brain may be cooled sufficiently to allow for a survival time of more than an hour.

The extent of central nervous system injury to a large extent determines the survival and long term consequences of drowning, In the case of children, most survivors are found within 2 minutes of immersion, and most fatalities are found after 10 minutes or more.

=== Water aspiration ===
If water enters the airways of a conscious person, the person will try to cough up the water or swallow it, often inhaling more water involuntarily. When water enters the larynx or trachea, both conscious and unconscious people experience laryngospasm, in which the vocal cords constrict, sealing the airway. This prevents water from entering the lungs. Because of this laryngospasm, in the initial phase of drowning, water enters the stomach, and very little water enters the lungs. Though laryngospasm prevents water from entering the lungs, it also interferes with breathing. In most people, the laryngospasm relaxes sometime after unconsciousness due to hypoxia in the larynx, and water can then enter the lungs, causing a &quot;wet drowning&quot;. However, about 7–10% of people maintain this seal until cardiac arrest. This has been called &quot;dry drowning&quot;, as no water enters the lungs. In forensic pathology, water in the lungs indicates that the person was still alive at the point of submersion. An absence of water in the lungs may be either a dry drowning or indicates a death before submersion.

Aspirated water that reaches the alveoli destroys the pulmonary surfactant, which causes pulmonary edema and decreased lung compliance, compromising oxygenation in affected parts of the lungs. This is associated with metabolic acidosis, secondary fluid, and electrolyte shifts. During alveolar fluid exchange, diatoms present in the water may pass through the alveolar wall into the capillaries to be carried to internal organs. The presence of these diatoms may be diagnostic of drowning.

Of people who have survived drowning, almost one-third will experience complications such as acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ALI/ARDS can be triggered by pneumonia, sepsis, and water aspiration. These conditions are life-threatening disorders that can result in death if not treated promptly. During drowning, aspirated water enters the lung tissues, causes a reduction in pulmonary surfactant, obstructs ventilation, and triggers a release of inflammatory mediators which results in hypoxia. Specifically, upon reaching the alveoli, hypotonic liquid found in freshwater dilutes pulmonary surfactant, destroying the substance. Comparatively, aspiration of hypertonic seawater draws liquid from the plasma into the alveoli and similarly causes damage to surfactant by disrupting the alveolar-capillary membrane. Still, there is no clinical difference between salt and freshwater drowning. Once someone has reached definitive care, supportive care strategies such as mechanical ventilation can help to reduce the complications of ALI/ARDS.

Whether a person drowns in freshwater or salt water makes no difference in respiratory management or its outcome. People who drown in freshwater may experience worse hypoxemia early in their treatment; however, this initial difference is short-lived.

=== Cold-water immersion ===

Submerging the face in water cooler than about triggers the diving reflex, common to air-breathing vertebrates, especially marine mammals such as whales and seals. This reflex protects the body by putting it into &quot;energy-saving&quot; mode to maximise the time it can stay underwater. The strength of this reflex is greater in colder water and has three principal effects:
* Bradycardia, a slowing of the heart rate to less than 60 beats per minute.
* Peripheral vasoconstriction, the restriction of the blood flow to the extremities to increase the blood and oxygen supply to the vital organs, especially the brain.
* Blood shift, the shifting of blood to the thoracic cavity, the region of the chest between the diaphragm and the neck, to avoid the collapse of the lungs under higher pressure during deeper dives.

The reflex action is automatic and allows both a conscious and an unconscious person to survive longer without oxygen underwater than in a comparable situation on dry land. The exact mechanism for this effect has been debated and may be a result of brain cooling similar to the protective effects seen in people who are treated with deep hypothermia.

The actual cause of death in cold or very cold water is usually lethal bodily reactions to increased heat loss and to freezing water, rather than any loss of core body temperature. Of those who die after plunging into freezing seas, around 20% die within 2 minutes from cold shock (uncontrolled rapid breathing and gasping causing water inhalation, a massive increase in blood pressure and cardiac strain leading to cardiac arrest, and panic), another 50% die within 15 – 30 minutes from cold incapacitation (loss of use and control of limbs and hands for swimming or gripping, as the body &#x27;protectively&#x27; shuts down the peripheral muscles of the limbs to protect its core), and exhaustion and unconsciousness cause drowning, claiming the rest within a similar time. A notable example of this occurred during the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, in which most people who entered the water died within 15–30 minutes.

Submersion into cold water can induce cardiac arrhythmias (abnormal heart rates) in healthy people, sometimes causing strong swimmers to drown. The physiological effects caused by the diving reflex conflict with the body&#x27;s cold shock response, which includes a gasp and uncontrollable hyperventilation leading to aspiration of water. While breath-holding triggers a slower heart rate, cold shock activates tachycardia, an increase in heart rate. It is thought that this conflict of these nervous system responses may account for the arrhythmias of cold water submersion.

Heat transfers very well into water, and body heat is therefore lost quickly in water compared to air, even in &#x27;cool&#x27; swimming waters around 70 °F (~20 °C). A water temperature of can lead to death in as little as one hour, and water temperatures hovering at freezing can lead to death in as little as 15 minutes. This is because cold water can have other lethal effects on the body. Hence, hypothermia is not usually a reason for drowning or the clinical cause of death for those who drown in cold water.

Upon submersion into cold water, remaining calm and preventing loss of body heat is paramount. While awaiting rescue, swimming or treading water should be limited to conserve energy, and the person should attempt to remove as much of the body from the water as possible; attaching oneself to a buoyant object can improve the chance of survival should unconsciousness occur.

Hypothermia (and cardiac arrest) presents a risk for survivors of immersion. This risk increases if the survivor—feeling well again—tries to get up and move, not realizing their core body temperature is still very low and will take a long time to recover.

Most people who experience cold-water drowning do not develop hypothermia quickly enough to decrease cerebral metabolism before ischemia and irreversible hypoxia occur. The neuroprotective effects appear to require water temperatures below about .

==Diagnosis==
The World Health Organization in 2005 defined drowning as &quot;the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid.&quot; This definition does not imply death or even the necessity for medical treatment after removing the cause, nor that any fluid enters the lungs. The WHO classifies this as death, morbidity, and no morbidity. There was also consensus that the terms wet, dry, active, passive, silent, and secondary drowning should no longer be used.

Experts differentiate between distress and drowning. 
* Distress – people &quot;in trouble&quot;, but who can still float, signal for help, and take action.
* Drowning – people &quot;suffocating&quot; and in &quot;imminent danger of death within seconds&quot;.

===Forensics===
Forensic diagnosis of drowning is considered one of the most difficult in forensic medicine. External examination and autopsy findings are often non-specific, and the available laboratory tests are often inconclusive or controversial. The purpose of an investigation is to distinguish whether the death was due to immersion or whether the body was immersed postmortem. The mechanism in acute drowning is hypoxemia and irreversible cerebral anoxia due to submersion in liquid.

Drowning would be considered a possible cause of death if the body was recovered from a body of water, near a fluid that could plausibly have caused drowning, or found with the head immersed in a fluid. A medical diagnosis of death by drowning is generally made after other possible causes of death have been excluded by a complete autopsy and toxicology tests. Indications of drowning are unambiguous and may include bloody froth in the airway, water in the stomach, cerebral edema and petrous or mastoid hemorrhage. Some evidence of immersion may be unrelated to the cause of death, and lacerations and abrasions may have occurred before or after immersion or death.

Diatoms should normally never be present in human tissue unless water was aspirated. Their presence in tissues such as bone marrow suggests drowning; however, they are present in soil and the atmosphere, and samples may be contaminated. An absence of diatoms does not rule out drowning, as they are not always present in water. A match of diatom shells to those found in the water may provide supporting evidence of the place of death. Drowning in saltwater can leave different concentrations of sodium and chloride ions in the left and right chambers of the heart, but they will dissipate if the person survived for some time after the aspiration, or if CPR was attempted, and have been described in other causes of death.

Most autopsy findings relate to asphyxia and are not specific to drowning. The signs of drowning are degraded by decomposition. Large amounts of froth will be present around the mouth and nostrils and in the upper and lower airways in freshly drowned bodies. The volume of froth is much greater in drowning than from other origins. Lung density may be higher than normal, but normal weights are possible after cardiac arrest or vasovagal reflex. The lungs may be overinflated and waterlogged, filling the thoracic cavity. The surface may have a marbled appearance, with darker areas associated with collapsed alveoli interspersed with paler aerated areas. Fluid trapped in the lower airways may block the passive collapse that is normal after death. Hemorrhagic bullae of emphysema may be found. These are related to the rupture of alveolar walls. These signs, while suggestive of drowning, are not conclusive.

==Prevention==

It is estimated that more than 85% of drownings could be prevented by supervision, training in water skills, technology, and public education. Measures that help to prevent drowning include the following:
* Learning to swim: Being able to swim is one of the best defences against drowning. It is recommended that children learn to swim in a safe and supervised environment when they are between 1 and 4 years old, but learning to swim is recommended at any age.
* Surveillance: The surveillance of swimmers, especially children, is essential, because drownings may be silent and go unnoticed. A drowning person may be unable to wave, shout or even speak, and remain below the surface or unconscious. The highest rates of drowning globally are among children under five years-old. People who already know how to swim could need certain surveillance too. Many pools and bathing areas have lifeguards or a drowning detection system, and local legislation may require surveillance methods. Non-professional bystanders are important in detecting and notifying drownings. Lifeguards can be called by mobile phone in many cases. Evidence shows that alarms in pools are unreliable. The World Health Organization recommends that the most crowded hours be addressed by increasing the number of lifeguards at those times.
* Education and awareness: The WHO recommends wide training of the public in first aid, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and to behave safely in the water. Swimmers need to understand how to swim within their own abilities with regard to currents, depth, temperature or waves and to be informed of the state of the sea. Even good swimmers may drown because of water conditions and other circumstances, so need to learn how to select safe places that have surveillance and to understand the local conditions and to follow the rules. Many people who drown fail to follow the local safety guidelines or pay attention to signs indicating swimming restrictions and lifeguard duties. 
*Shallow water and obstructions: Local conditions may include shallow water and obstructions. It is not prudent to jump into the water without having calculated the deepness, especially if falling directly with the head. Between 1.2% and 22% of all spinal injuries are from accidents diving into shallow water or hitting hidden obstructions such as submerged trees. Up to 21% of shallow-water diving accidents cause spinal injury, risking permanent paralysis, or death.
* Alcohol and drugs: Alcohol and drugs increase the risk of drowning, and this risk increases for bars near water and parties on boats. For example, Finland sees several alcohol-implicated drownings every year at the Midsummer weekend as Finns celebrate in and around lakes and beaches.
*Anxiety and panic in water: The anxious movements produced by fear during drowning can render the swimmers exhausted. Additionally, an error calculating the own energies can also leave oneself too much tired before reaching firm ground. Reducing the rhythm of swimming allows rest and recovering. In case of suffering a cramp or contracture (muscle spasm), it is recommended to keep calm, move towards the shore (or pool&#x27;s border), and ask for help if necessary. The stings of forms of marine life can also produce panic, but, after receiving a sting of most types, it is possible to get out of the water without serious problems, even if some pain appears. And, for most of the swimming problems, it can be useful to take a horizontal position, face up, because it allows to float without any effort.
* Awareness of medical conditions: Some medical conditions such as epilepsy, syncope, cramp or seizures demand caution when in water, or near water. They may require controlled conditions for swimming (and even washing) and a good understanding of the individual&#x27;s limitations.
* State of the water: It is recommended to be aware of turbulences, dangerous waves, undertow, wind and weather conditions, dangerous animals, and water temperature. Currents of water (as river currents and sea rip currents) can carry the swimmers away with great force, so authorities in safety often recommend to the users of swimming areas avoiding useless efforts in the opposite direction, but, instead, taking some advantage of the current direction while swimming or floating outwards.
*Safety equipment: All boats and pools must be equipped with adequate safety equipment, such as lifejackets or lifebuoys; often this is a regulatory requirement. Any recreational activity on a boat or near water requires that a lifejacket be worn, especially by children who cannot swim and others at risk of drowning. Lifejackets must be well-fitting and properly fastened, and their wearers must understand that they have to jump into water with a one of them, and use it by fastening the strap properly and grabbing the front neck area with both hands. Emergency flotation equipment, such as a circular lifebuoy, can be thrown to the swimmer if available but, if not, any other flotation device, including inner tubes, water wings or foam tubes are used.
*Navigation safety: Navigation accidents are a cause of drowning that can be prevented staying informed about the state of the sea, having the proper safety instruments (especially lifejackets on board, as mentioned before) and with any other advisable measure that can be applied.
*Rescue robots and drones: Remote-controlled devices may assist a water rescue. Floating rescue robots can navigate to the victim to hold on to and even help to recover them. Aerial drones are fast, can help locate victims and even drop life jackets.
*Swimming in pairs (&quot;buddy system&quot;): Pairing up swimmers, so they keep surveillance each other, and are available to help in case of any problem (because of a purpose of safety, not for competitive reasons).
* Pool fencing: Every private and public swimming pool should be fully fenced, with child-proof latches on the gates. Many countries, including most Australian states since 1998 and France since 2003, require the fencing of pools. Objects (such as toys and others) can attract children to the water.
* Pool drains: Swimming pools may have filtration systems that circulate the water. Filtration drains without covers, or too strong, can injure swimmers by trapping hair or other parts of the body, leading to immobilization and drowning. Many small drainage holes are usually preferred to a single large one. Periodic inspections can check that the system is safe.
* Paying heed to warning signs, flags and advices: Because they indicate the safety of swimming and warn about any danger.

== Water safety ==
The concept of water safety involves the procedures and policies that are directed to prevent people from drowning or from becoming injured in water.

== Time limits ==

The time a person can safely stay underwater depends on many factors, including energy consumption, number of prior breaths, physical condition, and age. An average person can last between one and three minutes before falling unconscious and around ten minutes before dying. In an unusual case with the best conditions, a person was resuscitated after 65 minutes underwater.

==Management==
=== Rescue ===
When a person is drowning or a swimmer becomes missing, a fast water rescue may become necessary, to take that person out of the water as soon as possible. Drowning is not necessarily violent or loud, with splashing and cries; it can be silent.

==== Start and rescue methods from the ground ====
Rescuers should avoid endangering themselves unnecessarily; whenever it is possible, they should assist from a safe ground position, such as a boat, a pier, or any patch of land near the victim. The fastest way to assist is to throw a buoyant object (such as a lifebuoy or a broad branch). It is very important to avoid aiming directly at the victim, since even the lightest lifebuoys weight over 2 kilograms, and can stun, injure or even render a person unconscious if they impact on the head. Another way to assist is to reach the victim with an object to grasp, and then pull both of them out of the water. Some examples include: ropes, oars, broad branches, poles, one&#x27;s own arm, a hand, etc. This carries the risk of the rescuer being pulled into the water by the victim, so the rescuer must take a firm stand, lying down, as well as securing to some stable point. Any rescue with vehicles would have to avoid trampling or damaging the victim in another manner. Also, there are modern flying drones that can drop life jackets.

Bystanders should immediately call for help. A lifeguard should be called, if present. If not, an emergency telephone number should be contacted as soon as possible, to get the help of professionals and paramedics. In some cases of drowning, victims have been rescued by professionals from a boat or a helicopter. Less than 6% of people rescued by lifeguards need medical attention, and only 0.5% need CPR. The statistics worsen when rescues are made by bystanders.

If lifeguards or paramedics are unable to be called, bystanders must rescue the drowning person. It can be done using vehicles that the victim can reach, as row-boats or even modern robots, when they navigate across the water. 

==== Rescue by swimming ====
A human rescue by swimming carries a risk for the rescuer, who could be drowned trying it. Death of the would-be rescuer can happen because of the water conditions, the instinctive drowning response of the victim, the physical effort, and other problems.
First contact and gripping

In a swimming intervention, it is recommended to carry a floating object that makes the rescue easier. That is especially important at the moment when the rescuer reaches the victim&#x27;s area, because a drowning person in distress could cling to the rescuer in an attempt to stay above the water surface, which could sink both of them. In more affordable situations, the victim is exhausted, or has suffered a cramp, and stays calmer or fainted. But, in the worst cases, the victim will be anxious and with vigor. Then, the rescuer can approach the panicking person offering an object for flotation (as a rescue buoy), or any other, or even a hand, so the victim has something to grasp. In other situations, an expert rescuer could take one of the victim&#x27;s arms and press it against the victim&#x27;s back to restrict unnecessary movement. Communication is also important for coordination and allowing the rescue maneuvers.

If the victim clings to the rescuer, and there is not any flotation object, and the rescuer cannot control the situation (by simple communication, or by immobilizing, or by getting rid of the victim), a possibility is to dive underwater (as drowning people tend to move in the opposite direction, seeking the water surface) and consider a different approach to help the drowning victim.

Ascending an already sunk victim to the water surface

Sometimes, the victim is already sunk beneath the water surface. If this has happened, the rescue requires caution, as the victim could be conscious and cling to the rescuer underwater desperately. Victims with suspected serious spinal injuries (which limit the movements) would need special care and specific grips to be ascended properly.

In the best of cases, the sunk victim is unconscious floating shallowly under the water surface, and can be lifted to the surface by grabbing either (or both) of the victim&#x27;s arms and swimming, which pulls forward and upward, making the task easier (and enticing the victim to move). Anyway, after reaching the water surface, a victim will always have to be placed in a face-up horizontal position, or at least in any other with nose and mouth above the water, to be towed to firm ground.

When a victim is located deeper underwater, the rescuer should dive, take the victim from behind, and ascend vertically to the water surface holding the victim.

Moving a victim out of the water by towing

Finally, after a successful first physical contact with the victim (usually the most dangerous part, because victims can cling anxiously to the rescuers), the victim must be taken out of the water to a firm ground. This is achieved by a towing maneuver. It would be commonly a &#x27;supporting tow&#x27;: placing the victim body in a face-up horizontal position, and passing one hand under the victim&#x27;s armpit to then grab the jaw with it, and towing by swimming backwards. The victim&#x27;s mouth and nose must be kept above the water surface.

If the person is cooperative, the towing may be done in a similar fashion with the hands going under the victim&#x27;s armpits. Other styles of towing are possible, but all of them keeping the victim&#x27;s mouth and nose above the water.

Unconscious people may be pulled in an easier way: pulling on a wrist, or on the neck area of the shirt, while they are in a face-up horizontal position. Victims with suspected spinal injuries can require a more specific grip, and special care for their management, and a backboard (spinal board) may be needed for their rescue.

For unconscious people, an in-water resuscitation could increase the chances of survival by a factor of about three, but this procedure requires both medical and swimming skills, and it becomes impractical to send anyone besides the rescuer to execute that task. Chest compressions require a suitable platform, so an in-water assessment of circulation is pointless. If the person does not respond after a few breaths, cardiac arrest may be assumed, and getting them out of the water becomes a priority.

=== First aid ===
The checks for responsiveness and breathing are carried out with the person lying in a horizontally supine position (face up).

The traditional medical treatment for the drowned started expelling water from their lungs, tilting the victim face down (see drawing at right). However, handling the weight of the body could cost time and efforts in some cases, especially in victims with spinal injury (at the neck or the back) that affected their mobility, which requires special care.

If the victim is unconscious, but breathing, the recovery position is appropriate (laying on a side, usually the right, the left is recommended in women since 7 and a half months of pregnancy approximately).If the victim is not breathing, rescue ventilation is necessary. In cases when drowning produces a gasping pattern of apnea while the heart is still beating, ventilation alone could be sufficient. But in the cases when ventilation is not enough, a complete cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be used. Guides for victims of drowning indicate calling to an emergency telephone number if not yet done; a rescuer alone with the victim would do it after two minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

The cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) would follow an &#x27;airway-breathing-circulation&#x27; (&#x27;ABC&#x27;) sequence, starting with rescue breaths rather than with compressions as it is typical in cardiac arrest, because the problem is the lack of oxygen.

For a not-breathing adult or child (someone bigger than a baby), patient&#x27;s head would be tilted back, to improve the rescue breaths. It is recommended to start the cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with 2 initial rescue breaths, because of the lack of oxygen and the possibility of water in the airway; the rescue breaths are made by pinching the victim&#x27;s nose and blowing air mouth-to-mouth, not excessively. Next, it is applied a continual alternation of 30 chest compressions (pressing on the lower half of the sternum, the vertical bone of the middle of the chest) and 2 rescue breaths (in the same manner that the initial ones). This alternation is repeated until vital signs are re-established, the rescuers are unable to continue, or emergency medical services arrive. Additionally, an amount of victims of drowning may have suffered a type of cardiorespiratory arrest that requires a defibrillator (AED) to correct it (read further below). 
For not-breathing babies (very small sized infants), the procedure is the same than above but slightly modified: the baby&#x27;s head is not tilted back, but left straight, looking forward, which is necessary for the rescue breaths, because of the neck&#x27;s size in babies. In each series of 2 rescue breaths (and the 2 initial breaths), the rescuer&#x27;s mouth covers the baby&#x27;s mouth and nose simultaneously (because a baby&#x27;s face is too small). And, in the intercalated series of 30 chest compressions, they are also applied by pressing on the lower half of the sternum, the vertical bone of the middle of the chest, but with only two fingers (because the body of the baby being more fragile). Additionally, some infants may have suffered a type of cardiorespiratory arrest that requires a defibrillator (AED) to correct it (read below). 

Defibrillators (AED) can be found in many public places. They produce a defibrillation (electric shocks) that can restore the pulse of a victim. Anyway, they would only work in some specific cases. Defibrillators are easy to use, as they emit their instructions with voice messages. Before trying a defibrillation, the victim and the rescuer must be out of the water, and the victim&#x27;s body must be dried. If the body of the victim is extremely cold, it would have to be warmed to improve defibrillation.

Methods to expel water from the airway such as abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver) or positioning the head downwards, should be avoided, due to there being no obstruction by solids, and they delay the start of ventilation, and increase the risk of vomiting. The risk of death is increased, as the aspiration of stomach contents is a common complication of the resuscitation efforts.

Treatment for hypothermia may also be necessary. However, in those who are unconscious, it is recommended their temperature not be increased above 34 degrees C. Because of the diving reflex, people submerged in cold water and apparently drowned may revive after a long period of immersion. Rescuers retrieving a child from water significantly below body temperature should attempt resuscitation even after protracted immersion.

===Medical care===
People with a near-drowning experience who have normal oxygen levels and no respiratory symptoms should be observed in a hospital environment for a period of time to ensure there are no delayed complications. The target of ventilation is to achieve 92% to 96% arterial saturation and adequate chest rise. Positive end-expiratory pressure will improve oxygenation. Drug administration via peripheral veins is preferred over endotracheal administration. Hypotension remaining after oxygenation may be treated by rapid crystalloid infusion. Cardiac arrest in drowning usually presents as asystole or pulseless electrical activity. Ventricular fibrillation is more likely to be associated with complications of pre-existing coronary artery disease, severe hypothermia, or the use of epinephrine or norepinephrine.

While surfactant may be used, no high-quality evidence exist that looks at this practice. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be used in those who cannot be oxygenated otherwise. Steroids are not recommended.

==Prognosis==

People who have drowned who arrive at a hospital with spontaneous circulation and breathing usually recover with good outcomes. Early provision of basic and advanced life support improve the probability of a positive outcome.

A longer duration of submersion is associated with a lower probability of survival and a higher probability of permanent neurological damage.

Contaminants in the water can cause bronchospasm and impaired gas exchange and can cause secondary infection with delayed severe respiratory compromise.

Low water temperature can cause ventricular fibrillation, but hypothermia during immersion can also slow the metabolism, allowing longer hypoxia before severe damage occurs. Hypothermia that reduces brain temperature significantly can improve the outcome. A reduction of brain temperature by 10 °C decreases ATP consumption by approximately 50%, which can double the time the brain can survive.

The younger the person, the better the chances of survival. In one case, a child submerged in cold () water for 66 minutes was resuscitated without apparent neurological damage. However, over the long term significant deficits were noted, including a range of cognitive difficulties, particularly general memory impairment, although recent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) were within normal range.

===Children===
Drowning is a major worldwide cause of death and injury in children. An estimate of about 20% of non-fatal drowning victims may result in varying degrees of ischemic and/or hypoxic brain injury. Hypoxic injuries refers to a lack or absence of oxygen in certain organs or tissues. Ischemic injuries on the other hand refers inadequate blood supply to certain organs or part of the body. These injuries can lead to an increased risk of long-term morbidity. Prolonged hypothermia and hypoxemia from nonfatal submersion drowning can result in cardiac dysrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation, sinus bradycardia, or atrial fibrillation. Long-term neurological outcomes of drowning cannot be predicted accurately during the early stages of treatment. Although survival after long submersion times, mostly by young children, has been reported, many survivors will remain severely and permanently neurologically compromised after much shorter submersion times. Factors affecting the probability of long-term recovery with mild deficits or full function in young children include the duration of submersion, whether advanced life support was needed at the accident site, the duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and whether spontaneous breathing and circulation are present on arrival at the emergency room. Prolonged submersion in water for more than 5–10 minutes usually leads to poorer prognosis.

Data on the long-term outcome are scarce and unreliable. Neurological examination at the time of discharge from the hospital does not accurately predict long-term outcomes. Some people with severe brain injury who were transferred to other institutions died months or years after the drowning and are recorded as survivors. Nonfatal drownings have been estimated as two-to-four times more frequent than fatal drownings.

==== Long-term effects of drowning in children ====
Long-term effects of nonfatal drowning include damage to major organs such as the brain, lungs, and kidneys. Prolonged submersion time is attributed to hypoxic ischemic brain injury in susceptible areas of the brain such as the hippocampus, insular cortex, and/or basal ganglia. Severity in hypoxic ischemic damage of these brain structures corresponds to the severity in global damage to areas of the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex is a brain structure that is responsible for language, memory, learning, emotion, intelligence, and personality. Global damage to the cerebral cortex can affect one or more of its primary function. Treatment of pulmonary complication from drowning is dependent on the amount of lung injury that occurred during the incident. These lung injuries can be contributed by water aspiration and also irritants present in the water such as microbial pathogens leading to complications such as lung infection that can develop in adult respiratory disease syndrome later on in life. Some literature suggests that occurrences of drowning can lead to acute kidney injury from lack of blood flow and oxygenation due to shock and global hypoxia. These kidney injury can cause irreversible damage to the kidneys and may require long-term treatment such as renal replacement therapy.

==== Infant risk ====
Children are overrepresented in drowning statistics, with children aged 0–4 years old having the highest number of deaths due to unintentional drowning. In 2019 alone, 32,070 children between the ages of 1 and 4 years died as a result of unintentional drowning, equating to an age-adjusted fatality of 6.04 per 100,000 children. Infants are particularly vulnerable because while their mobility develops quickly, their perception concerning their ability for locomotion between surfaces develops slower. An infant can have full control of their movements, but will not recognize that water does not provide the same support for crawling as hardwood floors would. An infant&#x27;s capacity for movement needs to be met with an appropriate perception of surfaces of support (and avoidance of surfaces that do not support locomotion) to avoid drowning. By crawling and interacting with their environment, infants learn to distinguish surfaces offering support for locomotion from those that do not, and their perception of surface characteristics will improve, as well as their perception of falls risk, over several weeks.

==Epidemiology==
In 2019, roughly 236,000 people died from drowning, thereby causing it to be the third leading cause of unintentional death globally, trailing traffic injuries and falls.

In many countries, drowning is one of the main causes of preventable death for children under 12 years old. In the United States in 2006, 1100 people under 20 years of age died from drowning. The United Kingdom has 450 drownings per year, or 1 per 150,000, whereas in the United States, there are about 6,500 drownings yearly, around 1 per 50,000. In Asia suffocation and drowning were the leading causes of preventable death for children under five years of age; a 2008 report by UNICEF found that in Bangladesh, for instance, 46 children drown each day.

Due to a generally increased likelihood for risk-taking, males are four times more likely to have submersion injuries.

In the fishing industry, the largest group of drownings is associated with vessel disasters in bad weather, followed by man-overboard incidents and boarding accidents at night, either in foreign ports or under the influence of alcohol. Scuba diving deaths are estimated at 700 to 800 per year, associated with inadequate training and experience, exhaustion, panic, carelessness, and barotrauma.

===South Asia ===
Deaths due to drowning is high in the South Asian region with India, China, Pakistan and Bangladesh accounting for up to 52% of the global deaths. Death due to drowning is known to be high in the Sundarbans region in West Bengal and in Bihar.

According to the &quot;Daily Times&quot; in rural Pakistan, boats are the preferred mode of transport where available. Due to the influence of female modesty culture in Pakistan, women are not encouraged to swim.

In the Iranian Sistan province there have been numerous instances of children dying in hootak water holes.

=== Africa ===
In lower-income countries, cases of drowning and deaths caused by drowning are under reported and data collection is limited. Many low-income countries in Africa have the highest rates of drowning, with incidence rates calculated from population-based studies across 15 different countries (Burkina Faso, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Egypt, Ethiopia, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Seychelles, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe) ranging from 0.33 per 100,000 population to 502 per 100,000 population. Potential risk factors include young age, being male, having to commute across or work on the water (e.g. fishermen), quality and carrying capacity of the boat, and poor weather.

===United States=== 
In the United States, drowning is the second leading cause of death (after motor vehicle accidents) in children aged 12 and younger.

People who drown are more likely to be male, young, or adolescent. There is a racial disparity found in drowning incidents. According to CDC data collected from 1999 to 2019, drowning rates among Native Americans was 2 times higher than non-Hispanic whites while the rate among African-Americans was 1.5 times higher. Surveys indicate that 10% of children under 5 have experienced a situation with a high risk of drowning. Worldwide, about 175,000 children die through drowning every year. The causes of drowning cases in the US from 1999 to 2006 were as follows:
According to the US National Safety Council, 353 people ages 5 to 24 drowned in 2017.

==Society and culture==
===Old terminology===
The word &quot;drowning&quot;—like &quot;electrocution&quot;—was previously used to describe fatal events only. Occasionally, that usage is still insisted upon, though the medical community&#x27;s consensus supports the definition used in this article. Several terms related to drowning which have been used in the past are also no longer recommended. These include:

*Active drowning: people, such as non-swimmers and the exhausted or hypothermic at the surface, who are unable to hold their mouth above water and are suffocating due to lack of air. Instinctively, people in such cases perform well-known behaviors in the last 20–60 seconds before being submerged, representing the body&#x27;s last efforts to obtain air. Notably, such people are unable to call for help, talk, reach for rescue equipment, or alert swimmers even feet away, and they may drown quickly and silently close to other swimmers or safety.
*Dry drowning: drowning in which no water enters the lungs.
*Near drowning: drowning which is not fatal.
*Wet drowning: drowning in which water enters the lungs.
*Passive drowning: people who suddenly sink or have sunk due to a change in their circumstances. Examples include people who drown in an accident due to sudden loss of consciousness or sudden medical condition.
*Secondary drowning: physiological response to foreign matter in the lungs due to drowning causing extrusion of liquid into the lungs (pulmonary edema) which adversely affects breathing.
*Silent drowning: drowning without a noticeable external display of distress.

=== Dry drowning ===
&quot;Dry drowning&quot; is an urban legend according to which some people, notably children, die of drowning hours or days after swimming or ingesting water. Misinformation about this supposed phenomenon is spread cyclically, mostly at the beginning of summer, over social media.

As a medical condition, &quot;dry drowning&quot; has never had an accepted definition, and the term is discredited. Following the 2002 World Congress on Drowning in Amsterdam, a consensus definition of drowning was established: it is the &quot;process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid.&quot; This definition resulted in only three legitimate drowning subsets: fatal drowning, non-fatal drowning with illness/injury, and non-fatal drowning without illness/injury. In response, major medical consensus organizations have adopted this definition worldwide and have discouraged any medical or publication use of the term &quot;dry drowning&quot;. Such organizations include the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, the Wilderness Medical Society, the American Heart Association, the Utstein Style system, the International Lifesaving Federation, the International Conference on Drowning, Starfish Aquatics Institute, the American Red Cross, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization and the American College of Emergency Physicians.

Drowning experts have recognized that the resulting pathophysiology of hypoxemia, acidemia, and eventual death is the same whether water entered the lung or not. As this distinction does not change management or prognosis but causes significant confusion due to alternate definitions and misunderstandings, it is established that pathophysiological discussions of &quot;dry&quot; versus &quot;wet&quot; drowning are not relevant to drowning care.

&quot;Dry drowning&quot; is cited in the news with a wide variety of definitions. and is often confused with &quot;secondary drowning&quot; or &quot;delayed drowning&quot;. Various conditions including spontaneous pneumothorax, chemical pneumonitis, bacterial or viral pneumonia, head injury, asthma, heart attack, and chest trauma have been misattributed to the erroneous terms &quot;delayed drowning&quot;, &quot;secondary drowning&quot;, and &quot;dry drowning&quot;. Currently, there has never been a case identified in the medical literature where a person was observed to be without symptoms and who died hours or days later as a direct result of drowning alone. However, famed forensic pathologist Dr. Cyril H. Wecht has published at least one opinion asserting that the cause of death of a 16 year old student was due to &quot;delayed drowning&quot;

===Capital punishment===

In Europe, drowning was used as capital punishment. During the Middle Ages, a sentence of death was read using the words , or &quot;with pit and gallows&quot;.

Drowning survived as a method of execution in Europe until the 17th and 18th centuries. England had abolished the practice by 1623, Scotland by 1685, Switzerland in 1652, Austria in 1776, Iceland in 1777, and Russia by the beginning of the 1800s. France revived the practice during the French Revolution (1789–1799) and it was carried out by Jean-Baptiste Carrier at Nantes.

==Experience==
People who have experienced drowning have reported slowing of time, but this is suggested to be a function of recollection, not perception. If the person is conscious after the initial struggle and breath-holding, they may feel a burning or tearing sensation on aspirating water. This burning sensation does not depend on the type of water. Following this painful feeling, many report peaceful perceptions, hallucinations, diminished pain and even euphoria. Sensations of tranquility are not limited to drowning, and similar perceptions have also been reported in near-death experiences from other causes. The euphoria and calmness can be attributed to cerebral hypoxia and consequent changes in neurotransmitters. These experiences vary by person, because the rate of oxygen loss in the blood (and resulting hypoxia) depends on the circumstances.

<text>In geometry, a golden spiral is a logarithmic spiral whose growth factor is , the golden ratio. That is, a golden spiral gets wider (or further from its origin) by a factor of for every quarter turn it makes.

== Approximations of the golden spiral ==
There are several comparable spirals that approximate, but do not exactly equal, a golden spiral.

For example, a golden spiral can be approximated by first starting with a rectangle for which the ratio between its length and width is the golden ratio. This rectangle can then be partitioned into a square and a similar rectangle and this rectangle can then be split in the same way. After continuing this process for an arbitrary number of steps, the result will be an almost complete partitioning of the rectangle into squares. The corners of these squares can be connected by quarter-circles. The result, though not a true logarithmic spiral, closely approximates a golden spiral.

Another approximation is a Fibonacci spiral, which is constructed slightly differently. A Fibonacci spiral starts with a rectangle partitioned into 2 squares. In each step, a square the length of the rectangle&#x27;s longest side is added to the rectangle. Since the ratio between consecutive Fibonacci numbers approaches the golden ratio as the Fibonacci numbers approach infinity, so too does this spiral get more similar to the previous approximation the more squares are added, as illustrated by the image.

==Spirals in nature==
It is sometimes erroneously stated that spiral galaxies and nautilus shells get wider in the pattern of a golden spiral, and hence are related to both and the Fibonacci series.
In truth, many mollusk shells including nautilus shells exhibit logarithmic spiral growth, but at a variety of angles usually distinctly different from that of the golden spiral. Although spiral galaxies have often been modeled as logarithmic spirals, Archimedean spirals, or hyperbolic spirals, their pitch angles vary with distance from the galactic center, unlike logarithmic spirals (for which this angle does not vary), and also at variance with the other mathematical spirals used to model them.
Phyllotaxis, the pattern of plant growth, is in some case connected with the golden ratio because it involves successive leaves or petals being separated by the golden angle. Although this can sometimes be associated with spiral forms, such as in sunflower seed heads, these are more closely related to Fermat spirals than logarithmic spirals.

==Mathematics==

A golden spiral with initial radius 1 is the locus of points of polar coordinates formula_1 satisfying
formula_2
where formula_3 is the golden ratio.

The polar equation for a golden spiral is the same as for other logarithmic spirals, but with a special value of the growth factor :
formula_4
or
formula_5
with being the base of natural logarithms, being the initial radius of the spiral, and such that when is a right angle (a quarter turn in either direction):
formula_6

Therefore, is given by
formula_7
The numerical value of depends on whether the right angle is measured as 90 degrees or as formula_8 radians; and since the angle can be in either direction, it is easiest to write the formula for the absolute value of (that is, can also be the negative of this value):
formula_9
for in degrees, or
formula_10
for in radians.

An alternate formula for a logarithmic and golden spiral is
formula_11
where the constant is given by
formula_12
which for the golden spiral gives values of
formula_13
if is measured in degrees, and
formula_14
if is measured in radians.

With respect to logarithmic spirals the golden spiral has the distinguishing property
that for four collinear spiral points &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot; belonging to arguments 
the point &quot;C&quot; is the projective harmonic conjugate of &quot;B&quot; with respect to &quot;A&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, i.e. the cross ratio (&quot;A&quot;,&quot;D&quot;;&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot;) has the singular value −1. 
The golden spiral is the only logarithmic spiral with (&quot;A&quot;,&quot;D&quot;;&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot;) = (&quot;A&quot;,&quot;D&quot;;&quot;C&quot;,&quot;B&quot;).

===Polar slope===
In the polar equation for a logarithmic spiral:
formula_15
the parameter is related to the polar slope angle formula_16:
formula_17

In a golden spiral, formula_18 being constant and equal to formula_19 (for in radians, as defined above), the slope angle formula_16 is
formula_21
hence
formula_22
if measured in degrees, or
formula_23
if measured in radians.

Its complementary angle
formula_24
in radians, or
formula_25
in degrees, is the angle the golden spiral arms make with a line from the center of the spiral.

<text>Adelbert Ames (October 31, 1835 – April 13, 1933) was an American sailor, soldier, businessman and politician who served with distinction as a Union Army general during the American Civil War. A Radical Republican, he was military governor, U.S. Senator, and civilian governor in Reconstruction-era Mississippi. In 1898, he served as a United States Army general during the Spanish–American War. He was the last Republican to serve as the state governor of Mississippi until the election of Kirk Fordice, who took office in January 1992, 116 years after Ames vacated the office.

A staunch supporter of political equality for African Americans, Ames&#x27; tenure as governor of Mississippi was a longstanding point of controversy in the historiography around Reconstruction, with Dunning School and other &quot;Lost Cause&quot; historians casting him as a villain in American history. Conversely, his cause was championed by Black historians and, from the 1950s onward, other neo-abolitionist writers.

Ames was the penultimate surviving general officer of the Civil War, dying at the age of 97 in 1933. He was outlived only by Aaron Daggett, who died in 1938 at the age of 100. However, because Daggett was a brevet rank brigadier general of volunteers, Ames was the last surviving Civil War general who had held his rank in the regular U.S. or Confederate States army and was also the last surviving general of the conflict who had begun his career in the regular U.S. Army.

==Early life and career==
Adelbert ( ) Ames was born in 1835 in the town of Rockland (then known as East Thomaston), located in Knox County, Maine. He was the younger of two sons of Martha Bradbury Ames and Jesse Ames, a sea captain who later purchased what became the Ames Mill (renowned as the producers of Malt-O-Meal) in Northfield, Minnesota. Adelbert Ames also grew up to be a sailor and became a mate on a clipper ship, and he also served briefly as a merchant seaman on his father&#x27;s ship.

On July 1, 1856, he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York; he graduated five years later in May 1861, fifth in his class of forty-five. Two classes had graduated that year due to the beginning of the Civil War in April. Ames&#x27; class had graduated about a month earlier than usual, while a second class, set to graduate in 1862, graduated on June 24, 1861.

==American Civil War==
Ames was then commissioned a second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Artillery. Eight days later, he was promoted to first lieutenant and was assigned to the 5th U.S. Artillery. During the Battle of First Bull Run that July, Ames was seriously wounded in the right thigh but refused to leave his guns. He was brevetted to the rank of major on July 21 for his actions at Manassas. In 1893, Ames received the Medal of Honor for his performance there.

Returning to duty the following spring, Ames was part of the defenses of Washington, D.C. He then fought in the Peninsula Campaign and saw action at the Battle of Yorktown from April 5 to May 4, the Battle of Gaines&#x27; Mill on June 27, and the Battle of Malvern Hill that July. Ames was commended for his conduct at Malvern Hill by Col. Henry J. Hunt, chief of the artillery of the Army of the Potomac, and he received a brevet promotion to lieutenant colonel on July 1.

Although Ames was becoming an excellent artillery officer, he realized that significant promotions would be available only in the infantry. He returned to Maine and politicked to receive a commission as a regimental infantry commander and was assigned to command the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment on August 20, 1862. The 20th Maine fought in the Maryland Campaign but saw little action at the Battle of Antietam on September 17 while in a reserve capacity. During the Union defeat at the Battle of Fredericksburg that winter, Ames led his regiment in one of the last charges on December 13 against Marye&#x27;s Heights. During the Chancellorsville Campaign in May 1863, Ames volunteered as an aide-de-camp to Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, commander of the V Corps.

Probably as a result of this staff duty and his proximity to the influential Meade, Ames was promoted to brigadier general in the Union Army on May 20, 1863, two weeks following the Battle of Chancellorsville. Ames assumed brigade command in the XI Corps of the Army of the Potomac, relinquishing his command of the 20th Maine to Lt. Col. Joshua L. Chamberlain, who would soon lead the regiment to fame in the Battle of Gettysburg that July.
While his experience at Gettysburg did not achieve the renown of Chamberlain&#x27;s, Ames performed well under challenging circumstances. During the massive assault by Confederate Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell on July 1, 1863, Ames&#x27;s division commander, Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow, moved his division well in front of other elements of the XI Corps to a slight rise, now known as Barlow&#x27;s Knoll. This salient position was quickly overrun, and Barlow was wounded and captured. Ames took command of the division and led it in retreat through the streets of Gettysburg to a position on Cemetery Hill. On July 2, the second day of battle, Ames&#x27;s battered division bore the brunt of the assault on East Cemetery Hill by Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early, but was able to hold the critical position with help from surrounding units. At one point, Ames himself took part in the hand-to-hand fighting. After the battle, the men of the 20th Maine presented Ames with their battle flag as a token of their esteem.
After the battle, Ames reverted to brigade command with a brevet promotion to colonel in the regular army. His division, under the command of Brig. Gen. George H. Gordon, was transferred to the Department of the South, where it served in actions in South Carolina and Florida.

In 1864, Ames&#x27;s division, now part of the X Corps of the Army of the James, served under Maj. Gen. Benjamin Franklin Butler in the Bermuda Hundred Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg. In the future, he would become Butler&#x27;s son-in-law. That winter, the division was reassigned to the XXIV Corps and sent to North Carolina.

During the two years following his service in the Army of the Potomac, Ames shifted between brigade and division command (and even led his corps on two occasions). However, he generally can be identified as a division commander. He led the successful assault in the Second Battle of Fort Fisher (commanding the 2nd Division, XXIV Corps), accompanying his men into the formidable coastal fortress as most of his staff were shot down by Confederate snipers. He received a brevet promotion to major general in the Union Army (and brigadier general in the Regular Army) on March 13, 1865, for his role in the battle.

==Mississippi politics==
In 1868, Congress appointed Ames as provisional governor of Mississippi. His command soon extended to the Fourth Military District, which consisted of Mississippi and Arkansas. During his administration, he took several steps to advance the rights of formerly enslaved people, appointing the first black officeholders in state history. White supremacist terrorism and violence were prevalent in the state, one of the last to comply with Reconstruction, but a general election was held during his tenure in 1869. The legislature convened at the beginning of the following year.

Around 1868, Ames became an original companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, a military society of former Union officers and their descendants.

==U.S. senator==
The Mississippi Legislature elected Ames to the US Senate after the readmission of Mississippi to the Union. He served from February 24, 1870, to January 10, 1874, as a Republican. In Washington, Ames met and married on July 21, 1870, Blanche Butler, daughter of his former commander, then US Representative Benjamin Butler, later a one-term governor of Massachusetts. The couple had six children, including Blanche Ames Ames (the suffragist and cartoonist), Adelbert Ames Jr., and Butler Ames. As a senator, Ames became a talented public speaker to the point where even some of his Democratic opponents acknowledged his ability.

In the US Senate, Ames was chairman of the Senate Committee on Enrolled Bills. Upon being elected governor of Mississippi, he resigned his seat to assume his duties.

==Governor==
Ames battled James Lusk Alcorn, a former Confederate general, for control of the Republican Party, which then had mostly black voters. White Southerners who sided with the Republican Party were derisively referred to as &quot;scalawags&quot;. Southern Democrats painted so-called scalawags and &quot;carpetbaggers&quot; as traitors exploiting the Southern United States and trying to set up &quot;Negro rule&quot;. In truth, Republican promises to rebuild the Southern United States, restore prosperity, create public schools, and expand railroads attracted some white Southerners. The Ames-Alcorn struggle reflected deep fissures in the party. In 1873, both sought a decision by running for governor. The Radicals and most black voters supported Ames, and Alcorn won the votes of scalawags, moderate Whiggish whites. Ames won by a vote of 69,870 to 50,490.

As governor, Ames fought to cut spending and lower the tax rate with moderate success. The state rate of 14 1/2 mills in 1874 was reduced to 9 1/2 in 1875 and 6 1/2 in 1876.

Even his enemies agreed that the governor had rigorous integrity and was incorruptible and sincere. His appointments included some so-called scalawags and a few former Confederates, but he was never happy in Mississippi, and much of the time, his wife and family remained in the North, where the weather was cooler and the socioeconomic conditions were less unpleasant. Ames was proud of his record and considered himself one of the best Republican governors of any of the Reconstructed states. This opinion has been generally shared by historians ever since. However, he had little success in winning over his enemies in the party and was quick to attribute sinister motives on their part.

His real problems came from the Democratic efforts to undo Reconstruction and gain control. Democrats in Vicksburg launched a coup in December 1874. When the sheriff called on his supporters to restore him to office, a battle ended in the Vicksburg Massacre. Ames had no forces to send and depended on the federal government for troops to reinstate the ousted officials. In the following months, he failed to mobilize a state militia to cope with renewed troubles. By August, the Democratic Party had united to carry the legislative elections that fall and carried out what came to be called the &quot;Mississippi Plan&quot;. A riot in Yazoo county drove out the Republican sheriff and resulted in some blacks and party officers being lynched. The Clinton Riot on September 4 ended with white Democratic paramilitaries riding over the county, shooting every black person they chanced upon. With no other means of protection, Ames appealed to the federal government for assistance. It was not refused, but authorities urged him to exhaust state resources first.

Ames, unable to organize a state militia in time, signed a peace treaty with Democratic leaders. In return for disarming the few militia units he had assembled, they promised to guarantee a full, free, fair election, a promise they did not keep.

That November, Democrats terrorized a large part of the Republican vote into staying home, driving voters from the polls with shotguns and cannons, and gaining firm control of both houses of the legislature. The state legislature, convening in 1876, drew up articles of impeachment against Ames; with a five-to-one majority and deeply hostile feelings towards him, their investigations &quot;failed to trace a dollar of unearned money to his pockets,&quot; one reporter noted. &quot;Whatever Ames may be, he is not dishonest.&quot; Though insiders agreed that their case was a very weak one, removal was certain, particularly after his black lieutenant governor had been removed and the line of succession led to a Democrat. Rather than face an impeachment trial that would entail great expense, Ames&#x27;s lawyers made a deal: once the legislature had dropped all charges, he would resign his office, which occurred on March 29, 1876.

==Later life==
After leaving office, Ames settled briefly in Northfield, Minnesota, where he joined his father and brother in their flour-milling business. During his residence there, in September 1876, Jesse James and his gang of former Confederate guerrillas raided the town&#x27;s bank, primarily because of Ames&#x27;s (and controversial Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler&#x27;s) investment in it, but their attempt to rob it ended in catastrophic failure. Ames next headed to New York City, then later settled in Tewksbury, Massachusetts as an executive in a flour mill, along with other business interests in the nearby city of Lowell.

In 1898, he was appointed brigadier general of volunteers in the Spanish–American War and fought in Cuba. During the Battle of San Juan Hill the 3rd Brigade of the 1st Division suffered particularly high casualties with its brigade commander killed and the next two ranking regimental commanders wounded. General Ames was assigned to command the brigade during the Siege of Santiago. He commanded the 1st Division when the V Corps was mustered out in New York.

Several years afterward, he retired from business pursuits in Lowell but continued in real estate and entertainment projects in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Florida. Ames corresponded extensively with the historian James Wilford Garner during this period; Garner&#x27;s dissertation viewed Reconstruction as &quot;unwise&quot; but absolved Ames of personal corruption. Ames&#x27;s widow compiled a collection of her correspondence with Ames, &quot;Chronicles from the Nineteenth Century&quot;, published posthumously in 1957.

About 1900, Ames joined the Massachusetts Society of Colonial Wars.

Ames died in 1933 at 97, at his winter home in Ormond Beach, Florida. At the time of his death, Ames was the last surviving full-rank general who had served in the Civil War. (The last Union general officer, Aaron S. Daggett, lived five years longer than Ames, but he had been a brevet brigadier general of U.S. Volunteers in March 1865, while Ames had been promoted to the permanent rank of brigadier general in the Regular Army about the same period.)

Ames is buried in the Hildreth family cemetery — the family of his mother-in-law, Sarah Hildreth Butler — behind the main cemetery (also known as Hildreth Cemetery) on Hildreth Street in Lowell, Massachusetts. Buried with him are his wife, Blanche Butler Ames, their six children, and the spouses of his son Butler and his daughter Edith.

==Notable descendants==
Ames was the son-in-law of Civil War General Benjamin Butler.

His daughter Blanche Ames Ames (she married into another Ames family) was a noted suffragist, inventor, artist, and writer. The mansion she designed and built is now part of Borderland State Park in Massachusetts.

His son Adelbert Ames Jr. was a noted scientist and inventor of the Ames Room and the Ames Window.

His son Butler Ames was a businessman and politician, representing Massachusetts in Congress for ten years.

Adelbert Ames was also the great-grandfather of George Plimpton. John F. Kennedy, through George Plimpton, is indirectly responsible for a full-length biography of General Ames. In &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;, Kennedy relied on Reconstruction-era historical texts to produce a brief but misleading, false, and devastating portrait of Ames&#x27;s administration of Mississippi in his profile of Mississippi Senator Lucius Q. C. Lamar. Ames&#x27;s daughter Blanche Ames Ames, a formidable figure in Massachusetts, bombarded the then-senator with letters complaining about the depiction and continued her barrage after Kennedy entered the White House. President Kennedy then turned to his friend Plimpton to tell Blanche, Plimpton&#x27;s grandmother, that she was &quot;interfering with state business.&quot; Her response was to write a book about her father, &quot;Adelbert Ames&quot;, in 1964.

==In memoriam==

A Medal of Honor plaque for Ames&#x27;s gravesite was dedicated at a ceremony honoring Benjamin Butler&#x27;s 191st birthday, held at the Hildreth family cemetery—the only time of the year it is open to the public—on November 1, 2009.

The United Spanish War Veterans established Camp 19, General Adelbert Ames Post, in Lowell, Massachusetts.

===Ames Hill Castle===
After settling in Massachusetts, Ames built a seventeen-room estate in Tewksbury known locally as &quot;the Castle&quot; on Prospect Hill, now called Ames Hill, in 1906. In 1986, the Ames Hill Castle was purchased by local developer John D. Sullivan; Sullivan then illegally converted the house into a multi-unit rental property. However, Sullivan has been subject to several court rulings for zoning violations on the property, including one in 1991 and again in 1999. In August 2010, Sullivan&#x27;s attorney brought forth a proposal to Tewksbury&#x27;s board of selectmen for modifications to the Ames Hill Castle, to fall under the Massachusetts Comprehensive Permit Act: Chapter 40B, which would allow him to maintain the property as a multi-unit rental legally. The board elected unanimously to table the proposal, citing several concerns – both with Sullivan&#x27;s absence (as he had sent his attorney rather than present the proposal in person) and reluctance to meet with residents, and his previous legal issues with the property.

In March 2012, the Ames Hill Castle was unanimously voted &quot;preferably preserved&quot; by the Tewksbury Historic Commission due to its unique architectural features, the current state of preservation, and its association with General Ames. This allowed the commission to invoke a nine-month delay in possible demolition of the property to pursue alternatives. In November, local developer Marc Ginsburg purchased the Castle and surrounding plot from Sullivan for $360,000, just as the delay expired. Ginsburg ultimately decided on the Castle&#x27;s demolition to make way for smaller single-family dwellings.

==Popular culture==
Ames was portrayed by actor Matt Letscher in the 2003 film &quot;Gods and Generals&quot;.

<text>The mimids are the New World family of passerine birds, Mimidae, that includes thrashers, mockingbirds, tremblers, and the New World catbirds. As their name (Latin for &quot;mimic&quot;) suggests, these birds are notable for their vocalization, especially some species&#x27; remarkable ability to mimic a wide variety of birds and other sounds heard outdoors. They are commonly referred to as mimic thrushes but are not, in fact, thrushes (which are members of family Turdidae).

==Description==
There are over 30 species of mimids in two larger and some ten small or monotypic genera. They tend toward dull grays and browns in their appearance, though a few are black or blue-gray, and many have red, yellow, or white irises. They range from 20 to 33 centimetres in length, and 36 to 56 grams in weight. Many mimids have a rather thrush-like pattern: brown above, pale with dark streaks or spots below. They tend to have longer tails than thrushes (or the bigger wrens, which they also resemble) and longer bills that in many species curve downward.

They have long, strong legs (for passerines) with which many species hop through undergrowth searching for arthropods and fruits to eat. Their habitat varies from forest undergrowth to scrub, high-altitude grasslands, and deserts. The two tremblers live in the atypical habitat of rainforests in the Lesser Antilles, and the brown trembler has the particularly atypical behavior of foraging while clinging to tree trunks.

All known species build somewhat messy, bulky twig nests in dense growth, which are in most species on the ground or no more than 2 meters up. They usually lay 2 to 5 eggs that hatch in 12 or 13 days, which is also the length of time the chicks stay in the nest. Breeding usually starts in the spring or early in the rainy season, and many species can have two or even three broods per year. Most failures to fledge young are due to predation. Pairs often stay together for more than one breeding season.

==In the history of science==

Contrary to often-held belief, the &quot;Nesomimus&quot; mockingbirds may have played at least as great a role as Darwin&#x27;s finches in inspiring Darwin&#x27;s work on his theory of evolution.

== Systematics ==

===Outside the family===
Phylogenetic analyses have shown that mimids are most closely related to starlings. These and oxpeckers (and the Philippine creepers if they are not outright but highly apomorphic starlings) form a group of Muscicapoidea which originated probably in the Early Miocene – very roughly 25–20 mya – somewhere in East Asia. This is evidenced by the Asian-SW Pacific distribution of the most basal starlings (and Philippine creepers) and the North American range of the basal mimids.

They are sometimes united with the starlings in the Sturnidae as a tribe Mimini as proposed by Sibley &amp; Monroe (1990). This makes the expanded Sturnidae a rather noninformative group and is probably due to the methodological drawbacks of their DNA-DNA hybridization technique.

===Within the family===
The mockingbirds with some thrashers seem to form one major clade, while the two other groups and the remaining thrashers seem to form another, but the basal branching pattern is not well resolved. The tremblers, again, are a monophyletic lineage. The latter, however, are embedded in a paraphyletic catbird-Caribbean thrasher assemblage which consists of many rather basal lineages.

For detailed information on the evolutionary relationships of the different mimid lineages, see their articles.

<doc id="219374" wikidata="Q1059366" url="?curid=219374" title="Golden rectangle">
<text>In geometry, a golden rectangle is a rectangle with side lengths in golden ratio formula_1 or with approximately equal to or 

Golden rectangles exhibit a special form of self-similarity: if a square is added to the long side, or removed from the short side, the result is a golden rectangle as well.

==Construction==

Owing to the Pythagorean theorem, the diagonal dividing one half of a square equals the radius of a circle whose outermost point is the corner of a golden rectangle added to the square. Thus, a golden rectangle can be constructed with only a straightedge and compass in four steps:
# Draw a square
# Draw a line from the midpoint of one side of the square to an opposite corner
# Use that line as the radius to draw an arc that defines the height of the rectangle
# Complete the golden rectangle

A distinctive feature of this shape is that when a square section is added—or removed—the product is another golden rectangle, having the same aspect ratio as the first. Square addition or removal can be repeated infinitely, in which case corresponding corners of the squares form an infinite sequence of points on the golden spiral, the unique logarithmic spiral with this property. Diagonal lines drawn between the first two orders of embedded golden rectangles will define the intersection point of the diagonals of all the embedded golden rectangles; Clifford A. Pickover referred to this point as &quot;the Eye of God&quot;.

===Golden whirl===

Divide a square into four congruent right triangles with legs in ratio and arrange these in the shape of a golden rectangle, enclosing a similar rectangle that is scaled by factor and rotated about the centre by Repeating the construction at successively smaller scales results in four infinite sequences of adjoining right triangles, tracing a whirl of converging golden rectangles.

The logarithmic spiral through the vertices of adjacent triangles has polar slope formula_2 The parallelogram between the pair of upright grey triangles has perpendicular diagonals in ratio , hence is a golden rhombus.

If the triangle has legs of lengths and then each discrete spiral has length formula_3 The areas of the triangles in each spiral region sum to formula_4 the perimeters are equal to (grey) and (yellow regions).

==History==
The proportions of the golden rectangle have been observed as early as the Babylonian &quot;Tablet of Shamash&quot; , though Mario Livio calls any knowledge of the golden ratio before the Ancient Greeks &quot;doubtful&quot;.

According to Livio, since the publication of Luca Pacioli&#x27;s &quot;Divina proportione&quot; in 1509, &quot;the Golden Ratio started to become available to artists in theoretical treatises that were not overly mathematical, that they could actually use.&quot;

The 1927 Villa Stein designed by Le Corbusier, some of whose architecture utilizes the golden ratio, features dimensions that closely approximate golden rectangles.

==Relation to regular polygons and polyhedra==
Euclid gives an alternative construction of the golden rectangle using three polygons circumscribed by congruent circles: a regular decagon, hexagon, and pentagon. The respective lengths &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; of the sides of these three polygons satisfy the equation &quot;a&quot;2 + &quot;b&quot;2 = &quot;c&quot;2, so line segments with these lengths form a right triangle (by the converse of the Pythagorean theorem). The ratio of the side length of the hexagon to the decagon is the golden ratio, so this triangle forms half of a golden rectangle.

The convex hull of two opposite edges of a regular icosahedron forms a golden rectangle. The twelve vertices of the icosahedron can be decomposed in this way into three mutually-perpendicular golden rectangles, whose boundaries are linked in the pattern of the Borromean rings.

==Relation to angles of the golden triangle==
Assume a golden rectangle has been constructed as indicated above, with height , length and diagonal length formula_5. The triangles on the diagonal have altitudes formula_6 each perpendicular foot divides the diagonal in ratio 

If an horizontal line is drawn through the intersection point of the diagonal and the internal edge of the square, the original golden rectangle and the two scaled copies along the diagonal have linear sizes in the ratios formula_7 the square and rectangle opposite the diagonal both have areas equal to 

Relative to vertex , the coordinates of feet of altitudes and are formula_8 and formula_9; the length of line segment is equal to altitude 

If the diagram is further subdivided by perpendicular lines through and , the lengths of the diagonal and its subsections can be expressed as trigonometric functions of arguments 72 and 36 degrees, the angles of the golden triangle:
:formula_10

:with 

Both the lengths of the diagonal sections and the trigonometric values are elements of quartic number field formula_11

The golden rhombus with edge has diagonal lengths equal to and The regular pentagon with side length formula_12 has area Its five diagonals divide the pentagon into golden triangles and gnomons, and an upturned, scaled copy at the centre. Since the regular pentagon is defined by its side length and the angles of the golden triangle, it follows that all measures can be expressed in powers of and the diagonal segments of the golden rectangle, as illustrated above.
Interpreting the diagonal sections as musical string lengths results in a set of ten corres­ponding pitches, one of which doubles at the octave. Mapping the intervals in logarithmic scale — with the &#x27;golden octave&#x27; equal to — shows equally tempered semitones, minor thirds and one major second in the span of an eleventh. An analysis in musical terms is substantiated by the single exceptional pitch proportional to , that approximates the harmonic seventh within remarkable one cent accuracy.

This set of ten tones can be partitioned into two modes of the pentatonic scale: the palindromic &#x27;Egyptian&#x27; mode (red dots, Chinese guqin tuning) and the stately &#x27;blues minor&#x27; mode (blue dots, Chinese tuning).

<doc id="219378" wikidata="Q720541" url="?curid=219378" title="Mockingbird">
<text>Mockingbirds are a group of New World passerine birds from the family Mimidae. They are best known for the habit of some species mimicking the songs of other birds and the sounds of insects and amphibians, often loudly and in rapid succession and for being extremely territorial when raising hatchlings. Studies have shown the ability of some species to identify individual humans and treat them differently based on learned threat assessments.

The only mockingbird commonly found in North America is the northern mockingbird. Mockingbirds are known for singing late at night, even past midnight.

They are opportunistic omnivores, feeding on insects, fruits, seeds, and occasional greens. 
The northern mockingbird is the state bird of five states in the United States, a trend that was started in 1920, when the Texas Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs proposed the idea. In January 1927, Governor Dan Moody approved this, and Texas became the first state ever to choose a state bird. Since then, Arkansas, Florida, Mississippi, and Tennessee have also adopted the Northern Mockingbird as their official state bird.

==Taxonomy==
There are about 17 species in two genera, although three species of mockingbird from the Galápagos Islands were formerly separated into a third genus, &quot;Nesomimus&quot;. The mockingbirds do not appear to form a monophyletic lineage, as &quot;Mimus&quot; and &quot;Melanotis&quot; are not each other&#x27;s closest relatives; instead, &quot;Melanotis&quot; appears to be more closely related to the catbirds, while the closest living relatives of &quot;Mimus&quot; appear to be thrashers, such as the sage thrasher.

==Species in taxonomic order==
&quot;Mimus&quot;:
* Brown-backed mockingbird, &quot;Mimus dorsalis&quot;
* Bahama mockingbird, &quot;Mimus gundlachii&quot;
* Long-tailed mockingbird, &quot;Mimus longicaudatus&quot;
* Patagonian mockingbird, &quot;Mimus patagonicus&quot;
* Chilean mockingbird, &quot;Mimus thenca&quot;
* White-banded mockingbird, &quot;Mimus triurus&quot;
* Northern mockingbird, &quot;Mimus polyglottos&quot;
* Socorro mockingbird, &quot;Mimus graysoni&quot;
* Tropical mockingbird, &quot;Mimus gilvus&quot;
* Chalk-browed mockingbird, &quot;Mimus saturninus&quot;
Formerly &quot;Nesomimus&quot; (endemic to the Galapagos):
* Hood mockingbird, &quot;Mimus macdonaldi&quot;
* Galápagos mockingbird, &quot;Mimus parvulus&quot;
* Floreana mockingbird or Charles mockingbird, &quot;Mimus trifasciatus&quot;
* San Cristóbal mockingbird, &quot;Mimus melanotis&quot;
&quot;Melanotis&quot;:
* Blue mockingbird, &quot;Melanotis caerulescens&quot; tite
* Blue-and-white mockingbird, &quot;Melanotis hypoleucus&quot;

==Charles Darwin==
When the survey voyage of HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; visited the Galápagos Islands in September to October 1835, the naturalist Charles Darwin noticed that the mockingbirds &quot;Mimus thenca&quot; differed from island to island, and were closely allied in appearance to mockingbirds on the South American mainland. Nearly a year later when writing up his notes on the return voyage he speculated that this, together with what he had been told about Galápagos tortoises, could undermine the doctrine of stability of species. This was his first recorded expression of doubts about species being immutable, which led to his being convinced about the transmutation of species and hence evolution.

<text>Ridgley Ceylon Powers (December 24, 1836 – November 11, 1912) was a U.S. Army officer in the American Civil War who was Mississippi&#x27;s lieutenant governor in 1870 before becoming Governor from 1871 to 1874. He succeeded James L. Alcorn as Governor when Alcorn resigned to become a U.S. senator.

==Background==
Powers was born in Mecca, Ohio, on Christmas Eve. He graduated from the University of Michigan and completed post-graduate work at Union College in Schenectady, New York, in 1862.

==Wartime==
In the second year of the American Civil War, Powers enlisted into the United States Army as a private. He became a second lieutenant and later a captain in the 125th Ohio Volunteer Infantry. He fought in the Third Battle of Chattanooga and in the Atlanta Campaign before returning with his regiment to Tennessee for much of the remainder of the war. He ended his military service as a colonel at the end of the conflict.

==Governorship==
In 1865, Powers settled in Noxubee County, Mississippi, as a cotton planter, later becoming Sheriff. During Reconstruction, he was elected the seventh lieutenant governor and began his term in 1870. Governor James L. Alcorn resigned the following year to accept a U.S. Senate seat, thereby making Powers the acting governor; he finished the unexpired term ending in 1874.

==Death==
Powers died in Los Angeles, California in 1912.

<text>Thrashers are a New World group of passerine birds related to mockingbirds and New World catbirds. Like these, they are in the family Mimidae. There are 15 species in one large and 4 monotypic genera.

These do not form a clade but are a phenetic assemblage. It is more likely than not — though by no means robustly supported — that the sage thrasher is a basal lineage among a group also consisting of mockingbirds and &quot;Toxostoma&quot; thrashers. The Caribbean thrashers occupy varying positions in an assemblage consisting of them, the tremblers, and the New World catbirds. Here, the white-breasted thrasher appears to be quite basal though it is impossible to place it anywhere with certainty, whereas the pearly-eyed thrasher is probably quite close to the tremblers. (Hunt &quot;et al.&quot; 2001, Barber &quot;et al.&quot; 2004)

Their common name describes the behaviour of these birds when searching for food on the ground: they use their long bills to &quot;thrash&quot; through dirt or dead leaves. All of these birds eat insects and several species also eat berries.

<text>The Battle of Manila Bay (; ), also known as the Battle of Cavite, took place on May 1, 1898, during the Spanish–American War. The American Asiatic Squadron under Commodore George Dewey engaged and destroyed the Spanish Pacific Squadron under &quot;Contraalmirante&quot; (Rear admiral) Patricio Montojo. The battle took place in Manila Bay in the Philippines, and was the first major engagement of the Spanish–American War. The battle was one of the most decisive naval battles in history and marked the end of the Spanish colonial period in Philippine history.

Tensions between Spain and the United States worsened over the Spanish conduct during their efforts to quell the Cuban War of Independence, with many Americans being agitated by largely falsified reports of Spanish atrocities against the Cuban population. In January 1898, fearing the fate of American interests in Cuba due to the war, the cruiser was dispatched to protect them. Less than a month later, the cruiser exploded while lying at anchor in Havana harbor, killing 261 sailors onboard and inflaming American opinion.

Upon the outbreak of war, the Americans realized that defeating a significant Spanish squadron then stationed in the Philippines was important to ensuring victory in the war. The U.S. Asiatic Squadron commanded by Dewey, a veteran of the American Civil War, was dispatched to ensure success. On 1 May, the American squadron steamed into Manila Bay to engage with the Spanish. The Spanish, aware that they were hopelessly outgunned, made a desperate defense against the Americans. The battle was not much of a contest, with superior American naval gunnery and seamanship ensuring the entire Spanish fleet would be sunk with minimal casualties for the Americans, who suffered only ten casualties in all. Upon realising that the battle was hopeless, Montojo ordered his two protected cruisers to be scuttled to ensure that they did not fall into the hands of the Americans. The battle remains one of the most significant naval battles in American maritime history.

==Prelude==
Americans living on the West Coast of the United States feared a Spanish attack at the outbreak of the Spanish–American War. Only a few U.S. Navy warships, led by the cruiser , stood between them and a powerful Spanish fleet. In practice, however, &quot; Olympia&quot; was far superior to the Spanish colonial fleet, as the battle would show.

Admiral Montojo, a career Spanish naval officer who had been dispatched rapidly to the Philippines, was equipped with a variety of obsolete vessels. Efforts to strengthen his position amounted to little. The strategy adopted by the Spanish bureaucracy suggested they could not win a war and saw resistance as little more than a face-saving exercise. Administrative actions worked against the effort, sending explosives meant for naval mines to civilian construction companies while the Spanish fleet in Manila was seriously undermanned by inexperienced sailors who had not received any training for over a year. Reinforcements promised from Madrid resulted in only two poorly-armored scout cruisers being sent while at the same time the authorities transferred a squadron from the Manila fleet under Admiral Pascual Cervera to reinforce the Caribbean. Admiral Montojo had originally wanted to confront the Americans at Subic Bay, northwest of Manila Bay, but abandoned that idea when he learned the planned mines and coastal defenses were lacking and the cruiser started to leak. Montojo compounded his difficulties by placing his ships outside the range of Spanish coastal artillery (which might have evened the odds) and choosing a relatively shallow anchorage. His intent seems to have been to spare Manila from bombardment and to allow any survivors of his fleet to swim to safety. The harbor was protected by six shore batteries and three forts whose fire during the battle proved to be ineffective. Only Fort San Antonio Abad had guns with enough range to reach the American fleet, but Dewey never came within their range during the battle.

The Spanish squadron consisted of seven ships: the cruisers (flagship), &quot;Castilla&quot;, , , , , and the gunboat . The Spanish ships were of inferior quality to the American ships; the &quot;Castilla&quot; was unpowered and had to be towed by the transport ship &quot;Manila&quot;. On 25 April, the squadron left Manila Bay for the port of Subic, intending to mount a defense there. The squadron was relying on a shore battery which was to be installed on Isla Grande. On 28 April, before that installation could be completed, a cablegram from the Spanish Consul in Hong Kong arrived with the information that the American squadron had left Hong Kong bound for Subic for the purpose of destroying the Spanish squadron and intending to proceed from there to Manila. The Spanish Council of Commanders, with the exception of the Commander of Subic, felt that no defense of Subic was possible with the state of things, and that the squadron should transfer back to Manila, positioning in shallow water so that the ships could be run aground to save the lives of the crews as a final resort. The squadron departed Subic at 10:30 a.m. on 29 April. &quot;Manila&quot;, towing &quot;Castilla&quot;, was last to arrive in Manila Bay, at midnight.

==Battle==
At 7 p.m. on 30 April, Montojo was informed that Dewey&#x27;s ships had been seen in Subic Bay that afternoon. As Manila Bay was considered unnavigable at night by foreigners, Montojo expected an attack the following morning. However, Oscar F. Williams, the United States Consul in Manila, had provided Dewey with detailed information on the state of the Spanish defenses and the lack of preparedness of the Spanish fleet. Based in part upon this intelligence, Dewey—embarked aboard &quot;Olympia&quot;—led his squadron into Manila Bay at midnight on 30 April.

Passing the entrance, two Spanish mines exploded but were ineffective as they were well below the draft of any of the ships due to the depth of the water. Inside the bay, ships normally used the north channel between Corregidor Island and the northern coast, and this was the only channel mined. Dewey instead used the unmined south channel between El Fraile and Caballo Islands. The El Fraile battery fired a few rounds but the range was too great. The , and were then detached from the line and took no further part in the fighting. At 5:15 a.m. on 1 May, the squadron was off Manila and the Cavite battery fired ranging shots. The shore batteries and Spanish fleet then opened fire but all the shells fell short as the fleet was still out of range. At 5:41 with the now famous phrase, &quot;You may fire when ready, Gridley&quot;, the &quot;Olympia&quot;″s captain was instructed to begin the destruction of the Spanish flotilla.

The U.S. squadron swung in front of the Spanish ships and forts in line ahead, firing their port guns. They then turned and passed back, firing their starboard guns. This process was repeated five times, each time closing the range from 5,000 yards to 2,000 yards. The Spanish forces had been alerted, and most were ready for action, but they were heavily outgunned. Eight Spanish ships, the land batteries, and the forts returned fire for two and a half hours although the range was too great for the guns on shore. Five other small Spanish ships were not engaged.

Montojo accepted that his cause was hopeless and ordered his ships to ram the enemy if possible. He then slipped the &quot;Cristina&#x27;s&quot; cables and charged. Much of the American fleet&#x27;s fire was then directed at her and she was shot to pieces. Of the crew of 400, more than 200, including Montojo, were casualties and only two men remained who were able to man her guns. The ship managed to return to shore and Montojo ordered it to be scuttled. The &quot;Castilla&quot;, which only had guns on the port side, had her forward cable shot away, causing her to swing about, presenting her weaponless starboard side. The captain then ordered her sunk and abandoned. The &quot;Ulloa&quot; was hit by a shell at the waterline that killed her captain and disabled half the crew. The &quot;Luzon&quot; had three guns out of action but was otherwise unharmed. The &quot;Duero&quot; lost an engine and had only one gun left able to fire.

At 7:45 a.m., after Captain Gridley messaged Dewey that only 15 rounds of 5&quot; ammunition remained per gun, Dewey ordered an immediate withdrawal. To preserve morale, he informed the crews that the halt in the battle was to allow the crews to have breakfast. According to an observer on the &quot;Olympia&quot;, &quot;At least three of his (Spanish) ships had broken into flames but so had one of ours. These fires had all been put out without apparent injury to the ships. Generally speaking, nothing of great importance had occurred to show that we had seriously injured any Spanish vessel.&quot; Montojo took the opportunity to now move his remaining ships into Bacoor Bay where they were ordered to resist for as long as possible.

A captains&#x27; conference on the &quot;Olympia&quot; revealed little damage and no men killed. It was discovered that the original ammunition message had been garbled—instead of only 15 rounds of ammunition per gun remaining, the message had meant to say only 15 rounds of ammunition per gun had been expended. Reports arrived during the conference that sounds of exploding ammunition had been heard and fires sighted on the &quot;Cristina&quot; and &quot;Castilla&quot;. At 10:40 a.m. action was resumed but the Spanish offered little resistance, and Montojo issued orders for the remaining ships to be scuttled and the breechblocks of their guns taken ashore. The &quot;Olympia&quot;, &quot;Baltimore&quot; and &quot;Boston&quot; then fired on the Sangley Point battery putting it out of action and followed up by sinking the &quot;Ulloa&quot;. The &quot;Concord&quot; fired on the transport &quot;Mindanao&quot;, whose crew immediately abandoned ship. The fired on the government offices next to the arsenal and a white flag was raised over the building after which all firing ceased. The Spanish colors were struck at 12:40 p.m.

According to American sources, Dewey won the battle with seven men very slightly wounded, a total of nine injured, and only a single fatality among his crew: Francis B. Randall, Chief Engineer on the &quot;McCulloch&quot;, from a heart attack. On the other hand, the Spanish naval historian Agustín Ramón Rodríguez González suggests that Dewey suffered heavier losses, though still much lower than those of the Spanish squadron. Rodríguez notes that Spanish officials estimated the American casualties at 13 crewmen killed and more than 30 wounded based on reliable information collected by the Spanish consulate in Hong Kong. According to Rodríguez, Dewey may have concealed the deaths and injuries by including the numbers among the 155 men who reportedly deserted during the campaign.

==Subsequent action==
A Spanish attempt to attack Dewey with the naval task force known as Camara&#x27;s Flying Relief Column came to naught, and the naval war in the Philippines devolved into a series of torpedo boat hit-and-run attacks for the rest of the campaign. While the Spanish scored several hits, there were no American fatalities directly attributable to Spanish gunfire.

On 2 May, Dewey landed a force of Marines at Cavite. They completed the destruction of the Spanish fleet and batteries and established a guard for the protection of the Spanish hospitals. The resistance of the forts was weak. The &quot;Olympia&quot; turned a few guns on the Cavite arsenal, detonating its magazine, and ending the fire from the Spanish batteries.

Dewey cabled Washington that he controlled the bay but would need 5,000 additional men to seize the city. The completeness of the victory in the opening stages of the war prompted President McKinley to send additional troops to seize the city. After some consideration, the U.S. War Department began assembling a force of 20,000 volunteers and regulars. In the meantime, before these forces arrived, Dewey returned Emilio Aguinaldo to Manila from exile in Hong Kong, and Aguinaldo retindered the Philippine Revolution seeking independence from Spain.

==Aftermath==
In recognition of George Dewey&#x27;s leadership during the Battle of Manila Bay, a special medal known as the Dewey Medal was presented to the officers and sailors under Admiral Dewey&#x27;s command. Dewey was later honored with promotion to the special rank of Admiral of the Navy. Building on his popularity, Dewey briefly ran for president in 1900, but withdrew and endorsed William McKinley, the incumbent, who won. The same year Dewey was appointed President of the General Board of the United States Navy, where he would play a key role in the growth of the U.S. Navy until his death in January 1917.

Dewey Square in Boston is named after Commodore Dewey, as is Dewey Beach, Delaware. Union Square, San Francisco features a tall monument to Admiral George Dewey&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Manila Bay.

==Order of battle==

Despite the superiority of the American artillery, the success rate of their guns was minimal, a total of 5,859 shells were expended during the battle. Excluding shells fired at land targets and the unengaged vessels, only 145 hit the seven Spanish engaged vessels. The &quot;Reina Cristina&quot; and &quot;Castilla&quot; suffered 81 hits between them, the &quot;Don Antonio de Ulloa&quot; was hit 33 times, the &quot;Don Juan de Austria&quot; 13, the &quot;Marques del Duero&quot; 10, the &quot;Isla de Cuba&quot; five and the &quot;Isla de Luzón&quot; was hit three times.

Unengaged vessels:
* The Revenue Cutter , the collier and the steamer (a supply vessel) were directed to keep out of the main action because of their light armament and lack of armor. The &quot;McCulloch&quot;″s chief engineer, Francis B. Randall, died of a heart attack.

The Spanish vessels had 19 torpedo tubes between them but no serviceable torpedoes.

Shore Defenses
* Fort San Antonio Abad: Built 1584. Located in Manila. Various guns with only the 9.4-inch having enough range to reach Dewey&#x27;s ships at their closest approach.
* Fort San Felipe: Built 1609. A small castle built on a sandbar protected by a breakwater and separated from Cavite City by a moat.
* Cavite Fort: Fortified naval base and shipyard in Cavite City located adjacent to Fort San Felipe.
* Corregidor battery: Entrance to Manila Bay. Did not fire.
* Caballo battery: Entrance to Manila Bay. Did not fire.
* El Fraile battery: Entrance to Manila Bay. Fired three rounds before &quot;Raleigh&quot; silenced it after hitting the battery with a single shell.
* Cañacao battery: Located in the town of Cañacao. Armed with a single 4.7-inch gun. Did not fire.
* Sangley Point battery: Located at the Sangley Point Naval Base. Armed with three 64-lb muzzleloading cannon and two 5.9-inch guns (which were the only ones to fire.)

<text>British North America comprised the colonial territories of the British Empire in North America from 1783 onwards. English colonisation of North America began in the 16th century in Newfoundland, then further south at Roanoke and Jamestown, Virginia, and more substantially with the founding of the Thirteen Colonies along the Atlantic coast of North America.

The British Empire&#x27;s colonial territories in North America were greatly expanded by the Treaty of Paris (1763), which formally concluded the Seven Years&#x27; War, referred to by the English colonies in North America as the French and Indian War, and by the French colonies as . With the ultimate acquisition of most of New France (), British territory in North America was more than doubled in size, and the exclusion of France also dramatically altered the political landscape of the continent.

The term &quot;British America&quot; was used to refer to the British Empire&#x27;s colonial territories in North America prior to the United States Declaration of Independence, most famously in the 1774 address of Thomas Jefferson to the First Continental Congress entitled: &quot;A Summary View of the Rights of British America&quot;.

The term &quot;British North America&quot; was initially used following the subsequent 1783 Treaty of Paris, which concluded the American Revolutionary War and confirmed the independence of Great Britain&#x27;s Thirteen Colonies that formed the United States of America. The terms British America and British North America continued to be used for Britain&#x27;s remaining territories in North America, but the term British North America came to be used more consistently in connection with the provinces that would eventually form the Dominion of Canada, following the Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839), called the Durham Report.

The Dominion of Canada was formed under the British North America (BNA) Act, 1867, also referred to as the Constitution Act, 1867. Following royal assent of the BNA Act, three of the provinces of British North America (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and the Province of Canada (which would become the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec)) joined to form &quot;One Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with a Constitution similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom,&quot; on July 1, 1867, the date of Canadian Confederation.

The Atlantic island of Bermuda (originally administered by the Virginia Company and, with The Bahamas, considered with North America prior to 1783), was grouped with the Maritime provinces from 1783, but after the formation of the Dominion of Canada in 1867 and the achievement of dominion status by the colony of Newfoundland in 1907, Bermuda was thereafter administered generally with the colonies in the British West Indies (although the Church of England continued to place Bermuda under the Bishop of Newfoundland until 1919).

Over its duration, British North America comprised the British Empire&#x27;s colonial territories in North America from 1783 to 1907, not including the Caribbean. These territories include those forming modern-day Canada and Bermuda, having also ceded what became all or large parts of six Midwestern U.S. states (Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and the northeastern part of Minnesota), which were formed out of the Northwest Territory, large parts of Maine, which had originally been within the French territory of Acadia, and very briefly, East Florida, West Florida, and the Bahamas.

==Political divisions==


When the Kingdom of England began its efforts to cross the Atlantic Ocean and settle in eastern North America in the late 16th century, it ignored the Kingdom of Spain&#x27;s long-asserted claim of sovereignty over the entire continent as part of its world-wide Spanish Empire. Spain&#x27;s similar claim to all of South America had been refuted when the Pope Alexander VI had divided the twin continents of the Americas between Spain and the Kingdom of Portugal in the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas. Spain&#x27;s area of settlement was limited to only the very southern and southwestern parts and coastal edges of the continent of North America, however, and it had little ability to enforce its sovereignty. Disregarding, as did Spain, the sovereignty of the indigenous nations, England claimed the entire North America continent at this point (though its western, northern, and southern boundaries were ill-defined, vague, and not yet clear), which it named &quot;Virginia&quot; in honour of the virgin queen, Elizabeth I (1533–1603, reigned 1558–1603).

England&#x27;s first successful settlement in North America was Jamestown, established by the Virginia Company of London in 1607, with the second being the Atlantic Ocean archipelago of Bermuda (or the &quot;Somers Isles&quot;), added to the territory of the same company in 1612 (the company having been in occupation of the archipelago since the 1609 wreck there of its flagship, the Sea Venture). Two areas of settlement in North America had been laid out in 1606, with the name &quot;Virginia&quot; coming to connote the southern area, between Latitude 34° and Latitude 41° North, administered by the Virginia Company of London. The short form of that company&#x27;s name was the &quot;London Company&quot;, but it came to be known popularly as the &quot;Virginia Company&quot;. The northern area of settlement, which extended to 45° North (an area that would come to be known as New England), was to be administered and settled by the Virginia Company of Plymouth (or Plymouth Company), which established the Popham Colony in what is now Maine in 1606, but this was quickly abandoned and Plymouth Company&#x27;s territory was absorbed into the London Company&#x27;s.

Over the course of the 17th century, &quot;Virginia&quot; would come to refer only to the polity that is today the Commonwealth of Virginia on the East Coast of the United States of America, with later areas of settlement on the continent considered separate colonies under their own local administrations and all collectively designated as &quot;America&quot; (less often as &quot;North America&quot;). The Kingdom of England (including the adjacent Principality of Wales) and the Kingdom of Scotland remained separate nations until their 1707 unification to form the Kingdom of Great Britain (1707–1801). Scotland&#x27;s attempts to establish its own colonies in North America and Central America before 1707 had been short-lived, but England brought substantial trans-Atlantic possessions into the new union when English America became British America. In 1775, on the eve of the American Revolution and parallel. American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). British America included territories in the Western Hemisphere northeast of New Spain, apart from the islands and claims of the British West Indies in the larger West Indies islands chain in the Caribbean Sea, near the Gulf of Mexico. These were:

* Bermuda
* British Arctic Territories
* The Floridas (East and West Florida, administered separately)
* Indian Reserve
* Newfoundland
* North-Western Territory
* Nova Scotia
* Quebec
* Rupert&#x27;s Land (the territory of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company)
* St. John&#x27;s Island (later Prince Edward Island)
* Thirteen Colonies (each one administered separately, soon to become the United States):
** Connecticut Colony
** Delaware Colony
** Province of Georgia
** Province of Maryland
** Province of Massachusetts Bay
** Province of New Hampshire
** Province of New Jersey
** Province of New York
** Province of North Carolina
** Province of Pennsylvania
** Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations
** Province of South Carolina
** Colony of Virginia

===Bermuda===
The Somers Isles, or Bermuda, had been occupied by the Virginia Company since its flagship, the &quot;Sea Venture&quot;, was wrecked there in 1609, and the archipelago was officially added to the company&#x27;s territory in 1612, then managed by a spin-off, the Somers Isles Company, until 1684, but maintained close links with Virginia and Carolina Colony (which had subsequently been settled from Bermuda under William Sayle in 1670). The British Government originally grouped Bermuda with North America (the archipelago is approximately east-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina (with &quot;Cape Point&quot; on Hatteras Island being the nearest landfall); south of Cape Sable Island, Nova Scotia; northeast of Cuba, and due north of the British Virgin Islands.
Although Bermudians, with close ties of blood and trade to the southern continental American colonies (especially Virginia and South Carolina), tended towards the rebels early in the American Revolutionary War / American War of Independence (1775–1783), the control of the adjacent and surrounding Atlantic Ocean by the British Royal Navy meant there was no likelihood of the colony joining the rebellion. Although the rebels were supplied with ships and gunpowder by the Bermudians, Bermudian privateers soon turned aggressively on rebel shipping. After the acknowledgement by the British Government of the independence of the former thirteen rebellious continental colonies in the negotiated Treaty of Paris of 1783, finally recognizing the independence of the new United States of America which it originally declared on July 4, 1776. Bermuda was grouped regionally by the British Government with The Maritimes and Newfoundland and Labrador provinces of modern eastern Canada, and, more widely, with British North America.

Following the world-wide war, the Royal Navy spent a dozen years of peace-time charting the barrier reef around Bermuda to discover the channel that enabled access to the northern lagoon, the Great Sound, and Hamilton Harbour. Once this had been located, a base was established (initially at St. George&#x27;s before the construction of the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda) in 1794, when Vice-Admiral Sir George Murray, Commander-in-Chief of the new River St. Lawrence and Coast of America and North America and West Indies Station, set up the first Admiralty House, Bermuda at Rose Hill, St. George&#x27;s. In 1813, the area of command became the &quot;North America Station&quot; again, with the West Indies falling under the Jamaica Station, and in 1816 it was renamed the &quot;North America and Lakes of Canada Station&quot;. The headquarters was initially in Bermuda during the winter and Halifax during the summer (both of which were designated as Imperial fortresses, along with Gibraltar and Malta), but Bermuda, became the year-round headquarters of the Station in 1821, when the area of command became the &quot;North America and West Indies Station&quot;. The Royal Naval Dockyard, Halifax, was finally transferred to the Government of the Dominion of Canada in 1907.

Before 1784, the Bermuda Garrison had been placed under the military Commander-in-Chief America in New York during the American War of Independence. A small regular infantry garrison had existed from 1701 to 1768, alongside the militia, and part of the Royal Garrison Battalion had been stationed there in 1778 but that battalion was disbanded in Bermuda in 1784. The regular military garrison was re-established at Bermuda in 1794 by part of the British Army&#x27;s 47th Regiment of Foot and the Board of Ordnance also stationed an invalid company of the Royal Artillery there soon after. The Bermuda garrison was to be part of the Nova Scotia Command until 1869 (in 1815, Lieutenant-General Sir George Prevost was &quot;Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief in and over the Provinces of Upper-Canada, Lower-Canada, Nova-Scotia, and New-Brunswick, and their several Dependencies, Vice-Admiral of the same, Lieutenant-General and Commander of all His Majesty&#x27;s Forces in the said Provinces of Lower Canada and Upper-Canada, Nova-Scotia and New-Brunswick, and their several Dependencies, and in the islands of Newfoundland, Prince Edward, Cape Breton and the Bermudas, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.&quot; Beneath Prevost, the staff of the British Army in &quot;the Provinces of Nova-Scotia, New-Brunswick, and their Dependencies, including the Islands of Newfoundland, Cape Breton, Prince Edward and Bermuda&quot; were under the Command of Lieutenant-General Sir John Coape Sherbrooke. Below Sherbrooke, the Bermuda Garrison was under the immediate control of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bermuda, Major General George Horsford).), and was expanded greatly during the 19th century, both to defend the colony as a naval base and to launch amphibious operations against the Atlantic coast of the United States in any war that should transpire.

The Royal Navy, British Army, Royal Marines, and Colonial Marines forces based in Bermuda carried out actions of this sort during the subsequent American / Canadian War of 1812 (1812–1815), the North American phase of the larger Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815), elsewhere in Europe and the world, versus Napoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821), of France. When the Royal Navy&#x27;s blockade of the Atlantic seaboard of the United States was orchestrated from Bermuda (In the New England region, where support for the United States Government&#x27;s war against Britain was low and from which Britain continued to purchase and receive grain to feed its army engaged in the Peninsular War in Spain and Portugal, was at first excluded from this blockade). In 1813, Lieutenant-Colonel, Sir Thomas Sydney Beckwith arrived in Bermuda to command an expeditionary force tasked with raiding the Atlantic Seaboard of the United States, specifically in the region of the Chesapeake Bay and surrounding coasts of Maryland and Virginia. The force was to be composed of the infantry battalion then on garrison duty in Bermuda, the 102nd Regiment of Foot (with its Commanding Officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Charles James Napier as Second-in-Command) forming one brigade with Royal Marines and a unit recruited from French prisoners-of-war, which was under Lt. Col. Napier&#x27;s command, and another brigade formed under Lieutenant-Colonel Williams of the Royal Marines. The force took part in the Battle of Craney Island on 22 June 1813. The most famous action carried out during the war by forces from Bermuda was the Chesapeake Campaign of 1813 and later 1814, including the Battle of Bladensburg northeast outside Washington, D.C. with the subsequent Burning of Washington in August 1814, retribution for the &quot;wanton destruction of private property along the north shores of Lake Erie&quot; by American forces under Col. John Campbell in May 1814, the most notable being the Raid on Port Dover to draw United States forces away from the Canadian border. In 1828, His Excellency George, Earl of Dalhousie, (Baron Dalhousie, of Dalhousie Castle,) Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath was &quot;Captain General and Governor in Chief in and over the Provinces of Lower-Canada, Upper-Canada, Nova-Scotia, and New-Brunswick, and their several dependencies, Vice-Admiral of the same, Lieutenant-General and Commander of all His Majesty&#x27;s Forces in the said Provinces, and their several dependencies, and in the Islands of Newfoundland, Prince Edward, and Bermuda, &amp;c. &amp;c c. &amp;c.&quot; Beneath Dalhousie, the &quot;Provinces of Nova-Scotia, New-Brunswick, and their Dependencies, including the Island of Newfoundland, Cape Breton, Prince Edward and Bermuda&quot; were under the Command of His Excellency Lieutenant-General Sir James Kempt GCB, GCH&quot;.

The established Church of England in Bermuda (since 1978, titled the Anglican Church of Bermuda) and Newfoundland was attached to the See of Nova Scotia from 1825 to 1839 and from 1787 to 1839, respectively. From 1839, the island of Newfoundland and the coast of Labrador, as well as Bermuda, became parts of the Diocese of Newfoundland and Bermuda, with the shared Bishop (Aubrey George Spencer being the first) alternating his residence between the two colonies. A separate Bermuda Synod was incorporated in 1879, but continued to share its Bishop with Newfoundland until 1919, when the separate position of Bishop of Bermuda was created (in 1949, on Newfoundland becoming a province of Canada, the Diocese of Newfoundland became part of the Anglican Church of Canada; the Church of England in Bermuda, which was re-titled the &quot;Anglican Church of Bermuda&quot; in 1978, is today one of six extra-provincial Anglican churches within the Church of England overseen by the Archbishop of Canterbury in Canterbury, England).

Other denominations also at one time included Bermuda with Nova Scotia or Canada. Following the separation of the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century of the English Reformation period, Roman Catholic worship was outlawed in England (subsequently &quot;Britain&quot;) and its colonies, including Bermuda, until the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791, and operated thereafter under restrictions until the 20th 
century. Once Roman Catholic worship was allowed and reestablished, Bermuda formed part of the Archdiocese of Halifax, Nova Scotia, until 1953, when it was separated to become the Apostolic Prefecture of Bermuda Islands. The congregation of the first African Methodist Episcopal Church in Bermuda (St. John African Methodist Episcopal Church, erected in 1885 in Hamilton Parish) had previously been part of the British Methodist Episcopal Church of Canada.

===New France (Nouvelle-France)===
The Kingdom of Great Britain acquired most of Acadia or Acadie, Nouvelle-France, in connection with the Queen Anne&#x27;s War of 1702–1713, and subsequent lands later, after the Seven Years&#x27; War / French and Indian War (1753/1756-1763). These territories would become the future provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, as well as parts of Quebec in the modern Dominion of Canada and additional territories that would eventually form part of the old Massachusetts Bay Colony, later after 1776 as the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and later separated to form the State of Maine in 1820, in the United States.

Britain acquired much of the remainder of Canada (New France) and the eastern half of Louisiana, including West Florida, from the Kingdom of France, and East Florida from the Kingdom of Spain, by the earlier 1763 Treaty of Paris (1763), which ended the Seven Years&#x27; War (in Europe) / French and Indian War (in North America). Spain had not taken possession of any of Spanish Louisiana, which had been ceded to it under the earlier secret Treaty of Fontainebleau of 1762, from France of French Louisiana until seven years later in 1769. By the terms of the later Treaty of Paris (1783), the United States acquired the southern and western portions of the former Royal French colony in the interior of the North American continent of New France / (later Quebec), south of the Great Lakes to the Ohio River and west to the Mississippi River. At the same time that Spain gained along the Gulf of Mexico coastline of West Florida (western panhandle of Florida) and regained again East Florida (of the Florida peninsula), forming Spanish Florida until its 1813 / 1819 cession to the adjacent United States.

Nova Scotia was split into modern-day Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in 1784. The part of Quebec retained after 1783 was split into the primarily French-speaking Province of Lower Canada (future Quebec) and the primarily English-speaking Province of Upper Canada (future Ontario) in 1791. Later the two provinces north of the Great Lakes of the British Empire were combined in 1841 as the Province of Canada (also known as the United Provinces of Canada or the United Canada). This lasted a quarter-century until 1867 and the passage of the British North America Act by the British Parliament in London, with the then establishment of the modern Dominion of Canada.

After the War of 1812 (1812–1815), the Treaty of 1818 established the east/west 49th parallel, north of latitude as the United States–British North America international border, extending from Rupert&#x27;s Land (north of the Great Lakes) further west to the edge of the Rocky Mountains. Then 28 years later, in the subsequent 1846 treaty, Britain and the United States split the jointly-administered Oregon Country lands of the Pacific Northwest region between the Americans and the British, extending the 49th parallel line further west to the Puget Sound. The United States was assigned lands south of the 49th parallel, but Britain retained all of the off-shore of the West Coast of Vancouver Island (including a small portion of the southern tip of Vancouver Island south of the 49th parallel).

After threats and squabbles over rich timber lands, the boundary between Maine and Nova Scotia was clarified by the Webster–Ashburton Treaty of 1842, negotiated by Daniel Webster and Lord Ashburton.

The Canadas were united into the Province of Canada in 1841.

On 1 July 1867, the Dominion of Canada was created by the British North America Act, 1867. The confederation process brought together the provinces of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. The former Province of Canada was split back into its two parts, with Canada East (Lower Canada) being renamed Quebec, and Canada West (Upper Canada) renamed Ontario.

Following confederation in 1867, the British Army withdrew from Canada in 1871, handing military defence over to the Canadian Militia. With the consequent abolition of the British Army&#x27;s Nova Scotia Command, and the office of its Commander-in-Chief for British North America, the still-growing Bermuda Garrison was elevated to a separate &quot;Bermuda Command&quot;.]

===Newfoundland, Rupert&#x27;s Land, and other territories of British North America===

The Colony of Newfoundland, like Bermuda, was not included in the confederation that unified the other British North American colonies to form the Dominion of Canada in 1867.

In 1870, Rupert&#x27;s Land, which consisted of territories of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, was annexed to Canada as the North-West Territories (NWT) and the new province of Manitoba. British Columbia, the British colony on the west coast north of the 49th parallel, including all of Vancouver Island, joined as Canada&#x27;s sixth province in 1871, and Prince Edward Island joined as the seventh in 1873. The boundary of British Columbia with Washington Territory was settled by arbitration in 1872, and with Alaska by arbitration in 1903.

The Arctic Archipelago was ceded by Britain to Canada in 1880 and added to the North-West Territories. Later on, large sections of the NWT were split off as new territories (the Yukon Territory in 1898 and Nunavut in 1999), or provinces (Alberta and Saskatchewan, both in 1905), or were added to existing provinces (Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec, in stages ending in 1912).

In 1907, Newfoundland became the Dominion of Newfoundland, leaving Bermuda as the sole remaining colony in British North America. British North America ceased to exist as an administrative region of the British Empire, with all remaining British colonies in the Western Hemisphere, from Bermuda to the Falkland Islands grouped in the &quot;West Indian Division&quot; of the &quot;Crown Colonies Department&quot; of the Colonial Office.

In 1934, Newfoundland returned to British administration under the Commission of Government. Bermuda was increasingly perceived by the British Government as in, or at least grouped for convenience with, the British West Indies. The last official administrative link to the Maritimes was through the established church. In 1879 the Synod of the Church of England in Bermuda was formed and a Diocese of Bermuda became separate from the Diocese of Newfoundland, but continued to be grouped under the &quot;Bishop of Newfoundland and Bermuda&quot; until 1919, when Newfoundland and Bermuda each received its own bishop.

In 1949, the island of Newfoundland, and its associated mainland territory of Labrador, joined Canada as the tenth province.

Canada became semi-independent beginning in 1867, and fully sovereign on foreign affairs beginning with the Statute of Westminster 1931. Canada gained the right to establish and accept foreign embassies, with the first one being in Washington, D.C.

The last vestiges of Canada&#x27;s constitutional dependency upon Britain were eliminated when Canadians from various provinces agreed on an internal procedure for amending the Canadian Constitution. This agreement was implemented when the British Parliament passed the Canada Act 1982 at the request of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, with the support of nine of the ten provinces of Canada.

==British North America colonies==
Following the 1776 declaration of independence of the colonies that were to form the United States (which was to be recognised by the British Government in 1783), the areas that remained under British sovereignty were administered by the Home Office, which had been formed on 27 March 1782, and which also controlled the military until this was transferred to the War Office in 1794. The Home Office referred to the remaining North American continental colonies and the archipelago of Bermuda (located off North Carolina) as &quot;British North America&quot; and their administration was increasingly linked. In 1801, administration of the colonies was moved from the Home Office to the War Office (which became the &quot;War and Colonial Office&quot;), with the Secretary of State for War thus becoming the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies until 1854, when the &quot;War and Colonial Office&quot; was split into the War Office (under the &quot;Secretary of State for War&quot;) and the Colonial Office (under the Secretary of State for the Colonies).

Prior to the signing of the 1846 Oregon Treaty, the North American continental colonies were as follows:

*Province of Canada (previously Upper Canada and Lower Canada)
*Newfoundland
*Nova Scotia
*New Brunswick
*Prince Edward Island
*Rupert&#x27;s Land
*British Arctic Territories
*Columbia District/Oregon Country (shared with the United States)

The North Atlantic oceanic archipelago of Bermuda, not strictly part of the Americas at all, was also included as its nearest neighbour (after the United States) is Nova Scotia.

==Administration==
Besides the local colonial governments in each colony, British North America was administered directly via London.

Other than the territory administered by the Honourable East India Company and protectorates, the British Empire, including British North America (but not including the territory administered by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company), was administered until 1783 by the Board of Trade, from 1783 through 1801 by the Home Office and by the Home Secretary, then from 1801 to 1854 by the War Office (which became the &quot;War and Colonial Office&quot;) and Secretary of State for War and Colonies (as the Secretary of State for War was renamed). From 1824, the British Empire was divided by the War and Colonial Office into four administrative departments, including &quot;NORTH AMERICA&quot;, the &quot;WEST INDIES&quot;, &quot;MEDITERRANEAN AND AFRICA&quot;, and &quot;EASTERN COLONIES&quot;, of which North America included:

North America
* Upper Canada, Lower Canada
* New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island
* Bermuda, Newfoundland

Until 1846, the postal system had a deputy based in British North America, with administration from London.

The Colonial Office and War Office, and the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Secretary of State for War, were separated in 1854. The War Office, from then, until the 1867 confederation of the &quot;Dominion of Canada&quot;, split the military administration of the British colonial and foreign stations into nine districts: &quot;North America And North Atlantic&quot;; &quot;West Indies&quot;; &quot;Mediterranean&quot;; &quot;West Coast Of Africa And South Atlantic&quot;; &quot;South Africa&quot;; &quot;Egypt And The Sudan&quot;; &quot;INDIAN OCEAN&quot;; &quot;Australia&quot;; and &quot;China&quot;. North America And North Atlantic included the following &quot;stations&quot; (or garrisons):

North America and North Atlantic
* New Westminster (British Columbia)
* Newfoundland
* Quebec
* Halifax
* Kingston, Canada West
* Bermuda

The Colonial Office, by 1862, oversaw eight Colonies in British North America, including:

North American Colonies, 1862
* Canada
* Nova Scotia
* New Brunswick
* Prince Edward Island
* Newfoundland
* Bermuda
* Vancouver Island
* British Columbia

By 1867, administration of the South Atlantic Ocean archipelago of the Falkland Islands, which had been colonised in 1833, had been added to the remit of the North American Department of the Colonial Office.

* New Brunswick
* Prince Edward Island
* Newfoundland
* Bermuda
* Vancouver Island
* British Columbia
* Falkland Islands

Following the 1867 confederation of most of the British North American colonies to form the Dominion of Canada, Bermuda and Newfoundland remained as the only British colonies in North America (although the Falkland Islands also continued to be administered by the North American Department of the Colonial Office). Although the British Government was no longer responsible for Canada, its relationship with Canada and subsequent dominions would continue to be overseen by the Secretary of State for the Colonies (who headed the Colonial Office) until the creation of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (a position initially held in common with the Secretary of State for the Colonies) in 1925. The reduction of the territory administered by the British Government would result in re-organisation of the Colonial Office. In 1901, the departments of the Colonial Office included: &quot;North American and Australasian&quot;; &quot;West Indian&quot;; &quot;Eastern&quot;; &quot;South African&quot;; and &quot;West African&quot; (two departments).

Of these, the &quot;North American and Australasian Department&quot; included:

* Canada
* Newfoundland
* Bermuda
* Bahamas
* British Honduras
* New South Wales
* Victoria
* South Australia
* Queensland
* Western Australia
* Tasmania, New Zealand
* Fiji
* British New Guinea
* Western Pacific
* Cyprus
* Gibraltar
* Falkland Islands.

In 1907, the Colony of Newfoundland became the Dominion of Newfoundland, leaving the Imperial fortress of Bermuda as the sole remaining British North American colony.

Bermuda, with a land mass totalling less than 21 square miles and a population of 17,535, could hardly constitute an Imperial administrative region on its own. By 1908, the Colonial Office included two departments (one overseeing dominion and protectorate business, the other colonial): Dominions Department (Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Cape of Good Hope, Natal, Newfoundland, Transvaal, Orange River Colony, Australian States, Fiji, Western Pacific, Basutoland, Bechuanaland Protectorate, Swaziland, Rhodesia); Crown Colonies Department. The Crown Colonies Department was made up of four territorial divisions: Eastern Division; West Indian Division; East African and Mediterranean Division; and the West African Division.

Of these, the &quot;West Indian Division&quot; now included all of the remaining British colonies in the Western Hemisphere, from Bermuda to the Falkland Islands:

Jamaica, Turks Islands, British Honduras, British Guiana, Bahamas, Bermuda, Trinidad, Barbados, Windward Islands, Leeward Islands, Falkland Islands, and St. Helena.

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Reigen&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Nijō Mitsuhira, 1663–1664
* &quot;Sessho&quot;, Takatsukasa Fusasuke, 1664–1668
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Takatsukasa Fusasuke, 1668–1682
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Ichijō Kaneteru, 1682–1687
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

<doc id="219391" wikidata="Q314817" url="?curid=219391" title="Emperor Nakamikado">
<text>, posthumously honored as , was the 114th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. He was enthroned as Emperor in 1709, a reign that would last until 1735 with his abdication.

As Emperor, Nakamikado had an increasingly warmed relationship with the shogunate in part due to his father&#x27;s efforts. Relations warmed up to the point of family marriage talks, but these fell through due to the sudden death of the potential Shōgun groom. Events that surrounded the Emperor included at least 2 major earthquakes, the largest Ryukyuan diplomatic mission of the Edo period, the Kyōhō Reforms, and the Kyōhō famine. It is unclear what role if any the Emperor had in these concurrent events as the role of &quot;Emperor&quot; was a figurehead at the time. Nakamikado&#x27;s family included at least 14 children mothered by his wife, and 5 concubines. Nakamikado abdicated the throne in 1735 in favor of his first son, and died two years later.

==Events of Nakamikado&#x27;s life==
===Early life===
Before Nakamikado&#x27;s ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was . Yasuhito was born on January 14, 1702, and was the fifth son of Emperor Higashiyama, while his birth mother was a lady-in-waiting named Kushige Yoshiko. Due to tradition he was brought up as if he were the son of the Empress consort (Arisugawa no Yukiko). Yasuhito&#x27;s Imperial family lived with him in the Dairi of the Heian Palace. The early years of Yasuhito&#x27;s life were marked with disasters and incidents that included two major earthquakes, and a revenge plot involving leaderless samurai to avenge their fallen master. The two major earthquakes that took place were in 1703, and then again in 1707. The first of these is the 1703 Genroku earthquake, which caused parts of the shōgun&#x27;s castle to collapse in Edo. The city was consumed by a large fire that swept through the city on the following day. In response, the era&#x27;s name was changed to Hōei (meaning &quot;Prosperous Eternity&quot;) the following year in hopes of better fortune. The second earthquake (1707 Hōei earthquake), dealt serious damage and suffering to the city of Osaka. Mt. Fuji also erupted that same year causing ash to fall on Izu, Kai, Sagami, and Musashi. In 1708, Yasuhito became Crown Prince and was given the pre-accession title of &quot;Masu-no-miya&quot; (長宮). On a particular note, Shōgun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi appointed a commission to repair and restore Imperial mausoleums shortly before his death on February 19, 1709.

===Reign===

Prince Yoshihito acceded to the throne on July 27, 1709, as Emperor when his father abdicated in his favor. While he held the political title of &quot;Emperor&quot;, it was in name only as the shoguns of the Tokugawa family controlled Japan. Due to his young age at the time, Imperial powers were exercised in his name by his now retired father Emperor Higashiyama. On January 16, 1710, Higashiyama died, and the imperial powers were now exercised in Nakamikado&#x27;s name by his also retired grandfather Emperor Reigen. Events that took place during this transitional time included a Ryukyuan diplomatic mission, which lasted from July 7, 1710, to March 22, 1711. This particular mission was led by King Shō Eki of the Ryūkyū Kingdom, and was received by the shogunate. While this mission did not concern the young prince, this was the largest delegation in the Edo period at 168 people involved.

Nakamikado was formally enthroned as Emperor in 1711, and the era&#x27;s name was changed from Hōei to Shōtoku. His reign would corresponded to the period from the sixth to the eighth &quot;shōgun&quot;. During this period, relations with the Tokugawa shogunate were fairly good in part due to former Emperor Higashiyama&#x27;s warmed relationship with predecessors. Relations warmed to the point of marriage talks between Imperial Princess Yaso-no-miya Yoshiko (八十宮吉子内親王), daughter of Retired Emperor Reigen and the seventh shōgun, Tokugawa Ietsugu. These plans later became moot with the sudden death of Ietsugu at the age of six in Edo. On April 20, 1715, celebrations were held throughout the empire regarding the 100th anniversary of the death of the founding shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu (posthumously known as Gongen-sama). After Ietsugu&#x27;s death in 1716, Tokugawa Yoshimune became the next shogun. He implemented the &quot;Kyōhō&quot; reforms the following year which eventually resulted in partial success. While the Emperor had no say in these reforms, Yoshimune had the Imperial mausolea repaired in 1718.

The next several years of Nakamikado&#x27;s reign saw the implementation of the shogun&#x27;s reforms, by 1730 the shogunate officially recognized the Dojima Rice Market in Osaka; and government supervisors (&quot;nengyoji&quot;) are appointed to monitor the market and to collect taxes. The transactions relating to rice exchanges developed into securities exchanges, used primarily for transactions in public securities. This development of improved agriculture production caused the price of rice to fall in mid-&quot;Kyohō&quot;. Intervening factors like famine, floods and other disasters though exacerbated some of the conditions which the shōgun intended to ameliorate. On August 3, 1730, a great fire broke out in Muromachi, 3,790 houses were burnt, and over 30,000 looms in Nishi-jin were destroyed. The Kyōhō famine started in 1732 and lasted into 1733, due to swarms of locust that devastated crops in agricultural communities around the inland sea.

===Daijō Tennō===

Emperor Nakamikado abdicated on April 13, 1735, in favor of his son Teruhito, who became Emperor Sakuramachi. Nakamikado took on the title of Daijō Tennō (Retired Emperor), and the era&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Genbun&quot; (meaning &quot;Original civility&quot;) to mark the occasion. Even though he was retired, Nakamikado continued to exercise Imperial powers in the same way his predecessors had done. While the Emperor had no say, a major milestone occurred in Japanese monetary history when the shogunate published an edict in 1736 regarding coinage. This edict declared that henceforth, authorized coinage in the empire would be those copper coins which were marked on the obverse with the character 文 (&quot;Genbun&quot;, also pronounced &quot;bun&quot; in Japanese). The practice of placing the name of the era on coinage continues to present day with . Nakamikado died in 1737 due to unknown causes, his &quot;kami&quot; is enshrined in an Imperial mausoleum (&quot;misasagi&quot;), &quot;Tsuki no wa no misasagi,&quot; at Sennyū-ji in Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto. Also enshrined in this location are his immediate Imperial predecessors since Emperor Go-Mizunoo – Meishō, Go-Kōmyō, Go-Sai, Reigen, and Higashiyama. Nakamikado&#x27;s immediate Imperial successors, including Sakuramachi, Momozono, Go-Sakuramachi and Go-Momozono, are enshrined here as well.

==Eras and Kugyō==
The years of Nakamikado&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;. While is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted. In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career.

The following eras occurred during Nakamikado&#x27;s reign:

* &quot;Hōei&quot; (1704–1711)
* &quot;Shōtoku&quot; (1711–1716)
* &quot;Kyōhō&quot; (1716–1736)

During Nakamikado&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:

* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Konoe Iehiro
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Genealogy== 
Nakamikado&#x27;s family included at least 14 children who were born from his wife and 5 concubines:

<text>Loyalism, in the United Kingdom, its overseas territories and its former colonies, refers to the allegiance to the British crown or the United Kingdom. In North America, the most common usage of the term refers to loyalty to the British Crown, notably with the loyalists opponents of the American Revolution, and United Empire Loyalists who moved to other colonies in British North America after the revolution.

== Historical loyalism ==
===18th century===
====North America====

In North America, the term &quot;loyalist&quot; characterised colonists who rejected the American Revolution in favour of remaining loyal to the king. American loyalists included royal officials, Anglican clergymen, wealthy merchants with ties to London, demobilised British soldiers, and recent arrivals (especially from Scotland), as well as many ordinary colonists who were conservative by nature and/or felt that the protection of Britain was needed. Colonists with loyalist views accounted for an estimated 15 per cent to 20 per cent of the white colonial population of the day, compared with those described as &quot;Patriots&quot;, who accounted for about 40–50 per cent of the population and the rest neutrals. This high level of political polarisation leads historians to argue that the American Revolution was as much a civil war as it was a war of independence from the British Crown.

British military strategy during the American Revolution relied on mobilising loyalist soldiers throughout the Thirteen Colonies. Throughout the war, the British military formed over 100 loyalist line regiments whose strength totaled 19,000 of which 9,700 served most at one time. Including militia and marine forces more than 50,000 served. The Patriots used tactics such as property confiscation to suppress loyalism and drive active loyalists away.

After the war, approximately 80–90 per cent of the Loyalists stayed in the new United States, and adapted to the new conditions and changes of a republic.

=====Loyalist migrants=====
Of the 62,000 who left by 1784, almost 50,000 sought refuge elsewhere in the British North American colonies of Quebec (partitioned into the Canadas in 1791), New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and St. John&#x27;s Island; whereas the remaining loyalist migrants went to Jamaica, the Bahamas and Britain, often with financial help from the Crown. They were joined by 30,000 or more &quot;Late Loyalists&quot; who settled in Ontario in the early 1790s at the invitation of the British administration and given land and low taxes in exchange for swearing allegiance to the King, for a total of 70,000+ new settlers. There were in fact four waves of emigration: in the years 1774 through 1776 when for example 1300 Tories were evacuated with the British fleet that left Boston for Halifax; the large wave of 50,000 in the years 1783; some few thousands who had stayed in the new Republic but left disenchanted with the results of the revolution for Upper Canada between 1784 and 1790; and the large number &#x27;Late Loyalists,&#x27; 30,000, who came in the early 1790s for land, many of them neutrals during the War, to Upper Canada; they soon outnumbered the original truly committed anti-Republicans, 10,000, who had earlier arrived: some Loyalists about 10 per cent maybe from New Brunswick returned to the States as did an unknown number from Nova Scotia. This migration also included indigenous loyalists such as Mohawk leader Joseph Brant, the &quot;Black Loyalists&quot; – former slaves who had joined the British cause in exchange for their freedom, and Anabaptist loyalists (Mennonites).

These Loyalists were the founders of modern English-speaking Canada, and many of their descendants of these King&#x27;s Loyal Americans still identify themselves with the nominal hereditary title &quot;UEL&quot; (United Empire Loyalist) today. To one degree or another, from ideological reasons or less so mixed with prospects of a better life, &quot;All the Loyalists had taken a stand for the Crown and the British Empire&quot;...whether &quot;from a rigorous toryism to some vague sense that royal government was hardly so evil as its enemies claimed. In Canada this diversity was preserved. The Loyalist communities were rarely unanimous – or placid – in their politics&quot;.

==== Ireland ====
The term &quot;loyalist&quot; was first used in Irish politics in the 1790s to refer to Protestant Irishmen (often of English or Scottish ancestry) who opposed Catholic Emancipation and Irish independence from the British Empire. Prominent Irish loyalists included John Foster, John Fitzgibbon and John Beresford. In the subsequent Irish Rebellion of 1798, the term &quot;ultra loyalist&quot; was used to describe those who were opposed to the United Irishmen, who were in support of an independent Irish Republic. In 1795, Ulster loyalists founded the Orange Order and organised the Yeoman Militia, which helped to put down the rebellion. Some loyalists, such as Richard Musgrave, considered the rebellion a Catholic plot to drive Protestant colonists out of Ireland.

===19th century===
==== Australia ====
The Sydney and Parramatta Loyalist Associations, with approximately 50 members each, were formed in 1804 to counter radical societies in those counties, and subsequently helped to put down the Castle Hill convict rebellion later that year.

==== England and Wales ====

During the early 19th century, nearly every English and Welsh county formed a Loyalist Association of Workers in an effort to counter a perceived threat from radical societies. The first such association was founded in Westminster on 20 November 1792.

== Modern loyalism ==
=== Northern Ireland ===

Generally, the term &quot;loyalist&quot; in Northern Ireland is typified by a militant opposition to Irish republicanism, and also often to Roman Catholicism. It stresses Ulster Protestant identity and community with its own folk heroes and events, such as the actions of the 36th (Ulster) Division during World War I and the activities of the Orange Order. An Ulster loyalist is most commonly a unionist who strongly favours the political union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, although some may also support an independent Northern Ireland. In recent times, the term has been used to refer to several loyalist paramilitary groups, such as the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), Red Hand Commando (RHC) and the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF).

Although Irish loyalist paramilitaries have claimed to speak on behalf of their communities and unionists in general, their electoral support is minimal and exclusively based in the urban working class. The Progressive Unionist Party, a pro-Belfast Agreement loyalist party, won seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly in 1998, 2003 and 2007, but lost them in 2011.

=== Republic of Ireland ===
Loyalism in the post-partition Republic of Ireland has declined since independence. Large numbers of southern Irish loyalists and non-loyalists volunteered for service in the British Armed Forces in World War I and World War II, many of them losing their lives or settling in the United Kingdom after the wars. Partition saw mass movements of southern loyalists to Northern Ireland or to Great Britain, although small loyalist or neo-unionist groups are still active.

=== Scotland ===
The Scottish loyalist movement originated during the Industrial Revolution when a significant number of Ulster Protestants migrated to Scotland from Ireland. In Scotland, a loyalist is someone on the fringes of Scottish unionism who is often strongly supportive of loyalism and unionism, although mainly concentrating on the Irish union issue rather than on Scottish politics. Scottish loyalism is typified by militant opposition to Scottish republicanism, Scottish independence.

Coming from a large section of Scottish society Scottish loyalism has become more visible through prominent demonstrations of the beliefs of its members since the establishment of a Scottish Parliament. Scottish loyalism is visible through participation at Orange parades with supporters from Rangers, Heart of Midlothian F.C. and Airdrie United.
Loyalists in Scotland mostly live in small working-class enclaves in the major urban centres or industrial villages, notably Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Edinburgh, Renfrewshire, Fife, West Lothian and Ayrshire. There are relatively few loyalists in areas such as Aberdeen, the Scottish Borders and the Scottish Highlands.

<doc id="219396" wikidata="Q3150005" url="?curid=219396" title="Legal instrument">
<text>Legal instrument is a legal term of art that is used for any formally executed written document that can be formally attributed to its author, records and formally expresses a legally enforceable act, process, or contractual duty, obligation, or right, and therefore evidences that act, process, or agreement. Examples include a , deed, bond, contract, will, legislative act, notarial act, court writ or process, or any law passed by a competent legislative body in domestic or international law. Many legal instruments were written &quot;under seal&quot; by affixing a wax or paper seal to the document in evidence of its legal execution and authenticity (which often removed the need for consideration in contract law). However, today many jurisdictions have done away with the requirement of documents being under seal in order to give them legal effect.

==Electronic legal documents==
With the onset of the Internet and electronic equipment such as the personal computers and cell-phones, legal instruments or formal legal documents have undergone a progressive change of dematerialisation. In this electronic age, document authentication can now be verified digitally using various software. All documents needing authentication can be processed as digital documents with all the necessary information such as date and time stamp imbedded. To prevent tampering or unauthorized changes to the original document, encryption is used. In modern times, authentication is no longer limited to the type of paper used, the specialized seal, stamps, etc., as document authentication software helps secure the original context. The use of electronic legal documents is most prominent in the United States&#x27; courts. Most American courts prefer the filing of electronic legal documents over paper. However, there is not yet a public law to unify the different standards of document authentication. Therefore, one must know the court&#x27;s requirement before filing court papers.

To address part of this concern, the United States Congress enacted the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act in 2000 (P.L. 106-229 of 2000, 15 USCS sec. 7001) specifying that no court could thereafter fail to recognize a contract simply because it was digitally signed. The law is very permissive, making essentially any electronic character in a contract sufficient. It is also quite restrictive in that it does not force the recognition of some document types in electronic form, no matter what the electronic character might be. No restriction is made to signatures which are adequately cryptographically tied to both the document text (see message digest) and to a particular key whose use should be restricted to certain persons (e.g., the alleged sender). There is thus a gap between what the cryptographic engineering can provide and what the law assumes is both possible and meaningful.

Several states had already enacted laws on the subject of electronic legal documents and signatures before the U.S. Congress had acted, including Utah, Washington, and California to name only a few of the earliest. They vary considerably in intent, coverage, cryptographic understanding, and effect.

Several other nations and international bodies have also enacted statutes and regulations regarding the validity and binding nature of digital signatures.

To date, the variety (and inadequacy) of the definitions used for digital signatures (or electronic signatures) have produced a legal and contractual minefield for those who may be considering relying on the legality and enforceability of digitally signed contracts in any of many jurisdictions. Adequate legislation adequately informed by cryptographic engineering technology remains an elusive goal. That it has been fully, or adequately, achieved (in any jurisdiction) is a claim which must be taken with considerable caution.

It is the sole member of the genus Hypocolius and it is placed in a family of its own, the Hypocoliidae. This slender and long tailed bird is found in the dry semi-desert region of northern Africa, Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and western India. They fly in flocks and forage mainly on fruits, migrating south in winter. During migration they are often found feeding on the fruits of &quot;Salvadora persica&quot;.

==Description==
The grey hypocolius is a slim bird with a long tail, slight crest and thick, short hook-tipped bill. Its shape and soft, satiny plumage resembles that of the waxwing. Birds are mainly a uniform grey or brownish-grey colour, with males having a black triangular mask around the eyes. They have white-tipped black primary wing feathers and a black terminal band on the tail. Adults are about in length.

The head feathers are raised when the bird is excited. They fly in a straight non-undulating style and when hopping in shrubbery, can appear like a babbler. The tarsus is short and sturdy with coarse scales. There are rictal bristles visible at the base of the bill and the nostrils are exposed, small and oval.

==Taxonomy==
The relationships of the species were formerly unclear. Earlier authors had suggested that they were related to the bulbuls or shrikes. They appear to be related to the waxwings, and at least one study based on molecular sequences suggests that it belongs to the same group. A 2019 study found them to be in a clade containing the palmchat (Dulidae), waxwings (Bombycillidae), silky-flycatchers (Ptiliogonatidae), hylocitrea (Hylocitreidae), and the extinct Hawaiian honeyeaters (Mohoidae), with Hypocoliidae being a sister group to the Mohoidae (with both diverging about 15-20 mya during the early-mid Miocene), and the clade containing Mohoidae and Hypocoliidae being sister to Hylocitreidae, which diverged slightly earlier in the Miocene.

==Distribution and habitat==
The grey hypocolius ranges through the Middle East, breeding in the Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkmenistan area, and wintering mostly near the Red Sea and Persian Gulf coasts of Arabia, including Bahrain. It is a vagrant to Turkey, Israel, Egypt and Oman. They are regular winter visitors to the Kutch and Jamnagar region of western India and vagrants have been noted as far south as Kihim near Bombay. It is found in woodland and scrub in arid and semiarid regions, especially river valleys near deserts, as well as in irrigated and cultivated areas with trees, sea costal area, palm groves and gardens.

==Behaviour==

The grey hypocolius is a shy and unobtrusive, even cryptic, bird which will fly to thick cover when disturbed, where it will remain motionless until the perceived danger has passed. Its flight is strong and direct (without undulations). It will form flocks, especially in winter, and roost communally.

===Breeding===

The breeding season is June or July in Arabia. The nest is cup shaped and deep lined with hair and fluff. The nest is often placed on the leaves of a date palm at a height of about 3 to 5 feet. Both the male and female take part in nest building. The clutch is four eggs. The eggs are leaden white with blotches. The incubation period is about 14–15 days.

===Feeding===
Grey hypocoliuses forage quietly and methodically in foliage, through clusters of trees, palm groves and orchards, rarely coming to the ground. Though they may eat some insects, their main diet consists of fruits and berries, including toothbrush tree fruits, mulberries, figs and dates. In captivity they have been known to readily take bread.

===Calls===
The most common vocalization is a series of squealing descending notes or &quot;kleeeu&quot; whistles. Other calls include scolding chirps.

==Conservation==
Because the species has a large range, and because it does not meet the population size and decline criteria of the IUCN Red List, the conservation status is evaluated as being of &quot;least concern&quot;. Because of its monotypic family status it is much sought after by birdwatchers.

<text>The Syriac Catholic Church is an Eastern Catholic Christian jurisdiction originating in the Levant that uses the West Syriac Rite liturgy and has many practices and rites in common with the Syriac Orthodox Church. Being one of the twenty-three Eastern Catholic Churches, the Syriac Catholic Church is a self-governed &quot;sui iuris&quot; particular church, while it is in full communion with the Holy See and with the entirety of the Catholic Church.

The Syriac Catholic Church traces its history and traditions to the early centuries of Christianity. Following the Chalcedonian Schism, the Church of Antioch became part of Oriental Orthodoxy and was known as the Syriac Orthodox Church, while a new Antiochian patriarchate was established to fill its place by those churches that accepted the Council of Chalcedon. The Syriac Catholic Church came into full communion with the Holy See and the modern Syriac Orthodox Church is the result of those that did not want to join the Catholic Church. Therefore, the Syriac Catholic Church is considered by some to be a continuation of the original Church of Antioch.

The church is headed by Mor Ignatius Joseph III Younan, who has been the patriarch since 2009. Its patriarch of Antioch has the title of Patriarch of Antioch and all the East of the Syriacs and resides in Beirut, Lebanon.

Jesuit and Capuchin missionaries began to work among the Syriac Orthodox in Aleppo in 1626. So many of them were received into communion with Rome that, in 1662, when the patriarchate had fallen vacant, the Catholic party was able to elect one of its own, Andrew Akijan, as patriarch of the Syriac Church. This provoked a split in the community, and after Akijan&#x27;s death in 1677, two opposing patriarchs were elected, representing the two parties (one pro-Catholic, the other anti-Catholic). Though this line of Catholic patriarchs ended in 1702, in 1782 the Syriac Orthodox Holy Synod elected Metropolitan Michael Jarweh of Aleppo as patriarch who, shortly after he was enthroned, declared himself Catholic and in unity with the pope of Rome. Since Jarweh, there has been an unbroken succession of Syriac Catholic patriarchs.

==Name==
The Syriac Catholic Church () is sometimes also called the Syrian Catholic Church. Furthermore, it is sometimes referred by its patriarchate, the Syriac Catholic Patriarchate of Antioch. See also: Syriac Catholic Patriarchs of Antioch.

== History ==

===Pre-Crusades period===
The Syriac Catholic Church claims its origin through Saint Peter prior to his departure to Rome, and extends its roots back to the origins of Christianity in the Orient; in the Acts of the Apostles we are told that it is in Antioch where the followers of Jesus for the first time were called &quot;Christians&quot; (Acts 11:26).

In the time of the first ecumenical councils, the Patriarch of Antioch held the ecclesiastical authority over the Diocese of the Orient, which was to be extended from the Mediterranean Sea to the Persian Gulf. Its scholarly mission in both languages, Greek and Syriac, was to provide the world and the Universal Church with eminent saints, scholars, hermits, martyrs and pastors. Among these great people are Saint Ephrem (373), Doctor of the Church, and Saint Jacob of Sarug (521).

=== During the Crusades ===
During the Crusades there were many examples of warm relations between Catholic and Syriac Orthodox bishops. Some of these bishops favored union with Rome, but there was no push to unify until a decree of union between the Syriac Orthodox and Rome was signed at the Council of Florence September 30, 1444 – but the effects of this decree were rapidly annulled by opponents of it in the Syriac Church&#x27;s hierarchy.

===Split with the Syriac Orthodox Church===
A Jesuit and Capuchin missionaries evangelizing in Aleppo caused some local Syriac Orthodox faithful to form a pro-catholic movement within the Syriac Orthodox Church. In 1667, Andrew Akijan, a supporter of union with the Catholic Church, was elected as patriarch of the Syriac Orthodox Church. This provoked a split in the community, and after Akijan&#x27;s death in 1677, two opposing patriarchs were elected, with the pro-Catholic one being the uncle of Andrew Akijan. However, when the Catholic patriarch died in 1702, the Ottoman government supported the Syriac Orthodoxy&#x27;s agitation against the Syriac Catholics, and throughout the 18th century the Syriac Catholics underwent suffering and much persecution. Due to this, there were long periods when no Syriac Catholic bishops were functioning, so a patriarch could not be elected, and the community was forced to go entirely underground. However, in 1782, the Syriac Orthodox Holy Synod elected Metropolitan Michael Jarweh of Aleppo as patriarch. Shortly after he was enthroned, he declared himself Catholic and in unity with the pope of Rome. After this declaration, Jarweh took refuge in Lebanon and built the still-extant monastery of Our Lady at Sharfeh, and by that act became the patriarch of the Syriac Catholic Church. Since Jarweh, there has been an unbroken succession of Syriac Catholic patriarchs, which is known as the &quot;Ignatius&quot; Line.

===After the split up until modern times===
In 1829 the Ottoman government granted legal recognition to the Armenian Catholic Church, and in 1845 the Syriac Catholic Church was also granted its own civil emancipation. Meanwhile, the residence of the patriarch was shifted to Aleppo in 1831. However, after the Massacre of Aleppo in 1850, the patriarchal see was shifted to Mardin in 1854.

After becoming officially recognized by the Ottoman government in 1845, the Syriac Catholic Church expanded rapidly. However, the expansion was ended by the persecutions and massacres that took place during the Assyrian genocide of World War I. After that, the Syriac Catholic patriarchal see was moved to Beirut away from Mardin, to which many Ottoman Christians had fled the genocide. In addition to its see in Beirut, the patriarchal seminary and printing house are located at Sharfeh Monastery in Sharfeh, Lebanon.

== Organization ==

===Leadership===

, the patriarch of Antioch (an ancient major see, where several Catholic and Orthodox patriarchates nominally reside) was Moran Mor Ignatius Joseph III Younan, resident in Beirut, Lebanon. The Syriac Catholic patriarch always takes the name &quot;Ignatius&quot; in addition to another name.

In modern history the leaders of the Syriac Catholic Church have been: Patriarch Michael III Jarweh, Archbishop Clemens Daoud, Patriarch Ephrem Rahmani, Vicomte de Tarrazi, Monsignor Ishac Armaleh, Ignatius Gabriel I Tappouni, Chorbishop Gabriel Khoury-Sarkis, Ignatius Antony II Hayyek, Ignatius Moses I Daoud, Ignatius Peter VIII Abdalahad, and Ignatius Joseph III Yonan.
Eminent Syriac saints, scholars, hermits, martyrs and pastors since 1100 also include Dionysius Bar Salibi (1171), Gregorius X Bar Hebraeus (1286) and more recently Bishop Mor Flavianus Michael Malke.

The Syriac Church leadership has produced a variety of scholarly writings in a variety of topics. For example, Patriarch Ephrem Rahmani was widely praised for his work in Syriac and is responsible for Pope Benedict XV recognising Saint Ephrem as a Doctor of the Catholic Church. Likewise Patriarch Ignatius Behnam II Beni is known for imploring Eastern theology to defend the primacy of Rome.

The patriarch of Antioch and all the East of the Syriacs presides upon the Patriarchal Eparchy of Beirut and leads spiritually all the Syriac Catholic community around the world.

The community includes two archdioceses in Iraq, four in Syria, one in Egypt and Sudan, a patriarchal vicariate in Palestine, a patriarchal vicariate in Turkey and the Eparchy of Our Lady of Deliverance in the United States and Canada.

== Liturgy ==
The West Syriac Rite is rooted in the old tradition of both the churches of Jerusalem and Antioch and has ties with the ancient Jewish Berakah.

The Syriac Catholic Church follows a similar tradition to other Eastern Catholic Churches who use the West Syriac Rite, such as the Maronites and Syro-Malankara Christians. This rite is clearly distinct from the Greek Byzantine rite of Antioch of the Melkite Catholics and their Orthodox counterparts. Syriac Catholic priests were traditionally bound to celibacy by the Syriac Catholic local Synod of Sharfeh in 1888, but there are now a number of married priests.

The liturgy of the Syriac Catholic Church is very similar to that of the Syriac Orthodox Church.

=== Liturgical paraphernalia ===

==== Fans ====

The Syriac Catholic Church uses fans with bells on them and engraved with seraphim during the Qurbono. Usually someone in the minor orders would shake these fans behind a bishop to symbolise the seraphim. They are also used during the consecration where two men would shake them over the altar during moments in the epliclesis and words of institution when the priest says &quot;he took and broke&quot; and &quot;this is my body/blood&quot;.

==== Thurible ====
The thurible of the Syriac Catholic Church consists of nine bells, representing the nine choirs of angels.

=== Liturgy of the Hours ===
The Liturgy of the Hours is exactly the same as in the Syriac Orthodox. There are two versions of this: the Phenqitho and the Shhimo. The former is the more complicated seven-volume version. While the latter is the simple version.
=== Liturgical ranking ===
Likewise the ranking of clerics in the Syriac Catholic Church is extremely similar to that of the Syriac Orthodox Church. The most notable differences are:
* Not all celibate priests take on monastic vows. In the Syriac Orthodox Church all celibate priests are monks.
* There is a solid distinction between the major orders and minor orders in the Syriac Catholic Church:
* A man is tonsured as soon as he receives his first minor order of Mzamrono (Cantor).

====Major orders====
* Bishop
* Kahno (Priest)
* Mshamshono (Deacon)

====Minor orders====
* Afudyaqno (Sub-deacon)
* Quroyo (Lector)
* Mzamrono (Cantor)

=== Languages ===
The liturgical language of the Syriac Catholic Church, Syriac, is a dialect of Aramaic. The Qurbono Qadisho (literally: Holy Mass or Holy Offering/Sacrifice) of the Syriac Church uses a variety of Anaphoras, with the Anaphora of the 12 Apostles being the one mostly in use with the Liturgy of St James the Just.

Their ancient semitic language is known as Aramaic (or &quot;Syriac&quot; after the time of Christ since the majority of people who spoke this language belonged to the province of &quot;Syria&quot;). It is the language spoken by Jesus, Mary and the Apostles. Many of the ancient hymns of the church are still maintained in this native tongue although several have been translated into Arabic, English, French and other languages.

Syriac is still spoken in some few communities in eastern Syria and northern Iraq, but for most Arabic is the vernacular language.

== Martyrs ==
Throughout the history of the Syriac Church there have been many martyrs. A recent example is Flavianus Michael Malke during the 1915 Assyrian genocide.

=== Syriac Catholics in Iraq ===

On 31 October 2010, 58 Iraqi Syriac Catholics were killed by Muslim extremists while attending Sunday Divine Liturgy; 78 others were wounded. The attack by Iraqi ISIS on the congregation of Our Lady of Deliverance Syriac Catholic Church was the bloodiest single attack on an Iraqi Christian church in recent history.

Two priests, Fathers Saad Abdallah Tha&#x27;ir and Waseem Tabeeh, were killed. Another, Father Qatin, was seriously wounded but recovered.

<doc id="219407" wikidata="Q712783" url="?curid=219407" title="Patriarch Peter VII of Alexandria">
<text>Peter VII (September 3, 1949 – September 11, 2004) was the Greek Orthodox Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria and all Africa from 1997 to 2004. During his reign, Petros VII was credited with reviving the Greek Orthodox churches in Africa by increasing the churches&#x27; attendance of about 250,000 people.

==Early life==
Petros was born Petros Papapetrou () in Sichari, Kyrenia District, Cyprus on September 3, 1949. He was the oldest son of a Greek Orthodox family and both his father and grandfather were priests.

==Education==
At the age of 12, Petros enrolled at the Machairas Monastery. Then at 17, Petros entered the Apostle Barnabas Seminary in Nicosia. 
He graduated from Barnbas Seminary in 1969 and was ordained as a deacon at the Machairas Monastery. 

A year later, Petros was summoned by Patriarch Nicholas VI to Alexandria. He served as a deacon under Nicholas VI while studying at the Averof High Schools. Later on, in 1974, Petros received a scholarship from the Greek Foreign Ministry to attend the School of Theology at Athens University.

==Career==

===Work in Africa===
Upon graduating from Athens University in 1978, Petros was ordained as a priest by Bishop Chrysostomos of Dodonis and left for Cairo, where he was given the title of Patriarchal Vicar. Later, in 1983, Petros was promoted to Bishop of Babylon. Throughout his career, Petros took on multiple posts throughout Africa, ranging from Johannesburg, Accra, Cameroon and Central East Africa. While in Africa, Petros focused on restoring monasteries, such as the Monastery of St. Sawas in Alexandria, and extending his missionary work in East Africa.

===Patriarchate of Alexandria===
Petros assumed the title of Patriarchate of Alexandria on March 9, 1997, following his election by the Holy Synod in February 1997. He had a close rapport with his predecessor, Patriarch Parthenius III of Alexandria and assumed the latter&#x27;s post after his death in 1996. Throughout his reign, Petros built relationships with other church organizations and engaged with religious churches outside the Greek Orthodox community. Petros also initiated peaceful relationships between the Muslim and Christian people in the Middle East and interacted with Arab leaders, including Yasser Arafat. Petros reigned as Patriarch of Alexandria for seven years until his death.

===Missionary work===
Petros used his position as patriarch to connect Orthodox groups throughout the world and to &quot;spread the voice of Orthodoxy throughout Africa, to people who have never heard of Christ, who are dying from hunger and sicknesses, where there are no schools&quot;. In 2002, Petros wrote to George W. Bush in an attempt to prevent the Iraq War. In his letter, Petros stated that invading Iraq would be viewed as an attack on Islam and create future problems on other religions.

==Death==
On September 11, 2004, Petros VII died in a 17-person helicopter crash alongside three other Church of Alexandria bishops. The Boeing Chinook helicopter carrying the passengers crashed into the Aegean Sea while travelling to the monasteries of Mount Athos. The government declared 3 days of national mourning. In 2007, Boeing was sued by the victims&#x27; families for negligence and product liability. The lawsuit was settled out of court.

He was awarded Order of the Yugoslav Crown and Order of Saint Sava.

<text>Convair, previously Consolidated Vultee, was an American aircraft-manufacturing company that later expanded into rockets and spacecraft. The company was formed in 1943 by the merger of Consolidated Aircraft and Vultee Aircraft. In 1953, it was purchased by General Dynamics, and operated as their Convair Division for most of its corporate history.

Convair is best known for its military aircraft; it produced aircraft such as the Convair B-36 Peacemaker and Convair B-58 Hustler strategic bombers, and the Convair F-102 Delta Dagger and Convair F-106 Delta Dart interceptors. It also manufactured the first Atlas rockets, including the rockets that were used for the crewed orbital flights of Project Mercury. The company&#x27;s subsequent Atlas-Centaur design continued this success and derivatives of the design remain in use as of 2025.

The company also entered the jet airliner business with its Convair 880 and Convair 990 designs. These were smaller than contemporary aircraft like the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, but somewhat faster than both. This combination of features failed to find a profitable niche and the company exited the airliner design business. However, the manufacturing capability built up for these projects proved very profitable and the company became a major subcontractor for airliner fuselages. The jets made their first flights on January 27, 1959 and January 24, 1961 respectively. 65 and 37 examples of the Convair 880 and Convair 990 were produced respectively.

In 1994, most of the company&#x27;s divisions were sold by General Dynamics to McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed, with the remaining components deactivated in 1996.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Consolidated produced important aircraft in the early years of World War II, especially the B-24 Liberator heavy bomber and the PBY Catalina seaplane for the U.S. armed forces and their allies. Approximately 18,500 B-24s were produced by Consolidated and a number of major contractors across a number of versions; it holds records as the world&#x27;s most-produced bomber, heavy bomber, multi-engine aircraft, and American military aircraft in history. The Catalina remained in production through May 1945, and more than 4,000 were built. 

What was soon called &quot;Convair&quot; (first unofficially, and then officially), was created in 1943 by the merger of the Consolidated Aircraft Company and the Vultee Aircraft Company. This merger produced a large airplane company, ranked fourth among United States corporations by value of wartime production contracts, higher than the giants Douglas Aircraft, Boeing, and Lockheed. Convair always had most of its research, design, and manufacturing operations in San Diego County in Southern California, though surrounding counties participated as well, mostly as contractors to Convair.

=== Jet Age, Cold War, and Space Age ===
In March 1953, all of the Convair company was bought by the General Dynamics Corporation, a conglomerate of military and high-technology companies, and it became officially the Convair Division within General Dynamics.

After the beginning of the Jet Age of military fighters and bombers, Convair was a pioneer of the delta-winged aircraft design, along with the French Dassault aircraft company, which designed and built the Mirage fighter planes.

One of Convair&#x27;s most famous products was the ten-engined Convair B-36 strategic bomber, burning four turbojets and turning six pusher propellers driven by Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major radial piston engines. The Convair B-36 was the largest landbased piston engined bomber in the world. The Atlas missile, the F-102 Delta Dagger and F-106 Delta Dart delta-winged interceptors, and the delta-winged B-58 Hustler supersonic intercontinental nuclear bomber were all Convair products. For a period of time in the 1960s, Convair manufactured its own line of jet commercial airliners, the Convair 880 and Convair 990 Coronado, but this did not turn out to be profitable. However, Convair found that it was profitable to be an aviation subcontractor and manufacture large subsections of airliners — such as fuselages — for the larger airliner companies, McDonnell Douglas, Boeing, and Lockheed. 

In the 1950s, Convair shifted money and effort to its missile and rocket projects, producing the Terrier missile ship-launched surface-to-air system for the U.S. Navy during the 1960s and 1970s. Convair&#x27;s Atlas rocket, originally proposed in 1945 with a unique pressurized cylinder airframe, was revived in the 1950s as an ICBM for the U.S. Air Force using V-2 technology motors in response to the Soviet missile threat. It was first launched in 1957 but its use as an ICBM was soon replaced in 1962 by the room-temperature liquid-fueled Titan II missile, and later by the solid-fueled Minuteman missile. The Atlas rocket transitioned into a civilian launch vehicle and was used for the first orbital crewed U.S. space flights during Project Mercury in 1962 and 1963.

The Atlas rocket became a very reliable booster for launching of satellites and continued to evolve, remaining in use into the 21st century, when combined with the Centaur upper stage to form the Atlas-Centaur launch vehicle for launching geosynchronous communication satellites and space probes. The Centaur rocket was also designed, developed, and produced by Convair, and it was the first widely used outer space rocket to use the all-cryogenic fuel-oxidizer combination of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The use of this liquid hydrogen – liquid oxygen combination in the Centaur was an important direct precursor to the use of the same fuel-oxidizer combination in the Saturn S-II second stage and the Saturn S-IVB third stage of the gigantic Saturn V Moon rocket of the Apollo program. The S-IVB had earlier also been used as the second stage of the smaller Saturn IB rocket, such as the one used to launch Apollo 7. The Centaur upper stage was first designed and developed for launching the Surveyor lunar landers, beginning in 1966, to augment the delta-V of the Atlas rockets and give them enough payload capability to deliver the required mass of the Surveyors to the Moon.

More than 100 Convair-produced Atlas-Centaur rockets (including those with their successor designations) were used to successfully launch over 100 satellites, and among their many other outer-space missions, they launched the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 space probes, the first two to be launched on trajectories that carried them out of the Solar System.

In addition to aircraft, missiles, and space vehicles, Convair developed the large Charactron vacuum tubes, a form of cathode-ray tube (CRT) computer display with a shaped mask to form characters, and to give an example of a minor product, the CORDIC algorithms, which is widely used today to calculate trigonometric functions in calculators, field-programmable gate arrays, and other small electronic systems.

=== Dissolution ===
General Dynamics announced the sale of the Missile Systems Division segment of Convair to Hughes Aircraft Company in May 1992 and the Space Systems Division segment to Martin Marietta in 1994. In July 1994, General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas mutually agreed to terminate Convair&#x27;s contract to provide fuselages for the 300-seat MD-11 airliner. Manufacturing responsibility was to be transferred to McDonnell Douglas, which said it would not preserve the operation in San Diego. General Dynamics had tried for two years to sell the Aircraft structures segment of Convair unit, but the effort ultimately failed.

The termination of the contract meant the end of the Convair Division and of General Dynamics&#x27; presence in San Diego, as well as the city&#x27;s long aircraft-building tradition. The defense contractor once employed 18,000 people there, but after selling its divisions, that number is now zero. General Dynamics closed its complex in Kearny Mesa, demolishing the facility between 1994 and 1996. Homes and offices now occupy the site. The Lindbergh Field plant that produced B-24s during World War II was also demolished and the consolidated rental car facility now occupies this space.

The Fort Worth, Texas factory, constructed to build the B-24s, and its associated engineering locations and laboratories — all previously used to make hundreds of Consolidated B-24s, General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark fighter-bombers and General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons, along with dozens of smaller projects — were sold, along with all intellectual property and the legal rights to the products designed and built within, to the Lockheed Corporation. In 1996, General Dynamics deactivated all of the remaining legal entities of the Convair Division.

<text>Minnie Joycelyn Elders (born Minnie Lee Jones; August 13, 1933) is an American pediatrician and public health administrator who served as Surgeon General of the United States from 1993 to 1994. A vice admiral in the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, she was the second woman, second person of color, and first African American to serve as Surgeon General. 

Elders is known for her frank discussion of her views on controversial issues such as drug legalization, masturbation, and distributing contraception in schools. She was forced to resign in December 1994 amidst controversy as a result of her views. She is currently a professor emerita of pediatrics at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.

==Early life and education==
Elders was born Minnie Lee Jones in Schaal, Arkansas, to a poor, farm sharecropping family, and was the eldest of eight children, and valedictorian of her school class. The family also spent two years near a wartime shipyard in Richmond, California before returning to Schaal. In college, she changed her name to Minnie Joycelyn Lee. In 1952, she received her B.S. degree in Biology from Philander Smith College in Little Rock, Arkansas, where she also pledged Delta Sigma Theta. She married briefly to Cornelius Reynolds, a Federal employee, and later to Oliver Elders, a basketball coach. After working as a nurse&#x27;s aide in a Veterans Administration hospital in Milwaukee for a period, she joined the United States Army in May 1953 and became a second lieutenant. During her 3 years in the Army, she was trained as a physical therapist. She then attended the University of Arkansas Medical School, where she obtained her M.D. degree in 1960. After completing an internship at the University of Minnesota Hospital and a residency in pediatrics at the University of Arkansas Medical Center, Elders earned an M.S. in Biochemistry in 1967.

== Director of Arkansas Department of Health ==
In 1987, then-governor Bill Clinton appointed Elders as Director of the Arkansas Department of Health, making her the first African-American woman in the state to hold this position. Some of her major accomplishments while in office include reducing the teen pregnancy rate by increasing the availability of birth control, counseling, and sex education at school-based clinics; a tenfold increase in early childhood screenings from 1988 to 1992 and a 24 percent rise in the immunization rate for two-year-olds; and an expansion of the availability of HIV testing and counseling services, breast cancer screenings, and better hospice care for the elderly. She also worked hard to promote the importance of sex education, proper hygiene, and prevention of substance abuse in public schools. In 1992, she was elected President of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officers.

== Experiences with racism ==
Elders believed that opposition to her Surgeon General nomination was driven by sexism and racism. &quot;Some people in the American Medical Association, a certain group of them, didn&#x27;t even know that I was a physician. They were passing a resolution to say that from now on every Surgeon General must be a physician—which was a knock at me. ... They don&#x27;t expect a black female to have accomplished what I have and to have done the things that I have.&quot;

During an interview, she was asked if she related to Shirley Chisholm&#x27;s statement about feeling more oppressed as a woman than as an African American, and replied by saying, &quot;I am who I am because I&#x27;m a black woman.&quot; Elders was able to be the voice for the African-American community and speak on poverty and its role in teenage pregnancy, which is a major issue within the community. Poor African-American teenage mothers are &quot;captive to a slavery the 13th Amendment did not anticipate,&quot; which is a major reason why she stressed the importance of teaching sex education in public schools.

== Views on sex education ==
As an endocrinologist, Elders was especially concerned with young diabetic women getting pregnant. If young teen women who have diabetes get pregnant, they have a high chance of their bodies rejecting the fetus or the fetus developing abnormalities &quot;in utero&quot;. To prevent these pregnancies from happening, she thoroughly talked to her patients about the dangers of early pregnancy and the importance of using contraceptives, and taking control of their sexuality as soon as they began puberty. Of the approximately 260 young diabetic women she treated, only one of them became pregnant.

=== Sex education for young African-American women ===
Elders strongly advocated sex and reproductive education, especially in African-American communities. She criticized older textbooks that said only white females had naturally regular periods, because white females were on birth control to regulate their periods. Black females did not readily seek out birth control because their &quot;[black] ministers were up on the pulpit saying the birth control pills were black genocide.&quot; She was very vocal about her disgust with black men exploiting black women and stripping them of their reproductive health choices, because &quot;If you can&#x27;t control your reproduction, you can&#x27;t control your life.&quot;

==Surgeon General of the United States==
Elders has received a National Institutes of Health career development award, also serving as assistant professor in pediatrics at the University of Arkansas Medical Center from 1967. She was promoted to associate professor in 1971 and professor in 1976. Her research interests focused on endocrinology, and she received board certification as a pediatric endocrinologist in 1978, becoming the first person in the state of Arkansas to do so. Elders received a D.Sc. degree from Bates College in 2002.

In January 1993, Bill Clinton appointed her as the United States Surgeon General, making her the first African American and the second woman (following Antonia Novello) to hold the position. At her confirmation hearing, Elders responded to criticism over an incident in which she decided not to notify the public that condoms her department had been distributing in Arkansas had been found to be defective, with a failure rate ten times the allowed rate. Elders said that &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; whether the decision had been correct, but she had believed at the time that public disclosure could lead to a public loss of faith in the efficacy of condoms, which would have been the greater danger. She was a controversial choice and a strong backer of the Clinton health care plan, so she was not confirmed until September 7, 1993. As Surgeon General, Elders quickly established a reputation for being controversial. Like many of the Surgeons General before her, she was an outspoken advocate of a variety of health-related causes. She argued for an exploration of the possibility of drug legalization, and backed the distribution of contraceptives in schools. President Clinton stood by Elders, saying that she was misunderstood.

===Views on drug legalization===
Elders drew fire, as well as censure from the Clinton administration, when she suggested that legalizing drugs might help reduce crime and that the idea should be studied. On December 15, 1993, around one week after making these comments, charges were filed against her son Kevin for selling cocaine in an incident involving undercover officers four months prior. Elders believes the incident was a frame-up and the timing of the charges was designed to embarrass her and the president. Kevin Elders was convicted, and he was sentenced to 10 years in prison, of which he served four months. He appealed his conviction to the Arkansas Supreme Court, and that court affirmed the conviction. The court held that Elders failed to show that he was entrapped into making the narcotics sale. There was no further appeal.

===Comments on abortion and masturbation===

In January 1994 in the context of abortion, Elders said, &quot;We really need to get over this love affair with the fetus and start worrying about children.&quot;

Later that year, she was invited to speak at a United Nations conference on AIDS. She was asked whether it would be appropriate to promote masturbation as a means of preventing young people from engaging in riskier forms of sexual activity, and she replied, &quot;As per your specific question in regard to masturbation, I think that is something that is a part of human sexuality and it&#x27;s a part of something that perhaps should be taught. But we&#x27;ve not even taught our children the very basics. And I feel that we have tried ignorance for a very long time and it&#x27;s time we try education.&quot;

=== Resignation ===
Elders&#x27; comments on masturbation caused great controversy and resulted in Elders losing the support of the White House. Clinton&#x27;s chief of staff, Leon Panetta, remarked, &quot;There have been too many areas where the President does not agree with her views. This is just one too many.&quot; In December 1994, Elders was forced to resign by President Clinton. This led sex-positive retailer Good Vibrations in 1995 to proclaim May 28 as National Masturbation Day in honor of Elders&#x27; advocacy.

A collection of Elders&#x27; professional papers is held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.

==Post-governmental activities==

Since leaving her post as Surgeon General, Elders has returned to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences as professor of pediatrics, and is currently professor emerita at UAMS. She is a regular on the lecture circuit, speaking against teen pregnancy. She has appeared on TV in &quot;Penn and Teller: Bullshit!&quot; during the episode on abstinence, where she says that she considers abstinence-only programs to be child abuse and discusses her opinions on teenage sex education, masturbation and contraceptives. In 2009 Elders teamed up with the University of Minnesota to establish the nation&#x27;s first chair in Sexual Health Education, a fund to attract and retain outstanding tenured sexual health education faculty in the Program in Human Sexuality at the University of Minnesota Medical School. She is interviewed in the 2013 documentary &quot;How to Lose Your Virginity&quot; on her opinions regarding comprehensive sex education versus abstinence-only sex education.

Elders was inducted into the Arkansas Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2016.

In 2015, Philander Smith College, Elders&#x27; &quot;alma mater&quot;, established the Dr. Joycelyn Elders School of Allied and Public Health.

In an October 15, 2010, article, she clearly voiced support for legalization of marijuana:

In 1997, Elders published a memoir.

She received a Candace Award from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women in 1991. She was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa as an &quot;honoris causa&quot; initiate at SUNY Plattsburgh in 1996.

<text>United Empire Loyalist (UEL; or simply Loyalist) is an honorific title which was first given by the 1st Lord Dorchester, the Governor of Quebec and Governor General of the Canadas, to American Loyalists who resettled in British North America during or after the American Revolution. At that time, the demonym &quot;Canadian&quot; or &quot;Canadien&quot; was used by the descendants of New France settlers inhabiting the Province of Quebec.

They settled primarily in Nova Scotia and the Province of Quebec. The influx of loyalist settlers resulted in the creation of several new colonies. In 1784, New Brunswick was partitioned from the Colony of Nova Scotia after significant loyalist resettlement around the Bay of Fundy. The influx of loyalist refugees also resulted in the Province of Quebec&#x27;s division into Lower Canada (present-day Quebec), and Upper Canada (present-day Ontario) in 1791. The Crown gave them land grants of one lot. One lot consisted of per person to encourage their resettlement, as the Government wanted to develop the frontier of Upper Canada. This resettlement added many English speakers to the Canadian population. It was the beginning of new waves of immigration that established a predominantly Anglo-Canadian population in the future Canada both west and east of the modern Quebec border.

==History==
===American Revolution===

Following the end of the American Revolutionary War and the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, both Loyalist soldiers and civilians were evacuated from New York City, most heading for Canada. Many Loyalists had already migrated to Canada, especially from New York and northern New England, where violence against them had increased during the war.

The Crown-allotted land in Canada was sometimes allotted according to which Loyalist regiment a man had fought in. This Loyalist resettlement was critical to the development of present-day Ontario, and some 10,000 refugees went to Quebec (including the Eastern Townships and modern-day Ontario). But Nova Scotia (including modern-day New Brunswick) received three times that number: about 35,000–40,000 Loyalist refugees.

An unknown but substantial number of individuals did not stay; they eventually returned to the United States. As some families split in their loyalties during the war years, many Loyalists in Canada continued to maintain close ties with relatives in the United States. They conducted commerce across the border with little regard to British trade laws. In the 1790s, the offer of land and low taxes, which were one-quarter those in America, for allegiance by Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe resulted in the arrival of 30,000 Americans often referred to as Late Loyalists. By the outbreak of the War of 1812, of the 110,000 inhabitants of Upper Canada, 20,000 were the initial Loyalists, 60,000 were later American immigrants and their descendants, and 30,000 were immigrants from the UK, their descendants or from the Old Province of Quebec. The later arrival of many of the inhabitants of Upper Canada suggests that land was the main reason for immigration.

===Resettlement===

The arrival of the Loyalists after the Revolutionary War led to the division of Canada into the provinces of Upper Canada (what is now southern Ontario) and Lower Canada (today&#x27;s southern Quebec). They arrived and were largely settled in groups by ethnicity and religion. Many soldiers settled with others of the regiments they had served with. The settlers came from every social class and all thirteen colonies, unlike the depiction of them in the Sandham painting which suggests the arrivals were well-dressed upper-class immigrants.

Loyalists soon petitioned the government to be allowed to use the British legal system, which they were accustomed to in the American colonies, rather than the French system. Great Britain had maintained the French legal system and allowed freedom of religion after taking over the former French colony with the defeat of France in the Seven Years&#x27; War. With the creation of Upper and Lower Canada, most Loyalists in the west could live under British laws and institutions. The predominantly ethnic French population of Lower Canada, who were still French-speaking, could maintain their familiar French civil law and Catholic religion.

Realizing the importance of some type of recognition, on 9 November 1789, Lord Dorchester, the governor of Quebec and Governor General of British North America, declared &quot;that it was his Wish to put the mark of Honour upon the Families who had adhered to the Unity of the Empire&quot;. As a result of Dorchester&#x27;s statement, the printed militia rolls carried the notation:

Those Loyalists who have adhered to the Unity of the Empire, and joined the Royal Standard before the Treaty of Separation in the year 1783, and all their Children and their Descendants by either sex, are to be distinguished by the following Capitals, affixed to their names: UE or U.E. Alluding to their great principle The Unity of the Empire.

Because most of the nations of the Iroquois had allied with the British, which had ceded their lands to the United States, thousands of Iroquois and other pro-British Native Americans were expelled from New York and other states. They were also resettled in Canada. Many of the Iroquois, led by Joseph Brant &quot;Thayendenegea&quot;, settled at Six Nations of the Grand River, the largest First Nations reserve in Canada. A smaller group of Iroquois led by Captain John Deserontyon &quot;Odeserundiye&quot;, settled on the shores of the Bay of Quinte in modern-day southeastern Ontario.
The government settled some 3,500 Black Loyalists in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, but they faced discrimination and the same inadequate support that all Loyalists experienced. Delays in making land grants, but mostly the willingness of the blacks to under-cut their fellow Loyalists and hire themselves out to the few available jobs at a lower wage aggravated racist tensions in Shelburne. Mobs of white Loyalists attacked Black Loyalists in the Shelburne Riots in July 1784, Canada&#x27;s first so-called &quot;race&quot; riot. The government was slow to survey the land of Black Loyalists (which meant they could not settle); it was also discriminatory in granting them smaller, poorer, and more remote lands than those of white settlers; not counting those Loyalists who were resettled in what would become Upper Canada, in general, or around the Bay of Quinte, in specific. This increased their difficulties in becoming established. The majority of Black Loyalists in Canada were refugees from the American South; they suffered from this discrimination and the harsh winters.

When Great Britain set up the colony of Sierra Leone in Africa, nearly 1,300 Black Loyalists emigrated there in 1792 for the promise of self-government. And so 2,200 remained. The Black Loyalists that left established Freetown in Sierra Leone. Well into the 20th century, together with other early settlers from Jamaica and slaves liberated from illegal slave ships, and despite vicious attacks from the indigenous peoples that nearly ended the Maroon colony, they and their descendants dominated the culture, economy and government of Sierra Leone.

Numerous Loyalists had been forced to abandon substantial amounts of property in the United States. Britain sought restoration or compensation for this lost property from the United States, which was a major issue during the negotiation of the Jay Treaty in 1795. Negotiations settled on the concept of the United States negotiators &quot;advising&quot; the U.S. Congress to provide restitution. For the British, this concept carried significant legal weight, far more than it did to the Americans; the U.S. Congress declined to accept the advice.

====Slavery====
Slave-owning Loyalists from across the former Thirteen Colonies brought their slaves with them to Canada, as the practice was still legal there. They took a total of about 2,000 slaves to British North America: 500 in Upper Canada (Ontario), 300 in Lower Canada (Quebec), and 1,200 in the Maritime colonies of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. The presence and condition of slaves in the Maritimes would become a particular issue. They constituted a larger portion of the population, but it was not an area of plantation agriculture.

The settlers eventually freed many of these slaves. Together with the free Black Loyalists, many chose to go to Sierra Leone in 1792 and following years, seeking a chance for self-government. Meanwhile, the British Parliament passed the Settlers in American Colonies Act 1790 (30 Geo. 3. c. 27) that assured prospective immigrants to Canada that they could retain their slaves as property. In 1793, an anti-slavery law was passed, in the 1st Parliament of Upper Canada. The &quot;Act Against Slavery&quot; banned the importation of slaves into the colony, and mandated the emancipation of all children born henceforth to female slaves upon reaching the age of 25. The Act was partially introduced due to the influx of the number of slaves brought by Loyalist refugees to Upper Canada. The slave trade was abolished across the British Empire in 1807. The institution of slavery was abolished Empire-wide by 1834 (except in India, where it was considered an indigenous institution).

===War of 1812===

From 1812 to 1815, the United States and the United Kingdom were engaged in a conflict known as the War of 1812. On 18 June 1812, US President James Madison signed the declaration of war into law, after receiving heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress.

By 1812, Upper Canada had been settled mostly by Revolution-era Loyalists from the United States (United Empire Loyalists) and postwar American and British immigrants. The Canadas were thinly populated and only lightly defended by the British Army and the sedentary units of the Canadian Militia. American leaders assumed that Canada could be easily overrun, with former president Thomas Jefferson optimistically describing the potential conquest of Canada as &quot;a matter of marching&quot;. Many Loyalist Americans had migrated to Upper Canada after the Revolutionary War. However, there was also a significant number of non-Loyalist American settlers in the area due to the offer of land grants to immigrants. The Americans assumed the latter population would favour the American cause, but they did not. Although the population of Upper Canada included recent settlers from the United States who had no obvious loyalties to the Crown, the American forces found strong opposition from settlers during the War of 1812.

A number of loyalists served as fencibles, provincial regulars, in the Provincial Marine, or with the sedentary militia. With the successful defence of the Canadian colonies from American invasion, the War of 1812 is seen by Loyalists as a victory. After the war, the British government transported to New Brunswick and settled about 400 of 3,000 former slaves from the United States whom they freed during and after the war. It had fulfilled its promise to them of freedom if they left Patriot slaveholders and fought with the British. Enslaved African Americans risked considerable danger by crossing to British lines to achieve freedom.

===Present===
While the honorific &quot;United Empire Loyalist&quot; is not part of the official Canadian honours system, modern-day descendants of Loyalist refugees may employ it, sometimes using &quot;U.E.&quot; as postnominal letters. The practice, however, is uncommon today, even in original Loyalist strongholds like southeastern Ontario. Historians and genealogists use it extensively as a shorthand for identifying the ancestry of particular families.

The influence of the Loyalists on the evolution of Canada remains evident. Their ties with Britain and antipathy to the United States provided the strength needed to keep Canada independent and distinct in North America. The Loyalists&#x27; basic distrust of republicanism and &quot;mob rule&quot; influenced Canada&#x27;s gradual, &quot;paper-strewn&quot; path to independence. The new British North American provinces of Upper Canada (the forerunner of Ontario) and New Brunswick were created as places of refuge for the United Empire Loyalists. The mottoes of the two provinces reflect this history: Ontario&#x27;s, also found on its coat of arms, is &quot;Ut incepit fidelis sic permanet&quot; (&quot;Loyal she began, loyal she remains&quot;); New Brunswick&#x27;s, &quot;Spem Reduxit&quot; (&quot;Hope restored&quot;).

The word &quot;Loyalist&quot; appears frequently in school, street, and business names in such Loyalist-settled communities as Belleville, Ontario. The nearby city of Kingston, established as a Loyalist stronghold, was named in honour of King George III. And on the outskirts of that city is a township simply named &quot;Loyalist&quot;.

Canada&#x27;s 2021 Census estimates a population of 10,015 who identify as having United Empire Loyalist origins, based on a 25% sample.

On 1 July 1934, Royal Mail Canada issued &quot;United Empire Loyalists, 1776–1784&quot; designed by Robert Bruce McCracken based on Sydney March&#x27;s sculpture &quot;United Empire Loyalists&quot;.

In 1996, Canadian politicians Peter Milliken (a descendant of American Loyalists) and John Godfrey sponsored the Godfrey–Milliken Bill, which would have entitled Loyalist descendants to reclaim ancestral property in the United States which had been confiscated during the American Revolution. The bill, which did not pass the House of Commons, was intended primarily as a satirical response to the contemporaneous American Helms–Burton Act.

In 1997, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario passed a bill declaring 19 June, &quot;United Empire Loyalist Day&quot; in Ontario. United Empire Loyalist Day is also celebrated on the same day in Saskatchewan, on 18 May in New Brunswick and on 22 July in British Columbia.

==Memory and historiography==
The Loyalists paid attention to their history developing an idealized image of themselves in which they took great pride. In 1898, Henry Coyne provided a glowing depiction:
According to Canadian historians Margaret Conrad and Alvin Finkel, Coyne&#x27;s memorial incorporates essential themes that have often been incorporated into patriotic celebrations. The Loyalist tradition, as explicated by Murray Barkley and Norman Knowles, includes:
Conrad and Finkel point out some exaggerations: only a small percentage of the Loyalists were colonial elite. In fact Loyalists were drawn from every stratum of colonial society, and few suffered violence and hardship. About 20 percent would later return to the United States. Most were loyal to all things British, but other Loyalists supported the United States in the War of 1812. Conrad and Finkel conclude:

From the 1870s, many of their descendants returned to the United States in pursuit of cheaper land. In the New England states alone, more than 10% of the population can trace their roots to the Maritime Provinces. Two million more of 14 million inhabitants, or roughly 15%, are part or wholly of French Canadian descent.

==United Empire Loyalists&#x27; Association==

The United Empire Loyalists&#x27; Association of Canada (UELAC) is an organization of Loyalist descendants and others interested in Canadian history, in particular the role of the United Empire Loyalists. The organization was incorporated on 27 May 1914 by the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. In 1972, the organization was granted a coat of arms from the College of Arms through a letter patent, dated 28 March 1972.

==Symbols==

On 17 April 1707, Queen Anne issued a proclamation referencing the use of the Union Flag &quot;at Sea and Land&quot;. The Union Flag began to appear on forts and as regimental colours from this point, and at the time of the American Revolution, this was the flag in use. When those loyal to the Crown left the United States for British North America, they took this flag with them, and because of this historical connection, it continues to be the official flag of the UELAC.

In Canadian heraldry, Loyalist descendants are entitled to use a Loyalist coronet in their coat of arms.

<text>Sergeant (Sgt, etymologically: &#x27;servant&#x27;), is a rank in use by the armed forces of many countries. It is also a police rank in some police services. The alternative spelling, &quot;serjeant&quot;, is used in The Rifles and in other units that draw their heritage from the British light infantry. The word &quot;sergeant&quot; derives from the Latin , &#x27;one who serves&#x27;, through the Old French term .

In modern hierarchies the term &quot;sergeant&quot; refers to a non-commissioned officer positioned above the rank of a corporal, and to a police officer immediately below a lieutenant in the US, and below an inspector in the UK. In most armies, the rank of sergeant corresponds to command of a team/section, or squad. In Commonwealth armies, it is a more senior rank, corresponding roughly to a platoon second-in-command. In the United States Army, sergeant is a more junior rank corresponding to a fireteam leader or assistant squad-leader; while in the United States Marine Corps the rank is typically held by squad leaders. 

More senior non-commissioned ranks often have titles with variations on &quot;sergeant&quot;, for example: staff sergeant, gunnery sergeant, master sergeant, first sergeant, and sergeant major.

In many nations and services, the rank insignia for a sergeant features three chevrons.

== History ==
In medieval European usage, a sergeant was simply any attendant or officer with a protective duty. Any medieval knight or military order of knighthood might have &quot;sergeants-at-arms&quot;, meaning servants able to fight if needed. The etymology of the term is from Anglo-French , &quot;servant, valet, court official, soldier&quot;, from Middle Latin &quot;servant, vassal, soldier&quot;.

Later, a &quot;soldier sergeant&quot; was a man of what would now be thought of as the &quot;middle class&quot;, fulfilling a slightly junior role to the knight in the medieval hierarchy. Sergeants could fight either as heavy cavalry, light cavalry, or as trained professional infantry; either spearmen or crossbowmen. Most notable medieval mercenaries fell into the &quot;sergeant&quot; class, such as Flemish crossbowmen and spearmen, who were seen as reliable quality troops. The sergeant class was deemed to be &#x27;worth half of a knight&#x27; in military value.

A specific kind of military sergeant was the serjeant-at-arms, one of a body of armed men retained by English lords and monarchs. The title is now given to an officer in modern legislative bodies who is charged with keeping order during meetings and, if necessary, forcibly removing disruptive members.

The term had also civilian applications quite distinct and different from the military sergeant, though sharing the etymological origin – for example the serjeant-at-law, historically an important and prestigious order of English lawyers.

== Types of sergeant ==
&quot;Sergeant&quot; is generally the lowest rank of sergeant, with individual military entities choosing some additional words to signify higher-ranking individuals. What terms are used, and what seniority they signify, is to a great extent dependent on the individual armed service. The term &quot;sergeant&quot; is also used in many appointment titles.

== Current adaptations == 
In most non-naval military or paramilitary organizations, the various grades of sergeant are non-commissioned officers (NCOs) ranking above privates and corporals, and below warrant officers and commissioned officers. The responsibilities of a sergeant differ from army to army. There are usually several ranks of sergeant, each corresponding to greater experience and responsibility for the daily lives of the soldiers of larger units. In police forces, sergeants are usually team leaders in charge of an entire team of constables to senior constables at large stations, to being in charge of sectors involving several police stations. In country areas, sergeants are often in charge of an entire station and its constabulary. Senior sergeants are usually in specialist areas and are in charge of sergeants and thus act as middle management.

=== Australia ===
Sergeant (Sgt) is a rank in both the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force. The ranks are equivalent to each other and the Royal Australian Navy rank of petty officer.

Although the rank insignia of the RAAF rank of flight sergeant (Flt Sgt) and the Australian Army rank of staff sergeant (SSgt) are identical, flight sergeant in fact outranks the rank of staff sergeant in the classification of rank equivalencies. The Australian Army rank of staff sergeant is now redundant and is no longer awarded, due to being outside the rank equivalencies and the next promotional rank is warrant officer class two. Chief petty officers and flight sergeants are not required to call a warrant officer class two &quot;sir&quot; in accordance with Australian Defence Force Regulations 1952 (Regulation 8).

The rank of sergeant exists in all Australian police forces and is of higher ranking than a constable or senior constable, but lower than an inspector.

The sergeant structure varies among state police forces, generally two sergeant ranks are commonly classed as non-commissioned officers:
* Sergeant (Sgt) (three chevrons); and
* Senior sergeant (Sen Sgt) (three chevrons, crown surmounted by a laurel leaf)

South Australia Police has the additional rank of brevet sergeant (two chevrons below an inverted arrow head) which is an authorization for a temporarily higher rank. A brevet sergeant is less senior than a sergeant.

New South Wales Police Force has the additional rank of incremental sergeant (three chevrons and a crown). This is an incremental progression, following an appointment as a sergeant for seven years. An incremental sergeant rank is less senior than a senior sergeant but is more senior than a sergeant.

Upon appointment as a sergeant or senior sergeant, the sergeant is given:
* A warrant of appointment under the commissioner&#x27;s hand and seal.
* A navy blue backing (which replaces a light blue backing to the officer&#x27;s police badge)
* A navy blue nameplate (which replaces a light blue nameplate)
* A silver chinstrap positioned above his peaked cap on his headdress, replacing a black chinstrap.

Within the New South Wales Police Force, a sergeant is a team leader or supervisory rank, whilst the rank of senior sergeant is a middle management rank with coordination responsibilities over human and physical resources.

All three sergeant ranks are informally referred to as &quot;sergeant&quot;, or &quot;sarge&quot;. However, at the New South Wales Police Academy, recruits must address all ranks of sergeants as &quot;sergeant&quot;, and senior sergeants as &quot;senior sergeant&quot;.

=== Canada ===

==== Army and Air Force ====
Sergeant (Sgt) ( or ) is an Army or Air Force non-commissioned officer rank of the Canadian Armed Forces. Its naval equivalent is petty officer 2nd class (). It is senior to the appointment of master corporal and its equivalent naval appointment, master seaman, and junior to warrant officer and its naval equivalent, petty officer 1st class. Sergeants and petty officers 2nd class are the only senior non-commissioned officers in the Canadian Armed Forces, as WOs, MWOs and CWOs are warrant officers, not senior NCOs in accordance with the Queens Regulations and Orders. Volume 1, Article 102 &quot;Definitions&quot;.

In army units, sergeants usually serve as section commanders; they may often be called to fill positions normally held by warrant officers, such as platoon or troop warrant, company quartermaster sergeant, chief clerk, etc.

The rank insignia of a sergeant is a three-bar chevron, worn point down, surmounted by a maple leaf. Embroidered rank badges are worn in &quot;CF gold&quot; thread on rifle green Melton, stitched to the upper sleeves of the service dress jacket; as miniature gold metal and rifle-green enamel badges on the collars of the army dress shirt and army outerwear jackets; in &quot;old-gold&quot; thread on air force blue slip-ins on air force shirts, sweaters, and coats; and in a tan thread on CADPAT slip-ins (army) or dark blue thread on olive-drab slip-ins (air force) on the operational dress uniform.

Colour sergeant in the Canadian Armed Forces is not a rank of sergeant, but a warrant officer in one of the two Foot Guards regiments (the Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards and the Canadian Grenadier Guards). Likewise, a sergeant-major (including regimental sergeant-major) is not a sergeant rank, but an appointment held by a master warrant officer or chief warrant officer.

Sergeants generally mess and billet with warrant officers, master warrant officers, and chief warrant officers, and their naval counterparts, chief petty officers and petty officers. Their mess on military bases or installations is generally named the warrant officers&#x27; and sergeants&#x27; mess.

Historically, the rank of sergeant was severely downgraded after unification of the three services in 1968. An army sergeant before unification was generally employed in supervisory positions, such as the second in command of a platoon-sized unit (i.e. an infantry platoon sergeant, or troop sergeant in an armoured unit). After unification, sergeants were downgraded in status to section commander, a job previously held by corporals, and the former &quot;platoon/troop sergeants&quot; were replaced by &quot;platoon/troop warrant officers&quot;.

==== Police ====
Police forces across Canada also use the rank of sergeant and staff sergeant for senior non-commissioned officers above the rank of constable or corporal. Except in the province of Quebec and in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the insignia for a police sergeant is three chevrons, worn point down. Staff sergeants rank above sergeants and are responsible for a unit or team within a station or division. The insignia for a staff sergeant is three chevrons, worn point down surmounted by a royal crown. In the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the insignia for a sergeant is three chevrons, worn point down surmounted by a royal crown (which is the insignia of a staff sergeant in other Canadian police forces). The insignia of a staff sergeant in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is four chevrons worn point up.

=== Denmark ===
In the Danish Defence, sergeants are typically squad (6-12 soldiers) or section commanders. The sergeants in the Danish forces also act as drill sergeants and platoon instructors, training both new soldiers in basic training, as well as professional soldiers. Sergeants with 1–2 years in the rank, who are in basic training units, are often second-in-command of the platoon.

In professional units, the role of second-in-command in the platoon is sometimes given to a very experienced sergeant, but in most cases will be a Senior sergeant (), the rank above sergeant.

Sergeants in the Danish military are instructors in military drill, weapons, field-craft, small unit tactics, and physical training.

=== Finland ===
==== Army ====
 (Finnish language abrv. kers.) or &quot;Sergeant&quot; (swedish language abrv. Serg) is in Finnish Defence Forces the second lowest non-commissioned officer rank. The rank is carried by conscripts, reservists and professional soldiers. Conscripts and salaried soldiers with the rank of sergeant are distinguished from each other by their insignia. Conscripts and reservists have three chevrons, whereas salaried personnel have three chevrons and a sword in the insignia.

Sergeant is the highest non-commissioned officer rank that a conscript who has completed the junior NCO course ( in Finnish) can reach before entering the reserve. The lowest and most common non-commissioned officer rank is (lit. &quot;lower sergeant&quot;); see corporal.

Only a few non-commissioned officers in each conscript company reach the higher rank of full three-chevron . There&#x27;s no difference between the 4-month squad leader training and service time of and ; all start their squad leader tour with the lower rank and the optional promotion is based on the superior&#x27;s assessment of individual performance and intended duties in the wartime organization; special roles such as that of platoon sergeant or company first sergeant are typically reserved for and upwards.

A corporal can also obtain the rank of sergeant (and possibly above, the next rank being four-chevron , which is comparable to staff sergeant) by taking some military refresher courses while in reserve, or by enlisting to (short-term) professional service in the military.

=== France ===

==== Army ====
French sergeant ranks are used by the air force, engineers, infantry, Foreign Legion, , communications, administrative service, and . Other branches of the army and use the equivalent ranks of (&quot;marshal of lodgings&quot; in English) instead of sergeant ranks.

There were three sergeant ranks in France, although the most junior, contract sergeant, has been superseded by student sub-officer now that conscription has been suspended. When the army contained a large proportion of conscripts, contract sergeant was very common as a rank for conscripts considered to have leadership potential. In general the term was used for both contract sergeant and career sergeant. Contract sergeant was classified as the lowest sub-officer rank, the rank below being chief corporal.
* Student sub-officer, (formerly &quot;contract sergeant&quot;, ): One chevron, gold or silver. &quot;Contract sergeant&quot; was a rank used for junior sergeants, either conscripts or reservists. The rank insignia is used nowadays for students. After a certain amount of time, a student sub-officer is entitled to be addressed &quot;sergeant&quot;.
* Sergeant, (formerly &quot;career sergeant&quot;, ): Two chevrons.Normal sergeant rank, though normally directly recruited from civilian life into the sub-officer ranks, so the rank implies less experience and higher academic requirements than for a commonwealth sergeant. As a typical rank for the command of a squad (typically eight soldiers), a tank, or a gun, this rank is roughly equivalent to a commonwealth corporal, a US Army staff sergeant, or a US Marine Corps sergeant.
* Principal sergeant, : Three chevrons.With long service, a sergeant&#x27;s promotion to chief sergeant is automatic. Typically being a platoon second-in-command, the holder of this rank is therefore equivalent to a commonwealth sergeant or a US &quot;sergeant first class&quot;. The next rank up is adjutant.

=== Germany ===

The was introduced 1843 and was used until 1921, when the rank was changed to .
The current rank used in the which is equal to an American/British sergeant is the rank of .

=== Ireland ===

==== Army ====
Sergeant (Sgt) ( in Irish) is the second rank of non-commissioned officer within the Irish Army. The naval equivalent is petty officer.

The army rank insignia consists of three winged chevrons (or &quot;stripes&quot;). The service dress insignia consists of three wavy red chevrons 9 cm wide bordered in yellow. The main infantry role of a sergeant is as second-in-command of a platoon or commander of a fire support section of a weapons platoon, such as an anti-tank or mortar platoon. Another role is that of company clerk and instructor. There are higher ranks of company sergeant and company quartermaster sergeant. Artillery sergeants are usually assigned as detachment and section commanders, as well as in administrative roles. The difference in roles of sergeant and corporal in the artillery corps is not as clearly defined as in the infantry corps.

Sergeant is also the second rank of non-commissioned officer in the Irish Air Corps. Before 1994, the Air Corps was considered part of the army and wore army uniforms with distinct corps badges, but the same rank insignia. With the introduction of a unique Air Corps blue uniform in 1994, the same rank markings in a white colour were worn, before the introduction of a new three-chevron with wing rank marking. There are higher ranks of flight sergeant and flight quartermaster sergeant.

==== Police ====
Sergeant is the second rank in the , above and below inspector.

Sergeants appointed as detectives use the rank title detective sergeant (DS). They do not outrank regular sergeants, the &#x27;detective&#x27; prefix indicates that they are permanently allocated to detective duties.

=== Israel ===

==== Defense forces ====

In the Israel Defense Forces, soldiers are promoted from corporal to sergeant after approximately 18 months of service (16 for combatants), if they performed their duties appropriately during this time, and did not have disciplinary problems. Soldiers who take a commander&#x27;s course may become sergeants earlier. Sergeants get a symbolic pay raise of 1.80 NIS.

The Hebrew name for the rank is originated as an acronym for (&quot;supernumerary lieutenant&quot;) (inspired by the abbreviation &quot;NCO&quot;). Nowadays is no longer treated as an acronym or an abbreviation .

==== Police ====
In the Israeli Police, sergeant is the third rank, coming after constable and corporal. Officers are promoted to this rank after a year as a corporal, or after 20 months of service in total. Excelling officers may be promoted to this rank (or any other rank) in up to 6 months instead of a year.

=== Russia ===

==== Armed Forces ====
Within the Russian Armed Forces, there are three ranks which are explicitly sergeant ranks: junior sergeant (, ), sergeant (, ) and senior sergeant (, ). There is also a rank called &quot;&quot; (), which is often translated as &quot;master sergeant&quot;. These ranks are inherited from the Soviet Union.

In the Soviet Army, most sergeants (with the exception of the aforementioned ) were not career non-commissioned officers but specially trained conscripts; the rank of was reserved for career non-commissioned officers. In the modern Russian army, there are attempts to change this system and make most or all sergeants career non-commissioned officers; they are met with limited success.

==== Police ====
Unlike most police forces of the world, in the Russian police sergeant is a starting, entry-level rank. Ranks of &quot;policeman&quot; or &quot;senior policeman&quot; are not used in Russia (the rank of &quot;private of police&quot; technically exists but is rare, and most recruits become sergeants right away). It is divided into three grades the same way as the army sergeant rank.

=== Singapore ===

==== Singapore Armed Forces ====
In the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), there are five different grades of sergeant: third sergeant (3SG), second sergeant (2SG), first sergeant (1SG), staff sergeant (SSG), and master sergeant (MSG). Sergeants are considered specialists in the SAF. They are equivalent to the non-commissioned officers of other militaries.

Soldiers must complete their specialist course at the Specialist Cadet School, formerly known as the School of Infantry Specialists (SISPEC) or other training institutes before being promoted to third sergeant. While active duty national servicemen may be promoted to second sergeant, most personnel holding ranks above that are career soldiers.

Promotion from third sergeant to staff sergeant takes an average of 6 years, although there are many factors that may cause a soldier&#x27;s promotion to cease. These factors include failure to pass an annual physical fitness proficiency test, poor performance, or being charged for offences.

Third sergeants are usually section commanders. They may also hold certain logistics or administrative posts such as company quartermaster sergeant. Second sergeants usually serve as platoon sergeants. First sergeants, staff sergeants and master sergeants usually serve as company sergeant majors or administrative specialists at company level or higher.

==== Home Team ====
In the Singapore Police Force, Singapore Civil Defence Force, Singapore Prison Service and Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, the rank of sergeant lies between corporal and staff sergeant. Unlike most police forces in the world, the rank of sergeant has been changed since the late 1990s to an entry-level rank for Diploma/GCE &quot;A&quot; Level holders rather than a supervisory one.

==== Uniformed Youth Organisations ====
In the National Cadet Corps (NCC), the rank of third sergeant is below second sergeant, and above corporal. In the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) and the National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC), the rank of sergeant is below staff sergeant, and above corporal. The rank of third sergeant and sergeant is held by cadets who have been appointed as non-commissioned officers by their units and thus have the power to command a squad.

NPCC and NCDCC sergeants wear a rank insignia of three pointed-down chevrons, with the letters &#x27;NPCC&#x27; and &#x27;NCDCC&#x27; located below the insignia, so as to differentiate NPCC and NCDCC cadets from Singapore Police Force and Singapore Civil Defence Force personnel respectively.

NCC third sergeants, second sergeants and first sergeants wear a rank insignia of three pointed-down chevrons, three pointed-down chevrons with one pointed-up chevron and three pointed-down chevrons with two pointed up-chevrons respectively, all with the letters &#x27;NCC&#x27; located below the insignia, so as to differentiate NCC cadets from Singapore Armed Forces personnel.

In the St John Brigade (SJB), the rank of sergeant is above corporal and below staff sergeant. It is usually held by a non-commissioned officer.

=== Sweden ===

==== Army ====
In Sweden, is the most junior specialist officers rank above (a squad leader at skill level C (advanced)) and below . The Swedish rank system comprises two different types of officers, &quot;specialist officers&quot; (in other countries categorized as NCO:s) and &quot;tactical officers&quot;. Though marked as OR 6 to OR 9, the Swedish rank system is that of a parallel system, and both officer categories mentioned above are recognized as officers according to the stipulations of commission, given by Swedish parliament. The rank of (OR 7) is superior to that of a second lieutenant (OF1). An individual officer can transition during a career between serving as a tactical officer or specialist officer, depending on what kind of role the officer are serving in and if one meets the qualifications to transfer. Specialist Officers ranking from OR7 to OR9 can be found in the same tactical and strategical levels as tactical officers, for example in staff positions on brigade and higher tactical levels, as advanced and skilled specialist or staff section commanders.

The creation of the specialist officers corps in 2008, meant that many former officers from OR 1b to OR 3 where commissioned to the ranks of OR 7 - OR 9.

From 1983 to 2008 there was only one professional officers corps within the Swedish armed forces (OF 1 to OF 9). All OR-ranks where hold by conscripts.

Historically, the role of the specialist officer, until 1972 categorised as &quot;underofficer&quot; in Sweden is reminiscent of that of a senior non-commissioned officer in Germany (), hence there was a third stipulated &quot;corps&quot; of junior commanding ranks, that of the , in direct translation &quot;sub commanders&quot; or &quot;junior leader ranks&quot;, comprising the equivalents to the ranks of corporal (OR 4), (OR5) and (OR5b). This former &quot;corps&quot; (until 1983) was much like that of the senior ranks within the different German-speaking armed forces. These ranks are today held by long serving and skilled professional or reservist soldiers, but are distinctly not specialist officers ranks.

In order to be appointed sergeant (until 2019 &quot;first sergeant&quot;) in today&#x27;s Swedish armed forces, it is required that the candidate have completed specialist officer training (1.5years).

=== United Kingdom ===

==== Royal Marines and British Army ====
A sergeant in the Royal Marines and British Army wears three-point-down chevrons on their sleeve and usually serves as a platoon or troop sergeant, or in a specialist position. Staff sergeant (in technical units) or colour sergeant (in the Royal Marines and the infantry), is the next most senior rank, above which come warrant officers. The Household Cavalry use the rank of corporal of horse instead, the only regiments to preserve the old cavalry tradition of having corporals but not sergeants.

A lance-sergeant (LSgt) was formerly a corporal acting in the capacity of a sergeant. The appointment now survives only in the Foot Guards and Honourable Artillery Company, where it is awarded to all corporals. A lance-sergeant wears three chevrons and belongs to the sergeants&#x27; mess, however, functionally he remains a corporal rather than an acting sergeant (e.g., he will typically command a section). In the Household Cavalry, the equivalent appointment is lance-corporal of horse.

A sergeant in infantry regiments usually holds the appointment of &quot;platoon sergeant&quot; and is second in command of a platoon. In the Royal Marines a sergeant is sometimes the commander of a platoon-sized Close Combat Rifle Troop.

==== Royal Air Force ====
The Royal Air Force also has the rank of sergeant, wearing the same three chevrons. The rank lies between corporal and flight sergeant (or chief technician for technicians and musicians).

Between 1950 and 1964 in technical trades there was a rank of senior technician which was the equivalent of a sergeant. Senior technicians wore their chevrons point up.

On 1 July 1946, aircrew sergeants were re-designated as aircrew IV, III or II, replacing the chevrons with one, two or three six-pointed stars within a wreath and surmounted by an eagle. This was unpopular and in 1950 they returned to the old rank, but have worn an eagle above their chevrons ever since.

Sergeants of the Royal Flying Corps wore a four-bladed propeller above their chevrons.

The spelling &quot;serjeant&quot; was never used in the Royal Air Force.

==== Police ====

Within the British police, sergeant is the first supervisory rank. Sergeant is senior to the rank of constable, and junior to inspector. The rank is mostly operational, meaning that sergeants are directly concerned with day-to-day policing. Uniformed sergeants are often responsible for supervising a shift of constables and allocating duties to them. Prisoner-handling stations will also have one or more separate custody sergeants who are responsible for authorising and supervising the detention of arrested persons in accordance with the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, along with the daily management and effective running of the custody suite.

Detective sergeants are equal in rank to their uniformed counterparts; only the prefix &#x27;detective&#x27; identifies them as having completed at least one of the various detective training courses authorising them to conduct and/or manage investigations into serious and/or complex crime. In British police services, not all officers deployed in plain clothes are detectives, and not all detectives are deployed within the CID. Thus, it is not unusual for detectives to supervise uniformed officers and vice versa.

Uniformed sergeants&#x27; epaulettes feature three down-pointed chevrons, above or below a personal identification number. Sergeants (and constables) in service with the Metropolitan Police, responsible for law enforcement in Greater London, have a &quot;shoulder number&quot;, analogous to the collar number of regional forces, which is distinct from the warrant number on their warrant card. This is simply a management device to help order what is by far the largest police service in the UK. In the case of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, sergeants&#x27; chevrons point upwards. This is derived from the practices of the Royal Irish Constabulary, who were a mounted police force and followed a tradition of upward-pointing ranks.

Until the abolition of first-class detective sergeants in 1973, Metropolitan Police detective sergeants when initially promoted were officially known as second-class detective sergeants.

Unlike the military and allowing for regional variations, addressing a police sergeant as &quot;sarge&quot; is commonplace. Additionally, in some forces (especially the Metropolitan Police) sergeants are referred to as &quot;skippers&quot; and again allowing for regional variations, context and expectations it is not necessarily wrong for a constable to address their sergeant as &quot;skip&quot; or &quot;skipper&quot;.

=== United States ===

==== History ====
The rank of sergeant was inherited from its use in the British Army and its colonial America regulars and militia of the several colonies. The sergeant has historically been the senior non-commissioned officer rank immediately subordinate to an officer and superior to corporal.

Commonly, in the British Army and American colonial forces there was one sergeant for each officer with the sergeants serving as the senior non-commissioned officer of each section or squad (the terms were used somewhat interchangeably). Companies would sometimes be split into half-companies, or platoons, commanded by a lieutenant, for special duties. A typical British infantry regiment of the time was essentially coincident with a battalion, with eight &quot;battalion&quot; (or line infantry) companies consisting of men equipped with muskets who fought in a line, a light company with muskets and sometimes rifles for reconnaissance and skirmishing, a grenadier company equipped with muskets, and a small support staff. Some larger &quot;strong&quot; regiments did have multiple battalions, each commanded by a major or lieutenant colonel. The regiment frequently had a ceremonial colonel-in-chief who was often a general officer or other dignitary, with day-to-day responsibility exercised by a colonel commandant, who held the rank of brigadier general (in more elite regiments) or colonel. The colonel commandant personally commanded one of the companies, in addition to having responsibility for the regiment, and had his own sergeant. While corporals and lance-corporals could be removed by order of the regimental commander, a sergeant could only be reduced in rank by a court-martial.

In British Army and its colonial American forces, infantry companies usually had three officers (a captain, lieutenant, the now obsolete rank of ensign, later second lieutenant and three sergeants, with the sergeants&#x27; primary role in combat being to protect the officers, while any officers assigned to the regiment often had a corporal as their bodyguard instead. Several higher ranks of sergeant existed, including the staff sergeant who was appointed over the other sergeants in the company, and the &quot;sergeant major&quot;, an informal designation for the senior-most sergeant in the colonel&#x27;s company, which was later formalized as a separate rank the British Army in 1797.

In battle formation, the line companies were marched into formation in three ranks consisting of the &quot;rank and file&quot; (i.e., the corporals and privates), also referred to as the &quot;bayonet strength&quot;, in order to present volley fire by rank or massed bayonets for assault or defense, with each sergeant marching with a spontoon or half-pike, which was also frequently born by officers of this period. The sergeants played less of a leadership role in combat than in modern forces, as the massed company was under the direct control of the officers, but the sergeant aided the officer by repeating commands, and by using his spontoon to signal, align the ranks, and ensure that their muskets were properly leveled. When a soldier was sentenced to lashing by company punishment or by court martial, the sergeants&#x27; spontoons would be bound together in a triangle frame to which the unfortunate soldier could be tied and lashed. Spontoons driven into the ground were also used as braces for stacking arms when not in use, one of the many tasks in which the men would frequently be supervised by a non-commissioned officer when not in combat. Many of these practices would persist in the Continental Army even as it began to adopt Prussian or French organization and drill.

Beginning in 1775, the Thirteen Colonies&#x27; Continental Army began to organize under the Continental European (i.e., Prussian-French) model, which in addition to organizing infantry companies into two platoons and forming each platoon into two ranks by section/squad, &quot;vice&quot; the three ranks of the British model, gave a more direct leadership role to sergeants by assigning two sergeants to each platoon as section/squad leaders. Sergeants began to transition from serving as the battlefield bodyguards of aristocratic officers and disciplinarians into being combat leaders integral to the tactical situation. In 1781, a fifth sergeant was authorized in each company to serve as company first sergeant, although a separate grade of rank was not established until 1831. However, from 1775, each regiment/battalion (these two terms were also used interchangeable during this time period as mentioned above) was authorized a sergeant major and a quartermaster sergeant.

The rank was used by both the U.S. Army and the Confederate army during the American Civil War. The same rank insignia was used similarly by both armies. Both varied the color of the stripes by assigning red for artillery, yellow for cavalry, blue for infantry and later in the war, green for sharpshooters. Some militia units varied these colors even further and had other colors including black and red with gold piping for various units. The rank was just below first sergeant and just above corporal. They usually commanded a section of twenty men with two corporals under him. As the war progressed these men were often in command of platoons and even companies as the units were depleted of officers during combat.

While the number of sergeants (including the first sergeant) authorized in an infantry company fluctuated from three to five during various periods of history, by the United States Civil War it was relatively fixed at four sergeants, a first sergeant, and a company quartermaster sergeant (added in 1861). In 1898 the infantry company was expanded to three platoons, increasing the number of sergeants in each company to six, along with a first sergeant and a company quartermaster sergeant. In 1905, the company quartermaster sergeant was renamed as company supply sergeant and a mess sergeant was added to the company.

In 1917, the Army reorganized under the &quot;square division&quot; plan. The size of units from company up increased significantly and there were now four rifle platoons and 12 sergeants per company, along with three &quot;staff&quot; NCOs (first sergeant, supply sergeant, and mess sergeant). While there were still two sergeants assigned as section leaders in each platoon, a new position of &quot;assistant to platoon commander&quot; was filled by the senior ranking sergeant of the three assigned to assist the lieutenant in leading the unit.

The 1939 &quot;triangular division&quot; reorganization eliminated sections in rifle platoons. In 1940, rifle squad leaders, who had been corporals, became sergeants (with two staff sergeants – one as a platoon leader and the other as a platoon guide in the platoon headquarters; the lieutenant was still titled platoon commander), with three squads/sergeants per rifle platoon. In 1942, sergeants became assistant squad leaders, with staff sergeants as squad leaders (and a technical sergeant and a staff sergeant, as platoon leader and platoon guide, respectively, in the platoon headquarters).

In 1943 &quot;platoon leaders&quot; (technical sergeants) were re-designated as &quot;platoon sergeants&quot;, while &quot;platoon commanders&quot; (officers – usually second or first lieutenants) became &quot;platoon leaders&quot;, with only company and higher-level commanding officers known as a &quot;commander&quot;. (Of note, while the U.S. Marine Corps followed the Army&#x27;s lead in re-designating the senior NCO in a platoon from &quot;assistant to platoon commander&quot; to platoon leader and then as the platoon sergeant, the Marine Corps continues to style an officer commanding a platoon as &quot;platoon commander&quot;.) In 1948, squad leaders again became sergeants (with corporals as assistant squad leaders) and finally, in 1958, sergeants became fire-team leaders under a staff sergeant as squad leader.

In 1958, as part of a rank restructuring, two pay grades and four ranks were added: sergeant (E-5) returned to its traditional three chevron insignia, E-6 became staff sergeant, which had been eliminated in 1948.

==== Army ====
In the United States Army, although there are several ranks of sergeant, the lowest carries the title of sergeant. Sergeant is the enlisted rank in the U.S. Army above specialist and corporal and below staff sergeant, and is the second-lowest grade of non-commissioned officer. The rank was often nicknamed &quot;buck sergeant&quot; to distinguish it from other senior grades of sergeants. Sergeants in the infantry, for example, lead fire teams of four men. There are two fire teams in a nine-man rifle squad, which is led by a staff sergeant. Sergeants are normally section and team leaders and are a critical link in the NCO channel. These non-commissioned officers live and work with their soldiers every day and are responsible for their health, welfare and safety. These section and team leaders ensure that their soldiers meet standards in personal appearance and teach them to maintain and account for their individual and unit equipment and property. The NCO enforces standards and develops and trains soldiers daily in their military occupational specialty and unit mission.

Drill sergeants are typically addressed as &quot;drill sergeant&quot; regardless of rank, though use of this term depends on post policy. When serving a tour as drill sergeant this is indicated by the traditional campaign hat. In late 1971, Headquarters, Continental Army Command (CONARC) received approval from the Chief of Staff of the Army for permission to include women in the Drill Sergeant Program. In February 1972, six Woman Army Corps (WAC) non-commissioned officers from Fort McClellan, Alabama, were enrolled in the Drill Sergeant Program, at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. Upon graduation, the women were authorized to wear the female drill sergeant campaign hat. Today, women drill sergeants are also referred to as &quot;drill sergeant&quot;, regardless of their rank. Both men and women drill sergeants will always wear the drill sergeant badge indicating they completed the required training program at an authorized drill sergeant academy. The army drill sergeant badge appears on the right breast pocket.

==== Marine Corps ====
The United States Marine Corps has several ranks that include the title of &quot;sergeant&quot;, the lowest of which is sergeant (E-5). Marine sergeants are the fifth enlisted rank in the U.S. Marine Corps, ranking above corporal and below staff sergeant, and are often referred to as the backbone of the Marine Corps.

Infantry sergeants typically serve as squad leaders in either a rifle or weapons platoon or as the platoon guide (i.e., assistant platoon sergeant) in a rifle platoon.

Once a Marine attains the rank of sergeant, promotions no longer derive from a composite and cutting score-based system; instead, they receive a Fitness Report, or FITREP (i.e., a formal written evaluation, grading attributes from appearance and bearing to leadership and technical proficiency).

In the Marine Corps, enlisted ranks above Staff Sergeant are referred to as staff non-commissioned officers, or SNCOs. These ranks, staff sergeant through sergeant major, are always referred to by their full rank and never merely as &quot;sergeant&quot;.

Staff sergeant is usually the lowest enlisted rank that reports directly to an officer. In the infantry this would typically be as a rifle platoon sergeant or as a section leader in a weapons platoon (i.e., machine guns, mortars, anti-tank/assault weapons).

Infantry gunnery sergeants usually serve as platoon sergeants for weapons platoons before moving up to a company gunnery sergeant billet. This position is filled by an experienced gunnery sergeant who is typically in charge of coordinating operations, logistics, and individual training for a company-sized group of Marines (approximately 180 personnel). Owing to their involvement in the management of unit supply/re-supply the &quot;Company Gunny&quot; is colloquially known to be in charge of the &quot;3 Bs&quot;: beans, bullets, and band-aids. Gunnery sergeants are commonly addressed as &quot;gunny&quot;, but never officially. Use of this informality by subordinates is permitted solely at the rank holder&#x27;s discretion.

Infantry master sergeants typically serve as the operations chief of a weapons company (in lieu of the Company Gunnery Sergeant located in the rifle companies) or as the assistant operations chief in the headquarters of an infantry regiment. Master sergeants are addressed as either &quot;master sergeant&quot; or &quot;top&quot; at the preference of the incumbent and dependent upon the commonly accepted practice within the MOS community. For example, in Intelligence (the 02 MOS field), use of &quot;Top&quot; is common; in the Infantry (the 03 MOS field) its use is nearly unheard of and aggressively discouraged.

First sergeants serve as the senior enlisted advisor (SEA) to a company or battery commander and are always addressed by their full rank title as &quot;first sergeant&quot;. However, it is common for first sergeants to be referred to as &quot;first shirt&quot; by those under their command. Unlike &quot;gunny&quot; and even &quot;top&quot;, a first sergeant is never addressed as &quot;first shirt&quot; directly.

Infantry master gunnery sergeants serve as the operations chief in the headquarters of an infantry battalion or higher level organization (viz., Marine Expeditionary Unit, regiment, Marine Expeditionary Brigade, division, Marine Expeditionary Force) and follow the same verbal address protocol as master sergeants but are commonly referred to as &quot;master guns&quot;, or &quot;master gunny&quot;.

Sergeants major serve as the SEA to a battalion or squadron, or higher level, commander, and are always addressed by their full rank title as &quot;sergeant major&quot;.

The history of the rank of sergeant in the USMC roughly parallels that of the US Army until 1942. From 1775 until WWII the Marine Corps used essentially the same rank and organizational structure as its common British and colonial forebears with the Army, as well as the later Continental and U.S. Armies. In 1942, as the Army modified its triangular-division infantry organization to best fight in the European/North African/Middle Eastern theatre, the Marine Corps began modifying the triangular-division plan to best employ its amphibious-warfare doctrine in the Pacific Theatre. This meant that for the Corps, squad leaders would remain as sergeants and the rifle squad would be sub-divided into three 4-man fire teams, each led by a corporal.

==== Air Force ====

When the United States Air Force was separated from the U.S. Army in 1947, sergeant became the second junior non-commissioned officer (NCO) grade (above Air Force corporal) of this newly created independent branch of the U.S. Armed Forces. The USAF sergeant (E-4) was equivalent to an Army corporal (since 1949) or Marine corporal (since 1958) and Navy/Coast Guard petty officer third class (since 1948), when additional enlisted grades below NCO level were implemented in these branches, moving up all enlisted ranks above for one pay grade each. 

The USAF sergeant was replaced by airman first class (A1C) in April 1952, this E-4 grade being now an enlisted rank below NCO level. From then through October 1967, there was no rank titled &quot;sergeant&quot;, though A1Cs were often called &quot;sarge&quot; or &quot;sergeant&quot; informally. 

The title &quot;sergeant&quot;, commonly and informally referred to as &quot;buck sergeant&quot;, was used again beginning in October 1967 in the hope that the prestige of being an NCO would increase the re-enlistment rate. Thus the rank of airman first class lost its E-4 status, becoming an E-3.

From June 1976 sergeant and the newly approved rank senior airman (SrA) shared the same pay grade E-4, with sergeant as lowest NCO rank and SrA as most senior enlisted personnel grade. This schism ended in April 1991, with the last promotions to sergeant. The last NCO to hold the sergeant rank without being promoted to higher rank left the Air Force in 1998. Since then, senior airman has been the sole rank at E-4.

During the period when the E-4 grade was divided, senior airmen were promoted to sergeant and granted non-commissioned officer status after 12 months time in grade; this lateral promotion is no longer conferred and senior airmen compete directly for promotion to staff sergeant (E-5). From 1976 to 1991, senior airman rank insignia had a light blue subdued central star, as did lower ranks. Sergeants and higher had, and confine to have, a silver star. 

In today&#x27;s Air Force, the term sergeant refers to all Air Force non-commissioned officers from staff sergeant up to the rank of senior master sergeant (E-8). An airman who has achieved the rank of senior master sergeant (E-8) may also be referred to as &quot;senior&quot;. An airman who has achieved the rank of chief master sergeant (E-9) is referred to as &quot;chief&quot;. Those in the grade of staff sergeant and technical sergeant (E-6) are referred to as non-commissioned officers, while those in the grade of master sergeant (E-7) through chief master sergeant are referred to as senior non-commissioned officers.

==== Space Force ====
On February 1, 2021, the United States Space Force established the rank of sergeant for the paygrade E-5, replacing the rank of staff sergeant used in the Air Force. This aligned the Space Force&#x27;s E-5 grade with the Army and Marine Corps, in which sergeants hold the grade of E-5 and staff sergeants hold the grade of E-6. In the Air Force, staff sergeants hold the grade of E-5 and the prior rank of sergeant was a non-commissioned officer in the grade of E-4, equivalent to the U.S. Army&#x27;s corporal. Sergeants rank above specialist 4 but below technical sergeant.

<doc id="219425" wikidata="Q1130275" url="?curid=219425" title="Swedish calendar">
<text>The Swedish calendar () or Swedish style () was a calendar in use in Sweden and its possessions from 1 March 1700 until 30 February 1712. It was one day ahead of the Julian calendar and ten days behind the Gregorian calendar. Easter was calculated astronomically, with a minor exception, from 1740 to 1844.

==Solar calendar==
In November 1699, the Government of Sweden decided that, rather than adopt the Gregorian calendar outright, it would gradually approach it over a 40-year period. The plan was to skip all leap days in the period 1700 to 1740. Every fourth year, the gap between the Swedish calendar and the Gregorian would reduce by one day, until they finally lined up in 1740. In the meantime, this calendar would not be in line with either of the major alternative calendars and the differences would change every four years. 

In accordance with the plan, 29 February was omitted in 1700, but the Great Northern War stopped any further omissions from being made in the following years. 

In January 1711, King Charles XII declared that Sweden would abandon the calendar, which was not in use by any other nation, in favour of a return to the older Julian calendar. An extra day was added to February in the leap year of 1712, thus giving the month a unique 30-day (30 February) and the year a 367-day length.

In 1753, one year later than Great Britain, its colonies and Ireland, Sweden introduced the Gregorian calendar. The leap of 11 days was accomplished in one step, with 17 February being followed by 1 March.

==Easter==
Easter was to be calculated according to the Easter rules of the Julian calendar from 1700 until 1739, but from 1700 to 1711, Easter Sunday was dated in the anomalous Swedish calendar, described above. 

In 1740, Sweden finally adopted the &quot;improved calendar&quot; already adopted by the Protestant states of Germany in 1700 (which they used until 1775). Its improvement was to calculate the full moon and vernal equinox of Easter according to astronomical tables, specifically Kepler&#x27;s &quot;Rudolphine Tables&quot; at the meridian of Tycho Brahe&#x27;s Uraniborg observatory (destroyed long before) on the former Danish island of Hven near the southern tip of Sweden. In addition to the usual medieval rule that Easter was the first Sunday after the first full moon after the vernal equinox, the astronomical Easter Sunday was to be delayed by one week if this calculation would have placed it on the same day as the first day of Jewish Passover week, Nisan 15. It conflicts with the Julian Easter, which could not occur on the 14th day of the moon (Nisan 14), but was permitted on Nisan 15 to 21 although those dates were calculated via Christian, not Jewish, tables (see Computus). The resulting astronomical Easter dates in the Julian calendar used in Sweden from 1740 to 1752 occurred on the same Sunday as the Julian Easter every three years but were earlier than the earliest canonical limit for Easter of 22 March in 1742, 1744 and 1750. 

After the adoption of the Gregorian solar calendar in 1753, three astronomical Easter dates were one week later than the Gregorian Easter in 1802, 1805 and 1818. Before Sweden formally adopted the Gregorian Easter in 1844, two more should have been delayed in 1825 and 1829 but were not.

Finland was part of Sweden until 1809 when it became the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland within the Russian Empire due to the Finnish War. Until 1866, Finland continued to observe the astronomical Easter, which was one week after the Gregorian Easter in 1818, 1825, 1829 and 1845. However, Russia then used the Julian calendar and Julian Easter so the comparison given above applies: that the astronomical Easter agreed with the Julian Easter about every third year but was sometimes earlier than 22 March in the Julian calendar.

<text>A hobby is a fairly small, very swift falcon with long, narrow wings. There are four birds called &quot;hobby&quot;, and some others which, although termed &quot;falcon&quot;, are very similar. All specialise in being superb aerialists. Although they take prey on the ground if the opportunity presents itself, most prey is caught on the wing; insects are often caught by hawking, and many different birds are caught in flight, where even the quick maneuvering swifts and swallows cannot escape a hobby.

The typical hobbies are traditionally considered a subgenus, &quot;Hypotriorchis&quot;, due to their similar morphology; they have ample amounts of dark slaty grey in their plumage; the malar area is black; and the underside usually has lengthwise black streaks. The tails are all-dark or have only slight bands.

Monophyly of &quot;Hypotriorchis&quot; is supported by DNA sequence data, though the exact limits of the group are still uncertain. The hobbies seem to be one of the &quot;Falco&quot; lineages which emerged around the Miocene-Pliocene boundary some 8-5 million years ago and subsequently radiated - in this case throughout the Old World. Their relationship to the peregrine falcon group and the kestrels is not well resolved, however; taxa such as the red-footed falcon appear in some respects intermediate between the kestrels and the typical hobbies.
* Eurasian hobby (&quot;F. subbuteo&quot;), also known as the northern hobby
* African hobby (&quot;F. cuvierii&quot;)
* Oriental hobby (&quot;F. severus&quot;)
* Australian hobby or little falcon (&quot;F. longipennis&quot;), uncommon but widespread in Australia, during the southern winter, some birds migrate to the north of the continent or to the islands of Southeast Asia
* Sooty falcon (&quot;F. concolor&quot;) of the North African desert
* Eleonora&#x27;s falcon (&quot;F. eleonorae&quot;) occupies the Mediterranean area during the northern summer, and migrates south to Madagascar for the southern summer.

These species are tentatively placed here:
* New Zealand falcon or &quot;karearea &quot;(&quot;F. novaeseelandiae&quot;).
* Brown falcon (&quot;F. berigora&quot;)
* Taita falcon (&quot;F. fasciinucha&quot;)

<doc id="219428" wikidata="Q1419804" url="?curid=219428" title="Appeal to fear">
<text>An appeal to fear (also called argumentum ad metum or argumentum in terrorem) is a fallacy in which a person attempts to create support for an idea by attempting to increase fear towards an alternative. An appeal to fear is related to the broader strategy of fear appeal and is a common tactic in marketing, politics, and media (communication).

==Logic==
This fallacy has the following argument form:

:Either P or Q is true.
:Q is frightening.
:Therefore, P is true.

The argument is invalid. The appeal to emotion is used in exploiting existing fears to create support for the speaker&#x27;s proposal, namely P. Also, often the false dilemma fallacy is involved, suggesting Q is the proposed idea&#x27;s sole alternative.

==Fear, uncertainty and doubt==
Fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) is the appeal to fear in sales or marketing; in which a company disseminates negative (and vague) information on a competitor&#x27;s product. The term originated to describe misinformation tactics in the computer hardware industry and has since been used more broadly. FUD is &quot;implicit coercion&quot; by &quot;any kind of disinformation used as a competitive weapon.&quot; FUD creates a situation in which buyers are encouraged to purchase by brand, regardless of the relative technical merits. Opponents of certain large computer corporations state that the spreading of fear, uncertainty, and doubt is an unethical marketing technique that these corporations consciously employ.

==As persuasion==
Fear appeals are often used in marketing and social policy, as a method of persuasion. Fear is an effective tool to change attitudes, which are moderated by the motivation and ability to process the fear message. Examples of fear appeal include reference to social exclusion, and getting laid-off from one&#x27;s job, getting cancer from smoking or involvement in car accidents and driving.

Fear appeals are &quot;nonmonotonic&quot;, meaning that the level of persuasion does not always increase when the claimed danger is increased. A study of public service messages on AIDS found that if the messages were too aggressive or fearful, they were rejected by the subject; a moderate amount of fear is the most effective attitude changer.

Others argue that it is not the level of fear that is decisive changing attitudes via the persuasion process. Rather, as long as a scare-tactics message includes a recommendation to cope with the fear, it can work.

<doc id="219432" wikidata="Q937201" url="?curid=219432" title="Eaton's pintail">
<text>Eaton&#x27;s pintail (Anas eatoni) is a dabbling duck of the genus &quot;Anas&quot;. It is also known as the southern pintail. The species is restricted to the island groups of Kerguelen and Crozet in the southern Indian Ocean. It resembles a small female northern pintail. It was named after the English explorer and naturalist Alfred Edwin Eaton. It is threatened by introduced species, particularly feral cats, which prey on it, particularly during the post-breeding molt, when it is unable to fly. 

==Taxonomy==

While previously considered a subspecies of northern pintail, the Eaton’s pintail is much smaller (one female Eaton’s pintail weighed 450 g, while the mean mass of female northern pintails is 871 g) and the male Eaton&#x27;s pintail is female-like in patterning, unlike the sexually dimorphic northern pintail.

The species was described by Richard Bowdler Sharpe based on specimens collected by Alfred Edwin Eaton. In addition to Eaton’s specimens, Sharpe also noted that earlier specimens were collected during the Ross expedition.

There are two subspecies: &quot;A. eatoni eatoni&quot; (Kerguelen pintail) and &quot;A. eatoni drygalskii&quot; (Crozet pintail).

==Description==

The Eaton’s pintail is a small duck, 35-45 cm in length, with a 65-70 cm wingspan and weighing 430-502 g in males and 400-500 g in females. Its adult male and female plumage is similarly brownish overall with cinnamon underparts, though the two sexes can be separated by the color of the speculum (green in males and brown in females) and the longer central retrices in males. Juveniles are similar to adults in plumage, but more streaked below.

==Distribution and Habitat==

The Eaton’s pintail is found exclusively on Kerguelen and Crozet Islands, though it has appeared as a vagrant on the nearby Prince Edward Islands. It summers on small lakes, pools, marshes, and other freshwater wetlands, then migrates down to coastal bays in the winter when most freshwater bodies freeze over. 

==Behavior==

The Eaton’s pintail&#x27;s diet mostly consists of small crustaceans and other invertebrates, but will also forage on seeds. It occasionally visits southern elephant seal wallows to feed. 

It breeds from November to March. Its nest is built in tussock or grass, and lined with moss and down. 

This pintail’s vocalization is similar to the northern pintail’s: a soft proop-proop whistle in males and a quack in females, but higher-pitched and quieter.

The brown skua is a primary predator of the Eaton’s pintail, especially during its post-breeding molt when it is flightless. During this period, Eaton’s pintails will often shelter themselves in dense vegetation or caves.

==Status==

Listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN. The current population appears stable, though they are threatened by introduced cats and rats. An introduction attempt on Île Amsterdam was unsuccessful, with no sightings since 1970.

<doc id="219434" wikidata="Q1321656" url="?curid=219434" title="Antonio Rivera Rodríguez Airport">
<text>Antonio Rivera Rodríguez Airport is a public airport on the island of Vieques in Puerto Rico. Because a large amount of Vieques&#x27;s yearly revenue comes from the tourism industry, this airport plays an important part in the Vieques economy. For decades, the airport has been the hub of Vieques Air Link, and also a destination for a number of small airlines.

It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a primary commercial service airport (more than 10,000 enplanements per year).

==History==
When anti-military demonstrators started flocking into Vieques in 1999, Vieques Airport saw a considerable increase to its normal yearly average of passengers. In addition, many celebrities who travelled from all over Puerto Rico and the rest of Latin America to join the protesters arrived at Vieques through this airport. When Carla Tricoli, a Vieques native, won the 2002 Miss Puerto Rico contest, her first flight as a beauty queen landed at Vieques Airport.

The airport does not accept jet aircraft, but several international flights operate from it. Most of the commercial aviation operations are domestic flights such as to Ceiba, to Isla Grande Airport in San Juan, and to Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in Carolina, a suburb of San Juan. Air ambulance flights to San Juan are also available.

Early in 2005, plans were announced to expand the airport&#x27;s runway, so that the airport could accept flights by smaller jets. This would be done in preparation for American Eagle to start operations to the airport on behalf of American Airlines via a code sharing agreement. The airline was expected to start flights to Vieques from San Juan&#x27;s Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in early 2010; however, American Eagle decided not to begin service and then subsequently ceased all code sharing flights on behalf of American in the Caribbean.

==Facilities==
Antonio Rivera Rodríguez Airport covers an area of at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 9/27 with an asphalt surface measuring .

==Airlines and destinations==

Scheduled passenger service is provided by the following airlines:
===Statistics===


==Accidents and incidents==
* On December 19, 1977, a Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander operated by Vieques Air Link en route from St. Croix ditched off of Vieques due to fuel exhaustion. Five passengers of the 10 on board were killed.
* A Beechcraft A100 King Air which belonged to Padosa Productions-a musical label to which boy band Menudo belonged-crashed with 11 people on board, 2 crew members and nine passengers, on Wednesday, August 17, 1983. The plane was on a flight from Alexander Hamilton International Airport in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands to Isla Verde International Airport in San Juan, with a stop-over at Vieques, when it confronted lifting problems on take-off from Vieques to San Juan, hitting citrus trees before it was able to stop. While there were no injuries reported, the airplane suffered substantial damage. It is unknown whether band director Edgardo Diaz or any of the band&#x27;s members at the time (Johnny Lozada, Ricky Melendez, Charlie Masso, Ray Reyes and Roy Rossello) were in the plane when it crashed. 
* Vieques Air Link Flight 901A – On August 2, 1984, a BN-2 Islander of Vieques Air Link crashed after take-off, killing all nine passengers and crew.

<doc id="219435" wikidata="Q2861102" url="?curid=219435" title="Appeal to novelty">
<text>The appeal to novelty (also called appeal to modernity or argumentum ad novitatem) is a logical fallacy in which one prematurely claims that an idea or proposal is correct or superior, &quot;exclusively&quot; because it is new and modern. In a controversy between status quo and new inventions, an appeal to novelty argument is not in itself a valid argument. The fallacy may take two forms: overestimating the new and modern, prematurely and without investigation assuming it to be best-case, or underestimating status quo, prematurely and without investigation assuming it to be worst-case.

Investigation may prove these claims to be true, but it is a fallacy to prematurely conclude this &quot;only from the general claim that all novelty is good&quot;. 

Chronological snobbery is a form of appeal to novelty, in which one argues that the only relevant knowledge and practices are those established in the last decades. The opposite of an appeal to novelty is an appeal to tradition, in which one argues that the &quot;old ways&quot; are always superior to new ideas.

Appeals to novelty are often successful in a modern world where everyone is eager to be on the &quot;cutting edge&quot; of technology. The dot-com bubble of the early 2000s could easily be interpreted as a sign of the dangers of naïvely embracing new ideas without first viewing them with a critical eye. Also, advertisers frequently extoll the newness of their products as a reason to buy. Conversely, this is satirised by skeptics as bleeding edge technology, which may itself be an example of an appeal to tradition.

==Explanation==
The appeal to novelty is based on the reasoning that in general people will tend to try to improve the outputs resulting from their efforts. Thus, for example, a company producing a product might be assumed to know about existing flaws and to be seeking to correct them in a future revision. This line of reasoning is obviously flawed for many reasons, most notably that it ignores:
* motive (a new product may be released that is functionally identical to previous products but which is cheaper to produce, or with modifications that have nothing to do with its core use, e.g. aesthetic modifications on a technological product);
* cyclicality (the fashion industry continually rediscovers old styles and markets them as the next new thing);
* (the previous product may have been created by an expert who has since been replaced by a neophyte);
* fallibility (while building the new product defects or negative side effects can be introduced undetected, effectively rendering it inferior);
* difference between local and general improvement (a new product may be superior to its previous counterpart in its core function but made lacking in other aspects, leading to a general inferior state, e.g. a product dropping some features, or becoming restricted geographically);
* cost (the new product may be better in terms of performance but have low or no return on investment if used to replace the older one).

== Examples ==
* &quot;If you want to lose weight, your best bet is to follow the latest diet.&quot;
* &quot;The department will become more profitable because it has been reorganized.&quot;
* &quot;Upgrading all your software to the most recent versions will make your system more reliable.&quot;
* &quot;Things are bad with party A in charge, thus party B will bring an improvement if they&#x27;re elected.&quot;
* &quot;If you want to make friends, you have to wear the latest fashion and the trendiest gadgets.&quot;
* &quot;Do X because it is (&quot;current year&quot;).&quot;
*&quot;You believe in X and actually believe that he did X in the 21st Century?&quot;

==Appeal to novelty fallacy: designation pitfalls==
In some cases, there may exist one or more unnamed – but still universally acknowledged – correlations between novelty and positive traits. For example, newer technology has a tendency to be more complex and advanced than older. A correlation may, for example, exist between the newness of a virus definition file and the security of a computer, or between the newness of a computer and its speed and performance. In these precise cases, something may be more likely to be superior &quot;whenever&quot; it is new and modern, though not &quot;exclusively&quot; because it is new and modern. In some restricted cases, it may even be proven. An appeal to novelty is not always a fallacy. It only becomes one if the supposed connections between the newness of something and its quality are disputed, have not been proven, or are presented as undeniable proof. In other words, it&#x27;s only a fallacy when the claim of superiority based on newness lacks valid support. Thus, what may seem like Appeal to novelty is not a fallacy in every case. 

Whenever something undergoes some sort of continuous decay, valuing novelty is justified as long as novelty restores some &quot;status quo&quot; with an anterior state (or improves on it). For instance, new clothes are arguably superior to their identical worn out counterparts, as are newly produced body parts to the old in the case of moulting. Much the same way, in aesthetics, for example in some arts and music, the value can be held not by the actual product or its performance, but rather by the sentiment of freshness and amazement that it causes; for example, many radio stations play only that music which is currently selling well (or is predicted to sell well following its imminent release), not that which has sold equally well only a few months before. The implication is that it is the currency of the popularity that confers value, rather than any intrinsic quality of the music itself, or of popularity at previous times. If it is the case, a novelty in itself – though not necessarily all forms of novelty – is a key aspect of evaluation. In those cases, if a statement comparing two art forms does mention their respective states of novelty, there is no fallacy (e.g. &quot;Song A is currently a much better bet for your party than song B.&quot;).

<text>German idealism is a philosophical movement that emerged in Germany in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It developed out of the work of Immanuel Kant in the 1780s and 1790s, and was closely linked both with Romanticism and the revolutionary politics of the Enlightenment. The period of German idealism after Kant is also known as post-Kantian idealism or simply post-Kantianism. One scheme divides German idealists into transcendental idealists, associated with Kant and Fichte, and absolute idealists, associated with Schelling and Hegel.

== Meaning of idealism ==
As a philosophical position, idealism claims that the true objects of knowledge are &quot;ideal,&quot; meaning mind-dependent, as opposed to material. The term stems from Plato&#x27;s view that the &quot;Ideas,&quot; the categories or concepts which our mind abstracts from our empirical experience of particular things, are more real than the particulars themselves, which depend on the Ideas rather than the Ideas depending on them. In the context of German idealism, the term is ambiguous because it was used in different ways by Kant and his successors, chief among them Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel. 

For Kant, our knowledge of external reality must conform to how our experience of this reality is structured by our own minds in the very act of receiving information or stimuli from it (e.g., sense data). When we abstract from the particulars, for example to discover physical forces underlying them or logical laws without which speech and thought would be contradictory or impossible, we merely &quot;discover&quot; the categorial or conceptual scheme which our own mind necessarily supplies to all our experience. We do not peer into the structure of external reality itself, as Plato believed. It remains forever inaccessible to us. 

Kant&#x27;s idealism is therefore &quot;transcendental&quot; or &quot;critical,&quot; in that it examines the categorial (transcendental) structure of possible knowledge in order to trace all knowledge claims back to their foundations in the subject&#x27;s own categorial framework. For example, Kant argues that teleological interpretations of homeostasis and autopoiesis in living things, though seemingly observable and thus empirically provable (or at least probable), are a function of our own subjective constitution projecting certain of its notions onto organized matter. Conversely, Kant makes the same critical claim about materialist reductionism, as it too is a function of certain &quot;regulative&quot; ideals (such as the drive to reduce our experience of external plurality and multiplicity to a minimum of fundamental laws, forces, and beings). For the critical idealist, it is simply not possible to &quot;know&quot; whether living things are ultimately teleological or mechanical, or something else entirely. 

Kant&#x27;s successors agreed with Kant that the subject &quot;in its ordinary state&quot; lacks immediate knowledge of external reality (as in naive realism), and that empirical knowledge based on sense data ultimately tells us only about the subject&#x27;s own categorial organization of this data. But they often interpreted this Kantian limitation on &quot;ordinary&quot; knowledge as a challenge, to be met by a more complete theory of knowledge. Attempts at such a theory often centered on special forms of intuition which Kant either deemed impossible or denied as appropriate foundations for knowledge in the strict and systematic sense, for example in the case of &quot;spiritual&quot; insights that cannot be observed, shared, and tested reliably and repeatably, and thus cannot form the basis of abstract laws about regularities in nature. 

In developing these claims, philosophers like Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel further argued that the mind-dependence of all possible experience entails a form of absolute idealism, the position that the ultimate nature of reality is ideal or mental, as in Platonism. They often viewed Kant&#x27;s transcendental or critical idealism as a &quot;necessary&quot; and admirable critique of philosophical &quot;dogmatism,&quot; but as leaving the critique of knowledge unfinished, in an intolerable state of dualism, agnosticism, and even nihilism. The post-Kantian German idealists have often been described as monists, emanationists, and nondualists as a result.

== History ==

Immanuel Kant&#x27;s work purports to bridge the two dominant philosophical schools in the 18th century: rationalism, which holds that knowledge could be attained by reason alone &quot;a priori&quot; (prior to experience), and empiricism, which holds that knowledge could be arrived at only through the senses &quot;a posteriori&quot; (after experience), as expressed by philosopher David Hume, whose skepticism Kant sought to rebut. 

Kant&#x27;s solution was to propose that, while we depend on objects of experience to know anything about the world, we can investigate &quot;a priori&quot; the form that our thoughts can take, determining the boundaries of possible experience. Kant calls this approach &quot;critical philosophy&quot;. It is less concerned with setting out positive doctrine than with critiquing the limits to the theories we &quot;can&quot; set out. 

There is, however, a positive doctrine: &quot;transcendental idealism&quot;, which is distinct from classical idealism and subjective idealism. On this view, the world of appearances is &quot;empirically real and transcendentally ideal.&quot; That is, the mind plays a central role in shaping our experience of the world: we perceive phenomena in time and space according to the categories of the understanding.

== Theorists ==

The best-known German idealist thinkers, after Kant, are J. G. Fichte, F. W. J. Schelling, and G. W. F. Hegel. Critics of Kant&#x27;s project such as F. H. Jacobi, Gottlob Ernst Schulze, and Salomon Maimon influenced the direction the movement would take in the philosophies of his would-be successors.

=== Kant ===
According to Immanuel Kant, the human mind is not capable of directly experiencing the external world as it is in itself. Instead, our experience of the world is mediated by the a priori categories and concepts that are inherent in the human mind. These categories and concepts, which Kant calls &quot;transcendental&quot; because they are necessary for any experience, structure and organize our experience of the world, but they do not provide us with direct access to the thing-in-itself, which is the ultimate reality.

Kant&#x27;s transcendental idealism has two main components. The first is the idea that the human mind is not a passive recipient of sensory information, but is actively involved in shaping our experience of the world. The second is the idea that the nature of reality is ultimately unknowable to us, because our experience of the world is mediated by the structures of our own minds.

Kant restricted the domain of knowledge to objects of possible experience. His three most notable successors, however, would react against such stringent limits.

=== Jacobi ===

In 1787, Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi addressed, in his book &quot;On Faith, or Idealism and Realism&quot;, Kant&#x27;s concept of &quot;thing-in-itself&quot;. Jacobi agreed that the objective thing-in-itself cannot be directly known. However, he stated, it must be taken on belief. A subject must believe that there is a real object in the external world that is related to its subjective representation. This belief is a result of revelation or immediately known, but logically unproved, truth. The real existence of a thing-in-itself is revealed or disclosed to the observing subject. In this way, the subject directly knows the ideal, subjective representations that appear in the mind, and strongly believes in the real, objective thing-in-itself that exists outside the mind. By presenting the external world as an object of belief, Jacobi aimed to legitimize belief – or faith – in general.

=== Reinhold ===
Karl Leonhard Reinhold published two volumes of &quot;Letters Concerning the Kantian Philosophy&quot; in 1790 and 1792. He tried to prove Kant&#x27;s assertion that humans and other animals can know only phenomena, never things-in-themselves. In order to establish his proof, Reinhold stated an axiom that could not possibly be doubted. From this axiom, all knowledge of consciousness could be deduced. His axiom was: &quot;Representation is distinguished in consciousness by the subject from the subject and object, and is referred to both.&quot;

He thereby started, not from definitions, but, from a principle that referred to representations in a conscious mind. In this way, he analyzed knowledge into (1) the knowing subject, or observer, (2) the known object, and (3) the image or representation in the subject&#x27;s mind.

=== Schulze ===
Gottlob Ernst Schulze objected to Kant&#x27;s critical philosophy as self-contradictory. According to Kant himself, the law of cause and effect only applies to the phenomena, not between phenomena and things-in-themselves. Yet, Kant directly claims that the thing-in-itself is the cause of phenomena.

=== Fichte ===
After Schulze had seriously criticized the notion of a thing-in-itself, Johann Gottlieb Fichte produced a philosophy similar to Kant&#x27;s, but without a thing-in-itself. Fichte asserted that our representations are the productions of the &quot;transcendental ego&quot;, that is, the knowing subject. For him, there is no external thing-in-itself. On the contrary, the subject is the source of the external thing, object, or non-ego.

Fichte claimed that this truth was apparent by means of intellectual intuition. That is, the truth can be immediately seen by the use of reason.

=== Schelling ===
Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (1775–1854) claimed that the Fichte&#x27;s &quot;I&quot; needs the Not-I, because there is no subject without object, and vice versa. So subjective representations are identical to the extended objects which are external to the mind. According to Schelling&#x27;s &quot;absolute identity&quot; or &quot;indifferentism&quot;, there is no difference between the subjective and the objective, that is, the ideal and the real.

=== Schleiermacher ===
Friedrich Schleiermacher was a theologian who asserted that the ideal and the real are united in God. He understood the ideal as the subjective mental activities of thought, intellect, and reason. The real was, for him, the objective area of nature and physical being. Schleiermacher declared that the unity of the ideal and the real is manifested in God. The two divisions do not have a productive or causal effect on each other. Rather, they are both equally existent in the absolute transcendental entity which is God.

=== Maimon ===
Salomon Maimon influenced German idealism by criticizing Kant&#x27;s dichotomies, claiming that Kant did not explain how opposites such as sensibility and understanding could relate to each other. As he clearly saw, this presented a serious skeptical objection to the Kantian project:

By thus pointing out these problematic dualisms, Maimon and the neo-Humean critics left a foothold open for skepticism within the framework of Kant’s own philosophy. For now the question arose how two such heterogeneous realms as the intellectual and the sensible could be known to correspond with one another. The problem was no longer how we know that our representations correspond with things in themselves but how we know that &quot;a priori&quot; concepts apply to &quot;a posteriori&quot; intuitions.

Maimon attempted to resolve this problem by introducing the concept of &quot;infinite mind&quot;. For this reason, Maimon can be said to have returned to pre-Kantian transcendent speculation. In the words of Frederick C. Beiser, &quot;by reviving metaphysical ideas from within the problematic of the critical philosophy, he gave them a new legitimacy and opened up the possibility for a critical resurrection of metaphysics.

=== Hegel ===
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel responded to Kant&#x27;s philosophy by suggesting that the unsolvable contradictions given by Kant in his Antinomies of Pure Reason applied more broadly to reality as such. Given that abstract thought is thus limited, he went on to consider how historical formations give rise to different philosophies and ways of thinking. In &quot;The Phenomenology of Spirit&quot;, he went on to trace formations of self-consciousness through history and the importance of other people in the awakening of self-consciousness. Thus Hegel introduced two important ideas to metaphysics and philosophy: the integral importance of history and intersubjectivity. 

Hegel also claims to sublate the traditional concept of God with his concept of absolute spirit. Baruch Spinoza, who changed the anthropomorphic concept of God into that of an underlying substance, was praised by Hegel whose concept of absolute knowing fulfilled a similar function. Hegel claimed that &quot;You are either a Spinozist or not a philosopher at all&quot;.

== Responses ==

=== Neo-Kantianism ===

Neo-Kantianism emphasizes the critical dimension of Kant&#x27;s philosophy as against the perceived excesses of German Idealism. It was the dominant philosophy in Germany during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Although there was considerable disagreement among the neo-Kantians themselves, they shared a commitment to some version of the &quot;transcendental method&quot;.

=== British idealism ===

In England, during the nineteenth century, philosopher Thomas Hill Green embraced German Idealism in order to support Christian monotheism as a basis for morality. His philosophy attempted to account for an eternal consciousness or mind that was similar to Berkeley&#x27;s concept of God. John Rodman, in the introduction to his book on Thomas Hill Green&#x27;s political theory, wrote: &quot;Green is best seen as an exponent of German idealism as an answer to the dilemma posed by the discrediting of Christianity...&quot;

=== United States ===

&quot;German idealism was initially introduced to the broader community of American &quot;literati&quot; through a Vermont intellectual, James Marsh. Studying theology with Moses Stuart at Andover Seminary in the early 1820s, Marsh sought a Christian theology that would &#x27;keep alive the heart in the head.&#x27; &quot; Some American theologians and churchmen found value in German Idealism&#x27;s theological concept of the infinite Absolute Ideal or &quot;Geist&quot; [Spirit]. It provided a religious alternative to the traditional Christian concept of the Deity. The Absolute Ideal &quot;Weltgeist&quot; [World Spirit] was invoked by American ministers as they &quot;turned to German idealism in the hope of finding comfort against English positivism and empiricism.&quot; German idealism was a substitute for religion after the Civil War when &quot;Americans were drawn to German idealism because of a &#x27;loss of faith in traditional cosmic explanations.&#x27; &quot; &quot;By the early 1870s, the infiltration of German idealism was so pronounced that Walt Whitman declared in his personal notes that &#x27;Only Hegel is fit for America — is large enough and free enough.&#x27; &quot;

<doc id="219448" wikidata="Q2915368" url="?curid=219448" title="Appeal to flattery">
<text>Appeal to flattery is a fallacy in which a person uses flattery, excessive compliments, in an attempt to appeal to their audience&#x27;s vanity to win support for their side. It is also known as apple polishing, wheel greasing, brown nosing, appeal to pride, appeal to vanity or argumentum ad superbiam. The appeal to flattery is a specific kind of appeal to emotion.

Flattery is often used to hide the true intent of an idea or proposal. Praise offers a momentary personal distraction that can often weaken judgment. Moreover, it is usually a cunning form of appeal to consequences, since the audience is subject to be flattered &quot;as long as they comply&quot; with the flatterer.

Examples:

:&quot;Surely a man as smart as you can see this is a brilliant proposal.&quot; (failing to accept the proposal is a tacit admission of stupidity)
:&quot;Is there a strong man here who could carry this for me?&quot; (a failure to demonstrate physical strength implies weakness)

A refusal which does not deny the compliment could be formulated thus: &quot;I may be [positive attribute], but that doesn&#x27;t mean that I will [perform action] for you.&quot;

It is not necessarily a logical fallacy, however, when the compliment is sincere, and directly related to the argument. Example:

:&quot;You are a stunningly beautiful girl – you should become a model.&quot;

<text>At the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, six archery events were contested, of which three were men&#x27;s and three were women&#x27;s competitions. 23 men and 6 women constituted the field. As was common in early Olympic archery, the events held in 1904 had little resemblance to the previous edition&#x27;s events (as early Olympic archery was not standardized). The events were formally named the 26th Grand Annual Target Meeting of the National Archery Association. While open to international entrants, no foreign competitors entered (with some archers from the Philippines entering but not competing). Team archery was introduced at these Games, as was women&#x27;s archery. The medalists were the same for both men&#x27;s individual events (George Bryant taking gold, Robert Williams silver, and William Thompson bronze in both) and both women&#x27;s individual events (Matilda Howell gold, Emma Cooke silver, Eliza Pollock bronze). Howell, an early pioneer of women&#x27;s archery, finished with three gold medals as she was a member of the only women&#x27;s team to appear in the records.

In addition to the six events currently recognized as Olympic events by the International Olympic Committee, there were also medals awarded for the top scores at each range in the Olympic events, separate flight shooting (longest distance) events, and an &quot;Anthropology Days&quot; event.

<text>Bingöl (, , ), known as Çapakçur before 1944, is a city in Turkey. It is the seat of Bingöl Province and Bingöl District, and has a population of 133,423 (2022).

==Etymology==
One of the historical names for the city, &quot;Bingöl&quot; literally means &quot;thousand lakes&quot; in Turkish; however, there are not any lakes of considerable size within the boundaries of the province. The name rather refers to many tarns found around the city.

==History==
Bingöl is located in what was historically the region of Sophene (first an independent kingdom and later an Armenian and Roman province). The settlement is mentioned by its Armenian name, Chapaghjur (meaning &quot;spread out water&quot; in Armenian), by the 11th-century Armenian historian Stepanos Asoghik, who mentions it while describing the 995 Balu earthquake. Chapaghjur is sometimes identified with the Roman fortress-town of Citharizum (&quot;Ktarich&quot; in Armenian).

In the Middle Ages, Bingöl was known as &quot;Romanoupolis&quot; () after the Byzantine emperor Romanos I Lekapenos, who incorporated it into the Byzantine Empire in 942. It initially formed a subdivision of the &quot;thema&quot; of Mesopotamia, but it was later (c. 970) elevated into a separate theme.

Bingöl was ruled by the Suwaydid dynasty, a cadet branch of the Barmakids, from the 13th century until mid-Ottoman rule, autonomously from the Ottomans. Bingöl and the surrounding district had a large Armenian population prior to the Armenian genocide. Until the middle of the 20th century, the city was known as Çapakçur/Çabakçur, derived from its Armenian name. In 1944, the place was renamed Bingöl, meaning &quot;thousand lakes&quot; in Turkish.

<text>At the 1904 Summer Olympics, twenty-five athletics events were contested. A total of 74 medals (25 gold, 25 silver and 24 bronze) were awarded.

Multi-event competitions, the all-around and triathlon, were introduced, along with a 56-pound weight throw, while the short steeplechase was lengthened slightly from 2500 to 2590 metres, the team race was lengthened from 5000 meters to 4 miles (), and the long steeplechase was dropped.

In all, the 25 events featured in 1904 were two more than were held in 1900.

A track was built specifically for the Games on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis. The track was a cinder track mile (536.448m) in length, with one long straightaway.

==Marathon==

The marathon is widely regarded as one of the most bizarre events of the Games. It was run in brutally hot weather, over dusty roads, with horses and automobiles clearing the way and creating dust clouds.
The first to arrive at the finish line was Frederick Lorz, who actually rode the rest of the way in a car to retrieve his clothes, after dropping out after nine miles, but after the car broke down at the 20th mile, he re-entered the race and jogged back to the finish line.

As officials and fans believed he had won the race, Lorz played along with his practical joke until he was found out shortly before the medal ceremony. He admitted the ruse, and was banned for life by the AAU; however, after Lorz apologized for this stunt and it was found he had no intention to defraud, he was reinstated, and won the 1905 Boston Marathon.
Thomas Hicks was the first to the finish legally, after having received from his trainers several doses of strychnine sulfate (a common rat poison, which stimulates the nervous system in small doses) mixed with egg whites and brandy. While he was supported by his trainers when he crossed the finish line, he is still considered the winner: Hicks had to be carried off the track on a stretcher, and possibly would have died in the stadium had he not been treated by several doctors. He lost eight pounds during the course of the marathon.

A Cuban postman named Felix Carvajal joined the marathon, arriving at the last minute. He had to run in street clothes that a fellow runner cut around the legs to make them look like shorts. He stopped off in an orchard en route to have a snack on some apples which turned out to be rotten, and caused him to have to lie down and take a nap. Despite falling ill from the apples, he finished in fourth place.

<doc id="219487" wikidata="Q1865205" url="?curid=219487" title="Bar association">
<text>A bar association is a professional association of lawyers as generally organized in countries following the Anglo-American types of jurisprudence. The word bar is derived from the old English/European custom of using a physical railing (bar) to separate the area in which court or legal profession business is done from the viewing area for the general public or students of the law.

Some bar associations are responsible for the regulation of the legal profession in their jurisdiction; others are professional organizations dedicated to serving their members; in many cases, they are both. In many Commonwealth jurisdictions, the bar association comprises lawyers who are qualified as barristers or advocates in particular, versus solicitors (see &quot;bar council&quot;). Membership in bar associations may be mandatory (necessary to practice law) or optional (voluntary) for practicing attorneys, depending on jurisdiction.

==Etymology==

The use of the term &quot;bar&quot; to mean &quot;the whole body of lawyers, the legal profession&quot; comes ultimately from English custom. In the early 16th century, a divided the hall in the Inns of Court, with students occupying the body of the hall and readers or benchers on the other side. Students who officially became lawyers crossed the symbolic physical barrier and were &quot;admitted to the bar&quot;. Later, this was popularly assumed to mean the wooden railing marking off the area around the judge&#x27;s seat in a courtroom, where prisoners stood for arraignment and where a barrister stood to plead. In modern courtrooms, a railing may still be in place to enclose the space which is occupied by legal counsel as well as the criminal defendants and civil litigants who have business pending before the court.

==In Commonwealth jurisdictions==

In many Commonwealth jurisdictions, including in England and Wales, the &quot;bar association&quot; comprises lawyers who are qualified as barristers or advocates (collectively known as &quot;the bar&quot;, or &quot;members of the bar&quot;), while the &quot;law society&quot; comprises solicitors. These bodies are sometimes mutually exclusive, while in other jurisdictions, the &quot;bar&quot; may refer to the entire community of persons engaged in the practice of law.

===Canada===
In Canada, one is &quot;called to the bar&quot; after undertaking a post-law-school training in a provincial law society program, and undergoing an apprenticeship or &quot;taking articles&quot;. Legal communities are called &quot;provincial law societies&quot;, except for Nova Scotia, where it is called the Nova Scotia Barristers&#x27; Society, and Quebec, where it is called the &quot;Barreau du Quebec&quot;.

The Canadian Bar Association (and its provincial and territorial branches) is a professional association of barristers, solicitors and advocates that serves the roles of advocates for the profession, provides continuing legal education and member benefits. It does not play a part in the regulation of the profession, however.

===India===
In India under the legal framework set established under the Advocates Act, 1961, a law graduate is required to be enrolled with the Bar Council of India. The process of enrollment is delegated by the Bar Council of India to the state Bar Councils wherein almost each state has a Bar Council of its own. Once enrolled with a State Bar Council, the law graduate is recognized as an Advocate provisionally for a period of two years, within which they must clear the All India Bar Examination (AIBE) conducted by the Bar Council of India. Once the advocate clears the AIBE test, they are entitled to appear and practice before any court of law in India.

There is no formal requirement for further membership of any Bar Association. However, Advocates do become members of various local or national bar associations for reasons of recognition and facilities which these associations offer. Some well-known Bar Associations in India include the Supreme Court Bar Association, Delhi High Court Bar Association, Bombay Bar Association, Delhi Bar Association, National Bar Association of India, All India Bar Association, etc.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, a person becomes a licensee of a Provincial Bar Council after fulfilling certain requirements. He must have a valid law degree LL.B from a recognized university by the Pakistan Bar Council, must offer certain undertakings, and pay the Provincial Bar Council fees. Furthermore, he shall join any bar association as a member. Tehsil bar associations work under the umbrella of District Bar Association, District Bar Association under Provincial Bar councils, such as the Punjab Bar Council, Sindh Bar Council, Balochistan Bar Council and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Bar Council. To become an advocate, one must first complete six months pupillage with a practising advocate of High Court, whom they must assist on at least ten cases during a six-month pupillage. Some well-known Bar Associations in Pakistan include the Supreme Court Bar Association of Pakistan, Lahore High Court Bar Association, Lahore Bar Association etc.

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, a person becomes an Attorney-at-Law of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka after completing passing law exams at the Sri Lanka Law College which are administered by the Council of Legal Education and spending a period of six months under a practicing attorney of at least eight years standing as an articled clerk. Attorneys may opt to become a member of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka.

==In the United States==
:&quot;Membership in the bar is a privilege burdened with conditions.&quot;
::—Benjamin N. Cardozo, &quot;In re Rouss&quot;, 221 N.Y. 81, 84 (1917)

In the United States, admission to the bar is permission granted by a particular court system to a lawyer to practice law in that system. This is to be distinguished from membership in a bar association. In the United States, some states require membership in the state bar association for all attorneys, while others do not.

Although bar associations historically existed as unincorporated voluntary associations, nearly all bar associations have since been organized (or reorganized) as corporations. Furthermore, membership in some of them (see the next section below) is no longer voluntary, which is why some of them have omitted the word &quot;association&quot; and merely call themselves the &quot;state bar&quot; to indicate that they are &quot;the&quot; incorporated body that constitutes the entire admitted legal profession of a state.

===Mandatory, integrated, or unified bar associations===
Some states require membership in a regulatory agency often called the state&#x27;s bar association in order to permit them to practice law in that state. Such an organization is called a mandatory, integrated, or unified bar, and is a type of government-granted monopoly. They exist at present in a majority of U.S. states: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington State, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

The District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands also have unified bars. The mandatory status of the Puerto Rico Bar Association was eliminated in 2009 by an act of the legislature, and ratified by the recently appointed majority of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court. By act of the Puerto Rico legislature, the mandatory status was reinstated in June 2014. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico struck down this act in October 2014, finding that it unconstitutionally usurped its powers.

In some states, like Wisconsin, the mandatory membership requirement is implemented through an order of the state supreme court, which can be revoked or canceled at any time at the court&#x27;s discretion. In others, like Oregon, the state legislature passed a law and created a government agency. California went farther than any other state and wrote the State Bar of California into its constitution.

The first state to have an integrated bar association was North Dakota in 1921.

===Voluntary bar associations===
Although the names may be confusing, a voluntary bar association is a private organization of lawyers and often other legal professionals. These associations focus on issues including social, educational, and lobbying functions. In states where the functions of the disciplinary bar entity is separate from the statewide voluntary bar association, the voluntary association does not, however, formally regulate the practice of law, admit lawyers to practice or discipline lawyers for ethical violations. For example, the &quot;State Bar of California&quot; is the mandatory, regulatory agency whereas the California Lawyers Association is a voluntary educational and networking group. A statewide voluntary bar association exists in every state that has no mandatory or integrated bar association.

In addition to state-wide organizations, there are many voluntary bar associations organized by city, county, or other affiliate community. Such associations are often focused on common professional interests (such as bankruptcy lawyers or in-house counsel) or common ethnic interests (such as gender, race, religion, or national heritage), such as the Hispanic National Bar Association or Los Angeles County Bar Association.

Such associations often advocate for law reform and provide information in bar journals, pro bono services or a lawyer referral service to the general public. In 2017, the California State Legislature split off the education, lobbying, and young lawyers sections of that state&#x27;s Bar in order to create the voluntary California Lawyers Association. This split was done to finalize the rationale and holding of a 1990 ruling which prohibited the required bar registration fees from being used for political purposes, relying on the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

As all attorney regulation is performed on the state level (while federal courts also regulate the attorney&#x27;s that appear before them, those attorneys&#x27; generally must be already qualified by the states). There is no mandatory federal bar association. The Federal Bar Association is a private, voluntary group.

There are also a number of subject-specific private associations, which are not denominated as bar associations by name but which serve similar functions in terms of providing their members with useful publications, networking opportunities, and continuing legal education. The largest association of defense counsel is the Defense Research Institute, which describes itself as &quot;The Voice of the Defense Bar&quot;, while the largest association of plaintiffs&#x27; counsel is the American Association for Justice (formerly the Association of Trial Lawyers of America). The American Bar Association (ABA) is the largest voluntary bar association in the United States with members from both defense, plaintiff, civil, criminal and other specialities. The National Lawyers Guild (NLG) is an association of progressive attorneys and legal workers, founded as the first national association for lawyers whose membership was open to all races and religions.

Most American law schools have a student bar association, which is a student organization that fulfills various functions, including sometimes serving as the student government.

===Judges===
Judges may or may not be members of the bar. Etymologically, they sit &quot;on the bench&quot;, and the cases which come before them are &quot;at bar&quot; or &quot;at bench&quot;. Many states in the United States require that some or all judges be members of the bar; typically these limit or completely prohibit the judges from practicing law while serving as a judge.

The United States Constitution contains no requirement that Federal judges or Supreme Court of the United States justices be members of the bar. However, there are no modern instances of the President of the United States nominating or the U.S. Senate providing advice and consent to any nominee who is not a member of any bar. The unofficial practice of the American Bar Association publicly rating the qualifications of judicial nominees has strengthened the imperative to nominate lawyers on the bar. There are various professional associations of judges, such as the American Judges Association, that perform some of the educational and other service functions of bar associations.
